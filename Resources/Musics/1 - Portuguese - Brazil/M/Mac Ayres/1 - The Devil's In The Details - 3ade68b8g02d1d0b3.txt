THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS

I don't wanna wake up from it
You've given me a place and time
They say the devil's in the details baby
You're really drawin' out your light
And now I'm settin'
On lettin'
You know what's on my mind (what's on my mind)

Oh what's on my mind
On my mind

I hope you gon' let me show
All the things that
I would be on (I would be on, I would be on)
I hope you gon' let me know
Should I stay or should I get goin'
Should I get goin' (oh)

She don't wanna hear nothin' from me
Say she heard it all before
I'll be waitin' for you baby, baby, baby
Like it's somethin' I keep fallin' for

Fall for you
Fall for you
Yeah right

I hope you gon' let me show
All the things that
I would be on (I would be on, I would be on)
I hope you gon' let me know
Should I stay or should I get goin'
Should I get goin'
I hope you gon' let me show
All the things that
I would be on
I hope you gon' let me know
Should I stay or should I get goin'
