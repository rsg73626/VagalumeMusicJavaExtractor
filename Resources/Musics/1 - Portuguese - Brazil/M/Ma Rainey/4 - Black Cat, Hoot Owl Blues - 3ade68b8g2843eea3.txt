BLACK CAT, HOOT OWL BLUES

Black cat on my door-step, black cat on my window-sill
If one black cat don't cross me, another black cat will
Last night a hoot owl come and sit right over my door
A feelin' seems to tell me I'll never see my man no mo'
I feel my left side a-jumpin', my heart a-bumpin', I'm mindin' my P's and Q's
I feel my brain a-thumpin', I've got no time to lose
Mama's superstitious, tryin' to overcome these blues
