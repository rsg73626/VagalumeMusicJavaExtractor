THE UNNAMED TRAIN SONG

Will I be okay?
Will you survive this?
Will they believe me?
Your insinuations are crimes
Will you hear me out?
No one can see us here
My screams are useless
Like my attempts to get out

It hit so hard
Like a bullet through my heart
When will it end?
I still remember your face
As the light hit the car
As the light hit the car

Just imagine
What it felt like for me
Ill just be the next victim on Tv
I cried for help
My words were lost
I tried to settle this at any cost

It hit so hard
Like a bullet through my heart
When will it end?
I still remember your face
As the light hit the car
Will you survive this?
[x2]

I cried for help

It hit so hard
Like a bullet through my heart
When will it end?
I still remember your face
As the light hit the car
Will you survive this?
[x2]
