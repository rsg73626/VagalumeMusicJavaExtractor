INCURABLE

I'd like to think I'm not addicted. Another hit
I remain unaffected
Smooth, sleek, reliable. A meeting with my glass
This could be mayhem; this could be chaos

The night before, a dosage more
bring me back my insanity
The higher I rise, the fast I fall
and one of these days you won't know me at all

Go. I'm like the salt in your senses. Sly, sharp, relentless
I'm your fear injected. Watch me cool, calm, collected
Embrace this mobile escape cause I'm coming down fast
Like a toothpick into the gum. The fragile underpass

Help me escape from this place
Help me escape from this place

The night before, a dosage more
bring me back my insanity
The higher I rise, the fast I fall
and one of these days you won't know me at all

Help me escape from this place
Help me escape from this place
