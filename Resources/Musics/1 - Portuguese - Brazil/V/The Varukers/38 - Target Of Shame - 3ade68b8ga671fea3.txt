TARGET OF SHAME

another explosion terrorist game
innocent victim I don't understand

Attack the wrong people target of shame
You cowardly bastard fear is your game

Another device explodes in your face
Another life cant be replaced

City ruin a village in mourn
helpless child a mother cries

Body count rising wreckage remains
Fanatical vengeance no fear no shame
