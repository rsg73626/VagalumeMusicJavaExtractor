MOUNTAIN TOP

Save a drop of rain
In a glass
Keep it safe
Until it falls again
Then set it free
Into the sea

Lovers will turn
Into stone and sand
Up on a mountin top

Never gonna be the same

Lovers will turn into stone and sand
Up on a mountin top

A drop of pain
In a glass
Keep me safe
Until I come again
Then set me free
Into the sea
