HEAVY METAL NIGHT

My name is Paulista, I’m a crazy guy
I drink all the beers, And kiss all the pretty girls
This a true history Of the carnaval in Guriri
It was heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy

Heavy metal night!
Wide on the streets
Heavy metal night!
I feel so good
Heavy metal night!
I drink my beer
Heavy metal night!
And kiss my girl

I sleep on the shit, I drunk benflogin
I stay com Marlin Mason, I smell loló
The night in Guriri is so fucking cool
So let’s fucking go to
The fucking heavy metal night
