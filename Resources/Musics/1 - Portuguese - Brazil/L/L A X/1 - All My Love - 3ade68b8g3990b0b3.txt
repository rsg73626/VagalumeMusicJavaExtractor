ALL MY LOVE

Girl, the world is changin' fast

It's gettin' harder and harder
To tell if love will last
You, you're turnin' out to be
A liberated lady with a destiny

Independence; you don't wanna lose
But a little love you can always use
So at the risk of being a male chauvinist
This is a chance for love
That I don't wanna miss
So you can have

All my love, baby
All my sweet, sweet love
I'll give it all to you
Just wanna be with you, ooh-wee, baby-yeah-heah-heah
And when my life time ends
I'll do it all again, just to love you girl, girl, girl, girl

Ohh, baby, sweet lady
Let me explain
Ahh, no wonder you've had so many men
Baby, you can't deny it
A run away love it might have been
'Cause men are so possessive at the start

They can except a woman
Without putting' a chain around their heart
But I won't hold you down
That would only lose the love I found

Can't you see
I'm just dealing with reality?
Like any other man
I've got to be sure
Before I give

All my love, ba-by
All my love, whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-woah
I'll give it all to you
'Cause I've thought the whole thing through, love to, girl
And now it's mine for sure
Tonight's my night with you, baby

Don't you go away
I just what you to stay with me, lady
I-I, I love you, girl, girl, girl

You realize, we look for love that's true
Baby, you know I'm ready
Ready to fall for you
Ooh, don't you push me away
I won't let you slip back into yesterday

'Cause independence; you don't wanna lose
And a little love we can always use
So at the risk of being a male chauvinist
This is a chance for love
That I don't want to miss, oh
You can have

All my love, baby
All my sweet love
Listen, girl, I'll give it all to you

I've thought the whole thing through
'Cause I love you, baby, yeah
I know you're mine for sure
Tonight love might choose you, girl

All my love... baby
All my l-l-love, listen

All my love
(I won't let you slip into yesterday)
All my love
(no, girl, don't push me away)
All my love
(ooh-wee love, look for a love that's true)
(lady, lil lady, ready to fall for you)
All my love
(all-all-all my, my love, yeah, yea-heah-heah)
