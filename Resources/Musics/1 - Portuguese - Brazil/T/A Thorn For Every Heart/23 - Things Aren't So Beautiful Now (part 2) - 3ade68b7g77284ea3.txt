THINGS AREN'T SO BEAUTIFUL NOW (PART 2)

"Things Aren't So Beautiful Now (Part 2)"

Seems like years as the temple rings,
Chokes gas with the awful news it brings.
How comes she's been avoiding,
She knows hes reached the end.

Hooked up to the respirator,
Please laugh into my callud lungs.
My hearbeat's getting fainter,
And all my time has gone.

It's getting colder,
Deciding to show her that i'm not the one,
To be there beside her, now I'm crossing over 
can no one console her.

I know she'll remain,
with no way to end this pain.

No one seems to realize, the things that I,
The things that I've done to you.
Why do you paint your love with all your heart,
with all that a heart can give.

Intentions that you'll never know,
The reason why I had to lead astray.
I gave you a last time, a painted remorse.
(Mistakes that were never yours)

The wrong in my life can never relate,
it flashes before my eyes...

(How did he come to this,
His mind is working harder then ever before, 
Thousands of thoughts in seconds,
His last thoughts were of her...)

(And how he and he alone had destroyed the once
vibrant spirit he had inherited so deeply.
The last pain he had ever caused is to the only
woman that had ever loved him..)

The bright light its calling me over,
I follow and leave you alone.
Now your all alone,
And that evening with nobody by your side,
Not to hurt you ever again,
Never break your spirit's torment.

Now I'm all alone,
Your still a challenge with the things you gave into me

The bright light is calling me over, I follow and leave you alone.
