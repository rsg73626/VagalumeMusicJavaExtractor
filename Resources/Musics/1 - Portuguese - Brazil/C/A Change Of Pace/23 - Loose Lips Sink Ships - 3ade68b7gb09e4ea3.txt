LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS

And we both hope 
This will pass by 
Through are life lines 
Standing broken 

Come on tell me 
You cant hurt me 
Dont ignore the 
Lies your bleeding 

Entranced in noise 
And words and phrases 
All about you 
Everyone was so right 

I know something you dont know 
You hid something obvious from me 
I know something you'll never know 
You hid something obvious from me 

Envy sets in 
And I hate you 
For what you did 
I will break you 

Cry for help now 
They cant hear you 
Heres an offer 
You cant refuse 

Scream a little bit louder for me baby 
Face the truth 
That you baited so well 

I know something you dont know 
You hid something obvious from me 
I know something you'll never know 
You hid something obvious from me 

Scream my name 
At the top of your lungs 
Help me to know 
Why I should care 

Destroy our past 
I'll still have 
These memories 
You'll never take from me 

I know something you dont know 
You hid something obvious from me 
I know something you'll never know 
You hid something obvious from me 

Scream my name!
