THE WITCH

She thaught them hard
She thaught them well
Thirty years, cold as hell
But kids are cruel at the recess bell
Children laugh, children yell

Ding dong the witch is dead

She put tem first
Before herself
Self sacrifice she cast her spells
She saw them turn from books and school
Pencils down, the broken rule

Ding dong the witch is dead
Ding dong the witch is dead
Ding dong the witch is dead

Red red rover bring the witch on over
Break the line gonna send her off to hell
Well you know we're gonna slow her on down
Oh it's just as well

And the beat goes on

She thaught them hard
She thaught them well
Through the years
Through cracks they fell
Kids are cruel at the recess bell
Children laugh, children yell

Ding dong the witch is dead
Ding dong the witch is dead
Ding dong the witch is dead
