DEAD END

Don't turn around.
Keep going.
If I do look back,
I'll never get over you.
Any ounces of doubt,
Don't show them.
In this ancient game,
Where players never lose.

Why did it fail?
For what reason?
How many times,
And whom, must I ask to know?
Just a long way around,
Or a dead end?
Bound for a place I could only reach alone
