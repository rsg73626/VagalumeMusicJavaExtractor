SHOW 'EM THE ROPES

just hold your breath
to make sure you wont wake up again
cause you ruined my 04
that's the best that i could hope for
to watch you fall apart from the inside
we're gonna spread it to the world
to the world
about how you lied
how you lied

a free lesson on growing up
never trust anyone to the point
where your backs exposed
every person i've ever known was a fake
and you'll see your closest ones go first
who needs enemies you've got friends

i'm a gentleman and you're a liar
i expect the best of you but it's so hard
but it's so hard

lets start over
when we reach the top well watch you bury yourself
this wasn't easy
it wasn't easy

a free lesson on growing up
make the best of their worst
and never compromise what you feel is right
i make a point to be powerful when i speak
be the one that gives them nightmares when they sleep
never back down from anyone

i watched the weight of your world
cave in to crush you
