IN MY MIND

You, you are in my mind
I better keep trying
To make you go away
Or I'll became insane
You, you are every thing I want
You are every thing I hate
You're every thing I love
Every thing I can't stay away
I'am better without you
It is good remind you
Why didn't I stay

You, you are a liar
You, are an idiot, but you love me, yeah

I'll pretend that a beliave that

I'm better without
It's good to remind you
What made me hate you
You, you don't worth the pain
I'm pushing you out of brain
Refr√£o
You're never coming back
Go away

Now it's decided what I'm
Going to do
Will not think about you
I won't love you anymore
You won't walk into my door
Not anymore

I'm better without
It's good to remind you
What made me hate you
You, you don't worth the pain
I'm pushing you out of brain

You're never coming back
Go away
