PROMISES

[Verse]
I've been waiting so long, 
To see the moon rising by your side, 
How many days, since you're gone 

I've cried so many times, 
But I've spent so many hours to hide, 
The tears I had in my mind 

[Bridge]
When will I see you again, 
Give me a last chance to make 
Love, with you forever and ever again, 
I miss you, 

[Chorus]
I can't feel pain anymore, 
I'm just lost in a world of sorrow, 
But I will wait the hour 
To set your heart on fire 

[Verse]
Mountains of ice i will cross 
Fountains of gold I will find, 
To give you some presents, 
As precious as you 

In endlessly I will shout, 
Your name in the silence of night, 
To exorcise my thoughts, as a prayer 

[Bridge]
When will I see you again, 
Give me a last chance to make 
Love, with you forever and ever again, 
I love you, 

[Chorus]
I can't feel pain anymore, 
I'm just lost in a world of sorrow, 
But I will wait the hour 
To set your heart on fire
