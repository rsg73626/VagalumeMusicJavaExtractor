THE OTHER WOMAN

She picked up his jacket
And hid her earrings in his pocket
So he'd have a reason to call
But her telephone won't ring
And the shame that it will bring
Makes her regret it all

She should be accustomed
She oughta know you just can't trust 'em
When he's got a wife that he ain't gonna leave
Maybe she deserves what she's got comin'
She can't hide and there's no runnin'
From the guilty, lonely life she's bound to lead

chorus:

'Cause she's the other woman
You've seen her before
Deep in his eyes
When he walks through the door
But did you know that even though
She's puttin' you through hell
You don't have to hate the other woman
She'll do it herself

They tried to keep it undercover
But you would soon discover
That she's your worse nightmare comin' true
You don't even know her name
But you wish her a life of pain
And believe you me that's what she's goin' through

chorus

No, you don't have to hate the other woman
She'll do it herself
