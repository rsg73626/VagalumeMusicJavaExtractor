THIRTEEN AUTUMNS OF MY SOLITUDE

All my life I enjoyed watching myself
Myself in the mirror
But on one grey nightmare day
I realized my shadow disappeared

In sadness I recollect the past years
Sitting at the round oak table
My tears run in the stream
When I assure in the mirrors truth

Thirteen autumns of my solitude
Thirteen autumns of my sorrow

I'm like a confused child was scarily watching
At the dark corner of my old room
It was turning grey while watching
Bathing in the sunset of dying rays

My last autumn opened my eyes
And now I'm looking into the face
Of death without a fear
I felt in love with silence and now I enjoy it
And I don't want my peace to be disturbed by anyone

I led around the autumn leaves in my wither garden
In my grieving dreams I fly into
Dark forest of my solitude
On my young face I can't see any wrinkles
On my blanching lips I feel drunk smell of blood

I like falling asleep during cold autumn morning
When the grief going through my veins
My sleep walks away in the rays of dying sunset
And again I'm staying alone

In sadness I recollect the past years
Sitting at the round oak table
My tears run in the stream
When I assure in the mirrors truth
