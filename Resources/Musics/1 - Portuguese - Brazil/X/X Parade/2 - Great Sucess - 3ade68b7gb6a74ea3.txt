GREAT SUCESS

Our great successes
they are breastbones

We didn't never give up...
And nor for anybody...

Only the death will separate...
We will never stop.

Our great successes
they are part of our history...

A simple melody for you...
A love poem that I  will feel...

Our great successes...
They are part of our lives.
