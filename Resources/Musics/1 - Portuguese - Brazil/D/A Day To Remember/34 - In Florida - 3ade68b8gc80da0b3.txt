IN FLORIDA

December ain't cold at all this year in Florida. 
But I'm still chilled to the bone. 
The mind plays tricks this time of year in Florida. 
It's not the time to be alone.

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.
I feel to understand it starts from the inside.
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.

Time stands still this time of year in Florida.
The only time I feel at home.
The neighborhood kids run down the road in Florida.
It's got me scared I missed the boat.

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.
I feel to understand it starts from the inside.
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.

I always knew that I would leave,
but I didn't think it'd change a part of me.
Can't get back to who I was back then.
Feels wrong to shut that out.
Seems wrong to pretend.

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.
I feel to understand it starts from the inside.
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.
