GEORGIA WOMEN

I don't know, but I been around, tell me them women shake 'em on down
Yes, I'm goin' Georgia line, see if them women sweet like mine
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet
jelly roll
Yeah, I don't know, but I been around, tell me them Georgia women shake 'em on down.
Yes, I'm goin' Georgia line, see if them women sweet like mine
