OUT OF CONTROL

Where do we go now? out of this place
The world keeps falling apart any way
Where do we go now? we've gotta go
Before this last chance is gone

Just turn around and let it begin
Don't waste your time again trying to
Understand, this shithole is out of control
Just burn this world and go!

Out of control!

And destiny begins to run
All those days are gone
It seemed so faraway
Out of the hole

And destiny begins to run
All those days are gone
It seemed so faraway

Where do we go now? we've gotta leave
Don't try to understand it
This world makes me sick
Where do we go now? we've gotta go
While we can dig out of this hole

Don't waste it
Don't do it
