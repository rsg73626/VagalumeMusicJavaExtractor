HOME FOR CHRISTMAS

Baby this christmas
My gift to you would be... me

So far away, it's been too long
Seems like a billἰon days
Since I've been gone
All my thoughts and prayers has been of you

Well guess what baby
I've got some good news
I had a talk with my boss
And I take some time off, baby

I'm comin' home for christmas
I'm comin' home for christmas (baby, baby)
I'm comin' home for christmas
I'm comin' home for christmas

Oh, workin' baby day and night
I hardly ever get to spend quality time
I can't take ἰt, no, your love I miss it
And I'll be seein' ya
Soon because I got myself a ticket
See ya

I had a talk with my boss
And I take some time off, baby

I'm comin' home for christmas
I'm comin' home for christmas (baby, baby)
I'm comin' home for christmas
I'm comin' home for christmas

Won't let another minute
Hour, day take off back
Or spend another second girl
Without you by my side
I refuse to spend this christmas... no no
Said I refuse to spend this christmas
Without my baby by my side
Surprise, surprise

I'm comin' home for christmas... hey baby
I'm comin' home for christmas
Straight home to you baby baby
I'm comin' home for christmas
So have your arms open for me
I'm comin' home for christmas
And I'll, I'll be bringin this lovin'
Home to you
I'm comin' home for christmas
Walk in the door, you standin' there
Make love to you everywhere
I'm comin' home for christmas
I'm so excἰted, I'm comin' home
For christmas... yeah
