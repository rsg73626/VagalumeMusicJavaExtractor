BREAKOUT

It just happend 
So what? 
But they're all laughing 
What's up? 

[Hook] 
Why the tears have no fear 
We are here for you 
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel 
When no-one cares 

[Chorus] 
If you feel just like I feel, PUSH PEOPLE 
Baby, everything is plastic, nothing is real, PUSH PEOPLE 
Fuck your lover makes not steal, PUSH PEOPLE 
We just dance and no big deal, PUSH PEOPLE 
He just let the bullshit pass, PUSH PEOPLE 
So we just skateboard your ass, PUSH PEOPLE 
Got my bones, my wheels, PUSH PEOPLE 
We just dance and no big deal, PUSH PEOPLE 

Break out [x11]

All you can be is just you cause 
You're real not the plastic type. 
But reality sets and 
You're stuck in this plastic life. 

[Hook] 
Why the tears 
We are here for you 
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel 
When nothing cares. 

[Chorus] 

Break out [x11]

Hey! 
Shit happens, hey, just blow it off, whooo, 
Man, don't it make you feel rage, rage, yeah 
Hey! 
Shit happens, u-uh, just blow it off, whooo, 
Man, don't it make you feel rage, rage, yeah 
Just aslong we got the same thing in our vains, 
You and I, we are both the same 
I bail you out and show you what you see 
'bout love, N*E*R*D, peace
