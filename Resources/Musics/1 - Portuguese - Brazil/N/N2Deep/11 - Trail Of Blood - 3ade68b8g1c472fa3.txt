TRAIL OF BLOOD

Strapped down to the table
Unable to move
Face covered
Unable to see
The stereo on to muffle your screams

Selected for reasons
Unknown to you
Abducted dead before
The night is through

Shocked with the cold metal
As it scrapes against your skin
The blindfold is removed
Bright light shines into your eyes
Slowly regaining sight
You can see the gleaming blade of the hunting knife
Gradually pressing harder
Finally piercing through the skin

Selected for reasons
Unknown to you
Abducted dead before
The night is through

Methodically torturing you
Step by step
Despite all your cries for mercy
Your captor is slowly killing you

Now cutting
Layer by layer
Before long
Stabbing furiously
