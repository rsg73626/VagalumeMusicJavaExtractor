DANCE ALL NIGHT

Dance all night mou tomerarenai
So hold me tight mawaru kono sekai
Dance all night itsu made mo kimi to
One more time odoritsudzuketai
Mayonaka sugi no taxi
Katate de miseru id
Hazumu biito to rydeen
Watashi wo maneku party

Dekame no sangurasu
Neon karaa no neiru
Ibiza no kaanibaru
Kirameki ga on the floor

Dance all night mou tomerarenai
So hold me tight mawaru kono sekai
Dance all night itsu made mo kimi to
One more time odoritsudzuketai

Dance with me please
Till we call the police
Never gonna leave
Till di sun come down
Sun come down
Time ta bounce

We takin ova and ova
We're takin ova and ova and ova
It's never ova

If you move with me
We can drink chablis
You can feed me diamonds all night, yeah

And now it's on to the next one
To the next one
To the next one (to the afterparty)
To the next one
To the next one
And the next one

Dance all night mezameru hoshitachi
It's time to shine kono omoi mune ni
Dance all night doko made mo kimi to
In my eyes ima wo utsushitai

Sukoshi yaketa hada wo nurashite
Furisosogu oto abitara
Gurasu oite asahi daite
Yubi to yubi wo karameau
Kawaranai de it's just like paradise
Mata koko de hikareaou

Dance all night
Dance all night mou tomerarenai
Just you & I nanni mo iranai
Dance all night itsu made mo kimi to
Feel the light kagayakitsudzuketai

Dance all night
