LOST HEAVEN

Woah! kasaneawaseta yume wo daite hateshinai rakuen e
mou nakusu mono sae mitsukaranai kakenuketa haruka na michi
nani hitotsu utagau koto mo shiranakatta ne

We'll say goodbye, Lost Heaven
How we longed for Heaven
We're letting go of something we never had
Time goes so fast, Heaven is lost

te wo nobashi tsukanda yume wa sotto kuzureyuku suna no shiro
tada tachitsukushiteta wakaremichi hohoemi wo nokoshite
kiete itta kimi ga egaku rakuen e to

We'll say goodbye, Lost Heaven
How we longed for Heaven
We're letting go of something we never had
Time goes so fast, Heaven is lost

hitotsu ni narenai ukanda hoshikuzu
hitotsu no shuuen ni akai hanataba wo

kakedashita shisen no saki ga shinkirou demo
We'll say goodbye, Lost Heaven (x4)

We'll say goodbye, Lost Heaven
How we longed for Heaven
We're letting go of something we never had
Time goes so fast, Heaven!

We'll say goodbye, Lost Heaven
How we longed for Heaven
We're letting go of something we never had
Time goes so fast, Heaven is lost (x3)

I wish you good luck. I still remember every day. (x3)
