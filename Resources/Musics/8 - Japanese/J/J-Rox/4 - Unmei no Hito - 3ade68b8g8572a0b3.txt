UNMEI NO HITO

Me wo samasu to boku no mae ni wa
Dare ga iru no
Atteiru ka wakaranai
Michi nori wa wabishige dakedo
Aruki tsuzukeru anata ni aeru made
Aeru sono toki made
Jikan wa boku wo mattekurenai mayowanai de anata
No moto e

Anata wa boku ni nani wo motomeru no
Mienai sugata ga itoshikute

I will bet on fate
To unfold everything
Beyond my silly doubts
I know that all makes sense

What will it bring to me
Uncertain journey ahead
Although the odds are low
I'll keep going for it

Take the right way meant to you can be a really
Tough path to walk on
But it's much better than just runaway
And let the easy bullshit go on

Anata wa boku ni nani wo motomeru no
Mienai sugata ga itoshikute

Calm down, shinkokyuu
Hurry up, futatsu ni hitotsu

Boku wa shinjiteru kono michi no mukou ni
Anata ga iru koto kanarazu mitsukedashite miseru
Hontou no jibun de
Unmei ga subete wo oshiete kureru
Futari ga koko de deau koto wo

Anata wa boku ni nani wo motomeru no
Mienai sugata ga itoshikute

I will bet on fate
To unfold everything
Beyond my silly doubts
I know that all makes sense

What will it bring to me
Uncertain journey ahead
Although the odds are low
I'll keep going for it
