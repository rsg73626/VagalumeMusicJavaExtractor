BREAK UP

Kikeru wake ga nai uwasa wa shinjitsu
kimi wa fantastic girl
Kanashi ge na hitomi what's wrong?
Sono kageri wa nani be mine kyū ni aseru yo

In the dark tada kimi wa tenderly itazura na
Suteru, boku o yobu emotion dakishimeru
Tell me why kurabeteru kakushiteru can you feel me?

Just can't get enough I want you subete o misete
Just can't get enough I want you boku dake o mite
Nazo meku kimi ga nagekakeru no wa
Oh break up break up break up oh break up break up

You gonna know how I feel, my feeling is all for you
All the time 24 7, I'm on you
But if it's like red light green light, stop and go
So just forget about the rest cuz we ain't ever go slow

Gēmu kankaku da ne koi o tanoshimu no?
Mujaki na dangerous mind
Honki ni sase tara my girl kimi o hanasanai
true love kore ga wana demo

(Close to me) maki kami ga deep in touch mayoikomu
(You and I) meikyū de (tell a lie) dakishimeru
(Through the world) saigo da to
(whispering) keri o tsukeru, can you feel me?

Just can't get enough I want you donna kimi demo
Just can't get enough I want you aishitsuzukeru
Oe ba ou hodo kimi no pēsu da
Oh break up break up break up oh break up break up

Gonna lose control so we gotta go
Stop time like your first time breaking down for the last time
So just stop lying to me now jumpin? Up and down
Stompin' on the ground spinning round and round
Hope you're hinting that this is all just a dream
In this game that we call love it was only me
You said that you love me it was harder to see
The only thing you wanted was to pack up and leave

Just can't get enough I want you subete o misete
Just can't get enough I want you boku dake o mite
Nazo meku kimi ga nagekakeru no wa
Oh break up break up break up oh break up break up

Just can't get enough I want you donna kimi demo
Just can't get enough I want you aishitsuzukeru
Oeba ou hodo kimi no pēsu da
Oh break up break up break up oh break up break up

We will never break up
Oh baby
We will never break up (will never break up yeah)
Oh baby
Oh break up break up break up oh break up break up
