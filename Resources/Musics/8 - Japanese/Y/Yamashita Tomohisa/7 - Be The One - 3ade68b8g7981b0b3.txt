BE THE ONE

Hey, you can believe me
Oh, why don't you put your love in me?
Oh, just keep walking together
You and I are meant to be the one
Oh, be the one

I need to know how to break the distance
Stepping very slowly, take the hands and let's dance
Oh, no matter what happens
I just wanna get your heart
I believe it's gonna be good for you

Girl, nani ga mieten no
Kimi no tokoro kara
Ne, chanto todoiten no
Every word I sing with my guitar
Means my love for you forever

Hey, you can believe me
Oh, why don't you put your love in me?
Oh, just keep walking together
You and I are meant to be the one
Oh, be the one

I need to know how to get close to you
Raining very hard, I'll stop it for your beautiful sky
No matter how I feel you, I'm not satisfied at all
Oh, I promise it's gonna be good for you

Girl, issho ni mai odorou
Futari dake no groove de
Ne, oh, chanto todoiten no
Every word I sing with my guitar
Means my love for you forever

Hey, you can believe me
Oh, why don't you put your love in me?
Oh, just keep dancing together
You and I are gonna, gonna be the one

Hey, you can believe me
Oh, why don't you put your love in me?
Oh, just keep walking together
You and I are meant to be the one
Oh, be the one

Oh, be the one
