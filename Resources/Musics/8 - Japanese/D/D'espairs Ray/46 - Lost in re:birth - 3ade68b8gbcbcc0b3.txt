LOST IN RE:BIRTH

Repeating tragedy

All minds are distraught!
You'Re distrait!
Deeper and deeper you fall
Just stray in the fake!
But feel pain
Where have you sealed your real side?

Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you a. s. a. p. !
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you a. s. a. p. !

All minds are distraught!
You'Re not right!
Deeper and deeper you fall
Just stray in the fake!
But feel doubt!
Where have you sealed your real side?

Nagareta kanashimi no storm
Aijou wo kakikesu you ni hai ni shita

Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you a. s. a. p. !
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you
Gotta awake you a. s. a. p. !

Lost in re: birth... Alone
Yamanai ai ni afureta
Eien ha doko ni?
Lost in re: birth... Alone
Kareta sekai ni sukui to shiawase wo
negai
Hitori naiteita

Dying
To be bone
What do you think of justice?
The blight and god
Why cannot the faith mesh well?

Please tell me the answer!
Loud crying out!
Far infected sorrow Hard rain falls down
World minus affection Never loveless life be enough

Lost in re: birth... Alone
Subete ga ai ni afureta eien ha doko ni?
Lost in re: birth... Alone
Umare kawaru sono toki ha aishite kudasai
Lost in re: birth

All for my dears
From "ache"

To live disease
All of us die with it
When you pass away, does anyone cry for you?
Nobody's next to me
Even the one to cry over me
