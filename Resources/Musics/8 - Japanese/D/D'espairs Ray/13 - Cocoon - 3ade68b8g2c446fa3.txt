COCOON

drowning While I fall [breakout]

Sick of myself
shizukana tsuki  koi  yokubou
so I wish for myself
eikyuuÂ¹ ni  fukanzensa wo

Time is coming. Give me some courage
zutto nigemadotteru forest
Time is coming. Give me some courage
zutto fusaideita withdraw whithin

I pray to find a place where to leave my pain.
somewhere I can hide. shut out!
I am looking for a place where I can cry
sono te wo tsukamitai

[I can't stay]  akai ryuusei yo  kono mi tsuranuitekure
[hold out... your hands]  moroku oboreteku kokoro yaki tsukushite

Sick of myself
tashikana ai,  yume  gensou
so I wish for myself
ware ga mi  tsumi fukaku  itoshii

I pray to find a place where to leave my pain.
somewhere I can hide. shut out!
I am looking for a place where I can cry!
sono te wo kegashitai

[I can't stay]  akai ryuusei yo  hikari michibiitekure
[hold out... your hands]  koe wo sora takaku  sakebi tsudzuketa...

I have no place to hide. can't escape

kimi ga sakebu  koe no suru hou he
[I can't stay]  akai ryuusei yo  hikari michibiitekure
[hold out... your hands]  koe wo sora takaku hanatsu
wazukana kibou daite... ima kimi no moto he yukou...
