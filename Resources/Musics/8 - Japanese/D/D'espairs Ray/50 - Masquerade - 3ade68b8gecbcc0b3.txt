MASQUERADE

Oboreru yokubou wo kazasu chou
Rasen ni mi wo yudane mushibamareta

I can't but lying!
In my head fuckin' noise
Mind will break up
bara maita uso ga kokoro wo kowashita

I wanna flake out... Flake out
Furishikiru yuutsu
Baransu wo nakushiteiku kankaku
Tenbin no you ni

Taenai nageki wo tsunagu chou
Fuhai no hane hiroge tsuiraku shita

I can't but lying!
In my head fuckin' noise
Mind will break up
Hagare ochiru kao fureru tabi kuzureta

I wanna flake out... Flake out
Kudake chiru subete ga
Shinjitsu wo kakusu yowasa hagareta
Kamen no you ni
Somewhere crying
What is "truth"?
Tell me
What is "truth"?
Liar liar
Like a masquerade

The truth is veil under the lie
On the verge of sadness
Th truth is veil under the lie
On the verge of madness now

flake out... Flake out
Furishikiru yuutsu
Baransu wo nakushiteiku kankaku
Tenbin no you ni
Somewhere crying
What is "truth"?
Tell me
What is "truth"?
Liar liar
Like a masquerade
Crying
What is "truth"?
Tell me
What is "truth"?
