CAN'T SAY GOODBYE

Try To Remember Once Again
Me wo tojite omoidasu nosa
Sora takaku kaketa hibi
Kanashimi no beeru wo muide
Mitsume aeta nakama tachi
Kono inochi hateru toki mo
Shizuka ni waraeru

Can't Say Good Bye, My Friend
Can't Say You Any More
Try To Remember
Try To Remember Once Again

Nozoma nai tatakai sae mo
Norikoeta ore tachisa
Tatoe ima hanarete ite mo
Kitto itsu ka aeru kara
Sono mune de inotte kure
Wakare no kawari ni
