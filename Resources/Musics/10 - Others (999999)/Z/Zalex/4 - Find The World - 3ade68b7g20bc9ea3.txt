FIND THE WORLD

You think that your love 
And hatred are just chemicals 
Inside your brains. 

You think that your life 
Has a meaning just to die in time 
And nothing else. 

I can understand your mood. 
But what's your plan to do? 
Why do you think that you're a grain 
Unseen and plain? 

Try listening to your soul. 
Why don't you wanna go 
Into the land you'd a dream about 
When you were a scout? 

Why don't you wanna 
The world where life is something more than you thought, 
The world where not only lies are told? 
Just open your eyes... 

Not all you've felt was a pain. 
Not all you have seen were in a mask 
That hides a real task. 

Not all you know is a lie. 
Not all you've heard were words to you 
Blaming you. 

Don't fear your own life. 
Don't make an attempt to die. 
Why do you feel like you're a grain 
Unseen and plain? 

Try listening to your soul. 
Don't fear to fall and go 
Into the land you'd a dream about 
When you were a scout. 

Don't fear to fall and you'll find the world, 
The world where life is something more than you thought, 
The world where not only lies are told. 
Relax. Send all by a fax! Live in the world...
