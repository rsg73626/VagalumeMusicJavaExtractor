FROM THE BEGINNING

Like the ants we brought the bricks 
To build our lovely home. 
The home for us, for our dreams, 
To never be alone. 
Tried to fill it with the warm, 
The warm of our hearts. 
Tried to make it so strong 
To stay forever... 

There was foundation made of 
Mutual respect. 
There were walls of understanding 
To protect our love. 
There was tenderness for us. 
It was so lovely home! 
There was everything to keep 
Our frail happiness... 

Why is it so cold for me 
To be inside near you? 
Why is it so cold for you 
To be inside near me? 
Why are we doing so 
Without any fear? 

Wish we had the strength enough 
To keep our lovely home... 
The only things we have are left for us 
By a sudden storm. 
And the pain as a reward 
Among the remains of love. 
And that breaking storm was called 
By our tiredness... 

Why is it so cold for me 
To be inside near you? 
Why is it so cold for you 
To be inside near me? 
Why are we doing so 
Without any fear? 

You could be happy with me 
If I turn to you. 
I could be happy with you 
If you turn to me. 
Why don't we try to bring 
It back by starting the feel 
Just from the beginning? 

Just from the beginning...
