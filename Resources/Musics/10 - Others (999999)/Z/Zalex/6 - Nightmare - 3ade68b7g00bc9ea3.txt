NIGHTMARE

It seems to be all right... 

Living in a locked room 
I wanna go outside. 
I can't sleep and I wish I could 
Throw it out of my mind. 

Getting closer to the understanding, 
Trying never looking back, 
Fearing that I never can 
Throw it out of my head. 

I'm prepared for disbalancement 
It seems to be all right! 
I'm prepared to be mistaken 
In everything - that's fine! 
'Cause I really wanna go 
Far away from that door. 
And nobody wanna know 
What is going on. 

Exit's locked inside my head. 
I'm trying to find it but I'm blind! 
I can't wait feeling that your help 
Will never come from the outside. 

Getting closer to the understanding. 
Every second can be last. 
Saving all my vital force 
For never giving up too fast. 

I'm prepared for disbalancement 
It seems to be all right! 
I'm prepared to be mistaken 
In everything - that's fine! 
'Cause I really wanna go 
Far away from that door. 
And nobody wanna know 
What is going on.
