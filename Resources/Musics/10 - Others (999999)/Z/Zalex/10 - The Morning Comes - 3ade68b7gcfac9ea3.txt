THE MORNING COMES

I wonder if they'll come, 
I wonder if I'll try, 
I wonder what'll be done, 
I wonder what I'll find. 

The step away from here, 
The step out of myself, 
The step without a fear, 
The step... 

The step, 
Which is not really hard, 
Which puts me into the dark, 
Which lefts my body lying on the ground... 

Oh no! 
I know it was my fault, 
I know you can complain, 
I know it can't be changed this way. 

The light is bright, 
My thoughts are clear, 
My will to die has disappeared. 
The night has gone, 
The morning comes, 
And I've got another chance. 
The light is bright, 
My thoughts are clear, 
My will to die has disappeared. 
The night has gone, 
The morning comes...
