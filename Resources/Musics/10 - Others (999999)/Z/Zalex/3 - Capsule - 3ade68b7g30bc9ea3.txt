CAPSULE

Living or dying, 
Laughing or crying, 
I do it inside... 
Giving or taking, 
Hearing or saying, 
I do it inside my 
Loneliness' capsule. 
It's like the absurd. 
The capsule where I am... 
Nobody looked in, 
Nobody got in 
The capsule where I'm alone. 

Please, break my capsule. 
Please, get inside. 
I am tired 
To be in the capsule. 
Please, get inside 
Tonight. 
Get inside 
And break my capsule. 
Please, get inside. 
I am tired 
To be in the capsule. 
Please, get inside 
Tonight. 
Get inside!
