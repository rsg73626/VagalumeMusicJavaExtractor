OUR SECRET

Every time I'm dreaming of you, 
Every time I'm lying near you, 
Every time I'm speaking to you, 
Every time I'm fooling for you 

I am there in the night 
After day, which was too bright, 
After rain, which was too cold, 
Just calm and warm, oh! 

Every time you're dreaming of me, 
Every time you're lying near me, 
Every time you're speaking to me, 
Every time you're fooling for me 

You are there in the night 
After day, which was too bright, 
After rain, which was too cold, 
Just calm and warm, oh! 

That's what we love to feel, 
Nobody knows our secret, 
When all our dreams are real, 
Nobody knows our secret. 
I live for you, my love, 
Nobody knows our secret. 

It came to us in time 
When we'd lost the hope inside 
The dreaming in the night 
Of all the days we'd left behind. 

Nobody knows our secret...
