PENDULUM

From fire to ice, 
From dark into the light, 
From left to right, 
From joy to pain inside, 
From near to far, 
From sky down to the ground, 
From day to night, 
From death back to the life. 

It's the way I feel. 
Can you feel the way I feel? 

From fire to ice... 
From day to night... 

Can you feel the way I feel?
