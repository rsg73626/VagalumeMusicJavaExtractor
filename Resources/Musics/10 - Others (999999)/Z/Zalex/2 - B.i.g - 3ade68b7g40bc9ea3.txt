B.I.G

Your hands on my face, 
I'm looking in your eyes, 
The loving embrace, 
We are flying in sky, 
We are really high... 

This dream is over, 
It's happened, we are parts. 
Love came to nowhere 
And I heard "Good bye!" 
And I said "Good bye!" 

But I will return before I am gone. 
I will return to you with love 
Before I am gone. 

I won't be near, 
I will be somewhere else. 
One day you'll see me 
In your partners face 
Spot lit by a blaze. 

You'll hear the lost words 
I hadn't chance to say, 
Feel fear of next loss 
And recall that day 
When I went away. 

So I will return before I am gone. 
I will return to you with love 
Before I am gone.
