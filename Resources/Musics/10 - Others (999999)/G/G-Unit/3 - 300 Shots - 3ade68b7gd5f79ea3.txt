300 SHOTS

[50 Cent - Verse 1] 
Y'all niggas spend too much time watchin' flicks 
Who you wanna be? Tony Montana n shit? 
Well you can start, right before his ass get hit 
So when I walk up you can see the shotgun spit 
Ferrari roof go down, Lam doors go up 
I got big boy toys, when you gon' grow up? 
Nigga knick knack pattywack, give a dog a bone 
Im still down to sell crack got a fiends home 
God bless the child with a flawless flow 
Say gave a nigga the talent to push blow 
like a pimp watch a hoe, I watch the grams go 
Watch the stash grow, straight cash flow 
im a hundred time bigger than Preme in his prime 
100 mill in my account and Im still on the grind 
When you aint in my clique, its hard to shine 
I mean talent like this is so hard to find 
G-Unit! 

[Tony Yayo - Verse 2] 
I don't dream now that i'm livin, Im out to get it 
My truck bomb kitted an AK can hit it 
Im a rap tycoon, I was fly in the whom 
So Im gettin ass like a public bathroom 
I went from Rikers Island, to shows at the garden 
Automatic startin' in the drop got your bitch pussy fartin 
My album about to drop in 7 days 
But I still poke a rapper at the VMA's 
Kilo's in a gram, PO's be my fans 
That's why I'm overseas doin shows in Japan 
I got Gats from the future, see-through guns 
So when my bullets leave the chamber I can see you run 
Nigga I flip my advance before I ran through it 
Cuz that money turn haters into that barmen fluid 
My dope be a 8, from a 1 to 10 
Keepin in a cool place from Uncle Ben 

[Muder Mase - Verse 3] 
You know you messin' with a nigga that do this for a livin' 
Put two in the street while theres two in the kitchen 
Put guns in niggaz mouth like "Who's u dissin'?" 
We give for they knew who u was missin, nigga 
You can either have a gun at the chain, or one at the brain 
I have hoes back of the church, hummin' ya name 
Even then I feel it's like cheat my men 
Watch God leave the sky to come and greet my men 
I pop niggas in the chest they never breathe again 
Route 20 in the fitness see the streets again 
Whats a man tryna wake up who cant wake up? 
Back guards face straight up with kinds of make up 
Cuz eveyrtime I run, scream, pop a 3-80 
I hear a mother scream "Please not my baby!" 
Quick as I see its you, bullets will hit you, boy 
Your nobody so no one will miss you 
Queens start to kickin' its too much to get through 
Leave a nigga leakin' like an Indian ritual 
Who wanna run up on me they get known quick 
I blackout then snatch your chrome clique 
Leavin' jail in '91, made Im homesick 
Move Pow-Fu like a Farrakhan atonement 
Raised in, caged in, let my ways spin 
Face wrapped up like a Saudi Arabian 

[Young Buck - Verse 4] 
A country nigga still lookin' for a New York hoe 
About to kill these niggas with this New York flow 
Say one nigga name homie you gon' go 
You in that Hot97 so New York know 
I use to listen to Jada I've never listened to Joe 
I couldnt tell ya how now one of his verses go 
Seen Styles and Sheek out, doin promo 
I was like "What Up?" and they was like "Uh-Oh!" 
I aint just get cold, see my block been hot 
50 give me the word, niggas would have been pop 
Fuck a interview nigga I get into you nigga 
Enough hearin' 'bout what you finna do nigga 

[Prodigy - Verse 5] 
Murder at its best, this is rap at its finest 
You can see my verse, even if you the blindest 
My raps is vivid, ya bitch I hit it 
All ready, yeah that's right this is spaghetti 
Head mob niggas, my gun bomb niggas 
Go 'head and shoot, my pistol nuke niggas 
When I let off the whole Earth feel the effects 
I mix CD's and treat 'em like album shit 
Our albums, we treat 'em like the president elections 
On our champagne campaign livin' up dresses 
On the dance flo' the Hennessee it flow 
When you fuck with G-Unit then you gon' fuckin' blow 
When you fuck with Mobb Deep, then bring some fuckin' hoes 
Cuz its a gang of us and we ready to go 
Cuz after the party after the party we get so drunk 
We forget all about the next day hun 

[Havoc - Verse 6] 
Get it teflon don, AK-filled 
Get your mouth blown off like the hand that feeds you 
Yeah little motherfucker put the hammer in diesel 
G-Unit Game Over this is only a preview 
Niggas shittin' on theyself gotta rock in the huggy 
The coke in the pot rise to the top like dougy 
Got chicks with a ass like Buffy, yes homie trust me 
Plays fuck me, kick 'em out when they try to get touchy 
QB/Southside, if you wanted to Trestle 
Man your man is hot, you dont wanna get next to 
Like 50's beef is mine and mine is his 
See this serious, motherfuckin ask them kids 
Niggas wild on the streets, scared to death to bid 
Sell anything that stay from the bottles and cuffs, nigga butt 

[Billy Danze - Verse 7] 
You about to witness an M.O.P thug out 
And for you niggas hatin' listen to the sounds of the Unit kiss my ass with your tongue out, nigga 
Fuck a warden I ring bells like a doorman 
So all you motherfuckers take it easy like sunday mornin (Get 'em up!) 
Put 'em up, wrap ya hand or knuckle up 
Ground zero we never ran never will we fuck 'em up 
Dude you gonna get your ass banged fuckin' with that homie Lloyd Banks 
Wild gun style what the fuck y'all think.. 

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 8] 
Niggas aint got nuttin' on me, everybody know that 
Niggas run up on a V, everybody gon' clap 
And if he aint what he say, n everybody gon rats 
Just rat, and catch your little body all rats 
Matter'fact, I dont hang out with no lobby for rats (Nah) 
The gun swallow me back off Bacardi and Yack 
Im in the club with the snub, this the part of the track 
A stray from the K will take a part of ya hat 
Im gettin cake like you wouldnt believe but im accepted 
By mainstream America and good in the piece 
Now niggaz wanna talk all greasy (why) 
Like they aint used to open up for me in New York on tv (Ya know) 
Skip all chatter, and walk off Eazy 
A milly will make your body looker look all measly 
Ya bitch spotted me on the dolo and Im low-low 
Damn near broke a monolo for a photo 
I aint ridin' around with a Dodo that's a No-No 
Momma taught me better than that you go to go home 
Look at me now, a product of poverty 
I cant watch the way I gotta decide a me 
The 'hoods fulla hurt but that was a robbery 
Critics owe me an apologee, Im probably 
A sixteen away from the lottery 
My niggas keep guns, thats one of the things I gotta be 
Im wrapped up in a dome shit, cause nigga got all kinds of beef they want ya to come get 
Im 2 steppin' with my weapon, cause they dont check 'em up 
I know niggas from 'round there and they dont check us 
All of the niggas was fans when I met 'em, just waitin' in the wind for niggas to come and get 'em 
On my next album, Im'a have some fun wit' 'em, spank 'em all around so everybody forget 'em 
They Envy, cause I got the 'hood in a frenzy 
And I move smooth with the wooden Benzy 
Blend in, niggas will body ya for a pen 
Baby need food, baby momma need fin 
You know me, New York cap on 
Batman whip that I got off a rap song 
Im the fan with the illegal strap on 
Teflon n a wife beater n black on 
Its on! 

[50 Cent talking..] 
Wassup? this the kid 50 Cent man 
Its going down, ya heard me? 
Niggas got me mad, ya talk, ya niggas got me all fucked up.. 
Im finna kill few of you mother fuckers man.. 
Know what Im sayin'? Watch ya niggas say somethin' smart out ya mouth, boy 
You better stop usin' ya mouth, before I help you NOT be able to use ya mouth Mother fucker!
