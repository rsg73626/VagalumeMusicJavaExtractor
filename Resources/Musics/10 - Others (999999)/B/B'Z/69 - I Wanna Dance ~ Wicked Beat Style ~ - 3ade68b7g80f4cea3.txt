I WANNA DANCE ~ WICKED BEAT STYLE ~

Crush! Crush! Taxi on a busy neon street
Give me baby, just a little smile if you can
I know, I cannot kill your serious pain of broken heart
But I can dance with you till the break of day
Do what you really wanna do and let me be your man

Odoritai Kimi no naka de
Make it together ain't no lookin' back
Nothing can stop us, give me a chance, through the night

Dance, dance alone now, keeping your heart on the funky steps
But, you come and share the weight, girl, if you want
Now I feel like you're going away with broken heart
Get something to tell you and I don't wanna lose you
Be what you really wanna be and let me be your man

Odoritai Kimi no naka de
Make it together ain't lookin' back
Nothing can stop us, give me a chance, through the night

Itsuka Odoritai Kimi no nake de
Shake it together time is on your side
Nothing can stop us, dance as you like, come anytime

Odoritai Kimi no naka de
Make it together ain't lookin' back
Nothing can stop us, give me a chance, through the night
Itsuka Odoritai Kimi no nake de
Shake it together time is on your side
Nothing can stop us, dance as you like, come anytime

Itsuka Odoritai Kimi no nake de
Shake it together time is on your side
Nothing can stop us, dance as you like, come anytime
