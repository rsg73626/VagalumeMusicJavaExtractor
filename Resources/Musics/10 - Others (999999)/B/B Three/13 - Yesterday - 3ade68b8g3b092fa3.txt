YESTERDAY

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
Oh, I believe in yesterday. 

Suddenly, I'm not half the woman I used to be, 
There's a shadow hanging over me. 
Oh, yesterday came suddenly. 

Why he had to go I don't know he wouldn't say. 
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday. 

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play. 
Now I need a place to hide away. 
Oh, I believe in yesterday. 

Mm mm mm mm mm
