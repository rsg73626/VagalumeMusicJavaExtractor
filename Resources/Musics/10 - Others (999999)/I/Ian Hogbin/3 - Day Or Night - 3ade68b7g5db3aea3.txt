DAY OR NIGHT

Need to get out
Need to dance
Wanna feel the bass pump
Wanna see the strobing lights
Wanna feel the heat
Wanna use all my energy
Chorus:
Need a body
Not anybody
Day or night
Need a body
Not anybody
Day or night
Freakin' all night & day
Doin' it right
Makin' it throb
Feelin' alright
Seein' moonlight
Stream thru the one window in the room
Chorus x3
