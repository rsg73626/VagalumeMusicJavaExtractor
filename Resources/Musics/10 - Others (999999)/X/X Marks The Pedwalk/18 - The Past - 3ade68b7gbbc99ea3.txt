THE PAST

It's behind you it's lurking
To leap against you
Not a monster memories
Live much longer
A paralyzed heart
Full of pain and full of sorrow
Could end today and never end tomorrow


I've got to rest next it's the past
That keeps me waiting for a vague time
Need a kick sick what's the trick
To light reasons and to move out of the gap
I'm trapped in a sad head
And I gad about the past
What's the name of my retreat
Invisible strenght
Inane insane can't chop up the chain
The background so far and I'm falling again


The past is a mystery
Hard to forget and easy to kill
It's not like history
The page of a book
I could rend when I look
