W.I.T.I.A.K

I'm sitting down all around
Is still insignificance
I feel like moving in a swap
I draw a deep breath and get around to meditate
What do I miss
I intend to cover this
But all my mind is close to this
What I taste is a kiss


You are still flying your way around
It comes to my mind to blow
Your hair sentimental aside
Don't move time is now out of light
