TURN OF THE TIDE

Ebb tide flow
It's a natural might
Rules my day and night
And the way to go


Realize
When the waves com in
Passing times and lands
To leave steps in life


Atmospheres
And expecting quiet
Like a divine voice
It holds life rhythm tight


It's not in sight
But it covers your mind
It's a leading light
You'll never hide


It's the turn of the tide
