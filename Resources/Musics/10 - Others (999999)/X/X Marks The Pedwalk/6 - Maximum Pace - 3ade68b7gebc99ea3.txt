MAXIMUM PACE

Like a crash and attacks
I feel the fidget in me
It's erratic and rash
I'm a ravin of time
And the reason's under me
Achieving maximum pace
My view on every side
Can't stop this floating might
I control every side
Get going no way is too far
It's like a bash
It's erratic and rash


There's no reason to stop running here
There's no reason to blow out
All the flames that keep my mind in heat
I follow time to extend my dreams
