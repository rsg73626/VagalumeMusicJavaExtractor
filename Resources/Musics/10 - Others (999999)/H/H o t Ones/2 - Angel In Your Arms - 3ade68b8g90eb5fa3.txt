ANGEL IN YOUR ARMS

Do you think I'm such a fool,
To believe everything you say is true?
That just goes to show,
that you really don't know.

While you're out painting the town,
do you think I'm home, just sitting around?
Waiting on you.
Now, who's really the fool.

When I first found out, I hurt all over.
I felt so left out, 'til I got to know her.
So I tried to wait 'til she got over.
And I became just like her, so don't be surprised to find.

That the angel in your arms this morning,
is gonna be the devil is someone else's arms tonight.

Yes,the angel in your arms this morning,
is gonna be the devil is someone else's arms tonight.

Why'd you slip around secretly,
if you were tired of loving me?
Why'd you keep holding on,
When love was already gone?

At times you said, you weren't feeling well.
Did you think I couldn't tell,
you'd been with someone else?
You were only kidding yourself.

When I first found out, I hurt all over.
I felt so left out, 'til I got to know her.
So I tried to wait as she got over.
And I became just like her, so don't be surprised to find.

That the angel in your arms this morning,
is gonna be the devil is someone else's arms tonight.

Yes,the angel in your arms this morning,
is gonna be the devil is someone else's arms tonight.

Yes,the angel in your arms this morning,
is gonna be the devil is someone else's arms tonight.
