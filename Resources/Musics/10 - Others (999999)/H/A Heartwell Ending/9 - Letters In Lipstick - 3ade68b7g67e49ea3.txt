LETTERS IN LIPSTICK

Looking out my bedroom window
Finding hope and constant lies
Tried my hardest to just cut these strings,
These strings that hold me back

I dont know just what he tells you
But to me it sounds like a lie
Following letters,
Following letters in lipstick
It seems to me you're running out,
Running out...

Sitting, waiting for your phone call
What's the point when you're not here
I dont know why you make me feel this way
But still im falling faster

I dont know just what he tells you
But to me it sounds like a lie
Following letters,
Following letters in lipstick
It seems to me you're running out,
Running out of time

I've heard a voice of constant interest
Telling me to run and get you
I fell no need
You need to fall this time
You need to fall this...

I dont know just what he tells you
But to me it sounds like a lie
Following letters,
Following letters in lipstick
It seems to me you're running out,
Running out of time

Keeping the letters written it lipstick
Cant believe everythings happened to me at the Same time
Im running out, Running out of time
