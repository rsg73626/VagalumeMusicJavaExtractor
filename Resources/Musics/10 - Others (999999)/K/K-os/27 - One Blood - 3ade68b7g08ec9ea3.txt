ONE BLOOD

Yo, jig it out

Verse 1

Liquor shot, this is Hip-Hop, if I move to the east it still won't cease
So yo I don't stop
You get dropped by sonic waves caught in the maze ancient days
Heart of a lion fire ablaze 'cause

*Chorus x2*

This is homicide
Useless homicide
This is homicide
Useless homicide
This is homicide
Useless homicide
This is homicide
