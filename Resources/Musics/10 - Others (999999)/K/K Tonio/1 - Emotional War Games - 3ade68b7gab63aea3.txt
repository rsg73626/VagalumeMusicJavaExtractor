EMOTIONAL WAR GAMES

She says she loves me
But she's hurting so bad
She can't seem to trust me
She's been hurt so bad in the past
So she tries to control me
Keep me in chains
Cause she's so afraid
I won't come back again

Honey stop
These emotional war games
Stop
In the name of love
Stop
Before everybody loses

Stop

The battle rages
Day after day
No one escapes it
And no place is safe
Because just one false move
And the shooting starts
Just one wrong move
And we fall apart

Is this the tunnel of love
Is it a poison chamber
Is it a gift from above
Or are we in some kind of danger

Lord teach me patience
Show me a way
Teach us forgiveness
Before it's too late
Because i want my baby
And she wants me too
But if we don't stop fighting
Looks like we're all through
