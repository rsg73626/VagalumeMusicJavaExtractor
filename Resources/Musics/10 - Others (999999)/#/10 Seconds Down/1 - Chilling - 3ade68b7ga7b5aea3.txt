CHILLING

We aint going out like that tonight
Or do you wanna put up a fight
Oh yeah I'll fight for it, I aint putting up with this
From now on you'll listen to me
That is the way it's gonna be
'Cause I'm gonna win from you, yeah I ain't afraid of you
"What do you say?"
I'm gonna fuck you up
I'm gonna tear you apart
I ain't taking shit from you, yeah I'm gonna beat you
"What do you say?"
Fuck you, I'm gonna break you
'Cause you won't make it through, I might even kill you too
But I'm just chilling

You can better grow some wings
Or fly without those things
Oh yeah I'll fight for it, I ain't putting up with this
"What do you say?"
I'm gonna fuck you up, I'm gonna tear you apart
'Cause I'm gonna win from you, yeah I ain't afraid of you
Can't stop now take me away, to a fine place where I can stay

T.S.D. sound
It's coming from all around
By the time we're through you'll see
'Cause I'm kicking ass with my man yo E.
Better watch your back when he's around
Or else your ass might never be found
Don't ask him what he's gonna do
That's about the time when he says fuck you
I'm just chilling
