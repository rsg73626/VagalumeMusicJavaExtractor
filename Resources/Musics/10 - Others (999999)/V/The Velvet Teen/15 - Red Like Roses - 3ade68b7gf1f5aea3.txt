RED LIKE ROSES

each night i close my eyes and wonder what will come of me in days to follow
i lay awake and after countless hours, i just can't think straight
turn in, fade, pass out
yet, in this simple way, we offer
to destroy all we can't figure out
in our simple lives, unconscious
we employ our skills from underground
to seek what we've never seen
to explore, deep inside
the mornings greet me with grey days and tear-stained windowsills and pillowcases
i get dressed and go to work
bloody noses, red like roses pose as sanctuary
when i just need a minute to myself
and in this simple way, we offer
to destroy all we can't figure out
in our simple lives, unconscious
we employ our skills from underground
to seek what we've never seen
to find, where we never knew
to explore deep, inside
kill me, won't you kill me
kill me
let me sleep again
kill me
don't relate your memories
kill me
kill me won't you
to see
what we've never seen to find
where we never knew to go
where we never dared to explore
deep...
