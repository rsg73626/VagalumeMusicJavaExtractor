ALL SHE'S SAYING

There's a girl begging in the street
For a dollar and a dream
I think she's only seventeen
Her eyes are wet
Her lips are dry
As she steps close by
And she holds her hands to the sky

All she's saying
Is 'baby, take a look at me'
All she's asking
Is 'honey, won't you rescue me?'
All she's saying
Is 'baby, take a piece of my love'
'come on, take a piece of me now'

The other day i saw her playing
On k-mart's parking
A one-string violin
She plays a song that no-one knows
No-one seems to care
Old soldiers never die

All she's saying
Is 'baby, take a look at me'
All she's asking
Is 'honey, won't you rescue me?'
All she's saying
Is 'baby, take a piece of my love'
'come on, take a piece of me now'

And i wonder where she's been
There is nothing she hasn't seen
And i wonder what has she done
She's always on the run

All she's saying
Is baby, take a look at me'
All she's asking
Is 'honey, won't you rescue me?'
All she's saying
Is 'baby, take a piece of my love'
