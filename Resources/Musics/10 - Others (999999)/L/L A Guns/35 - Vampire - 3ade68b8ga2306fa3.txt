VAMPIRE

I been a vampire for 14 years
I been around the world
I heard it with my ears
Walking down the Sunset strip
Cast no shadow at The Whisky
At the Rainbow getting lit

Shot off some guns at night
Out there in those Hollywood skies
Shot off my guns so many times
Shot off some guns at night
Out there in those Hollywood skies
Shot off my guns so many times

Cocked and loaded with my fangs I grip
The world for a while as it takes me on my trip
Flying high never coming down
Only come out at night when the crazy shit goes down

Shot off some guns at night
Out there in those Hollywood skies
Shot off my guns so many times
Shot off some guns at night
Out there in those Hollywood skies
Shot off my guns so many times

I woke from the dead
And this is what I said
I'm gonna rip and tear
Off their heads
Walking round this city so many times
I had the best women I drank the best wines

Shot off some guns at night
Out there in those Hollywood skies
Shot off my guns so many times
Shot off some guns at night
Out there in those Hollywood skies
Shot off my guns so many times
