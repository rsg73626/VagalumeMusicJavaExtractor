ENJOY YOURSELF

*chorus*
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself

*verse 1*
You sittin' over there
Starin' into space
While people are dancin'
Dancin' all over the place

You shouldn't worry
About the things you can't control
Come on baby while the night is young
Why won't you let yourself, let yourself go

*chorus*

*verse 2*
Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time you and me
Sittin' there with your mouth poked out
Just as sweet as you can be

Why don't you live
Live the life you got
Come on baby, let's get it
While the music's runnin' hot

*chorus*

You know I've, I've been watchin' you
I can wipe away that frown
Oh, you and I can get together
We can tear the house down
We can tear the house down
We can tear the whole house down

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
You better enjoy yourself
You got to enjoy yourself
Say it again

[Enjoy yourself] Enjoy yourself
[Get down, get down] Just get on down
[Enjoy yourself] Enjoy yourself
[Get down, get down] Just get on down
[Enjoy yourself] Enjoy yourself
[Get down, get down] Just get on down
[Enjoy yourself] Enjoy yourself
[Get down, get down] Just get on down

[Come on] Come on
[Come on] Come on
[Come on] Come on [Come on]
You can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it
Hey, hey, hey get on down

[Enjoy yourself] Enjoy yourself
[Get down, get down] Just get on down
