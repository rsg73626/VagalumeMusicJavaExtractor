SOMEWHERE

Somewhere,
There's gonna be a place for us
Somewhere
When the worlds looking down,
Look what we found
Somewhere,
There's gonna be love enough
Well i know that you're there
Somewhere out there
Somewhere

We walking on ice,
We throwing the dice
Don't let me down
It's up to you and me
It's our destiny
We can make it right,
Yeah, we gotta hold on tight

What can i do, what can i say,
Does it have to be this way
What can i do, what can i say,
Does it have to be this way.

{refrain:}
Somewhere,
There's gonna be a place for us
Somewhere
When the worlds looking down,
Look what we found
Somewhere,
There's gonna be love enough
Well i know that you're there
Somewhere out there

I'd walk a thousand miles
A thousand times,
Just to be with you, yeah,
You know it's true
I'll give my heart and soul,
Everything i own
Just to see you smile
Just to stay a while

What can i do, what can i say,
Does it have to be this way
What can i do, what can i say,
Does it have to be this way.

{au refrain}
