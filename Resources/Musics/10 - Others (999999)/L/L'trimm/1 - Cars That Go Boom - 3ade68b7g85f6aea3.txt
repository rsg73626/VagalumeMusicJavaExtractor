CARS THAT GO BOOM

How many kinds, where can we start?
Yeah
I like the ones with the pretty eyes,
Well i like all kinds of guys.
Stop. what happened, how about the ones we especially like?
Which ones?
You know the ones with the cars that go..
I hear you..
Hit it!

It was me and the possy with bunny (g)
We were cruising in the jag or the lambourgini,
When low and behold there appeared a mirage,
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage.
We stopped short, did a double take,
He was looking so fly, i thought i wasn't awake.
He was obviously hooking up bass, i asume,
But then he turned a little button and the car went boom.

We like the cars, the cars that go boom,
We're tigre and bunny and we like the boom.
We like the cars, the cars that go boom.
We're tigre and bunny and we like the boom.

We like them short, and we like them tall,
We like them one, and we like them all.
They're always adding speakers when they find the room,
Coz they know we like the guys with the cars that go boom.
And see my boyfriend really knows where it's at,
He's got 50 inch woofers all along the back.
He makes a comment on going to my room,
I'd rather stay out with his car that goes boom.

We like the cars, the cars that go boom,
We're tigre and bunny and we like the boom.
We like the cars, the cars that go boom.
We're tigre and bunny and we like the boom.

Now if your car ain't got it, go out and get it,
We like the boom and don't you forget it.
So turn down the treble, and flaunt your bass,
So your car can be heard almost any place.
Coz when you're in the street you can't go far,
Without hearing the boom pouring out your car.
So if your speaker's weak, then please turn it off,
Coz we like the cars that sound so tough.

We like the cars, the cars that go boom,
We're tigre and bunny and we like the boom.
We like the cars, the cars that go boom.
We're tigre and bunny and we like the boom.

Everybody just beep your horn
Everybody just beep your horn at us,
Now clap!
Hit it!
Beep, beep beep beep beep!
Come on everybody!
Hey, hey hey hey hey!
Beep, beep beep beep beep!
