Go back (Oh Baby) ye~ Why did you want a break up if
you can’t even keep your word?
Again (no no ye) Promise me that you’ll never try to
find me again
I won’t go back…I’ve forgotten you this much
If I see you now I will fall again
Why are trying to find me?
The day that you left me so coldly are still in my
memories 

*I yearn for you
I erased you through my tears
In the days I threw away the memories were slowly
going away
I didn’t want the remaining love I had for you
Even if I felt you I didn’t want to get hurt
After I let you go this is what I wished for
I want to forget your love 

Love is pain Pain is love Love is sorrow
Sorrow is love Love is life Life is love 

I don’t regret it
Even though it has become a painful memory
Because you were a person I loved more than anyone
else 

*Repeat (For me)
Please don’t find me again
Now I have tried to forget you
Still I yearn for you
Do you hope for me to still hurt for you?
