I'M FOREVER BLOWING BUBBLES

I'm dreaming dreams, 
I'm scheming schemes, I'm building castles high. 
They're born anew, their days are few, 
Just like a sweet butterfly. 
And as the daylight is dawning, 
They come again in the morning! 

I'm forever blowing bubbles,
Pretty bubbles in the air,
They fly so high,
Nearly reach the sky,
Then like my dreams
They fade and die.
Fortune's always hiding,
I've looked everywhere,
I'm forever blowing bubbles,
Pretty bubbles in the air.
When shadows creep, 
When I'm asleep, 
To lands of hope I stray! 

Then at daybreak, 
When I awake, 
My bluebird flutters away.. 
"Happiness, you seem so near me, 
Happiness, come forth and cheer me!" 

I'm forever blowing bubbles,
Pretty bubbles in the air,
They fly so high,
Nearly reach the sky,
Then like my dreams
They fade and die.
Fortune's always hiding,
I've looked everywhere,
I'm forever blowing bubbles,
Pretty bubbles in the air.
