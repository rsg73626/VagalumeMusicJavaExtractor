CELEBRITY KILLER

For anyone who looked at me,
I want to keep it straight,
That's all that keeps my fingers out,
When I don't look so great.

Don't get yourself killed today,
Celebrity killer yeah.

For anyone who'd talk with me,
What would you have me say?
Let's talk about America,
Let's talk about L.A.

Don't get yourself killed today,
Celebrity killer yeah.

For anyone who'd go with me,
I want to keep it straight,
For anyone who'd look to me,
Hell, I don't look so great.

Don't get yourself killed today,
Celebrity killer yeah.
Don't get yourself killed today
Celebrity killer, hey
