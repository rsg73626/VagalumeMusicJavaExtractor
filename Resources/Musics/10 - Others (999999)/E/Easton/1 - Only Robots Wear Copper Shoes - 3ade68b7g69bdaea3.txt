ONLY ROBOTS WEAR COPPER SHOES

She closes her eyes, when she dreams my name at night
It makes her days
It makes her days go by with the thought of me on her mind
Her eyes lit up like shooting stars that reached her smile
She is the light that brightens up my skies

Say my name
As a lullaby
I need you hear
To light up my skies

If i get lost, i'll just think of your smile
If i get lost, i'll just think of your smile to find my way, to find my way back home

You showed me the ways to make black light up the place
How can i see if you're not here with me?

Why does time try, to pass us by, with it's moving speeds?
Try not to move
Try not to move
And i'll just meet you there

Say my name
As a lullaby
I need you here
To light up my skies
Just light up my skies

You showed me the ways to make black light up the place
How can i see if you're not here with me?

You showed me the ways to make black light up the place
How can i see if you're not here with me?

If i get lost, i'll just think of your smile
If i get lost, i'll just think of your smile
If i get lost, i'll just think of your smile
