WHISKY BOTTLE BLUES

I have no home, ain't got no money
All that I have is my honey
All night long she's a talker
All night long I adore her

Ch:
Whiskey bottle blues
I feel happy in my shoes
Whisky bottle blues


Skin so smooth, lips of fire
Love her so, she's my desire
Mouth to mouth, always together
She's my dear, we are forever
