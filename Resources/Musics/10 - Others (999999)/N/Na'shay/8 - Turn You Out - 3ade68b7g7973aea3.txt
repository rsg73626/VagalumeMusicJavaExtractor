TURN YOU OUT

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Gonna turn you out (yeah)
gonna turn you out

[Verse 1]
I know you gotta girl
and i got a man
and i know she ain't lovin you the way i can
you and me got somethin special
that they don't know about
we seen each other twice
and we talk on the phone all night
while i wait and doin this right
so while they keep trippin
our love will be slippin
in their place singin Na'Shay

[Chorus 4x]
Gonna turn you out
make you scream out loud
show you what it's all about
baby let me show you how

[Verse 2]
I wanna be with you
can't keep it on the low
we gotta let em know
come pick me up
and don't be late (don't be late)
cuz i don't think
that i can wait
i know my man ain't true
and as soon as he comes
i'll tell him what he can do
i just wanna be with you boy

[Chorus 4x]
Gonna turn you out
make you scream out loud
show you what it's all about
baby let me show you how

[Bridge]
I know you gotta girl
and i gotta man
can't keep it on the low
we gotta let em know
come pick me up
and don't be late
we got somethin special
that they don't know about

[Chorus til fade]
Gonna turn you out
make you scream out loud
show you what it's all about
baby let me show you how
