MY MAMA AIN'T HOME

He loves me, he loves me not (mmmmmmmmm)
he loves me, he loves me not (mmmmmmmmm)

[Verse 1]
My mother called
she said that she
wouldn't be comin home till late
but if she knew
about us two
she sho nuff be on her way

[Hook]
Girl i think it's time for you to break em down and kick it with me
(i don't know if i should)
or maybe i can come over and we can watch a little T.V.
(i don't think we would)

[Chorus]
Sittin at home
thinkin by the phone
wishin you were here cuz my mama ain't home

thinkin by the phone
wishin you were here cuz my mama ain't home

[Verse 2]
What would we do, what would we do
if i let you into my room?
(where do we go from here?)
should i listen to my mama
sayin about havin you come on over
when she ain't here

[Hook]
Your mama just trippin cuz she know i wanna be your man
(she don't even know you that well)
well while we are not around her she gon have to understand
just make sure you don't kiss and tell

[Chorus]
