SMILE

Whatever
smile, smile, smile, smile

[Verse 1]
Somethin bout the way
that you look at me
tell me, i gotta know
what it is you see
i'm wonderin could it be
that you feel the same
do you get butterflies at the mention of my name

[Bridge]
If you don't 
well i do
i get this feeling when your near me
what is it about you
it's got me trippin
so you don't hear me
you say that it's mutual
do you feel me
yes, no, maybe
this is more than a crush
i think it's serious

[Chorus]
What is it that you do
that's got me into you
boy you make me
smile, smile, smile, smile
whatever could it be
that's got me this way
boy you make me
smile, smile, smile, smile

[Verse 2]
Somethin bout the way
that you talk to me
don't know, can't explain
what you do to me
i find myself in a daze
when i think of you
though you may deny
somethin says you feel it to

[Chorus]
(what could it be)
what could it be
(are you feelin me)
are you feelin me
(am i worth your while)
am i worth your while
boy you make me smile

[Chorus til fade]
