MY GETAWAY

[Kids in background talking and counting]
Here we go y'all uh
Follow me y'all
Let's go y'all
My getaway, my getaway
Come on uh, come on

1 - Do you want to play outside?
And come with me it's such a lovely day
I want to go and play
Wanna come with me on my getaway

Repeat 1

When you don't know what to do
Go play and have some fun
Gotta find a place to go
Just you and me alone with no one
Somewhere when skies are blue
With Cher and Sonny too
Let's go on an escapade
Just follow me and I'll lead the way

Repeat 1 (2x)

We can have a barbecue
Have cake and candy too
Pretend it's a holiday
Your day, my day, his day, and her day
This is a special way
To make you feel okay
Any place you want to go
Enjoy yourself with the best of your day

Repeat 1 (2x)

Repeat 1 faded and blurred

Here we go y'all
[Kids in background]
Do you wanna?

Repeat 1 till end
