TOUCH MYSELF

Oh, oh I, oh I 
Oh, oh I, oh I 
Verse 1

When you're alone what you do is what you do 
I'm not scared to say 
When you're alone don't you ever get confused 
Ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good baby 
Chorus 1

I won't be afraid to touch myself 
It's all right 
I said it's all right 
I don't think it's wrong to touch yourself 
Ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good 
Chrous 2-

Every night I get away 
And I think about it baby 
You are on my mind 
I ain't afraid to touch myself 
I don't need nobody else 
It's you baby, it's you baby 
Verse 2

When you're alone what you need is what you need 
One time ecstasy 
People say it's not the thing to do 
But that's the safest way to making it feel good 
Hey I

Oh, oh I, oh I 
I don't need nobody baby 
I don't need nobody baby 
I don't need nobody baby
