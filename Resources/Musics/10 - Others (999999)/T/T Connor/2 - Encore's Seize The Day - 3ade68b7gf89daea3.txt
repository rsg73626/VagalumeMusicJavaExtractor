ENCORE'S SEIZE THE DAY

Open the gates and seize the day
Don't be afraid and don't delay
Nothing can break us,
No one can make us,
Give our rights away,
Arise and swize the...day.

Now is the time to seize the day,
(echo repeat)
Send out the call ang join the fray,
(echo repeat)
Wrongs will be righted,
If we're united,
Let us seize the day.

Neighbor to neighbor,
Father to son,
One for all and all for one.

Open the gates and seize the day,
(echo repeat)
Don't be afraid and don't delay,
(echo repeat)
Nothing can break us,
No one can make us,
Give our rights away.

Neighbor to neighbor,
Father to son,
One for all and all for one.

Neighbor to neighbor,
Father to son,
One for all and all for one.

One for all and all for... one!
