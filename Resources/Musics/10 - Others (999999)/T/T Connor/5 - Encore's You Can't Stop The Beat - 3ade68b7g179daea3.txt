ENCORE'S YOU CAN'T STOP THE BEAT

You cant stop an avalanche 
As it races down the hill 
You can try to stop the seasons, girl
But ya know you never will 
And you can try to stop my dancin' feet

But i just cannot stand still 
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round 
And my heart's keeping time 
To the speed of sound 
I was lost til i heard the drums 
Then i found my way

'Cause you can't stop the beat

Ever since this old world began 
A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man 
And so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it 
The best that i can today

'Cause you cant stop 
The motion of the ocean 
Or the sun in the sky 
You can wonder if you wanna 
But i never ask why

And if you try to hold me down 
I'm gonna spit in your eye and say 
That you cant stop the beat!

What do ya' have to say, Penny?

I am now a checkerboard chick! 
You can't stop a river 
As it rushes to the sea 
You can try and stop the hands of time
But ya know it just can't be 
And if they try to stop us, seaweed, 
I'll call the n - double-a - n - p!
'Cause the world keeps spinning 
'Round and 'round.

'Round and 'round

And my heart's keeping time 
To the speed of sound

Speed of sound

I was lost till i heard the drums 
Then i found my way

'Cause you can't stop the beat

Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman liked to shake it
On a saturday night 
And so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it 
With all my might today
'Cause you cant stop 
The motion of the ocean 
Or the rain from above 
They can try to stop the paradise
We're dreaming of 
But they cannot stop the rhythm 
Of two hearts in love to stay 
'Cause you cant stop the beat!

Tracy, I have a little something
I'd like to add, if you don't mind.
You cant stop my happiness 
'Cause i like the way i am 
And you just can't stop my knife and fork 
When i see a christmas ham 
So if you don't like the way i look 
Well, i |ust don't give a damn!

'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round 
And my heart's keeping time 
To the speed of sound 
I was lost til i heard the drums 
Then i found my way

'Cause you cant stop the beat

Ever since this old world began 
A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man 
And so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it 
The best that i can today

'Cause you cant stop
The motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna
But i never ask why
And if you try to hold me down 
I'm gonna spit in your eye and say 
That you cant stop the beat!

Wilbur, be a dear and get me my 
oxygen... NOW!

Step aside, Miss Buttercup... it's 
time to wrap this mutha' up! 
Oh, oh, oh, 
You can't stop today

...No!

As it comes speeding down the track

Oîi îîi îîi, child, yes

Child, yesterday is hist'ry

Be gone!

And it's never coming back

Look ahead

'Cause tomorrow is a brand new day

And it don't know white from black

Yeah!

'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round 
And my heart's keeping time 
To the speed of sound 
I was lost til i heard the drums 
Then i found my way 
'Cause you cant stop the beat

Ever since we first saw the light 
A man and woman liked to shake it
On a saturday night 
And so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it 
With all my might today
'Cause you can't stop 
The motion of the ocean 
Or the rain from above 
They can try to stop ths paradise
We're dreaming of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay 
You can't stop the beat!

Aah, aah, aah 
Aah, aah, aah 
Aah, aah, aah

Come on, you von tussles 
Go on, shake your fanny muscles

We can't!

Yes, you can!

No, we can't!

Yes, you can!

You can't stop the beat

Ever since we first saw the sun 
It seems von tussle girls are always
Tryin' to please someone 
But now we're gonna shake and shimmy it 
And have some fun 
Today!

'Cause you can't stop 
The motion of the ocean 
Or the rain from above 
They can try to stop the paradise
We're dreaming of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay 
'Cause you can't stop the beat!
You can't stop the beat!! 
You can't stop the beat!!!
