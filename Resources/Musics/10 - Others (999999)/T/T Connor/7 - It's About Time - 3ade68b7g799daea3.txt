IT'S ABOUT TIME

So you say you wanna stay at home
Another night in your comfort zone
I know it’s easy to get caught up in the same routine
So many things that you avoid
But you don’t have to be paranoid
Your heart says go but you’re in limbo somewhere in between
You’re always talking but it’s getting you nowhere
Take the first step and it might just take you there, yeah
It's about time
You got your feet wet
It's about time
You took a dive in the deep end
Been a long time
You don't need a reason
Give it up get it out
Do what you believe in
It's about time
You got a little crazy
It's about time
So jump in, maybe
Been a long time
Waiting on the sidelines
Live it up let it out
Maybe it's about time
You watch your exercise videos
While you down a bag of Oreos
You say you want to start tomorrow
That was yesterday
It’s time to go, so don’t be late
It’s easy to procrastinate
The same excuses that you always use
Sound really lame
You are the only thing that’s holdin' yourself back
If you keep waiting you might miss another chance
Yeah!
It's about time
You got your feet wet
It's about time
You took a dive in the deep end
Been a long time
You don't need a reason
Give it up get it out
Do what you believe in
It's about time
You got a little crazy
It's about time
So jump in maybe
Been a long time
Waiting on the sidelines
Live it up let it out
Maybe, it's about time
Let’s live for this moment
‘Cause who knows what tomorrow will bring
The road is wide open
And right here right now
Turn it around! Don’t let your life pass you by
It's about time
You got your feet wet
It's about time
You took a dive in the deep end
Been a long time
You don't need a reason
Give it up get it out
Do what you believe in
It's about time
You got a little crazy
It's about time
So jump in, maybe
Been a long time
Waiting on the sidelines
Live it up let it out
Maybe it's about time
Gotta get your feet wet
Take a dive in the deep end
You don't need a reason
Do what you believe in
You gotta get a little crazy
Jump in, maybe!
Live it up let it out
Give it up get it out
Been a long time
Been a long time
Been a long time
You gotta get a little crazy
So jump in maybe
It's about time!
