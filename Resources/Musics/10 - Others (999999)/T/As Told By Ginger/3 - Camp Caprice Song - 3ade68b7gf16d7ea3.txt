CAMP CAPRICE SONG

At Camp Caprice, price, price 
We don't say "mooses", we say "meece"
And we feel proud, proud, proud
So we sing our song aloud 

And every morning, morning, morning
As a new day's dawning, dawning
We are proud, proud, proud
So we sing our song aloud

We come in peace, peace, peace
We're the girls of Camp Caprice
We are proud, proud, proud
So we sing our song aloud
