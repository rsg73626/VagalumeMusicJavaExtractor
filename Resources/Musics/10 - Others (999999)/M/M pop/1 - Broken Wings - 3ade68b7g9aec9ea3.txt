BROKEN WINGS

Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands
This time might be the last I fear
Unless I make it all too clear
I need you so
Oh, oh

Refr√£o
Take these Broken Wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these Broken Wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right
Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the fresh and clood makes me whole
I need you so

So take these Broken Wings
And Learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open us and let us in ya ya
Let us in
Let us in

Baby, that's all I know
That's you're half of the fresh and blood makes me whole Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
So take these Broken Wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these Broken Wings
And Learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open us and let us in 
Ya, ya, ya ya


Take these Broken Wings
So take these Broken Wings
Take these Broken Wings
So take these Broken Wings
