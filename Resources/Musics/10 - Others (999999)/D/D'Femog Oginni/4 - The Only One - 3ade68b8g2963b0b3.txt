THE ONLY ONE

Gbogbo ohun to nshe
Ni mon ngbô
Gbogbo ohun to nsô
Ni mo nri
Gbogbo ohun to nsô
Ni mo ngbô
Gbogbo ohun to nshe
Ni mo nri

All night long
I felt like sleep on
Day and night
I wish I could get enough
Just of you

Baby you gotta watch the way
You love me
Darling you gotta watch the way
You kiss me
Maybe, I could be only one with you
I may be only one
The only one with you
I saw you moving down
I watched you strolling down
I waved to say goodbye
Just to you oouooh
Baby you gotta watch the way
You love me
Honey you gotta watch the way
You kiss me
Maybe I could be only one with you
I may be only one
The only one with you

Gbogbo ohun to nshe
Ni mo ngbô
Gbogbo ohun to nsô
Ni mo nri
Gbogbo ohun to nsô
Ni mo ngbô
Gbogbo ohun to nshe
Ni mo n ri

I saw yougrooving down
I watched you cruising on
No way to get in touch
Just to you oouhoo

Baby you gotta watch the way
You love me
Darling you gotta watch the way
You kiss me
Maybe I could be only one with you
Darling you better watch the way
You kiss me
Baby you gotta watch the way
You love me
Maybe I could be only one with you
I may be only one
The only one with you
