RENEGADE

All religion based on fear
The bible is not true
No fear at all, no sin
The illusion do not need
Every moment is the last
To be dead for next time
Love the death as the life
Constantness is the right
Love the Death as the Life

Many masters came, mostly they were slain
Every form is different, separated one
Love to be in joy, beginnig in end
Don't believe in parents, parents of the parents
Body-spirit-soul, even to know more...
