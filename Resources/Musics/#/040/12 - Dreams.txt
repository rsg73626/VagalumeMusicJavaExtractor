DREAMS

Another reason
That I breathe
Give me faith boy,
I believe
You know I want it
And all I need
So c'mon baby
Make love to me

So let your love rain down on me
So let your love rain down on me
And I'll make all your dreams reality
Oh yea
So let your love rain down on me
So let your love rain down on me and I'll fulfill your every fantasy
Oh yea

You start a fire
So deep inside
I'm burning up boy
So make it right
Take me on a journey
Beyond the stars
Take me to heaven
Unchain my heart

Oh yea
One love
To hard to be in time
I'll give you my soul
If you say that your mine

So let your love rain down on me
So let your love rain down on me
And I'll make all your dreams reality
Oh yea
So let your love rain down on me
So let your love rain down on me and I'll fulfill your every fantasy
Oh yea

So let your love rain down on me
So let your love rain down on me
And I'll make all your dreams reality
Oh yea
So let your love rain down on me
So let your love rain down on me and I'll fulfill your every fantasy
Oh yea
