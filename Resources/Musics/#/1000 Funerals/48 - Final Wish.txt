FINAL WISH

wish we were in a palace out of the world
where the others and anything never be seen
wish we imprisoned in a colourless tableau
to take forgotten hopes from colourlessness
wish we imprisoned in the depths of a note
wish we said the last goodbye by love
wish we didn't freeze in this winter's form
wish we never divide
