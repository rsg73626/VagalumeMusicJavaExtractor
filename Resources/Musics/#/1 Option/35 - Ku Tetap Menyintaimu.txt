KU TETAP MENYINTAIMU

VERSE 1
Since you've gone I couldn't find another one
Another girl to make me feel alright
There could be no other girl here but you
May be you will understand that I love you
*Everywhere I look around I see your face
It's really bugging me
OH NO
Wish there could be something that I could do
Coz tonite baby I'm gonna party all nite
CHORUS
If I love you more
I'm really wasting my time
Everybody tells me that you have found another
So tonite is the nite I'm gonna party all nite
I'll try to live my own life
VERSE 2
Remamber that we used to be together
You'd always tell me that I'm the one for you
I believe in everything that you did
It's look like I shouldn't have at all
REPEAT*
CHORUS,CHORUS
