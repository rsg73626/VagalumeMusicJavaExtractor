THE POEM

I hate the way you talk to me 
And the way you cut your hair
I hate the way you drive my car
I hate it when you stare
I hate your big dumb combat boots
And the way you read my mind
I hate you so much it makes me sick
It even makes me rhyme
I hate it 
I hate the way you're always right
I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh
Even worse when you make me cry
I hate it when you're not around 
And the fact you didn't call, 
But mostly I hate the way 
I don't hate you, not even close, 
Not even a little bit, not even at all.
