I WANT YOU TO WANT ME

I want you to want me 
I need you to need me 
I'd love you to love me 
I'm beggin' you to beg me 
I want you to want me 
I need you to need me 
I'd love you to love me 
I'll shine up my old brown shoes 
Put on a brand new shirt 
Get home early from work 
If you say that you love me 
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin' 
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin' 
Feeling all alone without a friend you know you feel like dying 
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin' 

I want you to want me 
I need you to need me 
I'd love you to love me 
I'm beggin' you to beg me 
I'll shine up my old brown shoes 
Put on a brand new shirt 
Get home early from work 
If you say that you love me 
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin' 
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin' 
Feeling all alone without a friend you know you feel like dying 
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin' 

I want you to want me 
I need you to need me 
I'd love you to love me 
I'm beggin' you to beg me 
I want you to want me 
I want you to want me 
I want you to want me 
I want you to want me
