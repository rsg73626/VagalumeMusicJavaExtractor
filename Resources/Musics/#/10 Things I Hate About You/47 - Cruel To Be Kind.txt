CRUEL TO BE KIND

Oh, I can't take another heartache 
Though you say you're my friend 
I'm at my wits end 
You say your love is bonafide 
But that don't coincide 
With the things that you're doing 
When I ask you to be nice 
You say you gotta be 
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure 
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign 
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you 
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind 
Well, I do my best to understand dear 
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why 
I pick myself up off the ground 
And have you knock me back down 
Again and again 
And when I ask you to explain 
You say you gotta be 
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure 
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign 
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you 
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind 
Well, I do my best to understand dear 
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why 
I pick myself up off the ground 
And have you knock me back down 
Again and again 
And when I ask you to explain 
You say you gotta be 
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure 
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign 
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you 
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind
