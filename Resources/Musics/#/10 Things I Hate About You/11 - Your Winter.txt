YOUR WINTER

Grey Ceiling on the Earth 
Well it's lasted for a while 
Take my thoughts for what they're worth 
I've been acting like a child 

Your opinion, what is that? It's just a different point of view 

So, what else what else can I do? 
I said I'm sorry, and I'm sorry 

I said I'm sorry but what for if I hurt you 
Then I hate myself, I don't wanna hate myself, don't wanna hurt you 

Why do you choose your pain 
If you only knew 
How much I love you, Love you 

And I won't be your winter 
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry 
We can be forgiven 
And I will be here

Old picture on the shelf 
Well it's been there for a while 
Frozen image of ourselves 
We were acting like a child 
Inoccent and in a trance
A dance that lasted for a while
You read my eyes just like your diary 
Oh remember please remember 

Well I'm not a begger, but once more, 
Well if I hurt you, then I hate myself, I don't want to hate myself 
Don't want to hurt you 

Why do you choose your pain 
If you only knew how much I love you, Love you 

I won't be your winter 
I won't be anyone's excuse to cry 
and we can be forgiven 
And I will be here

I won't be your winter 
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry 
We can be forgiven 
And I will be here

And I won't be your winter 
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry 
we can be forgiven 
And I will be here
