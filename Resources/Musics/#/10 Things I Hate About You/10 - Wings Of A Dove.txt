WINGS OF A DOVE

Take time for your pleasure 
And laugh with love 
Take the hand of another 
And sing for the wings of a dove 

Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 

Look up at the rooftops 
When you're walking 'round 
Don't think for a moment 
Of looking down 

Woah woah, (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 

Ha-lellujah (lellujah) 
Ha-lellujah (lellujah) 

Look up at the rooftops (the roof) 
When you're walking 'round 
Don't think for a moment 
Of looking down 

At a room at the top 
Where we're not allowed 
Cheer to the echo 
Can you hear the sound 

Woah woah, (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 

Yeah yeah yeah (etc.) 

Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 
Woah woah, for the wings of a dove 
Et cetera 

Blue Train! 

Blue train taking me from you
