CALYPSO-SPIDERBAIT

Sunshine,
On the window,
Makes me happy,
Like I should be

Outside,
All around me,
Really sleazy,
Then it hits me

Don’t tell me,
You can see,
What It means to me,
Leave me…

Meanwhile,
In the moonlight,
Purple people,
Unforeseeable

Loving,
Yes it may be,
Very peachy,
Then it hits me

Don’t tell me,
You can see,
What It means to me,
Leave me be

Leave me…

Don’t tell me,
You can see,
What it means to me,
Leave me be
