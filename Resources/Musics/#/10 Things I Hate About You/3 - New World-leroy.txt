NEW WORLD-LEROY

raised the prices yesterday 
at the grocery store
reckless man hangin out front
always gets ignored
can we ever solve these problems
in our changing world?
will our children ever get 
to play out in the yard?

CHORUS
theres a new kinda world thats takin over
its got devils its got angels sittin on my shoulders
theres a new kinda world thats takin over
there aint no miles, second chances
there aint no turnin back

living in this epidimic
population surge
will the future of tomorrow
what will they deserve?
how much further can we go 
with all these spinnin wheels? 
& will my children recognize 
the world we all built?

CHORUS (3x)
