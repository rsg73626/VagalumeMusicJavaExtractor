SHINE DOWN

Oh yeah...
Why won't you give me that star that shine down?
I'm so there
If you show me that i'm on your mind now
I know it's still the same
When you're trippin
You can believe﻿ anything
But I got reasons to race like a Jesus
Walking on in the rain...

You turn around, you wanna leave
You can't afford, you can't believe
I'm trying baby if I'm gonna fade away...
If you﻿ let it, if you let it shine down...
If you let it, if you let it shine down...

But don't talk, no need to speak
Just turn it on, if what i'm feeling
I'm trying baby if I'm gonna fade away...
If you﻿ let it, if you let it shine down...
If you let it, if you let it shine down...
