VIOLATE

Is there a lie that lights your way...
Baby
Is there a love that keeps you safe
Is there force to feel not taste
Aa...
Can it tell tell you who you hate

If you been strung a long
Maybe a way too long
Then

We're comin' to America
To violate
All of your hatred
Isolate
All of your hardest hearts
Do it all for america

We're comin' to America
To violate
All your faith and
Christ parade
It's not so cool now

Do it all for America

I'll give you this much
U got a style
I bet you're real tuff
You know your rights

But baby I'm sure
You live a lie
Never
Waste a chance
To come out swinging

Yesterday I was walking alone on the street
Wonderin who wonderin who I'd meet
Saw jesus he was walking right next me
Told me I was was everything I had to be
So

Is there song that you love to sing...
Are there things that make you happy
Is there way calm you down
Or are you thinkin' too much now
VIOLATE

Is there a lie that lights your way...
Baby
Is there a love that keeps you safe
Is there force to feel not taste
Aa...
Can it tell tell you who you hate
