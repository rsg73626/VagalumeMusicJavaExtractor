SPACE AND TIME

I remember in the space and time
And I remember what we were like
All the matter was synthesized

Yeah I remember when the future died
And all the rain will keep it dark
Because of why I'm so alone

Oh give me that
Let me change
I take my love
A higher place
The matter of fact
Don't matter why
It's alright

We could be
Only this time
Reaching back
Across the line
You and me
Never asking why
Alright
