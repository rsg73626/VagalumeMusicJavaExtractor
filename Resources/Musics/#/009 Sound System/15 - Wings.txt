WINGS

Sha na na na a oh a oh

My wings
Will take
Me higher

All day
As I
Go flyin'

Take look out any window
On any morning
On any evening
Every day

My wings

Get me higher higher

Oh people on the street
Oh people of the beat
Oh everyone you meet

Now I'm flying away so high
Going where the rythem it never dies
And do it one more time
