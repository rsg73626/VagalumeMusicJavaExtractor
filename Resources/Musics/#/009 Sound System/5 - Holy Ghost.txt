HOLY GHOST

You could be the holy ghost
I could be the one you love
Cryin out for one more
Overlo(ar)d

You could be the soul that tried
Flyin on a dream tonight
And comin back just wanting
A little more

Keepin it stronger
Oh baby for longer
Never so hon it(st)
Bout bein' alone
Oh oh oh...

Strung out on those feelings
Cuz people just need things
No sense in believin'
