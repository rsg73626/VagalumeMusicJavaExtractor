DREAM WE KNEW

Turn off the noise
Turn off the line
Tvs just making you paranoid

Get out of bed
S' all in your head
Nobody cares enough to get upset

I'm still here
Y' couldn't switch gears
Couldn't get you on the phone for half a year
Half a year....

Sometimes I
Wonder why
The dream we knew won't sleep with both
Of us tonight...
Us tonight...

I look at you now
I' don't think you're the only one
Driftin' in a sea of memories gone

I guess that somehow
You'll pick yourself off the ground
But I wonder if by then I'll be gone

Hey
How you gonna find your way
Don't believe you've figured it out
Don't believe there's nothing left to say
Yeah
I need you to come around
It's all clear the facts are out
But the chance may not come back this way

I
Saw
You
Together in a
Dream
We
Knew
I was never gonna give you up
I was never gonna give you up

Lookin' back now
Yeah I guess we had a way to go
When you're young
You always think you're good as gold

Tried to bring you in deep
But still you stayed a mystery
And I didn't want to let that go

I
Had
You
Together in a
Dream
We
Knew
I could never ever give you up
I could never ever give you up
