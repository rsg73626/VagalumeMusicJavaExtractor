TRINITY

I, yeah I'm coming home again to you
'Cause you're my only friend
I'll lean into the spirits' hands
Believe in trinity again
Like it'll never end

Black stars
Big night
You were runnin' fast all of your life
I know that feelin'
I know it ain't easy.

(No matter if u try)
Livin' for just one day
Or savin' up the holy grace
I never be ashamed to call his name
Trinity's a friend

If you look at me now
Through your dying eyes
And tell me your fate
Maybe just survives

I'll show you... mine
