WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG

Jamie was a pretty little small town girl
From her daddy's porch
Watching the world rolling slowly
It always seemed so boring

Her boyfriend jimmy worked 9 to 5
Doing alright
But thought he could make a move
Said jamie baby hit the road with me
Watch what we'll do
No we won't lose

Cuz' when you're young you take the money
And run you never realize when you do it for the first time that
You always pay the price......

Late one night
On a freeway stop
They took some credit cards
From the glove of a white '08 corolla
They said they'd be high rollers

And jimmy bought jenny some diamonds and pearls
For a week two
They were livin' on top of the world
They hit the road running south still thought that they won't lose
No they won't lose

Jimmy and jenny kept running enjoying their lives
Spendin' all that money
Not savin' a dime
Such a good run
They didn't think to try to hold on

First cop shows up at the motel door
Said are you jimmy james
Jimmy says yes it's true
But we're six miles from mexico
I know what we'll do
Jamie and me can't lose
