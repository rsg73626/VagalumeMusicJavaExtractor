JUST A FALSE! JUST A HOLE!

It's just a false. Just a hole. Just a false. Just a hole

Everything I really want me to be
I'm lookin' at keys like it's lookin' cause I want me to be
The greed is making me high. On and on !
It's just a false. Just a hole. Just a false. Just a hole

I'm singin' and keepin' you and a dirty play at the Freedom Studio !
I'm closin' the TV show and the final actions set on MAC !

I wanna kill you. You wanna kill me. I wanna kill you. You wanna kill me
I wanna kill you. You wanna kill me. I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you

Never is a long day. Never say die ! Never is a long day. Never say die !
Never is a long day. Never say die ! I wanna kill you

I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality

I wanna kill you. You wanna kill me. I wanna kill you. You wanna kill me
I wanna kill you. You wanna kill me. I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you

Never is a long day. Never say die ! Never is a long day. Never say die !
Never is a long day. Never say die ! I wanna kill you

I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
I keep in with you. Keep it away. Keep it away from reality
Na Na Na Na Na...
