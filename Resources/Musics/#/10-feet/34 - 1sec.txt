The one step made from strains power
And a next step you got overcome the trauma
At the next stage, you can changing past me
Saa hanate more more no spirit
The ego and load on one's mind will make your mind dirty
Hey ready ! Brake it ! Brake it !
Come and shout in the free. Shout in the free !

The anchovy was recorded on the cheese
And, it deluges it about big coke
And, the steak of the same size as the face
Try for bigger than balls beef
The anchovy was recorded on the cheese. And,
It deluges it about big coke
And, the steak of the same size as the face
Try for bigger than balls
Pizza fight ! Pizza fight ! Pizza flying, yeah ! Pizza fight !

Steak ! And we got a nachos. Care ! And we got fattest
Shit ! And we got a beer belly. Can't go back

Tightness and a funky groove. Tightness and funky joke
Cross decades, over time after so many wars are done
The ocean wraps and melts it all. Tightness and a funky joke
Cross decades, over time after so many wars are done.

Yeah ! No ! Burning on and on ! Yeah ! No ! Burning on and on !
I just can't take. Myself I hate. I fight through late
My flame shining bright
I just can't take. Myself I hate. I fight through burning bright
