JOY

Here we go
I'm ready
Hey
La la la la la la la la
Hey

There's a joy in children seeing santa at the mall
There's a joy that brightens of this season bring us all
How can these compare to the good news the angels tell?
Heaven has sent us a savior
What a night there is no greater!

Jo-o-o-oy, jo-o-o-oy
Light a star on the christmas tree
Love has come for you and me
Jo-o-o-oy, jo-o-o-oy
I hear the carols on the radio
So turn it up and let the whole world know

Because I've got a love that's so
There is no greater joy

I hear it in the bells they're ringing up and down the street
I see it shining in the smiles of everyone I meet
It feels to me like hope is stirring with the winter wind
Heaven has sent us a savior
What a night there is no greater!

Jo-o-o-oy, jo-o-o-oy
Hang a star on the christmas tree
Love has come for you and me
Jo-o-o-oy, jo-o-o-oy
I hear the carols on the radio
So turn it up and let the whole world know

Because I've got a love that's so
There is no greater joy

Joy to the world
All heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
Yeah yeah
Joy to the world
OOh

Jo-o-o-oy, jo-o-o-oy
Hang a star on the christmas tree
Love has come for you and me
Jo-o-o-oy, jo-o-o-oy
I hear the carols on the radio
So turn it up and let the whole world know

Because I've got a love that's so
There is no greater joy
