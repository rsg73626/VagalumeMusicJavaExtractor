WHILE WE'RE YOUNG

We've all heard people talking
About all the things that they regret
And what they would change to do it again
We know our story's just starting
So much is unwritten, yeah
We're gonna go right
When the world goes left

Cause we don't wanna waste even one of these days

We're gonna save ourselves
The heartache
We're not looking back
On what we wish we'd done
We're gonna risk it all
For one thing
And live for Jesus while we're young
while we're young

young (x3)

There's gonna be some up times
There's gonna be some real steep climbs
So it's here and now that we decide
If we're gonna be ready
For the days when life hits hard
We're gonna know for sure now who we are

Cause we don't wanna waste even one of these days

We're gonna save ourselves
The heartache
We're not looking back
On what we wish we'd done
We're gonna risk it all
For one thing
And live for Jesus while we're young
while we're young

young (x3)

We know who we are
A chosen generation
We know who we are
This our declaration

Cause we don't wanna waste even one of these days

We're gonna save ourselves
The heartache
We're not looking back
On what we wish we'd done
We're gonna risk it all
For one thing
And live for Jesus while we're young

We're gonna save ourselves
The heartache
We're not looking back
On what we wish we'd done
We're gonna risk it all
For one thing
And live for Jesus while we're young (put your hand up)
while we're young

young (x3)
