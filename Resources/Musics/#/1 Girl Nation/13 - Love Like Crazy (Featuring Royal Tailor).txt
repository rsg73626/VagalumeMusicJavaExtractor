LOVE LIKE CRAZY (FEATURING ROYAL TAILOR)

It's a desert out there
People running scared
Looking everywhere for hope

We are meant to burn bright
Be a light
Illuminate the night sky
Hey, hey, hey

We gotta be the spark
Show the world who we are
And love like crazy
We gotta follow to lead
Take a stand on our knees
And love like crazy

We're gonna let it shine
We wanna live like Christ
We gotta be the spark
Show the world who we are
And love like crazy

There's not a second to waste
Way too much at stake
We're gonna wreck this place with love
With lo-ove

Oh oh
How He loves us so
(He loves like crazy)
Oh oh
Let the whole world know
(He loves like crazy)
