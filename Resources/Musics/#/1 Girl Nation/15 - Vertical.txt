VERTICAL

All the broken
All the hopeless
Strangers in need
They are with us
They are Jesus
All the least of these

Oh oh oh Lord
How we need Your strength to stand
Oh oh oh Lord
Help us be Your feet and hands

We're going vertical
Praying for miracles
Wanna see heaven here on earth
Lifting our hands up high
People of God unite
Together we can change this world

We're going vertica oh oh oh (x2)
