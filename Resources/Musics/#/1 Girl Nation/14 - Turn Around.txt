TURN AROUND

Yeah, you're stuck on a one way street
The ground is shaking beneath your feet
And it seems
You're not where you're meant to be

Yeah, you're running so far away
With every step you can feel the weight
And it seems
That you have fallen out of reach
But you don't have to stay down

Cause you're never too far
From a brand new start
You can
Turn around
Turn around
Cause where you have been
Isn't who you are
You can
Turn around
Turn around

You don't have to stay down
He can lift you up now
Cause you're never too far
From a brand new start
You can
Turn around
Turn around

Second chances are in His hands
He'll forgive you
Even when you can't
He sees
All that you were meant to be
Oh, and He can lift you up now

It's not too late for you
His love has never moved
