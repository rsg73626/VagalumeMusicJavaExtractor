STATEN ISLAND STAND UP

Intro: Solomon Childs] 
Yeah.. kill 'em.. mothafucka.. 

[Chorus: Solomon Childs] 
Q-Borough with the Mac's up 
Staten Island Stand Up 
Brooklyn, forever act up 
Harlem World, forever on the stack up 
The BX'll leave you clapped up 

[Solomon Childs] 
To this game be like Ron Harper 
Work out more hammers than fat bitches work with Jane Fonda 
A bite with poison, like an anaconda 
West Brighton, New York City, the sponsor 
Theodore Unit, gorillas in the contra 
East Coast monster, Solomon Childs the conquer 
We in the years where the summers are shorter and the winters are colder 
The blood runnin' through the babies' veins are darker 
Keep the cannons in the parker 
Never "Who that?", see that? Eat that, never been a champagne sipper 
Stay bent off the Remi/Dom, skipper 
Fuck bodyguards, respect armed robbery, dog 
Stretched out, blowin' Newports 
Back to back, enjoy the classic of criminal acts 
From the School of Hard Knocks, bulletproof trucks and glocks 

[Hook: Shawn Wigs] 
It's that Einstein Theodore theory, street philosophies 
Step foot on our block, it's no way possibly 
Guns too big for you to ever try stoppin' me 
Talk out ya mouth, you better speak properly 

[Solomon Childs] 
20-04 bloodsport (come on), haywire like garlic anemi' in Southport 
No remorse (no), report more bloodbaths than Dan Rathers in Iraq (yeah) 
Ya done seen me in more facilities up North than the sightin's of 2Pac 
For the first time you got an MC with hunger (get 'em!) 
Kill for land like guerilla fighters in Baghdad 
Pillows of haze the size of Glad bags (yeah) 
S. Childs (uh-huh) a/k/a/ Street Glory (get 'em!) 
This a true story, straight beef 
I'll leave you for dead under the subway stairs like cold cheeks (get 'em!) 
Get ready for the new founded East Coast beasts 

[Chorus x2] 

[Outro: Solomon Childs (Shawn Wigs)] 
Mothafucka, lookin' all stupid in ya mothafuckin' face (uh-hu.. yeah) 
Reportin' live from Def Jam, nigga (oh shit!) 
Move, move (This is Theodore theory.. stand up!)
