DROP!

"Drop!" 

[Shawn Wigs] 
You should be thankful, brother man, life is a struggle 
You little Barnum and Bailey clowns, can't fuck with the hustle 
You wanna juggle, I scramble on the block like eggs and fuck 
Drunk white girls, behind the bush and kegs, take crack to my legs 
I smoke twenties of the skama, I don't fuck with regs 
Give me a break, I keep my kit kat in my pants 
Who wanna blow me, cuz I don't got time for romance 
Got a brand new truck with no shoes on the whip 
I mean none, that bitch is just sitting on bricks 
It's my fault, shouldn't let the spree sit in the hood 
With no locks on the wheels, love is love, it's all good 
Cop a new pair, that's a donation to the block 
Got Roc-A-Fella money, but ain't, the-the Roc 
This is Starks Enterprise, fourth coming of the truth 
We old school playa, taking it back to Troops 

"Drop!" 

[Shawn Wigs] 
Life is a bakery, smoke til I cough up a long 
Got a mean Aftermath like Andre Young 
Milky Way rocks, socks with the face of Versace 
Times Square posters of me and John Gotti 
Snipe with the rifle, double pump shotty 
Coked up, slumped over with my nose all snotty 
Twenties on the back of the whip, tens in the front 
Ski goggles on the Benz, with the engine in the trunk 
I'mma gangsta, the shoes on my whip got chips 
And I live down the block, because of some slip disk 
Rock on wrists, new key slang socialist 
'03, putting bounties on the heads of these terrorists 

"Drop!" 

[Shawn Wigs] 
Aiyo, fresh off the Island, I fiend for raw fish 
Murder green weed and my heart won't switch 
I'm stubborn, tuck ya little brownies in the oven 
I bake cakes, milk big labels like shakes 
For advances and office space, I want Russell's place 
The original's back, fuck the fakes 
Ya'll flakes can't rock, we '52 pick-up 
New face in the game, your whole crew got shook up 

"Drop!"
