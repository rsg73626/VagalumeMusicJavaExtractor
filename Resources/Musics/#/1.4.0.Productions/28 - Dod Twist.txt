DOD TWIST

"Only the Gods could watch the Earth twist" -> Nas (cut and scratched) 

[Intro: Lighter Shade] 
Let your mind... be free 

[Crunch Lo] 
Yo God it ain't hard, double-edge forever scar 
Twelve deadly bars laid down like hot tar 
Star catcher, better than the metro, guns let go 
Faster than gas or pedal, just spread metal 
on the pedestal, sit back collect revenues 
Man, I'm tellin' you, intervene the scene and I'm jellin' you 
Live at the Savoy we can build and destroy 
We could dance with the wolves and play with gun toys 
Majestic mind, break the vertebrae of your spine 
Shut down the comp of time, my name is defined 
Could reign, nobly shine, a hundred years down the line 
O.F. committee, fifty niggaz stand behind 
Corn braid, 'fro or fade, goat-shave like Venetian 
Blessed magician, Q keep the green twistin' 
Engine, Wigs look, my son make a move first 
Mercury rise and the thermometer burst 
From the heat of Fahrenheit, damage a mic on the humble 
While y'all niggaz half-step I Aztec through the jungle 
Speak of Beneeni, laid back cat, just be easy 
Chokin' on the shit to get ya lungs all wheezy 

[Hook: sample cut and scratched 4X] 
"Only the Gods could watch the Earth twist" -> Nas 

[Cheesey Rat] 
Y'all cats, can't even look my way 
Blessed generation war, either you hot or you not, son 
Pop one for L.S.T. and me, Cisco MC 
Reppin' infinity, four-fifth waves 
Staten Island daze is like, can't even read my pager right 
Losin' my sight, go towards the light, son 
Fightin' one too many times, niggaz take ya shine 
Rock 'em like their mines 
With Nike signs 'til the Timberland comes 
Swimmin' in drums, blow a cop police where we from 
Because you talk too much plus you're eager to run 
Behind me stands a nation, knowledge through power 
Generation, thoughts racin', first but not ya final confrontation 
Seen the, realest get tested, Willies I never messed with 
Can't seem to stop gettin' arrested 
Some say I'm desperate, left with bad thoughts 
Real niggaz don't talk, we bring it straight to the war 
At full court 

[Hook] 

[Lighter Shade] 
The final thoughts I've learned youth somethin', I burn crews 
Turn youths, preacher of the germ blues and sperm tools 
Wanna recreate another beginnin', makin' moves on religion 
Movin' niggaz life, the space prison 
The revelation still glistens, no one listens 
I've broken down the math of, fifty solar systems 
Back to the street life, we greet with the knife 
Some speak through the ice, my advice, I'm a white knight 
That'll shine bright, and Noreaga, you got my click actin' ill behavior 
What up, dunn? We feel ya flavor 
Hold tight, on this planet, where the mind's greater 
One day you drop a gem, yo, with the white savior 
Through shoutout to all the thug drug scouts 
If you're real Bout It, Bout It, one day you'll have to re-a-route it 
I'm from the blended school of Mt. Carmel 
Eatin' five sent caramels on the carousel 
At the time my father was incarcerated in his holy cell 
Me and the Angel Gabriel, flyin' parallel 
Together, 'til the last wind, a final weather 
Every bloody letter I rewrite with a feather 
Changin' never to ever, who's clever on my agenda? 
Makin' evil evil surrender, part of December 

[Hook]
