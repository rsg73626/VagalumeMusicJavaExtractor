SHOT ME DOWN

[Intro: Lounge Lo] 
That's right.. I see you 
Aiyo, Wigs, you see him? Let's go him 

[Lounge Lo] 
Aiyo, loose goose, run with a deuce and set a truce 
With a .38, damn Billy, why you had to crack the milli and skate 
Damn, pardon a nigga, cuz I had to put the 15, AR on the nigga 
My gun is a talker, and me? A Shaolin New Yorker 
Fuck that, you can bring your balls and meet on the court 
My girl taller, and all about the streets and the fork 
And she know about the heat when it scorch, she got my back 
And she always losed out, when peepin' the horse 
And the guns are going off on the Staten, of course 
Ask the police, how we get clapped on the cross 
Of course, Park Hill hillbillies, Wild West 
Jungle Nilz, Now Born, and them Stapletown dust phillies 
We load the guns and plus we ready 
And for a out of town nigga, that's a plus for heavy 

[Molly-Q] 
Yo, starving like Marvin Hagler, marvelous 
Fabulous, five mic poetist, golden grips 
Holding hits, writing what a wish, like a birthday gift 
Blowing out candles, gamble, the rap Mickey Mantle 
Money taker scrambler, smoking weed by the handful 
Twelve bar vandals, open mics is what I ran through 
Crack sneakers, wife beaters, benz white juice 
See the leaning lay back, twisting reefer 
Puzzle missing pieces, hustle like Jesus 
Rap bible books, and preachers gotta bust they guns up in the breachers 

[Shawn Wigs] 
Yo, this is Staten Island, you can get crashed like stocks 
Smack with a green machine, or some classic Reeboks 
Rock a fox coat, keep a big heater in the lining 
We in a big lead, O, we slid right past the minors 
We major, rainbow Skittles, pack flavor 
We spit and spaz the fuck out, what up neighbor? 
It's the kings of cliche, muscled your DJ 
Slid through the blocks, slapped the ones all on your PJ's 
Bite your mic, tore the sole off your sneakers 
Staten Island Stand Up, bust guns in the bleachers 

[Crunch Lo] 
So Park Hill, West Brighton, New Brighton, the Harbor 
Stapleton, Port Town, forty cals and pounds 
We on the mound like a pitcher, dreams of getting richer 
Reach for the stars and found the big dipper 
My niggas stand up, front and get blammed up 
Ran a hundred deep in the club, we man up 
The gemstar spitter, I've never been a quitter 
I run real close and throw the toast to your liver 
A heatwave, or I give you a close shave 
At close range, muthafucka, playing no games 
We keep the metal spraying, more than Olympics 
Our thoroughness is vengeance, we going hard 
From four quarters, relentless 
We been this live, nigga, no monkey jive 
We fuck queen bees and conquer the bee hive 
The modern day Hannibals, thugged out animals 
Straight from the zoo, clear the whole block with the tech 22
