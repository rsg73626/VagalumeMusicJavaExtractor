DREAMS

Only now do you realize
As the tears pour from your eyes
Whatever is left can never replace
Whatever is lost whatever the price

Don't regret the choices that you made
It's too late now
It's too late now
When all that's left is an empty shell
You start to think, you start to dream

Embrace all you have known
Be it truth or lies
Let the truth stand alone
Now you fell and steal kisses
What drives bringing blade to wrist
