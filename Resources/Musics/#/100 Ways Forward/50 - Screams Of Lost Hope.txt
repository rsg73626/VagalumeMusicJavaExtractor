SCREAMS OF LOST HOPE

I'll hide
Away from the sun
Inside
As christ burns

You are blinded by your bloodshot eyes
You are deafend by the screams of lost hope
How can you live like this
How can you live like this

As the people around you fall to the ground
You close your eyes and close your mind 
There's nothing left to know.
