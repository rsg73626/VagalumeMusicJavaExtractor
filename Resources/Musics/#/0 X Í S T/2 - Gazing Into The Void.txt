GAZING INTO THE VOID

Gazing into the void
Trifling hidden screams
I am purified
And I feel no soul

If it wasn't for real
I don't know what was
It feels that I have lost
The breath of life's flow

How I wished to be endless
Now I wish to be dead
I have only one more request
Mark every word that I have said
GAZING INTO THE VOID

Gazing into the void
Trifling hidden screams
I am purified
And I feel no soul

If it wasn't for real
I don't know what was
It feels that I have lost
The breath of life's flow

How I wished to be endless
Now I wish to be dead
I have only one more request
Mark every word that I have said
