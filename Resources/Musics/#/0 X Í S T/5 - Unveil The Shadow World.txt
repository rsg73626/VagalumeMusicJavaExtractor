UNVEIL THE SHADOW WORLD

What is left for those who survive physical dying
A universe or a black hole to never arrive in
A limbo state at the corner of a dark world
The phlegmatic joy in knowing the path to more
And to nothing at all

We live; we die, returning to the hereafter
Do wee seek to exist, or to hide behind one another?

Us - via negative, devils for the cause
Blood on his claws
I - the eye, watchman of the triangle
And unrestricted wisdom

You who like to be watched but have not yet been observed -
Unveil the shadow world
