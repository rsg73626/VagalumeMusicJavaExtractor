ONE OVER INFINITY

To cross the rubicon
And choose to solve the unsolved
To break boundaries
And be bound to the path of the vertices

I am nothing, yet I am all
One over infinity - watch them fall
Equal to none, infinite chaotic god
A complex universe - parallel entropy

I am the one without end
Unbound - existence
A xeper's leaf, wine of life
Blood and soul, one of a kind - all

The final curtain of death
A sealed gateway to life
The meaning and the essence
Of becoming alive
