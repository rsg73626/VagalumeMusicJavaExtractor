STAY

If i was to sit beside you,
I wouldnt know what to say,
I did everything you wanted to,
Why do you treat me this way.
I took you places you wanna go,
I even called you on the phone,
You said tonight would be the one..
When i call your not even home.
Tell me more...
Did i want you to treat me this way?
Tell me more...
Please, the reason is, i dont really wanna stay.
You give me ancy promises,
Wich that you dont spend to keep.
I give you trust and confidence,
You give me doubt and sleep.
Tell me more.
Did i want you to treat me this way?
Tell me more.
Or do you read my lips "im not here to stay"
I know you've heard this song before,
You dont want this.
It will get you a self guided say
"im not gonna...miss.....this chance"
Tell me more.
Did i want you to treat me this way?
Tell me more.
Please, relax, i dont really wanna stay.
