YOU DON'T KNOW

you say, it's ok, didn't have to be this way
you say, it's alright, maybe someday I'll get it right
but I'm confused, and i don't know what to do
you hate the things i do, but you know you do them to
i never wanted it this way, but you left me without a
choice
you don't know what you want, and you know i don't what
i want to
you don't know what you need, but i know one thing
its that i don't need...

you say, its ok, it didn't have to be this way
you say, thats just fine, you got whats yours, and you
got mine.
but I'm confused, and i don't know what to do
you hate the things i do, but you know you do them to
i never wanted it this way, but you left me without a
choice
you don't know what you want, and you know i don't what
i want to
you don't know what you need, but i know one thing
its that i don't need...

you don't know what you want, and you know i don't what
i want to
you don't know what you need, but i know one thing
its that i don't need you.
