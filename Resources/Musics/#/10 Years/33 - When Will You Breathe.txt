WHEN WILL YOU BREATHE

Looking into dark skies makes you
Feel this lonelyness that breaks you.

But you made it through this (x2)

The stars shine,
To tell you it's okay now.
Your fighting,
But you still cannot breathe now.

But you made it through this (x2)

I know you hate this.
The tears roll down your face.
To pale complections,
Are stone and won't erase.

Your eyes closed,
Every night waiting to be there.
The morning fucks your plan.
When will you breathe?

But you made it through this (x2)

I know you hate this.
The tears roll down your face,
To pale complections,
Are stone and won't erase. (x4)
