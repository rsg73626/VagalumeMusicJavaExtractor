PACEMAKER

Their comfort amazes me
Numbered and placed as drones
Our spinal cords are breaking their falls
Diamonds pressed and molds defeated goes the status quo I

I should have noticed
Slightly unfocused are you
I should have known
You’re cleverly brilliant
I should have known
I should have known all along

Treat you more as a leper
Feeding against method

Cataclysmic chaos must occur for his return then
Please wish it now, all on yourself
So that we may enjoy Christ in you

I should have known you’re cleverly brilliant
I should have known
I should have known all along

Treat you more as a leper
Feeding against method

Ah (3X)

One by one we fall

Turn this into gold
So I can count it
Turn this into gold
So I can count it

Treat you more as a leper
Feeding against method

Ah (3x)

One by one we fall
