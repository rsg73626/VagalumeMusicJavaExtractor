TRIGGERS AND TRIPWIRES

Where's your verse, your verb, proverb, lesson learned
Are you out of words, out of time, out of mind
(no I'm doing fine)
What's the worst that could happen if the nurse
Ain't back when you birth turns blue
(it's a matter of time
With a doubting will to live, keep drowning
Little pills down, a little bit more in you


No feelings, smooth sailing in this sinking ship
Taking the devil in the details, again and again
Wasting every bit of free will from your skin


Aww there's no way to save a shred of the day
When it's weathered and worn away nightly
We keep killing time in the blink of an eye
Trying to walk a straight line with kaleidoscope eyes
As we're flooding the brain til the levees break
With no memory, we're destined to repeat this injury


No feelings, smooth sailing in this sinking ship
Taking the devil in the details, again and again
Wasting every bit of free will from your skin
Was it what you wanted? (taken)
Forbidden from the garden (wasted)
Was it what you wanted
The devil in the details, again and again


I've used up all the time I've borrowed
Who will reunite when the tomb is hollow?


Taking the devil in the details, again and again
Wasting every bit of free will from your skin
Was it what you wanted? (taken)
Forbidden from the garden (wasted)
Was it what you wanted
The devil in the details, again and again
