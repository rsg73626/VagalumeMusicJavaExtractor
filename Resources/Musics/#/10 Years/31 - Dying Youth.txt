DYING YOUTH

Deep under the surface
I keep the love
Older and aware of
A hidden universe
I pray to be young
And pray to be inspired
But the words of your tongue
Blister like fire
I can’t let you go
Slow down
Don’t leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me
There is a glimpse
Of death in your eyes
I’m not prepared
To let out those cries
I pray to be young
Soon to be expired
So lost in denial
I can’t let you go
Slow down
Don’t leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me
Reach in her womb
Sheltered from strife
Bearing the gifts
And burdens of life
I pray to stay young
But soon will be expired
An age innocence
Long since gone
I can’t let you go
Slow down
Don’t leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me
Those who
Are looking backwards
Chose to
Live as statues
Frozen fractured
Youthful laughter
Fades
I can’t let you go
Slow down
Don’t leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me
I can’t let you go
Slow down
Don’t leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me
I can’t let you go
Slow down
Don’t leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me
