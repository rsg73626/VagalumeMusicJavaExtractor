FOCUS

Digging deeper in my mind, can't get you out of my head.
There's no way to describe, just how you make me feel.
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away.

I can't focus, when I'm near you.
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you.
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

Like the moth fly's to the light, catch it at first sight
I can't deny, I'm taken by the beauty in your eye's
I don't know is it love, I have lost control.
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away.

I can't focus, when I'm near you.
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you.
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

I can't focus, when I'm near you.
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you.
Do you notice?
Do you notice?
I can't focus, when I'm near you.
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you.
Do you notice, that I can't focus?
