FROM BIRTH TO BURIAL

You're next in line
To love me for the night
So say goodbye
And leave me on high
Don't darken my door
With your light
Your long winded lies

Of a short mended life
I die by design on a dim
Drag me alone
Singing this song
Bury my bones
When the glory is gone

The infection is left
To the heart and the head
The infection is left
To the heart and the head

All my mind you ment some accomish
Ment some lost and let behind
How do I find it in
I can't remember how this began
There's no royalty in shooting stars
Just void fees and value scars
For every birth there is a death
For every sunrise there was a set

I cast my pride
As fucking my eyes
Discolored and oxidized
Ignore the presigns
Just how to survive
If I fight when this
Dream is dying

Farewell, welfare
Farewell, welfare

Don't darken my door
With your light
Long winded lies
Of a short mended life
I die by design on a dim
Bury my bones
When the glory is gone

Farewell, welfare
Farewell, welfare

We're dying in stereo
From birth to burial
We're dying in stereo
From birth to burial
So say goodbye
You loved me for the night

Farewell, welfare
Farewell, welfare
We're dying in stereo
From birth to burial
We're dying in stereo
From birth to burial
