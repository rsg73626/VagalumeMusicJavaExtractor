JUST CAN'T WIN

You and I, share the same reflection
Why don't you see that we cannot
Survive in this condition?
If you're cut, I'll bleed

So go on, carve into your own heart
I could use a new scar or a brand new start
Slowly severing the only memories
That bind us as one

I just don't know how to win
With you?
And I can't let go, part of me
Is you

We have lost all communication
When words fall on deaf ears
I'm starting to feel a transformation
How did I get here?

I don't recognize my own reflection
It's a ghost of what once was
Gone from relative to stranger
Separating body from mind

I just don't know how to win
With you?
And I can't let go, part of me
Is you

You stay the same
How will I remain to change?

I just don't know how to win
With you?
And I can't let go, part of me
Is you

I just don't know
Just don't know
I can't let go
Can't let go
