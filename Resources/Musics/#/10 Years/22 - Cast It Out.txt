CAST IT OUT

Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry

Touch with frustrated lips
Love is like starting over
With every step engraving the problems of memories

Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry

Drunks on failures regrets
Letters of silence confess burdens within
Speaking as loneliness listens
While hopelessly feeling

Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry

There's a definite pattern to our behavior
Somehow the end draws us closer

Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry

Blacking out
Cast it out
