PROUD OF YOU

Shadows set the mood
Innocence left the room
And all I know to do is shed a tear for you

Oooh
Ooooh
Oooh
Ooooh

Please don't be ashamed, whether you win or lose
I just want to tell you that I'm proud of you
Don't be afraid, when your fight is through
I just need you to know that I'm here with you

I can't watch you choose to pour salts in your wounds
Now all I know to do, is say a prayer for you

Oooh
Ooooh
Oooh
Ooooh

Please don't be ashamed, whether you win or lose
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you
Don't be afraid, when your fight is through
I just need you to know that I'm here with you

Oooh
Ooooh
Oooh
Ooooh
Oooh
Ooooh
