MAGNA-PHI

Fragile, engulf
Come on, turn on
Penetrate without touch
Lay waste the virgin you were

Come on it barely shows
I'll grow to face your God
Consumed you'll hardly know
Atrophy of souls

Fragile, engulf
Come on, turn on
Strap in and pose for the pawn that you are
Thrusting in deeper you'll beat me
Feed on the products of filth like a fiend
Worship and praise to the screen

Come dance with me
The shadows in the moonlight are calling

Strap in and pose for the pawn that you are
Thrusting in deeper you'll beat me
Feed on the products of filth like a fiend
Penetrate without touch

Self Indulgent
Your leisure
Self Indulgent
Your leisure

Force feed
Force feed
Force feed us
