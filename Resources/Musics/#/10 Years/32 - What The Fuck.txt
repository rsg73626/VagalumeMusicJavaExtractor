WHAT THE FUCK

In no end
A change
The demons of it
Capacity
A nesting
And just as tragically
My vision is burning
Is this all that i have left
And are you all that i have left

Your walls
They will come down
In this task
I will not faulter
Your walls
They will come down
I wont faulter
I WONT FAULTER

WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD FALL TO THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I COULDN'T HANDLE THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD FALL TO THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK (would make you think
that i couldnt handle this)

My thoughts and my words
too have haunted
I begged and pleaded screaming
Stop, stop, stop, stop
But now i know the truth
And i can see right into you
Is this all that i have left
And are you all that i have left

Your walls
They will come down
In this task
I will not faulter
Your walls
They will come down
I wont faulter
I WONT FAULTER

WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD FALL TO THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I COULDN'T HANDLE THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD FALL TO THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I COULDN'T HANDLE THIS?

Your walls
They will come down
In this task
I will not faulter
Your walls
They will come down
I wont fail at this
I WONT FAIL AT THIS

I wont fail at this
I wont fail at this
I wont fail at this
I wont fail at this

You will pay for this
You will pay for this
You will pay for this
You will pay for this

WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD FALL TO THIS?
WHAT THE FUCK WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I COULDN'T HANDLE THIS?
