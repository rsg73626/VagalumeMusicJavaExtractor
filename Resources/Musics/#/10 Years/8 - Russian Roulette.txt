RUSSIAN ROULETTE

It's Russian roulette with no luck.
You can kiss it good-bye there's no such thing as sympathy.
When the disease is entering.
At first glance your instinct says this stranger's a little dangerous.
The cat was killed the curious thrills.
Now Christ has left the manger.

The taste is so divine.
So divine.
A chemical come alive.
Come alive.

Welcome to your prize.
Good luck with life.
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily.

It's so nice to meet you.
It's so nice to know you.
Now that your guards down let me show you.
Superior rides from initial highs have now come back to haunt you.
Your cravings back the strangers hands for a taste that so familiar.

The taste is so divine.
So divine.
A chemical come alive.
Come alive.

Welcome to your prize.
Good luck with life.
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily.
Why will you decide when your out of time?
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily.

The battle you picked was so one sided.
Now to pin it on me the one you invited.
Let me sleep.
For redemption, for forgiveness.
Let me sleep.
Sorry I'm not listening.

Welcome to your prize.
Good luck with life.
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily.
Why will you decide when your out of time?
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily.
