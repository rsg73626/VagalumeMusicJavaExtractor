AT A LOSS

Here we in are red
Suffocating in this tie
Down with you with me
Unable to breathe force fed
Blind to this so long
Thread in mouth all senses gone
Leaves my back my chest
Six feet down it's buried dead

Turn to your back and walk away (blind)

Twisting and turning why isn't this working
Cut out the face for what cause
Do as I say at what cost
Twisting and turning why isn't this working

Beg plead and scream
Show me what you will
Iâ€™ll watch straight faced
Not another cheek
Eyes swollen
A shape I'd like to kill
Here you are in red
Stunned as you may feel

Turn to your back and walk away (blind)

Twisting and turning why isn't this working
Cut out the face for what cause
Do as I say at what cost
Twisting and turning why isn't this working
