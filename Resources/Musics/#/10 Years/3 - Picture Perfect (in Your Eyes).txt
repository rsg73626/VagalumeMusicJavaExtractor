PICTURE PERFECT (IN YOUR EYES)

In your eyes
Is the picture perfect
In your eyes
does the grass look greener have you seen it
through my eyes

The world has caught on fire
from what I've been told
These city lights (city lights)
Are Killing ever slowly the sanity with-in me
maybe I
Lost in my creation
This isn't how i thought I'd turn out

In your eyes
Im picture perfect
In your eyes
The grass is greener have you seen it
Through my eyes

(Through my eyes)

The stars are burning brighter
So bright we can't ignore
Were hyptonozed
Tramatized by train wrecks
Tragites by patience
Maybe I
A product of my placement
given no chance (a chance)
to make up my mind

In your eyes
Im picture perfect
In your eyes
The grass is greener have you seen it
Through my eyes

Cuz through my eyes

In your eyes
Im so picture perfect
In your eyes
The grass is greener have you seen it
Through my eyes

(Through my eyes)
(Through my eyes)

Through my eyes
