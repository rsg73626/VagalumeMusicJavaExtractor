PATIENTLY

Dreamscapes and fantasies
Evolve into reality when passion is pursued.
The passion turns professional,
And kills the mood.
Finding symmetry so hard to achieve;
Inspiration loves misery.
Blue skies are turning grey;
Let it rain, let it rain.

So long I've been waiting patiently;
You're not all alone.
So lost, I've been searching patiently;
We're not all alone.

Routine rituals;
Physically and mentally, pressures made complete.
Remember to appreciate the bittersweet.
Finding symmetry too hard to achieve;
Expectations test abilities,
Life is but a dream.
In our sleep, let us see.

So long I've been waiting patiently;
You're not all alone.
So lost, I've been searching patiently;
We're not all alone.

Sleep well,
All alone.
Sleep well.

It feels like so long I've been waiting patiently;
You're not all alone.
So lost, I've been searching patiently;
We're not all alone.
