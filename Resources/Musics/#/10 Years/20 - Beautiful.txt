BEAUTIFUL

Beauty over wisdom to fit in with this time
Your Cinderella stories, full of price
Vanities of business built to please the unique
Silicon and stars collide; the rest will fall at night

Chorus:
Just as beautiful as you are
Its so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along

Visioning are stimulating to my eyes
Your Cinderella syndrome, full of lies
Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your ego will kill what's left inside

(Chorus)

(Beautiful)
It's so pitiful what you are (Pitiful)
As beautiful as you are
(Should have seen)
You should have seen this coming all along

You're everything that's so typical
Maybe you're alone, for reason
You're the reason

So pitiful what you are
Should have seen this coming all along
(Beautiful)
Just as beautiful as you are
(Pitiful)
So pitiful what you are
(Should have seen)
Should have seen this coming all along
(Beautiful)
Its so pitiful what you are
(Pitiful)
As beautiful as you are
(Should have seen)
Should have seen this coming all along
