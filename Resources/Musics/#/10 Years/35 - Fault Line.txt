FAULT LINE

I felt you cut free turning cold shoulders to me
Growing blame lines communicating lies
Nothing more to trust fallacies of love
Killing all that holds you

Bring me back to this what you said useless
Leave me I'll shed my skin these scars will mend

Don't worry about me the heart is supposed to bleed
Purity is drained
Help each other die
I see it, I see it in your eyes
Killing all that holds you

Bring me back to this what you said useless
Leave me I'll shed my skin these scars will mend

Eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous
Eyes twitch and lies itch from a nervous ending
Innocence is ugly in the one who is guilty

Bring me back to this what you said useless
Leave me I'll shed my skin these scars will mend
