SHELTER

Please savior of here 
Give me shelter from fear
I need answers to this 
Crazy world that so mixed

With the pain that leaves us
Lifeless and dead-souled
We all need to
Break this mold

I’m    so   sure you’ll  blame me for this  all
What’s so   wrong you    claim to call this love
I’m    so   sure you’ll  blame me for this  all
What’s so   wrong you    claim to call this love

Drips hit the floor     
Who cares at all
Flesh sheared and torn  
sleeves hide remorse

Stardom branded skin   
traps pain within
Expectations           
never reaching

I’m    so   sure you’ll  blame me for this  all
What’s so   wrong you    claim to call this love
I’m    so   sure you’ll  blame me for this  all
What’s so   wrong you    claim to call this love
