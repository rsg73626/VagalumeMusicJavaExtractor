SHOOT IT OUT

Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now

Verse 1:
Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now
Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it a little more
You can be rest assured
You give them all you got and you give them a little more
You never even know what for
They feed and they suck until you unconscious
Its never enough until they kill your subconscious

PreChorus:
I'm ready to die

Chorus:
Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
Suffocate integrity til I'm not breathing
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)

Verse 2:
Feed them, Fucking starve them, keep begging a little more
Feed them, Fucking starve them, keep begging a little more
I'm not gonna be your whore
Load it, cock it, pull it, refuse to be ignored
I'm not gonna fight you war
All the distractions kill the compassion
Suddenly, fame has lost it's attraction

PreChorus:
I'm ready to die

Chorus:
Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
Suffocate integrity til I'm not breathing
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)

Bridge:
Feeding the wolves, don't you know better?
Feeding the wolves, the taste of blood is bitter.
(Feeding the wolves)
Feeding the wolves, don't you know better?
(Feeding the wolves)
Feeding the wolves, the taste of blood is bitter.

Chorus:
Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
(Shoot it, Shoot it out cause they want it, want it now, now)
