CYCLE OF LIFE

Faith, fact or fiction, now what is the difference?
We're all just searching for the lie
Dividing nations from confrontations
Haven?t you seen that the blind lead the blind?

We're a moment in time
In the cycle of life
We're just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

Without dedication there?s self medication
We're all just searching for the lie
Communication was lost in translation
Haven?t you seen that the blind lead the blind?

We're a moment in time
In the cycle of life
We're just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

(This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of)
(This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of)

This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of

We're a moment in time
In the cycle of life
We're just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

We're a moment in time
In the cycle of life
We're just a moment in time
In the cycle of life
