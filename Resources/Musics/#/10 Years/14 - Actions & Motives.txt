ACTIONS & MOTIVES

Wait, the fact you did it
And don't admit it won't make you innocent
Fate will find you wicked
And turns you victim for ever thing you've done

So justify the reason to kill
I bet you will
Fooling no one but yourself
I wish you will

Oh, what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well, I know you well

Actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
I'll have to notice your actions & motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just don't get it
How you managed to justify who dies
Like judge and jury
You're the very one who crucifies

Don't get your hands dirty to kill
Use someone else
Know all your lies are measured in hell
I wish you well

Oh, what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well, I know you well

Actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
I'll have to notice your actions & motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
You can't bleed out

Actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
I'll have to notice your actions & motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
