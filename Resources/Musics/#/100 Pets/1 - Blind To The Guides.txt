BLIND TO THE GUIDES

Too late this moment has arrived 
one into two how will you decide 
forget that you ever had noticed 
did you notice trouble will never be forgotten 
asking of you what will I do 
ask what you will of your own time 

Too late a clean slate would be nice 
blind to the guides I lost along the way 
show me another of your actions 
fractured lines amplify time could venture 
ask what you will of your own mind 
asking of you what it will do
