THREE FRIENDS

In the way that you help us youre not asking for more 
can I see your collection in boxes on the floor 
its only really your words and mind that matter to me now 
our connection in time did end there, goodbye 

I have seen three close friends, the day remanis with me 

In the way that you reason youre not asking for more 
your trouble here unspoken you are double that you seem 
you practice your reaction so well I could hardly be sure 
our connection in time did end there, goodbye 

I have seen three close friends, the day remains with me
