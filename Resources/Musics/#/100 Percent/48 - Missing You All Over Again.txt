MISSING YOU ALL OVER AGAIN

Here I go again
Missin you all over again
Thinkin and dreamin about you
When I should be thinkin about the things I should be doin
but why should I care when I'm thinkin about you

Chours

I'm sittin here thinkin and dreamin about you
Missing you all over again
Living on my own again is so different from when I was livin with you

I got a man now that I'm in love with but I'm sittin here thinkin and dreamin about you
Missing you all over again
Loving you all my life I can never forget the way you looked into my eyes

Here I go again
Missing you all over again

Back to Chorus
