LIFE ON THE LINE

-Spoken-
-Ladies ands gentlemen
LETZ GET READY TO RUMBLE-

-Strong voice-
-Put your Dukes up son
ive got nothing to lose
Im wasting my time
Cause im gonna kill you!-

Listen up theres a fight in the parking lot
theres a kid giving all hes got
6'3 cannons as arms well that what hes not
you've got a 5'8 weak kid giving all hes got(whoooooa)
bubbas got nothing to lose
6'3 cannons as arms might as well just a noose
cause that kid has no chance
hes putting his life on the line
cause he wouldnt give up a fucking dime!

Go on kid start the fight
you know your life is on the line
give it all you got never ever stop
people have money on the fight
looks like your mom is the only one on your side

circleing around the two
everybody is anxious to see how bad the boy
will be killed
first punch passed and gone
looks like the boy ducked so bubba hit his mom
the boy ducked didnt think twice
crack into bubbas family jewels
oooooooooo as the crowd sounds so cool
next bubba grabs a tool
from his red pick-up looks like a hammer
the kids gonna get fucked up
but look what he sees
the kid has a bat ready to give the first whack
Swing 1! missed...bubba sliced the boys arm
Swing 2! ooooo right at bubbas knee
Swing 3! Bubba getz hit IN THE FUCKING FACE

Go on kid start the fight
you know your life is on the line
give it all you got never ever stop
people have money on the fight
looks like your mom is the only one on your side

Little guy you prooved them all....wrong
in the end you came out....strong

the lil boy searches the bloody guys pockets
walks away scratching his sack telling everyone
"Hey at least i got my dime back"
