GHOST

We're all ghosts living in a ghost world
And to all of you I'm just another ghost dude
Floating along haunting pointlessly
Seems everyone is haunting something but me

Everyone is haunting me
Even I'm haunting me
But when I take off my white sheet
It's then I become unseen

I'm exposed without the blindfold of lies
Because those two holes are too small for human eyes
And I'll walk, not float to oblivion
Because that's who I am, not for the nation

Everyone is haunting me
Even I'm haunting me
But when I take off my white sheet
It's then I become unseen
