LIFE IN THE SUBURBS

Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems

Now my dad bought the system, American dreamer
Bought a new home and a brand new Beamer
But it didn't long for things things to fall apart
Because the system that he bought has no heart
From the bills for days hes got blood shot eyes
The American dream was a pack of lies
6 months later Municipal court
Divorce time baby, child support
I went from home cooked meals to TV dinners
No more little Mike now its the punk,the sinner
There's no cash back cause there was no receipt
Man suburban life aint the life for me

Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems

Gave in a little deeper to the third degree
More drugs, real punks, and wannabe's
Soldiers of the burbs all feel deceived
America! What? Land of the green
Now you got problems I got mine too
There's not enough cops for my whole crew
Cause when we drink we drink to get away
To elevate from this world of hate, never perpetrate
I don't want no degree selling herbs on the burbs
On every street
No real jobs for the PTB, So what's it gonna be?
Grand minority!

Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems

Now broken homes inside every house
Neighbors yellinh, can't work it out
I said beaten wives, tweaked out nights
what a feeling ooh what a life
Now you cant turn back the hands of time
So let me tell you about the highest friend of mine
His name is Greg, king of the crops
deep dark axe,hates all preps
Philly blunt placed behind his ear
Two young girls and a Heineken beer
And this is just and everyday thing
Dad comes home telephone rings
Its lenny and you know hes riding rich
Leapin' like some frogs trunk full of hogs
Trunk full of skates, dirt bikes and rakes
What ever we could get we was gonna take
Just like the pirates of the Caribbean
Neighborhood watch don't like what they're seeing
Ha ha ha we got it like that
snatching surfboard racks!

Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
