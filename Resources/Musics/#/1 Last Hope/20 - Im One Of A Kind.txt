IM ONE OF A KIND

I drive up to our school
Your friends all look so cool
Hanging by the bleachers
Your friends all stop and stare
At my spikey hair
And at my punk rock t-shirts

You are the girl for me only you can`t see me
Your eyes are not open
I am one of a kind and you`ll never find
A guy who will love you more

I see you in the hall
I trip and then I fall
And you just stand there laughing
It wouldn`t hurt so bad
If you only had
Offered to help me up

You are the girl for me only you can`t see me
Your eyes are not open
I am one of a kind and you`ll never find
A guy who will love you more

Maybe someday you will see
Just how wonderful
Our relationship could be
If you`d only give me a chance

I sneak up to your house
As quiet as a mouse
Hoping that you don`t hear me
I peek in your window
It`s funny you don`t know
That I can see you changing

You are the girl for me only you can`t see me
Your eyes are not open
I am one of a kind and you`ll never find
A guy who will love you more
