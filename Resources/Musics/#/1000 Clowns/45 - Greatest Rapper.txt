GREATEST RAPPER

Not the Greatest Rapper
I wanna be down, yo, will you let me?
I get real close, I kiss her face real gently.
Don't sweat me girl your everything I ever needed
And when I'm with you, my heart starts to bleed
I plead and plead and plead and plead for a little kiss
And if you say "okay" I just got my wish
On the town the night will be just right
I hold your hand but I won't squeeze too tight.
I feed you food that you've never eaten
I think about it and my heart starts beating
I look at you and it nearly wrecks me
I never met a girl who was so damn sexy!
A week later and some daisies after,
You get a postcard from this silly rapper
And it says I'll be knocking on your front door,
Cuz I've never loved a girl like this before!I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But please baby, please baby be my girl.
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in this land
But I'll do anything if you'll hold my hand.I pick her up and its raining heavy
I meet her mom, I say my name is Kevi
I'm so dizzy when I'm with your daughter
But I treat her right, I never cross no border
We get in the car, I say "Ya want some music?"
She says "Okay."
So I say "You choose it."
Straight out the purse comes 1000 Clowns, and I say "Oh, God. I know my girl is down."
We go away for the cozy vacation
Santa Barbara is our destination.
Halfway on our way I start to feel real ready
I pull the car over "Will you be my steady?"
She says "Okay."
And my heart gets swollen
It feels so damn good to even take her bowling
Now she knows I'll be knocking on her front door
Cuz I've never loved a girl like this before.I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But please baby, please baby be my girl.
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in this land
But I'll do anything if you'll hold my hand.Would ya be my sunshine?
Would ya be all mine?
{Okay}
(Repeat 3 times)We're still together, we hang out all the time
She comes to the shows when I bust a rhyme
She never minds that my friends keep me late
She's cool like that, she'll kick back and wait.
Never hesitate to hold my hand, whispers in my ear,
"Kevi you're my man."
See, thats the plan, now there's no more adore
I've never loved a girl like this before.I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But please baby, please baby be my girl.
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in this land
But I'll do anything if you'll hold my hand.
