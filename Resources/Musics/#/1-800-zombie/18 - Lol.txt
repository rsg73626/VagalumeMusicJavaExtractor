LOL

Wake up in the morning and jump out of bed
I got this crazy urge; can't get it out of my head
I've got to go on Myspace and check my comments
And maybe if I'm lucky, I'll have some friend requests
And I'm not surprised that I have quite a few
You want me to add you band, no I won't add you
Your music is generic and the screaming is the same
As the band who asked me yesterday; 

I thought that they were lame
I check up on my comments and most of them say hi
So I go to their page and post a funny reply
I see today is friday, you know what that means
I get to go to the mall and show everyone I'm scene
I'll even dye my hair for them so that it's at its best
And I wore my tightest pants and my dino on my chest
They'll come right up to me and ask if I'm on Myspace
Hell yes I am girl, did you tell from my face?

But I don't remember yours, I have ten thousand friends
I can't remember who's on my list, your probably at the end
Everyone comes up to me and asks for my autograph
'Cause you know 1-800-Zombie
It's so famous, it makes me want to laugh
