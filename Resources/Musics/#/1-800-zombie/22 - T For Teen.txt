T FOR TEEN

Come on, baby, get it started
Turn that switch, you stupid bitch
The power button- it is somethin' that I like to hit
It's kinda sick, but baby don't you get it
I want to be hitched, you're the one I've always wanted
I just hope my controller fits

Nintendo 64, you're the one that I adore
But you will always be my baby and my first kinda score
But you know me baby, I'm always shoppin' around for more
'Cause everbody knows that I'm a Nintendo whore
