JOLT YR NUTS

Drinkin', drinkin' Jolt all night
Helpin' me keep on the light
Playin' my Nintendo
But I have my Mario
And I have my little Toad
They will keep me company
When I play them on TV

I beat the bosses on each level
And now it's your turn to settle
Bowser you can suck my dick
After I poke you with a stick
I will stay up all night
Just so I can win this fight
But that cola's goin' down
It's makin' me dance around
Jolt is kickin' in alright
I might have to pause this fight
Up, right, down, down, side to side
Jolt is goin' to win this fight
