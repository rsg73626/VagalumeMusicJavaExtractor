HIS FATHER'S SON

His father's son is now a man.
Before he stands a stranger in his eyes.
Through his life he never lent a hand.
Where does he stand in his only sons mind?
Where were you when we needed you the most?
You disappeared you coward.
Hide your head in shame.
You did no wrong?
You tried your best?
WELL YOU LIE!!!
You destroyed all she had ever worked for.
What have you done?
Look what you made.
Thanks for the pain I will take to the grave.
You must know but this time I never needed
You, must must know through the years I never needed
You, can see from my face I never needed...
How does it feel to have your honor shamed?
I know the feeling well.
I've felt the pain.
Another life you let your seed and died.
Now you're gone, never to return.
I see the way you hold the children these days.
No ties to them - the ease throw your past away.
I won't forget these scars you planted in my mind.
You will never hold my first-born.
What have you done?
Look what you made.
Thanks for the pain I will take to the grave.
You must know but this time I never needed
You, must must know through the years I never needed
You, can see from my face I never needed...
