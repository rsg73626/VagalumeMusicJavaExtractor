HOW CAN I FORGET

i guess it's been a year or two or three
i let myself forget who i'm supposed to be
lived for myself no matter what was said or done
didn't give a fuck if i offended everyone
another day still living in the gutter
i never doubt i'm better than the others
my actions prove me wrong every fucking day
just watch me contradict every word i say
i can't kick these drugs they're still kicking me
if i could leave it behind who the fuck would i be
defined myself for years by the rules i broke
another drink and i'll forget
if i can't remember how can i regret
another pill and i'll forget
if i can't remember how can i regret
another bundle and i'll forget
if i can't remember how can i regret
