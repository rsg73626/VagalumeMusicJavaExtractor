HARD SURPRISE

i'm killing myself slowly
way too fucking slow
you never see my weakness
i never let it show
buried so deep inside me
i can't remember where
on my way straight to hell
and i'll wait for you there
where can i find the answers
i've looked everywhere
drugs, religion, sin and penance
i've tried them all they're not the cure
i've been beaten down by life
but i'me still fighting abck
i want to die with dignity
keep your tears i'm on track
destined to go nowhere
determined to get there first
where can i find the answers
i've looked everywhere
drugs, religion, sin and penace
i've tried them all they're not the cure
