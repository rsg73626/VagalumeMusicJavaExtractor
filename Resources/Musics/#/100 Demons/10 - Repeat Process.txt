REPEAT PROCESS

This was the time, the only time I thought that it would all work out.
Make a believer of myself without a doubt.
I made a pact.
I swore and swore and swore again.
But here I stand.
Rage unbridled.
Not what I used to be.
Pain so vital, it's necessary.
My dear I'm so sorry.
I can't control myself.
It's real, no story.
I am broken again.
Through the times that I kept myself in control.
Oh! I felt free, free from all the fear that was controlling me.
It was only just a whisper form my breath.
It has returned and so I wait for the...
Rage unbridled.
Not what I used to be.
Pain so vital, it's necessary.
My dear I'm so sorry.
I can't control myself.
It's real, no story.
I am broken again.
My only love I throw away.
Turned into coal now as she lays.
I dig this hole.
I've lost my way.
Rage unbridled.
Not what I used to be.
Pain so vital, it's necessary.
My dear I'm so sorry.
I can't control myself.
It's real, no story.
I am broken again.
