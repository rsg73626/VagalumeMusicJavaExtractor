SUFFER

my hatred is unstoppable
and death for you will be so slow
your sins are unforgivable
and your god can't save you now
i'll be your judge and jury
sometimes justice moves to slow
and i will show you no mercy
when i drop the final blow
too many times you fucked me over
too many times i believed your shit
i smell your fear and weakness
and it makes me fucking sick
i know you heard my cries
saw the faith in my eyes
then you turned your back on me
made me suffer alone
