WAKE UP AND HATE

wake up and hate - another day in paradise
i don't think i've been happy - more than twice in my life
the first time i fucked - the first time i got high
i think there was a third - the first time i saw a man die
and underneath my anger - all i feel is hate
don't want to hear you're sorry - cus it's too fucking late
you tell me to follow my heart - my hearts an empty shell
you tell me to swallow my pride - fuck you and go to hell
you havn't been where i've been - so you'll never understand
i'm just trying to survive - i'll do it anyway i can
and underneath my anger - all i feel is hate
don't want to hear you're sorry - cuz it's too fucking late
too little way too fucking late
every breathing moment filled with hate
