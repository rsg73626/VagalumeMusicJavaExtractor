SO WRONG SO LONG

So tell me why you're here,
Do you still hold me dear?
When you're the one that walked away from me but that's okay,
Did you think all this through?
I thought about it too,
But I can't waste my life away on love that isn't true.

Are you still holding on?
When I did I was wrong,
To think you'd ever take another chance of losing me.
So now where do we stand?
You say that I'm your man,
But you won't tell me everything,
And I don't think you can.

I never thought I was anything,
But you showed me I'm wrong,
For that I'll thank you always and always.

Memories of yesterday,
All the things I couldn't say,
To make you understand how I feel now,
And time is moving way too fast to sit and contemplate the past again,
But I'll thank you always!
GO

I never thought I was anything,
But you showed me I'm wrong,
For that I'll thank you always and always.
Always, and I'll thank you always.
Always, and I'll thank you always
