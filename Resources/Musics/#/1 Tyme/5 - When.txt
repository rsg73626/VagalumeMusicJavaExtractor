WHEN

When i was young, half forgotten the ol' times never the same
My daddy took me fish in high horse ridin i had to say good bye

This is when times were good and bad i shared my dreams
Shining half atime ago. as time passed i lost it all
Memories gone,until i find the one man i love some day soon,

Passion is tough lovin decide when to love to find the one the one to hold close
It aint so easy to find some body to lay by your side.

When ooh ooh when ooh ooh when someday when till then.
