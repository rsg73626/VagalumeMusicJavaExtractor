ARIZONA

Oh yes she’s gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
Yes, she’s gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
She’s got a friend
Yes, a real pretty friend
But she’s gone to Arizona
Took my money and ran
Oh yes she’s gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
Yes she’s gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
I’ve got a gun, it’s a black shiny gun
Yeah I’ve got a gun, it’s a black shiny gun
Well I’ve been doin’ some thinking
Thinkin’ it’s a good thing she’s gone so far
I feel Arizona rising
I feel the devil’s on the run
I feel Arizona rising
Look out ladies here I come!
All’s fair in love and war
But this is business Baby!
Oh yes she’s gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
Yes she’s gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
I’ve got a gun, it’s a black shiny gun
Yeah I’ve got a gun, it’s a black shiny gun
Well I’ve been doin’ some thinking
Thinkin’ it’s a good thing she’s gone so far
I feel Arizona rising
I feel the devil’s on the run
I feel Arizona rising
Look out ladies here I come!
