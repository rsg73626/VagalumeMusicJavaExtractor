SWEETFACE

Drink, to your death, to your death
Well, I’ll be impressed
And smoke, till you die, till you die
I’ll be there watching
And crash, your fancy car, your fancy car
I hope the pavement stops your heart

And what, did you think, did you think
Tell me, what were you thinking
Now look, at this mess, at this mess
Well I’m so impressed
And slip, from this world, from this world
You’ll be sincerely missed
But not by me, no not by me, no not by me
I don’t mind, I don’t mind

No not by me, no not by me, no not by me
I don’t mind, I don’t mind
So drink, to your death, to your death
Well i’ll be impressed
And smoke, till you die, till you die
I’ll be there watching
And crash, your fuckign car, your fucking car
I hope the pavement stops your heart
