SHOCK AND  FRIGHT

Shock and fright
All the creatures of the night
Are coming after me
And I’m running, running, running
Can’t you see
From these things that are coming after me-e-e-e

Bill collectors
Tax inspectors
Parking enforcement
has got the government endorsement
to take my money away from me

Shock and fright
All the creatures of the night
Are coming after me
And I’m running, running, running
Can’t you see
From these things that are coming after me-e-e-e

My ex-girlfriend
And her new boyfriend
And his Mercedes-Benz
She calls me lazy
So what?
I’m happy this way

Presidents,
Dead presidents
And the residents
At my apartment complex
Complain about all the loud sex
but they just don’t know
I’m alone and watching porn

Oh shock and fright
All the creatures of the night
Are running after me
All this running is getting tiring
For a guy that’s lazy like me

Think I just might
Join the other side
It’s an easy life
Be a monster
Such a comfy old bed tonight

Bill collectors
Tax inspectors
Presidents,
Residents
And old dead friends

Bill collectors
Tax inspectors
Presidents,
Residents
And old dead friends

Bill collectors
Tax inspectors
Presidents,
Residents
And old dead friends

Bill collectors
Tax inspectors
Presidents,
Residents
And old dead friends
