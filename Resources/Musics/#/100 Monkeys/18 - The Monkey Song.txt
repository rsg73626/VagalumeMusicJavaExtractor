THE MONKEY SONG

I wish I was a monkey
I?d sleep in the trees
I?d do my best to imitate the man
Who does his best not to imitate me

You know I?d have thumbs just like a man
But none of the obligations
Yeah everything I?m tied to now would be gone
Gone gone gone gone gone

I?d like to be a monkey
Be monkey?s with you
Cause I?m a monkey by myself
With a lot of shit to do
I?d like to be a monkey
Be monkey?s with you
Cause I?m a monkey by myself

I?m in trouble with my family
I?m in trouble with the law
I?m in trouble finacially
I guess you could say I get in trouble a lot

I?ve danced frantically in passion
Layed motionless in apathy
But all I wanna do is swing in a tree

Away from the agony of love
And sex and drugs
Of love,and sex and drugs
Of love,and sex and drugs
And all
And all of the lack there of?s

I?d like to be a monkey
Be monkey?s with you
Cause I?m a monkey by myself
With a lot of shit to do
I?d like to be a monkey
Be monkey?s with you
Cause I?m a monkey by myself

Getting funky now
If I was a monkey
I?d be very very funky
An abundance of banana?s
Monkey bitches and a skunky
Big wet eyes, and a big wet ass
Chillin in my monkey bungalow
Made of sticks and grass

The monkey life is the life for me
Not a pirate or an MC
MC spider monkey
The fly white honkey
The king of the jungle
The pimp in the palm trees
Dipin, sipin on coconut wine
Blingin out my rings
Bustin out my rhymes
Crusien in my pint-sized escalade
Smokin philly blunts in the shades

Monkey got it made
This monkey got it made
Yeah this monkey?s got it made
Yeah this monkey?s got it made
Yeah this monkey?s got it made
Yeah this monkey?s got it made
