JUNKIE

Ever since you left me
My clothes don't seem to fit
The beers are always empty
I've quit trying to quit
Smoking my cigarettes
Ever since you left

Ever since you walked out my door
The bills keep piling up
It's not as if I can't afford
The money--I have enough
I just give in
I don't care enough

All my family worry about me
All my friends they worry about me
What have I done for them to doubt me

It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love

Ever since you left me
I won't pick up the phone
Every single time I do
Someone asks me if you're home
And I have to say no
They have to ask, where did you go

[FIDDLE SOLO]

The last time that I slept with you
Was the last time I slept
I lie awake with every other girl
Wondering if you wept
After you left
If only after you left

All my family worry about me
All my friends they worry about me
What have I done for them to doubt me

It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
