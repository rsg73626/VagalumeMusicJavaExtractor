POISON OAK

[Poison Oak]
Your poison, your poison oak
See how far your roots have grown
You plant the seeds of war
You plant the seeds hate
You plant the seeds of love
You cant appreciate

Poison poison poison oak
You reap what you sow
See how your roots have grown
Into the soil of that first dawn
Creating the garden of eden
Adam and Eve
Well they had to leave
Well they had to eat

Your poison oak

Oh oh oh my tattered soul
Oh oh oh my tattered soul
There are places you don?t wanna go
There are things you don?t wanna know

Oh oh oh my tattered soul
Oh oh oh my tattered soul
There are places you don?t
You don?t wanna go

Poison poison poison oak
You reap what you sow
You reap the seeds of war
You reap the seeds hate
You reap the seeds of love
You can?t appreciate
You reap the seeds denial
You reap the seeds of the child
You reap the seed of the child
Hey hey?..

Oh oh oh my tattered soul
Oh oh oh my tattered soul
Oh oh oh my tattered soul
There are places you don?t wanna go

Oh oh oh my tattered soul
Oh oh oh my tattered soul
There are things you don?t
You don?t wanna know
