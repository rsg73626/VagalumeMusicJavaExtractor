REAPER

(a 1, a 2, a wahahahaha)

The Reaper inside of me
Creeping oh so quietly
A sleeper cell in time of peace
Sitting on its tendencies

For acting out so violently
A violent, silent tide at sea
Then Red October suddenly
Yeah free the beast

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Said free free free the beast
Pound your feet, give it a treat
YA!

Well its the Reaper inside of me
Writhing absent mindedly
Masochistic fashion suits me nicely
Boozing now, days and nightly

Its unsightly this side of me
Biting on this binding
I've been losing my teeth in all my dreams
I just need sweet release

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Said free free free the beast
Pound your feet, give it a treat
YA!

Chewin my tongue for far too long
My jaw is starting to ache
I can taste my blood
My face feels rough
Which is odd cause I just shaved

La la la la la la la la
La la la la LA LA LA
La la la la la la la la
La la la la LA LA LA

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Free free free the beast
Pound your feet, give it a treat

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Free free free the beast
Pound your feet, give it a treat
