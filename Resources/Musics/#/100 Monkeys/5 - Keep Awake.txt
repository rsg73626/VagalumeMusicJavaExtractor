KEEP AWAKE

And your right toe twitchin’
Coz I’m in the kitchen
With the knife that’s itchin’
For your red blood
On those white sheets


So Keep your left eye open
And your right toe twitchin’
Coz I’m in the kitchen
With the knife that’s itchin’
For your red blood
On those white sheets

I will kill you in your sleep
So you better try, try and keep awake
I will kill you in your sleep
So you better try, try and keep awake
I will kill you in your sleep
So you better try, try and keep awake
I will kill you in your sleep
So you better try, try and keep awake
