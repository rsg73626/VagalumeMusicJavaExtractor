SMALL LEAN

Jesse Camp, Jesse Camp used to be a tv star.
Jesse Camp, Jesse Camp is now a homeless guy living out of his car.
you might see him around on the street
he sure looks the same to me
but he's no longer on the mtv
he's in the cubicle next to me
Jesse, how'd you come to be
sitting next to me, in this cubicle
you used to be a tv star
now you're living in your car (I never even heard your album, I never even saw you on tv)
except, you're a hero to me,
and a pretty nice guy
even though you seem kind of shy
you make a good pot of coffee
you've got a nice smile, when you're stoned
you used to be a tv star but now you're living in your car
I watched you on tv but now you're sitting in the cubicle next to me
