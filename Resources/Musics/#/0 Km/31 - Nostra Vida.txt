NOSTRA VIDA

Manic depression, your mind's a blank
Ready and waiting to die
No future, your life's a waste
Which method of suicide to try?
Hanging is quick and easy
No mess and no blood to see
Slashed wrists, no reverse
Which way will it be?

[Chorus:]
Suicide, you'll take your life
Death comes so quick
Suicide, you're on your own
With your life you are sick

Drowning takes its time
You might try to survive
Gassing, slow and cold
Sickness before you die
O.D., slow torment
Torture and pain will increase
Injection, instant death
A second and you are deceased

[Chorus]

You've chosen injection
Needle pierces the skin
Venom flows, it's now too late
A voice screams out from within
A wasted life, a wasted brain
Diseased cells called for the kill
You're on your way to Hell's black gate
Suicide beats life's will

[Repeat first verse]
