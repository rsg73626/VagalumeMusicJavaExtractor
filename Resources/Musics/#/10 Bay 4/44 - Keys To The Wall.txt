KEYS TO THE WALL

Even as a little child,
I held it all inside.
All the things that make me angry,
Put inside and carried it with me.

Conscience, yes, that he had
Didn't fit his scrawny body.
No room for the confidence,
Which he struggled to understand.
Come on.

Should I believe, I believe, I believe?
Yeah
Should I believe, I believe, I believe?
Yeah

Confused, he began to question,
"What is it that I believe in?"
No reward for the path less chosen,
Where he was he had no place.

He learned everything the hard way;
Wouldn't give it a second chance.
His heartache full of sorrow,
Longing for what he never had.
Come on.

Should I believe, I believe, I believe?
Yeah.
Should I believe, I believe, I believe?
Yeah.

Hate all these problems in my life.
How sad, but they'll be there all the time.
Hate all these problems in my life.
How sad.

Raised myself a disbeliever,
Tender to my eyes (my eyes).
My passion pursued, my old friend weakness,
Tempted I'd, tempted I'd.

My reply: my reply: my reply:
"All I'm waiting for,
All I'm waiting for,
All I'm waiting for is a little more time.

I've loosened up, but take this life so seriously.

I've loosened up.
Come on.

Yeah.

Yeah.
