SNOWMAN

No words ever exchanged,
But I see the pain remains.

All too far his face is,
When she can't replace this.
She don't know which way to go today.

As rain pours down on me,
'Cause I'm screwed up inside.

I want to be with you, and,
I will spend my life with you.
There are things in my life,
I don't think you'd understand,
Lord. I'm saying,
I want to be with you, and,
I will spend my life with you.
There are things in my life,
I don't think you'd understand,
Lord. How I'm lost...

She screams, "I'm sorry,
But I didn't mean for it to be this way."
She screams, "I'm sorry,"
Said, "I didn't mean... I didn't mean." Yeah...

As rain pours down on me,
'Cause I'm screwed up inside.

I want to be with you, and,
I will spend my life with you.
There are things in my life,
I don't think you'd understand,
Lord. I'm saying,
I want to be with you, and
I will spend my life with you.
There are things in my life,
I don't think you'd understand,
Lord.
As rain pours down on,
As rain pours down on,
'Cause I'm screwed up inside
Yeah...
