SCARED, BUT NOT THAT SCARED

So, you got your head shaved
My knees weaken when your legs get splayed
Everybody run, everybody hide
I gotta struggle just to keep it from my mind
And I'm scared, but not that scared
Yeah I'm scared, but not that scared
I'm scared, but not that scared
And all that leave's the change

Go and meet at, bay
It's on the love that you will not get laid
Everybody run, everybody hide
I gotta hustle when I see it in the sky
And I'm scared, but not that scared
Yeah I'm scared, but not that scared
I'm scared, but not that scared
And all that leave's the change

Half the trees will never green
And all the, was grey
And all the seas have fled the sky
The bonds, away
And I'm scared, but not that scared
Yeah I'm scared, but not that scared
I'm scared, but not that scared
And all that leave's the change

Scared but not that scared
Scared but not that scared
Scared but not that scared
All that leave's the change

Scared but not that scared
Scared but not that scared
Scared but not that scared
All that leave's the change
Only the change, only the change
