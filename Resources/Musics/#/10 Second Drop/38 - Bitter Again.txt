BITTER AGAIN

Tell me when will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that i do
Leave me bitter again

Hold you in the darkness
Lead you like you're blind
I gave you all you wanted
Thats the bottom line

I tried to make it
I tried to fake it
Searched for the meaning
So self-defeated

Tell me when will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that i do
Leave me bitter again

Sometimes i think
That my only friend
Is this feeling i feel
When i'm bitter, bitter again

I made it all so easy
To let me suffocate
But you can rape the willing
Madness i create

I tried to make it
I couldn't take it
Can't fight the feeling
And i'm still reeling

Tell me when will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that i do
Leave me bitter again

Sometimes i think
That my only friend
Is this feeling i feel
When i'm bitter, bitter again

Bitter again

Yeah, yeah

I tried to make it
I couldn't take it
I tried to fake it
But i'm done

When will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that i do
Leave me bitter again

Sometimes i think
That my only friend
Is this feeling i feel
When i'm bitter, bitter again

Yeah, yeah
Bitter again
Yeah, yeah
Bitter again x4
