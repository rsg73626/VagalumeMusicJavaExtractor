FLY IN THE DAY

Please my sister mercy 
But the sky lost your way 
I never wanted song 
In the bitch and white cocaine 
I can't feel my soul 
I can't feel my baby in bed 
She walk in the rain 
And she eat piece of me 

Living in the cell 
I was growing for my back 
I see the pretty girls 
In the great holy land 
The virgin pray 
The virgin pray 
My fingers in your body 

And the devil in myself 
And I fly if you touch my hand 
My best day in the sexy hotel 
When the morning I want forget 
And I started now 

Please my sister mercy 
Please my sister mercy 
I never wanted song 
I never wanted song 
She walk in the rain
She walk in the rain
I can't feel my soul 
I can't feel my soul 

I see the Jesus down, she said 
Dreams the little man you pray 
Something break the mind, my words 
Read the mirror call the world 

And I fly if you touch my hand 
My best day in the sexy hotel 
When the morning I want forget 
And I started now
