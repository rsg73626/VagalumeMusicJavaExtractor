BASIC WOMAN

One love in a vinyl woman, never could-a could-a be a love.
One love in a sexy lover, should-a should-a should-a be your drug

One night with an easy women, money money if you wanna sex
One line of the cheaper dealer, sure sure could-a be you death

I wanna a basic woman,
Wanna see you make me roll

I need it,
If I go down
Divine addiction
Sucking devil lines

I need it
I feel stray
Adverse reaction,
Slave, slave, slave….

I wanna a basic woman,
Wanna see you make me roll
I wanna a basic woman,
Wanna see you feelin´hot

I need it,
If I go down
Divine addiction
Sucking devil lines

I need it
I feel stray
Adverse reaction,
Slave, slave, slave….
