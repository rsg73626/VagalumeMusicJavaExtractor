LIES

Now you know my lies,
You are feeling my stories
But you are too blind
To see my dark emotions,

But, I know, I know, I know, I know your secrets
I know you are feeling hot inside,
I know, I know, I know your secrets
I know, you are sick, you are burning inside.

Let me touch your skin
Living cool confusion
Like an orgy dream
When one is all and all is one.

But, I know, I know, I know, I know your secrets
I know you are feeling hot inside,
I know, I know, I know your secrets
I know, you are sick, you are burning inside.

RAP:

And you know my dark side, you know my skin,
My burning sex, my fuckinÂ´bitch,
Stolen night in stolen life
The flesh I have, still inside.

Now I now your lies
To see your dark emotions

But, I know, I know, I know, I know your secrets
I know you are feeling hot inside,
I know, I know, I know your secrets
I know, you are sick, you are burning inside.
