JUST COME

Today is the day when i coming in flesh
I wanna be your guest in your table in your bed
& i open my beast & i open your lips on my list i insist in your breast i resist.

Crossing & turning i fuckinÂ´your trading
I make it with class & i take it so hot
& i checking your past, i want your lust, lust of the inferno, i breaking your stereo.

Come my lover, baby just come.

Record & forward i melt your comma
Beware of the dragon he barking in retro
Babe can you hear me, the movie beginning, your step in the metro i sign your electro.

Come my lover, baby just come.
