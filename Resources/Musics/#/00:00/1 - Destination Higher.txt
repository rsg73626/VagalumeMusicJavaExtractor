DESTINATION HIGHER

I don`t know where I am going
but I`ll go to the right side
If I`m stucked I won`t finally know
what means to be mine

Taking me above
destinations higher
Improving soul
Desntinations higher

I don`t know where I am going
but I`ll go to the right side
If I`m stucked I won`t finally know
what means to be mine

wish I`ve already found a place
Where my soul won`t screwed
We made our own lies and
We loose the perfect view (wich)

Takes me above
destinations higher
Improving soul
Desntinations higher.
