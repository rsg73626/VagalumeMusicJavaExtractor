HOPE

Hope

When i look into your eyes
I can see your real face
Like a fire in the dark
Showing and bringing my way
When the stars  shine higher
Where my dream will become true
There Will be the best time
To spoon what we planted

When i look into you eyes
I can see your real face
Wait  a hands to help your lives
No one seems to care
When the stars shine higher
Where my dream will become true
There Will be the best time
To sp0on what we planted

Believe in better  times
Together we can try

To get hope
Everybody, what do you think for me to get higher
Tell me what you need to live in peace right now
To get hope
Everybody, what do you think for me to get higher
Tell me what you need to live in peace right now
To get hope
Everybody, what do you think for me to get higher
Tell me what you need to live in peace right now
