MULLET GIRL

I don't know her name
not a thing about her
all i know is that she's got a big fat mullet
don't know what goes on inside her head
not a clue
i just hope she doesn't try to cut it
oh yeah i'm in love with her hair
she could be anyone
i don't even care
when i see her hair
my eyes automatically stare
watching the eighth wonder of the world
and i guess this is fate
another day i have to wait
until i see that doo
oh yeah i'm in love with her hair
she could be anyone
i just don't even care
and i know its getting rough
she's coming down with a bad case of dandruff
