LITTLE DARLIN

You watched us in the night
Mamma Lorraine

You made the darkness bright
Mamma Lorraine

There was no sad tomorrow though we had no dime -
You'll stay in my heart till the end of the time.
Goodbye
i will keep you in my heart

Allright
oh Mama
we had to part.
So long
till the day we'll meet again

So long
My Love
Mamma Lorraine.
You kissed' away my tears
Mamma Lorraine

You helped me all the years
Mamma Lorraine

The end of your journey
you took your leave -
This song is for you
and is all I can give.
Goodbye
I will keep you in my heart
. . .
The bell is ringin'
singin'
all night long

I hear you softly whisper in my song.
Goodbye
I will keep you in my heart
. . .
Goodbye
I will keep you in my heart
. . .
