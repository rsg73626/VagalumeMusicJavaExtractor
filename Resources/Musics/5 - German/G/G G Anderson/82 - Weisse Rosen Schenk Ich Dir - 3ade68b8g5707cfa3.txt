WEISSE ROSEN SCHENK ICH DIR

I've been alone for too long
I've been alone for too long
Did you want me to just welcome you
With open arms
Did you want me to fall at your feet
Falling for your charms

I've been alone for too long
I've been alone for too long
Always looking out for rainbows
That's how I lived my life
Always searching for rainbows
Cos I want colour in my life

You've been away for far too long
And I've been alone for too long
I've been chasing your picture
Around the corners of my mind
But you keep getting farther
Farther every time

Everyday I travel, travel in time
try my best to reach you
I just don't know what I'll find
Everuday I travel
Everyday you lie
Everuday it's harder
Harder to forgive

You've been away for too long
I've been alone for too long
Looking out for shadows
thinking of you
Chasing after shadows
What am I supposed to do

I've been alone for too long
I've been alone for too long
Did you want me to just welcome you
with open arms
Did you want me to fall at your feet
Falling for your charms
I've been alone for too long
I've been alone for too long
