BON VOYAGE (FEAT. BEENZINO)

Where to go
Where to go
Where to go
Fly away girl, bon voyage

As if I'm possessed by something
I hold your hand
And I keep annoying you

Do you want to be irresponsible today
Pushing back all the work we need to do
And run away with me somewhere?

Right this moment
Outside my clear window
This picturesque weather is unbelievable

So baby let's go play outside
The only thing you need is a pair of sunglasses
Just you and me, you and me, and this good weather

Our sweet holiday
The sky and the sun are warm today
Our sweet holiday
There is so much to do today

When we pass by a nice cafe
The slight aroma of coffee provokes our noses

I chose a latte
My baby, what do you want?
How about a dark americano?

As I hold your hand, which is warmer than the paper cup
And I walk on this street, my smile stretches so big

So baby let's go play outside
The only thing you need is a pair of sunglasses
Just you and me, you and me, and this good weather

Our sweet holiday
The sky and the sun are warm today
Our sweet holiday
There is so much to do today

Where to go
Where to go
Where to go
Fly away girl, bon voyage

After the cafe, let's go shopping at the mall
Let's take a walk with the sunset at 5pm
When night comes, hot date
Let's take a hot bath in the hot tub
Just thinking about it makes my heart hopping roughly
We can get along, other people's eyes don't matter
Besides you, I've erased everything else from my sight
Baby, I hope you are like me too, maybe

Our sweet holiday
The sky and the sun are warm today
Our sweet holiday
There is so much to do today

Where to go
Where to go
Where to go
Fly away girl, bon voyage
