DANCING ON MY OWN

You know I'm trying to make it happen for us right now

I got to do what I got to do, me and you
I remember we were living like Kings and Queens

In the little tiny castle made of hopes and dreams
It was destiny, meant to be
So complete, the perfect team
And suddenly there's a glitch in the system
And between us is a big strip of distance
They say it supposed to make the heart grow fonder

For more like I can tell it couldn't be wronger
A little bit of more goes a long way
A little bit of right goes the wrong way
I keep giving, you keep taking
I'm trying to make a living be patient

All dressed up nowhere to go
So I'm dancing on my own
I've been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong
But you are not coming
So-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong

But you are not coming home
Listen
I don't want you dancing by yourself
And I don't want you picturing yourself with someone
Else
I know I made some promises and honestly I wanna
Just to work out
I didn't know the shining star I found was 'bout to
Burn out

So what now? We go around like a record
I feelin' disconnected and you're feelin' disrespected
I don't know how this gonna rap up
But till I'm home you should turn that track on
And that's all I get from you
But I give my all to you
And that's all I hear from you

All dressed up nowhere to go
So I'm dancing on my own
I've been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
But you are not coming
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong

But you are not coming home
I always think about her
Try to not overthink about her
I Always dream about her
Try not to dream about her
I feel so lost without her
I try to come home
And it's so hard being out on my own
It breaks my heart to leave you alone

All dressed up nowhere to go
So I'm dancing on my own
I've been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
But you are not coming
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-o-ong
But you are not coming home
