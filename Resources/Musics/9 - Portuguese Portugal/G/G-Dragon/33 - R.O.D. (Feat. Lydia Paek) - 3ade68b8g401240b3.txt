Nega baro nae gippeum

You got me losing my mind
The way you got me fired up
Never give up boy even when they
Try us. You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight

You have my heart like the beat
The way you got me turned up
Never give up boy even when they
Try us. You and me against the world
With you I ride or die tonight
