"D-r-e-a-m"

Kono omoi todokeyou heart to heart, soul to soul
Meguru kisetsu spring storm no you ni gokai
Win big ga motto!!
Some say "Nothin' lasts forever"
Eien no mono wa hatashite aru no darou ka

Sousa oretachi wa kirameku shunkan wo furu ni ikitainda
With all tha love

Hey do you remember? Oboeteru no ka

Towa ni hateru koto ga nai tabiji ni yuruginai wadachi
Osoi kakaru difficulty it's just mayakashi
Toki ni yarusenai tsumi wo okashi...but stick to it
Akuru hi ni wa me wo samashi
Tomo ni ayumu doushi to chikara wakachi atte yume wo kanaero!
Go straight! Shinjiro kono katachi "S.O. triangle"
Trap tobikoe don't forget suishou no yadoru kokoro wo
