MY TERRITORY

[verse 1:]
You niggas square like a doorway
My fan base stretch from CA to Norway
I got it all, cars, hoes, and I got change
Livin like a king, same age as Lebron James
Breakin these hoes wasnt enough so I copped haze
You other guys just mad cuz you not paid
Who wanna rap? Believe I got word play
Ya Boy got more bars than a bird cage
And Im stapped like a seatbelt, see
You want beef? I creep like TLC
Put a couple in they head, make sure they sleep
Cuz most of these dudes hoes, like females be
But I never get caught up in they bitch ways
For the quick pay believe, I flip like a switchblade
Theres no hope for ya
When I put the scope on ya
Take ya lid off like a fuckin can opener
Gangsta gangsta, Ya Boy so hood
Prince of the Bay cuz my flow so good
You a tough dude hangin on the yard with me
Got somethin on my waist Ray Charles could see

[chorus:]
Thats right this is my territory
Watch where you step or get shot while ya tourin
Aint no battle raps, pull the strap on cats while they talkin
Yea boy you could be the next dead man walkin
[x2]
You can run up nigga test ya luck
Them hollow tips gun' mess you up
Vest on my chest, keep a hammer by my nuts
Trust me boy I dont give a fuck
[x2]

[verse 2:]
All these labels know Imma blow like a landmine
Show the whole globe fa sho its SanFran time
They though we was all tye-die shirts
Got the wrong idea boy, try my turf
I seen drugs get sold
Slugs get thrown
Still in the mix like coolaid in punch bowls
Im rich at all times I dont blow my cake
Boy ya money fluxuate, like Oprah weight
Hold it straight
Its a fact while holdin pape
Nine times outta ten friends known to hate
So I roll alone, Im a rollin stone
Somebody call the police, Ya Boy stole the show
And Im not givin it back, Imma hold it ransom
Gangsta raps grandson, hoes say Im handsome
Yes yes its the prince of the fuckin Bay boy
Got my own website in the Escalade boy

[chorus:]
Thats right this is my territory
Watch where you step or get shot while ya tourin
Aint no battle raps, pull the strap on cats while they talkin
Yea boy you could be the next dead man walkin
[x2]
You can run up nigga test ya luck
Them hollow tips gun' mess you up
Vest on my chest, keep a hammer by my nuts
Trust me boy I dont give a fuck
[x2]
