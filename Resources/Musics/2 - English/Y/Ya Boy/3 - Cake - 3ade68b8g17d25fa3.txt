{CAKE}

Ya boy don't play

Before rap I was gettin my {CAKE} off a crack

With a mouth full of diamonds, Giants hat all black
I'm the greatest we can even bet the {CAKE} on dat
Gyea
Boom when I approach the hammer
Get hit with a red beam like the grocery scanner
Paranoid so I filled the whole crib full of planners(?)
I like jewlery but I'm spendin all my{CAKE} on Atlanta(?)
