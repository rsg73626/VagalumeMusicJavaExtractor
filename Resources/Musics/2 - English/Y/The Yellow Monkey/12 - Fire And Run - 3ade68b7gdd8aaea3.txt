FIRE AND RUN

Can't stop feelin' guilty
Don't hate me
The agony hurts badly
Don't hate me
Feel the same - don't throw away
Just feel the same
Fire and run
You've got to believe that it's burning
But sometimes much too strong
Fire and run
It wasn't conceived or revolting
Do i wish, it was undone
Fire and run
Occasion comes along but
Don't hate me
And i've got to go through
Don't hate me
I take the blame - don't go away
It's all a shame
Just
Fire and run
You've got to believe
That it's burning
But sometimes much too strong
Fire and run
It wasn't conceived or revolting
Do i wish it was undone
Fire and run
Fire and run
It's given me pain, it is growing now
Who did i do wrong
Fire and run
A second to split in two words
Will never come along
Fire and run
