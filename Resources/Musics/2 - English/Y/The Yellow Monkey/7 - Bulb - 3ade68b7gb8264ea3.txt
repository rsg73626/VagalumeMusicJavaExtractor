BULB

the smell of your hair, the touch of your hand
the light of our love is warm
like out of a dream, disquieting, the fire of what´s to come

You tell me again and one more time, 
looks like you´re breaking free
maybe you can, in spite of them
I´ll water you everyday

just when the ground is cracked and dry a thunderstorm
The sky breaks open wide, the impossible born 

so hold on baby, take my hand and squeeze it tight until you´re there
when the night is over see what we have done
just like a baby in the womb,
a flower waiting for the sun
given salty water what is gonna come up?

Like a momma´s child, hot as fire and wild, 
red as coals,you are...

heads or tails, to live or to die
it´s that what´s all about?

When the world seems to lack the very ways and means
If you answer the call I´ll give you all you need

So hold on baby, take my hand and squeeze it tight
until you´re there
when the night is over, see what we have done
Just like a baby in the womb
a flower waiting for the sun
Given salty water what is come up.,.. for us..
