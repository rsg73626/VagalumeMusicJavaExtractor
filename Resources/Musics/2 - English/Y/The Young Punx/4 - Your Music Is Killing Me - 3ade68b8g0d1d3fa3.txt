YOUR MUSIC IS KILLING ME

Your music is killing me.
Every note you play is chilling me.
I'm up all night, you're thrilling me,
But I'm going crazy.
I'm in a fever, fever, and I really don't know what to do.
I can't eat, can't sleep, ecos a song can get a hold on you and,
Your beat repeats in my mind like some insanity.
Won't you let me be?

Please help me
I can't get to sleep at night,
With all the songs we're singing going round inside my head
Oh I can't get to sleep at night,
With all the songs we're singing going round inside
It's killing me
