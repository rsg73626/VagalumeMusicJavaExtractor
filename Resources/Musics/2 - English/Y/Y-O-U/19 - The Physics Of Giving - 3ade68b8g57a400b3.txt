THE PHYSICS OF GIVING

With a flashlight,
I could light up the sky
And donate some energy
To the average guy,
But I'm caught up
In my own dark place,
It's cold in a vacuum,
But I need my space
And some time to work things out,
That's all I'm asking for,
All I'm asking for this year,
It's all I'm asking for.

In a windmill,
I could spin all alone,
I'd even save some of that energy
For the folks back at home,
They could use it
To renew lost hope
And bring back the genius
At the end of his rope
In a sailboat waiting for a breeze.

With reactions,
I could split right from wrong,
But that speed-of-light energy
Can't be harnessed for long,
I wanna give it all, all to you,
But it's such heavy stuff,
Don't blame it on gravity,
Because falling in love
Is the hardest fall to take,
But it's all I'm asking for,
All I'm asking for this year,
It's all I'm asking for,
All I'm asking for this year,
It's all I'm asking for,
All I'm asking for this year,
It's all I'm asking for,
All I'm asking for this year.

But I will take what I can get,
I will take what I can get,
Baby, baby, please don't give up me yet,
'Cause I will take what I can get!
