EFFORT

When your thoughts are troubled,
And you can't find any reasons
For the sad things you see,
When the sum of your secrets
Isn't adding up to quite the life
You wanted to lead,
Take a chance on me, babe,
It won't hurt your pride,
This can stay between you & I,
It's worth a try.
It's worth a try.

I would be your Atlas,
If only I could pick you up
And balance your grace,
But if you need direction,
I'll be the first to tell you
You're looking in the wrong place,
If we get lost in a moment,
I might make you laugh,
But you can't be afraid to cry,
That's okay sometimes,
Sometimes,
It's worth a try.
Worth a try.
It's worth a try.
Worth a try.

I've got to head out tomorrow,
And all this talk of effort
Will seem so far away,
But you've always been distant,
So it won't be that much different
Unless you want me to stay,
Take a chance with me, babe,
I won't let you down,
I won't ask you to compromise,
Not tonight,
It's worth a try.
Worth a try.
It's worth a try,
It's worth a try.

With all this comin' & goin'
And goin' & comin'
You should come to your senses.
