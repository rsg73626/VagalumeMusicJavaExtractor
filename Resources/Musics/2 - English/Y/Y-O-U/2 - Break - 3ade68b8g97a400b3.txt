BREAK

He's tired of distractions & meaningless noise,
Tired of answering questions about the methods he employs,
Tired of rebels without a cause & the man they annoy,
When there's slackers in the basement & rejects down the hall,
He's thinking, I need a break from it all.

She's overworked & she's underpaid,
There's a line 'round the corner to see the progress that she made,
She never tried to be different, just worked out that way,
When there's angels in her stairwell & ghosts living in her walls,
She's thinking, I need a break from it all.

It shouldn't feel like such a crime
To wish for a more simple time,
But there's angels in her stairwell & ghosts living in her walls,
She's thinking, I need a break from it all.

Bad news in the papers, every word of it true,
Bills falling out the mailbox, every one overdue,
Every stranger has a crisis, there's only so much you can do,
When you're painted in the corner with your back against the wall,
You're thinking, I need a break from it--

All my enemies were lovers, all my messages are missed,
I need to go undercover, pretend I don't exist,
But I'm painted in the corner with my back against the wall,
And I need a break from it all.

It shouldn't feel like such a crime
To wish for a more simple time,
But I'm painted in this corner with my back against this wall,
And I need a break from it all.

I'm painted in the corner with my back against the wall,
I need a break.
