HONEST MAN

From mountain lakes to dusty valleys,
I carry my secrets for wrong or right,
I'm tired of wandering cold & empty
With no one to share my night,
My mind's playing tricks so cruel,
A mirage, an illusion, 'til there was you.
So I could tell you I could love you like a spy,
But the truth only sounds like a lie.

(Chorus:)
I wouldn't lie to you,
Got nothing to hide from you,
Wherever you are, I'll be beside you,
Because that's where I stand,
I'll be your honest man. (He'll be your honest man.)

I know we come from different places,
Sometimes the distance can seem to much,
But we can put smiles on hopeful faces,
All we have to do is touch,
And these empty towns full of lonely hearts
Suddenly don't feel so far apart,
Where the old way of things no longer applies,
And the truth almost sounds like a lie.

(Chorus)

Take you down to a quiet border,
Where promises hold & whispers swarm,
Watch the stars fall out of order,
Like wishes being born,
The sky is clear & the morning light
Comes across so bright it almost burns your eyes,
It's the place where all good rumors go to die,
And the truth almost sounds like a lie.

(Chorus)

I'll be your honest man. (He'll be your honest man.)
