SECOND CHANCE

She was gone too soon,
Like a second-hand record
By a band that you really love,
And that change I thought was comin'
Wasn't comin' unless somethin'
Caught her like a brand she'd heard of,
She was part of that machine,
Red-handed at the scene,
No acquittal 'cause it fit like a glove,
Velvet ropes 'round her case,
With alarms just in case,
Were a way, she escaped up above.

Now she's runnin' down south
With a song in her mouth,
And when she gets there,
We'll all dance,
Yes, we'll all dance,
And it won't feel nothin' like a second chance,
Ain't nothin' like a second chance.

There was a high school friend
Always caught up in trends
Who was stuck like an unfortunate tattoo,
And the evil stepmother
Who shared only with her brother
The fortune she'd fell into,
Her father thought his daughter
Was an angel 'til he caught her,
Found out all those rumors were true,
She begged them all for forgiveness,
But she knew she'd never live this
Down, givin' those devils their due.

Now she's runnin' down south
With a song in her mouth,
And when she gets there,
We'll all dance,
Yes, we'll all dance,
And it won't feel nothin' like a second chance,
Ain't nothin' like a second chance.

I was third on the list,
And I was quick to insist
That she came in, it would be short & sweet,
She brought a couple 45s,
Brought back memories of drives
That we took before she moved off our street,
We listened all the way through,
Sang the choruses too,
'Bout holdin' hands & the night & the heat,
And when the record started scratchin',
I could tell by her reaction
That night would make my failure complete.

Now we're runnin' down south
With a song in our mouths,
And when we get there,
We'll all dance,
Yes, we'll all dance,
And it won't feel nothin' like a second chance,
Ain't nothin' like a second chance.
