THE CHANGE

My revolution
Begins today,
I'm starting over,
Like a runaway,
One day in the city,
There's so much to do,
I don't wanna miss it,
I don't wanna miss it,
This is the change,
This is the change.

No empty promise,
No yearbook smile,
Want my description,
No room to run,
I've read all the stories,
I know how this ends,
Now everyone face it,
Now everyone face it,
This is the change I've always wanted,
This is the change.

Tired & afraid
To look the other way,
To make the same mistake,
Convincing me that it's all a game I'm blowing,
So close to winning,
Like a young man's craze,
{Unintelligible} follow,
Still out ahead.

A silent confession,
A moment of peace,
Now blow me away,
Now I'm still happy,
This is the change,
This is the change I've always wanted,
This is the change,
This is the change.
