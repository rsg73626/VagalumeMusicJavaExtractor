LET IT GO

Growing up's the toughest thing you've ever done,
And I know you're not a victim, but you sure do act like one,
Smiling's not so hard,
That disaffected person isn't really who you are,
Just let it go.

Officials hear only the fortunate cries,
Utter your suspicions & your freedom's comprimised,
Alarmed by the sound,
They'll pick up every rock like you & throw you underground,
That's how it rolls,
Just let it go.

So when you've got your good friends,
And when you've got the good times,
Appreciate the memories
You make under the sunshine,
Don't let them go.

Don't read the papers if you're easily scared,
Every single sentence counts for twice as many prayers,
Consider this a test,
Because everything you're hoping for puts your soul on house arrest,
You're trying too hard,
Just let it go,
You're trying too hard,
Just let it go.
