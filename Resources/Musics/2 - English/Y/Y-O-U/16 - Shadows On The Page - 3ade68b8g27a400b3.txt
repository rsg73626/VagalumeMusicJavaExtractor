SHADOWS ON THE PAGE

I heard I don't pull on your heartstrings,
Well, I wish I could.
You say there's something missing,
But I don't know where to look.
And everything is shifting like the shadows on the page,
But you never really seemed to give a either way,
Seeing things in black & white,
And it hasn't figured out how to say what you mean,
I know what you mean.

I heard you need to make some money,
And I hope you will.
You say you mean to make it up to me,
But the chances of that seem pretty nil.
No need to leave notes unresolved in an unfinished symphony,
Because you never cared much for my metaphors anyway,
Hearing things as wrong or right,
And it hasn't figured out how to say what you mean,
I know what you mean.
C-c-c-c-come on!

I heard there's no chance of you staying,
Well, I wish you would.
Whatever's pulling your heartstrings
Must be pretty good.
I'm designed to try to see this from a positive point of view,
At least now I can be done with resenting you.
And if everything is left just right,
It might help me figure out how to say what I mean,
Do you know what I mean?
Come on!
