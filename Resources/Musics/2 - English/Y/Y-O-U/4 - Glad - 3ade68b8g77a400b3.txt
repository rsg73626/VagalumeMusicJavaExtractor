GLAD

I was a fire in a hole,
A solitary soul,
Looking for a list of who's who,
You were cast out for integrity,
Let down by high society,
I'm glad I found you.

You've been chased down by rumors,
Almost lost your sense of humor,
Never could tell when you were through,
I survived threats on my life
For refusing to name my price,
I'm glad I found you.

I'm glad I found you...
