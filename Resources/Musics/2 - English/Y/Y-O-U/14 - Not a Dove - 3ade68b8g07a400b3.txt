NOT A DOVE

She's not a dove,
She's found her peace,
Nothing holds her,
She can't be released,
If she ever had a regret,
She never showed it, at least not yet,
She never found a reason to return.
She doesn't make much sense,
She's always on the fence,
Balanced in between
Two tails that she can't see.
She scribbles rights & wrongs
On the sidewalk in colored chalk,
And everytime it rains,
She's washed away to start again.

She's not a dove
After a flood,
She's not a symbol
For something good,
Everything she's done
Has tried to hurt her, 'cept for being alone,
So she figures that's how she should stay.
