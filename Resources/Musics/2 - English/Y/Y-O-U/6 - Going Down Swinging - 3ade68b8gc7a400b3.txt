GOING DOWN SWINGING

If we're goin' down, then we're goin' down swingin',
If we're goin' down, then we're goin' down strong,
And if this hope is just a song that we're singin',
Won't you sing along?

We can't count on the rumors to help us,
We can borrow from the kids in the hall,
Mountains of trouble that we're climbing up tall,
And we'll be goin' down swingin', if we're goin' down at all.

When it's dark & the thunder is rumblin',
I can feel the lows in the world like a sigh,
And preschool prayers might not keep up from crumblin',
But it don't hurt to try.

Storms like these'll try to knock out a city,
But our power never came from our walls,
And if we're standing on the fall,
At least we're goin' down swingin', if we're goin' down at all.
At least we're goin' down swingin', if we're goin' down at all.

Oooohhhh...

It's a tough time to come up so empty,
It's a strange time to be starting out,
If we're goin' down, then we're goin' down heavy,
Without a doubt.

Time's run out for the cynical saviors,
And the hour has passed for the skeptics to stall,
Now it's our turn, answer the call,
And we'll be goin' down swingin', if we're goin' down at all.
We'll be goin' down swingin', if we're goin' down at all.
We'll be goin' down swingin', if we're goin' down at all.
If we're goin' down at all.
If we're goin' down at all.
