I FOUND YOU

....I didn't know what I was missing
'Til I found you,
I didn't know that I was missing anything
'Til I missed you,
I was hanging around,
Looking for solid moral ground,
I'm glad I found you.

You didn't know that you were lonely,
Then you found out,
You didn't know you could be lonely in such a crowd,
'Til you got out,
You were outward bound,
A little too tightly wound,
I'm glad I found you.

I was spinning around,
Transfixed by the sound,
I'm glad I found you.
