MEDICINE MAN

I want to be stronger & faster & thinner,
It doesn't seem like that should be too much to ask,
Everywhere I look I see a perfect image,
Medicine man, can you make this vision last?

(chorus)
Medicine man, give me your cosmic answer,
A word & a cure to make a good life better,
I don't want to forget when I'm older,
So keep me young forever.

The purpose should be clear, but I can't see it,
Medicine man, will you replace these tired eyes?
Free my mind & my conscience will follow,
Tell the blind judge it's okay for me to get high.

(chorus)

I feel so alone & I want pretty babies,
Medicine man, will you help me to create?
I lied when I said I don't care about the future,
It was the medicine, man, that made me talk that way.

Oh, medicine man...
