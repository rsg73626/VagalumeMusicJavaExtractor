GOODNIGHT GOES

Every penny found is a friend of the earth,
And every lost thought is a gem in the dirt,
How brilliant.
Security's a blanket that's bought & sold,
But every done deal is signed in gold,
And I'm broke & awake,
So I've gone as the good night goes.

Every piece of mind has a comfortable price,
And every free man makes a sacrifice,
How distant.
When innocence leaves it won't come back,
I try to fall asleep, but I fade to black,
And I'm broke & awake,
So I've gone as the good night goes,
And it feels like home.

I get to feeling homesick, but I'm too far in your debt,
What I wouldn't give to get to sleep in my own bed,
I want to be well-rested, but I'll pay to do what's right,
So good night.

Every penny found is a friend of the earth,
And every lost thought is a gem in the dirt,
But I'm broke & awake,
So I've gone as the good night goes,
And it feels like home,
And it feels like home.
