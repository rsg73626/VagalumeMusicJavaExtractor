TEN SHARP

It's alright with me as long as you are by my side,
Talk or just say nothing, I don't mind your looks never lie.
I was always on the run, finding out what I was looking for and
I was always insecure, just until I found
Words often don't come easy, 
I never loved to show you the inside of me oh no my
You were always patience, dragging out what I tried to hide

Chorus:
I was always on the run, finding out what I was looking for and
I was always insecure, just until I found
You you were always on my mind, you, you're the one 
I'm living for
You, you're my everlasting fire, you're my always shining star.
Nights always are good friends, 
a glass of wine and the lights down low.
You lying beside me, me full of love and filled with hope

Chorus
