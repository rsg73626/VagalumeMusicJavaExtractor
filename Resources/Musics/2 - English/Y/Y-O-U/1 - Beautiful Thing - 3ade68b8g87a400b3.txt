BEAUTIFUL THING

It's a beautiful thing,
But it's rough & unpredictable,
Makes me do things that aren't respectable,
My dignity's fading everyday,
And I'm a shootcase king,
Blind & pretending that I'm special,
My breakdowns bloom into marigolds,
These miracles happen everyday,

(Chorus:)
You can feel it but it doesn't mean you'll understand,
It's not supposed to make any sense,
But you've got to know, & you've got to show,
That you want to be a part of love.
It's beautiful.

It's a beautiful thing, (oh-oh, oh)
It's infinite & individual, (oh-oh, oh)
It's simple & remakable, (oh-oh, oh)
It's a nice place to visit, I wish I could stay,
And that's what makes me sing, (oh-oh, oh)
Makes real what once was inconceivable, (oh-oh, oh)
It makes my weaknesses invisible, (oh-oh, oh)
Stranger things happen everyday,

(Chorus)

It's a beautiful thing,
In a world that's indivisible, (oh-oh, oh)
We come together & it's possible, (oh-oh, oh)
Come together, make it possible. (oh-oh, oh)

(Chorus)
