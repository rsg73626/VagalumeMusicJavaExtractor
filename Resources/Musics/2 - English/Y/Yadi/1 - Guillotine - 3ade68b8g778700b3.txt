GUILLOTINE

Lay down your swords, lay down your pistols
Call off your dogs, show no resistance
You'll fall like a guillotine, and kneel before the queen
You'll fall like a guillotine, and I will rise

Raise up your walls, tighten your blindfold
(?), hide in a foxhole
You'll fall like a guillotine, and kneel before the queen
You'll fall like a guillotine, and I will rise

I don't need blue blood running through my veins because
Like a queen, like a queen, I can make you say you love me
I don't need blue blood running through my veins because
Like a queen, like a queen, I can make you love me
I can make you love me

Lay down your swords, lay down your pistols
I'll hit your heart from any distance
You fall like a guillotine, and kneel before the queen
You fall like a guillotine, and I will rise

I don't need blue blood running through my veins because
Like a queen, like a queen, I can make you say you love me
I don't need blue blood running through my veins because
Like a queen, like a queen, I can make you love me

Envy and I, darkness and light
Gods can have it all, so why can't I?
Love and desire, life after life
The gods can keep it all, if you'll be mine

And I will rise, and I will rise
And I will rise, and I will rise

I don't need blue blood running through my veins because
Like a queen, like a queen, I can make you say you love me
I don't need blue blood running through my veins because
Like a queen, like a queen, I can make you love me
