DIRTY HANDS

Now that your apologies no longer mean anything
Yu run away from the problems you created
Your serinity is tainted with hate
Your selfishness got you what you wanted at a price you can't pay

So you run, you hide, you cry, you beg for sympathy
You'll get over it in time, but I'll still be fucked
You'll wash your hands of all of this
But I'll still be dirty
