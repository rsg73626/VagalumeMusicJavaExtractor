SMILE

Friendship came so easy
I wanted so much more
To touch you, to smell you, to be the one and only
And when it happened, it happened just like the movies

Boy meets girl, boy loves girl, it's only a preview of a movie
I want to see, but you don't
Boy loves girl, girl destroys boy

Now friendship is easier said than done
If only I could laugh with you
If only I could smile
