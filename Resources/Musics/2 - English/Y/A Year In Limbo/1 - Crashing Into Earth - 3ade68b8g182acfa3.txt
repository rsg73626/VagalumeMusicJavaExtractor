CRASHING INTO EARTH

Hate today. Im waiting for tomorrow. Waiting for a phone call to change it all. Sitting still. Wanting back the times that werent so hollow. Knowing if I try to get what I want Ill only fall. help me out. im crashing it burns. falling into reality. we always think our worst thoughts at night. Hate to say that things could still go wrong. hoping that it gets better from here. drown it out with memories and wishful thinking. not sure if anyone can hear me while im sinking.
im giving up on hoping, but someone said it always gets better. the phone call isnt coming. the sudden change is taking forever.
