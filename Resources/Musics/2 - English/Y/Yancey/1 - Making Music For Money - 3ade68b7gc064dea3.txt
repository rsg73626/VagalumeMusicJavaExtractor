MAKING MUSIC FOR MONEY

I woke up this morning
I was tired as I could be
I think I was counting my money
When I should have been counting my sheep.
My agent he just called me
And he told me what I should be
That I should make my music for money
Instead of makincl my music for me.

I said I know that this may sound funny
But money don't mean nothin' to me
I'm gonna make my music for money
I'm gonna make my music for me.

He said the people buy the love song
Rock'n'roll but not too long.
He said
Girl you've got to be commercial
If you want to turn the people on
I said
turning on the people
Now that's a beautiful place to be
But if I spend my time making them up a rhyme
Who's gonna turn on me?
I know that this may sound funny . . .

I said I know that this may sound funny . . .

I know that this may sound funny . . .
