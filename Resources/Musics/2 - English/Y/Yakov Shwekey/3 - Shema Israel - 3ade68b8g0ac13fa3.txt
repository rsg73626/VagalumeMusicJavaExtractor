SHEMA ISRAEL

He raised his hand to wave goodbye
Saw the pain in mother's eyes
Who left her little precious boy of four
In a citadel of ashen stone
That preached a faith unlike his own
Perhaps he may just yet survive this war

In the shadows stood a man in black
My child he said, you must not look back
Yet one image lingered, the tears on her face
And mother's words from their last embrace

(Chorus:)
Shema, shema israel
Know that there is but one g-d above
When you feel pain, when you rejoice
Know how he longs to hear your voice
Hashem elokeinu, hashem echad

Deep within the iron gate
Far from the stench of war and hate
He knew not of a world gone insane
You must believe us, he was told
Our faith alone can save your soul
Please let us heal your wounds and ease your pain
He tried not to forget his past, his home
But he was so very young and all alone
While visions of his shtetl, so vivid and clear
Began to fade, and all but disappeared

(Chorus:)
Shema, shema israel
Know that there is but one g-d above
When you fel pain, when you rejoice
Know how he longs to hear you voice
Hashem elokeinu, hashem echad

The winds of war had finally passed
One man took on a sacred task
To bring the scattered jewish children home
He travelled far, from place to place
A quest to reignite the faith
Of those sent into hiding long ago

He entered the fortress grey and cold
Your kind is not among us, he was told
Hashem above, he whispered, please don't let me fail
As he began to sing shema israel

(Chorus:)
Shema, shema israel
Know that there is but one g-d above
When you feel pain, when you rejoice
Know how he longs to hear your voice
Hashem elokeinu, hashem echad

Shema, shema israel
Know that there is but one g-d above
When you feel pain, when you rejoice
Know how he longs to hear your voice
Hashem elokeinu, hashem echad
