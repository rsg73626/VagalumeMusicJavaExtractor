FOREVER YOU (INGLÃŠS)

Do you remember a young girl that would 
follow and linger around your shadows? 

Do you remember such child that could 
express both tears and laughter in just one gaze? 

When it was morning I would pick out the clothes that you liked 
and the very first thing I'd dream would be of you coming to me. 

Even when your heart, that loved me, changed little by little, 
I believed that it wasn't seperation. 

Please don't go.. Because I couldn't say those words that day. 

I was the only one who loved. 
The tears that I cried the day you left me, made me like this. 

Please don't go because I couldn't say those words that day. 
I was the only one who loved. The tears that I cried the day you 
left me, made me like this. 

If by chance you have forgotten the way back to me and 
you are lost somewhere, don't worry about anything. Just stay there. 
Because my small heart will find you and I'll hold you. 

So stay with my love 
Forever
