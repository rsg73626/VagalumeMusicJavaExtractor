THIS DEADMAN'S LOVE

It's not true, you're not my love. 
That's right, you doesn't suit me. 
Even when I first saw you, it wasn't you who entered my heart. 
Run away so that my eyes won't be able to see you, 
so that my heart won't reach you, so that my heart won't know. 

Filled with hate, you've evaded my heart and planted lowly roots 
I love you, and you had loved me but we can't do this. 
It has to stop and not continue. 

There's nothing that can be done. I just have to act it didn't happen 
and stop myself from crying. 
If I hadn't seen you--no if you didn't exist at all then I wouldn't hurt 
I hate you for showing me what love is and because of love, saving me. 
There's nothing that I can do 

Filled with hate, you've evaded my heart and planted lowly roots 
I love you, and you had loved me but we can't do this. 
It has to stop and not continue. 
I love you, and you had loved me but we can't do this. 
It has to stop and not continue.
