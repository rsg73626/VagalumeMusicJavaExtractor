WILL BE MINE (JANGNARA AND FRIENDS)

Oh how I hurt after I had meet you. 
Always I recieved wounds as I stayed by your side. 

Oh how I wished you would hold me. 
This night I dream a dream where you become my love. 

You and I will be the one 

I believe that one day my love will come true. 
That my true feelings will be recognized. 

Now what am I going to do? I can't even imagine a life without you. 
My everything is already yours. 

Even if you don't want it. I've already decided 
that I'm going to give you all my love 
Please accept my heart. 

You and I will be the one 
and Don't let me go away 

Don't turn away from me. There's nothing I want. 
I just want to stay by your side. 

Now what am I going to do? I can't even imagine a life without you. 
My everything is already yours. 
Even if you don't want it. I've already decided 

that I'm going to give you all my love 
Please accept my heart.
