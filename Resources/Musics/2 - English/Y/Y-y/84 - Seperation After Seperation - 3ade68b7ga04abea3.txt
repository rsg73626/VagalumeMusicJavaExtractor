SEPERATION AFTER SEPERATION

That gaze, that laugh is still the same, 
Even your habit of swallowing your words and 
clumsily spitting them out. 
So many days have gone by and we've hurt a lot 
but now that we've met by chance and are sitting here 
it feels like someone's turned back time so 
that we are like we used to be. 
We share the good memories and put away our scarred hearts 

Does she treat you well? Has she replaced me perfectly? 
I nod my head when you ask me if I have someone that I love 
but you wouldn't know that person is you. 
Perhaps I've been waiting for this moment for a long time 
to put my selfish seperation behind me and apololize to you. 
Do I look happy to you? I don't look sad, do I? 
but now that we've met by chance and are sitting here 
it feels like someone's turned back time so 
that we are like we used to be. 
We share the good memories and put away our scarred hearts 

That day I extended my hand as a sign of breaking up 
but by chance did you take my hand as an attempt to hold on to me? 
I think I might understand now and I regret it so much but 
now you're rising up from your seat. 
La La La~ 
We're shaking hands in a different way then that day before 
and you'll be going far away for forever 
La La La~
