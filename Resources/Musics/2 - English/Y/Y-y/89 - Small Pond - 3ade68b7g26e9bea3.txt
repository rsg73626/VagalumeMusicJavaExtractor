SMALL POND

In the deep forest beside the path, there's a tiny pond. 
And although there's only dirty water and nothing lives there, 
long, long ago they tell me that there used to live two pretty little 

carps here. 
One bright summer day in the small pond in the deep forest 
the two carps faught and one went above the water. 
The very tender skin of the fish rotted away 
and the water followed suit and rotted away. 
So they say that's why nothing is able to 
live inside the pond. 


In the deep forest beside the path, there's a tiny pond. 
There's only dirty water and nothing lives there. 
The once green leaves fall one and then two at a time. 
Upon the pond they become little boats and then they sink deep down. 
As a lost deer wandered in the forest it found the pond and drank from 

it and fell asleep. 
The sun sets west of the mountain and though the evening is silent, 
After a small ladybug whistles by the back of the moutain 
The black water quietly moves in endless time 
as countless seasons pass. 
And so in the deep forest beside the path, there's a tiny pond. 
There's only dirty water and nothing lives there
