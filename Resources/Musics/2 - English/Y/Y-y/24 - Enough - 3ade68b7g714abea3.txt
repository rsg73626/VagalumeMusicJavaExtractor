ENOUGH

No matter how hard I think 
It seems like I've come a long way but 
is everything they way it was? Is everything back in its place? 

Will I know tomorrow? 
I'm alone.. 
no matter how many times I try to stand up 
but because the sky is holding me back.. 

Even if I try to act as if I don't know 
words come out from my lips by themselves.. 

It was you, the empty place beside me. 
It must've been you who made me alone. 
I'll try to hate you Please try and understand why 
I, who can't seem to erase you, get weary little by little. 

How far must I go so that I can start over? 
I'll try.. back to before I knew you. 
I'll even try to let myself go completely 

Even if I laugh and say that I'm at ease, at the end of 
my day you come back to me. 
It was you, the empty place beside me.. 
It must've been you who made me alone.. 

I'll try to hate you 
please try to understand why I, who can't seem to 
erase you, get weary little by little. 

I still can't raise my head and 
I draw you coming back to me. 

Can it really not be? 
That empty place by your side.. 
Even if I die, can it not be me? 

I tried to love you even though I was alone 
but I was uneasy without you who should be here. 

I'll stop and let you go.. I'm sorry..
