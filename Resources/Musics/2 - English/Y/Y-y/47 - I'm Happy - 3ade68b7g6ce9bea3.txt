I'M HAPPY

'Forgive me' I don't want to ask you these kind of things 
But now there's nothing I can do about it. 

I prayed that you wouldn't love that person 
But it's too late now 

(You used to) laugh so brightly 
(I remember) your appearance 
(Next time) don't meet (another man like me) 
You have to be happy. 

Whatever the cost you have to meet 
a good person and love again 
Past those memories, you have to forget me 

(You used to) laugh so brightly 
(I remember) your appearance 
(Next time) don't meet (another man like me) 
You have to be happy. 

So that I have have strenght (I remember) 
your appearance (when you laughed brightly) 
And next time (don't meet) a man like me 

Oh please, you have to be happy 

I'm happy 
Because of those days when I was able to see you 
I can't forget you until the day I die 
I love you...
