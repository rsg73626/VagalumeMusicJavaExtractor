I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE MY WOMAN

Only as a dongseng, just that much you think I'm adorable 
but noona you are woman to me. 
You say "what do you know?" "you'll understand when you're older" 
you say that I'm acting rashly but noona you re a woman to me. 
No matter who you meet or whoever you meet and no matter what you do, 
I can only wait. 

Because noona is woman, because you are my woman. 

I'll call you by you, no matter what you say. 
So that you can feel me as a man, I'll hold you tightly. 
I'll call you by you. No matter what you say, I don't care. 
Don't be surprised. 
If you really look, you are a young girl. 

Where have you gone? Where do you hurt? 
You look sad. Noona, it doesn't suit you. 
When I ask you "has something happen?" 
"what happened", you just tousle my hair. 
If someone makes noona cry, 
whoever that might be I'm not going to stand it. 

Because noona is my woman, becaue you are my woman. 

I'll call you by you, no matter what you say. 
So that you can forget your sadness, I'll hold you tightly. 
I'll call you by you. No matter what you say, I don't care. 
Be in my embrace. 
If you really look, you are a young girl. 

Becaue I like you I must be doing this. 
I know that this isn't right. 
Because I like you.. Because I like you.. 
Because noona is my woman, because you are my woman. 
Because you drive me insane. 

Don't be sorry, because I'm happy. 
Even if I look at you, I shed tears. 
I'll call you by you. No matter what you say, I don't care. 
Just be my side. 

In the end I'm telling you you are my woman.
