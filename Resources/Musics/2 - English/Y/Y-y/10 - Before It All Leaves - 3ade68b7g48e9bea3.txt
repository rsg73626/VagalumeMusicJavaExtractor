BEFORE IT ALL LEAVES

Before the longing all leaves tell me that you love me 
Before the hatred breaks tell me that you love me... that you... 

Let my weakening heart rest with your touch 
That it seems like forever in your emrbrace... that it... 

You're like the wind who just grazes my clothes 
and like the waves you rush in and rush out 
You are the white foam that hits my heart 

Let my weakening heart rest with your touch 
That it seems like forever in your emrbrace... that it... 

You're like the wind who just grazes my clothes 
and like the waves you rush in and rush out 
You are the white foam that hits my heart 

Before the longing all leaves tell me that you love me 
Before the hatred breaks tell me that you love me... that you...
