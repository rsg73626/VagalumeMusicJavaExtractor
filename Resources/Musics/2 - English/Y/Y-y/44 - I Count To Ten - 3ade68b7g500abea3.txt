I COUNT TO TEN

I didn't know how much you loved me 
because when we were together you covered my eyes. 
I didn' t know then, how happy I was 
because even if you hid, my embrace as small. 
It isn't till after I've been taught seperation, I know. 

I count to ten and when I turn around 
I can't move a step because I feel, 
like a habit, that you just might call out to me, 
that you just might look for me. 

I count to ten and when I turn around 
I can't move a step because I feel, 
like a habit, that you just might call out to me, 
that you just might look for me. 

It wouldn't be too late right? 
It wouldn't be I couldn't see you hiding 
because the world is so big and spacious? 

The more I count the stars and the more the days go 
I'll wait, even if it's hard and painful. 
When the day comes that you come back, I won't let you go again. 
I'm practicing, today too, how to walk backwards.
