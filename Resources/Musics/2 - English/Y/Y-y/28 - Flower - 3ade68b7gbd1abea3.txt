FLOWER

You're looking into my eyes as if you're standing infront of me with flowers in your hand. 
I remember your expression as you pondered on whether to give them to me or not. 

I know that it's going to be hard to say and 
that there's nothing left to do because the love is gone 
and I know that you won't be able to hold me as I cry all my tears 
I just have to get used to it now 

Go far, far away from me if that'll put your heart at ease 
Go far away before the petals of the flowers I'm holding, wilt away 

I have the flowers that I've always wanted to receive from you now 

It's okay, I'm happy with just this. 
I don' t have anymore to ask of you 
because you're leaving behind these beautiful memories 
so that the days when we love can be remembered. 

Go far, far away from me if that'll put your heart at ease 
Go far away before the petals of the flowers I'm holding, wilt away 

No matter how I try and hold on to you when you don't love me, 
holding you like this makes it me feel even lonlier. 
I'm so sad.. 

Goodbye goodbye, you're going far away 
Turn around and look at me again, don't worry I won't try to stop you 
I hope that you'll be happy, I love U
