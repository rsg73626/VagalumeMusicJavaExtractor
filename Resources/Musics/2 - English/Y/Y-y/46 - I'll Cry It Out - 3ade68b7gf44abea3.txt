I'LL CRY IT OUT

Stop right there just as you are and turn you steps around. 
I cry out with sorrow from the sadness of 
losing the other half of my love. 

I can't believe your words of breaking up 
as you said you were going, the tears that I shed then, 
or your sillhouette as you went farther away. 
I'm still here the same, like this. 

They love each other so, but they live so far away, yet 
under the same sky. I cry out with a hard time 

I see your confident smile and see that you've cut your long hair 
and for the first time I cry out because I hate you. 

I can't believe your words of breaking up 
as you said you were going, the tears that I shed then, 
or your sillhouette as you went farther away. 
I'm still here the same, like this. 

They love each other so, but they live so far away, yet 
under the same sky. I cry out with a hard time 

My voice is carried by the wind to reach the sky the ver ends of the sky 
and comes back around. 
My shadow, illuminated by the starlight, grows like my longing. 

Small gestures little by little, 
Every day, day by day 
From that one kiss I can feel your 
breathing.. and it spreads all through my body 

They love each other so, but they live so far away, yet 
under the same sky. I cry out with a hard time 
I cry out again and I cry out again.
