WORDS HARD TO SAY

Though we're breaking up and I won't ever see you again 
Let me ask one last favor. 
The only thing that I can do for you who's filled with tears, 
is to let you go with ease. 

These words are a bit awkward and so hard to say to you 
who's so like me and to him who isn't me. 

I hope that you erase all the memories of love and 
memories of thankfulness and even my tears. 
Don't hurt anymore and don't turn around 
just live happily from now on. 

I knew a long time ago that a love other than me, had 
taken all for your heart. 

I don't want to say these to you who's so like me 
and to him who isn't me, no matter how hard I try. 

I hope that you erase all the memories of love and 
memories of thankfulness and even my tears. 
Don't hurt anymore and don't turn around 
just live happily from now on. 

Don't me sorry, don't regret it because he's going to 
treat you so much better than I could. 
Because this seperation would be good for me if you'd just smile 
and forget me completely inside his embrace. 

It'll be okay, I'll get used to it no matter 
how hard it is to love alone. 
Because I'll just keep you inside of my heart as you 
leave and turn around.
