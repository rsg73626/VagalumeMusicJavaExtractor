BECAUSE OF THE MEMORY

The day that I fell in love it felt as if I'd suffocate. 
That day I lost you who had become my everything. 
Why is fate so cruel? 
And though I close my eyes to try and look away, the past comes closer. 

I am able to withstand another day because of those memories 
Because the memories hurt so much 
and because you are still left in my heart, 
I shed a tear and like that I keep you here. 

The day that I confessed my love for the first time 
and the day that we had to break up too, 
Do you still have those wounds? 
All I can wish for is that they heal. 
And I beg that you hate me...please.. 

Because of those memories I am able to withstand another day. 
Because the memories hurt so much 
and because you are still left in my heart, 
I shed a tear and like that I keep you here. 

I am able to withstand another day because of those memories. 
Because the memories hurt so much 
and because you are still left in my heart, 
I shed a tear and like that put you back to your side, to you who can't have. 

Because the memories hurt so much 
and because you are still left in my heart, 
I shed a tear and like that I keep you here.
