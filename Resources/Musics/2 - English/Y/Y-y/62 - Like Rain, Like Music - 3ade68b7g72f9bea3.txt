LIKE RAIN, LIKE MUSIC

When the rain falls and the music flows I think of you. 
The night that you left, it rained like this too. 

When the rain falls and the music flows I think of you. 
The night that you left, it rained like this too. 

Today too I send away the day, soaking in the rain 
It's because our music-like love story 
makes me hurt so much like the falling rain. 

When the rain falls and the music flows I think of you. 
The night that you left, it rained like this too. 
Today too I send away the day, soaking in the rain 

It's because our music-like love story 
makes me hurt so much like the falling rain. 

and so the painful rain.. came..
