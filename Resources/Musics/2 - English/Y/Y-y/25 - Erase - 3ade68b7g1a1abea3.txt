ERASE

The day after our break up, without your voice 
I woke up alone in the morning. 

I can't believe it. I watch the phone. 
Your picture, our picture 
is still the way it was, its here but 

What am I going to do? I already miss you but 
I probably have to erase you now, to erase everything. 
Even your smiling picture, and our happy pictures. 

Everytime I erase a picture my heart starts to burn 
Your picture little by little becomes clouded. 
I even try to call out to you in the picture, and try to touch you. 
Its such a cruel thing, to erase you. 

You're just like you always are, you're laughing, 
in the picture you're laughing but.. 
We must've been happy then, I must've not known it then... 
We were so good, we would've been so good. 

Everytime I erase a picture my heart starts to burn 
Your picture little by little becomes clouded. 
I even try to call out to you in the picture, and try to touch you. 
Its such a cruel thing, to erase you. 

Now I close my eyes and erase you, 
since we're nothing now. 
Now I close my eyes and erase you, 
now there's only one picture left. 

For the last I see your face. You're so beautiful. 
And so now since I can't see you again 
I call out to you just more time, and touch you one more time. 
Its such a cruel thing but, 
I erased you.
