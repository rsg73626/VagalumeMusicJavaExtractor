GRACE (INGLÃŠS)

It's going to be okay 

Even if we lose this foolish love of mine, it'll be okay 

I prepare my heart and I put some makeup on and 
go alone to that path I had gone with you. 
There's a bounce in my step and a slight redness to my face 
It's a good day for forgetting you 

I'll be okay even if a few tears are shed 
because they're there to wash the sadness away 
I'm going to be free now 
Love, love, go far away 

I put my trust in you but you've left me alone crying 

I climb above reality and throw your name up as well 
as these remnant memories that hold me down 
I take a deep breath and spit out today 
It's a good day for forgetting you 

I'll be okay even if a few tears are shed 
because they're there to wash the sadness away 
I'm going to be free now 
Love, love, go far away 

Forgetting wasn't such a big deal but 
what am I suppose to do with this livid longing? 

I'll be okay even if a few tears are shed 
because they're there to wash the sadness away 
I'm going to be free now 
Love, love, go far away 

My love, my love go far away 
so that I can't hold onto you again
