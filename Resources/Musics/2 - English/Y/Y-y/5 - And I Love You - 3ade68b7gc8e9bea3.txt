AND I LOVE YOU

Is that really you turned around? 
I feel like I'm dreaming even when my eyes are open 
I was the one who hurt you and told you to leave, 
but I'm crying 

These conversations going around and around in my heart, 
and the love that I should've turned away from 
I've got to put them behind me just like this and let you go 
The more I love you I'm left with longing 

My love, please leave me now because 
I've hidden my tears with my long hair 
Turn away from me right here, look I'm smiling 

You have to be happy where you're going 
so that I won't even wait for you. 
Just believe my lie this time, that there's 
already another love inside of me. 

These conversations going around and around in my heart, 
and the love that I should've turned away from 
I've got to put them behind me just like this and let you go 
The more I love you I'm left with longing 

My love, please leave me now because 
I've hidden my tears with my long hair 
Turn away from me right here, look I'm smiling 

Sometimes everything becomes hazey 
and this moment will probably become a memory too 
I want to believe that... 

Though there were a lot of tears when we were together, we were happy. 
The love you've given me is enough for me. 
I was everything to you, I'm only going remember up to that point.
