WHEN LOVE PASSES

Even if that person sees me, I don't know that person. 
Even if my beating heart hurts 
I don't know you anymore. 
Even if you know me, I can't remember. 
Even if my throat begins to burn and tears fall when love passes 
When that face that I missed so much just passes by 
I no longer have any regrets of your collapsed figure. 

Even if you know me, I can't remember. 
Even if my throat begins to burn and tears fall when love passes 
When that face that I missed so much just passes by 
I no longer have any regrets of your collapsed figure. 

Even if you know me, I can't remember. 
Even if my throat begins to burn and tears fall 
when love passes..
