SHAPE OF YOUR LIPS

My eyes can't believe what they're seeing. 
Your lips are colder than ice. 
The shape of your lips as they speak words 
of breaking up, make's my breath stop. 
Please, please, please, pease, please don't ask 
me to end this. 

Are you going to throw me away? 
Is it not me? 
Are you going to even refuse me permission to love you? 
I'm hanging onto your feet and crying but could 
you not just right there as you are, now? 

I draw back at your gaze that is colder than the words "let go". 
Please, please, please, please, please don't leave me here and go. 

Are you going to throw me away? 
Is it not me? 
Are you going to even refuse me permission to love you? 
I'm hanging onto your feet and crying but could 
you not just right there as you are, now? 

Would there never be a chance for me again? 
Do you not have time to love me? 
Even though you shove me away with two hands saying that you're sick of me, I can't live a day without you. 

Please, please, please, please, please 
We're you heartless from the beginning? 

Are you going to throw me away? 
Is it not me? 
Are you going to even refuse me permission to love you? 
I'm hanging onto your feet and crying but could 
you not just right there as you are, please...?
