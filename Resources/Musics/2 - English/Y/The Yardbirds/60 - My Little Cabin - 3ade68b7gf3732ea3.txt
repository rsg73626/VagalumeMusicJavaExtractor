MY LITTLE CABIN

(Rice Miller Williamson)
In my one room little cabin,
Just me and my little girl alone,
In my one room little cabin,
Just me and my little girl alone,
It make you feel so good,
When your baby lyin' down in your arms.

The little room was so small,
I couldn't even put up no cookin' stove,
The little room was so small,
I couldn't even put up no cookin' stove,
But you can tell from the weather,
So cold, so cold outdoors.

I could hear it rainin',
See the lightnin' flashin' on my window pane,
I could hear it rainin',
I could hear it rainin',
See the lightnin' flashin' on my window pane,
Ohhh, the little girl lay her head in my chest,
And said "I love you Sonny Boy,
God knows I'm not ashamed."
