I REMEMBER THE NIGHT

(Pirollo / Finizio)
I remember the night,
I was holding you tight,
And I'll never forget how you were.

You had [brocades ?] of blue,
And an umbrella too,
And a beautiful long piece of fur.

And as I held you close,
And you'd propose a toast,
With champagne; and I'd cry out "Yes sir!"

And we took all our cares,
Up the apples and pears,
And I'll always remember the night.

Velvet and lace,
What an awful disgrace,
With the man who was sick in your [soup ?].

He was rude, wasn't he,
And I told him to flee,
But he gave me a punch in the tooth.

Then he left, but before,
All the brandy he poured,
Down your dress, and you raised the roof.

And we took all our cares,
Up the apples and pears,
How well I remember the night.

repeat first four verses
I'll always remember the night.
... to fade
