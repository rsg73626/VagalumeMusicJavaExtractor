THE SUN IS SHINING

 (James)
The sun is shining,
Don't you know it's raining in my heart.
The sun is shining, yeah,
But don't you know that it's raining in my heart.
I know I love you baby,
But the best of friends must part.

I had a dream,
I had a dream one rainy night.
I had a dream,
I had a dream one rainy night.
My baby said she wasn't going to leave me,
So everything turned out right.
