TOO MUCH MONKEY BUSINESS

Runnin' to-and-fro, hard workin' in the mill.
Never fail in the mail, yeah, come a rotten bill.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

Salesman talkin' to me, tryin' to run me up a creek.
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week, ahh.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

Blond hair, good lookin', tryin' to get me hooked.
Want me to marry, get a home, settle down, write a book.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

Every day, same thing, gettin' up, goin' to school.
No need for me complaining, my objection's overruled, ahh.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

Telephone, something wrong, dime gone, will mail,
Oughtta sue the operator, for telling me a tale, ahh.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

I been to Yokohama, been fightin' in the war.
Army bunk, army crew, army food, army corps, aah.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks.
Wipe the windows, check the tyres, check the oil, a dollar gas.
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business,
For me to be involved in!

Too much monkey business for me!
