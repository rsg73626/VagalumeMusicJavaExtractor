SCRATCH MY BACK

 (Chris Dreja / Jim McCarty / Jeff Beck / Keith Relf / Paul Samwell-Smith)
Baby, I got a problem,
I don't know what to do.
Baby, I got a problem,
Bleep me, it concerns you.
You're the only one can help,
I need you to.
I know you can do it,
You can do it if you try.
My, my, my, my,
You can do it if you try.
Don't [hold me back?], babe,
Just scratch my back, babe,

Baby, scratch my back,
Baby, scratch my back,
Baby, scratch my back,
Baby, scratch my back,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Scratch my back.

I'm feeling much better babe,
Like I know I should do,
Feeling much better, woman,
All because of you.
I knew that you could do it,
You could do it if you tried.
Come along baby,
Come along tonight,
Make me feel alright, baby,
Come along tonight.
Turn me round now,
Turn me round and come along baby now, now,

Scratch my back,
Yeah, now, scratch my back,
Scratch my back,
Scratch my back,
Don't [hold me back?],
Scratch my back.
