MY BABY

(Mort Shuman / Jerry Ragovoy)
Anderson Theatre version
And when they say that lovers feign,
Well, to me, you know, it don't matter no how,
All I gotta do is call your name,
Well then I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby.

And when I work hard each and every day,
When I come home my baby has a lot to say,
Most of what she tells me is that she's mine,
'Cos you know I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby.

You know I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby.

Deep, deep, deep in the heart of night,
Lay my head down and go to sleep,
I know everything's gonna be alright,
Because I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby,
You know I've got,
My baby.

BBC version
And when they say that lovers feign,
Well, to them, you know, that may be true,
All I gotta do is call your name,
Well then I've got,
My baby.
Yes I have,
You know I've got,
My baby.

And when I work hard each and every day,
It don't matter not to me no more,
All I gotta do is just call your name,
Well then I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby.

You know I've got,
My baby.
Yes I have,
You know I've got,
My baby.

Deep, deep, deep in the heart of night,
I lay my head down and go to sleep,
I know everything's gonna be alright,
Because I've got,
My baby.
- Yes I have.
You know I've got,
My baby,
- Yes I have.
You know I've got,
My baby.

You know it's a worry to me no how,
All I gotta do is call your name,
And then I've got,
My baby.

I lay my head down and go to sleep,
- Go to sleep,
I know everything's gonna be alright,
Because I've got,
My baby.

You know I've got,
My baby,
