PONTIAC BLUES

(Rice Miller Williamson)
I found out,
What my baby likes.
I found out,
What my baby likes.
[She likes a] whole lot of loving,
And a straight-eight Pontiac.

We gonna get on the highway,
[And cut the?] bright lights [on?]
Get on the highway,
[Got the?] bright lights [on?]
Turn the radio on,
Dig that voice from the North.

Oh,
[?]
Yes baby I know.
[?]
With your head in my chest,
[... in my bed ?]

We gonna move,
down highway 49.
We gonna move,
down the highway 49.
She got her head in my chest
[... fine?]
