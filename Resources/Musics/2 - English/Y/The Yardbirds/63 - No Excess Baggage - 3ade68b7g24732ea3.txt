NO EXCESS BAGGAGE

 (Atkins / Derrico)
I'm moving,
I'm gonna see the world while I can.
I'm moving,
I'm gonna be a well rounded man.
And there ain't no room for no-one else,
I've got to learn it all for myself.

No excess baggage,
- There to worry me.
No excess baggage,
- There to hurry me.
No excess baggage, girl,
I must roam,
All alone,
On my own,

I'm hungry,
I wanna taste the fruits of the world.
So hungry,
And assure I do love you girl.
But if you're what I'm searching for,
My heart will lead me back to your door.

No excess baggage,
- There to worry me.
No excess baggage,
- There to hurry me.
No excess baggage, girl,
I must roam,
All alone,
On my own.

But if you're what I'm searching for,
My heart will lead me back to your door.

No excess baggage,
- There to worry me.
No excess baggage,
- There to hurry me.
No excess baggage, girl,
I must roam,
All alone,
On my own.
I gotta roam,
All alone,
- No excess baggage.
On my own.
I gotta roam,
- No excess baggage.
All alone,
On my own.
- No excess baggage.
I gotta roam,
- No excess baggage.
On my own.
