FIVE LONG YEARS

(Eddie Boyd)
Well, have you ever been mistreated?
D'you know what I'm talking about?
Well, have you ever been mistreated?
D'you know what I'm talking about?
I worked five long years for one girl,
She had the nerve to put me out.

Got a job in a steel mill,
Shucking steel like a slave.
Five days and every Friday, I work and bring home my pay.
If you've ever been mistreated,
D'you know what I'm talking about?
Well, I worked five long years for one girl,
She had the nerve to put me out.

I finally learned my lesson, should a long time ago.
The next little girl that I marry,
She work and bring me some gold.
If you've ever been mistreated,
D'you know what I'm talking about?
Well, I worked five long years for one girl,
She had the nerve to put me out.

If you've ever been mistreated,

She had the nerve,
She had the nerve,
She had the nerve,
She had the nerve to put me out.
