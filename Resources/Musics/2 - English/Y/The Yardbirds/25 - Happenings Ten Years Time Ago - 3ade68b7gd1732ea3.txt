HAPPENINGS TEN YEARS TIME AGO

 (Chris Dreja / Jim McCarty / Jeff Beck / Keith Relf / Paul Samwell-Smith)
Meeting people along my way,
Seemingly alone one day,
But the reality of things,
That my dreaming always brings.

Happenings ten years time ago,
Situations we really know,
But the knowing is in the mind,
Sinking deep into the well of time.
Sinking deep into the well of time.

Walking in the room I see,
Things that mean a lot to me.
Why they do I never know,
Memories don't strike me so.
Memories don't strike me so.

It seems to me I've been here before,
The sounds I heard, and the sights I saw.
Was it real, was it in my dreams?
I need to know what it all means.

Happenings ten years time ago,
Situations we really know,
But the knowing is in the mind,
Sinking deep into the well of time.
Sinking deep into the well of time.
