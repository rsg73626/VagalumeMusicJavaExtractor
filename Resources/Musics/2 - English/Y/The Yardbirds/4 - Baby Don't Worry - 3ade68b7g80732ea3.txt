BABY DON'T WORRY

(Jimmy Reed)
Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well, you don't treat me, baby, like you used to do.

I can't help it, baby, if I'm acting strange.
I'm just hoping, baby, I'm not going insane.
Well baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now, you don't treat me, baby, like you used to do.
