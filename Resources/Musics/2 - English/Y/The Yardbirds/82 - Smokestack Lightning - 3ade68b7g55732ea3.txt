SMOKESTACK LIGHTNING

(Chester Burnett)
Five Live Yardbirds version
Yeah, smokestack lightning,
Don't you hear me callin'?
Don't you hear me callin' your name?
Don't you hear me callin' you?
Don't you hear me callin' you?

Tell me where did you go last night?
Gotta know who you been with.

Tell me where did you go last night?
Tell me where did you go?
Tell me where did you go?

Fare you well, goodbye, pretty baby,
Never see you no more, no more.
Fare you well, goodbye, pretty baby, goodbye,
Fare you well, goodbye.

Yeah, smokestack lightning,
Shining like gold,
Don't you hear me call out you?
Don't you hear me callin' you now?
Don't you hear me callin' you now?

Ah, stop your train, yeah,
Let me go for a ride with you,
Let me go for a ride, oh stop your train now,
Oh, stop your train now,

Fare you well, goodbye, pretty baby,
Tell me where did you go?
Why did you leave me, oh?
Oh, fare you well, goodbye, goodbye.
