MY BLIND LIFE

(Chris Dreja)
Feet on the sidewalk
I feel kinda sick
Hands out front
I need a white stick
Blurred in the morning
Bruised at night
Falling in the darkness
Could've been a fight

Chorus

My blind life
I cant see the road
I cant see the light

Kicking in the doorway
Climbing up the stairs
wading in the water
Knocking on the door
Bringing home the Bacon
Back to the wall
Feel like a looser
Gonna take a fall

Chorus

My blind life
I cant see the road
I cant see the light

Chorus

My blind life
I cant see the road
I cant see the light
