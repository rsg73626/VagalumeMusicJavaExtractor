PUTTY (IN YOUR HANDS)

 (J. Patton / K. Rogers)
You say hop and I'll hop,
You say stop and I'll stop,
You say come and I come,
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

With one wave of your hand,
I'm your slave to command,
But I'm glad it's OK,
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

You can stretch me until I'm ten feet tall,
Or cut me down to the size of a rubber ball.
You can use me, abuse me, but never remove me,
Without your love I ain't nothing at all.
Oh well ah.

They say I'm a fool,
'Cos you treat me so cruel,
But I'll go on this way.
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Oh ah-ah.

You can stretch me until I'm ten feet tall,
or cut me down to the size of a rubber ball.
You can use me, abuse me, but never refuse me,
Without your love I ain't nothing at all.
Oh well ah.

They say I'm a fool,
'Cos you treat me so cruel,
But I'll go on this way,
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.
