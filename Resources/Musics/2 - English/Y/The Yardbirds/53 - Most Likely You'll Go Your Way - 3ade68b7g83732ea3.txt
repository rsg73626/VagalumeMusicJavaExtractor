MOST LIKELY YOU'LL GO YOUR WAY

(Bob Dylan)
You say you love me,
And you're thinkin' of me,
But you know you could be wrong.
You say you told me,
That you wanna hold me,
But you know you're not that strong.
I just can't do what I done before,
I just can't beg you any more.
I'm gonna let you pass,
And I'll go last.
And time will tell just who has fell,
And who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.

You say you disturb me,
And you don't deserve me,
But you know sometimes you lie.
You say you're shakin',
And you're always achin',
But you know how hard you try.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care,
You can't be this way everywhere.
I'm gonna let you pass,
And I'll go last.
And time will tell just who has fell,
And who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.

The judge, he bears a grudge,
He's gonna ha-rm you.
But he's badly built,
And he walks on stilts,
Watch out he don't fall on you.
