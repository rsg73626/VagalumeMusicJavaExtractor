LOVE ME LIKE I LOVE YOU

(Chris Dreja / Jim McCarty / Paul Samwell-Smith / Keith Relf)
If you love me,
Like I love you,
We can keep on,
Forever true.

If you love me,
Like I love you,
We can do things,
That lovers do.

If you love me,
Like I love you,
All of our dreams,
Will come true.

Love me like I love you.
Love me like I love you.

repeat all three verses

Love me like I love you.
Love me like I love you.
Love me like I love you.
Love me like I love you.
