MR. SABOTEUR

(James McCarty)
He's Just 'round the corner
Nobody will warn ya'
You wont see his coming
The way your life's a running
As he tries to wreck you
He's bound to affect you
Stops your inspiration
And all your creation

Chorus

Hey hey hey hey
Mr. Saboteur
You wont see him waiting
As he quietly starts to stir
hey hey hey hey
Mr. Saboteur
He's there

He's easy to hide
He's deep down inside
You wont see him scheming
Wile your quietly dreaming
He may try to take you
Or very slowly break you
He'll make It all so black
you won't get it back

Chorus

Hey hey hey hey
Mr. Saboteur
You wont see him waiting there
Right behind the door
hey hey hey hey
Mr. Saboteur
He's there
