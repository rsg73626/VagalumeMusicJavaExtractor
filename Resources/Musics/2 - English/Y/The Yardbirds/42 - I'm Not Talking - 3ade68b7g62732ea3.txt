I'M NOT TALKING

EP version
I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Used to think I knew it,
Man I sure outgrew it.
Things like idle chatter,
Ain't the things that matter,
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Things I say at midnight,
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight.
I reached the final conclusion,
And all this persecution,
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Things I say at midnight,
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight.
I reached the final conclusion,
And all this persecution,
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
If I said things were awful,
It might just be unlawful.
If I said things were splendid,
You might just be offended.
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
If I said things were splendid,
Our mom might be offended.
If I said things were awful,
It may just be unlawful.
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Used to think I knew it,
Man I sure outgrew it.
Things like idle chatter,
Ain't the things that matter,
Don't call me baby, I'll call you.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
If I said things at midnight,
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight.
I reached the final conclusion,
And all this persecution,
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you.
