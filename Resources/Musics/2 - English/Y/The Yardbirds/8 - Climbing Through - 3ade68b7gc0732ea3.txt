CLIMBING THROUGH

The day's gonna come,
Just wait and see,
When we'll be together,
Just you and me.
The world outside,
Won't tell no lies,
Won't have no say,
Won't criticise.
'Cause we ain't gonna listen,
And we aint gonna care,
Because our love,
Is too deep to share,
And you are,

Climbing through
Yeah that's you,
Always know,
Just what to do,
And love me,
As much as I love you.

I'm gonna be happy,
I'm gonna be good,
Just doing the things,
I know I should.
I'm gonna get married,
And have a boy child,
He's gonna be strong,
He ain't gonna get wild.
Gonna teach him how,
To live a good life.
Some day he'll find,
A very beautiful wife,
And she'll be,

Climbing Through,
Just like you,
Always know,
Just what to do,
And love him,
As much as I love you.

And if in a family,
We're blessed with a girl,
She's gonna be the prettiest,
Little girl in the world.
She ain't gonna cheat,
She ain't gonna flirt.
She's gonna have brains,
She ain't gonna get hurt.
And think and study,
And pass exams,
And when the right boy comes,
She's gonna give him her hand.
And she'll be,

Climbing through,
Just like you,
Always know,
Just what to do,
And love him,
As much as I love you.
