TALKIN' ABOUT YOU

(Chuck Berry)
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,
I found her walking down an uptown street.
She's so fine, you know I wish she was mine,
I get shook up every time we meet.

I'm talkin' bout you,
Nobody but you.
Yes, I do mean you,
Come on and let me get a message to you.

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,
I tell ya now she looks so good.
Got so nice skin and such a beautiful lip,
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood.

I'm talkin' 'bout you,
Nobody but you.
Yes, I do mean you,
Come on and let me get a message to you.

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,
She's sitting here by my side.
Lovely indeed, that's why I asked her if she'd,
Promise me someday she would be my bride.

I'm talkin' 'bout you,
Nobody but you.
Yes, I do mean you,
Come on and let me get a message to you.
