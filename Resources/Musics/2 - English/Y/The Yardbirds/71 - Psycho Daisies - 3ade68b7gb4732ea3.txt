PSYCHO DAISIES

(Yardbirds)
Pennsylvania snow is pretty thick,
Michigan ain't where I get my kicks.

Texas is fine but it gets too hot,
And New York City's not a place to stop.

New Orleans is the home of the blues,
But California's my home with Mary Hughes.

Down in Mississippi I'm told is nice,
And all the meals there, they come with rice.

Oregon and Iowa are not for me,
The Colorado mountains are something you must see.

But back in California there's nothing to lose,
'Cos everything's swinging there with Mary Hughes.
