DRINKING MUDDY WATER

(Chris Dreja / Keith Relf / Jim McCarty / Jimmy Page)
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Well I've been running and a-hiding,
Trying to lose my mind.
Well I've been running and a-hiding,
Trying to lose my mind.
Ever since you told me,
That you weren't my kind.

Ah, ah, ah...
Drinking muddy water,
I don't know how long for.
I been drinking muddy water,
I don't know how long for.
Since I been running, babe,
I been treating you like a dog.
