DUST MY BLUES

 (James)
When I get up in the morning,
I believe I dust my blues.
When I get up in the morning,
I believe I dust my blues.
My baby said she's leaving,
So I ain't got no time to lose.

Gonna write a letter,
Gonna send a telegram.
Gonna write a letter,
Gonna send her a telegram.
Gonna write and tell my baby,
Just how fool I am.

When I get up in the morning,
I believe I dust my blues.
When I get up in the morning,
I believe I see I dust my blues.
My baby said she's leaving,
I ain't got no time to lose.
