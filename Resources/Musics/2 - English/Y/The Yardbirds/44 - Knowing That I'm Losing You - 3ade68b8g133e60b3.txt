KNOWING THAT I'M LOSING YOU

How will you spend your time, my love?
crying through the clouds above, my love
the tears will fall as rain

we're falling from a tree
the time it takes to see
the rising of the sun
the time it takes to run

measuring a summer's day
you'll only find it slips away to grey
the hours will bring you pain

the hours will bring you pain

we're falling from a tree
the time it takes to see
the rising of the sun
the time it takes to run
