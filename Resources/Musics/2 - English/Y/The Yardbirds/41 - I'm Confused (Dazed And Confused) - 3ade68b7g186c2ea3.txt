I'M CONFUSED (DAZED AND CONFUSED)

(Jake Holmes, arr. Yardbirds)
Anderson Theatre version
I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
I'm being abused,
And I think I should know,
Come on baby,
I'm starting to crack,
If you're out to get me,
You're on the right track.
Hey!
Hey, hey!

I'm dazed and confused,
Hanging on by a thread,
Come on baby,
Do you want me dead?
I can arrange that for a dollar or two.
I can't remember,
Anything about you.
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

Hey!

I'm dazed and confused,
Hanging on by a thread,
I'm being abused,
I'd be better off dead,
If you're out to get me,
You're on the right track,
Quittin' teasin',
I'm starting to crack.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey!

Cumular Limit version
I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
Give me a clue,
'Cos I just want to know.
Give me a clue as to where I am at,
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat.
Yeah I'm,
Yeah I'm,
Yeah I'm,
Yeah I'm,

I'm dazed and confused,
Hangin' on by a thread,
I've been abused,
I'd be better off dead,
Can't stand the heat,
And I'm starting to crack,
If you're out to get me,
You're on the right track.
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
I still love you,
But I still want to know,
Secrets are fun to a certain degree,
This one's no fun 'cause the secret's on me.
Yeah, yeah,
Hey, hey!

Hey!

I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
I've been abused,
And I sure wanna know,
Give me a clue as to where I am at,
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat.
Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
