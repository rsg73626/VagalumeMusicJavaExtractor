LOUISE

Oh, Louise,
Yes, you're the sweetest girl that I know.
Don't you know now, Louise,
You are the sweetest girl that I know.
You made me walk from Chicago,
Oh, to the Gulf of Mexico.

Now you know Louise,
She's like a rolling stone.
Every time she leave a man,
He had to [?]
Oh, Louise,
Why don't you hurry home,
You know I never had no good loving,
Oh, Louise, since you been gone.

Got a girl called [?]
Treat me nice and kind,
Don't [?] what you're doing,
'Cos Louise is on my mind.
Oh, Louise,
Why don't you, why don't you hurry home,
You know I ain't never had no good loving,
Oh, Louise, since you been gone.

Now Louise ain't so good looking,
And her hair ain't red,
But she cooks my breakfast and brings it to my bed.
Oh Louise, now,
Why don't you hurry home,
I ain't never had no good loving,
Oh Louise, since you been gone.
Oh yeah.

Oh Louise,
Why don't you hurry home,
Oh Louise,
Why don't you hurry home.
You made me walk from Chicago,
Oh, to the Gulf of Mexico.
