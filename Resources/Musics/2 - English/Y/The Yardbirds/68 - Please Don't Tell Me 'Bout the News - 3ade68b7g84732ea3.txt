PLEASE DON'T TELL ME 'BOUT THE NEWS

 (James McCarty)
You can read it in the morning
You can read read it late at night
Well there's been another warning
Or there's been another fight
There's a scandal going on
Some reporter stumbled on
About a leek in the press
And the world is in a mess
Wont you spare me from this story
'Cause I only get confused
Please donâ€™t tell me about the news
Please donâ€™t tell me about the news

Well some body told me lately
You've been seen down the town
Showing off your latest number
With some young guy hanging 'round
You were flirting with a kid
In a way you never did
When we used to be around
And we thought we had it found
Wont you spare me from this story
Babe I'll only get confused
Please donâ€™t tell me about the news
Please donâ€™t tell me about the news

There's a man in an office
And you know he's on the make
Long ago he sold his conscience
For the company's sake
Now he's really sealed his fate
By building an estate
An old sacred site
So we cant give up this fight
Wont you spare me from this story
And all those I would accuse
Please donâ€™t tell me about the news
Please donâ€™t tell me about the news
