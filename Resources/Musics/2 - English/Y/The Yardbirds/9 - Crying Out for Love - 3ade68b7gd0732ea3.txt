CRYING OUT FOR LOVE

(James McCarty)
You made it very clear
How you feel about
The way you put me down
When ever I'm around
What your thinking of
Your crying out for love
crying out for love

Your bitter words today
Are another way
Of hiding how you feel
Hiding what is real
What your thinking of
Your crying out for love
crying out for love

The love you need so much
You push away
All the gold you touch
Might as well be Clay
What your thinking of
Your crying out for love
crying out for love
