WITHOUT YOU

(H. Young)
I don't wanna be without you,
And I hope you feel the same too,
'Cos, baby, if you care,
Enough for me we'll share,
A lifetime,
Oh baby, be mine.

I don't wanna be without you,
But, there's not a thing I can do,
Believe that I'm the one,
There's so much we haven't done,
And I'll start,
By giving my heart.

You hold your head so high,
I know that you'll stand by me,
Always, always,
So baby, don't ask why,
Just say that I'm your guy,
Always, always.

I don't wanna be without you,
I don't wanna have to go through,
A lifetime of despair,
I'll have if you don't share,
Your world,
By being my girl.

I don't wanna be without you,
I don't wanna be without you,
I don't...
