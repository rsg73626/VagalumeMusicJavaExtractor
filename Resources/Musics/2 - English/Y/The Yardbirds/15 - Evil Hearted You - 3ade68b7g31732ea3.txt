EVIL HEARTED YOU

 (Graham Gouldman)
Evil hearted you.
You always try to put me down,
With the things you do,
And words,
You spread around against me.

Evil hearted you.
You kept,
Kidding me along,
With your phoney smile,
And with,
Your siren song smiling, beguiling,
You lead me on 'til all hope's gone,
Persuading, degrading,
On my knees I try to please.

But I love you,
Just the same,
And I want you,
To remain,
By my side,
And you'll see,
Just how much you,
Mean to me.

Evil hearted you.
You always try to put me down,
With the things you do,
And words,
You spread around against me,
About me.
What would you,
Do without me?
Smiling, beguiling,
You lead me on 'til all hope has gone.
