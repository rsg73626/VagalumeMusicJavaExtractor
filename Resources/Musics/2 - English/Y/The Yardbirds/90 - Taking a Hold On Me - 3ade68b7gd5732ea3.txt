TAKING A HOLD ON ME

Watching TV just the other day
Saw an advertisement, what can I say?
It showed a small baby, and some men in a war
I thought to myself, "What's this fighting all for? "

And I felt sad
Felt bad
I'm not pleased
There's no need
Taking a hold on me
Knew it just had to be
Never knew how it was
Knew it was just because

I spoke to some fellows here, early last night
One of those guys, he prepared for a fight
He couldn't agree to the things that I said
Am I speaking so free? He thought I should have been dead

And I felt sad
Felt bad
I'm not pleased
There's no need
Taking a hold on me
Knew it was just to be
Never knew how it was
Knew it was just because

In my hotel room, a bible I saw
[?] and what's more
[?] no more [?]
So why not be like him, don't read all those [?]

I feel sad
Feels bad
Not pleased
There's no need
Taking a hold on me
Knew it just had to be
Never knew how it was
Knew it was just because

Taking a hold on me
Taking a hold on me
Taking a hold on me
Taking a hold on me
Taking a hold on me
Taking a hold on me
