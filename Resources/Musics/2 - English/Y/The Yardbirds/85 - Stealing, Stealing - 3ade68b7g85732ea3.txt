STEALING, STEALING

 (Chris Dreja / Keith Relf / Jim McCarty / Jimmy Page)
Stealin', stealin',
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Well, put your arms around me,
Like a circle round the sun,
Now [they's got the blue,?]
We can have a little fun,
How glad it's you,
And not your sister with me now,
Saw her yesterday,
And she look's just like a ...,

Stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

I'm stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Well, sit beside me baby,
[?]
The sun is shining out now,
Just for you and I,
Look, I mean to walk you home,
Your mama's getting bad,
So I'd rather stay at home.

Stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

I'm stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
...to fade
