SHAPES IN MY MIND

 (Simon Napier Bell)
Shapes in my mind,
My eyes are closed.
The colours cry,
My brain explodes.
My body shrinks into my head,
I must have help or I'll be dead.

Please!

You've got to make be break this spell.
You've got to give me all your help.
You've got to stop my spinning brain.
You've got to be with me again.

I see your face,
I see your smile,
I see the eyes that used to cry.
I see the lips I used to kiss,
I can't forget.
I see you standing all alone,
I see the things that I did wrong.
I see I didn't try enough,
To give you love.

The love you gave,
And left behind,
Has dropped and burned inside my mind.
I can't see out,
I can't see in,
I know I'm lost, I can't explain,
The pain I felt is here again.
I've nothing left,
Is this the end?

I see your face,
I see your smile,
I see the eyes that used to cry.
I see the lips I used to kiss,
I can't forget.
I see you standing all alone,
I see the things that I did wrong.
I see I didn't try enough,
To give you love.
