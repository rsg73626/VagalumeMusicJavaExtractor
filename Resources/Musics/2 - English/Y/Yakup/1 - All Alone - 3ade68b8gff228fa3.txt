ALL ALONE

Between the shades of black and gray
That's where the hopes fade away.
Time has no mercy but faith.
For those weathered souls await.

Oh No Don't!
This life is not meant to be all alone
Yes I know
You know this life is too short to be all alone.

When my thoughts turn into a bridge.
Letting love words travel across.
Patching the coast of my heart next to yours.
With the joy of finding an eternal home.

Oh No Don't 
This life is not meant to be all alone
Yes I know 
You know that life is to short to be all alone.

You will never be!
Oh! No not with me!
This life is not meant to be...
I know you will never be
