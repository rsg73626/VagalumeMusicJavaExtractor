INSOMNIA

Oh It's dark again
The night has come
One more time

It's that clock again
The ticks that bounce 
Off the walls

My eyes pretend
As they chase my thoughts
Like they know it all

The stars remain
A silent spy
With a blinking smile

Of all the pills I have taken
Your love is the only cure for my isomnia


I want to dream again
with your heart
by my side

I Watched the dots away
lining out
those hazel eyes

Wake me up again
with your morning breath
in my mouth
