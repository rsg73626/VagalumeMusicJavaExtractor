CHEATIN' THE DEVIL

Everyone wants to schedule you
Nobody wants to follow through
Everyone wants to get their thrill
No one wants to pay their bills

Everybody looks the same
Nobody's finding fame
Everybody wants to tell their lies
Nobody wants to compromise

Everybody thinks they know it all
Nobody wants to climb the wall
Everybody wants diamond rings
Nobody gets the real thing

Everybody wants something for free
Nobody trusts destiny
Everybody wants to get their fill
Nobody wants to pay their bills
