WHO I AM

The stars are out
The moon is bright
I hope to score some wine tonight
The bottle's full so red and ripe
Now should I start a switchblade fight

Distrust myself in public
For I've become a mess
I should have stayed home last night
The werewolf's out again

I can't help who I am
What I am

Resignation's in control
I'm done my bottle
No I'm on patrol
I never do just what I'm told
And without bail I'm put on hold
