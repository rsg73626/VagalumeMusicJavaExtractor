FIRE

There's somebody watchin'
Watchin' over you
Can't you hear them whisperin'
Whisperin' words untrue
There's a party down under
Underneath the moon
And you better say your prayers
'Cause we'll be there soon
Let's go, let's go down in the fire tonight

Everybody's burnin'
Burnin' up in flames
You're next in line to play
To play those deadly games
Can you feel the beat poundin'
Poundin' on the floor
The beat will make you scream
Scream nevermore
