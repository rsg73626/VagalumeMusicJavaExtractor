MISCHIEF NIGHT

Tonight!!!

I heard a rumor it was goin' down
I heard a rumor that it's goin' down now
And I want it

But I...

I saw you in the firelight
It happened just the other night
And I want it

Ohh midnight
Ohh mischief tonight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams tonight

Ohh midnight
Ohh mischief tonight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams tonight

But I...

I'm comin' thru your town tonight
And everything will be alright
'Cause and I want it

But I...

I'm not a girl you meet before
And I'll leave you wantin' more
'Cause I got in

Ohh midnight
Ohh mischief tonight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams tonight

Ohh midnight
Ohh mischief tonight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams tonight

But I...

I heard a rumor it was goin' down
I heard a rumor that it's goin' down now
And I want it

Ohh midnight
Ohh mischief tonight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams tonight

Ohh midnight
Ohh mischief tonight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams tonight
