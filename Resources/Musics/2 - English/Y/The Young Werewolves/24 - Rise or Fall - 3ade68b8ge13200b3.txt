RISE OR FALL

There's a war going on outside
Be careful when you choose your side
Cause nobody's ever gonna hear your cries

Hangin' on to the human race
Losin' souls in outer space
Searchin' for the sacred place

So say, So say we all
Are we gonna rise or fall

Haunted by memories
Lookin' for securities
Fightin off all your enemies

When your back's against the wall
You gotta stand, stand up tall
You're in the battle time to rise or fall
