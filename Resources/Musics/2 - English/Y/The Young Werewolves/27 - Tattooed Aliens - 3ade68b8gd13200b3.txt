TATTOOED ALIENS

Lightning flashes across the sky
I got a strange feelin' and I don't know why
They're comin' to this world for you and me
The tattooed aliens from Planet 13

Help save the race
They're sent here from outer space
They're the tattooed aliens from outer space
They're all inked up and ready to go
Lucky 13 in a space sideshow
If we're gonna save the world we better do it know
Before they make the master race with the cows
