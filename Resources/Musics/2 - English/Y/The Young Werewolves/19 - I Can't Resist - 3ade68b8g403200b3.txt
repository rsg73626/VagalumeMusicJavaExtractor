I CAN'T RESIST

The moon is full and I'm ready to go
Midnight and I can't say no
The smell of flesh is on my mind
I can't resist it's just a matter of time
I've been feelin' this way for thirty days
I can's stop my evil ways

I can't resist
'Cause the pain is burnin' inside
I can't resist
I think I'm losin' my mind
I can't resist the temptation
A werewolf transformation

I saw her standin' in the dim moonlight
This seems too easy will she put up a fight
I'm now a hunter and I'm outta control
Who am I to take this beautiful soul
