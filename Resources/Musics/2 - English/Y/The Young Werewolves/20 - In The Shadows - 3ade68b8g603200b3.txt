IN THE SHADOWS

Step outside, all alone
Can't you feel it deep in your bones,
Somethin' burnin', somethin' calling your name

You see the streets are empty tonight,
You feel the pull of the warm moonlight,
Somethin' different, something changing inside

And you don't know if your feelings are wrong or right,
And you don't know where you'll end up tonight

Are you a monster, like me?

Close your eyes, deep in your dreams
Your head is filled with hollow screams
Somethin' different, something changing inside

In the shadows, you see a face
Now you know you've fallen from grace
Somethin' burnin', somethin' calling your name
