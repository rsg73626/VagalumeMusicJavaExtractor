EVIL SOUL

Tonight's the night, let's drive downtown
The kids are out can't you hear the sound
They wanna rock all night and day
But the price is steep, can they afford to pay
The devil's game is a danger zone
You better not play it alone

I wanna rock and roll
I got an evil soul

Tonight's the night but the end is near
The kids are out and they're full of fear
The clock is tickin' and the stage is set
So let's deal the cards and hope they take the bet
