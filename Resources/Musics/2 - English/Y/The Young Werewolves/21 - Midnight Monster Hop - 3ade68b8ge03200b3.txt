MIDNIGHT MONSTER HOP

Practice your screams, you'll shiver and shake
Step right up through the boneyard gate,
Six feet down, you'll love the sound
At the Midnight Monster Hop

The wolves are getting down tonight
Come howl along it's outta sight
Six feet down, you'll love the sound
At the Midnight Monster Hop

In that spooky place
Up around the bend
It won't be long until,
We're howlin on around again

Practice your screams, you'll shiver & shake
Step right up through the boneyard gate,
Six feet down, you'll love the sound
At the Midnight Monster Hop

Now boys & ghouls break out your shrouds,
Tighten your nerves and join the crowds,
Six feet down, you'll love the sound
At the Midnight Monster Hop

Practice your screams, you'll shiver and shake
Step right up through the boneyard gate,
Six feet down, you'll love the sound
At the Midnight Monster Hop
