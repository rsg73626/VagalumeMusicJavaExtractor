DEAD END FRIEND

Another pretty face
Smashin' to the ground
Destruction's always fun
When you won't be found
I just wanna see the truth
The look on your face
The sight of your hate

I don't know how to explain
Just how much I love your pain
Now that you're already gone
To become one with the fun
Dream no more my dead end friend
Should have know that this would end

I'm sick to death
Of hearin' things
About what tomorrows' bring
Stallin' here
Just wastin' time
Don't you know
Life ain't no crime

Gimme what I want
Gimme what I need
Watch you lose your soul
I leave you to bleed
