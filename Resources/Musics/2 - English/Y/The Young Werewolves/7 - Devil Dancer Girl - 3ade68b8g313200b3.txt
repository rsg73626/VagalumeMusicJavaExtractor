DEVIL DANCER GIRL

I'm gettin' real gone
While the gettin' is good
I did everything that I think I could
It's my shot hear 'round the world
A gin and a scotch
Devil dancer girl
I want some
Watch out here I come

Devil girl, devil dancin' girl

Everything here, you already heard
The same old sound shaken and stirred
It's my shot felt 'round the world
A gin and a scotch devil dancer girl
I want some
Watch out here I come
