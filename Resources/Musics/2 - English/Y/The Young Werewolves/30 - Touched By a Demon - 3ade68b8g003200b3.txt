TOUCHED BY A DEMON

Well I was willin'
Willin' to take a stand
I told my angel
Oh baby please understand
I feel the world pressin' down on me
I can't escape my demon destiny

I was touched by a demon, damned by the devil
On a highway to hell, singin' singin' rebel rebel
Touched by a demon and I was touched by a demon

I made a killin'
Killin' all my fears
I told my baby
It's time to get out of here
I feel the world pressin' down on me
I can't escape my demon destiny
