GALA MONSTER RALLY

In the gala monster rally
Frankenstein is comin' for you
Well maybe the wolfman too?
Things aren't what they seem
You better get ready to scream

'Cause in the dead of night
All monsters unite
Gala monster rally

In the gala monster rally
You better sharpen your claws
You'll hear the raven's calls
There's witches brewin' their best
We hope you'll pass the test
