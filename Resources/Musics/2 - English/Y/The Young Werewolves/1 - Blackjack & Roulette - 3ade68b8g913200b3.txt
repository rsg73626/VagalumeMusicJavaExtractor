BLACKJACK & ROULETTE

You break out the booze
I'll roll the dice, lay out the plan
That's the kind of wolfman I really am

Howl at the moon, howl at the moon tonight

You'll be dead before the morning light
That's the social call of the wolfman's bite

Blackjack & hate with a gamblers kiss
Roulette & love it's either hit or miss

Now in this game the stakes are so very high
Your money or your life there is no second try
