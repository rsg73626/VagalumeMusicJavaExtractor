DEAD AND GONE

She said to get in line
Before you're outta time
And if you wanna be mine
Beyond a reason or a rhyme

A gentle motion reels you in
And you'll never be the same again
A rattlesnake sound is what you hear
In a red light flash you disappear

Your mind is dead and gone
Like a lover wronged
Your heart is dead and gone
Your soul is dead and gone

There was a warning sign
But I paid it no mind
Because she had to be mine
I'd walk a field full of landmines
