CURSE OF THE COCAINE MUMMIES

10,000 years ago
In the deepest darkest place
The mummies awoke
To kill the whole human race
With powers of destruction
Inflicting endless pain
The only way to stop them
Is with the cocaine

'Cause it's the curse
Yeah the curse
'Cause it's the curse
Of the Cocaine mummies

The war has now begun
And there ain't no turnin' back
You better say your prayers
If the mummies attack
They're an army of the dead
Stalkin' victims in the night
Your only chance is cocaine
Or a vicious werewolf bit
