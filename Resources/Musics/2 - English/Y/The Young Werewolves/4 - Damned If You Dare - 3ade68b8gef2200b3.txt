DAMNED IF YOU DARE

Listen, 'cause you know it's true
Somethin' good's gonna come on through
All caught up in a love gone blue

Softly as the sun goes down
An orange glow fades across the town
City kids swingin' 'round and 'round

Rockin' out like they just don't care
Dirty girl treats me unfair
Drinkin' whiskey and on a tear
Damned if you do and damned if you dare

Softly as the sun goes down
And moonlight shines across the town
City kids blowin' up underground

Slowly as the moon goes down
And sunshine lights across the town
Everything is lookin' alright now
