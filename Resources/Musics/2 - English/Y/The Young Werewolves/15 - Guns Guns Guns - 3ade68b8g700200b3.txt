GUNS GUNS GUNS

Everybody's out Friday night
Lookin' for blood, lookin' for a fight
They got their guns, loaded too
And silver bullets are comin' for you
They got guns, guns
Thunderin' noises are in the air
And shatterin' glass is everywhere
Your heart is racin' what do you do
Silver bullets are comin' for you
