HOT ROD BURNIN'

I got a hot rod burnin' in my heart tonight
Out of my soul comes that Cadillac of night
Cruisin' down the highway, hell on wheels
Tires leavin' tracks all over the field
I got a hot rod burnin' in my heart tonight

Oh yeah, it'll be alright
Oh, yeah, we're racin' tonight

And I'm rockin' the line while I'm waitin' to go,
The rest of the pack is movin' way too slow
Hittin' the throttle, makin' the time,
Gotta meet the boys at quarter to 9
Well there's a hot rod burnin' in my heart tonight

There's a 500 runnin in my 72 yeah,
Black Moon risin over Big Lulu
Comin up fast, I'm takin the turn
Wheels on fire, ready to burn
There's a hot rod burnin' in my heart tonight
