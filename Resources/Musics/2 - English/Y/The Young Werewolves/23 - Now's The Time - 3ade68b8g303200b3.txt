NOW'S THE TIME

I don't know but I gotta go
I gotta get down to Mexico
Can't you hear, the voices near
Bodies are shakin' with endless fear
Stay inside, contain your pride
Gather your things and try to hide
It's judgement day the media will say
You sold your soul are you ready to pay

Now's the time, Now Now Now's the time
You better fall in line
'Cause the man aint far behind

If you feel it can't be real
You shouldn't have broken the ancient seal
Can't you see it's time to flee
Run to the hills if you wanna be free
What's that sound from underground
There's something wicked about this town
It's judgement day the media will say
You sold your soul are you ready to pay
