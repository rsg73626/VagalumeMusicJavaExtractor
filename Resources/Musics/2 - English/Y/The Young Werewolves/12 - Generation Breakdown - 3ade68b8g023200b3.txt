GENERATION BREAKDOWN

The doors are locked, but they're breakin on through
The sins of the past are comin' for you
Feels like we're all livin' on reruns
It won't be long before we can't get along

Hiding in the shadows dressed in rags
Don't forget your goody bags
What used to be fun has now taken a turn
The whole damn thing has started to burn

Generation breakdown...
I'm in a generation breakdown

Coulda, shoulda, woulda is the battle cry
Too many copies and time gone by
Can't do this and you can't say that
It's lookin kinda thin from where I'm at

Generation breakdown...
I'm in a generation breakdown

Breakin on down and we're goin fast
At this pace, it just can't last
Between what is and what should never be
There's generation breakdown vanity
