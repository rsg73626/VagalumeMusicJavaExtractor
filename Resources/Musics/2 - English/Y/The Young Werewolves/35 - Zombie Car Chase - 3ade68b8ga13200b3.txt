ZOMBIE CAR CHASE

I'm drivin' down the road
In my supped up Cadillac
And there ain't another car in sight
I passed the graveyard and headlights flashed
It looks like I'm racin' tonight
But the zombie's got a '57 Chevy
And he's already caught up to me
I'm tryin' to shake him off my trail
But his car's the fastest I've seen

It's a zombie car chase
A death drag race

When the zombie pulled up
Right next to me
I could smell the evil burnin' inside
I slammed on the gas
And I never looked back this gonna be one helluva ride
'Cause the zombie's got a '57 Chevy
And he's never lost a race just yet
I'm racin' for my life tonight
I hope I live to forget it
