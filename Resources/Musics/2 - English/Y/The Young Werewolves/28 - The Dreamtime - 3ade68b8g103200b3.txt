THE DREAMTIME

By the light of the moon, they dance and they swoon in the Dreamtime
In the night with the stars, you reach for Mars in the Dreamtime

We'll there's no time to wait,
You better listen, don't ya hesitate,
You gotta get this thing straight,
You've said the words and they've been heard,
You've opened the gate!

The shadows they weave, they swirl and they breathe in the Dreamtime,
The Mythos is true, they're coming for you in the Dreamtime,

Feel the panic in the night,
You see them smilin' with delight,
You know that something just ain't right,
You're not the one, the end has come,
Your soul is their price!

The shadows they weave, they swirl and they breathe in the Dreamtime,
In the night with the stars, you reach for Mars in the Dreamtime

Feel the panic in the night,
You see them smilin' with delight,
You know that something just ain't right,
You're not the one, the end has come,
Your soul is their price!
