THE NIGHT THE PHANTOM WENT TO GRACELAND

He's headin' down south just to see the king
He's wearin' his mask and he's ready to sing
He's pickin' up chicks sayin' "ride with me,
C'mon pretty mama go to Tennessee."
The night the phantom went down to graceland
He did a buck fifty just to make it there
He's pissin' off the cops man, but he don't care
He's drinkin' flat beer and cheap whiskey
He ain't gonna stop 'til he's in Tennessee
