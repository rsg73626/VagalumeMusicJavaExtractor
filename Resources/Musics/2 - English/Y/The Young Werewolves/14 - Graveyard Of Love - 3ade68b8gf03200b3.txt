GRAVEYARD OF LOVE

White faced ghoul
Full moon bright
The dead dance here
With me tonight
Rising now, dead no more
I scratched your name on the coffin door

Stuck inside of my head
Oh nothin' here seems right
In the graveyard of love
I'm a corpse tonight
I try to rise up
And live again
A zombie in this haze
Howlin' 'til the end

Do the hot tears flow
On a warm summer's night
Does that permanent smile
On your wrist feel right
With a black cat's howl
And your own screams
Oh why is nothin'
Ever what it seems
