DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE

Respected and admired but not what I seem
Rising up at night like a deadly dream
How was I to know
Now how will I explain
With Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde up in my vein.
Insane, insane
How was I to know now how will I explain
Insane, insane
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame, what a shame

I'm prowlin' down the street and what do I spy
A long legged lady givin' me the eye
How was I to know now how will I explain
With a Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde up in my brain
