TWELVE STEPS TO ROCK N ROLL

Gimme twelve steps to rock-n-roll
I'm gonna lose all my self control
I gotta an idea I wanna share
You don't like it I just don't care

I wanna run
To the surface of the sun
I don't trust anyone
Cause my whole world's come undone, again

Gimme twelve steps to rock-n-roll
I was born with an evil soul
I'm gonna give in to my desire
And walk right down into the fire
