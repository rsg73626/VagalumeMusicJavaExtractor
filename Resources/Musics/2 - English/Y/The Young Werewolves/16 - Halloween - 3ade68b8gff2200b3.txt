HALLOWEEN

It's Halloween
So pick up your candy
But be prepared
It's from the cemetery
Poisoned apples
And tricks unseen
Come inside
'Cause it's Halloween

Halloween

The door is shut
So start your screaming
You can't escape
Your soul is never leaving
Spells of witchcraft
And tricks unseen
Say your prayers
'Cause it's Halloween
