RUN AWAY

Here comes the fun
Now the sun is gone
I'll be the only one to show you the way

I know we're in demand
Your fate is in our hands
I'll be your only friend
You'll never get away

Run away from yourself too far
You're another falling star
Run into the night, run away tonight

'Cause the night is mine
You're on borrowed time
And you've crossed the line
With the things you said

Now you seem confused
Like it's something new
You gotta pay those dues
When you're with the dead
