WOLFABILLY BLUES

Look at me, actin' loud
Cashin' in, so proud
Could it be, yes it could
I forgot my old neighborhood
I'm singin' songs and I'm winnin' awards
Such money you could make with a couple of chords

I never knew nothin' but I bet
The werewolves are comin' so you better get and go

Here I go and you can too
If there's somethin' you wanna do
Be prepared to do the time
Even though you didn't do the crime
I live my life and it's so subversive
Tryin' to survive on the social service

How about a Caesar salad
Or do you find it a bit invalid
Look at me actin' loud
Could I be ill endowed
To know the world you gotta lose your soul
But who is really ready to fall in the fold
