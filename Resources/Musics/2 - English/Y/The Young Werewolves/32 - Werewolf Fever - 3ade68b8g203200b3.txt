WEREWOLF FEVER

All I wanna do is shout the truth
And all I really need is a little proof
And when I'm on the stage I get a feelin' inside
I got a werewolf fever
Oh help me survive

Is there somethin' you'd like to do
Like a midnight raid on a chicken coop
Oh help me out I got a feelin' for you
I got a werewolf fever
Oh help me survive

What good are your fangs if you don't use 'em
I'm sick of my choices so why should I choose 'em
I wait all night for the time to arrive
I got a werewolf fever
Oh help me survive

Like an army in chaos
A band in retreat
Jump to the drum
And get on your feet
I sing a new song
No poet has sung
I did all my hanging
What's left to be hung
