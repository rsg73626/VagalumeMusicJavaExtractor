HOLLYWOOD

Hollywood, La and Tinsel Town
The City of Angels burning to the ground
People everywhere are dreaming of fame
Werewolf fever it's all the same

Bright lights, big city, image check
Fast cars like dreams about to wreck
Promises are made but you might get burned
Take a look at history and you will learn

Movie producers and record execs
Sign the dotted line and let the money collect
Black cat lawyers are still in control
Everyone in Hollywood's an evil soul

Wolves and zombies in the graveyard of love
Buried temptation now rising above
People 'cross the world are feelin' it too
Psycho rock-n-roll wolfabilly blues
