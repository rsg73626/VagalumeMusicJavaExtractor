GOOD, BAD, MISUNDERSTOOD

Trashin' current fashion is the latest word
They say it's much better to be seen than to be heard

Ridin' all over your neighborhood
Sayin' much more than you ever should

Good, bad, misunderstood

Cashin' in my passion while I'm not too old
They say it's much better to be bought than to be sold

Like a little lost lamb in the deep dark wood
The big bad wolf and red riding hood

Good, bad, misunderstood

Wham, bam Son of Sam
Seventeen bodies in a big white van
Stop, drop, get on top
Before they lick the cream off the cream of the crop

I'm smashin' and I'm mashin' up the latest word
They say it's much better to be felt than to be heard

Like a little lost lamb in the deep dark wood
The big bad wolf and red riding hood

Good, bad, misunderstood

I'm smashin' and I'm mashin' up the latest trend
They say it's much better to be cool than to offend

C'mon, c'mon baby like you know you could
Get low, down and dirty like you know you should

Good, bad, misunderstood
