SHAPESHIFTER

Everybody's prowlin' on the streets tonight
There's a change comin' with the moonlight
Werewolves are walkin' down the avenue
Temptation burnin' up inside of you
Everybody's howlin' at the moon tonight
Shapeshifter, I'm a shapeshifter

Once again the moon it's rising high
Burnin' through that blackened velvet sky
Werewolves are walkin' down the avenue
Temptation burnin' up inside of you
Everybody's howlin' at the moon tonight
