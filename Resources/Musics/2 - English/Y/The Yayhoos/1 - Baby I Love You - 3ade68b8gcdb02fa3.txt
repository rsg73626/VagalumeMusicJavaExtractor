BABY I LOVE YOU

Well you know I said I'd love you for all time. 
Well sometimes I just can't believe you're mine. 
But every now and then 
I'm ready to say when 
Oh, baby I love you, just leave me the fuck alone. 

Well in your arms is where I'll always stay 
But something deep inside says not today 
Well i'll be sitting here 
working on this beer 
Oh baby I love you, just leave me the fuck alone. 

I try so hard each day 
to make things go away 
there's nothing left to say for tonight 

For a couple of days I won't be comming round 
I'm going to go get lost, I think I might skip town 
Now I don't mean to pout 
but you plain wore me out 
Oh baby I love you, just leave me the fuck alone. 

Oh, baby I love you, just leave me the fuck alone 
I tried dancing, I just want to go home 
I know your cooking's great 
But dinner will have to wait 
Oh, baby I love you, just leave me the fuck alone 

Well I'm in a frazzled state 
the party will have to wait 
Oh, baby I love you, just leave me the fuck alone.
