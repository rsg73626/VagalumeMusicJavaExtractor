STRAWBERRY DRINK FOREVER

I’ve got a bottle of vodka over my bed 
I’ve got a lot of tequilas messin my head
I got a lot of friends that I forget 
But I don’t care 

I’ve a got a bottle of scotch over my chair 
Lot of people says why don’t you cut your hair 
I don’t think my life is very fair 
But I don’t care 

Life is easy when you get high 
Troubles will pass when you get high
Get high high high high

Friend of mine says drink and roll 
My mamma always told me don’t lose control 
Sorry (mamma) but you’ll never know
That I don’t care

A Liverpool boy with big nose 
Told us livin is easy with eyes closed 
Later with my hangover I supposed
He never cared

Life is easy when you get high 
Troubles will pass when you get high
Get high high high high

Sorry but you’ll never know 
My mamma always loses her control 
Once she hit me with her bottle
She’s not so fair…

A Liverpool boy it’s under my bed
He took a shot through his head (some motherfucker shot in his head)
I drunk a lot and I forget
That he never cared

Life is high, when you get easy
Troubles will pass when you get easy
Get easy easy easy easy



Friend of mine it’s over my bed
I’ve got a friend sitting in my chair
He looks so funny with that hair
My momma always told me she’s not fair
But I don’t care
I’ve got a lot of painkillers doing my head  (I got a lot of tequila messing with my head)
