Every step i take iand so many moves i made and the point of rethinking.
This so little part i have and all the decisions i made i question where to? Rethinking.
Push, to kill the cultural pressure on this side means to grab the stars,
lay them down to the ground and dance on them.
This is a fullc ircle, that makes the circle and so many million lifes. I do try to continue,
to learn what this full circle means for myself. We are just a few cells, each one of us.
And i do try to understand the facilities of a working body to a growing mind.
I Try! We can dance, do we?
