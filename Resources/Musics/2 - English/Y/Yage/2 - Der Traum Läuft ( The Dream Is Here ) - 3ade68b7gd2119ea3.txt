DER TRAUM LÄUFT ( THE DREAM IS HERE )

Sometimes the time is there and a dream becomes reality.
In the own life in front of the own door.
And the eyes are open.
Keep it and built it up.Thats what is difficult and the art for eachone,
in front of the own door.
And the eyes are open.
You are what you are and what you do is what you´re doing.
Is it crosswise? The escape to reach the own goal. i need more.
And the eyes are open.
Sometimes the time is there and a dream becomes reality.
Keep on going, through courage.
