ROLLING SPRINGS

If i could, i would
I'll fly to the moon
Starway to nowhere
Vision of you
Imagine it could be real
So real that I could feel

I want my hour
I keep my time
I want my hour
I want my time

Drinking water from inside
Feel the hunger light the night
Leaving places, leaving times
Look for dreams, you cannot find

I want my hour
I want my time
I want my hour
I keep my time

Burn my body by the highway side
So my spirit can get a ride
Every place inside time
all those things not so fine

I want my hour 
I want my hour
I want my hour
I want my time
