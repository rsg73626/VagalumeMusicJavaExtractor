TSELFIK

I got a line on you
And it's coming through
'Cause I'm feeling high
but I don't mind
'Cause I got no fear
This will disappear
While the sun shines
I can always fly

Tselfik you
I'm tselfik you
I'm tselfik you

If you had your line
On primetime
What would you say
Make us feel this way
Do your friends know
How to let go
Then you can show them how
Just by living now

Tselfik you
I'm tselfik you
I'm tselfik you

Tselfik you
I'm tselfik you
I'm tselfik you
I'm tselfik you
I'm tselfik you
