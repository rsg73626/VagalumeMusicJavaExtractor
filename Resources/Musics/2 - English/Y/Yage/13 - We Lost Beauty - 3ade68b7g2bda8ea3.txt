WE LOST BEAUTY

How and why is this potential aggression in our hands?
Conciuosness transfered to foreign. Same we are.
Look as you are feel like? Feel as you are look like? But where do we found ourselves?
Mainly embed ina fantastic system. Conciousness?
And scared we walk on. Scared of ourselves. Scared by reasons ans nothing.
Did you sent a smile to an unknown face today?
Did you recieve a smile today?
How and why is this potential aggression in our hands?
Consupmtion binds the eyes and we buy numbness! Can you be yourself?
Is it still blood floating through or veins? Can i be myself or is it the newest trend
that makesa million hearts beat. To find myself!
Are you scared to smile? I know it is trivial, but somehow essential!
