DIE FLUCHT (THE ESCAPE)

Why isn´t it possible for you, to doubt your egoism, killings, greed to money and your selfdestruction?
You are damned by blindness, but you just take my light.
I hate you.
I hate you because i have to escape from you and your world, to live a life that doesn´t carry your hell.
And i´m conciousness about screaming YOU!!!
