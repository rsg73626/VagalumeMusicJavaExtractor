ENGINE OFF

Is there a new life for us to buy? When the engine is dead of numbness and rust.
Is there a life, when the engine is dead of false cloured beautiness in a fake plastic world
and everything is coloured in big happy eyes and outside itÂ´s grey in no plastic eyes.
When the engine is dead and eyes are closed and plastic coloured beautiness colours the eyes.
And plastic coloured beautiness brings a new life.
When the engine is dead!
And plastic coloured beautiness brings a new life!!!
