THE HUMAN HEAD TOO STRONG FOR ITSELF

To discuss to speak to eachother. So far from what is natural.
Is too sick to laugh about it and the crown of fanaticism
is the black side of the human sence.
Is too sick to laugh about it and the crown of fanaticism
grown in helpless heads.
Born under construction, born for not oneÂ´s life, a own life.
Puppet of stupidness exists through emptyness,
the engine through blindness.
And history burns and history still kills.
