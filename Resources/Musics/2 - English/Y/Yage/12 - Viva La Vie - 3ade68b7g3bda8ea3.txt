VIVA LA VIE

The new day forgotten because the next day passed by already
The days run and you recognize it when it is dark outside
Time is Cash
No time is life
Somtimes betrayed throuh the own mind
To live is the sense
But, because the earth is still turning people work on
We against us and you just for yourself
You for the end
But since it is still turning everything is o.k. isnÂ´t it
But by the sky, keep on wearing the blinders and make the best out of it.
Make the best out of it.
