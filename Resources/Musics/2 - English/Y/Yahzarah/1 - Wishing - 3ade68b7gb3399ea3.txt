WISHING

Tell me that a dream come true, cause I'm wishing on a star

Writing our names down in the notebook, like high school
My name first, your name last
You got me feeling like first love
While I work my 9 to 5, I ain't get nothing done
Steady slacking, tryna find words that describe you

Like wishing upon a star, (yeah)
Following wherever you are
Swim deep cross the deep blue sea (yeah)
Just to show the strength of my love (my love)

Like the first time making love that leaves you so shook
I slept on you now you know you got me so hooked
Telling you my business, and drinking out your glass
I got a long term crush on you, and there's no turning back (Cause I'm)

Wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love

You've got me picking at two's off daises talking bout "He loves me (he loves me), he loves me not (he loves me not)"
Got me singing the beginnings to happy endings, cause we gon make it
Ain't no one who can take it (yeah)

Like wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love
(Repeat 2 more times)

I'd walk the desert land (ooh), I'd swim the, I'd swim the ocean,
I'd climb the tallest mountain (highhh yeah, highhh yeah)
