LAST TO KNOW

Many people in a crowded room.
I just sit there and stare.
17 years until you go.
It just reminds me that your not there.


Trying hard to remember,
all those things you said to me.
Sun horizon, I gotta go,
But why am I the last to know?


People thank me for my gratitude,
as i walk down a dead end road.
Don't blame me for my attitude.
Don't blame me if I wanna go.
