I DON'T CARE

When i'm out and about and i hear a shout.
Start running away and round about.
Quarter past five, i'm feeling alive,
Thinking of the past and my future life, today...


Is the day when the sun's gonna shine.
Everybody's life signed on the dotted line.
Quarter past five, i'm feeling shite.
Stopped thinking of my past and my future life, today...


So when i've got sore feet and my brain is feeling beat,
Will you stay with me and we'll look at all the pretty patterns on the street.
I'll walk your cat and your dog through the rain and the fog,
When it's pissing it down, i'll never frown if your at my home.
(some people come and go but when my life's at a low,
Only you can pick me up, only you can dust me off, take me right back home)
There's nothing you lack. i'll never stab you in the back,
And you'll stay with me and then look at all the pretty patterns on the street.
What's on the street?


Thinking about yesterday, everybody's the same,
They turn around and thank you, thanks the same...i don't care.
You can take your thanks and cash it in at the bank
Place it on a bet at the dog tracks where it's wet...i don't care.
Thinking about cash you make it's all give and no take
They turn around and thank you, but that's fake...i don't care.
No i don't care. i dont care
