KIWI SYMPHONY

Your two steps from the front and I'm one step from the back.
My brain starts to rot,
My mind fades to black.
My life's in retribution, I've got the taxman on my back.
Philosophy of destruction.
Forever in contact.


Life's getting harder every day...


But I've got my kiwi symphony, yeah, yeah.
Life just gets hard on me, yeah, yeah


It brightens up my only dark.
I've got my kiwi symphony, yeah, yeah.
Got my kiwi symphony.
