LO DOWN

Can you tell what I want?
Well I think you do.
Coz everytime I see your face,
I see your face,
I shine thru...

I've been walking down this street so many times
The pavement's wearing thin
The souls of my shoes say I've been missing
I'm singing the lo down blues...

...Singing the lo down blues

Can you tell what I want?
Well I dont think you can.
It's all just a waste of time
I'll stay inside
I'm just like a man...

There's more ways, more ways than one
The gypsy woman dehydrates in the sun
With copius amounts of rock, sex and booze
Thru all this, I see you...

I'm singing the lo down blues
I'm singing the lo down blues
I'm singing the lo down blues

Can you tell what i want?
Can you tell what i want?

I've been walking down this street so many times
The pavement's wearing thin
The souls of my shoes say I've been missing
I'm singing the lo down...

There's more ways, more ways than one
The gypsy woman dehydrates in the sun
With copius amounts of rock, sex and booze
Thru all this, I see you...

Singing the lo down blues
Singing the lo down blues
Singing the lo down blues
I'm just singin the lo down blues
