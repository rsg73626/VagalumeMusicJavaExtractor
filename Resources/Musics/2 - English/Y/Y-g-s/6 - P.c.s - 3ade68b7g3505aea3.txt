P.C.S

Dont listen to me (Dont listen to me)
Coz I dont know what I'm saying

Dont give me that shit (Dont give me that shit)
Coz I dont know

Running on empty
Running On empty

Coz I've been searching for a drink
And I'm not giving up on this
Coz drink and music is my catalyst
That's bringing out my P.C.S

I'm gonna leave (I've gotta leave)
Coz I'm getting grief from you

Dont gimme your grief (Dont gimme your grief)
I've heard that excuse before

Running on empty
Running On empty

Coz I've been searching for a drink
And I'm not giving up on this
Coz drink and music is my catalyst
That's bringing out my P.C.S

I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
But I've got my friends with me

Wasting my youth (Wasting your youth)
And now it has gone for good

Running on empty
Running On empty

Coz I've been searching for a drink
And I'm not giving up on this
Coz drink and music is my catalyst
That's bringing out my P.C.S
