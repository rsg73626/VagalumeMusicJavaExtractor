HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE RAIN?

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know 
It's been coming for some time

When it's over, so they say 
It'll rain a sunny day
I know
Shinin' down like water 

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hot
I know
Been that way for all my time

'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow 
I know
It can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain? 
I wanna know 
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
Yeah!

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain? 
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
