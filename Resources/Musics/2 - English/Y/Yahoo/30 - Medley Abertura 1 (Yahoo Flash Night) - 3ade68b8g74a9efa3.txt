MEDLEY ABERTURA 1 (YAHOO FLASH NIGHT)

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (Joey Tempest)

We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back,
To Earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown
The final countdown

We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all
With so many light years to go and things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.

It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown

FAR FROM OVER (Vince Di Cola / Frank Stallone)

This is the end
You made your choice and now my chance is over
I thought I was in
You put me down and say I'm goin' nowhere

Save me darlin'
I am down but I am far from over
Give me somethin'
I need it all 'cause I am runnin' over

Back in the race
I'm movin' in 'cause I am getting closer
I'm diggin' in
I want it more than anything I've wanted

Save me darlin'
I am down but I am far from over
Give me somethin'
I need it all 'cause I am runnin' over
I'm runnin' over
I'm runnin' over

OWNER OF A LONELY HEART (Trevor Rabin / Jon Anderson/ Chris Squire / Trevor Horn)

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now 
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself 
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
After my own decision
They confused me so
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go 
Look before you leap
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all, no no

Owner of a lonely heart
Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
wner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
