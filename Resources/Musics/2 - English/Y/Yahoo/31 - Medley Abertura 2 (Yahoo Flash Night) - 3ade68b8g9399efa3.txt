MEDLEY ABERTURA 2 (YAHOO FLASH NIGHT)

YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME (Richard Sambora / Jon Bon Jovi / Desmond
Child)

Shot to the heart and you're to blame
Darlin' you give love, a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa! 
You're a loaded gun
Yeah, whoa...
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shyY
ou very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Whoa!
You're a loaded gun
Whoa...
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

JUMP (Alex Van Halen / David Lee Roth/ Edward Van Halen / Michael Anthony)

I get up,
And nothing gets me down
You got it tough,
I've seen the toughest around
And I know
Baby just how you feel
You've got to ro-o-oll with the punches and get to what's real

Ah Can't you see that standing here I got my back against the record machine?
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah Can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well Jump (Jump!)
Might as well Jump
Go ahead and Jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and Jump

A-oh, hey you, who said that,
Baby how you been?
You say you don't you don't kno-o-ow
You won't know until you're deep in

Ah Can't you see that standing here I got my back against the record machine?
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah Can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well Jump (Jump!)
Might as well Jump
Go ahead and Jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and Jump

Jump!

BEAT IT (Michael Jackson)

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
