SHE NEEDS MY LOVE (FEAT DAMIAN MARLEY)

I Jr.Gong long side Yami Bolo 
Come to tell you a little story about the girl next door 
Certain tings can happen but she will never know 
Unless she come ah di Rasta man stage show 
I Jr.Gong man have the love connection 
Come fi sail like a big boat across the ocean 
So come and get yourself inna di love motion 
You have di Rastaman wid di love potion 

She needs my love 
She said she needs my love 
She need my love 
She said she need Jah love 

She is a girlfriend 
She live next door 
I think I've seen her 
That face before 
Her memories can't 
Erase from my mind 
I love ya angel 
One of a kind 

Well den she see me and she ball out 
YO !! Jr.Gong 
Di searching shall end 
Where the searching begun 
She need a bed room bully 
Who's a real rangatan 
She love me like how black yankee 
Love Farrakhan 
Well she's very impressed 
With the youngest veteran 
She started realizing 
There's no better man 
Now when time rain a fall 
I become di weather man 
Performing every one of 
Her stage show dem fi long 
I beg ya pardon deh 
Miss kinky walking 
Bright like sunlight 
When me glimpse you dis morning 
Come down to night 
You ah mi moon shine darling 
Mash up mi head 
All when ah you mi eye balling 
Ready fi di hundred 
With out no stalling 
Ince comes the youngest 
Signal and warning 
Big trampoline 
For di bedroom brawling 
Cause she's not just 
Good she's appalling 
Her performances 
Deserve applauding 

Tell her fi link it 
Me nah sink it 
To piece and bit 
When it come down to loving 
It's a perfect fit 
Whole heap ah more loving 
And we just nah quit 
She can't tek the vibe 
Of Babylon dem spirit 
Straight up loving 
And ah nah no bull 
Ah Rastafari bless her 
With di ting she have 
She have all right reserve 
Fi she galang bad 
Fresher than a vegetable 
Inna mi market bag 
Any time she come link up me ends 
Me glad 
Well ah she a get di money 
And a spend di wad 
Cuase me know the chumpas 
Will not be squandered 
She mek me start sing 
Some Ray Charles ballad 
Cause the style of the loving 
Is not just a fad 

She need a lover 
To hug and squeeze her tight 
She need a man to 
Come home at night 
But he's always working 
That's what she say 
I had to tell her 
Go home and pray
