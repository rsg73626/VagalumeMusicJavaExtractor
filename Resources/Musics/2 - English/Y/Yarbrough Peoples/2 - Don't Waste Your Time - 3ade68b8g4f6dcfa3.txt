DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME

Don't waste your time
She's my friend
I tell you
She ain't no good

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
Knowing I care about you
The way I do

So don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good
Don't waste your time

Each and every night
Bragging how she takes love
But never gives it back

So don't waste your time
