DON'T STOP THE MUSIC

Don't you stop it
Don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you know
You've got me mesmerized
With the beat
I always fantasize

Don't stop the music
'Cause it tends to soothe
I can tell you want to groove

Don't you stop it
Don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it
(The beat keeps going round and round)
Don't you stop
(Turns me upside down)
Don't stop the music

I just wanna rock you (oh, baby)
All night long (to my love song)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just wanna rock
(I just wanna rock you)
All night long (yeah)
I've got a love song
(Whoa, whoa, whoa...)

Everything we do
Is right on time
The beat's so smooth
It blows my mind

Don't stop the music
It's so satisfying
It feels so good to me
There is no denying

Just because it's two o'clock
Don't stop the music
Log on to kill this message.
Don't you feel like
Dancing and prancing
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it
Don't you stop
Don't stop the music

You don't really wanna stop, no
You don't really wanna stop, uh uh
You don't really wanna stop, no
You don't really wanna stop

You've got me moving
You've got me grooving
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it
Don't you stop
Don't stop the music

(I just wanna rock you)
I just wanna rock you
(All night long)
All night long

(I just wanna rock you)
I just wanna rock you
(All night long)
All night long
(Love song, love song)
(Love song, love song)

I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie
(Boogie)

Don't you stop it
(You don't really wanna stop, no)
Don't you stop
Don't stop the music
(You don't really wanna stop, uh huh)

Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop
(Don't stop)

Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop
(Don't stop)
