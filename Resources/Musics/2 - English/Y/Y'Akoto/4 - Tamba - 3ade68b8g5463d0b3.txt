TAMBA

Your name is Tamba, the bush is your home
You don't have no money, no food, no family, no home
The rebels have killed your mommy and daddy
The government, you still say is your worst enemy

Hello?
Tamba is dying
Get up
Do you hear him crying?
Hello?
See, I would be lying
If I said that everything would be alright

We see your face on the television
Your big wide eyes and your hopeless condition
Afraid because your country is in tension
And all these politicians make war but no solutions

Hello?
Tamba is dying
Get up
Do you hear him crying?
Hello!
See, I would be lying
If I said that everything would be alright

All the kid soldiers in Liberia
I send you love, may you walk tall
All the kid soldiers all over Africa
I give you strength and my confidence
All the kid soldiers in Uganda
May you be free for eternity
All the kid soldiers
No kid soldiers

Hello?
Tamba is dying
Get up!
Do you hear him crying?
Hello!
See, I would be lying
If I said that everything would be alright
(Sing along, you'll walk tall)
