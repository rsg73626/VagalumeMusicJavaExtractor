GOOD BETTER BEST

A little bird needs help to fly
Mamma pushes her out of the nest
And says "Try, try try! "
Even though she is afraid
She spreads her wings
Without looking down
Oh oh
She hits the ground hard and loud
And mamma says
"Welcome to life, darling"

Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee why is life this way?
Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee why is life this way?

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Even though she is afraid
You can feel that she is great
When she struggles to come off the ground
Oh oh
Fail, follow, and try
Again and again and again
And you don't have to be afraid
To fail little baby girl

Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee why is life this way?
Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee why is life this way?

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Yeah, tell me why?
Yeah, I will try, try
Again, again, again, again
And I will try
Again, again

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best

Good better best
May I never rest
Until my good is better
And my better best
