BABYBLUES

The love of my life pushed me down a valley
Disappeared and never showed up again
And now he's in love with a very old lady
A woman who's ten years older than me
Oh I cursed, and then killed
And one drink after the other
I was sure I would never recover

She's probably everything I never was
A rich pretty face and very mature
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death, what a ****ing surprise

But she shouldn't hate me, she should pity me
Cause she took away the best part of my existence, you see
The man I love in the arms of a very old lady
A woman who's ten years older than me

She's probably everything I never was
A rich pretty face and very mature
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death, what a ****ing surprise

And as I drown myself in toxic tears
I question the use of all these years
He left me hanging till he let go of my wrist
I saw them walking down the street and back when they kissed
And now my dead body is doing the best again
Gonna find myself a very old man

She's probably everything I never was
A rich pretty face and very mature
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death, what a ****ing surprise

She's probably everything I never will be
A rich pretty face and ready for maternity
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death, what a ****ing surprise
