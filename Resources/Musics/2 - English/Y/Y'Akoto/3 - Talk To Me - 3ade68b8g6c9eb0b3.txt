TALK TO ME

My bae
(My bae)

I don't wanna change you
I think you're quite ok
You're strong, elegant, and warm
But you keep all the good stuff away from me
Your outward appearance is slick
And what you say
And the way you say it sounds terrific
OO... boy
But I'm interested in the silence between your lines
Open up boy
And let your thoughts fly

Talk to me, talk to me, let me in
I want to know how it's like
Under your skin
Talk to me, talk to me, let it go
Trust me love, let yourself go
(Let it go)

So please don't protect me
I'm here to take it all in
And to share your tears
Trust me love, oh oo... yeah
I am strong and my heart's got all this space
For your stories
Come on, have faith in me
See, I'm not a hero but I can take in all the pain
And I'mma cry with you but then I'll smile with you again

Talk to me, talk to me, let me in
I want to know how it's like under your skin
Talk to me, talk to me, let it flow
Trust me love, let it go, let it go
Yeah

Let's give us a chance
Let's open up and let our feelings dance
Come on dance, ah
OO
Let's give love a chance
Let's open up
And let our feelings dance

Talk to me, talk to me!
Let me in!
I want to know how it's like under your skin!
Talk to me, talk to me, let it go!
Trust me love, let it flow, let it go

Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, ha
Talk to me, come on love, come talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, me, me
