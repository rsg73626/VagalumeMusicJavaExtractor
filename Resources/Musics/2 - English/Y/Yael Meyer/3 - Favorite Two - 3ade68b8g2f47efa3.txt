FAVORITE TWO

Sun is shining what a lovely day
Birds are singing and that’s always great
But it’s better when I’m with you
My all time favorite two, my favorite two

Rainy days are also nice
Sound of rainfall and the cloudy skies
But it’s better when I’m with you
Everything is better when I’m with you
My favorite two, my favorite two

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I like traveling to crazy places
Meeting brand new people with brand new faces
But it’s better when I’m with you
Everything is better when I’m with you
My favorite two, my favorite two

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

Some days are no fun and I’m feeling blue
Singing a happy song just won’t do
But then I see you and you flash me a huge smile
And everything is better I can’t deny
Cause it’s better when I’m with you
My favorite two, my favorite two

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
