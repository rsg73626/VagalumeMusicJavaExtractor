RAIN FALLING

Sweet night is calling us to sleep
Right here beside me let me keep
You safe and warm
Don't be afraid, it's just a storm

Come lay beside me let me
Love you and tuck you gently
Sweet night is calling
Hear the rain falling

Let the sound sooth you tonight
I'm right here with you it's alright
Sweet night is calling
Just hear the rain falling
Hear the rain falling
