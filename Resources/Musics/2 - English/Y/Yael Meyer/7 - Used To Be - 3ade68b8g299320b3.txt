USED TO BE

Things are not the same way that they used to be
We're busy running around that is you and I baby
I wanna go stroll underneath the night sky
Watch the clouds as they swing by
Stay up late and talk about life
Like we used to do in another time

Things are not the same now that we've grown into our own
We built a home from nothing, built a life stone by stone
And I wanna take time to make time, to sit under the sunshine
And feel your heart against mine, feel your heart against mine

OO

I think about the days sometimes when I first saw your face
And thought you were the cutest one with the mysterious gaze
But never thought that day 
would be the first day of the rest of my life
With you

Things are not the same way that they used to be
But we will be fine babe
You and me
