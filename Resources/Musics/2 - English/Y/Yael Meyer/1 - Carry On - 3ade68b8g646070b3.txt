CARRY ON

How do you know when it is time to let go?
How can you tell when it is time to farewell?
All things have a season, it all comes to an end
It's hard to follow reason when the heart won't bend

How do you know when it is time to make a change?
How can you tell, when it all feels so strange?
To leave friends behind for unknown things to find
Whether it makes sense we will only learn in time

And you win some and you lose some
And there's no right or wrong
And you look back at what you used to have
But now it's all gone
So you give up or you make up
For what you have lost

And you carry on, carry on
You carry on, carry on
Yeah you carry on, carry on
You carry on, carry on

Yeah you carry on, carry on
You carry on, carry on
Yeah you carry on, carry on
You carry on, carry on

How do you know when it is time to move on
Throw away the keys and carry on, carry on?
'Cause love can lead to heartbreak
And love can lead to love
But my love won't break no matter where we go
My love won't break no matter where we go
My love is one that won't break no matter where we go
