I WONDER HOW

Surely I cannot imagine, what you must think of me now
Buried here beneath the rubble, all this unexpected trouble how
I wonder how, will we find it in our hearts
to forgive the misregards and doubts?

It's not the change that we expected
Nor something we protected for
Nobody prepared the plate
oh how could we have known what to wait for

Now we find ourselves at loss, in the midst of this great toss
and how, I wonder how?
If I don't even know within me
What it is that is still hindering me
from loving you like I do

Buried here beneath the rubble, all this unexpected trouble how
I wonder how, will we find it in our hearts
to forgive the misregards and doubts?
