GOOD THINGS ARE COMING MY WAY

Best things happen by surprise
There are no coincidences in my eyes
Some think there are no mistakes
And I believe everything is in the right place
So I don't mind what they say

Good things are coming my way
They're coming my way
They're coming my way
They're coming my way

A new turn in every corner
Keep working hard and it will come together one day
Good things come to those who wait
And I believe this is our fate so come on now it's never too late
And I don't mind what they say

Good things are coming my way
They're coming my way
They're coming my way
They're coming my way

So let's not worry about every little thing
The adventure begins now
It may not be as simple as it seems
But we fight day in and out anyhow

So I won't mind what they say
Not today, not any day

Good things are coming my way
They're coming my way
They're coming my way
They're coming my way
