WHEN YOU HOLD ME TIGHT

Love, it isn't just a dream
Now that you are everything to me
Oh love is the sweetest thing
I smile at every being with a skip in my heart
The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight
But I only have eyes for you and I'm home
When you hold me tight
Oh oh oh oh oh
When you hold me tight

Love, dazzling at first sight
Challenging now everything we thought we knew was right
Oh love, it is our destiny
We're caught up in the daze of only you and me
The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight
But I only have eyes for you and I'm home
When you hold me tight
Oh oh oh oh oh
When you hold me tight

Even through high tide and tempestuos rainfall
I'll be by your side with bated breath
And together we'll sail through it all
And together we'll sail through it all
Oh oh oh oh oh
And together we'll sail through it all
