ENDLESS KIND LOVE

It takes us by surprise to see with naked eyes
You were wrapped in a cocoon within my humble womb

In your eyes your naked eyes the world begins anew
In your heart your naked heart there's only love, an endless kind love

Breathing for the first time
Light and bright for the first time
Loud and proud for the first time
In my arms for the first time

In your eyes your naked eyes the world begins anew
And I will cradle safe your heart so full of love, an endless kind love
Endless kind love, endless kind love, endless kind love, endless kind love
Endless kind love, endless kind love, endless kind love
OO

'Cause in your eyes your naked eyes the world begins anew
In your heart your naked heart there's only love, an endless kind love
