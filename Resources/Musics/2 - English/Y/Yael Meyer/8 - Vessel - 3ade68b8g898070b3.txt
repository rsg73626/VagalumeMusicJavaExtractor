VESSEL

So we were created to complete that which was broken
So that we may come to see the truth
Blinding though may be the light that shines so bright I see it clearly
Guided me to open my heart to love

Oh what a chance to mend the right from wrong
Thank you for giving me a home

Lahalahane

Oh what a chance to mend the right from wrong
Thank you for giving me a home

So we were created to complete that which was broken
Oh what a chance, oh what a chance to elevate the world
