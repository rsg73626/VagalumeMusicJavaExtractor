WARRIOR HEART

I'm an uprooted tree
Please be kind with me
I'm lost and undefined
I've got a restless mind
And a warrior inside my heart

I'm an unfinished road
A bird that flies away from the cold
I'm a lover with no game
And I've got no one to blame
For the ailings in may warrior heart

So love me love me so
Love me like you can't let go
Love me even when I'm so hard to love
Love my warrior heart, love my warrior heart

You're like a gentle breeze
That begins to blow
Strong and wild and free
Very much like me
Very much like me

And all I want for you
Is that you know that my love is true
Pure and sweet and blind
Unchallenged, undefined
Ripe from the very start

And I will love you love you so
Love you more than you will ever know
Love you 'cause you're just so easy to love
I'll love your warrior heart, love your warrior heart

Love me love me so
Love me like you can't let go
Love me even when I'm so hard to love
Love my warrior heart, love my warrior heart
Love my warrior heart, love my warrior heart
