MY GIRL

The brightness of the night is beautiful
Because it is our girl brilliance
Moonlight accepts dance?

Let's sing until there is no more voice
Let's dance to lose the forces
We will fight until there was more pain
Only choice!

I will do what I can for you
Angel because her smile fascinates me
It's like the color of clouds
In contrast to the sky blue

The brightness of the night is beautiful
Because it is our girl brilliance
Moonlight accepts dance?
