20 SECONDS

20 seconds, your disconnected generation
Every day, every day i look around for you
Drug related complications, chronic online masturbation
Every night, every night i look around for you
20 seconds, you only get one first impression
Every day, every day i look around for you
I saw the tape with your confessions, a bit bizarre the situation
Every day, every day i look around for you

And it lifts me up but then it brings me down
You should get me up to speed on what?s going on
I?v been spending nights all over town
Just to find somebody who can ease my mind

20 seconds, 20 seconds
In my mind, in my mind i look around for you
20 seconds, 20 seconds
All the time, all the time i look around for you
20 seconds, your father fucking generation
In my mind, in my mind i look around for you
Sex related complications
All the time, all the time i look around for you
Of this prozac taking nation
On iphone applications

And it lifts me up but then it brings me down
You should get me up to speed on what?s going on
I?v been spending nights all over town
Just to find somebody who can ease my mind

In a cheap motel or a fancy car
On the dance floor baby or behind the bar
I got 20 seconds to sell what i got
You got half a lifetime to say if you want
