BE WITH YOU TONIGHT

A rainy day for all I care
I should be somewhere else
The sidewalk edge
The parking car, the chair

Hearing something that reminds me of
Your face
Easy listening gives a sweeter taste

I should be there with you
And do what I can do
Should find a faster train
Or taxi in the rain
I should be lying now
With you in bed somehow
Take a Sunday flight
And be with you tonight

Be with you tonight 
Be with you tonight 
Be with you tonight 
Be with you tonight 

Belonging's my
A troubled mind
I should be somewhere close
A camera case
The helping hand, the shame
Feeling something
That reminds me of
Your name
Modern music sounds our funny game

I should be there with you
And do what I can do
Should find a faster train
Or taxi in the rain
I should be lying now
With you in bed somehow
Take a Sunday flight
And be with you tonight

Be with you tonight
Be with you tonight
Be with you tonight
Be with you tonight

If I could be
Everything you need from me
I'll make you see
That I'm as good as I can be
Smile when you're empty
Someday we can be a house
If I could find
A simple way to get you here tonight

I should be there with you
And do what I can do
Should find a faster train
Or taxi in the rain
I should be lying now
With you in bed somehow
Take a Sunday flight
And be with you tonight

Be with you tonight 
Be with you tonight 
Be with you tonight 
Be with you tonight
