BAD BLOOD

Red blood red blood
You?re empty i?m sad
Red blood bad blood
You?re mommy i?m dad

White skin white skin
You don?t know the state i?m in
Red blood sweet cherry
And off to canada to marry

Red blood blue car
I want you close you keep me far
Bad blood good cop
Please let me in or kick me out

White skin big dick
You?re so nice it makes me sick
White skin back door
You?re getting harder to ignore

Red blood bad blood
Bad influence and way beyond
Red blood bad blood
I?ll call you betty if you call me al
