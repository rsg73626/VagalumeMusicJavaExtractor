P.O.P

Found what I needed to find
Guess i?m lucky way
Hide what i needed to hide
Won?t ever do it again
Ate what i needed to eat
Had so much fun with the princes of penn
Lied when i needed to lie
About where i?m from and even my name

When go up the numbers
It gets easier seeing the sun
And the edge of the city in front
Language is easy but talking is not
When you?re flying tomorrow
It gets easier seeing the end
Haven?t found what i needed to find
But i?m lucky this way i got you instead

Crushed what i needed to crush
Now i got blood on my hands
Tamed what i needed to tame
Now i?m bored and life isn?t the same
Then i fucked who i wanted to fuck
It was good but i?m empty inside
And i know it?s ok but i can?t stop
I can?t stop changing my mind

When go up the numbers
It gets easier seeing the sun
And the edge of the city in front
Language is easy but talking is not
When you?re flying tomorrow
It gets easier seeing the end
Haven?t found what i needed to find
But i?m lucky this way i got you instead

It?s so cold in this house and it?s killing me
There?s a tree in the yard i?v been meaning to climb
But the rain doesn?t stop and it?s hard to see
Where i?m putting my leg cause it?s dark after 5
My blessing is also my enemy
I?ll visit your church if i?ll know what it means
Love is the answer for everything
I found what i needed over and over again
