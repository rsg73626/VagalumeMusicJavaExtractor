ANGRY ALONE

You feel the need to be preacher
You feel the need to be strong
I feel the need to be empty
Your body and soul

I feel the need to be preacher
I feel the need to stay home
My empty mind should stay hungry
Angry alone

But i, just wanna connect with you
Show me your miracle mind
Just wanna be close to you
1 2 3 4 5

You feel the need to be preacher
And tell them when they are wrong
The golden neckless you?re wearing
When you?re taking me home

I feel the need to be famous
I?m gonna show you a game
You?re gonna give me your money
And your family name

Cause i, just wanna connect with you
Show me your miracle mind
Just wanna be close to you
1 2 3 4 5

[ I wanna be like, i be like you ]
[ I wanna feel like that too ]
