D.I.S.C.O

I, I wrote some letters on a paper in your house
It had a meaning no one else could figure out
D is for doing what I want
I is for saying that I can?t
S is for somebody you?re not
C for don?t call me and
O is for oh no

D.I.S.C.O(4x)

I, I left my finger prints and skin my empty mind
It had a reason no one else can make me cry
D is for darling you?re so hot
I inside you break my heart
S for sometime when you?re around
C is for curious and
O is for oh my god

D.I.S.C.O(4x)

Disco I love you but cannot forgive you
I want to believe you but you?ve hurt me before
There?s no explanation for all this attention
I should be strong and not open the door
