FAMILY VALUE

Family values, family value, i wanna be free i don?t wanna be like you
Family values, family value, mom is not living beside you
Family values, family value, i wanna be free i don?t wanna be like you
The guy with the tie will excuse me, cause i want you

Family values, family value, i wanna be free i don?t wanna be like you
Family values, family value, i know what i wanted to ask you
Family values, family value, sing me a song, i?m lying beside you
And god will excuse me, cause i love you

From your baseball bat to your fathers hat
The bible that seat near the bed where we sleep
The stolen black pen from the vegas hotel
There?s beauty in skin i don?t know if you see
There?s beauty in me it?s not bad as it seems

Family values, family value, i wanna stay true i don?t wanna be like you
Family values, family value, shame is not something i dance to
Family values, family value, i see in your eyes when i cum inside you
Nothing can keep us apart, not even a man with a stone for a heart

Family values, family value, i wanna have fun i don?t wanna be stuck to
A man who?ll happily love me, with a picture of jc above me
Family values, family value, i wanna be me i don?t wanna be lied to
But the moment you?ll leave me alone, i?ll beg you to call and make love on the phone
