YOUNG PROFESSIONAL

You spend my money and tell me I?m the only one
That i am funny and beautiful and in denial
You call me honey, you burn the toast the way i like
But i don?t but it, no, i think you?re smiling just a little bit
To much

Young professionals at work, neon lights that make you look
Tired if you?re not, sending emails feeling fine
Young professionals at work, neon lights that make you look
Tired even if you?re not, drinking coffee feeling fine

You have your dreams and i think that?s overrated too
We can go anywhere, there?s noting that we could do
You have my money, i feel like it?s the wrong cliche
But still it?s funny how i can make it go away

Young professionals at work, neon lights that make you look
Tired if you?re not, sending emails feeling fine
Young professionals at work, neon lights that make you look
Tired even if you?re not, drinking coffee feeling fine

Go for the weird go for the empty car
Go for the smoke, the elevation mark
Go for the weird the man with the funky hand
Go with the name, be careful about where you stand
