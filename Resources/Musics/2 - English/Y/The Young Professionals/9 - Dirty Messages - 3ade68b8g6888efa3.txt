DIRTY MESSAGES

I love it when you send me
Dirty pictures to my mail
The room is full of people and
I?m just smiling to myself

I?ll be going to the bathroom
Return a favor as they say
Thank god my phone?s connected
And there?s no password on the net

Every second in a minute
That we breath and call ?our life?? [ you're not alone ]
Should be exciting as we make it
Cause when you give me love i take it

I love it when you send me
Funny faces messages
Love when we?re acting stupid
Cause we don?t care

What other people are thinking
Judging every move i make
All rules meant to be broken
Show me baby if you can

Every second in a minute
That we breath and call ?our life?? [ you're not alone ]
Should be exciting as we make it
Cause when you give me love i take it
