DESERVE

Traveling into europe
Hotel to hotel
Seeing people and I don?t wanna tell you
Stuff about it
Food or poison in my veins
You can trick me into anything if you shine away

Traveling into myself
Hotel to hotel
Creepy crawlers, maybe i need help to
Understand it
Love and anger in my head
You can trick me into anything just shine away

You deserve something better than me
Someone who remembers that he loves you so
You deserve someone stronger than me
Who doesn?t need a drink to tell you that he wants to

Baggage in a subway
Hotel to hotel
Seeing faces and i don?t wanna write those
Songs about it
Bullshit running thru my brain
You can get me into anything if you shine away

I?m traveling into chaos
Hotel to hotel
Loving people and maybe i need help to
Being over
Life in execution mode
You can love me into anything if you?re brave enough

You deserve something better than me
Someone who remembers that he loves you so
You deserve someone stronger than me
Who doesn?t need a drink to tell you that he wants to

You deserve something better than me
Someone who can promise that he loves you
And when you?re gone that?s who i wanna be
But i don?t really know if i can
