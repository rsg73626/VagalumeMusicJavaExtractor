WAKE UP

The buildings on burning
The city on fire
And people are running away from it all

Wake up

Time to say something
Show your opinion
Making it grow you know

Wake up

Like an animal sensing smell like
The future people are looking for something to hold

Wake up

The dreaming is over
Somebody is waiting, prayin and crying predicting the fall

Wake up

Talk to your people give them a reason something to hold, old
Live life nothing is easy forgive me
Believe me i dont want you to leave me, please
