UNTITLED

Does it even bother you?
To know you left me here
Wondering and waiting
When I would see you again
I guess not
Since you didn't even bother to call
An image of me is probably a blur in your selfish mind
My feelings are at stake

I gave you my heart
The only thing I had to give
What do I have to lose?
Everything...
And what about you?
Nothing...
Thats what I thought
This must be the end

Does it even faze you?
To know how much I'm hurting
Your salutation was all I needed
You could have saved me
If you had only loved me
It hurts too much to fall in love
With happiness comes pain

I gave you my heart
The only thing I had to give
What did I have to lose?
Everything...
And what about you?
Nothing...
Thats what I thought
This must be the end

So it must not bother you
To know I'm still here
Still wondering and waiting
I don't think I'll see you again
I knew it
I never got your call
There must not be any image of me in your selfish mind
I can't feel anymore
