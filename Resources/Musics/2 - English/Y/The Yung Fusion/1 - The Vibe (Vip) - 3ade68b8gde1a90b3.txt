THE VIBE (VIP)

[Verse 1: Yung fusion]
I be that young rapping dude
Might just trap with you
Coming with the thunder baby
Might just clap ya' crew
I roll out in the morning light
Whip that harley bike
All black, I'm the party type
And it's on tonight
I just stepped no weapons
But my outfit might take ya soul
See my presence impressive
Got strippers slipping off of poles
I just whip then I swerve em
Wish you would I'm timmy tuner
Turned her to a carnivore
Now she treat me like a burger

[Hook] x2
I don't their names but, they all wanna ride
All this energy around me, I feel so alive
This must be the vibes x3
Cause I feel so alive

[Verse 2]
I got a fresh cut in the denims
All these sexy genes in my section
And if a nigga wanna run up
Boy get done up by the confessor damn
Slide into yo dm's in the pm and am
Then I slide into your feelings
When you see just what I'm saying
I ain't ever tryna front
Imma' show you girl wassup
You can show me what is love
Then we ride of in the sun
Damn, this must be movie cause we directing the fun
And producing weekend music
But the credits never come
[Hook] x2

[Outro verse]
Speakers popping like soda
Make em turn up and over
I'm the slickest in here
Thats why she kissing the cobra
And I feel so alive
All these girls going wild
And its all in my jungle
I see they all feeling vibes
So bring yo girl
