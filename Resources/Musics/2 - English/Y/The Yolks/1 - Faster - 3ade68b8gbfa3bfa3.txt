FASTER

I feel it inside
I feel it inside my body
Something is wrong
Something is wrong
Affraid of the light
Affraid of the city so
Stay close to me
Stay close to me

I just need to go outside
Run away to feel alive
And all I wanna do
Is keep on movin' with you
I don't wanna go back there anymore
'Cause I'm too affraid to
Open again that door

I feel it around
I feel it in the air
Something is wrong
Something is wrong
Affraid of the mob
Affraid of the city so
Stay close to me
Stay close to me

I just need to go outside
Run away to feel alive
And all I wanna do
Is keep on movin' with you
I don't wanna go back there anymore
'Cause I'm too affraid to
Open again that door

Keep movin'
Keep movin'
Faster
Faster
Keep movin'
Keep movin'
Faster, faster, Faster, faster !
