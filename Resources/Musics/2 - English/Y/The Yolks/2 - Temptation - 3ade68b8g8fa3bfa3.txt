TEMPTATION

We were introduced at a birthday party
But I couldnt know yet how addicted I would be
I didnt want to get old or bald, I was trying to flee
And then without warning, you had just picked me

I shiver cause Im not with you
The drop of sweat running down my spine
That refuse to dry, that wont tell me why
You dont even give me a clue


I should have gone on a cruise, to take some time to heal my bruise
To breath some air and stop to lose, to reach my lair and drink some booze
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation


Ive lost my way passing through her eyes
I was running, then hypnotized
She gathered all the ingredients of everything I hate
But mixed to this rate, it made an excellent cake

Tender and sweet, barely warm but tasty
I should not have been too greedy
Eventually Id have cold turkey
Addicted before getting started


I should have gone on a cruise, to take some time to heal my bruise
To breath some air and stop to lose, to reach my lair and drink some booze
Temptation
