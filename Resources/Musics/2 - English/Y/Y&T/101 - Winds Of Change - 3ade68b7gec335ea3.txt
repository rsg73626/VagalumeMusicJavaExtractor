WINDS OF CHANGE

Look to the stars tonight
To find all that I need
Still there's no sign of the answer
That I seek
Gaze through the window
Of all the faces unknown
Cold, dark, and empty eyes
With so far to go
I found the word inside my head
No longer turns
It's lonely emptiness
Within me that burns
But still I'm searching
Searching madly
For the reason of the rhyme
If I could find the answer
I'd have it for all time

I can't wait for tomorrow
I can't wait for the stars or the sun or the seas
to guide me
I can't wait for tomorrow
Yet I know that I'll find

Winds of change
blowing strongly
Winds of change
whispering..

Deep in my heart
I'll find where to start
and follow the light to the end
And the truth will be told
for the young and the old
as the winds of change will blow
Never, never, never lonely
Standing on your own
You'll face the fears of all of your years
And finally it's you that you know
You can't wait for tomorrow
You can't wait for the stars or the sea or the sun
to shine on you
You can't wait for tomorrow
Listen for,
You, you better listen for

Winds of change
blowing strongly
Winds of change
whispering..
Winds of change
blowing, blowing, blowing strongly
Winds of change
whispering..

Solo: Dave Meniketti

whispering..
blowing strongly
whispering..
blowing strongly
Seas, whispering
Sun's shining on me
When the west wind blows
and it's time for me to go
in the Winds Of Change

Whispering...
