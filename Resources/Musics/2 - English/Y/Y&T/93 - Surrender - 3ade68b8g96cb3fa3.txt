SURRENDER

I’ve got to talk about it
I’ve got to let you know
Tonight’s the night to let my feelings show
Can’t stop thinkin’ ‘bout it
Oh, I’ve been up all night
Just wonderin’ if you’ll take it wrong or right
Oh, I can’t hold back
I didn’t know that
I—could feel this way for you
CHORUS:
Well, I surrender—all my love
Surrender
Baby, I surrender—all my love to you
Such a strong desire
Has taken over me
Night and day, you’re all I live and breathe
So, baby, think about it
You’ve got to let me know
Tonight’s the night to let your feelings show
Oh, please don’t hold back
I’ve got to know that
You—could feel the same for me
CHORUS:
Will you surrender all your love
Surrender
Baby, please surrender—all your love to me
‘Cause I surrender—all my love
Surrender
Baby, I surrender—all my love to you...all my love
