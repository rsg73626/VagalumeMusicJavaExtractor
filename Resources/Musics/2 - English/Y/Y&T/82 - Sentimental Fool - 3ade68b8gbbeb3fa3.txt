SENTIMENTAL FOOL

I’ve seen this movie once before
Story of another broken heart
Can’t play the same old part again
I’m left empty
Looks like we nearly reached the end
CHORUS:
Sentimental fool
You know you didn’t do me right
Sentimental fool
Now you’ve got to pay the price
How did you think that we could last?
With expectations of an old romance?
You had to risk our love on sentiments
But this time don’t come running back to me
You’ll be a memory
CHORUS
Sentimental fool
You know you didn’t do me right
Sentimental fool
Was it worth the sacrifice?
Sentimental fool
Now you’ve got to pay the price
Sentimental fool
Can’t play that same old part again
