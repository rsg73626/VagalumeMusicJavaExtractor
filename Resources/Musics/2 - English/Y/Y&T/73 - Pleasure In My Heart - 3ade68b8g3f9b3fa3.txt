PLEASURE IN MY HEART

Look here pretty baby
At what you've done to me
My ways have all been changed
I can hardly even eat
My mind has gone through changes
That I don't understand
My love for you grows on
I'm just meltin' in your hands
I'm always thinking of you, babe
I do it all day long
You're everything I was wishing for
And I hope you never go
My nights I'll give you always
My days I'll also give you
Your the lady who's right for me
And I'll swear I'll be good to you
CHORUS:
Pleasure in my heart
whenever I'm with you
Always on my mind
I'm always needing you
Look here pretty baby
At what you've done to me
My ways have all been changed
I can hardly even eat
CHORUS:
Pleasure in my heart
whenever I'm with you
Always on my mind
I'm always needing you
