RHYTIM OR NOT

You tear it up
From one to four
That back beat rhythm’s gonna knock down
that door
Double time with a side step stride
You got everyone fall’n one beat behind
Rim shot rock
She’s got it
Hey man, look at those timbales
Rim shot rock
She’s got it
She’s got that swing that puts
Sex on the brain
CHORUS:
Rhythm or not
Here she comes again
Rhythm or not
Here she comes again
Bang that drum and ring that bell
Throw all my money down the wishin’ well
Big bang boom with stiletto shoes
She’s got me singin’ those “Please baby,
give me some” blues
Rim shot rock
She’s got it
Hey baby, do fries come with that shake
Rim shot rock
She’s got it
She’s got that swing that puts
Sex on the brain
CHORUS
Ooh, ooh, let me in
That rhythm drives me insane
Ooh, ooh, let me in
She’s got that swing that puts
Sex on the brain
CHORUS
