YOUR MAMA DON'T DANCE

mama don’t dance and your daddy don’t rock and roll
Your mama don’t dance and your daddy don’t rock and roll
When evenin’ rolls around and it’s time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll?
The old folks say that ya gotta end your date by ten
Well, if you’re out on a date and you bring her home late, it’s a sin
There just ain’t no excuse and you know you’re gonna lose and never win
Just say it again
And it’s all because your mama don’t dance and your daddy don’t rock and roll
Your mama don’t dance and your daddy don’t rock and roll
When evenin’ rolls around and it’s time to go to town
Where do you go, to rock and roll?
You pull into a drive-in, you find a place to park
You hop into the backseat where you know it’s nice and dark
You’re just about to move in, you’re thinking it’s a breeze
There’s a light in your eye, and then a guy says
Out of the car long hair
Oohhwww, you’re coming with me—the local police
And it’s all because your mama don’t dance and your daddy don’t rock and roll
Your mama don’t dance and your daddy don’t rock and roll
When evenin’ rolls around, and it’s time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll?
Where do you go to rock and roll?
Where do you go to rock and roll?
CHORUS(REPEAT)
