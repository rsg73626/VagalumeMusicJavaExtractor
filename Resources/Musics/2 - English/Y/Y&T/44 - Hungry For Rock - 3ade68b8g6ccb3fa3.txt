HUNGRY FOR ROCK

Monday morning’s coming on too fast
Weekend’s gone
Oh, how I need it would last
Punchin’ in, I feel like punchin’ ‘em out
It makes me scream, it makes me wanna get up and shout
They push and shove me all day
CHORUS:
Well I’m hungry for rock
Ready to roll
Yes, I’m hungry for rock
I’m gonna roll all over you
Coming home, it starts on me again
A battle zone in a war I just can’t win
Seems like I never win
You turn me on, so I turn it up
It sounds so good, baby, just can’t get enough
I can almost taste it
CHORUS
