THE KIDS GOES CRAZY

Two blondes in a T-Bird
Down on Sunset Boulevard
Oh, Hollywood you’re lookin’ good!
Lights, camera, action
Yeah, I’m gonna be a star
Just like I knew I always would
My hair is long
I got my red Reebocks on
Oh yeah, I’m lookin’ pretty cool
CHORUS:
The kid goes crazy
The kid goes crazy
The kid goes crazy
The kid goes wild—in Hollywood
The kid goes crazy
The kid goes crazy
Every time you hear that music
Look out, man, I’m talkin’ ‘bout the kid
Sittin’ in the movies
How I love the silver screen
‘Specially when the star is me
Photographs and autographs
They all want a piece of me
In Hollywood
I’m the king
