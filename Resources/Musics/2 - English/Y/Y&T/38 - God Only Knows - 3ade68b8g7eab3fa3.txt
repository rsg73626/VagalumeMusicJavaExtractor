GOD ONLY KNOWS

Eyes that look out across the sky
Eyes that look & wonder why
Hearts of hope, hearts that fly
Heart of pain, and these eyes that cry
God only knows us all
God only sees, what’s going on
God only knows
Beyond the dream, beyond the pain
Life goes on & we start again
There’s so much that I don’t know about
There’s so much, but it all works out
God only knows us all
God only sees, what’s going on
God only knows
Are we just a freak show in a big fishbowl
Going round & round
Spinning on a stone, in a twighlight zone
Are we really all alone?
Lay my head down, turn out the light
As I pray it all will be all right
Silently I close my eyes
As I whisper to the world, goodnight
God only knows
