COME IN FROM THE RAIN

Lonely—no one searchin’ for you
So lost now—deep inside your mind
And you feel like—there’s no one there to find you
Oh, what’cha gonna do if your whole world’s dying—whoa
Where ya gonna run if you’re inside hiding—whoa, whoa
You gotta let go
Feel the thunder—see the light
You’ve got the power—just start to fight
CHORUS:
Let it all come down
All the tears and pain
Open up—come in
From the rain—from the rain—from the rain—from the rain
Your eyes—long to tell the story
Of the secrets—wrapped in your disguise
Ooh, and it’s so hard—to reach out from inside you
But what’cha gonna do if you don’t start trying—whoa, whoa
How ya gonna live, when you feel like dying—whoa, whoa
You gotta let go
Of the thunder—and the light
You’ve got the power—stand up and fight
CHORUS:
Let it all come down
All the tears and pain
Open up—come in
From the rain
When it all comes down
Throw your fears away
Open up—open up
There’s another life inside you
Can’t you hear it call your name
