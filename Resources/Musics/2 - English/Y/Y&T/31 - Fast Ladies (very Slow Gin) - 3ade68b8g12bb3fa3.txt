FAST LADIES (VERY SLOW GIN)

People always tellin' me
I'm livin' too fast
They say "keep it up
And your body won't last‚Äù
But the fast life's the one I got to lead
'Cause if I can't, baby
I don't wanta be me
For me it's fast ladies
And very slow gin
I'm glad I'm still young
And my life's just beginning
Wake up in the daytime
The afternoon
Then I get ready to have my fun
I'm a wild, crazy person
And that's for sure
I'll be getting home early
Anytime around four
