KNOCK YOU OUT

Up against the ropes
I’ve been there before
I’ve been hit by the best, but never hit the floor
Toe-to-toe you know you should’ve thought twice
’Cause I’ve got what it takes
If you wanna stand up and fight

CHORUS:
I’m gonna knock you out
Already picked the round
When you step in my ring
You know you’re standing on my ground
I’m gonna knock you out
Ain’t gonna hold back
Upper cut, left, right, yeah
Gonna knock you out tonight

Got power, feel what I’ve done
I’ve seen a lot like you
On the way to number one
Don’t expect me to turn the other cheek
Get in my way and you will hear me speak

CHORUS
