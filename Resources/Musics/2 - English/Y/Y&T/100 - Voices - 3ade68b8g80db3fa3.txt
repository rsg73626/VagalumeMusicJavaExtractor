VOICES

Don’t talk to me, leave me alone
Inside my mind’s a battle zone
There’s a war that rages in my head
And I can’t hear a word you said
All these voices - scream in my head
Voices - from all the things that you’ve said
Seven sins, the voices scream
And seven times I walked away
Wishing that they’d set me free
All the demons that I can’t escape
All these voices - scream in my head
Voices - all the things that you’ve said
