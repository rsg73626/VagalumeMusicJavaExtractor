LUCY

Everybody’s talkin’ ‘bout Lucy
The hot little tramp with the suede blue eyes
One false move, get the bad reputation
Now the talk is cheap and the rumors fly
She’s got the fellas singin’: whoa
She’s got the girls a screamin’
CHORUS:
Now, everybody’s talkin’ ‘bout Lucy
Everybody’s talking ‘bout
Everybody’s sayin’ they know
Everybody’s talking ‘bout
Everybody’s talkin’ ‘bout Lucy
Everybody’s talking ‘bout
She ain’t got no other guy
Ooh, now, baby gonna be all mine
So tell me, baby, who you gonna run to
Shotgun turn and run, makin’ you cry
When everybody says that you’re going down
The word is out but I know it’s a lie
Stole my heart, now what’s the ransom
What’s it gonna take to make you mine, all mine
I’ll be the one to get you through the night
I’ll be your lover, be your alibi
She’s got the fellas singin’: whoa
She’s got the girls a screamin’
Now everybody's talkin’
But I’m the only one who knows
CHORUS
