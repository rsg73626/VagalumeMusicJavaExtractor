STRUCK DOWN

Well I've been struck down
By you baby
Tortured too
I've been put down
Made me crazy
Made a fool
CHORUS:
Well I ain't foolish
You better go away with your tricks
Struck Down!!
I can't take this
You know I can't take it
No more, no more
Well I said goodbye for the last time
Leave me alone
Pack up, pack up baby
Away from my home
CHORUS:
Well I ain't foolish
You better go away with your tricks
Struck Down!!
I can't take this
You know I can't take it
No more
No more
No more
No more
