LIPSTICK AND LEATHER

I've been kicked
I've been hit
I've been scratched
I've been bit
I've been pushed around
Shoved around
Had it rough
But it ain't enough
'Cause I never knew an angel could be so wild
I never felt love 'till I tried your style

Lipstick and Leather
Black and red, oh yeah!
Lipstick and Leather
Rock and roll baby made a mess of my head

I've been slapped
I've been blamed
I've been attacked
And I've been chained
Yeah you put me down
Slapped me round
Long enough
But love is tough

'Cause you're ready, willing, able to please
Somebody tell me why I'm down on my knees, I said
This must be love or I'm goin' insane
There's such a thin, thin line between pleasure and pain

Lipstick and Leather
Black and red, oh yeah!
Lipstick and Leather
Black and red...

The girl gets around
Red lips like a traffic light
But when the girl gets down
Leather love's gonna burn all night

Black and red, oh yeah!
Lipstick and Leather
Black and red
I've been kicked (lipstick and leather)
I've been hit
I've been scratched
and I've been bit
You can knock me down (lipstick and leather)
I'm gonna get back up
Yeah I've had it all
But it ain't enough
I've been scratched (lipstick and leather)
I've been attacked and chained
Driven down on my knees
And I'm goin' insane over

Lipstick and Leather (lipstick and leather)
Black and red
'Cause that rock and roll baby made a mess of my head
With your..

Lipstick and Leather (lipstick and leather)
Black and red, oh yeah!
Lipstick and Leather
Black and red, Oh!
