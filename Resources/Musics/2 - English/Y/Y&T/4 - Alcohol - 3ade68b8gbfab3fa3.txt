ALCOHOL

I went to a party just the other night
Well, everyone was there, it was out of sight
But after a while things got crazy
A fight was startin’ over someone’s old lady
Bottles were breakin’ and the windows too
All because someone drank too much brew
CHORUS:
Alcohol, alcohol
Tomorrow mornin' I'll be climbing the walls
Alcohol, alcohol
What I did tonight I don't want to recall
Well, you fight and you move and you get all
loose
When you got a bottle of that crazy juice
Fight and shout and cause a brawl
When you're out drinkin' that alcohol
I know it's true, I just wanta tell you all
The meanest trip is alcohol
CHORUS:
Alcohol, alcohol
Tomorrow mornin' I'll be sick as a dog
Alcohol, alcohol
Don't you know I don't dig it at all
Well, after the party I was drivin' home
Who did I see on the side of the road
Daniel P. in a V8 Ford
Spread-eagle on a police car door
The cop held a bottle in one of his hands
He said "Lookie here, Danny Boy, it's the
law of the land"
CHORUS:
Alcohol, alcohol
Alright now Danny Boy, we're goin'
Downtown to City Hall
Alcohol, alcohol
Danny's sleepin' down at the city hall
I finally got home, I was goin' to bed
I remembered a bottle of Tequila I had hid
I undid the cap, I started to drink
My head got fuzzy, I couldn't think
I laid down, my bed took to shakin'
The walls were green, my gut was achin'
CHORUS:
Alcohol, alcohol
Tomorrow mornin' I'll be climbin' the walls
Because of alcohol, alcohol
Oh, Dear Lord, I don't dig it at all
Alcohol, alcohol
Please help me out, Lord
Please, I can't stand it no more
Alcohol, alcohol
Tomorrow mornin' I'll be sick as a dog
Alcohol, alcohol
This hangover’s got me by the...
By the
Alcohol, alcohol
Tomorrow mornin' I'll be sick as a dog
On that
Alcohol, alcohol
If we keep on drinkin' it's gonna kill us all
Alcohol, alcohol
Tomorrow mornin’ I'll be climbin' the walls
