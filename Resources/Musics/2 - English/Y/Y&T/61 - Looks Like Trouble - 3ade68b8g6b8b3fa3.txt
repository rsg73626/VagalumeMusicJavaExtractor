LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE

Sittin’ here waitin’ for the next sucker punch
I gave her my Ferrari, I got no response
A woman with a brain can be a dangerous thing
Spin you like a top, like a puppet on a string
I can’t help myself
I’m just a toy on her shelf
I’m just a fool in love
I don’t know when to give up
CHORUS:
Well, it looks like trouble
It looks like trouble again
Ooh, it looks like trouble
It sure looks like trouble again
I gave you diamonds, you gave me disease
I gave you flowers, on bended knees
I write those love songs ‘specially for you
And all I get from you is lovesick blues
When I’ve had enough
You start that sexy stuff
Girl, you call my bluff
How can I just walk away?
CHORUS (REPEAT)
