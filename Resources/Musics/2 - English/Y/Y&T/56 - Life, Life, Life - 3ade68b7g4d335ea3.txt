LIFE, LIFE, LIFE

It's a bloody scene
Hear the population scream
As the missile rushes in
Can't you feel the flames of hell?
Can't you hear the tollin' bell?
It's the sound of the world coming to an end
Is it too late? Too late?
To make to make the politicians bend
We let the insane play their fools game
They're runnin' a race for death

We want,
Life, Life, Life
You'd better pull your head out of the sand
If you want
Life, Life, Life
It's time to break down the chain of command

When will they be satisfied?
After everybody's died?
That's the way it seems to be
Not only the USA
Everybody's to blame
We gotta stop the war machine

Is it too late? Too late?
To stop their evil master plan
It's a fools game and a mistake
When they laugh in the face of death

We want,
Life, Life, Life
You'd better pull your head out of the sand
If you want
Life, Life, Life
It's time to break down the chain of command

Solo: Dave Meniketti

We want life Solo: Dave Meniketti

That's right We want,
Life, Life, Life
You'd better pull your head out of the sand
If you want
Life, Life, Life
It's time to break down the chain of command

We want,
Life, Life, Life
You'd better join up with the living
It's time to make a stand for
Life, Life, Life
It's time to break down the chain of command

Is it too late? Too late? .....

Too late?
Too late?
Too late?
Too late?
Too late?
