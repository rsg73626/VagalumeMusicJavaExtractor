GIMME THE BEAT

Gimme The Beat

(D. Meniketti, P. Kennemore)
ã 1997 Meanstreak Music (BMI)

The beat goes on, pounding out it’s changes
Sometimes I lose the rhythm ‘long the way
It’s up-side down, it’s all so syncopated
Ahead, behind, the rhythm in my head
Well I know that time just keeps banging away
And I know that I’ll find my way
Just gimme the beat
Point me in the right direction
Gimme the beat
And I’ll be on my way
Gimme the beat
‘Till I make my connection
And I know that I’ll find my way
Step by step, I’m rolling with these changes
I’m back in time, it’s all so clear to me
It feels so right, so uncomplicated
No time to think about what might have been
Well I know that time just keeps banging away
Count it down, I’m on my way
Just gimme the beat
Point me in the right direction
Gimme the beat
And I’ll be on my way
Gimme the beat
‘Till I make my connection
And I know that I’ll find my way
