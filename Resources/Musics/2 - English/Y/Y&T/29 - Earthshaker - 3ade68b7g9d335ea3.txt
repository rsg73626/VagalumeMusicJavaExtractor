EARTHSHAKER

Come on baby, what you goin' thru?
You know my eyes won't get off you, baby.
You know what I'm thinkin', baby gonna take you home.
You don't come now, I'll be all alone.
Well, I'm a mean Earth Shaker, baby
I'm a cold, cold heartbreaker, yeah.

Lets go, baby, we're gonna get on down 
Well, you fool with me tonight, I won't be
your clown.
You filled my dreams just for tonight, 
If you don't hand 'round no more, it'll be alright

Well, I'm a mean Earth Shaker, baby 
I'm a cold, cold heartbreaker, yeah.
