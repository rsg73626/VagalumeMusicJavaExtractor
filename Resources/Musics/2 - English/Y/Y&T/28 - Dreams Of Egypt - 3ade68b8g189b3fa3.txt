DREAMS OF EGYPT

Come my friend
Give me a hand
Come along with me
To this foreign land
We'll go together
Cross the desert sand
To the place of the sphinx
And the Egyptian man
Dancing girls
All around my feet
What a better way
To beat the heat
Exotic music
Rings out like a bell
Hypnotic rhythm
Puts me in a spell
Come my friend
Give me a hand
Come along with me
To this foreign land
We'll go together
Cross the desert sand
To the place of the sphinx
And the Egyptian man
