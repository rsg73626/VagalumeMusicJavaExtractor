CAN'T STOP THE RAIN

Well it rained all night, washed my world away
Storm I couldn’t ride, mudslide of pain
Till I got my back
Against the wall, I . . .
Can’t stop the rain
No, no, no
Can’t stop the rain
Dreaming of the sun, oh yesterday, summer day
Ain’t it funny how, the weather can change
No shelter from the storm
Black waters high
Can’t stop the rain
No, no, no
Can’t stop the rain
Don’t know how it feels
At the top of the hill
Your whole world comes tumbling down
All your luck, it has changed
All your dreams down the drain
The water just keeps coming down
I know the sun, will shine someday
Until that time, here I’ll stay
No shelter from the storm
Black waters high
