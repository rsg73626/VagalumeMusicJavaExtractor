Well you took me and you loved me
Like I never been loved before
You took me and squeezed me
Like I never been squeezed before
Now I come around your house
Just asking for a little more
I searched a million miles for you, girl
You're always on my mind
Searched high and low, girl
You're just one of a kind
Now all I wannta do
is take you home to be all mine
I want you to be mine
I need you more every day
I want your lovin', baby
What more can I say
I wish I had you all the time
Twenty-five hours a day
Twenty-Five hours
Twenty-Five hours a day
Twenty-Five hours
Twenty-Five hours a day
Twenty-Five hours
Twenty-Five hours a day
Twenty-Five hours
Twenty-Five hours a day
I wish I had you all the time
Twenty-five hours a day
I wish I had you all the time
Twenty-Five hours a day
