I'M LOST

You got me spinnin'
Round an round
I can't see the sky from here
Everything I feel
Drives me down
Too far
Too far, and now I fear
CHORUS:
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost
All your words burn
Through my mind
It seems so hard to break away
Alone I run
Afraid I find
All walls around, nowhere to stay
CHORUS
