DIRT GIRL

I get a one-track mind
When I see you from behind
Black stockings and those sexy legs
It's drivin’ me wild
Body heat gives me a thrill
Got a look that says you will
Turn around, let me check it out
Give me a sign
CHORUS:
Dirty girl
Hot on your tail
Ooh, girl you wear me out
Dirty girl
Ooh, what you got
If you give it, I can take it all night
Oh baby, I like the way you move
Let me lay you down in the groove
Heat me up with your bowl of fire
So easy to please
You got my knees a shakin’
You got my seams a breakin’
Don't go and let me down
I got what you need
CHORUS (REPEAT)
