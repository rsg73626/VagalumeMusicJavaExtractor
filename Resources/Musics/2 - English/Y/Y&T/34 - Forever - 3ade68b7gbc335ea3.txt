FOREVER

I surrender all my love
And you, you make my desire run
Hot (hot) Hot as the desert sands
Your eyes have power to hold me
like no others can
Fallin' I keep on fallin'
So much deeper, so much deeper for you
Forever, forever, forever
Fallin' for you

High, we're flying so high tonight
Touch (touch), your touch makes the passion rise
Strong (strong, hot), strong as the mighty seas
I need search no more
You're the end of rainbow for me

Fallin' I keep on fallin'
So much deeper, so much deeper for you
Forever, forever, forever
Fallin' for you

Solo: Dave Meniketti

So come, come take my hand
And we'll ride the winds of heaven
Like only we can
Forever, forever, forever, fallin' for you
Forever, forever, forever, fallin' for you

Forever
Fallin', fallin', fallin'
forever
I'll keep on fallin' so deeply
forever
I guess I'm fallin' for you

I surrender all to you
I surrender all my love
I surrender all to you

Forever
