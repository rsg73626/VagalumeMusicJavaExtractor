NOWHERE LAND

Nowhere Land

(P. Kennemore)
1995 Meanstreak Music (BMI)

Spent the last year staring at the sea
Message in a bottle, kept coming back to me
Picked it up and threw it hard
Landed in my neighbors yard
Life is but a dream
I'm just waiting here in nowhere land
Waiting for someone to be
Counting pictures on my wall
Waiting for my curtain call
Somewhere is waiting for me
Oh my darling, catch me if I fall
Here in nowhere land
Finding faces in the clouds
Abraham where are you now?
Blowing smoke rings through the sky so high
Picture perfect, pornographic
Mona Lisa in the rain
Pressure cook me, try to hook me
I keep looking to the sea - 'cause
I'm just waiting here in nowhere land
Waiting for someone to be
Oh my darling, catch me if I fall
The thought police have come to get you
You're under arrest for killing time
What's your use and what's your purpose
Put your hands up boy, or lose your mind
Oh my darling, catch me if I fall
Here in nowhere land
Angels hang on stucco walls
Gloden frames and velvet halls
Blowing smoke rings to the sky, so high
Lizards on my window pane
Sit and watch the ant parade
What the hell they do all day
I'm just waiting, here in nowhere land
