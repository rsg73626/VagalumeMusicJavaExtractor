NASTY SADIE

I'm gonna tell you 'bout a girl I know
They call her Nasty Sadie, she's at all the shows
She comes 'round pretty all dressed up and sweet
She's not the kind of girl you'd have your mama meet
CHORUS:
Nasty Sadie
Your a real fine lady
How you drive me crazy
Take me home, Nasty Sadie
She feels so good with perfume so sweet
And looks even sweeter from her head to her feet
She'll come up, flirt, and get you all alone
And start doin' things that you never known
CHORUS
After the show driving in my car
Goin' over Sadie's to get a bit bizarre
We'll have a shady time that you can bet
One of those nights, baby, I will never forget
CHORUS
