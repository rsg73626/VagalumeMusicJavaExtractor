QUICKSAND

Oh, I'm sinking
Screaming for someone to throw me a line
No one hears me
My life passes right before my eyes
The sun is shining
Yet I'm dying
The vultures circling round
What was I thinking
As I'm sinking
Standing in quicksand
No one told me
Never to walk down this road alone
Now I'm humbled
Could they find me, would they ever know
I'm going under
Called my number
Before my time
What was I thinking
As I'm sinking
Standing in quicksand
Am I dreaming
Wake me up before I'm too far gone
Is it slumber
Pulling me under
Pulling me down
What was I thinking
As I'm sinking
Standing in quicksand
