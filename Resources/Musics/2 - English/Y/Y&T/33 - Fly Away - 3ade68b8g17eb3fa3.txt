FLY AWAY

I see rainbow colored dreams
Skies of blue on the sea of green
Little funky shack, I wont be turning back
Tonight I'm gonna fly away, and there won't be no tracks
Like a rainbow shooting down
Like an upside frown
I see smoke rings through the trees
I'm gonna up and disappear into the midnight breeze
Hey, let's fly away
Up to the stars, way up in the sky
Fly, fly away
On my magic carpet ride
Night comes, and the wind calls your name
Oh, sweet Jasmine blows to my face
Oh, your majesty
Fly into your dreams
Tonight I'll set you free
Coming right through your window, gonna take you away with me
Hey, let's fly away
Above the clouds and way up in the sky
Fly, fly away
On my magic carpet ride
Starlight, star so bright
First star that I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Be the one to hold you tight
Like a rainbow shooting down
Like an upside frown
I see smoke rings through the trees
I'm gonna up and disappear into the midnight breeze
Hey, let's fly away
Above the clouds and way up in the sky
Fly, fly away
On my magic carpet ride
