SAIL ONE BY

Been so long since I’ve seen you smile
I know what you’re going through
Yesterday, seems you had it all
Now it all just fades from view
You want to keep holding on
But it’s time for letting go
Time to be moving on
Time to let it be
Sail on by
Sail on by the sorrow
Sail on by
The sun is gonna shine, just let it be
Sweet memories of yesterday
It’s so hard to walk away
Heart & soul, you gave it all
Now it just don’t mean a thing
Tonight, all the tears you cry
Time for letting go
Tomorrow the sun will rise
Let it shine on you
Sail on by
Sail on by the sorrow
Sail on by
The sun is gonna shine, just let it be
