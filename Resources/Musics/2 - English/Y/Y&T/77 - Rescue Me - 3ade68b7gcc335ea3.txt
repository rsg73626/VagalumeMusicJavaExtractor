RESCUE ME

I was down, I was barely makin' it
she was gone and I couldn't take it
I was looking for a new way of thinkin'
When I go to sleep, I pray I wouldn't wake up
Well, I want you, I want you to
Rescue Me

The wheel kept turning
But I stood still
As the shadow looking for the man
Did I play to win,
or did i win to loose
of all the cards i had to draw the fool...

all people tellin' me
about things i do
the more i hear
the less i see the truth
Oh, well I'm on the edge
I can't look down
Oh, slippin', slippin', slippin' Oh...Help!

I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me Oh you know I want you
I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me

A voice faintly callin'
from another time
Oh so strange,
it sounds like mine
Shades of black
and a twisted road
and I can't see the sky from here

Oh, do I turn around?
I go straight ahead
I can't stop now
I find the light somewhere
Oh, well I'm on the edge I can't look down
Oh, slippin', slippin', slippin' Oh...Help!

I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me Oh you know I want you
I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me

Solo: Dave Meniketti I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me Oh you know I want you
I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me

Oh you know I want you
I want you to Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me
Oh, Rescue Me
