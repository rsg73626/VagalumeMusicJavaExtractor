FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE

You’re mak’n plans you’ll never keep
The cocaine flows and the talk is cheap
Started out a friendly game
First the pleasure, then the pain
Dream a million dreams of gold
You tell yourself that you’re in control
It goes on and on but the truth remains
It goes on and on
No, you just can’t walk away
Break the chains
CHORUS:
Are you willing to fight?
Fight for your life
Fight for your life
Are you ready to fight?
Fight for your life
Fight for your life
The endless lies and the sleepless nights
All the friends that said goodbye
One by one
You see ‘em walk away
One by one
Right now you gotta make the change
Walk away
CHORUS
Promises you’ll never keep
The cocaine flows, the talk is cheap
It goes on and on
But the truth remains
It goes on and on
No, you just can’t walk away
Break the chains
CHORUS
