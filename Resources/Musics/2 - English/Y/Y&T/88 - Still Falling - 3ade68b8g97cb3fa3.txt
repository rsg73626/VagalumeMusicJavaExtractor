STILL FALLING

Here - right here where I belong
Holding on to you, is all I want to do
Baby - now it’s been so long
Since I fell for you, you’re all I wanna do, oh baby
Shared the dream, shared the pain
You’ve seen the worst of me
But darling, still you stayed
You’re my light, you’re my key
You’re my will, you’re my desire
You’re my reason to believe
Cause when the world turns away
I could always run to you
You’re my soul, my destiny
And after all this time, oh you know that I’m
Still fallin’, still fallin’
Darlin’ can’t you see, what you mean to me
Still fallin’
In my life, I never knew
I could find someone who loves me
Loves me like you do
So hold me close & don’t let go
Our love will be our strength
Our love will see us through
And as I’m lying here with you
I can feel the magic of your touch
And when I look in to your eyes
It’s deeper than before
Oh you know that I’m
Still Fallin’, Still Fallin’
Darlin can’t you see, what you mean to me
Still Fallin’, Still Fallin’
After all this time, oh you know that I’m
Still Fallin’
