I WANNA CRY

I got something burning deep inside
Listen to me, I can make it right
Every time I see you, I . . .
Wanna take you down & come inside
I want you - so bad
Want you right now, so bad
So bad I wanna cry - I wanna cry
I’m the one, the one who wants you now
I’m gonna be the man that you will live for
I got a feeling that you’ll be comin round
I can make it so sweet, somehow
I want you - so bad
Want you right now, so bad
So bad I wanna cry - I wanna cry
I’m the eyes that watch you in the night
I’m the lips that taste you - all right
You’re destiny out in the dark
Until I get to you, sleep tight
I want you - so bad
Want you right now, I’m going mad
I want you - so bad
I want you right now - right now
So bad I wanna cry - I wanna cry
