TEN LOVERS

Ooh baby ya keep on runnin’
Through my mind now, and ya just won’t
stop
Ooh baby is your heart burning
Like the flame that’s burning in my heart
Don’t know what it’s all about
All I know is that ya knockin’ me out
Don’t know why I keep on tryin’
Hey baby, all the time
Ya give me all your sweet, sweet lovin’
Oh little girl now ya don’t come ‘round no
more
Ya keep on runnin’, hidin’ honey
Leavin’ me just a hanging ‘round your door
Baby, baby, where ya been
You know my world is turnin’
All around your little playful heart
You know I keep the candle burning
You knew you had me from the very start
So little lover, why you walk on by
Little lover, why ya make me cry
No need for alibis
Oh baby give me one more try
The rain beats on my window pane
The autumn leaves have turned to gold
Lonely are the nights without you
The fire’s flame it burns so low
CHORUS:
Ten lovers couldn’t make me crazy
Oh girl I’m needin’ you tonight
Ten lovers couldn’t make me crazy
Turnin’ off and on the lights
Ten lovers like the night before
Ten lovers at my open door
Ten lovers couldn’t take the place
Every day I need your heart’s embrace
No song, no faith, no reason
Would ever steal my heart away
No baby, I’ll keep believin’
Some day you’re coming back to stay
So little lover, why ya walk on by
Little lover, why ya make me cry
No need for alibis
Oh baby give me one more try
The rain beats on my window pane
The autumn leaves have turned to gold
CHORUS
So, little lover, why ya walk on by
Little lover, why ya make me cry
No need for alibis
Come on baby, give me one more
CHORUS
