OPEN FIRE

So far somehow I've managed to keep control
It's time to get them balls free to roll
I save it all up for the right time to let it go, go, go
Fair warning be ready
I'm gonna explode
All week long getting primed up for what we do
and when I get it up
Gonna spend some time with you
Have me some fun
Gonna shoot my guns in the sky
Now you know but oh, it's easy to fly
I'm flying high

Open Fire when I hit the stage
Gonna Open Fire
All over this place
Open Fire
In a rockin' rage
I'm gonna Open Fire

When the lights go down
You know I'm gonna tear it up
Get real gnarly
We're all gonna strut our stuff
Like a short fuse on a stick of dynamite
Full blast - now we're gonna ignite
Blow up the night, Do it right
I'm gonna ignite

Open Fire when I hit the stage
Gonna Open Fire
All over this place
Open Fire
In a rockin' rage
I'm gonna Open Fire

Set me free
Light my fuse
Gonna blow up the night
Yeeaaah!

So far somehow I've managed to keep control
It's time to get them balls free to roll
I save it all up for the right time to let it go, go, go
Fair warning be ready
I'm gonna explode
You better light my fuse
Get ready
I'm gonna explode

Open Fire when I hit the stage
Gonna Open Fire
All over this place
Open Fire
In a rockin' rage
I'm gonna Open Fire

Wow, set me free right now
Light my fuse
Gonna blow up the night
