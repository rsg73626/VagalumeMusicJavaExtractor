EYES OF A STRANGER

I’ve been wait’n girl to get you alone
And slip into your sexual zone
For so long we’ve been only friends
For so long had to just pretend
But, this is the time
This is the place
This could be our magic moment
So give me your love
Give me your touch
And look in the eyes of a stranger
CHORUS:
In the eyes
Eyes of a stranger
In the eyes
Eyes of a stranger
Your body’s so hot in my hands
Gonna do it to ya—slide it in
I’ll show you every inch I’m a man
Then I’ll get it up and do it again
This is the time
This is the place
This is what dreams should be made of
So give me your love
Give me your touch
And look in the eyes of a stranger
CHORUS
