ALL AMERICAN BOY

I got a ‘57 Chevy with four on the floor
Glass packs, cheeter slicks, 454
Girls on the phone, girls at my door
They just keep comin’ back for more
CHORUS:
I’m just a red-blooded, fun-lovin’ all American boy
I’m just a red-blooded, fun-lovin’ all American boy
Got a pink Stratocaster and my band is hot
Wild streak a mile wild that just won’t stop
Got a chain on my mirror made of beer can tops
A chip on my shoulder, better not knock it off
CHORUS
Well her eyes are blue and her skin is tan
The girl next to me, thinks that I’m all hands
And I’m gonna touch her everywhere I can
CHORUS
