MIDNIGHT IN TOKYO

From afar I have come
'Cause you called to me
A guitar was the sound that you heard
Like a song on a wave
From across the sea
Like a vaguely familiar word
The ring of fire won't discourage me
Though the earth moved under my feet
the day that we touched
And now - I'm here with you
But now - I'm wanting to
Get back to my home and the ones
I miss so much

Midnight, midnight in Tokyo
Where the neon lights the land of the rising sun
Midnight, oh midnight I must go
But one day I will return if you'll only wait for me

ln each place I can feel the warmth of you
In your face I can see that you're strong
And respect is what I've learned from you
When I'm gone, it won't be for long

I ride the "Bullet" through the heart of you
Though the winds will blow
And the rain will fall when I'm gone
But now - I'm here with you
And now - I'm wanting to get back to my home
And the ones who miss me so much

Midnight, midnight in Tokyo
Where the neon lights the land of the rising sun
Midnight, oh midnight I must go
But one day I will return if you'll only wait for me

Midnight, Oh midnight in Tokyo
Where the neon lights the land of the rising sun
Midnight, oh midnight I must go
But one day I will return if you'll only wait
Only wait for... me
