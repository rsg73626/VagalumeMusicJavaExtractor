GAME PLAYING WOMAN

Sittin' alone here yeah, in this empty room
Needin' your love to feel good
But you're not with me, yeah, you've strayed away
I bet you'll be back some day
Game playin' woman, you're breakin' my heart
But I won't play your way
When you grow up, come back to me
We'll make it work some way
You made me love you
To make you feel good
You played your lovin' games with me
How I knew you would
