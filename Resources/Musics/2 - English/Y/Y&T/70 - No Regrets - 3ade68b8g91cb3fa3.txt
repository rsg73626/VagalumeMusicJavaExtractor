NO REGRETS

Wake me up, I've been gone too long
'Cause there's so much ahead of me
All my life, I've had pain and sorrow
And that's all I could ever see
I sat empty, wasting all my days
Waiting for a future dream
And now I see that there's so much more
When I forgive myself and just let it go
So here I stand
With my arms wide open
With no regrets at all
I've laid naked, with the past I've made
And there's no reason for me to bleed
"What-could-have-been", is a nowhere place
That clouds the view ahead of me
I made a sacrifice, to free my mind
I've shed my past, and put it all behind me
Now here I stand
With my whole life before me
And no regrets at all
All my life, I felt all alone - on my own
But my self-pity got the best of me
Now, I've learned my past, doesn't have to be - my enemy
And I'm the only one, who's in control - in control of my destiny
And now I see that there's so much more
When I forgive myself and just let it go
Now here I stand
With my arms wide open
With no regrets at all
