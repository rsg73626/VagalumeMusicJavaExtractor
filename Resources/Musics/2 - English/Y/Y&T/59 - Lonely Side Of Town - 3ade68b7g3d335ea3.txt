LONELY SIDE OF TOWN

It's a cold cold city
When you're out there on your own
What a shame and a pity
That no one wants to know
I see the people laugh and share
But for me there's no one there
This empty life just isn't fair
And the world don't see me here

I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town - right here
I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town

How did I fall so far? - oh so far
Tell me where did I go wrong
Did I stay away too long? - oh too long

With my old friends it's not the same
Seems we don't know what to say
I understand but still it's strange
when your friends just fade away

I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town - right here
I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town

Solo: Dave Meniketti

I see the people laugh and share
But for me there's no one there
This empty life just isn't fair
And the world don't see me here

I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town - right here
I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town - right here
I'm on the lonely
Lonely side of town - right here
I'm on the lonely
I'm on the lonely side of town
