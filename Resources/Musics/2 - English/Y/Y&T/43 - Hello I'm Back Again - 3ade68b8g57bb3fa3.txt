HELLO I'M BACK AGAIN

I’m back - and I’m here to stay
Just took a little holiday
I’m back - so spread the news
Got me a new attitude
Did you think that, that I would just fade away
I’m here now, I’m back now, right in your face
Hello, hello - I’m back again
Did you think that this would be the end
Hello, hello - I’m back again
Gonna take you higher than you’ve ever been
This time - gonna take control
Right now - gonna let it roll
This time - can ya see the light
Right now - gonna blow your mind
I’ll give you the power, dont turn away
I’ll take you ten thousand miles away
Hello, hello - I’m back again
Did you think that this would be the end
Hello, hello - I’m back again
Gonna take you higher than you’ve ever been
