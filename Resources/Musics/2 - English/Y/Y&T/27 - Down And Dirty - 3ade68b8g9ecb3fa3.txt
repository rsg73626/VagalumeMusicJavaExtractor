DOWN AND DIRTY

It’s a Friday night and you can feel the itch coming
You wanna blast out of hell
Like a throttle wide open on a 747
Drain every drop in the well
Don’t care about money
Don’t care what they say
Don’t care about nothing
I only just want to play, and
CHORUS:
Gettin’ down and dirty
You can feel it in the air
We’re getting down and dirty
Everybody’s gonna be there
I’m not talking about trouble
I’m talking about some energy
Think I’m gonna need a double
To keep up with the rest of me
All the girls walking by
Oh, they’re looking so fine
Even though they got their nose in the air
And I wanna be there
When the steam starts to rise
And you’re dripping wet
You don’t care
CHORUS
Don’t care about money
Don’t care what they say
Don’t care about nothing
I only just want to play, and
CHORUS
