COLD DAY IN HELL

She lays it down so sweet
Then she acts so tough
Down in between the sheets
She plays it touch by touch
She looks me in the eyes
Ready or not
She slides her body down
I'm praying she don't stop - She says
If you tell me that you love me
I'll do the snaky lick trick
It'll be a cold day, a cold day in hell
When I can walk away, girl, you know damn well
It'll be a cold day, a cold day in hell
You got me by the balls, girl, I'm under your spell
A cold day in hell
Dirty looks, dirty fingers
And a dirty little mind
She's holding back on me
Says tell me one more time
Slide it in, slide it out
She likes it doggy style
I like the view from here
Just like a sideways smile - She says
If you tell me that you love me
I'll take you all the way
It's gonna be a cold day, a cold day in hell
When I can walk away, girl, I'm under your spell
It'll be a cold day, a cold day in hell
Oh now you got me baby, and you know damn well
It'll be a cold day, a cold day in hell
You got me by the balls, girl, I'm under your spell
