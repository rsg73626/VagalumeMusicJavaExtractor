YOUNG AND TOUGH

Here she comes like a heart attack
The way she looks could kill ya, all dressed in black
With her lips on fire and her wild hair
She knows the boys are looking, but she don’t care
She’s way too smart for an empty line
Gotta let her know, she’s my kind
CHORUS:
She’s young
And tough
She got the moves, she’s got the stuff
She’s young
And tough
You better watch it
Some like to talk, some fantasize
They call her cheap and easy, but that’s a lie
She got class, got style
She got ‘em beat by a city mile
She’s way to fine for an empty line
Gotta let her know, she’s my kind
CHORUS
Here she comes like a heart attack
The way she looks could kill ya, all dressed in black
With her lips on fire and her wild hair
She knows the boys are looking, but she don’t care
She’s way too fine for an empty line
Gotta let her know, she’s my kind
