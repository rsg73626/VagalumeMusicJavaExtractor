CITY

Nine months on the road
Don’t know if it’s night or day
A little gypsy blood
Sure seems to go a long way
Time’s gettin’ tough
So, I’m getting tougher
Just let the music rock these blues away
Caught up in a jet stream
Another day here and gone
Acetylene, gasoline, Jimmy Beam
Keeps us movin’ on
Rockin’ and rollin’
All my sweat and blood
Backstage floozies, all lookin’ for love
CHORUS:
Take me to the city
Back home where I belong
Back to the city
Rock me all night long
Take me to the city
Back home where I belong
Hot town, big city
Rockin’ all night long
Knock, knock, knock
Knockin’ on the devil’s door
Get a little, give a lot
But you always gotta give more
One day you’re in, then
Next day you’re out
Livin’ on the edge is what it’s all about
CHORUS
