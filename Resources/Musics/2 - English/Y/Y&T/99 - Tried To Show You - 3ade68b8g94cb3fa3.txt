TRIED TO SHOW YOU

I've been trying for a long time
To make you understand
Your lack of faith in me
Almost ruined me as a man
You thought this goal in life
I could never fill
But you didn't see through
My power of will
CHORUS:
You couldn't see
When I told you
What's right for me
I tried to show you
I'm sure you couldn't know
The tough times that I had
I even lost my love
Almost drove me mad
But now this life I seek
Is coming true
These things I did myself
No help to you
CHORUS
I've been trying for a long time
To make you understand
Your lack of faith in me
Almost ruined me as a man
You thought this goal in life
I could never fill
But you didn't see through
My power of will
