SUMTHIN' 4 NUTH'N

Laying back, back the beat
Oh man, ‘cause I’m in so deep
Need some stress, stress relief
No time to be discreet
Just doing 8 hours of prison time
You want everything, you’ve got to do the time
Sometimes I feel I’ll lose my mind
I ain’t no fool, waiting for a sign
Sumthin 4 nuth’n
Is still nothing to me
Sumthin 4 nuth’n
Nothing comes that easily
Get rich, rich quick
Everybody chompin’ at the bit
Don’t bother looking there
Oh man, you better save your prayers
‘Cause your just going down a wrong-way track
You give it all & get nothing back
Sometimes I feel I’ll lose my mind
There’s nothing down that road to find
Sometimes I think I’ll lose my mind
But, I ain’t no fool, waiting for a sign
Sumthin 4 nuth’n
Is still nothing to me
Sumthin 4 nuth’n
Nothing comes that easily
