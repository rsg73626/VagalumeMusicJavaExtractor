BODILY HARM

Breaking the silence
Pounding hearts hear the beating drum
Losing my senses I’m mortally wounded
The hunter is on the run
Shots fired
Streaks through the dark
Dead in my tracks
They’ve hit their mark
CHORUS:
Bodily harm, destroying my defenses
Bodily harm, whoa
Bodily harm, I’ll have to take my chances
Bodily harm, whoa
She had the element of surprise
I’m overcome
My desire left a trail a mile wide
Her body the smoking gun
Love cuts
Sharp as a knife
Can’t feel the pain
When it’s done right
CHORUS
It’s no use running
There’s no escape
No use being afraid
