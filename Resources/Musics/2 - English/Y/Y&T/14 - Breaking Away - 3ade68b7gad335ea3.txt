BREAKING AWAY

A promise weakened by the hands of time
Honest, I meant it when I said be mine
Eternal love was a dream
l hoped we could share
I could be wrong
but it seems love that's strong just ain't there
I'm coming into myself
It may leave you far behind
I'm changing my world
Breaking Away
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart

Sorry - is something I don't want to say
Heartache - with no one to blame
Living a lie could be our mistake
I can't deny love's a feeling I just won't fake

I'm coming into myself
It may leave you far behind
I'm changing my world
Breaking Away
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Oh baby, yes..
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart

Baby - I never wanted to hurt you
I know you're confused
Well baby I am too
If the feeling we share could be less than true
Then let's not deny the love you and I had is through
I'm coming into myself
It may leave you far behind
I'm changing my world
Breaking Away
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Oh baby yeah..
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart
Oh, I'm sorry baby..
Breaking Away
and it's breaking your heart, yes
Breaking Away
