BEAUTIFUL DREAMER

You know I've always loved you
And my heart cries out to you
I love you in the mornin' when the sun comes over the hilltops
Yes I'll always love you
You mean everything in my life, oh yeah
You're the sugar in my coffee, yeah
You're the honey in my tea
I wake up every mornin’
You mean everything to me
Baby I'll always love you
You mean everything in my life, oh yeah
You're my beautiful dreamer, how I love you
You're my beautiful dreamer, how I miss you
You're my beautiful dreamer, how I love you
You're my beautiful dreamer, how I need you
I loved you ‘til my heart cried
When you left I nearly died
I can't be without you
So I sing these words to you
Baby I'll always love you
You mean everything in my life, oh yeah
