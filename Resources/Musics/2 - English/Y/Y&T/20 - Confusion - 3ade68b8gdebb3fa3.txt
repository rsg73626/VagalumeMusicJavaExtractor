CONFUSION

You can shave your head or raise the dead
It all comes down to you
Moralize and criticize
It's so easy to do
No solutions - No
Hey - your talking revolution
Tearing down the walls of the institutions
No solutions - No
So round & round & round we go
Were locked in this state
State of confusion
You call it revolution
Justify the sacrifice
Justify the pain
Victimize and glamorize
Your angry heart of hate
No solutions - No
So round & round & round we go
Were locked in this state
State of confusion
You call it revolution
