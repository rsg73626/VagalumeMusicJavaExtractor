ANYTIME AT ALL

Never been a mystery
Girl, you see, it’s you and me
Never had a single doubt
That it wasn’t right
Though most things, come and go
Ooh, so good to know
After all that’s said and done we’ll be
Side by side
I want you to know
You’ll always get the best of me
I want you to know
You can always count on me
CHORUS:
Anytime at all
You can call me, you can count on me
Anytime at all
You can call me, anytime
Heart jumps when I feel your touch
With you I never get enough
It’s so easy to fall in love with you
Night by night
Day to day, kiss to kiss
Ain’t it magic when I kiss your lips?
Girl, you’re still the one that keeps me
satisfied
I want you to know
You’ll always get the best of me
I want you to know
You can always count on me
CHORUS (REPEAT)
Love came alive
On the night we met
So electrifying
We ain’t stoppin’ yet
And when we’re apart
You’re always on my mind
I know I’m in your heart
Still together all the time
I want you to know
You’ll always get the best of me
I want you to know
You can always count on me
You can always lean on me
CHORUS
