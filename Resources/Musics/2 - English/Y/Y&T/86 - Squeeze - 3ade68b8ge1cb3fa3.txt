SQUEEZE

She’s a crazy lady
She don’t put up a fight
She keeps me rollin’ and a tumblin’
And she squeeze me tight
She knows every little trick in the dirty book
I don’t ever want to leave her
’Cause I love to please her
CHORUS:
Oh, feels so good
Squeeze
She’s an easy woman but she gets me hard
This honey pie can’t go too far
She keeps a humpin’ and a pumpin’ till I lose control
My little baby’s got so much soul
CHORUS
She’s a crazy lady
She don’t put up a fight
She keeps me rollin’ and a tumblin’
And she squeeze me tight
She knows every little trick in the dirty book
I don’t ever want to leave you
’Cause I love to please you
CHORUS
