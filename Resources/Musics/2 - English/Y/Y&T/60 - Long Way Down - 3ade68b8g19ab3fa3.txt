LONG WAY DOWN

I kindly decline your invitation
I think I'll just stay at home
Aint no part of no congregation
I'm doing fine out on my own
I'm free
Aint nothing about me set in stone
Oh I don't know - but
It's a long way down, and I don't want to go
It's a long way down, down to the fire below
My regards to the prince, and tell them all hello
'Cause it's a long way down, and I don't want to go
Sometimes I swear there aint no heaven
And I pray to God there aint no hell
So I pass on this temptation
Hoping that it serves me well
Sometimes
I wonder what's on the other side
Oh I don't know - but
It's a long way down, and I don't want to go
It's a long way down, down to the fire below
My regards to the prince, and tell them all hello
'Cause it's a long way down, and I don't want to go
