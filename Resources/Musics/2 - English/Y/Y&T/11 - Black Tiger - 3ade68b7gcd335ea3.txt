BLACK TIGER

O-Cat eyes, she draws you in
Hypnotized - she's under your skin
Beauty to see, but not to touch
In her play of passion
She plays to rough
Black tiger, ready to strike
Searching for a victim
In the heat of the night

Oo - cool and collected
She makes no mistakes
If you're in her territory
You know you're fair game
Scratch and claw all over your face
She's playing for keeps so low
You better get away

Black tiger, ready to strike
Searching for a victim
In the heat of the night
Black tiger don't turn your back
You never know when she will attack

Hold out, watch out
Just stay away
She's gonna hurt you
And leave you to waste
Watch out, jump back
Her teeth are sharp
If she gets too close
She's gonna make a mess of your heart

Black tiger, ready to strike
Searching for a victim
In the heat of the night
Black tiger don't turn your back
You never know when she will attack
