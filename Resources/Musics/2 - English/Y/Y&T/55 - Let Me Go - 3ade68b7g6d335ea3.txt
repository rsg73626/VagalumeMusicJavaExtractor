LET ME GO

Been so long since I've seen you smile,
the way you used to do.
Something's changed but it's hard to tell,
if it's me or if it's you.
Words come hard after all this time,
you see there's nothing left to say.
Let's face it baby, though we really tried,
You know we can't go on this way.
Let Me Go
Let Me Go
All I want from you, is just to 
Let Me Go


Once lovers now touch,
making love don't mean a thing.
Even close feels so far away,
only time will ease the pain.
Ain't no use in me hangin' on,
why don't you just let it be.
Hate to say it but there ain't no way,
but time for you to set me free..yes.

Let Me Go
Let Me Go
All I want from you, is just to 
Let Me Go

All I want from you, is just to to 
Let Me Go
