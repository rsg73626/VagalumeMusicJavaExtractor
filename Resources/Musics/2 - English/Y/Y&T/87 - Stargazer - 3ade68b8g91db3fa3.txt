STARGAZER

Smokes and coke, beer and the band
God, tell me when will this all end?
Each day I do this again and again
Oh, no…
Making my life a game of hope and chance
Quit right now, well I can't
I have to chase my dreams to an end
Oh, oh…
It's run and sweat, it's do or die
I have to make it, it's my life
And when I get there, will I find piece of mind
Oh, oh…
CHORUS:
Do you find your life going 'round and 'round?
Do you think that you're the only one who's on the ground?
And do you find your life going 'round and 'round?
Do you think that you're the only one who's on the ground?
(Down and out)
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round and
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
When I was young my mother told me
"Son, it's time to quit the band and get a job.
Save all your money, your hard earned pay."
What I'm saving for?
Save, save…
CHORUS
I'm a Stargazer
I'm a Stargazer
I'm a Stargazer
