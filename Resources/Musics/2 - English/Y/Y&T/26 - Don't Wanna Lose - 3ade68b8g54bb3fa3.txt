DON'T WANNA LOSE

When you said you’d be mine, girl
Did you mean it for all time?
Or will my love be a memory?
If you ever leave me lonely
Don’t know just where I’d go
’Cause you got all I want
And all I’ll ever need
CHORUS:
Don’t wanna lose you, don’t wanna lose
No, you can’t say goodbye to our love
Don’t wanna lose you, don’t wanna lose
You got the fire burning my soul
Don’t wanna lose your love
Now you showed me love can be
More than pain and misery
That I felt before you
So hold on tight and don’t let go now
Let the strength in our love grow
Just say you will for eternity
CHORUS
When you said you’d be mine, girl
Did you mean it for all time?
Or will my love be a memory?
If you ever leave me lonely
Don’t know just where I’d go
’Cause you got all I want
And I ever need
CHORUS:
Don’t wanna lose you, don’t wanna lose
No, you can’t say goodbye to our love
Don’t wanna lose you, don’t wanna lose
You got the fire burning my soul
You’ve got to stay with me
Don’t wanna lose your love
Please tell me that you always will
Don’t wanna lose your love…
