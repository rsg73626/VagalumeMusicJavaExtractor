TEMPTATION

Here we are just you and I alone
Passions high—we both know this is wrong
You got a lover, and baby so do I
Temptation’s burn’n deep inside
I close my eyes and I can feel ya next to me
Oh so long my secret fantasy
You like the danger
But I don’t like the price we’ll pay
CHORUS:
Can’t fight this
Temptation
Now I’m in the danger zone
Temptation
You make it so hard to say no
Temptation
Now just leave a good thing alone
It’s not too late to turn and walk away
It’s gett’n harder the longer that you stay
Don’t lead me on, girl
Just turn your pretty head and walk away
CHORUS:
You’re driv’n me insane
Temptation
Now I’m in the danger zone
Temptation
You make it so hard to say no
Temptation
Now just leave a good thing alone
