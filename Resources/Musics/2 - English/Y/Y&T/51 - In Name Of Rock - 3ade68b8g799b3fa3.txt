IN NAME OF ROCK

He was a tough fifteen
He heard the guitar scream
And he knew he’d never be the same
It was magic
Like fire running through his veins
Got him a six string
Make your head ring
They said the boy must be insane
No one could understand
How good that guitar felt in his hands
He played it loud
To shut the whole world out
He thought he heard the crowd scream
Calling out his name
And he showed ‘em all
CHORUS:
In the name of rock & roll
He stood tall
In the name of rock & roll
He did it all
In the name of rock & roll
And he never stopped
That skinny kid was born to rock
Played the scene cool and clean
Black bandana on his skin tight jeans
On the streets
They said the kid was gonna be king, yeah
Felt the beat, felt the heat
The road was hotter than he thought it could be
Closed his eyes
And never stopped chasing that dream, that’s
right
Could he make the grade?
Does he got what it takes?
To go all the way
Well, there’s a price to pay, yeah
But he showed ‘em all
CHORUS:
In the name of rock & roll
He stood tall
In the name of rock & roll
He heard the call
In the name of rock & roll
Well he did it all
And you know he’d do it all again
In the name of rock & roll
He stood tall
In the name of rock & roll
He stood tall
In the name of rock & roll
Yeah, he did it all
In the name of rock & roll
No he never stopped...that skinny kid was born
to rock
On a hot summer night
Under the white spotlight
You shoulda heard that boy play
He heard ‘em call out his name
He heard the crowd scream
This kid is hot
You’d better watch out, he’s gonna blow you
away
Like an old gunslinger
With a quick itchy finger
That’s squeezin’ on the trigger for fame
When he took the stage
He knew they’d remember his name
He showed ‘em all!
In the name of rock & roll
He stood tall
In the name of rock & roll
And he heard the call
In the name of rock & roll
Yeah, he did it all, and you know he’d do it all again
In the name of rock & roll
He stood tall
In the name of rock & roll
He showed ‘em all
In the name of rock & roll
He never stopped, that skinny kid was born to rock…
