TAKE YOU TO THE LIMIT

Credit card in her black pursette
Gold and diamonds, only the best
With a quarter time walk, make you bite
your lip
Melts me with the rhythm, that’s so
tragically hip
I love the way she moves the room
And caught the breath of her perfume
It whispers, “I'll be there soon”
To make you, take you
CHORUS:
Take you to the limit
Going over the top
Gonna take you to the limit
Ain’t never gonna stop
Says her sugar daddy’s not at home
She took me there so we could be alone
My thoughts were racing with a burning
desire
My blood was boiling and my heart was on
fire
Her eyes smiled as she touched my hand
It was a language I could understand
And then she whispered by the baby grand,
Take me, make me
CHORUS
Oh baby...
Don’t you ever stop
Oh, honey
You take me to the top
Oh, you got me anytime you want me baby
I love the way she moved the room
And caught the breath of her perfume
It still whispers, “I'll be there soon”
To make you, take you
CHORUS
