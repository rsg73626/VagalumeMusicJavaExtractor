HARD TIMES

Goodbye, goodbye, rock and roller
I said farewell, my friend
Time has slipped by much too, much too quickly
Looks like we’ve nearly reached the end
Dreams won't last forever
And just like the wind will change
CHORUS:
Ooh, there’s been hard times
Hold on tight, now, it’s gonna get better
Goodbye, gotta be movin’ on
Hard times
Hard times ain’t gonna last forever
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, hard times
Darkness comes and she is lonely
You can hear her cry without a sound
Shattered dreams, now love is only
Broken pieces on the ground
Well, tears won’t last forever
Just like the wind will change
CHORUS
