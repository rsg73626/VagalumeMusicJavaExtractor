BARROOM BOOGIE

I was getting’ real legless, I was feeling no
pain
Checkin’ out all the women playin’
barroom games
Ratin’ all the women from one to ten
Said: “Bartender set them up again”
Come on, have a drink on me
Cut loose, make it double, three
All right, gonna get me some
Oh man, look what just walked in
A woman so fine calls for sexual crime
I said: “Hey, baby, your crib or mine?”
She said: “Unless you’re a star or got a
Ph.D.
Or lotsa money, honey, don’t you talk to
me”
Come on, give me a break
Cut loose, she slapped my face
Oh, I knew it was love
Oh, back off
All I need is love
Come on, lighten up, baby
You gotta give me some, okay
I just need me some love
Asked another sweetie: “Can I buy you a
drink?”
Well she ordered everything but the
barroom sink
So, I figure I got me an investment here
When, oh, King Kong’s double appears
And he don’t share
Come on, I did no wrong
Cut loose, oh, he slid me down the bar
Get down, get back up again
Alright, well the message is clear
Come on, give me a break
Jump back, oh, she slapped my face
Oh, I knew it was love
Woke up next morning with a trash can
head
When I looked to my left, oh know, I
wished I was dead
There’s Frankenstein's daughter all curled
up on me
I said: “I gotta go home, it’s an emergency”
She said: “But you are home”
Come on, threw me back on the bed
Get down, oh, she blew my head
Oh man, never again
Cut loose, too, too loose
Oh no, I’m hittin’ the floor
All right, I give in
Come on baby, let’s do it again
Come on, one more time, baby
