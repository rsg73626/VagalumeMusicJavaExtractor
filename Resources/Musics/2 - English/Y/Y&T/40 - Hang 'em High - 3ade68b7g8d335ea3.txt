HANG 'EM HIGH

Walk like a warrior through the shadows of the night
Shatter the silence with our screams
Like a tiger, move in for the kill
We're gonna get what we need
We stand together, feel it closing in
Electric shock through our veins
Power of numbers cannot be denied
Let's stand up and show how we feel

Hang 'em High
Band together
Hang 'em High
Through the night
Hang 'em High
Band together
And we always will survive
Reach for the sky

Soldier of fortune - always on the run
Your enemy lies within
You must escape from the shackles in your mind
Stand like a warrior and win

Join our ranks - there ain't no losers here
as long as we never divide
We are a force so strong we never have to run
Let's stand up and show how we feel

Hang 'em High
Band together
Hang 'em High
Through the night
Hang 'em High
Band together
And we always will survive
Reach for the sky

Walk like a warrior through the shadows of the night
Shatter the silence with our screams
Power of numbers cannot be denied
Let's stand up and show how we feel

Hang 'em High
Stand together
Hang 'em High
Through the night
Hang 'em High
Band together
And we always will survive
Reach for the sky
