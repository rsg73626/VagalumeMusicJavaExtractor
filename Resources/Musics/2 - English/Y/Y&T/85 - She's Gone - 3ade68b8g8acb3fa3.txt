SHE'S GONE

In the morning—don’t talk about love
In the evening—don’t talk about love
Talk about suffer—talk about pain
Ooh my baby—she said all there is to say
She says it’s over
Over and over
It hurts so much I can’t stop
This ringing in my head
CHORUS:
She’s gone
She’s not my baby now
Long gone
She’s not my baby now
She’s gone
She turned her back and walked away
I gotta learn how ta face—she’s gone
She’s not my baby now
Long gone
She’s not my baby now
She’s gone
She said goodbye to yesterday
Ooh, yesterday
I’m cryin’ in the rain
Oh, emotions won’t wash away
I feel so lost—no one to blame
Ooh now baby—I’m never gonna be the
same
She says it’s over
Over and over
It hurts so much I can’t stop
This ringing in my head
Ooh now baby—can’t take the pain
Tears are fallin’—never be the same
I reach out—just to hold you near
How can you say, girl—you don’t love me
anymore
Now all that’s left—is me screaming on the
floor
CHORUS
