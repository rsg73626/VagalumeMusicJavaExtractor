ROCK'N ROLL'S GONNA SAVE THE WORLD

Kings and queens and presidents
Are tryin' to take the world in hand
Jokers and freaks and Arab sheiks
Are fightin' over chunks of sand
But Oh
My eyes have seen the glory
For the coming of the chord

Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Don't you know that's the way we're gonna change it
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Rock & Roll!

You don't need to fight when you're rockin' right

Tin soldiers march around the world
No matter what the people say
One man makes all the policies
While the rest of us get blown away

Yes
Tonight you got the power
To lift your voices up and scream!

Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Don't you know that's the way we're gonna change it
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Rock & Roll!

We'll burn it up tonight
Burn with all our might
We don't need to fight when we're rockin' right

Solo: Dave Meniketti

Come on now everybody
Won't you join me in my dream?
Now's the time to lift your voices
From a whisper to a scream

Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Don't you know that's the way we're gonna change it
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Rock & Roll!

We need to rock (rock)
We need to roll (rock)
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
We gotta rock (rock)
To take control (rock)
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
We need to rock (rock)
We need to roll (rock)
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
We gotta rock (rock)
To take control (rock)
Rock & Roll - come on!

Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Don't you know that's the way we're gonna change it
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Listen everybody we're gonna rearrange it
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Yes we're gonna save the world
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
It's gonna save the world
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Don't you know that's the way we're gonna change it
Rock & Roll's gonna save the world
Rock & Roll!
