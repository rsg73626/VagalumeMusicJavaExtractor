BREAK OUT TONIGHT

The streets are misty in the morning light
The fog hides everything from view
It's time to make a move to change my life
I’ve gotta make my dreams come true
'Cuz I know there's something more inside of me
I'm losin' my mind livin' a lie
I won't get nowhere if I don't break free
I'm not runnin' away but I just gotta try, to
CHORUS:
Break out tonight
The door's within my reach
Break out tonight
’N I don't need no key
Break out tonight
I got the power, I want the glory
And now it's time to do or die
Break out tonight
I hear a siren and I feel the heat
A prowling shark in black and white
A painted angel handcuffed in the seat
A child cries alone and dies without a fight
And all these dead-end streets keep tellin' me
I'm losin' my chance the longer I wait
They say you can't escape your destiny
So I'm makin' my move before it's too late, to
CHORUS
You wanna make your dreams reality
But something's got you caught in a vise
They'll try to tear you down and fit you in
So break open the cage if you wanna fly
CHORUS
