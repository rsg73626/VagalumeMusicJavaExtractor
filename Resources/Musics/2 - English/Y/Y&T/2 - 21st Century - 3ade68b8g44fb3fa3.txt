21ST CENTURY

Oh, it's so tired
This social mutation
Solving everything at the end of a gun
Can we spill the blood
From all this hatred
And pass the point of no return
Cause, I know
There's gonna be some changes, changes
From the wake of our time - I wanna be
there
Maybe in the 21st century
We can live life like it ought to be - in our
time
Been torn down
Convicted & lied to
Breeding ignorance to make the same
mistakes
Well, it's past time
To make the right moves
Take a chance & a leap of faith
Cause, I know
We've got the means to change it, change
The fate of our time - I wanna be there
Well, maybe in the 21st century
We can make it better than it used to be - in
our time
Maybe in the 21st century
We can live life as it ought to be - in our
minds
Well it's our time
To stop the madness
And take the rap for our own mistakes
Cause, I know
There's gonna be some changes, changes
From the wake of our time
Oh, stop the madness
This cycle of rage
There must be a new way
Well, maybe in the 21st century
We can live life as it ought to be - in our
minds
Maybe in the 21st century
We can make it better than it used to be - in
our time
Maybe in the 21st century
We can be everything we ought to be - in
our minds
