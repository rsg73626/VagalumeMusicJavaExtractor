DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

So broke, can't pay attention
But my dog is still my friend
So broke, can't pay attention
But my dog is still my friend
Until I had to sell his bone
Now my dog-gone run away from home
And I don't know what to do
Spent some time in Texas
And I swear I was alone
Spent some time in Texas
Baby, I swear I was alone
Now it's 9 months down the road
And it's junior on the telephone
And I don't know what to do
I ain't got no clue
Baby, I swear I've been true
And I don't know what to do
Call out the detectives
'Cause I'm lost out here alone
Call out the detectives
Don't know where I belong
They say you got to be your own man
But I don't even know who I am
And I don't know what to do
I ain't got no clue
No, I don't know what to do
I'm just a happy fool
