MY HEART PLAYS TOO

Lately I've come to see
That your love and I can't be
Your love and I canâ€™t be
Sometimes I think I'm mad
'Cause the life I've chosen is so sad
The life I've chose is so sad
So when you hear me play,
You now my heart plays too
My heart plays too
My heart plays too, yeah
Music is my role,
Every note I hit, hits my soul
Every note I hit, hits my soul
You know my heart plays
So let me go and I'm gone
From town to town I will roam
See you soon
See you all in my song
So when you hear me play
You know my heart plays too
My heart plays too
My heart plays too, yeah
My heart plays too
My heart plays too, yeah
My heart, baby, my heart
My heart plays too, yeah
