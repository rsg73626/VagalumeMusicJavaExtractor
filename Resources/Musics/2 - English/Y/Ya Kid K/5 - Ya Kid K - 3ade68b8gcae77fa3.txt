YA KID K

Come on
Move this

Shake that body
Shake that body
Shake that body
Shake that body

People don't you know
It's about time
Can't you hear the jam is pumping
While you taste the peace of mine
Many different flavours
And the bass is strong
Get into the hot stuff
Play me for a little song

Baby let me show
How to do this
You gotta move this
You'r doing fine
There's nothing to it
You've gotte grove it
Come on and move this
Shake that body for me

People don't know
It's about time...

Can't you feel the mellow crawling fast
Drum 'o baby rhythms blast
Pump it pump it  pump it up
Bet xou can't make this jam stop

You gotta move this

Toes feet tapping
Fingers snapping
Hands clapping
Mamma's rapping
Talkin 'bout our cold laughing
Shut up and do the walk

Use what you got show me
You're on the floor so let me see
Don't say nothing 'less I saw
And remember I like it raw

You've gotta move this...
