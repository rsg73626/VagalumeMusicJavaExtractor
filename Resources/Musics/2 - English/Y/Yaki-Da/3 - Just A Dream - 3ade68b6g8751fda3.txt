JUST A DREAM

I'm just a dream.

Fade away now.
Fade away now.

I'm just a dream,
Go back to where you came from;
When there's a problem,
You go there;
Up to your highlands,
Doing what you don't dare;
So fade away and leave me here.

Fade away now.
Fade away now.

I'm just a dream.
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just a dream.

Would you believe in changing places?
I could be you for just one day,
So I'll see;
How does the world turn out from your side?
It is hard living in between.

Fade away now.
Fade away now.

I'm just a dream...

Are you a knight hunting for treasure?
Take me along, I'll be your queen;
Let me see;
Who is the person on my sofa?
Are you yellow or brave today?

Life is a beautiful thing,
I know that;
But you don't know what I'm going through,
No-oh-oh-oh.
You never question the things you don't see,
'Cause you're living in a dream world of you own.

Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Fade away now.

I'm just a dream.
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just a dream.

I'm just a dream.
Oh, I'm just a dream.

I'm just a dream...

I'm just a dream.

I'm just a dream...
