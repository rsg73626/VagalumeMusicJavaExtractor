RESCUE ME TONIGHT

I can see you, when I close my eyes;
I hold you in my arms, pretend that you are mine;
I wanna break through, leave all my memories behind;
Forget the dream that I will never find.

So cold deep inside-
Need your attention, somehow.

Rescue me tonight,
Heal my broken heart with tenderness,
And with sweet caress;
Rescue me tonight,
Need you here beside me more each day,
More than words can say;
Don't let me stay here waiting;
Don't make me cry;
Rescue me tonight.

Strange emotions, all my pride has gone;
I don't care if I beg; I don't care if I'm weak;
Desperation, that one day you will be here,
To save my soul before I fall too deep.

Only fear left inside;
I hunger for passion, somehow.

Rescue me tonight,
Heal my broken heart with tenderness,
And with sweet caress;
Rescue me tonight,
Need you here beside me more each day,
More than words can say;
Don't let me stay here waiting;
Don't make me cry;
Rescue me tonight.

I'm falling.
Calling.

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Rescue me tonight,
Heal my broken heart with tenderness,
And with sweet caress;
(Oh-ah-ah-ah-ah)Rescue me tonight,
Need you here beside me more each day,
More than words can say;
Don't let me stay here waiting;
Don't make me cry;
Rescue me tonight.

(Oh-ah-ah-ah-ah)
