PRIDE OF AFRICA

Cape-Cairo track runs through the continent,
But is incomplete.

Pride of Africa is going through the heart of Africa;
Pride of Africa, the track of south-east Africa;
I don't care about the Blue Train,
Here's from Africa, with love;
Pride of Africa, I'm travelling through the heart of Africa.

Oh oh oh, with the Pride of Africa;
Oh oh oh, in the heart of Africa;
I see many different places,
From Cape Town to Dar-Es-Salaam,
Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.

Cape Town to Kimberley,
And Warrenton, and Bulawayo;
Up to Kapiri Mposhi, in the north;
That's how the main track goes,
And after that, there's another line,
Built by the Chinese:
The Tazara track.

Pride of Africa is going through the heart of Africa;
Pride of Africa, the track of south-east Africa;
I don't care about the Blue Train,
Here's from Africa, with love;
Pride of Africa, I'm travelling through the heart of Africa.

Oh oh oh, with the Pride of Africa;
Oh oh oh, in the heart of Africa;
I see many different places,
From Cape Town to Dar-Es-Salaam,
Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.

Falling water;
I want to feel it touch my skin,
So warm at Victoria,
Under the falls bewtween Zimbabwe and Zambia.

Pride of Africa.
Heart of Africa.

Pride of Africa, the track of south-east Africa;
I don't care about the Blue Train,
Here's from Africa, with love;
Pride of Africa, I'm travelling through the heart of Africa.

Oh oh oh, with the Pride of Africa;
Oh oh oh, in the heart of Africa;
Oh oh oh, with the Prida of Africa;
Oh oh oh, in the heart of Africa;
I see many different places,
From Cape Town to Dar-Es-Salaam,
Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.

Nothing seems to change but the time;
Such a beautiful ride.
