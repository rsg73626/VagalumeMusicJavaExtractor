TIME TO COMPREHEND

Time to Comprehend 

Here I am, trying to understand
what you want...
here we fight 
when you ask me
about my life style
and about sincerity...
to say, I will never say 
my friend, cause you're
just my enemy...
you wanna know,
everything about my life 
and the reasons 
to understand
my attitude, 
what i have to do,
put me out from your head,
and forget about the time,
when we were together
i find, my time,
is only in my mind
no time, for you
to understabd about me 
and now you can 
try to help yourself 
leave me alone
to comprehend myself
