IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE MURDER

It's beginning to look a lot like murder
Everywhere you go!
Senpai's bothersome childhood friend
is flirting with him again
She wants him, but I'll never let him go!
It's beginning to look a lot like murder
Lots of blood and gore!

But the prettiest sight to see is senpai beneath a tree
The boy I adore!
A rusty pipe made of lead and a blow to the head
Will take care of kokona-chan!
A shiny sharp axe and one glorious whack
To eliminate osana-chan!

Oh, golly, I can hardly wait for school to start again!
It's beginning to look a lot like murder
Everywhere you go!
Well, I could send her straight to hell
or just get her expelled
Stab her quick, or gut her nice and slow!

It's beginning to look a lot like murder
Killing is an art!
Won't you please stop your struggling?
You know I just want one thing
To carve out your heart!
