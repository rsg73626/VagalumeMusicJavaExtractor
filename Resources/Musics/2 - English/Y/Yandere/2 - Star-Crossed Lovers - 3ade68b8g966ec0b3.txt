STAR-CROSSED LOVERS

Like the blossom of a cherry tree
My heart turns pink within your vicinity
There is no one else but you
No one else but me for you

They wanna take away our happy ending
Suffocate our happy ending
Little they know how my love is true
They try to put to death our happy ending
Sabotage our happiness
Rest assured our happy ending will come through

Love Sickness - in fact, it's killing me
With others hungry for my only remedy
But, oh
The Friday dusk, they'll never see
If only they knew
There's no one else but me for you

They wanna take away our happy ending
Suffocate our happy ending
Little they know how my love is true
They try to put to death our happy ending
Sabotage our happiness
Rest assured our happy ending will come through

Loving you
Is all I've ever known
And all I aim to prove
Is that we're taking life on like Star-Crossed Lovers

Loving you
Is all I've ever known
And all I aim to prove
Is that we're taking life on like Star-Crossed Lovers
