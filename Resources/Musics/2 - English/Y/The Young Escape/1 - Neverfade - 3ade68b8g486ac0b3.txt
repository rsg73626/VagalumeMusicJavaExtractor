NEVERFADE

Are we losing control
Falling deeper into the unknown?
And chasing our ghosts
Trying to break through these shadows alone

We've been living in a land of confusion
Limping from our cuts and our bruises
Clock spinning on the time we are losing
Every day, every day
We've been walking in a midnight of blindness
Searching for the road, but it's winding
We're looking for the truth, we can't find it
So, we say, show the way

Shine like the brightest star
You're the light that never fades
Light that never fades
Shine, 'cause it's who You are
Your love could never fade
You're the light that never fades

So, we give You control
And we make You the source of our hope
And carry us home
Fix the pieces and roll back the stones

And we can see there's a point we've been missing
Believe You're the reason for breathing
And all we need is what You're already giving
Every day, every day, so

Shine like the brightest star
You're the light that never fades
Light that never fades
Shine, 'cause it's who You are
Your love could never fade
You're the light that never fades

Fade, never fades
Fade, never fades
Fade, never fades
Fade, never fades

Shine like the brightest star
You're the light that never fades
Light that never fades
Shine, 'cause it's who You are
Your love could never fade
You're the light that never fades

Oh, ooh, You're the light that never fades
Light that never fades
Fade, never fades
Fade, never fades
