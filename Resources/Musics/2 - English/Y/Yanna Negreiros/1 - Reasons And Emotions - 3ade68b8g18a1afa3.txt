REASONS AND EMOTIONS

Say, what can I say.
If I'm singing now
you listen to another person

Because sometimes I think
I am not the best for you
But sometimes I think
What could be
The best for us
I just want you to know

Between reason and emotion to exit
We enforce the penalty
If not now then, no matter
You can wait

Feel, I can feel
If everything in a second end
I will not have the escape

Because sometimes I think
I am not the best for you
But sometimes I think it could be
The best for us
I just want you to know

Between reason and emotion to exit
We enforce the penalty
If not now then no matter
You can wait, I wait, I can wait ..

Between reason and emotion to exit
We enforce the penalty
If not now then no matter
You can wait

Between reason and emotion to exit
We enforce the penalty
If not now then no matter
You can wait, I wait
I can wait, I wait ...
