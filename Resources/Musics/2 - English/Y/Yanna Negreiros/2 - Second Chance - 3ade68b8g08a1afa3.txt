SECOND CHANCE

Certain things come and go
And vanish with time
But what happened between us
Never forget
And see you again made me so well
Close your eyes and relive
All over again

I follow his gaze
I can not let this pass
The second chance I have
To show what I
And be who I am

From a past where missed
Future sorry
Memories have always remembered
I go to a movie
Where to see you again made me so well
Close your eyes and relive
All over again

I follow his gaze
I can not let this pass
The second chance I have
To show what I
And be who I am

If life is not like us either
So much wrong that I discouraged
And every time makes me suffer, do suffer
I always wanted to find a way out
On the good side, which is worth fighting
For the dreams that gave me life, life gave me

I follow his gaze
I can not let this pass
The second chance I have
To show what I
And be who I am
