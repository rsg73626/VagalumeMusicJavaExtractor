HUNDRED MILES

Come here and visit my world
Come here and visit my world
Did the street shining stars
Our love is the only way
Don't get lost cause I'm waiting
Summer feelings are waiting, boy
You and me is more than hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than lonely days
It's our time to go
Dance with me, one more time
You and me is more than hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than lonely days
It's our time to come, dance with me
One more time

Come here and visit my world

Did the street shining stars
Our love is the only way
Don't get lost cause I am waiting
Summer feelings are waiting, boy
You and me is more than hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than lonely days
It's our time to go

Da-da dance with me one more time

Dance with me one more time
You and me is more than lonely days
It's our time to go
Da-da dance with me one more time
You and me is more than hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than-tha-tha
It's our time to go
Dance with me one more time
