TOGETHER

I don't need a reason
To be by your side
No matter the season
Our plans will be alive
Got something to live for
It's so hard to find
Just live for the moment
Keep on running wild

Things happen, we reunite
Come on, get up, just do it right
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Close your eyes as she said to the sky
Keep going day and night
You can find even if we're feeling better
When we are together

Hey, take me by the hand, I'll make you stay
Let you know that you can count on me
Take me by the hand, I'll make you stay
I think we're better together

I think we're better together
I think we're better together

We are on a mission
It comes from inside
Don't need no permission
No we won't draw the finish line
We're walking the same road
We share the same coats
This is what we came for
We will spread the love

Things happen, we reunite
Come on, get up, just do it right
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Close your eyes as she said to the sky
Keep going day and night
You can find even if we're feeling better
When we are together

Hey, take me by the hand, I'll make you stay
Let you know that you can count on me
Take me by the hand, I'll make you stay
I think we're better together

I think we're better together
I think we're better together
