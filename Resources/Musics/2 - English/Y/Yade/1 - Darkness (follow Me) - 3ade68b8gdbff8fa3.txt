DARKNESS (FOLLOW ME)

Into a world of light i was born
I child of darkness full of hate rate
From many years I kindly obey
To all the things society taught me 
And now my time has come to revolt

To show this evil where i have come from
And now itâ€™s your turn to decide
If you will stay you will let me lead you

Well you follow me 

The time has come for you to decide 
If you wanna to leave it all behind 
To open the gate to my world

Well you follow me

You have to face all of your fears
You will be crying a thousand years 
Until the end you will reach yourself 

Well you follow me into my darkness
Well you follow me

Judgment day will come for all that was date 
No prisoner swell be taken
Final war is near, still there is time 
To save your damned souls

Follow me into my darkness
Follow me you little lumps

Let me led you into my kingdom
Let me show you where I reign
Come on, follow me

(x2)
The time has come for you to decide 
If you wanna to leave it all behind 
To open the gate to my world

Well you follow me
You have to face all of your fears
You will be crying a thousand years 
Until the end you will reach yourself 

Well you follow me into my darkness
