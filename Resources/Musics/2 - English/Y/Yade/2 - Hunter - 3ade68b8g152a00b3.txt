HUNTER

I'm roaming through the night
With the moon being my companion
The night is cold outside, but inside my blood is boiling
Red velvet on pale skin, I drew first blood tonight

Your blood flows on white snow, you'll be my prize tonight
Don't turn around just run away
I am a hunter you are my prey
No one will stand between us

And when you think you have escaped,
My shiny blade will bring you down
And I enjoy while life emerges you
