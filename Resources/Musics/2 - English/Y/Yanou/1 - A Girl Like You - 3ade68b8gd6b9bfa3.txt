A GIRL LIKE YOU

I've never known a girl like you before
Now just like in a song from days of yore
I've never known a girl like you before
Here you come a knockin', knockin' on my door

I've never known a girl like you before
I've never met a girl like you before

And now you've come along
Yes, you've come along
You've made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically
And now you've come along
Yes, you've come along
And now you've come along

I've never known a girl like you before
Now just like in a song from days of yore
I've never known a girl like you before
Here you come a knockin', knockin' on my door

And now you've come along
Yes, you've come along
And now you've come along
