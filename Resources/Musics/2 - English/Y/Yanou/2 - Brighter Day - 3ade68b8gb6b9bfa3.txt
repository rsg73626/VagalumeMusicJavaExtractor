BRIGHTER DAY

So you've gotta lose some pressure
Somebody's got you down
So you're looking for an answer
That will turn your world around

You know, I might sound crazy
But did you ever seen the light?
Shine away, got nothing left to say
It's a brighter day, it's a brighter day

You gotta open up your eyes
About to come to realize
It's a brighter day, it's a brighter day

Buried deep and not in hide
You can barely touch the sky
It's a brighter day, it's a brighter day
