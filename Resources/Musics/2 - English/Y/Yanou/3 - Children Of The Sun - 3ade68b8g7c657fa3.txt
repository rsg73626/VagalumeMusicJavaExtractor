CHILDREN OF THE SUN

All the people
Go get together and hear me sing
My song of freedom and love
In a world of children that cries no more

One race, one heart
It's all leaving you if we've gone fall apart
Live up, I don't give up

We are the children of the sun

We are the children of the sun
Me sing the children of the sun
 (same race)
And if we fight for our rights we become

Children of the sun
(Children of the sun we are)
Together one by one 
Me sing the children of the sun
And if we fight for our rights we become
(We are the children of the sun)

(We are the children of the sun)

All the people
Go get together and hear me sing
My song of freedom and love
In a world of children that cries no more

One race, one heart
It's all leaving you if we've gone fall apart
Live up, I don't give up

We are the children of the sun

(Children of the sun we are)

We are the children of the sun

We are the children of the sun
(Children of the sun we are)
Me sing the children of the sun
 (same race)
And if we fight for our rights we become

Children of the sun
(Children of the sun we are)
Together one by one 
Me sing the children of the sun
And if we fight for our rights we become
(Children of the sun)

(We are the children of the sun)
(One love)
(One heart)
(One destination)
(One understanding)
We are the children of the sun
