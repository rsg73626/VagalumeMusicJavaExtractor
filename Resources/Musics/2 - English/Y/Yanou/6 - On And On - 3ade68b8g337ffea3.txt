ON AND ON

I didn't mean it,
And yeah I cheated on,
You, my love,
You, my love.

My heart is beatin',
Are you leavin' me alone,
On my own?

And then the tears in my eyes,
I'll miss you right by my side.
I'm waiting for you,
I'm waiting for you.

Forgive me just one of my lies,
Release me from one aliby.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

On and on, your voice is callin'.
On and on, it's on my mind.
Don't you know, I can't let go,
Never, never 'cause my love goes...

On and on, your voice is callin'.
On and on, it's on my mind.
Don't you know, I can't let go,
Never, never 'cause my love goes on!

And then the tears in my eyes,
I'll miss you right by my side.
I'm waiting for you,
I'm waiting for you.

Forgive me just one of my lies,
Release me from one aliby.
I gotta have you,
