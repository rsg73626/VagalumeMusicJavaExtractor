THE MORNING AFTER

sitting in the dark
hiding from the light
I’m not like all the others
they’re never satisfied

all these girls dressed up
in fancy clothes
their skin that shines
they’re laughing loud and dance
trying to pull the guys

what if I really want to
but don’t have the guts to tell you?

I’m not gonna hide
the morning after
I’m not gonna hide
from love

I don’t know why it’s so hard
to get words out of my mouth
guess that I’m afraid of people talking all the time
I live alone on my cloud

maybe I really want to love you
but don’t find the words to tell you

I’m not gonna hide
the morning after
I’m not gonna hide
from love

who’s gonna break the spell?
help me break out of this silence
come and get me out of my shell

sitting in the dark
hiding from the light
the party’s almost over
I’m ready for the night

I’m not gonna hide
the morning after
I’m not gonna hide
from love
from love
