BACK AGAINST THE WALL

the world and his wife
know it’s a compromise
there are good times
and bad times in your life
thought I knew it all
thought I’d take my chance
to leave home

but things went not as well
as I thought they would
and soon my life
became a living hell
I wanted it to end
thought I’d take my chance
to let go
some say yes
some say no

I had my back against the wall
no-one I could call
then you came into my life
boy, you made me feel alive
we’d been talking all night long
you showed me what went wrong
and much to my surprise
you killed my alibis
when I had my back against the wall

day after day
there’s a storm of problems coming after me
then I know it’s hard to see
there’s another way
guess I never opened up my heart
but now I’m ready for a new start

I had my back against the wall
no-one I could call
then you came into my life
boy, you made me feel alive
we’d been talking all night long
you showed me what went wrong
and much to my surprise
you killed my alibis
when I had my back against the wall

life is not that hard
when you find someone to show you the way
listen to your heart
a little love goes a long way
to chase the blues away
