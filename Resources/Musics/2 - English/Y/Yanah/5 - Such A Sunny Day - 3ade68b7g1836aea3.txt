SUCH A SUNNY DAY

such a sunny day
everything’s okay
no cloud that fills my sky
I can feel the love
shining in your eyes
I hope that the sun won’t go down

feels like I’m dreaming
dreaming by your side
and the world seems so
so far away

such a sunny day
carry me away
through the clear blue skies
I can hear your voice
telling sweet little lies
it makes me feel sunny inside

feels like I’m dreaming
dreaming by your side
and the world seems so
so far away

(solo)

feels like I’m dreaming
dreaming by your side
and the world seems so
so far away
and the world seems so
so far away
and the world seems so
so far away
