YES OR NO

I was lost and lonely
then I bumped right into you
you’re my one and only
but afraid of what this love might do
this is here and now
and it’s time to go my way
you’re too complicated
what’s that silly game you play?

you want me to go
you want me to stay here
you don’t really know
you want me to go
you want me to stay here
But I ain’t gonna wait dear
‘cause I wanna know
is it: yes yes or no?

all the odds against us
our luck has crossed your lack of faith
you’re afraid to break it
for what is broken can’t be made
another doubt created
with another lame excuse
you got our love frustrated
but you had your time to choose

you want me to go
you want me to stay here
you don’t really know
you want me to go
you want me to stay here
But I ain’t gonna wait dear
‘cause I wanna know
is it: yes yes or no?

Why don’t you read the signs
you’re selfish and you’re blind
You come and go
And I’ve lost too much to find
a love that can’t unwind
does it show?
Make up your mind

you want me to go
you want me to stay here
you don’t really know
you want me to go
you want me to stay here
But I ain’t gonna wait dear
‘cause I wanna know
is it: yes yes or no?
