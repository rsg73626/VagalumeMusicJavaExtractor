WAITING FOR A MIRACLE

I can see myself
swimming in a dream
feelin’ heaven blessed
I’m the mermaid queen
divin’ to Atlantis
city of the sea

I can hear the song
of a wheeping whale
I can see white pearls
and a golden grail
but not a soul around
not a man in town

Ooh I
I’m waiting for a miracle
Ooh I
I’m calling to a saint

I can see myself
waitin’ on my isle
counting empty shells
‘till the tide is high
did the waves bring
a man ashore?

Ooh I
I’m waiting for a miracle
Ooh I
I’m calling to a saint
I’m calling to a saint

livin’ in exile
‘still don’t know my sin
waitin’ for the day
when my ship comes in
will my saviour come
and take me aboard?

ooh I
I’m waiting for a miracle
ooh I
I’m calling to a saint
ooh ooh ooh I
I’m waiting for a miracle
ooh I
I’m calling to a saint
