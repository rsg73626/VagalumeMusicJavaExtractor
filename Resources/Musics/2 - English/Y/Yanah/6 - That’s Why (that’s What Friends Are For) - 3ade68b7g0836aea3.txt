THAT’S WHY (THAT’S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR)

the phone’s been telling me your story
with a crying sound
it drilled into my ears when you said:
‘it’s hard to go on
can’t make it on my own
but no-one needs to know
the worries in my head

you said you were about
to take an odd decision
‘cause you didn’t want your folks
to judge you for what you’d done
but words must be spoken
silence must be broken
someone needs to know
the troubles of your soul

but I hope you don’t mind
that I talked to you
to open your eyes
so don’t worry anymore
‘cause that’s why
that’s what friends are for
that’s why
you need a friend now

the other day you realized
there was no sense in hiding
reality would come and claim its price
you learned to live your life
the way that it should be
you know I’ll be there for you

but you shouldn’t be so kind
better live your life
and open your eyes
so don’t worry anymore
‘cause that’s why
that’s what friends are for
that’s why
you need a friend now

(instrumental)

but I hope you don’t mind
that I talked to you
to open your eyes
so don’t worry anymore
‘cause that’s why
that’s what friends are for
that’s why
you need a friend now
that’s why
you need a friend now
that’s why
