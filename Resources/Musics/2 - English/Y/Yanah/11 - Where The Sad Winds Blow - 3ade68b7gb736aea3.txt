WHERE THE SAD WINDS BLOW

losing somebody you love
taken away by a God that lives above
it’s making you wonder
what is right or wrong
it’s making you wonder
if life’s but a sad song

so please try to understand
what it’s like to lose a friend
whenever I think of him
I feel all alone
like a child in the dark
with a hole in my heart
where the sad winds blow

my life has changed since he’s been gone
and there is nothing I can do to bring him back home
I went to the land where they burried my friend
I talked to the wise man, needed a helping hand

so please try to understand
what it’s like to lose a friend
whenever I think of him
I feel all alone
like a child in the dark
with a hole in my heart
where the sad winds blow

(solo)

so please try to understand
what it’s like to lose a friend
with all this loneliness inside
all I do is killing time
tell me how to rip the tide

so please try to understand
what it’s like to lose a friend
whenever I think of him
I feel all alone
like a child in the dark
with a hole in my heart
where the sad winds blow
where the sad winds blow
