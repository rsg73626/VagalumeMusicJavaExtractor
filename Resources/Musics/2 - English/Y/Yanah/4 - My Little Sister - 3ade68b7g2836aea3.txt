MY LITTLE SISTER

my little sister
she’s about 16
she’s the prettiest girl
you’ve ever seen
she’s got all these worries
bowling in her brain
and she says she’s insane

she cries in the night
life’s too big to handle
she’s waiting for someone
to light a candle
she plays her violin
until it’s day
then all the pain has gone away

my sister, you’re like no-one else
you know you’re being too hard on yourself
lovers may come
and lovers may go
but you’ll always have yourself
and me as your friend

I know life’s a bitch
and then you die
but I think it’s still worth it
at the end of the ride
these things were only meant
to make you stronger
to make you happy
to make you wise

so don’t throw away that gift
and play that violin
let all of our friends come in
let the party begin
I can’t tell you enough
how proud I am
to have a sister like you

my sister, you’re like no-one else
you should love yourself before
you love someone else
lovers may come
and lovers may go
but you’ll always have yourself
and me as your friend

people may say what they like
and you may not like what they say
you’re not like anyone else
you’re not like anyone else

my sister, you should see yourself
the only thing you miss is self-confidence
lovers may come
and lovers may go
but you’ll always have yourself
and me as your friend
