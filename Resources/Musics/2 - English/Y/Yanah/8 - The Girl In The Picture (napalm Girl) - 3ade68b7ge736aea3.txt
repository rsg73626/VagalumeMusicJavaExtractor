THE GIRL IN THE PICTURE (NAPALM GIRL)

she’s only a child
a running, naked child
so vulnerable

she’s only ‘bout 9
thin and so fine
so destructible

she’s all scarified
her arms swung out wide
to relieve the pain

she lives in Trang Bang
where fire falls from the skies
down Highway 1
there’s a girl that screams and cries

and she’s running
always running
they call her the Napalm Girl
but she never gives in
trying to get some peace in this world
saved by the click of a camera
she is the girl in the picture

there’s fire all around her
and fire inside
“it’s too hot, too hot”

she rips off her clothes
but the heat only grows
it’s living under her skin

she’s frozen in time
‘cause she still burns your mind
when you look at her

she lives in Trang Bang
where fire grows on the trees
Down Highway 1
there’s a little girl pleading for peace

and she’s running
always running
this little Napalm Girl
always willing to forgive
trying to get some peace in this world
she’s so strong she can burn your mind
she is the girl in the picture

she lives in Trang Bang
where fire rains from the skies
but she never gives in
trying to get some peace in this world

and she’s running
always running
they call her the Napalm Girl
always willing to forgive
trying to get some peace in this world
always understanding
this little child of war

she is the girl in the picture
