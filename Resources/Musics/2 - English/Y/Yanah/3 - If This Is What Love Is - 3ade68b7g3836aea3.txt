IF THIS IS WHAT LOVE IS

you don’t wanna talk to me
you don’t even look at me
when we kiss and say goodnight
you do your thing and fall asleep
you don’t care if it makes me weep
all through the night

and I’m crying out your name
but for you it’s all the same
if I’m here or filling up the space around you
you just ignore me
you never show me
what’s the matter with you

if this is what love is
if this is how we kiss
you better leave me on my own
if this is how it feels
if this is what it is
I don’t wanna know
I’d rather be alone
Ooh
if this is what love is

you have a meeting after work
you behave like a jerk
when you tell and sell your lies
is this a phase you’re going through
until you’ve found someone new?
shall I close my eyes?

and I’m standing in the dark
and I’m left without a spark
you hide between these walls you built around you
you just annoy me
you just enjoyed me
as long as I pleased you

if this is what love is
if this is how we kiss
you better leave me on my own
if this is how it feels
if this is what it is
I don’t wanna know
I’d rather be alone
Ooh
if this is what love is

and I’m crying in my sleep
for all the secrets that you keep
and all the things that I have said
are just silent in your head
I wonder who you are
You’re acting so bizarre
what’s the matter with you?

You don’t wanna talk to me
You don’t even look at me
when we kiss and say goodnight

if this is what love is
if this is how we kiss
you better leave me on my own
if this is how it feels
if this is what it is
I don’t wanna know
I’d rather be alone
…
Ooh
if this is what love is
