THE BOYS OF SUMMER

nobody on the road
nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
the summer’s out of reach
empty lake, empty streets
the sun goes down alone
I’m driving by your house
though I know you’re not home

but I can see you
your brown skin shining in the sun
you got your hair combed back
and your sunglasses on, baby
and I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
remember how you made me crazy
remember how I made you scream
now I don’t understand what
happened to our love
but baby I’m gonna get you back
I’m gonna show you what I’m made of

but I can see you
your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and you’re
smiling at everyone
and I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone

out on the road today I saw a deadhead
sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“don’t look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was
what did I know?
those days are gone forever
I should just let them go, but

but I can see you
your brown skin shining in the sun
you got that top pulled down
and that radio on, baby
and I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
your brown skin shining in the sun
you got that hair slicked back
and those Wayfarers on, baby
and I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
after the boys of summer have gone
