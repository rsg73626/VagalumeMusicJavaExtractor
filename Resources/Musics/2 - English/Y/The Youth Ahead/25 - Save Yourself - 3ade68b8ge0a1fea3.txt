SAVE YOURSELF

what's the matter with the world today
everything is far from okay
I wish we had superman to save the day
why can't we all get along
chill out and sing a song
until we finally figure out what went wrong
what's the matter with the world today
everything is far from okay
I wish we had superman to save the day
why can't we all get along
chill out and sing a song
until we finally figure out what went wrong

cause I'm tired of everybody telling me the world is gonna end
and I'm tired of watching people die when there is no reason why

bring me back a couple years ago
when I could walk out my door
with no concern that I might not be coming home
there's cars running out of gas
skyline is in the past
and mother nature's finding out she's not so bad

cause I'm tired of everybody telling me the world is gonna end
and I'm tired of watching people die when there is no reason why

there is no reason why...

and I'm tired of everybody telling me the world is gonna end
and I'm tired of watching people die when there is no reason why

there is no reason why...
