JUST LIKE YOU

I knew you for such a short amount of time, but it counts
because I'll never forget the times that we shared
but what I remember most was the smile on your face
and the innocence that came alone you know it made me care

but what I heard that night from your father he said
I want her back so bad
but what meant so much to me is when he said
I wanted her to be just like you

well people come and go, as well as do thoughts
but the memories of you will never drift out of my head
if I could see you now then I'd say it to your face
how much I wish that you would stay and never leave

but what I heard that night from your father he said
I want her back so bad
but what meant so much to me is when he said
I wanted her to be just like you

there comes a point in time when we have to leave this world
but always say goodbye, because you never know when it'll be the last time

so what I heard that night from your father he said
I want her back so bad
but what meant so much to me is when he said
I wanted her to be just like you

just like you

what I heard that night from your father he said
I wanted her to be just like you
I wanted her to be just like you
