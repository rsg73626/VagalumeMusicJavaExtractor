I WANT YOUR GIRLFRIEND

Who is that chick in the burgundy tight shirt? I never seen her before. So I'll walk on up and I'll talk to her. "I got a boyfriend." she says, he looks at me, but then I say .. 
I want your girlfriend .... 
You got the prettiest girlfriend I ever did see, how 'bout you lend her to me? I sing this song to her, but then I'll look at you when I sing the refrain, cause ... 
I want your girlfriend .... 
I'll make her forget you, she's the one for me, and even though I'm selfish, it's the way it's gotta be .... 
I want your girlfriend .... 
I know I'm selfish. I may be wrong, but there's no real reason why I wrote this song. It's not a warning, and it's not a threat, just keep your girlfriends away from me cause I ain't done yet .... 
I want your girlfriend .... 
Your G-I-R-L-F-R-I-E-N-D!!
