STAY TRUE, STAY GOLD

I dreamt about you last night, I held my pillow tight
I woke up thinking you were still around
I wondered if I should call
it's been so long since we last spoke
I shook my head, and closed my eyes to sleep

cause I know you're thinking about me and to call would be a tease
I know you're down on your knees
calling you to just check in would be so selfish of me
it's so hard to let this be

you say I'm all you need, to make you whole make you complete
sorry I just can't stay today
those blue eyes flood at night, I know you just can't say goodbye
stay true, stay gold, don't die away
