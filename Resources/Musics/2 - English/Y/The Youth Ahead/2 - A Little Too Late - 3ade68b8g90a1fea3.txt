A LITTLE TOO LATE

hold the phones, who was that girl
I've never seen her around here before
before today
she's melting my heart, my face is turning red
I gotta think of what to say
before it's too late, before it's too late

cause I don't wanna lie
I think this time I'm right
for the first time in my life
and I don't wanna lie
I think that time I'm right
for the first time in my life

I think I need a little motivation
I think I need a little inspiration
all because I'm breaking out
get me out, get me home
I don't wanna be all alone
I've gotta set this right today
before it's too late, before it's too late

cause I don't wanna lie
I think this time I'm right
for the first time in my life
and I don't wanna lie
I think that time I'm right
for the first time in my life

cause I don't wanna lie
(I think I need a little motivation)
I think this time I'm right
(I think I need a little inspiration)
for the first time in my life
(all because I'm breaking out)
and I don't wanna lie
(get me out, get me home I don't wanna be all alone)
I think this time I'm right
(I've gotta set this right today)
for the first time in my life
(before it's too late, before it's too late)
