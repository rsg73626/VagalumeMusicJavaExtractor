MOVIE SCENES

my life is made up of many exciting things
it takes time to realize that sometimes
but after all I go through, commit to
there is nothing else that I'd rather do

there is nobody else in the world
that I could do just absolutely nothing with
and be so happy, and be so happy
when we, we do nothing at all

your eyes they don't lie
your smile brightens my life
the way you tell me we can always work it out
and when I fall get in deep
you'll knock me back on my feet
I could never do, all of this without you

there is nobody else in the world
that I could do just absolutely nothing with
and be so happy, and be so happy
when we, we do nothing at all

we're on our own, we'll make it up as we go
there's nothing better, than winter weather and you
call out for the day, lay in bed watch tv
nothings better than something

there is nobody else in the world
that I could do just absolutely nothing with
and be so happy, and be so happy
when we, we do nothing
