I'M A FUCK-UP

I'm a fuck-up, they're telling, because my life is amounting to nothing. Who are you to tell me how to live anyway? 
...even though its true, yes, it's true, that I'm a fuck-up, and I'm damn proud if it! Because it's true, yes it's true that I'm screwed up, but whatcha gonna do! 
Even though I'm unemployed, and sleep all day, and stay out all damn night, that doesn't give you the right to tell me how to live! 
I thought I lived in America, the home of the free and the land of opportunity, but you'r telling me what to do! 
No matter what they say, only live life your own way, and if they say it's only true ... tell 'em whatcha gonna do!
