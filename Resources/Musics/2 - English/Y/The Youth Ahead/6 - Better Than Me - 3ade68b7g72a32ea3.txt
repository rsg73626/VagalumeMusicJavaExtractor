BETTER THAN ME

Sometimes I gotta think that things will get better 
When everything is falling down around me and 
My life's a big ol pile of shit 
I can't do anything right no more 
Bad luck's my middle name, what's yours? 
I bet it's doing better than me 

Sometimes you gotta think that things will get better 
When everything seems so hard at times 
But when you're down, just think of me 
You're probably nowhere near 23 
Believe me when I say that you'll be fine 
Cause you're probably doing better than me 
You're probably doing better than me 
You're probably doing better than me 
You're probably doing better than me
