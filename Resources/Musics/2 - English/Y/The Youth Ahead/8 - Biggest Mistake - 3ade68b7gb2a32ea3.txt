BIGGEST MISTAKE

Am I a creep 
Or am I just falling in love 
With you again 

Cause your eyes tell me 
That it's so far from over 
And I just can't sleep 
Thinking of everything right with us 
When only one thing that was pulling us apart 

So close but then 
We were always so far apart 
What's on your mind? 

Cause my heart tells me 
That we should be this close forever 
But my mind can't read 
Everything that's going on 
Going on inside your head 

I don't wanna walk away 
Cause I've messed up love before 
I'm sorry... 

Am I a creep 
Or am I just falling in love 
With you again 

Cause your eyes tell me 
That it's so far from over 
And I just can't sleep 
Thinking of everything right with us 
When only one thing that was pulling us apart
