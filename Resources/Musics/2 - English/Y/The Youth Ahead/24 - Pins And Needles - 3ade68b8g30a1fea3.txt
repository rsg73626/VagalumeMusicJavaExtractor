PINS AND NEEDLES

crying out for someone who's not there
help me I'm tired of pulling out my hair
and I'm wasted but I haven't got a beer
but if I'm such a nice guy well then I guess this isn't fair

cause I'm running out of patience, time, and energy
where is my life beginning to take me?
no one understands me and that's fine
I'd rather be alone so fuck off!

standing in a room with 8 foot walls
I'm climbing but when I reach the top I fall
I'm out of breath, out of time, dead last on the line
and I'm searching for a dream that should be mine

cause I'm running out patience, time, and energy
where is my life beginning to take me?
no one understands me and that's fine
I'd rather be alone so fuck off!

It's hard to follow your heart when you're all alone
impossible to play your part when the scripts unknown 
I heard today it might all go away
if you would just listen to what I have to say

and I'm wasted but I haven't got a beer

cause I'm running out of patience, time, and energy
where is my life beginning to take me?
no one understands me and that's fine
I'd rather be alone...
