HAS ANYONE SEEN MY UNDERWEAR?

Woke up, flat faced, on a kitchen floor.
With an empty bottle of JD still in my hand.
My headache was intense, there was a sudden chill in the air.
But the biggest shock was yet to come,
I was missing my underwear.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?

I looked up and down, and all around.
People stopped to stare.
I asked everyone about it, but no one really seemed to care.
It's just not fair.
What a nightmare.
I wish I had a spare, but I don't.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?

What could they have done with it?
I hear them all, they're laughing.
Hiding myself in the dark.
I hope nobody saw the skidmarks.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?

I was about to give up.
I was about to go home.
When I saw my pair of BVD's lying there on the floor.
I knew that they were mine.
I saw that they were fine.
But I was still drunk and naked.
Everybody laughed, and everybody screamed.

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?

Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?
Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?

Where did it go...
