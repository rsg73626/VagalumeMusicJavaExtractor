ONE HIT SONG

This song has absolutely no point about it 
I'm not even gonna probably make sense 
When I write it 
Some lines won't rhyme 
It won't tell a story 
I gotta put my pencil down 
Cause this has gotta be the dumbest song in history 

It has no hook 
It has no rhyme 
What a stupid waste of time 
Funny thing is 
This will probably be my one hit song 
It's hard to say or to relate 
To this boring life of mine 
That is why this will probably be my one hit song 

I'm not gonna sing about my song writing depression 
I'm just gonna play out this simple chord progression 
I'll steal a melody line 
Something stuck in my head 
Maybe na na na na na... 
Oh wait, I think that's mine 

It has no hook 
It has no rhyme 
What a stupid waste of time 
Funny thing is 
This will probably be my one hit song 
It's hard to say or to relate 
To this boring life of mine 
That is why this will probably be my one hit song 

GO! 

1, 2, 3, 4... 

It has no hook 
It has no rhyme 
What a stupid waste of time 
Funny thing is 
This will probably be my one hit song 
It's hard to say or to relate 
To this boring life of mine 
That is why this will probably be my one hit song 
My one hit song 
My one hit song 

1, 2, 3, 4 
STOP!
