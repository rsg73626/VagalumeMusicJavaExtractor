IT'S ONLY YOU

Maybe it's the way that you look at me
Makes me feel the way that I do
maybe its your laugh 
or the way that you talk
or as simple as the way that you walk
i know its hard to explain but when I'm with you
the sun seems to clear all the rain
its only you that could do this to me

Whenever I kiss you I get all dizzy
I get this feeling down inside
cuz then i know that your the only one that i wanna be with 
your the only one I want
and every night when i go to sleep
i know ill see you in my dreams
cuz all the time you'll be always on my mind

could it be your smile that'll bring me up when im feeling down
It's only you that will make me feel alright
It's only you
It's only you

I lost the love once before
a missing place in my heart
I couldnt take it anymore
all this hurt i felt inside backed up in my soul
it was getting so hard to hide
then you came along you took the gray from my life
you let me know without saying a word that things.. 
things would be alright
things would be alright

could it be your smile that could bring me up when im feelign down
It's only you that could make me feel alright
It's only you
It's only you
