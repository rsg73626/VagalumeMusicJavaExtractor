FAST TIMES

I can still smell the summer air
walking to the park, to the place where I grew up
humid nights, ridiculous fights
over girls that we just met
rollerblading everywhere, didn't care about too much
take me back to 1993

being young, having fun, overcome by everyone
real life's got me down today

16 and didn't care much
about what we did or who we were
just took it all how it always came
big fight, tonight
we'll dress in black to run away
behind the school we spent our days

what do you wanna do tonight
how can we still a case of beer from the backyard
it's collection night, that's right
so we're all gonna get paid
party in the woods seems appropriate enough let's start the fire
let it burn til the sun comes up

being young, having fun, overcome by everyone
real life's got me down today

16 and didn't care much
about what we did or who we were
just took it all how it always came
big fight, tonight
we'll dress in black to run away
behind the school we spent our days

whoa....

we'll talk all through the night and thing's will
they'll never be the same again
as they were back in 1993
they fade away

16 and didn't care much
about what we did or who we were
just took it all how it always came
big fight, tonight
we'll dress in black to run away
behind the school we spent our days

our days,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
