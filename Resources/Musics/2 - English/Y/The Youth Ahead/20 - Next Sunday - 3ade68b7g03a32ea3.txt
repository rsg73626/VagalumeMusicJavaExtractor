NEXT SUNDAY

The sunbeam shines through my window 
Reflects a picture of me and you 
So happily that no one could ever know 

Paper dolls and magazines 
Baby pictures and movie scenes 
There's so many things that remind me of you 

Little blonde girls playing hopscotch 
Across from my street 
At their bus stop 
I bet those are the things that you used to do 

And as I sit back and watch tv 
Every program has a silly scene 
That I just can't escape thinking of you 

There are those things that I can live without 
But it doesn't phase me 
I just block it out 
You're the one I know for sure 
You're the one I've been searching for 
And after all is said and done 
I'll see you at my door 

Summer hangouts 
The days we had 
Sunday movies were not that bad 
To make up for the time that I missed you 

And I'll wait up by the phone for you 
To call me back after I called you 
But it seems sometimes I'll be waiting here forever 

If I know you 
You said you know me 
Because it all adds up like we're on tv 
Because it's good at first 
But then you run out of ideas 

And the truth only hurts 
When you're too proud to say it first 
But by then I already feel like it's too late 

There are those things that I can live without 
But it doesn't phase me 
I just block it out 
You're the one I know for sure 
You're the one I've been searching for 
And after all is said and done 
I'll see you at my door 
At my door 

I guess I can only see you next Sunday 
I guess I can only see you next Sunday 
I guess I can only see you next Sunday 
I guess I can only see you next Sunday
