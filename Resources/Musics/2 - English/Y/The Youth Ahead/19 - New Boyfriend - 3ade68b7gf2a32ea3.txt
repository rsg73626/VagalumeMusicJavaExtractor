NEW BOYFRIEND

Just last week you dumped 
Now I'm driving past your house 
Wondering if you are at home 
But all the lights were out 
I'll sit outside your window 
I'll stare at you inside 
I see you with some chump 
I can't believe you're with another guy 

Your new boyfriend sucks, 
He's not what you need. 
Your new boyfriend sucks, 
You're better off with me. 

How could you forget me 
How can you walk away 
After all I've done for you 
Up to this day? 
I sent you a dozen roses 
Every anniversary 
And now I'm playng with myself 
I'm running out of liquid soap
