AREA 69

It was a dark and dreary night 
That a spaceship landed right in my backyard 
It shook my room and woke me up 
From a deep sleep 
From a cool dream 
Something bright, a yellow light 
Like a moonbeam 
So I stood up 
I went to the window 
Where I saw a pretty yellow light 
What a sight, what a fright to see 
An alien looking straight up at me 
Does he want to hurt me? 
Does he only want my family? 
Should I offer him a kudo? 
Or should I just go say hello? 
Should I just go say hello... 

I walked out my backdoor 
Up to it and stuck my hand 
Right in the air with fear 
But I said to it 
"Hello and how are you?" 
Well then it turned to me 
And I could see 
That this alien was surely not a he 
And so I said, "I come in peace" 
She said, "Please make love to me" 
Who am I to complain? 
I don't even have to ever know her name 
Could my girlfriend ever know 
That I screwed a UFO 
That I screwed a UFO 

I should have known right from the start 
That this E.T. bitch was to break my heart 
She had her own way 
She sucked me into her game 
She might as well just be a normal girl 
She smiled and waved 
And took off back to the milky way 
To the milky way 
To the milky way 
To the milky way 
Yeah, ohhh
