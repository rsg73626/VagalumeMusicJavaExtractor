VIRGINIA'S FOR LOVERS

Some people think that they got it all
all they need is themselves and they'll never fall
but I'm here and you're there and you'll never see
what inside, inside me, what's been killing me
I guess you don't care anyway....

If it's alright with you I think I should just walk away
cause you hate that, but it makes my day

so you're thinking everything could be
you're wishing everything could be
you're hoping everything could be fine, fine, fine
but it's not, NO!
no it's not
so you're thinking everything could be
you're wishing everything could be
you're hoping everything could be fine, fine, fine
but it's not, NO!
no it's not
and I guess you don't care anyway....

If it's alright with you I think I should just walk away
cause you hate that, but it makes my day

yeah, but it makes my day
GO!

and I guess you don't care anyway...

If it's alright with you I think I should just walk away
cause you hate that, but it makes my day

but it makes my day, YEAH!
