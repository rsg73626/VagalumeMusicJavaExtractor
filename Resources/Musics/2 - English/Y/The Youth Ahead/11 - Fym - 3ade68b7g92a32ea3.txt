FYM

na na na...
sometimes things seem totally wiped out
i bite my lip and clench my fist so tight
that i cant even feel it
my pulse is ready to explode
but why should i keep it under control
why should i just let it be
you see your startin to piss me off
so get the fuck away from me
just give me a reason
your pushin me too far
cuz all i ever wanna do
is to sit alone and sing my song
it goes na na na...
its what i do to keep the tension down
even tho it might seem a little gay
i dont care it calms me down
and sometimes i would make it through the day
ya say u gotta be crazy
but how can u be sure if u never tried
its not about communication
its about what i know is right
you'll never understand it
your narrow mind cant see
but if u feel there's no way out
then sing along
just sing along with me
na na na...

na na na...
