23 DAYS

I knew that something was wrong that day
I felt so empty inside with a burning sensation and pain
I wasn't myself, I couldn't react
to a situation or an attack
so please forgive me for leading you to believe
that all was well and fine that day
you wanted the story so here's how it goes
but first I just want you to know

that's its been 23 days since I last saw you
23 days since you fell out of my life
I feel this pain, and I'll go insane
if this lasts forever

so on with the story but it's not much
just an explanation for breaking your trust
maybe now I regret this, I just thought it'd be different
cause I just wanted to be free
you think that I lied even though that I tried
I never meant to hurt you on purpose
I gave up on her another gave up on me
and this is leading me to believe
that this idea is failing

23 days since I last saw you
23 days since you fell out of my life
I feel this pain and I'll go insane
if this lasts forever

so now you know I didn't simply erase you
and all we had til the end 
but that doesn't change the way I feel now
the way I feel now

23 days since I last saw you
23 days since you fell out of my life
I feel this pain and I'll go insane
if this lasts forever

will I ever get this right, and if this lasts forever
