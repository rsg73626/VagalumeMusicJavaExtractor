THE UNIVERSE WAS OURS

thanks for calling me last night, it's good to hear from you again
the only problem is it makes me think and now it's in my head
that we started something special long ago
and it never seemed to end, just stop and now I wonder if you know
that I miss you

do you remember all the things that we did
like going to shows and just being kids
staying up to drink all night
or writing I love you on my hand
sometimes we'd just sit in the parking lot and stare
and tell each others with no one else we'd share

so tell me did you sleep last night, cause when I turned off all the lights
it's like a sudden rush of pain for me cause now I see
I'm all alone without you here I guess there's nothing left to do
so give me one good reason why I shouldn't sing this song to you
that I miss you

do you remember sitting under the stars
on looking up the universe was ours
spent the night caught in my arms
and I swore I wouldn't leave until you slept
but even now I don't think I could ever let you go
because you made this movie perfect when it just goes to show

let's go!

and as I stare at the sky, I sit and I wonder are you thinking of me tonight
and when I stare at the sky, I sit and I wonder are you thinking of me tonight
and when I stare at the sky, I sit and I wonder are you thinking of me tonight

do you remember sitting under the stars
on looking up the universe was ours
spent the night caught in my arms
and I swore I wouldn't leave until you slept
but even now I don't think I could ever let you go
because you made this movie perfect when it just goes to show
