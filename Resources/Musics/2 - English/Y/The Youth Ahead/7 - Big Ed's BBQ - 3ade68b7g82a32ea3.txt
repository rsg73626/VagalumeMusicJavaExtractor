BIG ED'S BBQ

its time tonight to go down to
the greatest restaurant in the world
where forks are useless
gimmie, gimmie, meaty goodness on a plate
and keep it hot maybe with a baked potato
come on baby let me fill your belly
with a porky pig dipped in special marinade
keep it coming, keep it coming
every ten mintues or so
till I cant stand up
cause no one could ever make a pig
into the greatest all you can eat ribs...only at

Big Eds! <i>[x4]

they'll try to fill you with the salad, but you gotta just say NO!
it'll make less room for that
super meaty, goodie, goodie, finger licking piggie love
got no room for chicken
lets build a rib tower higher then we did before
we got plenty of wet naps
oh so damn good that your friend wanna lick your hands
I tell no lie cause there aint no doubt when duty calls
that Big Ed's BBQ will crush em' all!...say it now!
