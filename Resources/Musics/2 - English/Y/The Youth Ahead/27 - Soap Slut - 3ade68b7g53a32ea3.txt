SOAP SLUT

Sometimes its scented or colored
Its located on your bathroom sink
Or In the shower on a rope
It takes away the stink
Well it does a little more then that

It doesnt talk back to you
It doesnt have any feelings
It wont take your money
Or make you call it honey
Its the Soap Slut

Soap Slut You're the one for me
In the morning I just cant wait to see you
Deoderize me and bring me back to ectasy
My soap slut ive never been so clean

So, if you're feeling down or depressed
There's only one place you gotta go
That's into the shower
Cause the Soap's got the power
But dont forget to lock the door

It can't say you came too quick
Or say you treat me like shit
It cant cry or whine or look at other guys
Its the Soap Slut

Soap Slut You're the one for me
In the morning I just cant wait to see you
Deoderize me and bring me back to ectasy
My soap slut ive never been so clean

I'm going blind just thinkin about you
Cause you make me feel so good
And im wondering why Theres a tear in my eye
When i see that you've broken in two

But thats alright Take a trip to ShopRite
And buy me a couple more
Stock 'em under the sink
Up and Down the closet door
That's the best about having a Soap Whore

It can't say you came too quick
Or say you treat me like shit
It cant cry or whine or look at other guys
Its the Soap Slut

Soap Slut You're the one for me
In the morning I just cant wait to see you
Deoderize me and bring me back to ectasy
My soap slut ive never been so clean
