BEAUTIFUL DAY

it's a beautiful day
the sun is so bright
with the wind blowin gently through the baby blue sky
i know i've seen this day before
and i'm sure
i'll probably see it again

it's a beautiful day
it might as well rain
cuz i'm stuck in this shitty dead end job again
i know i've said this line before
and im sure
i'll probably say it again
it's alright
it's ok
it's alright but it's still just a beautiful day
it's alright
it's ok
it's alright but it's still just a beautiful day
it's a beautiful day
might as well be my last
cuz the girl of my dreams just broke my heart in half
i know i went through this before
and i'm sure
i'll go through it again
it's alright
it's ok
it's alright but it's still just a beautiful day
it's alright
it's ok
it's alright but it's still just a beautiful day
day yea
day yea
it's still a beautiful day
day yea
day yea

i know it's sad
but we all cry
we all lie, and we all die
but it's what's
in our heart
that'll make
us go on
so put me down
and seal my fate
brand me all you want just don't stand in my way
cuz it's still just a beautiful day
a beautiful day

i know it's sad
but we all cry
we all lie, and we all die
but it's what's
in our heart
that'll make
us go on
so put me down
and seal my fate
brand me all you want just don't stand in my way
cuz it's still just a beautiful day
