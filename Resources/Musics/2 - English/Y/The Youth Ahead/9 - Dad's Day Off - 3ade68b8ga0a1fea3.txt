DAD'S DAY OFF

something weird is going on, throughout this entire town
I'm packing up my mini van, cause shit's about to hit the fan
people are talking, and someone is stalking me
and in the backyard I can see a light running constantly

and an hour ago my mom told me to take her for a beer
the blue turned blue, and my dad gave me money to buy a new tattoo

everything's upside down and inside out
turn back around cause my neck is all twisted up
am I wrong to say
that something ain't right, cause it's sunny at night
and the dog's in the front yard selling pink lemonade
am I wrong to say what's up with today

gotta find a reason why, people keep flying by
try to run a little faster now, but my feet are glued to the ground
and my iguana just told me, that he worries about me
he said you've been acting kinda weird and then he drank all of my beer

and I went home to my girlfriend she was speaking japanese
the cat's on my back, and the t.v.'s on crack and the floor was made of cheese

everything's upside down and inside out
turn back around cause my neck is all twisted up
am I wrong to say
that something ain't right, cause it's sunny at night
and the dog's in the front yard selling pink lemonade
am I wrong to say what's up with today

my alarm clock rings I guess it was all just a dream
but now I'm sleeping in my swimming pool
did you ever have a day where nothing seems to go your way
it could be worse, you're not the last but you're not the first
