ODE TO THE DOLLAR

It's a Tuesday night,
I'm sitting in my room all alone
'Til I pick up the phone, and call my friends.
I call Jay, he calls Mike,
We all know what we wanna do tonight.
It feels so right.

There's only one place where men can be men,
Where you're not happy unless your paycheck is spent,
So leave your girlfriends at home and follow me,
To heaven on Earth.

Oh, you'll say we gotta GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
We gotta GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!

The ice tea is sweet,
It 's too bad that we can't get a seat on the dance floor.
There's a girl that's looking pretty nice to me,
I hope she'll come bounce on my knee,
When she's done with that other guy.

It doesn't matter if your handsome or not,
So call up every guy on every city block,
To come on down and spend a buck or two,
We'll see what they can do.

When we GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
We gotta GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!

It doesn't matter if your handsome or not,
So call up every guy on every city block,
To come on down and spend a buck or two,
We'll see what they can do.

When we GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
We gotta GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
GO GO! to the nudie bar!
