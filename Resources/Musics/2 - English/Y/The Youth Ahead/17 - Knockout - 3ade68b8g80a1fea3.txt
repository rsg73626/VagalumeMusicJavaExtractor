KNOCKOUT

I gotta tell you about my new love
should I mention that my girlfriend is in love with her too
she'll stay up all night, and party all night
and when she's lit everyone in the room knows what she's gonna do next

she'll make your grey sky blue
she'll do your friends and she'll do you too
girls or guys any kind
take your time cause she doesn't mind

she doesn't mind, yeah!

she got the sweet smell that attracts me
she says so much when she never even utters a word
the parties packed in, it's time to hit it
she makes her point as you take in what she says
it's about to make sense

she'll make your grey sky blue
she'll do your friends and she'll do you too
girls or guys any kind
take your time cause she doesn't mind

and when she runs out she'll always come back
there's always plenty of her to go around
so slow down, and relax
and just let go

GO!

slow down, and relax cause life is too short
you gotta take in what makes ya feel good

and make your grey sky blue
she'll do your friends and she'll do you too
girls or guys, any kind
take your time cause she doesn't mind

she'll make your grey sky blue
she'll do your friends and she'll do you too
girls or guys any kind
take your time cause she doesn't mind
<i>[x2]</i>
she doesn't mind
