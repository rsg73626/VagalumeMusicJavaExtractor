PASSIONFRUIT

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Plans in my soul of addiction for now
'cause I'm fallin' apart
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'cause we're fallin' apart

Listen
Hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doin' that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you no, no

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you no, no
