THE DECISION

I wore the blue with the green 
I wore the blue with the green 
I mixed the matt with the sheen, 
It`s not the way to be seen 
That decision was mine, 
well that decision was mine 
I was a difficult child 
I was a difficult child 
I was abstract and wild 
I played the dane with a smile 
That decision was mine 
that decision was mine 
that decision was mine, well 
that decision was mine 

The horses in the new forest, 
are running in their Sunday best 
And though you can?t believe your ears 
They say the words you long to hear 

It`s easier, It`s easier 

I`m the prince of wales 
I`m that prince of wales 
And if all else fails 
I am the prince of wales 
That decision was mine, 
that decision was mine 
I`m your monarch 
I am your monarch 
I`m your monarch, 
supreme monarch 
That decision was mine, 
that decision was mine 
That decision was mine, 
well that decision was mine 


The horses in the new forest, 
are running in their Sunday best 
And though you can?t believe your ears 
They say the words you long to hear 

It`s easier, It`s easier 

That decision was mine, 
that decision was mine 
That decision was mine, 
well that decision was mine
