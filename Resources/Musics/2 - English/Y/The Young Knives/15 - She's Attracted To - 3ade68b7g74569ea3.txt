SHE'S ATTRACTED TO

Who are these people? 
They are too stupid to be your real parents! 
I've met some bone idles in my time 
But they really take the biscuit. 

I tried to make talk to them nice. 
I wanted them to like me, yeah! 
But as time went by and the look in their eyes 
Said it's never gonna do the trick! 

She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 

She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 

Your dad cornered me in the hallway 
While you were in the loo. 
He gave me a right talking to, 
He said I was a terrorist! 

Reason I tried, but when reason she died 
We were fighting on the drive 
Under the security lights... 
And you're mum was screaming! 

She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 

She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 

La la la la la la la, 
La la la la la la la, 
La la la la la la la, 
La la la la laa la laa! 

When you finally joined the party 
You took MY side. 
Then the whole street knew what was happening outside. 

You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
Well you were screaming at your mum, 
I was punching your dad! 

You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad! 

You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
You were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 
Well you were screaming at your mum, 
And I was punching your dad. 

In his face! 
I hate you! 

She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 

She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to.. 
She's attracted to..
