TAILORS

Tailors are the best 
See them running with their brollies 
Workmen of the week 

Sew my buttons on 
There’s no rushing perfection 
Workmen of the week 

Button, Button, Button 
Needle, Needle, Needle 
Cotton, Cotton, Cotton 

Work the wordless week 
There’s no drudgery in detail 
Maker of the neat 

Tailors are the best 
And Tailors get you dressed 
Tailors are the best 

Like their ancestors 
They are people of great passion 
Maker of the neat 

Sewing 
Sewing 
Sewing 
Sewing
