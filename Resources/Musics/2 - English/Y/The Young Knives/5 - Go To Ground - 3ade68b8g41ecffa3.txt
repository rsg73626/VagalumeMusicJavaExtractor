GO TO GROUND

The lips you kiss
As sharp as glass
They bring a tear
So swallow back until
Your features dissapear
And what do you get
Well what you'll get
Are cauliflower ears
And scars

And if we don't go to ground
Together we may drown (x4)

I hadn't noticed
But you need a lick of paint
You're lost a tarnish by the storm
Your colour fades
And everyone knows
That nobody wins a stalemate
So press pause
Press pause

And if we don't go to ground
Together we may drown (x4)

And if we don't go to ground
Together we may drown (x4)
