HUMAN AGAIN

Can you play your part?
Did you come alive in the dark?
Did you say just a little bit more?

Where the day-glo ends
There's another one around the bend
Who you play just a little bit more

Breakneck, breakneck, it's plain to see
Your long legs are a fantasy
Your big old fish a fallacy
You had just a little bit more...

That seeds are for sowing
And the lights are low and nothing here
And time isn't moving
So the fast goes fast
And the slow goes slow
In the morning you will feel
Human again

Did you fill your glass?
Did you open up in the park?
Did you say just a little bit more?

Where the rainbow ends
There's another thrill another friend
Who can pay just a little bit more...

Upset, upset the harmony
Your wicked words are killing me
You're pulling every part of me
Just a little bit more

But weeds are for hoeing
And the sights are low and nothing here
And time isn't moving
So the fast goes fast
And the slow goes slow
In the morning you will feel
Human again

Can you play your part?
Did you come alive in the dark?
Did you say just a little bit more?
Where the rainbow ends,
There's another thrill another friend
Who can pay just a little bit more

You're killing every part of me
You're killing every part of me

So the fast goes fast
And the slow goes slow
In the morning you will feel
Human again

Grips may slip
And your bridges may bough
In the morning you will feel
Human again

Throw your bones up against the wall
In the morning you will feel
Human again

Lose yourself
In the eye of the storm
In the morning you will feel
Human again
Human again
