SISTER FRIDESWIDE

Dear, sister frideswide
She's got some problems
Dear, sister frideswide
She fell in love with
The boys from the town
The boys from the town
The boys from the town

They keep calling
Dear, sister frideswide
She tries to ignore them
But they make her feel wanted
And she's torn between them and
The voice from the clouds
The voice from the clouds
The voice from the clouds

It's a calling
It's a calling

And she knows she should not be lonely
But she's lonely
Oh, yes she is
And she knows that he'll always be there
Oh he'll be there
When she gets down on her knees

Dear, sister frideswide
She's got some yearning
Dear, sister fridewide
And it's burning a hole
In the back of her mind
The back of her mind
The back of her mind
In the back of her mind
Keep it deep down inside
In the back of your mind
They keep calling

Oh...

And she knows she should not be lonely
But she's lonely
Oh, yes she is
And she knows that he'll always be there
Oh he'll be there
When she gets down on her knees

Oh...

Keep calling
Calling, calling, calling
In the back of her mind
In the back of her mind
In the back of her mind

It's still burning, burning
Sister fridewide, frideswide, frideswide
She's been yearning
They keep calling

Oh...sister frideswide
