EVERYTHING FALLS INTO PLACE

The cheque has bounced, again
The wolves are at, my door
And the injuries that I sustained
Have rid their ugly heads again
And I strain an ear
For your sweet words
They soften off my pain

And everything falls into place
(x3)
Again

The smash of breaking glass
Soundtracks my day today
And paperwork is piling up
And in the castle flies amock

And everything falls into place
(x3)

And in the end, and in the end, everything will turn out alright
(x2)

And everything falls into place
And so bravery falls to the cowards
And mystery comes from the mundane
And nothing should fall by the wayside
And no one should live in a lay-by

And everything falls into place
(x2)
