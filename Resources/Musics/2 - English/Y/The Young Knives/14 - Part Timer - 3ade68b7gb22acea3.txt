PART TIMER

I had a day to work on a song 
I flicked it up and down with my thumbs 
The day had gone I hadn't begun 
I was bored I was bored 

Ooh Part time forever under the weather 
Ooh, take it or leave it better believe it 
I was bored 

I'm not one to be at a loose end 
But I found it hard to pick up the pen 
Tomorrow I will try it again 
With the sword, with the sword 

Ooh Part time forever under the weather 
Ooh, take it or leave it better believe it 

Back down itâ€™s the best you can hope for 
Back down again (x6) 

Down down down, d, down, d, down, down down down down (x4) 

And everything stays the same (x8) 

Ooh, Part time forever under the weather 
Ooh Take it or leave it 
Part time, Part time
