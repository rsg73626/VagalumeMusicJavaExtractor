IN THE PINK

Constant winning 
Left him wanting 
No point choosing 
They chose for him 
All the faces 
All the faces 
Blanked out faces 
Blanked out faces 

In the Pink (x 4) 

Cut out faces 
From the papers 
Made a collage 
Dead Peoples faces 
Dead Peoples faces 
Dead Peoples faces 
Made a collage 
Dead Peoples faces 

In the Pink (x4) 

Can’t help feeling 
Something’s missing 
He cannot fail 
He cannot loose 
A fascination 
With blanked out faces 
How does it feel? 

In the Pink (x8) 

He cannot fail 
He cannot loose 
He cannot fight
