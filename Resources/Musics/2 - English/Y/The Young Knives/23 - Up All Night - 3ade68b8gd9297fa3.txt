UP ALL NIGHT

I  got dressed up
up to the nines
i took a look in the mirror
i wish i was thinner then everythinng would be fine
at least i smell nice
so come on and breathe me in
whats the point?

cause everybody looks famous
and they've been wasting lots of time 
everybody feels special tonight

its a show down and its down to the wire
the faces so warm so pale and drawn
the last ones to retire
and if no one can manage a smile
well whats the point?

cause everybody looks famous
and they've been wasting lots of time 
everybody is special in their minds eye
oh...

Night, up all night....
We are sleeping we are staying up all night
Up all night...
We are sleeping we are staying up all night
Up all night...

rock bottom, rock bottom 
you've hit rock bottom

cause everybody looks famous
and they've been wasting lots of time 
everybody is special in their minds eye
oh...
everybody feels special tonight

up all night
we are sleeping we are staying up all night
