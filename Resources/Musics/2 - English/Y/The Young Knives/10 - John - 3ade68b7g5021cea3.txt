JOHN

Who is the naughtiest child? 
Who drives their French teacher wild? 
And when he's telling you lies 
He looks you straight in the eye 

Got kicked in the side 
In the side, it's the same again 
Got kicked in the hide 
Must be then, it was now and then 

He's got the social disease 
J-J-J-John! 
Grass stains and cuts on his knees 
J-J-J-John! 
He won't listen to a word that you say 
J-J-J-John! 
He'll steal your daughters away 

Got kicked in the side 
In the side, it's the same again 
Got kicked in the hide 
Must be then, it was now and then 

You took him home to meet your queen 
You know you didn't want to, know you didn't want to 
And lent him all your good CDs 
You know you didn't want to, know you didn't want to 
You said you were the only one 
You know you didn't want to, know you didn't want to 
They broke the mould for dear old John 
You know you didn't want to, know you didn't want to 

Got kicked in the side 
In the side, it's the same again 
Got kicked in the hide 
Must be then, it was now and then 

J-J-J-J-John 
J-J-J-J-John
