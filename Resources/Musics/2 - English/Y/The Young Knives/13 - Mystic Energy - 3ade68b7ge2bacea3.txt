MYSTIC ENERGY

When they brought me down 
They stuck me through a curtain powered by a motor 
Then they said some nice words 
I think I recognize them from the last time I was here 
I saw it in your eyes 
You thought I couldn't know 
So now they stick me six feet under 
Make sure itâ€™s at Home 

Cherie my heart sings 
Bury me darling 

I feel a mystic energy 
I feel it coming over me 
And now they say it's time for me 
I feel a mystic energy 

Now my time has come 
You know that I must go 
Yes we do know 
Well there's no one I want to see here 
So can you take me home 

Cherie my heart sings 
Bury me darling 

I feel a mystic energy 
I feel it coming over me 
And now they say its time for me 
I feel a mystic energy 
Oh 
He's dead 
She said 
He's dead 

I feel it coming over me 
And now they say its time for me 
I feel a mystic energy 
Oh 
He's dead 
She said 
He's dead
