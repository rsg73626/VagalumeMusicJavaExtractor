TURN TAIL

These are my hands
These are brick walls
Men can break down brick walls (2x)
These are my hands
These are brick walls
Men can break down brick walls (2x)

Where are the spoils?
Where are the treats?
I’ve been worked to the bone
I’ve been worked off my feet
Head in my hands
Hands in the soil
I’ve been cheated and stripped of my perfect retreat

We’re all slaves on this ship (2x)
This ship’s sinking
We will not reach the shore (2x)
Reach the shore

My back is sore
So I sleep on the floor
With the dust and the leaves
That blew under the door
These are my chores (2x)
I must not show the strain

We’re all slaves on this ship (2x)
This ship’s sinking
We will not reach the shore (2x)
Reach the shore
This ship’s sinking (3x)

Turn tail and run
Turn tail and run
I will turn tail and run
I will turn tail and run
(repeat till 4 times)

Swim to the coast, boat full of ghosts
Jump from the prow, jump from the prow
Swim to the coast, boat full of ghosts
Jump from the prow, jump from the prow (5x)

Turn tail and run (2x)
I will turn tail and run (2x)
Turn tail and run (2x)
I will turn tail and run (2x)

We’re all slaves on this ship (2x)
This ship’s sinking
We will not reach the shore (2x)
Reach the shore
This ship’s sinking (3x)

Turn tail and run (2x)
I will turn tail and run (2x)
