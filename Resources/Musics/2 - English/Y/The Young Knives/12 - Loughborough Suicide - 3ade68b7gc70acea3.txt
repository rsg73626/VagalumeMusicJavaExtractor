LOUGHBOROUGH SUICIDE

I looked down from the Carillon 
I looked across to the aviary 
How long have they been having fun? 

I want to be among them 
Sitting pretty drinking Evian 
I don’t think that it will be long 

And I will never go down fighting (x4) 

I want to do it on the tennis courts 
I want to do it where they are playing sport 
So they can make sport of this man 
Will I find myself traveling? 
Will I find myself in therapy? 
Or leap and just see where I land 

And I will never go down fighting (x4) 

Well it is cold, cold, cold 
And I think I’m going to die in here 
Considering Loughborough suicide 
Which I’m definitely going to do this year 
And if you take a look out side 
Then the answers to your questions seem quite clear 
That you may as well leave 
Because there’s nothing else to do around here 

How long have I been inside? (x8) 

Well it is cold, cold, cold 
And I think I’m going to die in here 
Considering Loughborough suicide 
Which I’m definitely going to do this year 
And if you take a look out side 
Then the answers to your questions seem quite clear 
That you may as well leave 
Because there’s nothing else to do around here (x2) 

And I will never go down fighting (x4)
