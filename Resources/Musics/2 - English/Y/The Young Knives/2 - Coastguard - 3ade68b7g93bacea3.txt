COASTGUARD

Coastguard are you familiar 
High tides are not peculiar 
And on the table is a yellow coat 
And on the table is a yellow coat 

Mummy tries 
Bye bye 
Mummy tries 
Bye bye 

Think back what were you doing then 
Back turned and turned back again 
And on the table is your sorry face 
On the table is your sorry face 

Mummy tries 
Bye bye 
Mummy tries 
Bye bye 

Deep black and deep 
She takes the most 
Black deep and black 
She takes the most 
Deep black and deep 
She takes the most 
Black deep and black 
She takes the most 

Sit down it’s what you always do 
Talk loud who are you talking to 
And at the table is an empty place 
at the table is an empty place 

Mummy tries 
Bye bye 
Mummy tries 
Mummy tries 

These are the pearls that were her eyes 
She’s flotsam carried on the tides 
Is she lost or did she hide? 
On shifting rocks 
On shifting rocks 

She couldn’t swim she couldn’t see 
The current pushing out the sea 
Down estuaries and tributaries 
On benthic rocks 
She’s wrecked on Benthic rocks 

She’s been swept away (x4)
