ANOTHER HOLLOW LINE

A lonely smile in the clouds 
And the smell of foreign bodies 
He waits for you to ask him out 
Three hours sitting in the lobby 
It’s another Hollow line 
From a wooden body 
And you know you love him 
Because you know he loves you 

Hollow line 
Waste of time 
Hollow line 
Just another Hollow Line 

I heard you are getting into Zen 
And you’ve got a Buddhist friend 
I didn’t think you had the patience 
I guess you’ve proved me wrong again 

Who are you? 
Who are you? 

Hollow line 
Waste of time 
Hollow line 
Just another hollow line 

One day you’re sitting very still 
And repeating a faburden 
The next you’re wearing Faberge 
On your way to Covent garden 

Who are you? 
Who are you? 

Hollow line 
Waste of time 
Hollow line 
Waste of time 
Hollow line 
Waste of time 
Hollow line 
Just another hollow line
