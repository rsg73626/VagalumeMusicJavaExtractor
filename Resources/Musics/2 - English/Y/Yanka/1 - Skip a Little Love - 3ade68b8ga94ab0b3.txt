SKIP A LITTLE LOVE

I've been searching for ya in the heart of the earth
But like a windstorm blow you throw me to the stars

You skip a little love on my body and I burn
You skip a little love
You skip a little love on my body and I burn
You skip a little

And just hold me hold me hard 'til you're gone
Just hold me hold me hard 'til you're gone
Skip a little love on my body and I burn
Skip a little, skip a little

I've bee waiting for ya to rock my world
But like a wave to the shore you crush me with love

You skip a little love on my body and I burn
You skip a little love
You skip a little love on my body and I burn
You skip a little

And just hold me hold me hard 'til you're gone
Just hold me hold me hard 'til you're gone
Skip a little love on my body and I burn
Skip a little, skip a little

Feel my body when you come so close
I feel your body like an overdose

And just hold me hold me hard til you're gone
Just hold me hold me hard til you're gone
Skip a little love ob my body and I burn
Skip a little, skip a little

You skip a little love on my body and I burn
You skip a little
