THE LAST SONG

Time flies by, alone I'm nothing.
With out these guys I'm missing something
best friends for a life time, now were brothers
I know we'll survive, we've got each other

Finally, we sit here. Were still, best friends.
Finally the meaning, is so clear, were here.

Mark my words, the path is worth it
though all the time and all the moments
Were getting it right now, desires burning, wrong turns and red lights
at least were learning.

Finally, we sit here. Were still, best friends.
Finally the meaning, is so clear, were here.

These times, i wish they'd never end. Drive up to come home with a friend.
Take time to make this the best we can, Drive up to come home with a friend.
These times, i wish they'd never end. Drive up to come home with a friend.
Take time to make this the best we can, Drive up to come home with a friend.
