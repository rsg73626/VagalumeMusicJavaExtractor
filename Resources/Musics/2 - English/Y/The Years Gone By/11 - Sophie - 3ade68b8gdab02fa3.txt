SOPHIE

You mean the most to me
I guess it's obvious (it's obvious)
We fight a lot to make
The most of everything

I'm sure you won't let go with my hands in yours
I'm sure to drown without your lungs
Cause they fill me up
You fill me up

You know (you know)
That I could never be (I could never be)
Ice cold (ice cold)
Like you are to me and I know
You know (you know)
That I could never be (I could never be)
Ice cold (ice cold)
Like you are to me and I know

Don't believe the lies you read
When all the blames on me (it's all on me)
There's more to every story
And you know there's no ending

I'll show the heart you hold that you don't want to let go
I'm writing lines in this story to tell you how I want it to go

You know (you know)
That I could never be (I could never be)
Ice cold (ice cold)
Like you are to me and I know
You know (you know)
That I could never be (I could never be)
Ice cold (ice cold)
Like you are to me and I know
Yeah

(Whoa) Cause you're the only thing in my life worth living for
The only thing worth
I realize your eyes,. there not the only thing that gets me by...
