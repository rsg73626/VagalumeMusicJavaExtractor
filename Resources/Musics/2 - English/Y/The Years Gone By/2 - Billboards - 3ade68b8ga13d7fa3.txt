BILLBOARDS

I miss you more with every mile that we drive
and when i wake the suns not as bright as your eyes
i miss you more with every state that we cross
say you'll stay and waste another day

the pictures that we paint are better than what i saw today
i miss you, from one thousand miles away

and i got this figured out right
and i will fly home tonight oh
the east coast weather is so much better when its with you

cause theres so much left to drive
and i haven't slept in nights oh
i set my car on cruise control
this is where i begin to let go

i keep your photograph taped to my rear view
so when i look behind me all i see is you
i miss you more, but i no you got my back
say you'll stay, and waste another day here in new jersey

the long drives that we make
we're crossing over states its over rated
but i'm one thousand miles away

and i got this figured out right
and i will fly home tonight oh
the east coast weather is so much better when its with you

cause theres so much left to drive
and i haven't slept in nights
i set my car on cruise control
this is where i begin to let go

i miss with every mile that we drive.

and i got this figured out right
i will fly home tonight
the east coast weather is so much better when its with you

cause theres so much left to drive
and i haven't slept in nights
i set my car on cruise control
this is where i begin to let go
and this is where i begin to let go
and this is where i begin to let go
