YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE IN SPACE

I’m not a hopeless romantic.
 I’m just romantic yeah I’m very hopeless. 
I’m not a liar And If I never see you again And if I never find you again, in this world. 
I’ll remember what we both said. 
I remember what you said to me (you said) I’ll wait around for you to come around. A million hours back west. 
I’ll wait around. 
For you to come around.
 Wake me when im dreaming of you cuz it’s poinless To sleep all alone in my room It's cold here in Jersey And you barely know me And my heart wants to leave, so get up, get up and go. Break me when Im dreaming of you because I'm better off broken left alone in my room.
 It's cold here in jersey and you should come join me and my heart wants to leave.
 My heart can't move my feet. Friday is the night I go out and think of why I'm alone.
 You're on the other coast, you're on the other coast Four hours till work in the morning and were just getting started baby. I’ll wait around for you to come around. 
A million hours back west.
 I’ll wait around.
 For you to come around. 
 Wake me when im dreaming of you cuz it’s pointless To sleep all alone in my room You would love jersey You should come join me My heart wants to leave so get up, get up and go. Break me when Im dreaming of you because I'm better off broken left alone in my room.
 It's cold here in jersey and you should come join me and my heart wants to leave. 
My heart can't move my feet. I can't stop, thinking about those lonely roads that keep you away from me. I can't stop help but wonder what's next for this, and our first kiss, because I'm weak with out you here.
