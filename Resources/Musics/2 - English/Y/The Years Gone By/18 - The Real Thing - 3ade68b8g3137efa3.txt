THE REAL THING

The phone rings,
It's your voice.
You said how,
There's no choice.
You're too cool, and I tour too much
How could this work, we don't keep in touch.
With every line I write, I'm one closer to leaving
Forever was a joke, the joke was I believed it.
Alone, leave me alone.

Run.
Run from this world without me.
No streets left for us to sleep.
The doorstep where I'll leave my key.
I guess this is just goodbye...
Whoa, Run from this world without me.
Whoa, no streets left for us to sleep.
Whoa, The doorstep where I'll leave my key.
I guess this is just goodbye.

Would it hurt less if I
Learn how to deal with goodbye.
You're out late, and I never call,
What's left to say, smiles said it all.
My heart was so calloused,
I couldn't even feel it,
Your lies were so careless,
How could I have believed it? No.
Leave me alone.

Run.
Run from this world without me.
No streets left for us to sleep.
The doorstep where I'll leave my key.
I guess this is just goodbye...
Whoa, Run from this world without me.
Whoa, no streets left for us to sleep.
Whoa, The doorstep where I'll leave my key.
I guess this is just goodbye.

(Goodbye!)

Run. Run from this world without me.
No streets left for us to sleep.
The doorstep where I'll leave my key.
I guess this is just goodbye...
Whoa, Run from this world without me.
Whoa, no streets left for us to sleep.
Whoa, The doorstep where I'll leave my key.
I guess this is just goodbye
