HIGH SCHOOL SENSATION

High School Sensation

The city never sleeps whenever you are not around,
and I can feel the falling temperature
we've got to heat this town. (up again)
Over and over we see the things we've came to know
and yet i know i'll never get to get over you.
The colors aren't as bright when I am drowning in this lake,
lost in all the different shades of blues that this depression creates.
Make ups and let downs were only a few seconds away.
From destroying what we loved for so long
and now we throw it away.

All of this town screams your name, screams your name girl. (your name)
All of the songs sing the words that we've said.
All of this town screams your name screams your name girl. (your name)
And I don't want to go on
being just a high school sensation.

Forget everything you thought you've known since you were young
because when you're gone away from me, there's no sense in you holding on.
You were, my wake up call, now I miss those days we'd waste,
in your car with nothing but the lights on.
I gave you all of me.

All of this town screams your name, screams your name girl. (your name)
All of the songs sing the words that we've said.
All of this town screams your name screams your name girl. (your name)
And I don't want to go on
being just a high school sensation.

Say whoa, say whoa
you never know.

Make your words, mean more than the offer
and more than you meant it to show.
Make your worst insult and ill take it,
if it means I'm coming back home. (back home)

Say whoa, say whoa
you never know.

All of this town screams your name, screams your name girl. (your name)
All of the songs sing the words that we've said.
All of this town screams your name screams your name girl. (your name)
And I don't want to go on
being just a high school sensation
