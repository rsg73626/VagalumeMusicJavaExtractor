HIGHER EXPECTATIONS

Behind these walls
Im frozen in stone
Im gonna try to warm up to the fact im not perfect
My walls are up
Your not getting them down
Im want to try to turn this world around

I never said that this would be the easiest thing that i had to do
But every mistake that i made i never made because of you

You, you know that everythings not for you
And you dont have to give up
Youre the one whos got to grow on yourself
So put off all your doubts and your reservatons on the shelf

If im gonna try to impact on your lives
I have to try to find whats wrong afn fix
To the wrosts days of my lfie
If i could burn it from inside
And live the best that i can
Live the best that i can

I never said that this would be the easiest thing that i had to do
But every mistake that i made i never made because of you

You, you know that everythings not for you
And you dont have to give up
Youre the one whos got to grow on yourself
So put off all your doubts and your reservatons on the shelf

I cant stand myself when i make mistakes
So cold inside im about to bre eak eak
I cant live the life that you want me to live
Im gonna break out of my shell
Im gonna break free
