THEM 1, ME 0

She couldn't take it, she had the notion
That I was leaving on the first flight back home
Go back to Jersey, her friends would all say
It's better being home than being miserable anyway
Before we go off, I have to say this
I never broke my promise
You lacked in that department
How could I be wrong?
How long could this stand?
Your heart knows me better than you think you know all your friends

I know that you're sleeping
You're running away with him
And I won't wake you up till its over
And I know that you're sleeping
Dreaming of what you've been
And I won't wake you up cause its over

To fix the problem, you'd have to find it
Look to your friends, you'll find an answer bearing any substance
Match made in heaven, broke in the suburbs
I saw the future so I guess I know why it hurts

And what's worse, is you, would never have to play the games that you put me through
With high hopes, to lose, I'm better off dead than ever being next to you

I know that you're sleeping
You're running away with him
And I won't wake you up till its over
And I know that you're sleeping
Dreaming of what you've been
And I won't wake you up cause its over

What more could you want that you haven't taken?
(What more could you want?)
The rules that were made were the rules we were breaking
(Rules we're breaking)
So what more could you that you haven't taken
The rules that we're breaking, it's yours for the taking

I know that you're sleeping
You're running away with him
And I won't wake you up till its over
And I know that you're sleeping
Dreaming of what you've been
And I won't wake you up cause its over

I know that you're sleeping
I know that you're sleeping
I won't wake you up cause it's over
