ANNIVERSARY

You know me much better than anyone. er... Everyone, for that matter.
When i say I love you, you know the truth. When ill say I miss you,
baby you know that thats no lie.
Take it out of context, take it out of my head you know where you stand.

You never know where we go its incredible.
You never know where we go to be alone when...
You never know where we go to be incredible now...
be incredible now.

You know me and I'll state the obvious: Your the light, in my life.
When i say I need you (say i need you) You know the truth
because my hearts not whole when its not beating around you.
Take it out of context, take it out of my head you know where you stand.

You know me, much better than everyone. Everyone in my life.

You never know where we go its incredible.
You never know where we go to be alone when...
You never know where we go to be incredible now...
be incredible now.
