STAY CLOSE

The lights begin to dim and I've been
a wreck because I'm just so scared to lose
My greatest fear...
my worst condition.
I never mention.
how I...
I haven't slept in weeks. I lie awake
because I fear the time it takes.. to. say. goodbye

I don't ever want to wake up without you by my side.
I don't ever want to have to fill those shoes.
I'll just hope you stay close to me.

I've lived, I've lost, but learned, I haven't.
found how to cope and break my habits.
My greatest fear, my worst condition
I never mention
How The house begins to speak and I can't
listen to the things I need to
Save me from my own life.
(please done leave me one more time. please don't leave me one more.)

I don't ever want to wake up without you by my side.
I don't ever want to have to fill those shoes.
I'll just hope you stay close to me.
I don't ever want to wake up with out you, by my side
I'll just hope you stay close to me.
