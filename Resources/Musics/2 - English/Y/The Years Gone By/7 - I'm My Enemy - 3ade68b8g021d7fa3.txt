I'M MY ENEMY

Said it's been a long time coming, but now I'm sure
that ever word you wrote, you spoke you told
just matters so much more.
And its been a longtime wasted, left my feelings at the door
and now the time it takes to go back baby and
pick them off the floor.

Woah, you never know a heart until its broke
if you were right, yeah i was wrong.

YOU GOT ME ALL TIED UP IN KNOTS

as we breathe in the last breath of your voice
were still groove' to the same beats, as we dance
Do do do you know, everything? and how we made it.

Its been a long time running from distances with out a cure
every breath, i breath, i breathe you in, it feels just like before
and its been a long time fallen from eyes that were never true
i think of your eyes your smile and how they lied, until the day that i met you.

Woah, you never know a heart until its broke
if you were right, yeah i was wrong.

YOU GOT ME ALL TIED UP IN KNOTS

as we breathe in the last breath of your voice
were still groove' to the same beats, as we dance
Do do do you know, everything? and how we made it.

Someday you will see, just what you mean to me.
