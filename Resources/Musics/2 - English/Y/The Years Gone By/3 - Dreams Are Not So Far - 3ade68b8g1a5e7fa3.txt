DREAMS ARE NOT SO FAR

I want to leave this place, with headlights and break lights,
I'm my making choice to be anything and everything and more.
I can't stand this place, demanding decision of how to run my life
you cant fill me up with your fake thoughts because they never were important to me
you'll see how everything around me, everything is change
you'll see that we can make this all last forever

I would stop but that means to let go...
of a dream that I've been wishing for so long
I would stop but that means to let go
I believe, I believe in you.

Seize the day, cherish the sunlight its our only hope
it fills, fills me up with dreams for later life.
before the years go by, i want to make my life, worth the time it takes to die
sing the songs i write to show my life.

You'll see that one day finally,
my dream of capturing every hope and dream is now my reality

I would stop but that means to let go...
of a dream that I've been wishing for so long
I would stop but that means to let go
I believe, I believe in you.

YEAH!

You'll never know, don't stop the feeling just let it go
You'll never know, don't stop the feeling just let it go
DON'T STOP THE FEELING
You'll never know, don't stop the feeling just let it go
You'll never know, don't stop the feeling just let it go
