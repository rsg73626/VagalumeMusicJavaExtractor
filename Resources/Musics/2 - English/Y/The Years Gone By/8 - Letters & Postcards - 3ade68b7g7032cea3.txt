LETTERS & POSTCARDS

If i would be everything
You ever wanted
You ever needed
I'd be so far away from this photograph
And so close to my heart
The states that separate us are
What makes this so hard

And we've got it all
To every letter to every post card
Baby we've said it all
The words that hurt that mean so much to me

Press rewind turn back this tape
Just slow down
Or your never gonna get it right
I can sing the lines to let you know the break before the fall
Or the time it takes to recreate and sing them in this song

And we've got it all
To every letter to every post card
Baby we've said it all
The words that hurt that mean so much to me

And we've got it all
To every letter to every post card
Baby we've said it all
The words that hurt that mean so much to me

And we've got it alllllllllll

And we've got it all
To every letter to every post card
Baby we've said it all
The words that hurt that mean so much to me

And we've got it all
To every letter to every post card
Baby we've said it all, said it all along
