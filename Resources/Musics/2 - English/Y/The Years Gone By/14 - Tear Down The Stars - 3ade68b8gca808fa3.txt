TEAR DOWN THE STARS

Picture this.
 The rain is pouring out side And the streetlights just won’t give us enough… 
Light to see the direction we have to go. 
Don’t let, anyone know, where we will run to I need those lips that ignite my bones.
 (and keep my heart afloat) 
Tear down the stars and I’ll give them to you.
 There not as pretty as your eyes, but I guess this will have to do. 
Tear down the stars, we can ride it to the moon. 
I'll float till I find you I wouldn’t ever let you fall…down. Picture this. 
Our clothes are soaked but it’s fine Cuz the fires still burning in our Eyes…the heat…might be more than we can stand. Don’t let, anyone know, where we will run to I need those lips that ignite my bones. (and keep my heart afloat) Tear down the stars and I’ll give them to you. There not as pretty as your eyes, but I guess this will have to do. Tear down the stars, we can ride to the moon. Float till I find you I wouldn’t ever let you fall, With out me under you. (under you) I'll back down. If I had the chance. I would make it all okay. I would make you feel like, your the only one who matters. Most. If I had the chance, I would replace all the grays, with sunny days. We can sit for hours on my roof and tell the rain to go away. Go away.
