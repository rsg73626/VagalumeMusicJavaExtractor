SUNDAYS BEST

Motionless I fall down, from waiting for nothing
Tired of scream my lungs out, cuz I have given up on you
The only thing that I've found
It's easy. To gerget when your unconscious
And I forgot for so many nights in a row
I miss the way your heartbeats I still feel it beating
If I counted my sleepless nights, I'd be up and counting (every night)
But then you said the words. I miss you and I'm so. so over it
You know I'm such a sucker for the way you say you're sorry
You got my heartbeat racing again, like you wouldn't believe

I would take it back in a heartbeat
I know this. I'm lost without you
I can't got back. cuz I need to be the one you're saving
Sunday's best we're never perfect and my regrets could never surface
(Tell me) tell me tell me once again...
How I'm the best part of believing

4 am, it's pointless
To think I'll be sleeping next to you
Pills won't hold me back
The way I'd remember holding on to you
It's scary to think how I line my walls with lyrics to all your favorite songs
and how I still wear my heart on my sleeve to see
exactly what it's missing. You from me

I would take it back in a heartbeat
I know this. I'm lost without you
I can't got back. cuz I need to be the one you're saving
Sunday's best we're never perfect and my regrets could never Surface
(tell me) tell me tell me once again...
How I'm the best part of believing

You can catch me on the rooftop
I'll be the on screaming
Your name at the top of my lungs
It's a certain grave I do everything for you in vain.
I open up and fall right on my face

I would take it back in a heartbeat
I know this. I'm lost without you
I can't got back. cuz I need to be the one you're saving
Sunday's best we're never perfect and my regrets could never Surface.
(Tell me) tell me tell me once again...
How I'm the best part of believing
