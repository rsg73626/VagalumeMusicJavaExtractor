THE TRANSLATION

You need a phrase to describe how you're feeling
don't misinturpret your language for emotions
your phone is ringing, it's ringing off the hook and
you'll finally know what it feels like to feel lonely

don't leave backing out is not an option,
you'd sell your heart away if there was an auction
you say you love her
say you trust her say you really care
say you're a liar
at least your honesty is there

woah this kid is a goner
woah this kid is a loner
say the worst lines
say you're alright
baby now, come on now, it's all in how it seems
say the worst lines
let it slide by
baby now, come on now, it's all in how it seems to be
it's all in how it seems to be

don't be ashamed to describe all your feelings
or get caught up in the single greatest moment
you can't reject something that you have never had before
give it up, give it up for all the love in your heart

woah this kid is a goner
woah this kid is a loner
say the worst lines
say youre alright
baby now, come on now, it's all in how it seems
say the worst lines
let it slide by
baby now, come on now, it's all in how it seems to be

woah this kid is a goner
woah this kid is a loner
woah this kid is a goner
woah this kid is a loner

you never wanted to be anything but your own
you never wanted to breath
any air if your not breathing it in deeply.
you never wanted to be
anything but your own

say the worst lines
say youre alright
baby now, come on now, it's all in how it seems
say the worst lines
let it slide by
baby now, come on now, it's all in how it seems to be
it's all in how it seems to be
