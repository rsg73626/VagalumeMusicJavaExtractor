MY MIRACLE

How about we take our medicine before you hit the bed tonight 
Because you're my inspiration and you always know what's right 
Be sure to take what you're given then use it to motivate you 
Don't let it go away for all the things you want to do 

You're so strong, I'm a brother who knows best 
I'll put my life away if it means your life's at rest 

I'll be your best kid from the very end 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live tonight like there's nothing left to change 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change 
Tonight I'll rescue you from the flame 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live tonight like there's nothing left to change 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change 

Abruptly kiss your mother gently to let her know you love her 
It might be easy knowing that there's no one else above her 
A second chance is what you're given, a chance to watch the sunrise 
A time to watch a night fall, a time to raise your own 

You're so strong, I'm a brother who knows best 
I'll put my life away if it means your life's at rest 

I'll be your best kid from the very end 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live life like there's nothing left to say 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change 
Tonight I'll rescue you from the pain 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live life like there's nothing left to change 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change 

I'll be your best kid from the very end 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live life like there's nothing left to change 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change 
Tonight I'll rescue you from the flame 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live life like there's nothing left to change 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change 

I'll be your best kid from the very end 
Making sure I take all the pain 
Live life like there's nothing left to say 
If we live how we want, there's nothing left to change
