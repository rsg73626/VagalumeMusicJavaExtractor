EYES FOR LIARS

Lay down the distance 
Just keeping quiet 
This conversation is almost over 

You ran away 
Don't come back to me 
So far away 
You'll never know what you are 

Instead of, living just, put me out of misery 
Here and now, I'm finding out, that everything I want is everything that I need 

Everything that's sweet to the last touch of your cheek 
I thought you'd never let me down 
I thought you'd never let me down 
You're all the same, just longing for change 
You lied to me, I hope you get what you deserve 

Instead of, living just, put me out of misery 
Here and now, I'm finding out, that everything I want is everything that I need 

Instead of, living just, put me out of misery 
Here and now, I'm finding out, that everything I want is everything that I know 

You run away 
I need you to know 
You run away 
Tonight, to know 
That everything I want, is everything I need 
Tonight, to know 
That everything I want, is everything I need
