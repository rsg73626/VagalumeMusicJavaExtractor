TELL SOMEONE ELSE (I DON'T CARE)

Tell Someone Else (I Don't Care)
Im still big on saying sorry..
 like every chance I get I say 
I'm sorry that i met you. 
I'm still big on taking chances (whoa) when every chance i see you, is another chance i get to walk away..
 I'll give every last word to you.
 You make your self sound dumber when you're mad you know i always hated that. 
Every first kiss, will be better, more noticed.
 And softer then your lips Every love sick note, On my wall, i threw out... this sickness won't weigh me down. Unfaithful is ridden on your shoulders.
 our faith gets tested hard when your living for the moment.
 I've settled, We're taking back, all the memories wasted on you. 
Every first kiss, will be better, more noticed. 
And softer then your lips Every love sick note, On my wall, i threw out... this sickness won't weigh me down.
