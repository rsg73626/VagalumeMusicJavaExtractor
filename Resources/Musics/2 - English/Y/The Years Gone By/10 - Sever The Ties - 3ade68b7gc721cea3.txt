SEVER THE TIES

What lies ahead is hit or miss 
Carefully planned out every step 
Why can't we leave? 
Why can't we leave it be? 
The things you hope may be down the road 
We can learn to break the mold 
We live disaster 
My heart beats faster for you 

We fell in love 
You're all I'm dreaming of 
I've fighting and I am losing sleep 

Well we severed the lies that were sewn into your heart 
And made it beautiful 
We severed the lies that get sewn into your heart 
We make it beautiful 

The price we pay 
We hate we make 
The routines that we live are short break free of tradition 
So stop and listen 
Make the call of who's at fault 
Discover the truth that tells it's all 
We lost our passion 
We thought it lasted for years 

We fell in love 
You're all I'm dreaming of 
I've fighting and I am losing sleep 

Well we severed the lies that were sewn into your heart 
And made it beautiful 
We severed the lies that get sewn into your heart 
We make it beautiful 

We fell in love 
You're all I'm dreaming of 
I've fighting and I am losing sleep 

Well we severed the lies that get sewn into your heart 
And made it beautiful 
We severed the lies that get sewn into your heart 
We make it beautiful 

Don't sell yourself short 
Don't write yourself off 
There's more than your magazines 
So beautiful but so wrong 
We severed 
You're so beautiful
