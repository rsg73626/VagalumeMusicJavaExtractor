THIS IS YOUR SONG

You can be everything 
You can be anything 
You can be... 

I said I really wanna go 
Running after days and nights 
Your my favorite disaster, girl 
Are you there girl? (Are you there?) 
Make your move but do it slowly 
Cause you're the one hardly holding on to, to me, girl 

Do you know what's real? 
Sometimes I can't feel 

You can be everything 
You can be anything 
You can be anything and everything 
Anything and everything, it's all yours 
Everything 
You can be anything 
You can be anything and everything 
Anything and everything, it's all yours 

We never really got along 
So well in my dreams were yours but yours ran out 
And I'm trying, to pull through (to pull through) 
Maybe if we spent some time 
I'll flash up your dream expense so hard to lose control 
Don't lose control 

Do you know what's real? 
Sometimes I can't feel 

You can be anything 
You can be everything 
You can be anything and everything 
Anything and everything, it's all yours 
You can be everything 
You can be anything 
You can be anything and everything 
Anything and everything, it's all yours 

Hey, your so obvious 
And hey, I'm the one who's insecure 

But do you know what's real? 
Sometimes I can't feel, feel 

You can be everything 
You can be anything 
You can be anything and everything 
Anything and everything, it's all yours 
You can be anything 
You can be everything 
You can be anything and everything 
Anything and everything, it's all yours
