AMOR A PRIMEIRA VISTA

Amor a Primeira Vista
 
"Yang $nap
Você acredita em amor a primeira vista?
Ahã, eu acredito!"

Quando eu te olhei, eu arrepiei
Quase te beijei, mais falei baby não foi dessa vez
Vai ter mais uma chance para nos encontrar
Espero algum dia poder te beijar, te tocar
Eu tava no shopping gastano com os panos
Você passou do meu lado e eu fiquei olhando
Fiquei te esperando, você não apareceu
Você sumiu e nem me deu adeus (bye-bye)
Mais você voltou, agora tá do meu lado
Te dou uns brincos, relógio bem caro
Vamos aproveitar nosso momento juntos
Vão la pra minha casa ficar deitado juntos
Faço com carinho, te mostro o caminho
Baby vem comigo, deixa esse menino (like you)
Você vai ser mais feliz perto de mim
Vem baby, você é que me faz sorrir

I ain't never have nobody show me all the things that
you do
N' show me in a special i feel when you hold me
We gon always be together, Baby thats what you told
me
And I believe it I ain't never have nodody do me like
you

And everytime I think about you (I have)
When you cryed when you call when you come around
Your love is amazing to me, I cant wait till I see
you
I wanna be with you again, And everytime your out on
the road (I'll make the trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show (dont you forget)
That im your main chick, who got the game chick
One of the same chick the one you can hang with

I ain't never have nobody show me all the things that
you do
N' show me in a special i feel when you hold me
We gon always be together, Baby thats what you told
me
And I believe it I ain't never have nodody do me like
you  
Okay, hit the mall pop tags spend a few geez
Then hit the runway to a new season
See it aint nothing sport it when I care for
Feel like im not doing enough, Thats when I share
more
I give you this give you that what you need love
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I aint trying to let you go
I get with you when I can, So thats how I let you
know
You be tripping cuz sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holla to ride up at my shows
And I was trippin in a sense I was tense
But my body dont surround you, Wat I'm a do with out
you
I gotta get it together say whatever
But since I met you my life seems so much better

I aint never have nobody show me all the things that
you do
N' show me in a special I feel when you hold me
We gon always be together, Baby thats what you told
me
And I believe it 'cause I aint have nodody do me like
you (2x)
