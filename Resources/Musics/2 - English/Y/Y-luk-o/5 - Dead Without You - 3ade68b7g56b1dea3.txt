DEAD WITHOUT YOU

send me away i must be free
lieing awake all alone
said - never shall i see, never will i bleed again
i am far away from you
never shall i be back to you again

i know what i’ve seen
seen you love again
i can’t help my pain
think i’ll just be gone

but, if i see you again
i don’t know how i feel
the pain is hard to bear
truth is, i still love you

and now i dream of the past
times when i hold you close
together, laughing, holding hands
i’m crying now without you
pain will not rescend
gave my life for you
know not what to be
think i’m dead without you
