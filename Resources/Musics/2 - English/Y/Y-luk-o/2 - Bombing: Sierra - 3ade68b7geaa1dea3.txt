BOMBING: SIERRA

One
Gave me comfort and relief
When it was time to weep
One 
Been there to hear my sorrow
Sympathy for my pain

Who are you
Like a torch in the dark
Who are you
Like a riddle unsolved
Who are you
That is never asking
Who are you
That is all in life

One 
Hand I grabbed and pulled away
One
Used to sit next to me
One
Thought the way I did
One
Shared the lunacy of mine

One 
Marched on the battlefields of love
And dried the tears I shed
One
Became the guarding hand
Always gave shelter from the cold

Who are you
Like a torch in the dark...

Just once more
You are here
Never let me fallin'
Again 
That deep

Without a word you know
How precious you are

I would never commit the heresy
Of betraying you
There is just one word to say:
Friend
