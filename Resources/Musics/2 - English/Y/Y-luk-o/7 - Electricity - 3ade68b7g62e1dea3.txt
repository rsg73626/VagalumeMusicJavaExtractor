ELECTRICITY

feel the pressure
warm - cold
deep penetrating
my heart sink
touch the skin - soft
silky tender mind
eyes briefly met
like randomly
no smile will emerge
but from behind
it's like trepanating me

we like to progress
electricity is in the air
but we hesitate
and time is running out

back and forth
back and forth
the clock won't stop
back and forth
back and forth
i need you

left rejected
neglected
warm soft whole
no trepidation
whore lick temper
mutual masturbation
no smile will emerge
and from behind 
it's like trepanating me
