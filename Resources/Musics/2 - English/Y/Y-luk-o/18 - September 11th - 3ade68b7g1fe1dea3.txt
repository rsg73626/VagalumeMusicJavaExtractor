SEPTEMBER 11TH

i feel it now
right deep in my heart
this violation
has left it’s mark
my flesh it tingles
i start to cry
all this violence
i ask god why
why take our children
from our hands
and send as soldiers
to foreign lands

taste my tears
take my fears
hold me tight
say it’s alright
taste my tears
no more fears
time to stand tall
we will not fall

still in pain
i see the tears
streak your face
you’re still in fear
scared to live
afraid to die
face the enemy
run and hide
how could this happen
what did we do
we didn’t want war
why did you
