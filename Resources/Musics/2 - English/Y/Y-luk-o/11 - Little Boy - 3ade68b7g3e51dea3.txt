LITTLE BOY

A little boy
Leaning against the car
Big brown eyes
As he looked at me
Observing
Demanding
What next step I would dare to do
Waitress serves the tablet
I watch her from behind
And her beautiful ass
Wonder how it feeled if I fucked here

Sit back
A cup of coffee in my hand
Enjoy
The late sunday morning
With the smell makes me smile upon the world
And its misery

With a smile
The boy walks away
Does he know me that well?

Sit back...
