PLASTIC

His plastic prophecy has come true
This is what I have decayed into 
Sooner or later I will be machine 
Emptiness no rigor mortis could wean 

No pain 
No sorrow 
No love 
No greater tomorrow 

Do you remember being human?
Do you remember what it means to forgive?
Do you remember showing empathy? 

Nothing to ease the years 
When your pulse is the grinding of gears

Do you remember being human?
Do you remember what it means to forgive?
Do you remember showing empathy?

This plastic prophecy continues
This reality is now true
Its now later
Time is gone
I have become machine
Emptiness
This I have deemed

I have become machine
Emptiness this I have deemed
I have become machine!
