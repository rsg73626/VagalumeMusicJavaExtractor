FURTHER

fear and loathing
i knew it would come to this
sinking further
into this dark abyss
nothing harder
then holding onto conciousness
know i'm dying
reaching the end
final bliss

twisting furhter insanity
my bodies lying below me
floating clear of mortality
my body's dead
but my soul is free

endless staring
my eyes sift through reality
ever darker
this hopelessness inside of me
but i cant die peacefully
not a martyrer
no one's careing 
alone for eternity
