S.K.E.S. (FEAT. KIR FATAL)

Slowly fading
Thoughts abound
Where are you
I’m cold tonight
It’s been so long but still i love
So come
Come, be with me

Reaching out
To stroke your cheak
Back of the car
Tears slip away
Know i have to leave
Know i have to leave
Crying softly for you

Take me now
Hold me now
Take me now
Into your arms

Slowly fading...
The way you agreed
Never been the way you feel
I ran after you
Try to reach your hand
Never you turned around
