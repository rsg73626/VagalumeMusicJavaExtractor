RED

recently
i was closing to red
her eyes were so distant
but i caught one view
invincible to
invincible to
invincible to me

suddenly
flow of speech took away
southern-bound
and somewhere i’ve never been
you were so kind to me
so kind to
so kind to me

now i’m sitting alone
longing
for a shine of red
to be in my life again
the lightning to
the lightning to
the lightning to me
