A VIEW INTO THE CORNER

The door is just leaned not closed
Betraying a small glimpse of dark
She is leaned against the toilet
Leaned against white porcelain
Leaned against the toilet
And cutting her wrists
She is cutting her wrists
In the corner near the toilet

Helplessly she is
And her dead eyes full of tears
Yes, blue-eyed is the girl
Cutting her arm
And blood drips into the water
She is cutting her wrists
In the corner near the toilet
In the corner near the toilet

The blade in the hand
Moving emotionless through flesh
Bloody wrists
No cry no pain no tenderness
Only the cold white porcelain
Will help be there for her?

Loosing consciousness
People laughing in the living room
Bloods drips into the water
Drips onto white porcelain
And her head hits the wall
In the corner of the toilet
