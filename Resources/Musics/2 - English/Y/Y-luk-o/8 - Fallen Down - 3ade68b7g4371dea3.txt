FALLEN DOWN

Exasperation
I feel too much
Suffocation
I need too much
Deliberation
Afraid to touch
Emancipation
Should I touch
Annihilation
Everything has fallen down
Everything has fallen down

Confessions
I need you
Regressions
I love you
Impressions

I cannot survive like this
Transgressions
I am not alive like this
Depressions

Our effigies come crashing down
Everything has fallen down

Everything has fallen down, fallen down, fallen down

Everything has fallen down, everything, everything
