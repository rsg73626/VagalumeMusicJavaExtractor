THE SINGING BARD

Hoping for the big light
Stepping out on my own
Seeking fame and fortune
Yet I’m still alone
Only started playing
People just pass me by
No money for true art
Not even a wave hi
But still I play
For it's my love
My one true passion
Blessed by god above

Just me and my guitar
And a lonely road
Traveled long and far
My seeds I’ve sowed
Now I’m an old man
Traveled long and hard
What do I have to show?
I’m a lonely singing bard
