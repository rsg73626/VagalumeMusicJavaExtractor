CRAM IT WITH WALNUTS (FEAT. I FEEL SICK) INTERLUDE NO. 26

do you see this saw I see
my hats under attack
someone call the harbature
flys on a rabbits back
playing cards on the roof top
zombies swinging clocks
lost in a box of nothing 
im all tyed up with socks

shouting in brail I can not see
why social lifes Affecting me

i'm stuck
leave me alone I found my way home
and I don’t need your hand to walk me thru the dark room
rebuilt
better than before I found a new door
and I don’t need your hand to walk me thru the dark room no more
