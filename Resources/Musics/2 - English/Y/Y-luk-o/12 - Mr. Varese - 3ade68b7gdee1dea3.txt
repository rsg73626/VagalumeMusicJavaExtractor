MR. VARESE

Liberation from the arbitrary paralyzing tempered system
The possibility of obtaining any number of cycles if still desired
Subdivisions of the octave
And consequently the formation of any desired scale
Unsuspecting range of low and high registers 
New harmonic splendors
Obtainable from the use of sub-harmonic combinations now impossible
The possibility of obtaining any differential of timbre 
Of sounds combination and new dynamics far beyond the present human 
Powered orchestra
