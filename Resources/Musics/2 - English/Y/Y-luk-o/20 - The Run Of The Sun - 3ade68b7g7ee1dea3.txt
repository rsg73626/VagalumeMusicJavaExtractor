THE RUN OF THE SUN

when the sun gave birth to a new day
horizon was burning red
and the tender veil of fog over the fields
dispersed in the rays of light
silently attenting the play
i felt
this is a place to be and to keep
deep in heart
so deep in heart

tear-hearts gave
all they could
but it seemed to need much more
to stop
the run of the sun
but never cease to try

and the day had become not yet that ld
when a cry ringed out in pain
the virgin peace got sacrificied
to a mind of cruelty
silently i looked away and felt
there is something not left the same
as is used to be...
as it used to be?
