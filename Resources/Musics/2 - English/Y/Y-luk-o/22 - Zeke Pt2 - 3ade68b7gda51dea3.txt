ZEKE PT2

and i remember
i'll never forget
and i remember
the night that i left

asleep in your bed
your eyes on me
i feel you closer
come to me

so we drifted
apart we fade
know it can't be
insane

wake from my sleep
just another dream
glimpse of false reality
love isn't what it seems

in my dreams
it's all the same
i pull you close
you scream my name

still i dream
more of the same
i pull you close
you forgot my name

time has come 
to leave again
marks you left to me
pain me in
