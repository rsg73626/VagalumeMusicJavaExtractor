THEORETICAL LOVE

True love has no guarantee
I guess life's a mystery
You're fire and I'm water
That's just how it is my friend
Love is not a concept, no

Is this how you feel?
Theoretical love
Let's make something real
We got a good thing going on
If we don't try we will fall
It doesn't make any sense at all
Theoretical love
Theoretical love

You say, "Stick to the plan"
And I say, "It's out of your hands"
You can make it happen
And what you see is what you'll get
Love is not a concept

Is this how you feel?
Theoretical love
Let's make something real
We got a good thing going on
If we don't try we will fall
It doesn't make any sense at all
Theoretical love

Whoa oh whoa
What you see is what you get
So let it happen

Is this how you feel?
Theoretical love
Let's make something real
We got a good thing going on
If we don't try we will fall
It doesn't make any sense at all
Theoretical love
Theoretical love
