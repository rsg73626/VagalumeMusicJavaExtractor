SET ME FREE

why are we fighting
why are we lying
maybe god come and help me out
but he can't see the damned in this crowd

did i loose it all
how did i miss the call
conform me to an image of a doll
break me up against his wall

i can't look in the mirror
and see myself standing there
all i see is an illusion
fighting a war against the ones that care
no need for saving just set me free

can you please forgive me
words can't say the makings
buildings crumble down under
and lovers crash at the sound of thunder

i once believed
honesty was key
but i cant stay and live this way
cuz every time i stand you take it away

i can't look in the mirror
and see myself standing there
all i see is an illusion
fighting a war against the ones that care
no need for saving just set me free

once i was young now im old
to see the truth that hides in me

i can't look in the mirror
and see myself standing there
all i see is an illusion
fighting a war against the ones that care
no need for saving just set me free

i just can't look in the mirror
and see myself standing there
all i see is an illusion
fighting a war against the ones that care
no need for saving just set me free
