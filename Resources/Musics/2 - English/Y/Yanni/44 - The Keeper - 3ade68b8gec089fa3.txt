THE KEEPER

I’ve been like a bird without song for a while
Dry like a lake without rain for a while
You suddenly stepped in my life
And made me cry like an angel
Ooh, you’re something else
Like a smile without end

Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper

You’re pulling me closer and you’re flowin’ in
With every emotion that rushes in

Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

I’ve been like a home without people for a while
Empty like a poem without words for a while
You suddenly stepped in my life
And made me shine like a diamond
Ooh, you’re something else
Like a dream without end

Come into my life, go a little deeper
Come into my life, you could be the keeper
All I have
You’re pulling me closer and you’re flowing in
All I have
With every emotion that rushes in

Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
Ooh you’re something else
Like a dream without end

Come into my life, go a little deeper
Come into my life, you could be the keeper

All I have
You’re pulling me closer and you’re flowing in
All I have
With every emotion that rushes in

Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
All I have
All I have

Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
