NEVER LEAVE THE SUN

I know your out of a restless day
Walk on road where a dream can change
They call me there when a lights were lost
Tryin to make sense
Show me the world with an open heart
Lookin inside everything you are
i'm only there when I try to dream
Tryin to make sense, over

You tell me that i'm strong enough
i'm wanna runaway i'm wanna fly into your arms
And never leave the sun
Oh I, I will never leave the sun

Someone between or to believe
i'm taken a chance that you promised me
Someone between never more and done
And givin to love

You tell me that i'm strong enough
i'm wanna runaway
i'm wanna fly into your arms
And never leave the sun
Oh I, I will never leave the sun
never gonna leave the sun! tell me...
You tell me that i'm strong enough
i'm never gonna leave the sun
I wanna fly into your arms
I never gonna leave the sun

You tell me that i'm strong enough
i'm wanna runaway i'm wanna fly into your arms
And never leave the sun
Oh I, I will never leave the sun
