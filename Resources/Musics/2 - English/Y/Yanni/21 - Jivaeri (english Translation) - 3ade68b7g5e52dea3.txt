JIVAERI (ENGLISH TRANSLATION)

Now a foreign land watches him grow,
My precious one,
My life's sweet smelling blossom,
Silently and humbly.

God, I was the one who sent him there,
My precious one,
It was my own will,
Humbly I'm stepping on my land.

Damn you foreign lands,
YOu're winds lured him away,
Your promises for promised lands,
Silently and humbly.

How could you take my lad away,
Foreign land,
And lure him to be yours,
Humbly I'm stepping on my land.
