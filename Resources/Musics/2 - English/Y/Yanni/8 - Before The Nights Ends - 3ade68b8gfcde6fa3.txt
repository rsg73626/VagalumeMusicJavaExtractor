BEFORE THE NIGHTS ENDS

Interpretada por Leslie Mills

I close my eyes 
To see the world
I close my eyes 
So that it won't hurt
I'm sailing on blue ocean
Flying to you how

I catch my breath
Under the full moon
A star that shines
So pleased to meet you
Maybe I'll dream forever
I'd like to love right here

Before the night ends
And darling the new day dawns
How I hope
How I hope
That out of this endless blue
Somehow I will find you
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

I've made a choice more than a few times
To walk a road that didn't end up so right
But I wanna go the distance
I'm going to love right here

Before the night ends
And darling the new day dawns
How I hope
How I hope
That out of this endless blue
Somehow I will find you
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

Close my eyes
Never gonna let it

Before the night ends
I hope I find you
