CHANGE

How could I ever know 
I would find myself alone
Facing your daemons as well as mine
Wishing for the past that words cannot find.

But somewhere in the night
The music in my mind comes alive
I hear love's haunting lullaby.
And it sings of a time we once knew
A time when all I could breathe was you
But seasons never remain the perfect shade
Our love's not the same so we must
Change... change... change

How could I ever know 
That with time you would go
Leaving me to find what
Was missing in between our lives

But somewhere in the night
The music in my mind comes alive
I hear love's haunting lullaby
And it sings of a time we once knew
A time when all I could breathe was you
But seasons never remain the perfect shade
Our love's not the same so we must
Change...

Once we had summer in the fall
Now my heart knows what it's like
To lose it all...
