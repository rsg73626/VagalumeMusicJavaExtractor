SECRET

Tell me what lies behind your eyes
Your beauty fades
But the passion comes alive

Tell me again, how your dream begins
Cause when the night falls
It's alright with me
If you wanna make believe

Whisper your laugh in my ear
The world disappears and only I can hear

Music descending, hearts transcending
And only in this moment we hold the key

I got a secret, I only tell if you want
Nobody's got to know, oh no
Nobody's got to know
I got a secret, can you keep it
Nobody's got to know, oh no
Nobody's got to know

Try to forget the past
Somethings remain and others never last
Just by this minute
Why don't we finish what we started long ago
You can't say no

I got a secret, I only tell if you want
Nobody's got to know, oh no
Nobody's got to know
I got a secret, can you keep it
Nobody's got to know, oh no
Nobody's got to know
