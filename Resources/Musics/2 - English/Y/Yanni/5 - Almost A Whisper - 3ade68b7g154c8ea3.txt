ALMOST A WHISPER

The sound of holding on - almost a whisper
The sigh of broken hearts - a quiet cry
The rain upon your face
Brings gravity and grace
And softly you begin to breathe again

I don't have all the answers to your sad prayer
But if I could I'd give you angel's wings
To go where hope is found
With strength to reach beyond
And carries like a song upon the wind

Please don't give up
Please don't you give up
Cuz I believe
Yes, I believe
I still believe... in us

The sound of holdin on - almost a whisper
The sigh of broken hearts - a quiet cry
The rain upon your face
Brings gravity and grace
And softly you begin to breathe again
