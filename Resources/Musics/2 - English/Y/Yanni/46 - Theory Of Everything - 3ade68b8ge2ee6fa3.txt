THEORY OF EVERYTHING

Life is a miracle, 
There's a theory for everything..
Like a flower that is growing up from a stone, 
I want to protect you, 
I want you to flourish, 
But some directions you have to 
Figure out on your own
ahhh,ahhh,ahhahaohahha

I wonder how freely you would imagine the scenery, 
You'd write a kingdom, you were a princess of love..
But time can get jaded,
People will wonder 
Cause there is a theory for everything,
Right or wrong
..ahhha,ahahaha, 
a theory for everything, a theory for everything

All the memories the music,
And all the music the future
And the Theory of Everything is nothing without love...
The theory of everything is nothing without love...
Ooo...Ahhhh
Ooo...Ahhhh
I love who you are

The theory you want to be
Of all the choice in this world
I hope you will believe...
Everything, everything, theory of everything, 
Everything, everything, theory of everything, 
Ooo...Ahhh
Ooo...Ahhh
The theory of everything is nothing without love...
The theory of everything is nothing without love...
