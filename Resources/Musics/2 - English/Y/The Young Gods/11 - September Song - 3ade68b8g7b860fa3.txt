SEPTEMBER SONG

Oh, it's a long, long while from may to december
But the days grow short when you reach september
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, november
And these few precious days i'll spend with you
These precious days i'll spend with you
