KISSING THE SUN

Soon we will be on our way
Say goodbye to yesterday

Soon we will be in the light
Swimming in the open sky

We’ll spread our wings around the stars
Watch the way we drop our scars

We will be kissing the sun
Everybody knows kissing the sun
One and one with the one you’ve chosen

We’ll spread our wings as we get higher
Spread our wings into the fire

We will be kissing the sun
Everybody knows kissing the sun
One and one And the thing explodes
