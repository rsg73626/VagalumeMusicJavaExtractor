SKINFLOWERS

gimme something skin
something like an flower

gimme something warm
something like forever

gimme something hard
something ready to start

gimme something strong
and i'll sing this song

gimme something skin
something like an shelter

gimme something deep
something you don't wanna keep

gimme something love
something without an glove

gimme something wrong
and i'll sing this song

one for the skinflowers

skinflowers

gimme gimme gimme

what is burning inside
with warmer sun outside (x2)

one for the skinflowers

skinflowers

i said skinflowers

flowers
