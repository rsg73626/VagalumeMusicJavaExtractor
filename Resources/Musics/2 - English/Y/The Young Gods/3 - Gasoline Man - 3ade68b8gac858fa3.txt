GASOLINE MAN

I'm an gasoline man
i dunno where i go
i'm gonna drive and drive
i wanna get there on time

i'm an gasoline man

i wanna take my hand
and put it on the wheel

i'm an gasoline man
gonna set your world on fire
i'm gonna drive and drive
find out where you hide

say an little prayer for the mother
gasoline baby

i'm an gasoline man
i dunno where i go
i'm gonna drive and drive
find out where you hide

say an little prayer for the mother baby
say an little prayer for the mother (x2)
