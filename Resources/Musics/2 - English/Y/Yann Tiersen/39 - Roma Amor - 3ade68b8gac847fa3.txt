ROMA AMOR

we met in a bar
nothing special so far
until the moment they suggested a drive to the coast
minutes later we hit the road
the guy who was driving was fat and dressed in black
and all of a sudden he blew his top
when i told him he was driving too fast
i kept quiet for a while
then i said
" i know of a dive further west
let's go and i pay my round"
but no answer was to be heard
and then they stopped the car
got me out without a word
got me to undress
laid me down on the sand and pissed all over my body
insulting me the hardest way
i seemed to be attracting them the very same way
blood attracts sharks and pitbull terriers

boys you've been after me
yes you've been tracing me
and now you've captured me
what a pleasure it must be
but before you stab your prey
before i pass away
be sure that i lived for this
and this is my gift

"we're gonna make you eat your balls
we're gonna get rid of you
so shove your bloody dignity aside
and prepare yourself for dying like a dog"
one barked
so i had a thought for my family
remember my first lover
understood i'd never see the sun setting on this roman beach
and felt the cold blade of a flick-knife
penetrating me

boys you've been after me
yes you've been tracing me
and now you've captured me
what a pleasure it must be
but before you stab your prey
before i pass away
be sure that i lived for this
and this is my gift
