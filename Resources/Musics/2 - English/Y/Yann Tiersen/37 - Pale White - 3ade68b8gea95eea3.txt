PALE WHITE

Mr Haley turned and said 
You must not cry now 
Crossed the ocean 
For his love 
To bring her falter 

And his chest beat like a wolf 
To bring her home 
And his chest beat like a wolf 
To bring her home 

Nobody will come dance 
Will come dance upon our grave 
Nobody will come dance 
Will come dance with us 

Her face's so delicate and bright 
In alabaster 

And his chest beat like a wolf 
To bring her home 
And his chest beat like a wolf 
To bring her home 

And if ever you try to sever 
All the things we've come to know 
And if you ever try to sever 
All the things we know 

Nobody will come dance 
Will come dance upon our grave 
Nobody will come dance 
Will come dance with us
