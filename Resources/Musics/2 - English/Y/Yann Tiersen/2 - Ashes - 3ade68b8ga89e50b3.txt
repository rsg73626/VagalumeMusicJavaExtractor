ASHES

We're following a road of pain
We're all running away to death
Please, come back and hold me tight
Let's burn and burn again
All in all, we will be ashes
Floating in the winds

We're following a road of pain
We're all running away to death
Please, come back and hold me tight
Let's burn and burn again
All in all, we will be ashes
Floating in the winds
