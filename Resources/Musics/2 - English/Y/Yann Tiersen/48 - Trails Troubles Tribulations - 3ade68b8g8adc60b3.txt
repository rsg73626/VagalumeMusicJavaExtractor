TRAILS TROUBLES TRIBULATIONS

Trials troubles tribulations
Such as never been before
When the angels pour upon us
Their vows of dread for ever more

When the fire comes down from heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
There forever with him be

The beasts with horns will come upon you
One with seven one with ten
They will cry unto the mountain
They'll pray to die but cannot win

The mark must be upon your forehead
These earthly goods you then can buy
Depart from me I never knew you
You'll hear my blessed savior cry
