GUILTY

is it a sin, is it a crime
loving you dear like i do
if it's a crime, then, i'm guilty
guilty of loving you

maybe i'm wrong dreaming of you
dreaming the lonely night thru
if it's a crime, then, i'm guilty
guilty of dreaming of you

what can i do?
what can i say?
after i've taken the blame
you say, "you're through
you'll go your way"

but i'll always feel just the same
maybe, i'm right, maybe i'm wrong
loving you dear like i do
if it's a crime, then, i'm guilty
guilty of loving you
