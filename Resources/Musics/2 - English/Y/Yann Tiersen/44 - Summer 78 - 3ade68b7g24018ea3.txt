SUMMER 78

Summer 78
Yann Tiersen
Composição: Indisponível

Where are you now
Can't you see me
Where are you now
Can't you hear me

Falling, trying
Searching, losing
Falling, trying
Searching, losing

Where is this land
We've built for us
Where are these streets
We've built for us

When I am laid
In Earth, in Earth
Can't you be there
Near me, near me

When I am laid
In Earth, in Earth
Can't you hold me,
can't you hold me
Please
