HESITATION WOUND

Maybe you're here, maybe you're not
You may be gone, you may be far
Deep in the green under my knees
Deep in the green under my knees

Hesitation Wound
Hesitation Wound

Maybe you're here, maybe you're not
You may be far, you may be close to me
Deep in the green inside my head
Deep in the green inside my head

Maybe I'm here, maybe I'm not
I may be gone I may be far away
Deep in the green into your arms
Deep in the green into your arms

Hesitation Wound
Hesitation Wound

I'm maybe gone deep in the green
