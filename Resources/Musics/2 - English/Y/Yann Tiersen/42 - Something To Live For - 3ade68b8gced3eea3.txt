SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR

Warm like the sun 
You give me your hand 
And say come in 
?? breath 
A funny face 
You say come in 
All has changed from here 
I will (come in)?? / I welcome it in 
All has changed 

Now i can't explain 
The path is newly paved 
And sorrow hides its face 
I've found someone to live for 
No i can't explain 
The path is newly paved 
And sorrow hides its face 
I've found someone to live for 

Give me your hand 
I'll lead the way 
No i can't explain 
The path is newly paved 
Sorrow hides in shame 
I've found someone to live for 

Someone to live for 
Now go 
Little sparrow 
I'll send you on your way 
With paper wings 
I'll send you on your way 
No i can't believe 
What i've seen 
No i just can't believe 
Farewell 
Little sparrow 
On your way
