DRIED SEA

Our trouble 
Come for me 
I row a dried up sea 
Trouble tore at my sleep(sleeve?) 
I row a dried up sea 

Ribbons to hide my face 
Shame does not come to claim 
Trouble tore at my sleep(sleeve?) 
I row a dried up sea 

Never you mind 
You can manage 
Never you mind 
You can manage 

Never you mind 
You can manage 
Never you mind 

Well....fuck that (?) 
I fail to explain (?) 

Never you mind 
You can manage 
And never you mind 

If, when you stand (?) 
Would you sleep (? ) 

Never you mind 
You can manage 
If you try 
You can manage 
You can manage 
You can manage 
If you try
