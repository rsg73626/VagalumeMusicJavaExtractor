RUE DES CASCADES

When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I don't see anything
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I hear nothing

In the cascade you washed me
In the cascade you washed me

When I wake up in Cascade Street
I feel nothing
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I don't remember

In the cascade you washed me
In the cascade you washed me
