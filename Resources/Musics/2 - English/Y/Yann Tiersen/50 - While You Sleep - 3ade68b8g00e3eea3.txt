WHILE YOU SLEEP

Temptation red 
Inside my head 
Temptation red 
Inside my head 

You're so innocent 
When you sleep 
You're so innocent 
When you sleep 

Oh my darling 
You're too good to eat 
Oh my darling 
You're too good to eat 

You're so innocent 
When you sleep 
You're so innocent 
When you sleep 

Come on, come on 
This can't be wrong. 
I'd put you in a bottle 
I'll take you away from harm 

Come on, come on 
This can't be wrong 
I'd put you in a bottle 
I'll take you away from harm 

Come on, come on 
This can't be wrong 
You're so innocent 
When you sleep
