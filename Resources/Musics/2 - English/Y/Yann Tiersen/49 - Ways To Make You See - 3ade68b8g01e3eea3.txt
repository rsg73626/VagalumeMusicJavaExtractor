WAYS TO MAKE YOU SEE

You are following me 
Under crusted teeth (?) 
No no no this cannot be 
You'll never know who I am 

Ways to make you see 
It's not that love has failed me 
Ways to make you see 
It's not that love has failed me 

Do you touch her 
Like you touch me 
Do you corrode her 
Like you corrode me 

Ways to make you see 
It's not that love has failed me 
Ways to make you see 
It's not that love has failed me 

I'm not the first 
One falling past (?) 
Voice that i've heard 
(how my?) Disguise (?) 
I'm not (hurt?) 
I'm not afraid (?) 
I'm not (afraid / praise?) 
I'm not afraid (?)
