LA DISPUTE

Anyway, i can try anything it's the same circle that leads to nowhere and i'm tired now. 
anyway, i've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everything is gone and i'm tired now. 
but don't be scared, i found a good job and i go to work every day on my old bicycle you loved. 
i am pilling up some unread books under my bed and i really think i'll never read again. 
no concentration, just a white disorder everywhere around me, you know i'm so tired now. 
don't worry i often go to dinners and parties with some old friends who care for me, take me back home and stay. 
monochrome floors, monochrome walls, only abscence near me, nothing but silence around me. 
monochrome flat, monochrome life, only abscence near me, nothing but silence around me. 
sometimes i search an event or something to remind me, but i've really got nothing in mind. 
sometimes i open the windows and listen people walking in the down streets. there is a life out there. 
but don't be scared, i found a good job and i go to work every day on my old bicycle you loved. 
anyway, i can try anything it's the same circle that leads to nowhere and i'm tired now. 
anyway, i've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everthing is gone gone and i'm tired now.
