LA PARADE

Another day to live
Another way to go
Nobody's in this room
Nobody's here for now

Wake up early
I know it's too late
To late for the parade

Look at my feet

But I'm too old inside

I'm so jealous
But proud to be
An ordinary girl
I'd like to talk
But you know I hate
All ordinary words

Naked
A bit sleepy
In my single room
I open the door
And call up call up the lift

I wish I was in the...
