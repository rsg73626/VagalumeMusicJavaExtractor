YAKYOKU

nagai nagai tabi no hate ni
  boku wa kono kishibe ni yatte kita
doko ni mukai nagareteru no?
  me no mae no kawa yo
  At the end of the long journey, I came to the shore
  Where is the river in front of me flowing to?

mukau basho mo miushinatte
  na noni naze boku wa ikiteru no?
toikaketemo kono keshiki wa 
  nani mo kotaenai
  Although I lose sight of the opposite place, why am I alive?
  Even if I ask, the scenery has no answers

kie wa shinai ano hi no itami
  ima mo kikoeru kimi no kotoba ga
  The pain from that time doesn't diappear
  Even now, I can hear your words

* naite naite naite
  doushite hito wa omoi ga afurederu no?
ikiru mono subete no namida no ame ga
  yagate kawa ni nari  daichi wo kyou mo nagareteru
  I cry & cry & cry; why do people's emotions flow out?
  The rain of tears of the living finally become the rain
  & today it also flows to the earth

hitotsu hitotsu kagayakidasu
  akaneiro no sora no hoshitachi
haruka tooku furusato ni wa
  ima mo boku ga iru
  The stars in the red sky begin to shine one by one
  Even now, I am far away in my hometown

eien nado dare mo motomezu
  mijikasugiru toki wo ikiteru
  No one searches for eternity, 
  they just live a life that's too short

naite naite naite
  doushite hito wa konna ni yowai no darou?
subete no kanashimi ya yorokobi tachi ga
  yagate kawa ni nari  sekai wo kyou mo nagareteru
  I cry & cry & cry; I wonder why people are so weak
  All of the sadness, all of the happiness
  finally becomes a river & it's flowing to the earth today too

yoru e kaeru umidori-tachi yo
  boku no kodoku mo hakonde okure
  The seagulls that return to the night;
  please carry my loneliness away too

* repeat
