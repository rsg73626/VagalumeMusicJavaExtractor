THE GOLDFISH THAT DREAMED

the first goldfish bowl I bought
“a goldfish taken from a festival is weak
so it’ll die soon” someone told me
this morning it was already floating on the surface snoring
while I cried, I placed it softly in the palm of my hand 
daiji ni shiteta  namae mo tsuketa noni naze kashira?
kingyobachi nozoku no kowakatta
kono heya ni watashi igai no inochi no kehai wo
tada sukoshi fuyashitakatta dake yo I was taking care of it, I even gave it a name, so I wonder why?
I was afraid to look in the goldfish bowl
in this room, I just wanted to see
if it was still alive, that’s all! 
ichido mo kuchizuke suru koto wa nakatta
akakute muryoku na ano ko no kuchibiru there wasn’t even a single kiss
that child’s red and powerless lips 
hajimete katta kingyobachi
omatsuri de toreru kingyo wa yowai kara
sugu shinjau tte dareka itteta
kesa mo ibiki minamo ni uita
nakinagara sotto tenohira ni noseta  the first goldfish bowl I bought
“a goldfish taken from a festival is weak
so it’ll die soon” someone told me
this morning it was already floating on the surface snoring
while I cried, I placed it softly in the palm of my hand 
yake ni suzushii  yuuyake ni yoku nita kanashii iro ga
hitori no gogo ni nijinda
kono heya ni sagesunda kuuki dake wo
nokoshite karappo no hachi wa watashi wo warau it’s awfully cool, a sad color that often resembles the sunset
blurred into one person’s afternoon
in this room, only the atmosphere that I despise is left
the empty bowl laughs at me 
nando mo kuchizuke shite okeba yokatta
amari ni hiriki na watashi no kuchibiru many kisses if you give up, it was good
the lips of completely incompetent me 
kitto watashi ga yume wo miteta no
sore wa mada minu michitarita sekai
kangaete wa jitto mune wo kogashiteta
chiisa na karada butsukenagara
hisshi de sou, oyogi samayotte... surely I was dreaming
that’s still a world that’s content
considering it quietly burns my breast
while running into my small body
it’s true that it’s inevitable, paddle about in the water 
hajimete katta kingyobachi
omatsuri de toreru kingyo wa yowai kara
sugu shinjau tte dareka itteta
kesa mo ibiki minamo ni uita
nakinagara sotto tenohira ni noseta  the first goldfish bowl I bought
“a goldfish taken from a festival is weak
so it’ll die soon” someone told me
this morning it was already floating on the surface snoring
while I cried, I placed it softly in the palm of my hand 
watashi ni nokosareta saigo no natsu mo
shizuka ni te wo futta
anata to sugoshita saisho no natsu ga
shizuka ni iki wo tometa the end of summer that could leave me behind
my hand fell quietly
the beginning of summer that passed you and I
I peacefully stopped breathing
