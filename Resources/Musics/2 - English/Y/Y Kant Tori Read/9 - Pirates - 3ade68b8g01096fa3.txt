PIRATES

Traveled Far
From My Home
Foreign Streets
Paved With Stone
Deep In My Dreams
Moroccan Sand
Now I Sail My Ship
On Dry Land

CHORUS:
There Is a Light That
Shines On The Frontier
Pirates Yeah
Pirates
And On A Dark Night
When You Feel Lonely
And The World Just
Can't Understand You
Pirates Yeah
Pirates

Steal The Jewel
Watch it Break
It Cuts With An Eye
I Can't Escape
The Ruby Heals
Alone I Stand
When I Sail My Ship
On Dry Land

CHORUS:
There Is A Light That
Shines On The Frontier
And Baby Someday
We're Gonna Be There
Pirates Yeah
Pirates
And On A Dark Night
When You Feel Lonely
And When the World Just
Can't Understand You
Pirates Yeah
Pirates
There Is A Light That
Shines On The Frontier
Pirates Yeah
Pirates
There Is A Light That
Shines On The Frontier
