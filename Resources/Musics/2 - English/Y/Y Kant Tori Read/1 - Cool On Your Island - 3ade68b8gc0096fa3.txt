COOL ON YOUR ISLAND

COOL ON YOUR ISLAND
If You Don't 
Treat Me Better 
Baby I'll Just Run Away 
Baby I Don't 
Know What Drives You 
To Play All These 
Silly Games 
C'mon Baby 
I'm Much Stronger 
Than You Know 
Sometimes 
I'm Not Afraid 
To let It Show 

CHORUS: 
When Will You Wake Up 
I Want You 
More Than The Stars 
And The Sun 
But I Can Take 
Only So Much 
Cool On Your Island 
Is It Cool On Your Island 

I Gotta Brand New Dress Babe 
Could It 
Make You Wanna Try 
I Guess 
I Didn't Want To Notice 
The Stars Gone 
From Your Eyes 
C'mon Baby 
I'm Much 
Stronger Than You Know 
Sometimes 
I'm Not Afraid 
To let It Show 

REPEAT CHORUS 

We Could Buy 
An Airplane 
Build A Home 
In The Sand 
You Could Tell 
Your Secrets 
I Could Understand 
But Then By The Morning 
Comes Crumblin' Down 
And As Your Leavin' 
Wait 

CHORUS: 
When Will You Wake Up 
I Want You 
More Than The Stars 
And The Sun 
But I Can Take
Only So Much 
Cool On Your Island 
You're So Cool On Your Island 
Is It Cool On Your Island 
Is It Cool Baby 

If You Don't 
Treat Me Better 
Baby I'll Just 
Run Away 
If You Don't 
Treat Me 
One Day 
You'll Wake Up Cold 
Then You'll Know 
You'll Know 
You'll Know
You Love Me
