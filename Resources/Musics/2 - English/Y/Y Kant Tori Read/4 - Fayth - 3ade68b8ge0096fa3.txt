FAYTH

FAYTH
Make It In
The City
Do What You Can
Wave To The Boy
With A Gun
In His Hand

Lolipop Girls
Pave The Street
Stand In Line
To Be
In Your Limousine

You Took My Love
You Took My Money 
You Took My Sex
Took My Love
Took My Money
Give me

CHORUS:
Fayth
Help Me Keep 
Myself Together
With A Little More
Fayth
With A Little More
Fayth Yeah
Fayth
I Could Keep 
Our Love Together
With A Little More
Fayth
I Could Wake Up
And Face The Day

How Do You Keep
The Romance There
When A Little
French Maid
Lives Downstairs

Radio Blasts
As The Baby Cries
Run To The Dragon That
Runs my Life

You Took My Love
You Took My Money
You Took My Sex
Took My Love
Took My Money
Give me

REPEAT CHORUS

I Could Wake Up
And Face The Day
Maybe I Could
Start Again
Why Am I Afraid
Of Change
Maybe Fayth
Could Understand
Darlin' I Remember
When
I Held The Violets
In My Hand
Love Can Crush
Held Too Tight
We Could Bring
It Back Alive
With A Little More
Fayth

REPEAT CHORUS
