THE BIG PICTURE

Someone smashed my window
Broke into my brand new car
Last night
Caught my boyfriend looking
At another slender
Pair of thighs
Gotta make more money
Gotta get gotta get there faster than
The rest
Knock 'em off the ladder
If they even seem to
Stand a chance

The big picture
Gotta big white cloud
The big picture
Is starin' at me
Starin' at me

Why do I feel so threatened
That somebody else will
Take what's mine
Babe it's only rented
No one really owns the
Merchandise
What about what I want
Somehow it got lost somewhere
Inside
My mother's on my case
I told her it's my life
Well, she just died

The big picture
Gotta big white cloud
The big picture
Starin' at me
Starin' at me
The big picture
On a big blank wall
The big picture
Is starin' at me
Starin' at me

When I can see
I'll try again
I've got my paints
The big picture...

The big picture
Gotta big white cloud
The big picture
Starin' at me
Starin' at me
The big picture
On a big blank wall
The big picture
Is starin' at me
Starin' at me
