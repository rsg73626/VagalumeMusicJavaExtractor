FIRE ON THE SIDE

Fire On The Side
Purple Sunset
Orange Moon
I'm Alone Again
Without You
I Knew Someone
Had To Lose

Kiss Goodbye
Go Back To Your Separate Life
That You Have With Her
Ashes Blow
In The Windy Skye
Take My Heart
As You Go

CHORUS:
Baby It Burns
Baby It Burns
Baby It Burns
To Be Your
Fire On The Side
Taste My Tears
See How They Burn
Baby It Burns
To Be Your
Fire On The Side

Purple Sunset
Orange Moon
How Can The
Music Play
When The Only Band
Is Made Of Gold

Wrapped Around
Your Hand
That I
Used To Hold
Against My Chest
Every Night
But I Still
Can Hope
You Will See
I'm Your Home

REPEAT CHORUS

I Knew Someone
Had To Lose
Kiss Goodbye
Go Back To Your Separate Life
You Have With Her
Take My Heart
As You Go

REPEAT CHORUS
