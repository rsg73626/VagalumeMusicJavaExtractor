ETIENNE TRILOGY

maybe i'm a witch
lost in time
running through the fields
of scotland by your side

kicked out of france
but i still believe
taken to a land
far across the sea

CHORUS
etienne
etienne
hear the west wind
whisper my name
etienne
etienne
by the morning
maybe i'll remember
who i am

maybe you're the knight
who saved my life
maybe we faced
the fire side by side

here we are again
under the same sky
as the gypsy crystal
slowly dies

CHORUS
etienne
etienne
hear the west wind
whisper my name
etienne
etienne
by the morning
maybe we'll remember
who i am

i close my eyes
see you again
i know i've held you
but i can't remember
where or when

REPEAT SECOND CHORUS
