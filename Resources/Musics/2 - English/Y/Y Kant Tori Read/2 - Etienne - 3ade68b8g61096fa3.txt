ETIENNE

Maybe I'm a witch lost in time
running through the fields of Scotland by your side
kicked out of France but I still believe
taken to a land far accross the sea

Etienne, Etienne
hear the wind whisper my name
Etienne, Etienne
by the morning maybe we'll rememer who I am

maybe you're the knight who saved my life
maybe we faced the fire side by side
here we are again under the same sky
as the gypsy crystal slowly dies

Etienne, Etienne
hear the west wind whisper my name
Etienne, Etienne
by the morning maybe we'll remember who I am

I close my eyes see you again
I know I've held you but
I can't remember where or when

Etienne, Etienne
hear the west wind whipser my name
Etienne, Etienne
by the morning maybe we'll remember who I am

maybe I'm a witch
