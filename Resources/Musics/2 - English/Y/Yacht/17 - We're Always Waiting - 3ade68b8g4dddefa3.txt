WE'RE ALWAYS WAITING

We're always waiting
What are we waiting for
We've got all we need right here
But something's telling us we need more

We want all that stuff
All that stuff that costs too much

Why are we working?
And what are we working for?

We want all that stuff
All that stuff that costs too much
We feel sad and such
Are we owned by our own stuff?

We want all that stuff
All that stuff that costs too much
We feel sad and such
Are we owned by our own stuff?

We don't want our boring jobs
To keep us paying bills for ever
So what are we waiting for?
(And we wait)
