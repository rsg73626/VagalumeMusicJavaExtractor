TRIPPED & FELL IN LOVE

Bless this hour of meditation
Just us and medication, can't say it ex, ex, ex, ex, explicitly
All my friends became my family
There is an obvious change in me

I tripped and fell in love with you
Honest, you do what I aim to
We looked at each other and our eyes were clear
Love your family, you do well and so sincere

I tripped and fell in love with you
Dance in the light, honest you do
We looked at each other and our eyes were clear
Love your family, you do well and so sincere

I tripped

Entangled in vertigo, here we go
And now you know how I've felt all along
Decadence and charity coming on strong
I told myself I'd never write a love song

We've known each other our whole lives
Under circumstance and sacrifice
Now we're together un-ex, expectedly

All my friends became my family
There is an obvious change in me
