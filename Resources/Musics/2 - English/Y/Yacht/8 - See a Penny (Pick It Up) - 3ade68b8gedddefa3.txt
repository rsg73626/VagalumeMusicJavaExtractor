SEE A PENNY (PICK IT UP)

See a penny pick it up
And all day you'll have good luck
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I cut my fingers on the rock
Bending down to pick it up
(Oh, oh)
I didn't know what to expect
But I guess that's what you get
(Oh, oh)

Without love what do we have?
Without love what do we have?
(Nothing)

See a penny pick it up
And all day you'll have good luck
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

If there's no magic in the world
Then we know just what to do
I just lost 100 bucks
Betting it on
(Something)
Love
(Oh, oh)

Without love what do we have?
Without love what do we have?
Nothing, nothing

See a penny pick it up
And all day you'll have good luck
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
