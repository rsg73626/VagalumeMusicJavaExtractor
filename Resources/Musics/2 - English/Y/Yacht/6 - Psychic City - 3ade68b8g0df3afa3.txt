PSYCHIC CITY

I used to live live in a psychic city,
I never knew what would happen in a day.
I might be looking out the window
And a friend might say,
"Come on over over, come on over over,
Come on over we're having a party for you.
Come on over over, come on over over,
Come on over we're having a party for you."

I used to live in a voodoo city,
Where every little thing had it's own secret life.
I might be washing up the dishes
And the kitchen might say,
"Hang around baby baby, hang around baby baby,
Hang around baby we'll be baking a cake for you.
Hang around baby baby, hang around baby baby,
Hang around baby we'll be baking a cake for you."

I used to live in a heartbeat city,
I swear I'd fall in love every minute on the street.
You might be walking around the corner
And our eyes might meet.
Where you been darling darling? Where you been darling darling?
Where you been darling darling we've been holding this moment for you.
Where you been darling darling? Where you been darling darling?
Where you been darling darling we've been holding this moment for you.

I told you your dreams would come true
I told you your dreams would come true
I told you your dreams would come true
I told you your dreams would come true
