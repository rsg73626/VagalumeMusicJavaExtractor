UTOPIA

We looked into the future
In a visionary state, a psychoactive state
There's nothing in the future
It's up to us to make

Utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia
Utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia
We all know when we wake up
That this is what all we get

This is what we get
Think fondly about life
But still think strongly about death

Utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia
Utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia

A higher source is calling
And you don't have to commit
You don't have to submit
The future works upon us
As we all work upon it

Utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia
Utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia, utopia
