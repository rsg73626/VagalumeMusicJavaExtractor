RUN CHEERFULLY TO THE SUNSET

I wanna go even if I stumble on a stone
I wanna go even if I am snowed up
Run cheerfully to the sunset
Run cheerfully to the sunset

Even if you can't do as you imagined
Even if things don't go as you hoped for
Run cheerfully to the sunset
Run cheerfully to the sunset

I can feel the wind
It helps me to be so honest
I can feel the wind
It helps me to be clear
And I make the wind everyday

Hue, Blowin' in the wind
Hue, The storm has come
