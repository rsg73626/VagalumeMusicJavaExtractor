DYSTOPIA (THE EARTH IS ON FIRE)

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

We are all hungry
We are all tired
Our tongues they are all on fire
The walls that we build are higher, higher, higher, higher, higher...

Strange days lead to strange nights
You aren't afraid of the dark, dark, dark, dark
When it's where you walk, walk, walk, walk
When it's where you learn to talk...

Every day the sky gets lower, lower, lower, lower...
And every day the tide gets blacker, blacker, blacker, blacker...
And every day the flames get higher, higher, higher, higher...
Yeah, every day the flames get higher, higher, higher, higher.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals will return

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals will return

We live like lions
We live our lives
With no more husbands, no more wives
We let our children multiply 'cause we're afraid of dying

Every day the sky gets lower, lower, lower, lower...
And every day the tide gets blacker, blacker, blacker, blacker...
And every day the flames get higher, higher, higher, higher...
Yeah, every day the flames get higher, higher, higher, higher.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals will return

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals will return

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
We don't have no daughter
Let the motherfucker burn.

The Earth, the Earth, the Earth is on fire
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals will return
