I THOUGHT THE FUTURE WOULD BE COOLER

I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the future would be cooler

Crowdsourced cults
All lit up on led
Next thing you know
You're sipping on a battery

Infinitely scroll
Through a swat team on the sidewalk
Serving death by remote control
And unrestricted sidearms

I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the brave world would be newer
I thought the future would be cooler

Loving comes easy
Nothing new
But liking it ain't free
Underneath the sun
We save our face in public
I can't save you
When we erase each other privately
You're already gone

Got my broken heart
I got it sold right back to me
By an algorithmic
Social entity

I thought the future would be cooler
Cool
I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the brave world would be newer
Cool
I thought the future would be cooler

I thought the future would be

Looking for the edge
Of our unrendered world
I don't know what we'll find
Oh, here comes tomorrow!

I thought the future would be cooler
Nothing new
I thought the future would be cooler
Underneath the sun
I thought the brave world would be newer
I can't save you
I thought the future would be cooler
You're already gone

I thought the future would be cooler
Nothing new
I thought the future would be cooler
Underneath the sun
I thought the brave world would be newer
I can't save you
I thought the future would be cooler
It's already gone

I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the future would be cooler
Cooler, cooler, cooler
