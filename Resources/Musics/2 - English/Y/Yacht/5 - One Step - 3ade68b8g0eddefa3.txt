ONE STEP

One step over the line
You're not much over the line
You are fine

Two steps over the line
Still feels okay in your mind
You're still fine

Three steps over the line
Three steps isn't a crime
Not a crime

Four steps over the line
You're beginning to consider
A return to the line

Five steps over the line
One more step
And you can put it behind

Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line

Six steps over the line
Why're we talking about lines?
All you see is forms and colors and designs

Seven steps over the line
Seems like all those steps
They have been in your mind

Eight steps over the line
You're so far gone
Now feeling close to sublime

Nine steps over the line,
Whoa, that last step
Felt like a c-c-crime

Ten steps over the line
Ten steps over the line
Ten steps

And you're mine, and you're mine
And you're mine, and you're mine, and you're mine
And you're mine, and you're mine
And you're mine, and you're mine, and you're mine
