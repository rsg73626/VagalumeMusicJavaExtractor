THE AFTERLIFE

Land of the empire builders, land of Golden West
Conquered and held by free men, fairest and the best
Onward and upward, ever forward on and on
Hail to thee, the land of heroes, yours when dead and gone

Hail to thee, land of heroes
It's all yours when you're dead and gone

The afterlife, hey, we know how to make life go on
The afterlife, death is not the end of this song
The afterlife

Land of the rose and sunshine, land of summer's breeze
Laden with health and vigor, fresh from the western seas
Blessed by the blood of martyrs, land of setting sun
Hail to thee, land of promise, the end of our system

Hail to thee, land of promise
Life at the end of our system

The afterlife inside your own private kingdom
The afterlife, hey, [Incomprehensible]
The afterlife

It's not a place you go, it's a place that comes for you
And it's not about who you know or who's in your heart
It may come as a surprise but you are not alone
All that you have is not what you own

It's not a place you go, it's a place that comes for you
And it's not about who you know or who's in your heart
It may come as a surprise but you are not alone
All that you have is not what you own

It's not a place you go, it's a place that comes for you
And it's not about who you know or who's in your heart
It may come as a surprise but you are not alone
All that you have is not what you own

It's not a place you go, it's a place that comes for you
And it's not about who you know or who's in your heart
It may come as a surprise but you are not alone
All that you have is not what you own
