SHANGRI-LA

I don't want to die and go on off to paradise
There are more fun places here that I can patronize
And you my friend aren't born again
You're dead already

If I can't go to heaven, let me go to L.A.
Or the far west Texas desert or an Oregon summer day
If we build a utopia will you come and stay?
Shangri-la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

St. Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I love my friends in hell, as above and so below
When the rapture comes, if you don't mind
I'll be waiting down here and sweating

If I can't go to heaven let me go to L.A.
Or the far west Texas desert or an Oregon summer day
If we build a utopia will you come and stay?
Shangri-la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Accumulating cumulus in our backyard
My puzzle pieces fooling heaven bit by bit
Beneath this jigsaw sky I sit
And wonder, wonder, wonder where do I fit?

If I can't go to heaven let me go to L.A.
Or the far west Texas desert or an Oregon summer day
If we build a utopia will you come and stay?
Shangri-la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
