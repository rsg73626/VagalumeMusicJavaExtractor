I WALKED ALONE

Oh, the moon goes round the earth
(Earth, earth, earth, earth)
And the moon controls the tide
(Tide, tide, tide, tide)

And the earth goes round the sun
(Sun, sun, sun, sun)
And the sun provides the light
(Light, light, light, light)

And the light makes most of life
If my friends were a crowd
It might not be the biggest
But it'd be deafeningly loud

And if my enemies were an army
They'd try to take us down
Deaf, dumb and proud
Yeah, deaf, dumb and proud
Deaf, dumb and proud, proud, proud, proud, proud

The cat catches the mouse
(Mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse)
And the mouse just wants a home
(Home, home, home, home)

And the dog chases the cat
(Cat, cat, cat, cat)
And the cat wants to be alone
(Lone, lone, lone, lone)

And all the animals have souls
Guiding their bones
Yeah, all the animals have souls
Guiding their bones

If my friends were a drug
Not of them could afford it
But it's already in their blood
And if your enemies caused the cancer

We'd find a cure for you
And bring it to the club
Yeah, bring it to the club
Yeah, bring it to the club, club, club, club, club

I walked alone until we met
Then we, we, we walked against
The earth until we met
Oh you, you, you, I walked alone
Until we met

And we, we walked against
The earth until we met
Oh you, you, you I walked alone

Oh, the moon goes round the earth
(Earth, earth, earth, earth)
And the moon controls the tide
(Tide, tide, tide, tide)

And the earth goes round the sun
(Sun, sun, sun, sun)
And the sun provides the light
(Light, light, light, light)
And the light makes most of life

I walked alone until we met
Then we, we, we walked against
The earth until we met
Oh you, you, you, I walked alone
Until we met

And we, we walked against
The earth until we met
Oh you, you, you I walked alone
