THAT WOULD BE ME

(Tim Hunt/Rick Bowles/David Malloy)
(Track 7 - Time 3:18)

Just imagine a man with no hope, and no faith
Would he believe in true love, well no way
Just going through the motions emotionally
Without you here to show him how good it could be
Oh that would be me, yeah that would be me

Who's the one man walkin' on this earth
Who's knows exactly what your worth
Who's gonna love you for the rest of his life
With every breath he breathes
Oh that would be me, yeah that would be me

A man with a heart, torn and tattered
And every dream he'd dream, just broken and shattered
Lookin' at the world a little too cynically
Without you here to show him how good it could be
Oh, that would be me, that would be me yeah

Who's the one man walkin' on this earth
Who's knows exactly what your worth
Who's gonna love you for the rest of his life
With every breath he breathes
Oh, that would be me, that would be me yeah

Who's the one man walkin' on this earth
Who's knows exactly what your worth
Who's gonna love you for the rest of his life
With every breath he breathes
Oh, that would be me, yeah that would be me
That would be me
