THIS TIME AROUND

(Tim Hunt/Joe Caverlee/Terry Clayton)
(Track 3 - Time 3:57)

She locked the door behind her
And headed out of town
And it don't much matter where she's bound
She left it all except a heart full of memories
And scars you never see, from

Those words he hurt her with and held her down
And the tears that fell without a sound
And she swears it's gonna be different now
This time around

He's taking it step by step and one day at a time
Trying to find the man he was and left behind
Fighting the battle sometimes barely holding on
Now that all he loved is gone, with..

Those words he hurt her with and held her down
And the tears that fell when she walked out
And she swears it's gonna be different now
This time around

He wants the chance to be
The man she used to see in him, before

He wants the chance to be
The man she used to see in him, before

All of tose words he hurt her with and held her down
And the tears that fell without a sound 
And she swears it all will be different now
This time around
This time around
