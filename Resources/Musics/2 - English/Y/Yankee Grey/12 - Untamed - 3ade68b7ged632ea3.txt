UNTAMED

We've done the "porch swing love" so long I can't remember my name
Back and forth nice and slow 'till we get real close and you still want to wait
I'm not sayin that it's a big waste of time
It's been great been a lot of fun
But I'm about to go of like a loaded gun

All I want is a pumped up jacked up screamin' like a mustang
Kick me in my gut thing
Unleashed passion, fingernail scratchin'
Goin' right into a lot of stuff I can't name
What I want is completely untamed

Now you don't have to second guess this thing or try to figure it out
It doesn't matter how, or where, or when, or why
It's gonna happen by itself
How you ever gonna know unless you give it a try
I dare you to just let it go
I bet ya turn into a wild animal

All I want is a pumped up jacked up screamin' like a mustang
Kick me in my gut thing
Unleashed passion, fingernail scratchin'
Goin' right into a lot of stuff I can't name
What I want is completely untamed

A fire cracker ain't what I like
It's gotta blow like dynamite

All I want is a pumped up jacked up screamin' like a mustang
Kick me in my gut thing
Unleashed passion, fingernail scratchin'
Goin' right into a lot of stuff I can't name
What I want is completely untamed
