TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW

(Tim Hunt/Billy Crain)
(Track 10 - Time 3:05)

Your bags are packed sittin' by the door
Your mama's waitin' outside in the car
It won't do no good to try to stop you now
'Cause you think you know for sure

You say good-bye baby don't cry
'Cause this time your walkin' out the door
You'll say you mean it, but honey I've seen it before
So come on tell me somethin' I don't know

You told me once Lord you told me twice
Maybe the third time will be the charm
But the chances are lordy you'll be back
Cryin' wolf again tomorrow

You say good-bye baby don't cry
'Cause this time your walkin' out the door
You'll say you mean it, but honey I've seen it before
So come on tell me something I don't know
Come on tell me something I don't know

You say good-bye baby don't cry
'Cause this time your walkin' out the door
You'll say you mean it but honey I've seen it before
So come on tell me somethin' I don't know
Cme on tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Lord, somethin' I don't know
