TURNS THE PAGE

On a long and lonesome highway,east of them of all 
You can listen to the engine moaning out it's one note song And you think about the one  or the girl the night before  
But your thoughts will soon be wondering the ways they always do  
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do 	
And you don't feel much like ridin'  you just wish the trip was true 


Here I am on the road again, 
There I am one more stage 
Here I go,playin' star again 
there I go turn the page 
			 
Well you're walkin' to a restaurant strung out from the cold  			 
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're chakin' off the coat 
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explose 
Most times you can hear them talkin',other times you can't 
It's the same old preachey is there a woman or a man 
and you always see my thunder so you don't dare they make a stair 


After there in the spot lights you're a million miles away 
Every outs of energy you try to give away  
as the swipe bose from your body like the music that you play 
 

Later in the evening as you lie a waken bed 
Echoes from the ack fires ringing in your head 
And you smoke the day's last cigarette remembering what you said
