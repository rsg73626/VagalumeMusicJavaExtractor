ANOTHER NINE MINUTES

(Tim Douglas/Billy Crain/Tim Buppert)
(Track 2 - Time 3:10)

Six thirty in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day's starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes
Let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I want to stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
Can't eat if we don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Let's pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes
Let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I want to stay in it
For another nine minutes

I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes
Let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I want to stay in it
For another nine minutes
Let the world wait
Whose gonan care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I want to stay in it
