I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL

(Tim Hunt/Josh Leo/Robert Ellis Orrall)
(Track 9 - Time 2:59)

Like a baby tastin' ice cream for the very first time
Like the first jump from an airplane in a free fall dive
Like a roller coaster barely stickin' to the track
Now that you've been in my arms there ain't no turning back

I know how you feel
And I'll never be the same don't wanna be
In less than love this way
Couldn't go without your kissin' 'cause I'd know what I was missin'
And nothin' else will ever be this real
Baby now that I know how you feel

It's the moment when I knew that love was much more than a word
So much sweeter than the sweetest song I've ever heard
It's the answer to the question I've been askin' all my life
And now you're tellin' me your heart was made for mine

I know how you feel
And I'll never be the same don't wanna be
In less than love this way
Couldn't go without your kissin' 'cause I'd know what I was missin'
And nothin' else will ever be this real 
Baby now that I know how you feel

I know how you feel
And I'll never be the same don't wanna be
In less than love this way
Couldn't go without your kissin' 'cause I'd know what I was missin'
And nothin' else could ever be this real
Baby now that I know how you feel
And I'll never be the same don't wanna be
In less than love this way
Couldn't go without your kissin' 'cause I'd know what I was missin'
And nothin' else could ever be this real
Baby now that I know how you feel
