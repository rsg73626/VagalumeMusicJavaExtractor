STAY WITH ME

I don't move damn it [begin]

Stay with me, don't ever leave...
I never thought that we would come this far
After what we've been through
I never asked for anything but love
That's all I need from you

Forever and ever our love would always grow
You'll see, why should've my one love
I don't want you to go

Don't leave, stay with me
I never want you to go I'll always give you my love
And you know it's true
Don't leave stay with me
Together we will always be forever our love will grow
Cause I love you so

Stay with me...
Remember the love we had would come too far
This love between me and you
And they are here right here inside my heart
All memories of me and you

Forever and ever...
Don't leave stay with me...
