THE BEST, MY BEST

she is alone,seeking a safe home
the boy of my dreams,I search
but now is not better place to follow

my heart, i cant do it without you
so far,I still see the moon alone

if I am the rain, you are my best wind again
if I see the moon alone,you dry all my heart

becouse, you are my man
i dont want bad feelings
I will fly without you
but know that my love is true, my love is true

say that i am the only and (to be better, all i want)
maybe my heart beats again
you my best,you the best
you are my love
