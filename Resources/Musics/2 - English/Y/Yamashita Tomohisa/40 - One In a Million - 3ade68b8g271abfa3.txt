ONE IN A MILLION

Itsu kara kimi no kisu wa naozari
Ima moeru touch my mind sugu ni
Darling, why you can’t see my eyes
Baby, are we over ?

Aishiau tame ni iru ability
Kore ijou wa mou nai hodo ability
Baby, do you have another one ?
It might conspire

Cause you’re my one in a million (My one in a million)
Sono mama de believe me
Kimi ga One in a million
Deaeta toki ni Baby, it’s my destiny (Baby, it’s my destiny)

I’m gonna trust in your words till the sun comes up
Waratte yo boku no mae de one more time
One in a million
My one in a million (My one in a million)

Kakujitsu wa by the six sense is super sense
Kimi wo ushinau koto wa another world
I wanna know the reason why [I] could change your mind now

Maniau nara I wanna hold ya
Cause you saw me crying, so lonely soldier
Baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart [in] itself

Cause you’re my one in a million (My one in a million)
Dakara Never say goodbye
Kimi ga One in a million
Dakiau tabi ni baby, it’s my destiny (Baby, it’s my destiny)

I’m gonna trust in your words till the sun comes up
I’m gonna hunt you down, come day or night
One in a million
My one in a million (My one in a million)

Unmei to omoi wa toki wo koete
Eien no saiai wo mata michibiku kara
Be my one in a million
Kimi shika inai kara here we go

Cause you’re my one in a million (My one in a million)
Sono mama de believe me
Kimi ga One in a million
Deaeta toki ni baby, it’s my destiny (Baby, it’s my destiny)

I’m gonna trust in your words till the sun comes up
I’m gonna hunt you down, come day or night
One in a million
My one in a million (My one in a million)
