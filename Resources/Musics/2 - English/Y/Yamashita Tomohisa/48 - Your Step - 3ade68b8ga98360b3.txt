YOUR STEP

Tell me whatcha like
And all the things you don't
Crazy, there's so many things I still don't know
There's a few little things
You've not discovered yet
About the me, in front of you
You haven't met

So just go let it out
You can go your way
Just do it now
We can make the world go round and round
Let me hear you shout
Come on celebrate
You and I can change the world today

All the dreams that
I've tucked away inside my heart
Feels like when I'm here with you
They're about to start
Don't be shy to shine your light on everyone
Can't you see your smile is brighter than the sun
So just go let it out

You can go your way
Just do it now
We can make the world go round and round
Let me hear you shout
Come on celebrate
You and I can change the world today

Hear the storm calling
We'll make it through if we pull through together
Standing so tall
Nothing can stop us
Now that we know how to fly

You can go your way
Just do it now
We can make the world go round and round
Let me hear you shout
Come on celebrate
You and I can change the world today
