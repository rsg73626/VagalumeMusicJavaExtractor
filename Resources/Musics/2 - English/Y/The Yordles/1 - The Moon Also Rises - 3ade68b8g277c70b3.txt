THE MOON ALSO RISES

A new moon is rising
They leave me no choice
Bring down the sun
They would not listen
Blind to the truth
Eclipse the sun

Face the night
Let the moon fall
The time is nigh
Feel the moonlight
In the night sky

Shine
I am the chosen
I purge blight
My eyes are open
I follow no false
Light

They could not break
I speak only truth
I will be heard
Called me a heretic
But I'll prove them wrong
The sun is blinding

Face the night
Let the moon fall
The time is nigh
Feel the moonlight
In the night sky
Shine
I am the chosen
I purge blight
My eyes are open
I follow no false
Light

I can feel the light
(I can feel the light)
See the sunlight burn
All those who follow false hope

Chosen of the moon
(Chosen of the moon)
Silver blade is drawn to
Those who follow blindly

Let the moon fall
The time is nigh
Feel the moonlight
In the night sky
Shine
I am the chosen
I purge blight
My eyes are open
I follow no false
Light

Can't you see the sun is rising
Solar flare eclipse is shining
Bright
