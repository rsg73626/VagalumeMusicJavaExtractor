DON'T FIGHT THE FEELING

When the change is comin' on
It hits you like a hammer
A feelin' I don't understand
I feel it gettin' out of hand
Just remember who you are
Before you're torn to pieces
Slow down, start countin' to ten

Girl, don't fight the feeling
Whatever you do
Keep on breathin' nice and easy
When it's comin' over you
Please, don't fight the feeling
Just go for the ride
I'll be all right

Use your natural instincts
Your woman's intuition
I'll never set my mind at ease
If you listen to your heart
The rest will surely follow
Slow down, girl, I'm tellin' you

Girl, there is/I need a better way
You/I can make it through okay
If you/I just do what I say
Just remember girl

I'll be all right
Use your natural instincts
I remember
You'll be all right
So nice and easy
