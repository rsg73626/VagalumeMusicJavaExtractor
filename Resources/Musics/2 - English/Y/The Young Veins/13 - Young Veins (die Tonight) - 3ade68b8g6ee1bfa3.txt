YOUNG VEINS (DIE TONIGHT)

is "young" a word for "dumb"?
a word for "fun"?
we have the time of our lives
every night like its our job
to lose our minds

every night
but if i were to die tonight
would you cry or deny
my place in your life?
im aware that youre scared
of my heart
but its here

is "young" a word for "dumb"?
a word for "fun"?
we have the time of our lives
every night like its our job
to lose our minds

every night is the same
go to sleep without blame
and the shame is enough to separate us
but we cant help ourselves
were in love
and it really hurts when its wrong

is "young" a word for "dumb"?
a word for "fun"?
we have the time of our lives
every night
like its our job to lose our minds

and its every night
we have the time
like its our job
to lose our minds
every night
