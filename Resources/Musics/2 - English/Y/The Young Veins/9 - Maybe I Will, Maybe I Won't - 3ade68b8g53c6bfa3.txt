MAYBE I WILL, MAYBE I WON'T

Maybe I will, maybe I won't
I don't wanna find my home
I just wonder what happened to it
My hands all caught in stones
Who stole all my bones?
All my forgotten poems

All a joke
What do I know what do I know
Doesn't it show, people get old
When  they're alone?

Maybe I will, maybe I won't

Seven days over the sea shells
Sung so many, he means well
You come visit me
Find me by the sea
Swim around in dreams
Stay afloat
Maybe he will, maybe he won't
Doesn't it show, people get old
When they're alone?

Maybe I will, maybe I won't
Maybe I will, maybe I won't

The weather is impeccable
We're riding to a festival
When suddenly it's gray
Do not be afraid
For the wind it doesn't stay
It blows and goes away
It blows and goes but never shows its face

Doesn't it show, people get old
When  they're alone?
What do I know
Maybe I will, maybe I won't

Maybe I will, maybe I won't (maybe I will, maybe I won't)
Maybe I will, maybe I won't (maybe I will, maybe I won't)
Maybe I will, maybe I won't (maybe I will, maybe I won't)
