CAPE TOWN

Took you in the vineyard
A couple hours after I met you
I didn’t need my passport
Said I’d let you keep it forever
I hardly knew a thing about you
I got lost in Cape Town
In Cape Town
I saw you, I met you, I loved you, I left you
In Cape Town
Woke me in the morning
Asked me if I meant it (I didn’t)
Asked to be her husband
She already had one (In prison)
I hardly knew a thing about you
I got lost in Cape Town
In Cape Town
I saw you, I met you, I loved you, I left you
In Cape Town
In Cape Town
Ran a lot of paper
Lost it all in [part two]
When I was in Asia, I forgot how to call you
Went out to a graveyard to bum a couple flowers
To give to you
When I got back to Cape Town
To Cape Town
