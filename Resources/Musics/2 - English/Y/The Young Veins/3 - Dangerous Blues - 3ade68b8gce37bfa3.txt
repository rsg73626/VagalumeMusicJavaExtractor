DANGEROUS BLUES

All I do is lie
By the ocean side
Why do the clouds all turn grays for you
I've never bloomed such a beautiful blues

Step outside your door
And go down to the shore
Why do your eyes feel like shells in the dune
What makes a crowd turn away from a tune?

I've never bloomed such a beautiful blues

Even the tide gets high at night
And even the truth is wrong sometimes

All I want to do is dig a hole with you
Feet are no strangers to the undertow
We won't decide which way to go

But we will never leave
You're all that's left for me
This is a home, we just don't have a door
Euphoria is at risk on the floor

The words keep on crawling on under the rug
Who knew that love was a dangerous drug?

Even the tide gets high at night
And even the truth is wrong sometimes
Sometimes

You knew that love was a beautiful blues
Who knew that love was a dangerous drug?
Now I know love is a beautiful drug
I know now drugs are a dangerous love
I know now love is a dangerous blues
(Life is unfair)
