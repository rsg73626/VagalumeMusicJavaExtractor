DEFIANCE

There was a hold-up when we found the bridge
Of a place we’d never been
Defiance
And ever since I was a kid
They said just stay away from there
Boy don’t you ever live
In defiance
Defiance, yeah
And from the outside looking in
I sure do make an easy target
It’s nice to think that you are always wanted
And I’m not afraid to laugh
And I don’t mind taking a photograph
Cause you don’t ask for my autograph
In defiance
Defiance
Yet she said it was rusted [lead]
Their love could never live again
But they found a way to make it stay
In defiance she asked
In defiance, she asked
"Why can’t we just be friends?"
This kind of thing always happens
I fell in love again
With defiance and defiance
And defiance, yeah
Defiance
Defiance
Defiance
