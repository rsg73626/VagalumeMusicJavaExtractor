LIE TO THE TRUTH

When I start it out
Writing you this song
I was heels over head in love
But you had your doubts
'Cause you took too long
To finally see what I
What I'd been doing wrong

I tried to love you but
You still love him so
I'll ignore my heart and lie to the truth
I'll lie to the truth

A love of mine once said
"The best part about you
Was me" so now who
Is judging who?
I know I've broke your heart
Mine is broken too
Now if we're even
Why are we both blue?

I tried to be true but
You still love him so
I'll lie in silence and feel like a fool
I lied to the truth

I think that I have had enough
I guess that I have had enough of you
I think that I have had enough
I know that I've finally had enough of you

We tried to be true but
You still loved him so
I'll keep my distance and lie to the truth
I lied to the truth
I'll lie to the truth 'cause you lied to it too
