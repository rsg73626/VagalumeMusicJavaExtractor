CHANGE

She was acting pretty
Thought she owned the city
Someone should have told her
That pretty ain't a job
Now she begs for money
No one calls her honey
As she bothers shoppers in the parking lot

Gets her karma with a catch
Forget superstition by wearing it backwards
Lives under ladders and sleeps with black cats

Some people never change, they just stay the same way
I swear this like a sailor
Love is not a favor
I found is just a concept 
That we live inside
If you can agree with me and Mr. Twain
In matters of opinion our rivals are insane

Forget superstition by wearing it backwards
Lives under ladders and sleeps with black cats
Some people never change, they just stay the same way
(x3)

Change change change (x4)
