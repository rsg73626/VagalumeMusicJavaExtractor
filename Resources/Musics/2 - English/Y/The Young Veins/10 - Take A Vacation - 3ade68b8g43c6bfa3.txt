TAKE A VACATION

I need to take a vacation 
If this is settling down 
Then why aren't you here? 
I want a big celebration 
The night we get back in town 
And I hope you're all there 

Leave the waves in the ocean
Keep it all in the picture
And leave the cold where we came from
Our loneliness will keep us warm
We're going going going very far

I need to take a vacation 
If this is settling down 
Then why aren't you here? 
I want a big celebration 
The night we get back in town 
And I hope you're all there 

Leave the past out to pasture
And take the days as they come
And leave the sand in the suitcase
Just so we don't forget the fun
We're going going going very far
We're going going going very far

I need to take a vacation 
If this is settling down 
Then why aren't you here? 
I want a big celebration 
The night we get back in town 

And I hope you're all there
And I hope you're all there
And I hope you're all there
