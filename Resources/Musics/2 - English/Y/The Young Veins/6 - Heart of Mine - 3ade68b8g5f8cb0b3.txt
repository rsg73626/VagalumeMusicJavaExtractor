HEART OF MINE

If I could ask for anything
I'd only want my girl
I've seen a lot of things
Going on all around the world

I had to leave her all alone
I wrote this down
So I could let her know
That I only want to see her

You should take this heart of mine
She always had that heart of mine
(Always had that heart of mine x2)

If I could win the lottery
We'd sail across the world
Travel to the Philippines
To buy an island just for you and me

Girls on the Equator
Never even compare
I only want to see her

You should take this heart of mine
She always had that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine
She always had that heart of mine
(Always had that heart of mine x2)

You should take this heart of mine
She always had that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine
She always had that heart of mine
(Always had that heart of mine x3)
