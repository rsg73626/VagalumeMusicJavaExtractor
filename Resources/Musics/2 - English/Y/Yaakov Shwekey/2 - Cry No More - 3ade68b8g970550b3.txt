CRY NO MORE

Many tears have fallen, many years were calling
Please no more
Many broken-hearted, friends lost and departed
Please no more

Now the time has come, everyone must stand together
And be strong forever more

Young and helpless children, illness and confusion
Please no more
Old and lonely people, hunger, war and evil
Please no more

Now the time has come, everyone as one forever
Let his kingdom rise again

Cry no more Yerushalyim
Shine once more Yerushalyim
We need to see you proud again
Upon the mountain of Hashem
Then we'll cry no more Yerushalyim

Enemies of freedom, hatred without reason
Please no more
Weapons of destruction, terror and corruption
Please no more
Now the time has come, return and stay this time forever
Let His glory shine again

[2 Times]
Cry no more Yerushalyim
Shine once more Yerushalyim
We need to see you proud again
Upon the mountain of Hashem
Then we'll cry no more Yerushalyim

Cry No More
