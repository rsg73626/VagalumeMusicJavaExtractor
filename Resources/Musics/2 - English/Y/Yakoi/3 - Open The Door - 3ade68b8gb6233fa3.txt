OPEN THE DOOR

Trying to walk 
Where it does not have ways 
Trying to find 
Where ablank space does not have vestiges 
In its heart one space in write
Trying to find
Somebody pra to cease if pranto

It opens the door of its heart 
I find that somebody wants to enter 
Opens the door of its heart
Leaves Jesus in it to inhabit

It does not enter if you not to leave 
It extend to the hand if you to it not to reach
