LOVE MINORITY

I wanna say "yuujou" demo itsuka wa love again ?
You say "kono aijou" tokku ni fallin' love again ?
Isogazu ni baby, take tooku no machi made
I wanna say good boy tanoshimou yo here we go !

I am in best condition
I don't mind, that is my life
I take akaruku miteru yo mirai

It would be fun, baby I will take it.
Itsuka mita aoi hikari
Kurayami can't you see ? can't you see ?
Tesaguri can you feel ? can you feel ?

It's gonna be fun, baby ai no teigi
Itsuka mita ano shiranami
Minna de yoru no umi wo hashitte warai korogeta yo ne

I wanna see genjou kono kankei never end ?
You say "I don't know" futari wa never failing ?
Aserazu ni go in ashita mo ai ni kite
You say dou daro ima no kimochi let me know

I must be going now demo
Iwanai de mada "see you"
Just give me sono ai sorosoro hoshii...

It would be fun, baby I will take it.
Itsuka mita aoi hikari
Kurayami can't you see ? can't you see ?
Tesaguri can you feel ? can you feel ?

It's gonna be fun, baby ai no teiki
Itsuka mita sono scene of beauty
Now you so good mukashi yori mo.
Kore nara I will do anything for you...

It would be fun, baby I will take it.
Itsuka mita aoi hikari
Kurayami can't you see ? can't you see ?
Tesaguri can you feel ? can you feel ?

It's paradise baby ai no teigi
Mieso de misenaku naru
Taerarenakute potsuri
"sorosoro te wo tsunai de... "

Itsuka todaesou ai no teigi
Kizukareta watashi no koi
Ima nara chikaiaeru ?
Korekara I will do anything for you...

Kimi wo shinjite ii no
Wakarazu "tell me why"

Chikaku ni atte taisetsu na mono
Mitsuketa ? holy love
