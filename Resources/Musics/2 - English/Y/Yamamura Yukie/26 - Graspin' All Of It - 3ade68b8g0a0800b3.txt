GRASPIN' ALL OF IT

Way that you talk's a little bit adjusted
What is really up tonight ?

Seein' that you're just a little pity bastard
What is really up tonight ?

I've got a hunch you really got it messed up
I may decide to kill based on whatcha got to say

Grasping all of it
Grasping all of what you say
I alone can take in all that you say

Way that you move's a little artificial
What is really up tonight ?

Seein' that you're just a little superficial
What is really up tonight ?

Not gonna say a thing, and let you stay dumb
Lies give away this way speak on whatcha got to say ?

Grasping all of it
Grasping all of what you say
I alone can take in all that you say

Love love, see through all your lies
Love love, see through all your lies
