HUMAN NATURE

The system is faulty the cracks have appeared,
This life you ve believed in is broken and pierced
And all that you ve dreamed of just walked out the door,
The day that you longed for
It will it will it will never appear

Its all human nature
Just like before
The strong they will reap it
And the meek they stay poor

This fire that i've started
Grows stonger each day
But i can't control it
It finds it own way

Will we ever, find the secret
To this thing that we call life
Thing that we call life

ItÂ«s all human nature
Just like before
The strong they will reap it
And the meek they stay poor

It's all human nature
Just like before
The strong they will reap it
And the meek they stay poor
