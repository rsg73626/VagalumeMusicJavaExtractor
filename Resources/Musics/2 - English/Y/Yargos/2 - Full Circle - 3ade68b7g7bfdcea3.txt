FULL CIRCLE

And the life that i have known has come full circle over once again
A picture that i've painted just to rub it out and start it over again
This mountain that im climbing never seems to have an end
I'm my own worst enemy my friend

These are the days that i've lived
Can't believe whats going wrong
This is the end of the race
You loose
I'm starting all again from the begining

And the garden that sowed has started growing wild once again
It's all coming down on me my friend

These are the days that i've lived
Can't believe whats going wrong
This is the end of the race
You loose

As the universe grows old i've come full circle over once again
A world that iÂ«ve created just to let it die and start to wither my friend

These are the days that i've lived
Can't believe whats going wrong
This is the end of the race
You loose
These are the days that i've lived
Can't believe whats going wrong
This is the end of the race
You loose
