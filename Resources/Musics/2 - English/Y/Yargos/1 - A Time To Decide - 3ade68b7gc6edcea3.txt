A TIME TO DECIDE

Questions more than one man has earned
Why the scales tip why the tide turns
Still iÂ«m over over and again
The situation is getting stronger
Nothing meek another wonder
Think im going then im going down

Chourus

A time to decide what's right
A light to guide us through this night
To know when its over
To sleep for a thousand nights
And wake with a heart that's light
To know where we go there

Now im young and life's so easy
Everybody's trying to teach me
How to grow up be the perfect child
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up

Now im old and what they made me
Generatsions part so easy
Now it's my turn to control the child
But the child in me says no

A time to decide what's right
A light to guide us through this night
To know when its over
To sleep for a thousand nights
And wake with a heart that's light
To know where we go there

Chourus

A time to decide what's right
A light to guide us through this night
To know when its over
To sleep for a thousand nights
And wake with a heart that's light
To know where we go there
