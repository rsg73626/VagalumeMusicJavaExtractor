TURN AWAY

The long and lonely night, that i have always known will come
Demons in my life,the dreams that i had
Down down down
I have always tried, to do my best at every thing
I will always fight,the dreams that i have
Down down down
What about all the things i«ve done

Turn away, but i must stay
Walk away, but i'll not stray
Yearn and sway, from all the pain

You must learn how it feels

Turn away, but i must stay
Walk away, but i'll not stray
Yearn and sway, from all the pain

You have learned how to feel
You have given everything
Your demons are revealed

Still i'm falling, the tree is calling
Me i am the future of my land
Day is dawning i am born again
Cos me i am the future of my land

Turn away, but i must stay
Walk away, but i'll not stray
Yearn and sway, from all the pain
Turn away, but i must stay
Walk away, but i'll not stray
Yearn and sway, from all the pain

Time to decide it, why you deny me
Watching from the side you`re just another man
Will you hold on till tomorrow
Now there is no one to be by your side
Now you deny it the hour of the blind man
Bring to society life, see your heros
Share the tears, now you`re hanging there in no mans land

Still i«m falling, the tree is calling
Me i am the future of my land
Day is dawning i am born again
Cause me, i am the future of my land
