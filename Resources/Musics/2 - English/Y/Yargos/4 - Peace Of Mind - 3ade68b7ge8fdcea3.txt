PEACE OF MIND

Longing for the day when i find some peace of mind
Often gone astray wandered slightly from the line
Trying hard to find find some reason to my life
Through the mists of time where will my journey lead me

Nothing they can do will stop me trying
Slipping sliding constant fighting
Always on the move but going nowhere
Nothing i can do but try to right it
In the end i know i'll find it

Got to change the way
Got to change the way
Find a better day
Bring some meaning to my life
Lonely and afraid
Lonely and afraid
Afraid to face up to my needs

Nothing they can do will stop me trying
Slipping sliding constant fighting
Always on the move but going nowhere
Nothing i can do but try to right it
In the end i know i'll find it

Nothing they can do will stop me trying
Slipping sliding constant fighting
Always on the move but going nowhere
Nothing i can do but try to right it
In the end i know i'll find it
