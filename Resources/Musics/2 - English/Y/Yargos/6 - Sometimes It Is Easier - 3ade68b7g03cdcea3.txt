SOMETIMES IT IS EASIER

Just a man not old but i`m no longer young
A helping hand, squeezing me sensless
Pulling me apart pulling me down
Pull me down
Down to where my demons still are real
Down where they dwell
Down where the are real
Down where they dwell
My personal, hell

Here i stand holding on to what is gone
The promised land
Slipped through my fingers
Tired of holding on
The only one
But now i'm gone and no one's
Left to try to save me

Sometimes it's easier
Just to walk away
But sometimes we take the things
We wanna throw away
Sometimes it's easier
Just to walk away
But sometimes we take the things
We wanna throw away

Down where they dwell
Down where they are real
Down where they dwell
They dwell
My personal hell

Ten times done
A thousand times been washed away
I thought i'd grown
The memories still lingers

Harder holding on
The only one
But now i'm gone and no one's left to try to save me

Sometimes it's easier
Just to walk away
But sometimes we take the things
We wanna throw away
Sometimes it's easier
Just to walk away
But sometimes we take the things
We wanna throw away
