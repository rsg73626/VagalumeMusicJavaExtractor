THE GUILDED CAGE

And if i said i'd throw it all away
Would you believe won't make no difference anyway
The road that we w√°lk
Sometimes it's hard and it takes
Longer than i
Longer than i am prepared to wait
Anything nothing will change

Every day we pay the price
This cage called paradise
The perfect dream the perfect life
In which life will we see we have no choice
Everyday we pay the pries a guilded cage called paradise
If only you could know

Youre not the only one that`s pointing to the sky

How many years how many wasted dreams
Only to find it`s all beyond my means
The path that we take
I know it`s allways the same
Theres nothing that that,
I nothing that we would not try
If we thought we could just change

Every day we pay the price
This cage called paradise
The perfect dream the perfect life
In which life will we see we have no choice
Everyday we pay the pries a guilded cage called paradise
If only you could know

If only if only if only if only you could know
Youre not the only one thats pointing to the sky

Every day we pay the price
This cage called paradise
The perfect dream the perfect life
In which life will we see we have no choice
Everyday we pay the price a guilded cage called paradise
If only you could know
