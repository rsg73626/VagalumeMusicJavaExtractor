POINT OF NO RETURN

When the sails are set
And the wind is blowing
Will anyone remember the ones we left behind

When the sails are set
And the wind is blowing
Will anyone remember the ones we left behind
And the dreams we had

We sailed away with the sun behind our backs
By saving every penny gave to just find any one way out of here

To bring me home
A place where i belong
I know my heart is strong
A reason to survive

I will try - try to make a go
Even no one here around has feet on solid ground
To bring me home
Back home
A place where i belong
I know my heart is strong
A reason to survive

To bring me home
A place where i belong
I know my heart is strong
A reason to survive

Reason to survive

No return
Keep on looking forward
No return
Everything will be forgiven
And now it`s time to find the life iÂ«ve dreamed of
Show me how to live how to survive

There is no way there is no way out here
No return

There is no way there is no way out here
No return
And now it's time to find the life i've dreamed of
Show me what to do how to begin

Now we are here in this foreign land
The land of milk and honey
Dreams instead of money
The point of no return

One home the place where i belong
I know my heart is strong
A reason to survive

One home the place where i belong
I know my heart is strong
A reason to survive

And we sailed away with the sun behind our backs
And know we are here
In this foreign land
It's dead
The point of no return
