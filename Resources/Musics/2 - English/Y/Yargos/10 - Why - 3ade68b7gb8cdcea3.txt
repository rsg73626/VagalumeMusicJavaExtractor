WHY

The teachers that have always taught us now reap their own mistakes
The wings that they've taken from us
No longer hold the ice upon they skate

The waters rising now it's all too late

There`s no one to pull them out
Not a soul to pull them out
And now they sit and suffer
For their own pride
Falling down again

Why can`t you see what`s in front of you
Open your eyes and just let them do
All the things you wanted to believe in
All the things you wanted to be

Why can`t you see what`s in front of you
Open your eyes and just let them do
All the things you wanted to believe in
All the things you wanted to be

The walls that we've built around us
Grow higher and higher each day
The road that we've laid before us
Cant find the true path the stones that we have layed

The weathers turning we cannot win
And who will survive the change
And none of them can survive the change
And now they sit and suffer

Why can`t you see what`s in front of you
Open your eyes and just let them do
All the things you wanted to believe in
All the things you wanted to be
