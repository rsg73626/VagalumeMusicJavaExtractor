TIME DROPS

Sitting here terrified feeling lonely and cursed
Looking down wondering what's going on in this world we`re in
Better to say in this world i've been

All i see are time drops
Like the tears in my eyes
Time drops
Time drops, like the tears that i cry
Time drops

Now that itÂ«s all over i can finally look back
No animosity just the brutal facts
That go on and on and on
These brief moments that have made up my life
Once glued together and now i'm finally free and know i know

Time drops
Like the tears that i cry
Time drops
Time drops, in the blink of an eye
Time drops

Life is wasted on the living youth is too good for the young
Now i know just what's going on,in this world we're in
Better to say in this world i've been
We were all to busy running
Just to see how far we'd come
Go find a way to see
Don't be scared to ask it's not wrong
It's not wrong it's not wrong
It's time you realized you can't be scared forever
Then you`re finally free and then you know

Time drops
Like the tears that i cry
Time drops
Time drops,in the blink of an eye
Time drops
