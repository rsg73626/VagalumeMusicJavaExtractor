WHERE YOU GO

Over and under, every where you go
You are my song, every note I will follow

Tell me your secrets, I'll keep em' close to my heart
Every high every low, who knew power could take us apart
Give me your story, I'll give you mine

Don't care where we're going, anywhere you are, will do
Don't need nothing else, as long as I'm here with you

Feeling your heart beat, holding the rhythm close
Knowing you're happy changes the entire scope
Give me your story, I'll give you mine

Don't care where we're going, anywhere you are, will do
Don't need nothing else, as long as I'm here with you
Don't care where we're going, anywhere you are, will do
Don't need nothing else, as long as I'm here with you
