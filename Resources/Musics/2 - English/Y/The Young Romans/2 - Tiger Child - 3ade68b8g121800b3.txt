TIGER CHILD

You are a tiger
Walked in your line of sight
I started running
But you just take your time
Wait 'till I tire out
Wait 'till I tire out

You are a fire
Tearing across the plain
You're on my heels now
Don't even know your name
But you're gunna hunt me down
You're gunna hunt me down

Tonight
I'm not gunna fight
Just wanna be the victim of your fire
Burning bright tonight
No this ain't my style
But there's a way about your love that's got me feeling wild
My tiger
My tiger child

You are a tiger
Walked in your line of sight
I started running
But you just take your time
Wait 'till I tire out
Cause you're gunna hunt me down

Tonight
I'm not gunna fight
Just wanna be the victim of your fire
Burning bright tonight
No this ain't my style, no
But there's a way about your love that's got me feeling wild
My tiger
My tiger child

My tiger
My tiger child
