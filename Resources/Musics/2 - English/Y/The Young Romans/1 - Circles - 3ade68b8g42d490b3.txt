CIRCLES

You came like a cloud
Covered every doubt
Didn't even notice
That the sun was fading out

Smiling
Will only save us for a while
And wishing
Won't hide what we're missing

Yeah, I love you
But I shouldn't have said it yet
And I know you feel it too
But I was never good at playing hard to get
If we can find a way to start the chase again
We might rediscover love when
We circle 'round the bend

Now we're facing a new year
But it's feeling older than it should
I don't want to pull back any further
But you're not letting me closer to make it good

Smiling
Will only save us for a while
And wishing
Won't hide what we're missing, yeah

Yeah, I love you
But I should't have said it yet
And I know you feel it too
But I was never good at playing hard to get
If we could find a way to start the chase again
We might rediscover love when
we circle 'round the bend
Around the bend

Yeah, I love you
But I shouldn't have said it yet
And I know you feel it too
But I was never good at playing hard to get

Yeah, I love you
But I shouldn't have said it yet
And I know you feel it too
But I was never good at playing hard to get
If we can find a way to start the chase again
We might rediscover love when
We circle 'round the bend
We might rediscover love when
We circle 'round the bend
