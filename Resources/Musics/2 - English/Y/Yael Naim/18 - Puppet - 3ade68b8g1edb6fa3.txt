PUPPET

(Hums in the beginning)

Into another day
They open the box and play
Watching me turning round and round till music slows down and fade
I am a ballerin dancing for silver string
I should never have listened to promises for my dreams
Hey son no matter what they'll say go far away(x2)

My love
And into another day
They open the box and play
Watching me turning round and round till music slows down and fade
Hey son no matter what they'll say go far away(x4)
My love
