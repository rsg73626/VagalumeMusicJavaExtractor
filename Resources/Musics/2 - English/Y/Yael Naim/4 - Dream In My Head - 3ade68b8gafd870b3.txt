DREAM IN MY HEAD

I got a dream in my head
Just waiting for the day
Just waiting for the day
To be born

I got a seed in my hand
Just looking for a way
Just looking for a way
To grow strong

I cross the water
I cross the land
I let all the people
Leave me blind

I search for answers
Wanting to find
A way to reveal
what lies we hide

I have the strongest feeling that I should try
I got to know myself, now I could cry
This is the end of pretending now I know why
I have to lose myself, I no longer try to hide

I've got a story to tell

Just waiting for the day
Just waiting for the day
To be told

I got this anger and pain
Just waiting for my shame
Just for waiting for my blame
To get old

I saw some children playing with guns
I can't believe what we've become
I found some letter written by god
They where signed with our own blood

I have this strongest feeling that I decide
I got to know myself, now I could die
This is the end of my wait and maybe to lie
I might prove myself, but no longer need to hide

So I might prove myself
I no longer no longer need to hide

I have this strongest feeling that I decide
I've come to know me better, now I could die
This is the end of the wait and maybe to lie
I might lose myself
I no longer need no longer need
No longer need
I no longer need to hide
