COME HOME

I'm flying far away to be really free 
Tired hard to build myselfindependantly
Ut's hard to always do what you expect from me
Saying come home
Come home
 
I try to understand why it hurts you 
To see a difference in our points of view
Don't blame me for a thing that i didn't do saying come home
Come home
 
It's insane 
How feeling so much shame Will only bring you pain
And i no longer know how to explain
See i'm happy as can be
And you're my family, my ground 
And i'm just hoping one day I will find you
 
You're holding back the tears when you kiss me
Smile smile when i'm back again as you see me
When yeras are passing by and you misse me
You're saying come home
Come home
 
Such a shame
You're feeling so much blame And yet i'm still the same
 And i no longer know how to explian
 See i'm grateful as can be 
'Cause your my family, i'm bound 
And i'm just hoping one day 
you will shine trough
 
Let's try to look at each other 
Find one other 
Asking how can it be fighting out all that we see
 Is just not always what is real
 
That you come home
 Come home
 Just come home 
Come home 
My turn to understand what you lived trough
 Today i only feel how i miss you so it's only fare, 
when it's hard to bare 
and you ask if i, i try to come home
 Come home
