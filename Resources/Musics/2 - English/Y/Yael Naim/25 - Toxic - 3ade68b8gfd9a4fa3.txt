TOXIC

Baby, can't you see?
I'm calling.
A guy like you,
Should wear a warning.
It's dangerous,
I'm falling.

There's no escape,
I can't wait.
I need a hit,
Baby, give me it.
You're dangerous,
I'm loving it.

Too high, can't come down.
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round.
Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips,
I'm on a ride.
You're toxic,
I'm slipping under.
With a taste of your poison,
Paradise.
I'm addicted to you,
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do,
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late,
To give you up.
I took a sip,
From my devil's cup.
Slowly,
It's taking over me.

Too high, can't come down.
It's in the air and it's all around.
Can you feel it now?

With the taste of your lips,
I'm on a ride.
You're toxic,
I'm slipping under.
With a taste of your poison,
Paradise.
I'm addicted to you,
Don't you know that you're toxic?


Intoxicate me now,
With your loving now,
I think I'm ready now.
(I think I'm ready now).
Intoxicate me now,
With your loving now,
I think I'm ready now.
(I think I'm ready now).
Intoxicate me now,
(Intoxicate me now)
With your loving now,
I think I'm ready now.
(I think I'm ready now).
Intoxicate me now.

Now,
Now,
With the taste of your lips,
I'm on a ride.
