SILENCE

Went back home last night like everyday
I opened the door and found them sitting 
Together, together, together
With their lies glued to the picture box
Though they could see me they just looked through me

It's been years since they stopped trying
To understand their own flesh and blood
My mother thinks I'm useless, my father thinks much worse
I'm not the kind of child they've always wanted

And I hear silence in this cold, cold house
I can see light through their life, but I can't find love
And I hear silence in this cold, cold house
I can see light through their life, but I can't find love

Oh, guy, tell me why
I don't believe in you anymore?
And I'd like to believe in something if I only just could
But now I cannot even trust myself

Cuz hear silence in this cold, cold house
I can see light through their life, but I can't find love
And I hear silence in this cold, cold house
I can see light through their life, but I can't find love

Cuz hear silence in this cold, cold house
I can see light through their life, but I can't find love
