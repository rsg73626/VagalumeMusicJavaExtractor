I WALK UNTIL

I walk until, I walk on teardrops
I walk until you grow
I walk until, I walk on tip toes
I feel like I'm starting down an endless road

I walk until, I walk on teardrops
I walk until you grow
I walk until, I walk on tip toes
I feel like I'm looking out beyond the wall

I walk until I'll stop myself
I see the times change, but I remain
I wake up by myself, go to sleep by myself

I walk until it wants to destroy me
I forgot to how to enjoy
Walk until I feel that I'm falling down
I'm walking cause I don't belong

I walk until, I walk on teardrops
I walk until I know
I walk until, I walk on tip toes
I walk until I understand it all

I walk until I'm tall
I walk until I fall
I walk until, I walk on tip toes
I walk until my body starts to flow

And I have cheated myself but
I want to tell you what you see is never all
I want to feel it, I want to know
I wanted to recall

This time I'm gonna be myself
I've gotta stand up when I feel down
When you I feel down
Walking somewhere far
Walking back to who you really are
