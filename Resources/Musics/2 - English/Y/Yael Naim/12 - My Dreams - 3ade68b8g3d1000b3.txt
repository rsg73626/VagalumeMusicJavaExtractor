MY DREAMS

You'll never say it's true
 You want it all for you
 Inside you know you do
 And I've been locked inside
 But help me understand
 You say you want my hand
 You wanted to be friends
 But now I understand
 
You only wanted my dreams
 But now I understand
 You only wanted my dreams
 For yourself? for yourself
 
You told me how to pray
 You said that I won't play
 You wanted me to stay
 And I'm still blind to see
 How you are playing with my fears
 But you create my tears
 But only I have to use
 It's now I understand
 
You only wanted my dreams
 But now I understand
 You only wanted my dreams
 
If somehow, I should dive
 Will you have a wonder why?
 I am real but you can't feel
 All that you araise and kill
 I will fly away from here
 All you took will disappear
 Was it my dream?
 
You said you want my land
 And I cannot pretend
 It's time for me to stay
 You're hard as it can't be
 I'm ready now to see
 I'm going to be free
 'Cause now I understand
 
You only wanted my dreams
 But now I understand
 You only wanted my dreams
 
You said you want my hand
 But I cannot pretend
 It's time for me to stay
 You're hard as it can't be
 I'm ready now to see
 I'm going to be free
