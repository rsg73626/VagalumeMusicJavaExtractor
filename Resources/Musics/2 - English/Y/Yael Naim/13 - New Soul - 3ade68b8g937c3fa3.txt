NEW SOUL

I'm a new soul I came to this strange world hoping 
I could learn a bit about how to give and take. 
But since I came here felt the joy and the fear
finding myself making every possible mistake

la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... 


I'm a young soul in this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout what is true and fake.
But why all this hate?
Try to communicate,
finding trust and love it's not so always easy to make

la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... 

This is a happy end cause' 
you don't understand
everything you have done why's 
everything so wrong 

this is a happy end 
come and give me your hand I'll
take your far away. 

[Refrain]: 
I'm a new soul 
I came to this strange world 
hoping I
could learn 
a bit about how to give and take 
but since
I came here felt the joy and the fear 
finding myself
making every possible mistake 

la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... 


la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la....
