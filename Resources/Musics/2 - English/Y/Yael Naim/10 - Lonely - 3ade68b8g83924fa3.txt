LONELY

You are not alone
I am here with you
Even when you're scared
I'll never leave you
Standing in a storm

Making it insane
Once again, I would try
To enchain you
But you open your eyes to the sky
and whisper

[Refrain:]
That you are so lonenly
You are so alone
You're so alone
You're so lonely, so lonely

So I'm colouring my face
While I am here with you
Imagining the landscape of your sorrow
Is it yellow or blue?

Colouring the sky, and the trees
and the clouds, and the moonlight
I'd coloured your heart
If you didn't I did

(Refrain)

And I wish you could just find home.
