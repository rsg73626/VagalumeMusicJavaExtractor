I TRY HARD

I try hard to spread my wings
You better look real high above all things
You gotta stay together, make things better

I try hard to learn new things
You better work real hard, on your fears

Instead of fighting together, work together

Try to see the reasons why
You sacrifice and lie
The reason we continue to deny

I only hear you say
The answer is to pray
But what if god himself is lost today

But all I can see is our longing to belong in
We're all alone afraid of the other side
The other side

Now that I have spread my wings
Now I don't want to fly away from here
I want to stay forever, make things better

Try hard to learn new things
You better work real hard on your beliefs

Instead of fighting together, work together

Try
The reason why you take
The reason why you fake
The reason you ignore all your mistakes

You say what's right or wrong
And feeling you belong
You separate yourself and think you're strong

But all I can see is our longing to belong in
We're all alone afraid of the other side
The other side

Try hard to spread my wings
You better work real hard on your fears
Instead of fighting together now, work together
Work together now
