LACHLOM

I wanted wings
To the horizon meanwhile
I wanted to approach
The other side of the rainbow

Let him dream
Human being
He needs to dream
Let him breathe
Human being
Asking to breathe

I have sadness
And suddenly I want
To sail on the water
I have magic
And suddenly I want
To fly to the sky
I have time
To look and dream
Upon the day
The other day
And the day after tomorrow

I wanted to touch
Our bliss
I wanted to know
Where we came from

Let her laugh
Human being
She needs to laugh
Let her see
Your heart
It wants to live
