WALK WALK

I'm gonna take my road, make my road
I'm gonna walk on by all night long
I'm looking for a home, for a home
I'm gonna march it down, on and on

Walk walk high, seasons go by
Walk walk by, suddenly I
Walk walk high, secret and lie
Walk walk 'til, the day that I die

I'm gonna change my tone, change my tone
I'm gonna sing it out on my own
I'm gonna tee you bone, tee you bone*
I'm gonna jump right into the unknown

Walk walk high, seasons go by
Walk walk by, suddenly I
Walk walk high, treason and lie
Walk walk 'til, the day that I die

Where's my place, where's my place
gotta go and find somewhere else
Where's the grace, where's the grace
Did I let it slip away

Where's my place, where's my place
gotta go and find somewhere else
Where's the grace, where's the grace
Did I let it slip away

(Walk, walk) Gonna take it away
(Walk, walk) Gonna take it away
(Walk, walk) Gonna take it away
Walk walk

Walk walk high, seasons go by
Walk walk by, suddenly I
Walk walk high, treason and lie
Walk walk 'til, the day that I die

Gonna take my road
Gonna make my road
I'm gonna walk on by
Al night long, all day long

Walk walk 'til the day that I die
