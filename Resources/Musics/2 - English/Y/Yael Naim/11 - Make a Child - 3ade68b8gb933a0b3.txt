MAKE A CHILD

You can make a child
but you're gonna have to dive through
I feel so alive gonna jump into the big blue
You can make child but you're gonna have to undo
Everything you are, everything you thought that you knew

You can, you can even cry
Worry 'bout the same old lies
No matter what the will advice
See I'm gonna make it anywhere so

You can make a child, just a little bit of (?)
I didn't realize what I was about to do
You can make a child, think of what you wanna tell (?)
It's the biggest love and it's really gonna heat you

You can, you can dry your eyes
Stop (?) on the old times
You can say it sounds so wild
But I'm gonna wake up everyday saying

I made a child, made a (...)
You can make a child, it's the only thing you can't fake
So afraid but know I think of (?)
You can make a child, a little thing that will be like you
Simply as you are you will figure out how to

How to overcome the fears
you've kept inside for many years
I will try to build a (?)
But I'm gonna let go of my (?) saying

I made a child, make a child, make a child
Drying my eyes, make a child, make a child, make a child
Drying my eyes now I'm gonna take it anywhere
It's all I want, it's all I am
I was going to start, falling apart, playing a part
Drying my eyes see I'm gonna do the best I can
I'll reach everything I wanna be
So much more than a thought
More than forever
Open my heart

You can make I child

OOh

You can make a child but you're gonna have to undo
Everything you are
everything you thought that you knew
You can make a child
but you're gonna have to dive through
I can make a child, gonna jump into the big blue
