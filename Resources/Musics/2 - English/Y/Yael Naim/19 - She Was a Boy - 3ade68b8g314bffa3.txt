SHE WAS A BOY

She was a boy, it wasn't easy for her
I was a child to see it
She came alone to build her story
I was so young and loved her

Go on you'll see
All that you want to be
While everybody's saying
Hold on, you'll see
You'll never be free
But we just kept on growing

She was a boy with some feelings for me
I was too wild and missed it
I came alone to hear her story
While no one else was worried

Go on she said
Or else you will grow sad
While everybody doubted
Hold on, they say
One day you'll have to pay
But I was so afraid to go

Hold on you're scared
You only need to dare
While everybody's laughing

Go on, you'll see
One day you'll be free
And you will understand why

She was a boy, she was a boy, she was a boy
Hiding in herself but
She was a boy, she was a boy
She knew that everyone was saying it

How much you want to see
How much you want to be
How much you want to live, see her growing
How much you want to see
How much you want to be
How much you want to live feel like falling
How much you want to see
How much you want to be
Wishing everyday you could see her face again
How much you want to give
How much you want to live
She was a boy

She was a boy
But she was there for me
I was a child and
She was a boy
