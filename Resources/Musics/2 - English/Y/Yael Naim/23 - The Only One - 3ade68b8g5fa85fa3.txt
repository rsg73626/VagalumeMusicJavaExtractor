THE ONLY ONE

I will be the one, you’ll see
I’m the only one
Yeah, I am the only one
We belong together

I will be the one to see
You’re the only one
Yeah, you’re the only one
Now until forever

You will see that we’re meant to be
Our love will grow peacefully
You should stay with me one more day
So how could we still walk away?

If you are the only one
You are the only one
I’m sure I feel the same

The one to blame
You’re the only one
Yeah, you’re the only one
Who can make me so light

I exclaim: where’s the flame?
You’re the only one
Yeah, you’re the only one
Who can hurt me so bad

We will be happy as can be
Our love you grow endlessly
Will you say you are here to stay
So how can you still walk away?

If you are the only one
I am the only one 
Who can make you see that
Yourself

You are a star, let me take you far
I can really feel who you are
We will shine everyday that’s rare
So how can you still do not care?

You’re the only one
Yeah, you’re the only one
But is so unfair

I’m the only one
Yeah, I’m the only one
To see...

It’s insane, no I remain
I’m the only one
You are the only one 
Who makes me so sad

Can you see how fast can be
Yeah, I’m the number one to see
You are the only one I can play this game
I’m the only one
I’m so glad you came…
