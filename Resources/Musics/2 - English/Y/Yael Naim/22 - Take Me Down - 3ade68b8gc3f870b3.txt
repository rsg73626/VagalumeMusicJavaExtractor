TAKE ME DOWN

Take me down to the ground
But I'm never gonna hate you
Fly me up into the sun
But I'm never gonna worship you
Bring back into the dawn
But I'm never gonna need you
Bring me back into your arms
But I'm never gonna change for you

I'm gonna take it, take it slow
I'm gonna think about it all night long
I'm gonna walk, walk around the world
I'm gonna take my time until you

Take my mind into the cloud
But you'll never gonna find me
Take me out into the crowd
But you'll never gonna guide me
Take everything I've got
But you'll never gonna rave me
Try to make me what I'm not
But you never gonna know me

I'm gonna let it, let it grow
I'm gonna learn about it on my own
I'm gonna talk and? around the world
Till I ready to leave with love

Bring me back

Bring me back to the place
Where it makes me belong to you
Bring back into the dawn
I'm never gonna hate you, hate you

Rectify until the end
But I couldn't just forgive you
I had to find a way to?
Cause I wanted not to fear you
Now we're back into the start
We forgot about who hated who
Together things we've done
? I need to prove it to you

But when I find myself alone
I'm gonna cry about it all night long
I got this quiet? around the world
I'm gonna lay down lay down

Take me down, take me down
Gonna bring me down

Take me down to the ground
But I'm never gonna hate you
Hate you
Hate you, hate you

Take me down to the ground
But I'm never gonna hate you
