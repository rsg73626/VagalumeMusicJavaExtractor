SHELCHA

Too many screams in my throat
Too many faces
Too many plans
That I wanted to change
So many words
If I can only tell you
There's no other love
but the one I live with you

Still don't know how
we let all this happened
will this war last forever and ever?
They've burned my hands
Cut my hair and steal my soul
But do you really want to know?

Rest in peace with my sorrows
Are we alone or together
Or are you my greatest war?
