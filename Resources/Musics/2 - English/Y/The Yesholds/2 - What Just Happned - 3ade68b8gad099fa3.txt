WHAT JUST HAPPNED

I know, that's strange...But I can't even bear it.
My mind, is no confuce...And I can't talk with her
Now I, will try so hard, to see who are you.
My mouths is so cold... and my lips so close of yours

That's the nodern way, of humanity.
That's the new way, to make your mind.

Love, none is obscene.
And kisses are all somekind of trash
I see, if this kiss came of your heart
Or just make my mind.

Hello?It's Anybodyin here?
Who can understand, new way...
The modern way...

I wanna die!I don't wanna live any more
But if you, change the rules,
I think.Ihave a chance, to be, happy again.

Hey!I have see this scene before.
And what i remember was not, a good
Or a just real sensation.

I can't understand, what just happned in here now.
We can't not go back, to the older way
And now, I will just believe in heaven
