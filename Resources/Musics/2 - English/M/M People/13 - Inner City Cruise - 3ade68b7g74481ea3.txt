INNER CITY CRUISE

Ah-ha, do the inner city hustle.
A bad break, all of that noise and bustle.
I need a space, a highway right to where you're going.
The main line, just down the track where life is growing.

[chorus]
Hold tight, we'll blow away the blues.
Come on board, what you got to lose.
No time to waste, forget about the rules.
Come on with me on an inner city cruise.

There's a place where mind and nature join together.
Where beaty wakes and shelters us from stormy weather.
You'll find no war, a paradise, a state of mind.
Come cruise with us happiness is what you'll find.

[chorus]

Ah-ha.

Whaaaaho!

Hold tight, we'll blow away the blues.
Come on board, what you got to lose. (what you got to lose)
No time to waste, forget about the rules.
Come on with me on an inner city cruise.

Ah-ha.

Hold tight, we'll blow away the blues. (we'll blow away the blues)
Come on board, what you got to lose. (what you got to lose)
No time to waste, forget about the rules.
Come on with me on an inner city cruise.

Ah-ha.
