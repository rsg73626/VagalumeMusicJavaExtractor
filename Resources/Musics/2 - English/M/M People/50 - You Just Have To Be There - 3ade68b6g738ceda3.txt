YOU JUST HAVE TO BE THERE

Well a strange thing happened to me yesterday.
I looked at your stars and ooh I saw the Milky Way.
And if you could feel just half as much as me.
Then I wouldn't be just another leaf on your tree.
Well I never thought I'd feel this way.
You are my life, my night and day.
It's such a thrill deep down inside.
Just too much love for me to hide.

Chorus:

You just have to be there. In my life.
You just have to be there. It feels so right.

I wake up alone and everything is cold and grey.
You walk in a room and brighten up a cloudy day.
Friends will arrive then they disappear.
But if you want me baby, honey I'll be here.
'Cause those little things said in the dark.
One touch from you ignites the spark.
Sweetest boy, you can do no wrong.
The power of love, it burns so strong.

Repeat chorus.
