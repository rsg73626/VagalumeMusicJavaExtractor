DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER

Someone to count on, in a world ever changin'.
Here I am stop where you're standin'.
What you need is a lover, someone to take over.
Oh baby don't look any further.
Strange when you think of our chances.
That we'be both been in a state of mind.
Too cool to be careless. Looking for the right thing.
Oh baby don't look any further.
Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise.
Rockin' all night long.
Daylight I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes.

Chorus:

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o. Don't look any further.
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o. Don't look any further.

[Someone to count on (someone to count on) in a world ever changin'.
Here I am, stop where you standin'.
What you need is a lover (you need a lover)
to love you all over (love you all over).
Oh baby don't look any further (further).
Tonight (tonight) we're gonna taste a little paradise.
Rock you night long. Rock me all night long.
Daylight (daylight) I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes.
We'll go on and on and on.
[chorus] [x2]
