WALK AWAY

A little girl cries next door,
I just wanna hold her hand.
Sometimes it gets so tough
with my head buried in the sand.
And everyday more people die,
walk away, avert their eyes.
As the death clock ticks, the trigger clicks
beaten with a crucifix.
Bullet proof lies, family ties.
Which one's right, no one's wise.
In a world that lies.

[chorus]
Walk away. Tomorrow's another day.
Walk away. Why not let it fade away?
Walk away. Tomorrow's another day.
Walk away. The problem will go away.

A little boy cries next door,
I just wanna hold his hand.
Sometimes it gets so hard
with my head buried in the sand.
The holy squad is filled with hate.
Terror strikes Joe Public's fate.
TV blood, a crime rate vote.
Politics and a suicide note.
Who is bad and what is good?
Earth and water, flesh and blood.
We'd help every bro'.

[chorus]

(Walk away, walk away.) [x2]

Don't look back before you (walk away, walk away.) [x2]

[chorus]

Walk away. (Walk away, walk away)
(Walk away, walk away)
Walk away. (Walk away, walk away)
(Walk away, walk away)

Don't look up. (Walk away, walk away)
Don't look down, just keep on walking away. (Walk away, walk away)
(Walk away, walk away)
You people, keep on walking away. (Walk away, walk away)
Just keep on walking away. [x2]
