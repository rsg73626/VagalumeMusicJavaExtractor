MOVING ON UP

You've done me wrong,
Your time is up
You took a sip (just a sip) from the Devil's cup
You broke my heart, there's no way back
Move right outta here baby
Go and pack your bags
Just who do you think you are?
Stop acting like some kind of star
Just who do you think you are?
Take it like a man baby
If that's what you are
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Movin' on up
Nothing can stop me
Moving on up
You're moving on out
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me,
Yeah

They brag a man has walked in space,
But you can't even find my place
Mm...there ain't nothing (not a thing)
You can do
'Cause I've had enough of me
Baby being part of you

Just who do you think you are?
This time you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are?
Take it like a man baby
If that's what you are

Repeat chorus
