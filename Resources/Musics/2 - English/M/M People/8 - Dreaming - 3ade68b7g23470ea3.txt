DREAMING

I close my eyes and see
A vision of what used to be
Such beauty

Undress me to the bone
Scatter seeds among the stones
Canâ€™t you see

Imagine brown eyes, love
And wonder
Thatâ€™s what keeps me from 
Goinâ€™ under
Imagine passing through
Yous shadow
A fly-by-angel at your window

Am I dreaming again
Dreaming of when
I thought you were heaven sent
But I wonder
Dreaming again
Dreaming of when
I thought love was innocent
But I wonder

Walkinâ€™ through empty streets
Gazinâ€™ at your history
So blue yeah
Deep in the heart of me
I just canâ€™t shake the memories
Itâ€™s you yeah

Imagine walkinâ€™ on the water
The past keeps cominâ€™ back to
