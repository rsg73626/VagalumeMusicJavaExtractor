LAST NIGHT 10,000

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

Donâ€™t let the rain wash my heart
Iâ€™ve love in here but where do I start.
No more life to my shoes.
Donâ€™t look my way you know Iâ€™m bad news.
Feel the tears on my cheek.
Abuse me now `cause Iâ€™ve got to eat.
Where was last night I forget.
This ainâ€™t no big issue just life and death.

Last night 10,000
out in the rain
bellowing silence
maybe itâ€™s now or never again.

Eyes are down looking in
Iâ€™m sorry but Iâ€™m not on your screen.
I hold a cup in my hand
to help me reach my own promised land.
Crown of thorns on my head
wrapped up in my own cardboard bed.
I got youth by my side
a victim of your crime nothing to hide.

Last night 10,000
out in the rain
bellowing silence
maybe itâ€™s now or never again.

Iâ€™ll do anything to forget
after all what is there left.
But in the black of night 
frosty stars and vice.
Iâ€™m too old to learn
too young to burn
And as you walk by with ghosts in your eyes
