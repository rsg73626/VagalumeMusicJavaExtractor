SMILE

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

A glance back at the time I spent with you
I know you feel the same way too.

A kiss to wipe away the tears
canâ€™t keep on pushinâ€™ back the years
we gave up this thing long ago
just like the stream forever flows.

This ainâ€™t devotion and itâ€™s not defeat
Iâ€™m trapped in a kitchen canâ€™t stand the heat
like tears falling from a wounded sky
letâ€™s leave it here itâ€™s time to say goodbye.

Youâ€™re not the man who used to make me smile
oh no.
I guess I should be movinâ€™ on.

Youâ€™re not the man who used to make me smile
oh no.
I guess I should be feelinâ€™ strong.

Would it make you happy if I said I cared for you
oh no.
Spread my warmth around you in the cold night air.

Walk with me up to the edge
looking over at our life ahead.
I may seem a fool to you
In everything I say or do
but I know this is our fate
I think weâ€™re past the sell-by date
the encores through, the show at an end
consign me to history but stay my friend.

Stay my friend

Youâ€™re not the man who used to make me smile
oh no.
I guess I should be movinâ€™ on.

Youâ€™re not the man who used to make me smile
oh no.
