SOMEDAY

The world is cold and times are bad.
Everytime I think about it, it makes me sad.
War and drugs are everywhere
and it's getting so hard to breathe the air.
But it doesn't have to be like this,
all the rancour and bitterness.
If we can just open our eyes
we can make this world a paradise.

Someday.
We'll live as one family in perfect harmony.
Someday.
If we all pull together we will all be free.

Someday (someday!) [x3]

Free from the pressure and the prejudice
(FREE FROM OPRESSION AND PREJUDUICE ) 
we can change it all with tenderness.
There'll be no void between black and white.
We'll be able to walk the streets at night.
I won't be fooled while someone dies of starvation,
the whole world will be my nation.
We will walk hand in hand.
I'll go to South Africa and be called woman.

Someday.
We'll live as one family in sweet harmony.
Someday.
If we all pull together we will all be free.

Mmmm, someday.
We'll all be free - mmmm, you and me.
Someday (someday!) [x3]
We will all be free, (someday) free, FREE!

Someday!
I wanna be
Someday!
Free!
Someday!
Free!
Someday! [x2]
Someday! (someday) [x2]
Someday!

Someday we'll all be free... [x2]
Hmm,
someday [x6]
we'll all be free... 
Hey I wanna be free, free, FREE!

There'll be no ghettos, no addiction.
All today's troubles will seem like fiction.
We will walk hand-in-hand.
I'll go to South Africa and be called woman.

Someday (someday!) [x2]
Hey, I wanna be
Someday (someday!)
Free!
Someday...
