LIFE

People in power waste their time
to young and creative, to lives of crime.
Logic's a tool so very unusual,
we all had enough of the crack abuse.
It's time to change our nation's rules.
Freedom's a right, ignored by fools.
We choose our selves between right and wrong.
We've got to be free, we've got to be strong.

[chorus]
Life - could be so beautiful
if truth were known.
And life should be so wonderful
but it sears our soul.
Life - could be so beautiful.
Make your life your own.

They lived their life in a love-shy city.
They got no cure, they got no pity.
They got no taste, they got no vision
and gilted by their own malicement.
Tris jumped down for some fleet street clown
for straight lies as they come down.
All we need is a sense of truth
so why lay the blame on this nation's youth?

[chorus]

Make your life your own.

Freedom's a right not privilege.

Life never ending all transcending.
Play the game by the rules of ending.
Never surrender. Lecture be spender.
Train for hours. Hacienda.

[chorus] [x3]
