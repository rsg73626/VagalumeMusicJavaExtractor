LANDSCAPE OF LOVE

[chorus]
Come on and walk with me through this landscape of love.

[chorus] [x2]

Free, free like the bird that is waiting to fly.
Free, free like the mountains, almost to the sky.

Free.

[chorus] [x2]

(Come on and) [x4]

Hold my hand, walk across this land. (Come on and) [x4]

(Come on and)

[chorus] [x2]
