JUST FOR YOU

I will climb the highest mountain
just for you.
Bring gold and silver to your door
just for you.
I will raise my glass up to the sky
just for you.
I will be your strength and be your pride
be with you.

I'll make sweet soul music all night long
just for you.
Make you feel that you belong
just for you.
We'll take a ride in the tunnel of love
just us two.
I will scream aloud at the altar of God
I love you.

[Chorus]
Just for you I'll wash you down,
cleanse your soul and be around,
hold your hand and lead the way,
be with you all through your day.
Just for you I'll sacrifice
everything in my life,
I will give all this to you,
dedicate my self to you...
Just for you, just for you, just for you, yeah (just for you)
Just for you, just for you, just for you (just for you)
Just for you, just for you, just for you, yeah (just for you)
Just for you, just for you, just for you (just for you)
I'll be a shooting star in the sky at night
just for you.
I'll be your mother of pearl, diamond girl
just for you.
I'll lock the door, throw away the key
just for you.
I am the air that you breathe
I am you.

[Chorus]

I'll terrorise, publicise, capitalise, mesmerise,
idolise, wave goodbyes to all the things you despise.

Just for you. Just for you.

[Chorus]

I'll climb the highest mountain,
until I reach the top.
I'll climb the highest mountain,
and I will not stop.
I'll climb the highest mountain (highest mountain),
and I'll never stop (never stop).
I'll climb the highest mountain (highest mountain),
until I reach the top (reach the top).

I'm gonna climb that mountain (highest mountain),
I'm gonna reach the top (never stop).
I'm gonna climb that mountain (highest mountain),
I'm gonna reach the top (reach the top).

And I will not stop (highest mountain, never stop)
And I will not stop (highest mountain, reach the top)

Higher and higher and higher (highest mountain, never stop)
Higher and higher and higher (highest mountain, reach the top)

Just for you (highest mountain, never stop)
Just for you (highest mountain, reach the top)
Just for you.....
