BELIEVE IT

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

Spent Sunday morning in the air
liquid lizards, laissez faire.
The Holy Cow on a gravy train
a little stain, so much pain.
Hey little angels drive on through
the Chicken killer smiles at you.
All steamed up on a video
it sure looks cool just like Hell below.

Can you believe it.
You gotta read it
`cause itâ€™s all about you.
Can U believe
iâ€™m down on my knees.
Tell me what can I do.

I looked at love on Channel 3
I just don't know who to believe
Johnny slapped her in the face
turn the cheek, turn the page.
Boombox plays who get the joke
I canâ€™t help wondering whatâ€™s the dope.
goldfish bowl inside my head
truth and lies hanging by a thread.
