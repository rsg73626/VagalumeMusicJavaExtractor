LITTLE PACKET

Chorus 1:

Take the fast lane baby. You travel so light.
The fast lane mother. Your bark is your bite.
Fast lane baby. It's all such a gas.
Fast lane honey. You wave as you pass.

I got a packet, I keep it for my mind.
I'm so impressive so handsome and so kind.
There's people wanting to talk to me all day.
There's people hanging on every word I say.
Get busy one time.

Chorus 2:

I dial 9 I need an outside line.
To another world that leaves me feeling fine.
I dial 9 I need an outside line.
To another world that leaves me feeling fine.

Repeat chorus 1

I talk a lot, everything I say is wise.
I chop 'n' change the picture turns to black 'n' white.
I try so hard to promise you the world and more.
It's my career c'mon it's time I had some more.
