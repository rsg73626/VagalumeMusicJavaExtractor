LONELY

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

As I look out on the World and sigh
watching as you walk on by.
Oh sweet melody, let me hear that voice
so I can feel my heart fill with joy.
Oh yeah such joy
no other feeling has any meaning
nothing compares to this.
You are the reason I still believe in
an everlasting bliss.
I have a hero, how can I feel low
I owe it all to you
Joy, sweet joy
and so I say to you

How can you be so lonely
With me in your life.
How can you be so lonely
câ€™mon take my advice.
How can you be so lonely
with me in your life.
How can you be so lonely
with me by your side.

In a life striving to survive
you are my guiding light.
Like fruit on a tree and the air we breathe
you are my freedom, my strength inside.
Oh yeah such joy
no other feeling has any meaning
nothing compares to this.
You are the reason I still believe in
an everlasting kiss.
I have a hero, how can I feel low
I owe it all to you
Joy, sweet joy
and so I say to you

How can you be so lonely
with me in your life.
How can you be so lonely
câ€™mon take my advice.
How can you be so lonely
with me in your life.
How can you be so lonely
with me by your side.

How can you be lonely
when I need you baby.
How can you be lonely
when I need you baby.
How can you be lonely
never lonely baby.
How can you be lonely.
