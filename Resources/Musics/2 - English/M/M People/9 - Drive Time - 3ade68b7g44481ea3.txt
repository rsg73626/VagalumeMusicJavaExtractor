DRIVE TIME

1 2 3 4.

We'll ride coast to coast in my holy ghost.
Chrome wheel, fuel injected, high on hope.
Soul engines cruisin' on down the road.
Wind down your glass and let your mind explode.
Hit my ignition rocket 88.
Freewheel all night, let's seal our fate.

[chorus 1]
'Cos it's drive time baby, drive me wild.
Mmm, it's drive time baby, be my wild child.

I ain't no backseat driver, my hands on the wheel.
I got no standard features, got speed appeal.
Red light, green light, hit the overdrive.
Foot down baby, make me feel alive.
White line high in my love express.
C'mon now drive me back to happiness.

[chorus1] [x2]

[chorus 2] [x2]
You drive me wild. You really drive me wild.
You drive me wild.
You drive me, drive me wild.

White line high. (Mmmm)
White line high. (Oh yeah)
White line high.
So get in the car and we'll drive to the stars
if it's a love in my arms, baby.

[chorus 2]

You drive me wild. You really drive me wild.
You drive me wild.

[chorus 1] [x2]

[chorus 2]

You drive me wild. You really drive me wild.
You drive me wild.

Drive on baby.
(You drive me wild. You really drive me wild)
(You drive me wild)
(You drive me, drive me wild)
Drive me. (You drive me wild)
Wilde. (You really drive me wild)
Drive me. (You drive me wild)
Yeah. (You got me driving wild)
