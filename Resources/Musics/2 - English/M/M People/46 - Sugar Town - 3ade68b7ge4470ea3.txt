SUGAR TOWN

Raining, raining, raining. Rain in sugar town. [x2]

A new day dawns across the tracks,
tile by tile the chimney stacks.
A city steeped in history
but so much pain and misery.
Rain on me, rain hard and long.
Faith of our fathers makes 'em strong.
Rain on me, rain hard and long.
Rain down on the place that I belong.

[chorus]
'Cos it's just another night in sugar town.
And the rain is falling down in sugar town.

"I'm alright", I say to Jack,
"just get this monkey off my back."
Sugar town in urban light -
people got no cash and it don't seem right.
Blue light fever, downtown crash.
One man's treasure, one man's trash.
Rain on me, rain hard and long.
Rain down on the place that I belong.

[chorus] [x2]

I don't ask a lot, all I want is one god shot. [x2]
I work and work, prepare myself.
Wait all my life and lose my health.
From a file to the brain cold steel more rain.
Rain, rain, rain.

Raining, raining, raining. Rain in sugar town. [x2]

Muscle man with bully boy plan.
Catch us baby if you can.
Streets of gold, oh streets of gold -
asleep on concrete, feels so cold.
Rain on me, rain hard and long - rain. [x2]

Raining, raining, raining. Rain in sugar town. [x4]

Rain on me, rain hard and long - rain. [x4]

Raining, raining, raining, raining. [x2]
