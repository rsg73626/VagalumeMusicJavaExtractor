RENAISSANCE

I'm coming home, I'm coming home to your house. [x4]

Boy there's so many things to give.
I've been aware of your charms for so long
and there's nothing that you can do
to stop me from coming around, round
to your house. [x4]

but there's still no point in being alone.
So unlock your door I'm coming through
'cos this hearts got a message for you.
