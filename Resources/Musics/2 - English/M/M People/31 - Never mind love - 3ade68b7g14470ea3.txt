NEVER MIND LOVE

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

I played out this scene before too many times.
I walked across the crowded room and looked him in the eye.
He looked up to me and said would i lie to you
but he didn't know what I know, what I'm going to do.
So go to hell now, 'cause I don't care for you.
I don't need you, you're a stone in my shoe.
You think i'm stupid, well i've got news for you.
I ain't no cupid, and so I say to you

Never mind my never never love
Never mind my never never love
I say never mind my never never love
Never mind my never never love

How you gonna change the habit of a lifetime overnight.
You think you're so immortal, so eternal, out of sight.
The questions I am gonna ask aren't the ones you wanna hear.
Alone inside your narrow mind, now lets get one thing clear
unlike Sinatra you ain't under my skin.
What can I tell ya, don't know where to begin.
Can't find you heart now, but who's lookin' anyway.
