BOHEMIA

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small


The one-eyed tattoo artist
arrives at a sushi sunset.
Walks right on over to my spot
sayâ€™s listen girl one hot sec.
Mmm java jive man alive
gotta keep on climbing `til I get real high
poets in my head, Prada on my feet
this ainâ€™t your average tourist, know what I mean.

Global salsa.
Love and laughter.
Gonna have to
get on down to Bohemia.
Global salsa.
Love and laughter.
Gonna hafta
Take you down to Bohemia.

I walk into the Boneyard
an Angel looks up to me
says get up off your island
or you ainâ€™t in my movie.
Mmm charcoal black, blood on the tracks
I hitched a ride on a love train, I ainâ€™t cominâ€™ back
I walk through streets of fire, no shoes on my feet.
A walk on the wildside, know what I mean.

Global salsa.
Love and laughter.
Gonna have to
get on down to Bohemia.
Global salsa.
Love and laughter.
Morning after
