NATURAL THING

Our love, our love, our love. Is a natural thing. [x2]

Take a breath and wonder why such things exist at all.
A moment in time. A love so sublime.
Like a yellow field in June. An eclipse of the moon.
A river flowing through the land. A boy and girl are holding hands.

Our love, our love, our love. Is a natural thing. [x2]
Like water from a spring it's such a natural thing. [x2]
Our love, our love, our love. Is a natural thing.

Nothing can compare with this in our state of natural bliss.
A moment in time. A love so sublime.
A the sea that crashes to the shore. What we have is oh so pure.
A woman giving birth. Flowers growing from the earth.

Our love, our love, our love. Is a natural thing. [x2]
Like Picasso with a brush I get that natural rush.
Like water from a spring it's such a natural thing.
Our love, our love, our love. Is a natural thing.

If you're so natural, natural, natural, natural love. [x2]

Our love, our love, our love. Is a natural thing. [repeat]
