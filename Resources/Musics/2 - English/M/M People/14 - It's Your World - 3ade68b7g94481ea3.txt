IT'S YOUR WORLD

When you find, when you find that your world is upside down
and you feel that life is a circus and you're the clown.
Don't give up, don't be down, don't let your face carry a frown.
Life's too short to waste it away.
It's your time, it's your day.

[chorus]
Oooh, it's your world.
(it's your world, it's your world yeah)
Oooh, it's your world.
(it's your world, it's your world yeah, heh, heay)

When you wake, when you wake up this morning it's your day.
You can make, you can make it your own world, rest or play.
So much to see, so much to do.
Dream all your dreams and make them come true.
It's your time don't waste it away.
Live for tomorrow, live for today.

[chorus]
(yeah, yeah, yeah, it's your world)

Never stop dreaming, never stop scheming.
Keep on reaching, children need teaching.
Open your hearts, stand up, and be bold.
Don't make life make you feel old.

[chorus]

Oooh, it's your world.
Life's too short to waste it away.
(Oooh, it's your world)
Live each second of every day. (yeah heh)
Oooh, it's your world.
(it's your world, it's your world yeah)
Oooh, it's your world.
(Oooh, it's your world yeah, heh, heay)
Oooh, it's your world.
(Oooh, it's your world yeah)
Oooh, it's your world.
(Oooh, it's your world yeah, heh, heay)
