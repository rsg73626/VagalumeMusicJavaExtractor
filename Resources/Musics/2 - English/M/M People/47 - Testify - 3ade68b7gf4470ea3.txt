TESTIFY

A boy and girl
In a mixed up world
But ainâ€™t nothing wrong
With the life
That we can make
Shelter me
Help me breathe
Letâ€™s celebrate a lifetime
Made for us

Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Fallinâ€™ in love, Iâ€™ve got no regrets
Stay with me forever

Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Reach out for me, hold me
Tight and letâ€™s
Bring it down on me
So we can

Testify, you and I
Love has got me on a mighty high
Testify, you and I
Iâ€™m gonna testify â€˜cos youâ€™re
The reason why

Born to kiss
A little tenderness
You know it ainâ€™t no sin to be glad
That youâ€™re alive
My soulmate
I canâ€™t contemplate
A solo life so come on
Lets make a lifetime

Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Fallinâ€™ in love, Iâ€™ve got no regrets
Stay with me forever

Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Longer it lasts and the
Better it gets
Reach out for me, hold me
Tight and letâ€™s
Bring it down on me
So we can

Testify, you and I
Love has got me on a mighty high
Testify, you and I
Both please letâ€™s make
Some memories

I believe in your magic spell
I believe only time will tell
Every love has got itâ€™s own problems
Weâ€™ll solve â€˜em
So take my hand and make
A stand
