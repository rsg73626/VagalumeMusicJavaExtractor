ANGEL STREET

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

If you think the World owes you a ride
youâ€™ll never find the reason why.
Boy you know itâ€™s down to you.
Lookinâ€™ down youâ€™ll only see your own two feet.
Mama used to say to me
take a walk down Angel St.
So sweet thing have I got news for you
come and taste my soul food.
So what have you got to lose

Angel Street.
Stand on your own two feet
`cos baby canâ€™t you see
if were to stay alive
only the strong survive.


Donâ€™t you know if you canâ€™t respect yourself
youâ€™ll be left on the shelf
no oneâ€™s gonna carry you.
Walkinâ€™ tall dreaminâ€™ of love and pride
reachinâ€™ up to the sky
arms and eyes are open wide.
So come on letâ€™s climb the stairs out of this
make a wish and steal a kiss
