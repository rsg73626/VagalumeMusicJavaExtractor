FANTASY ISLAND

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

Gather round people I just dreamt of this song
about all the World gettinâ€™ along.
Human rights, no shallow graves
politicianâ€™s speak the truth, no oneâ€™s got Aids.
I look at a Muslim embracing a Jew
everyone's eating everyoneâ€™s food.
Free from diseases, ainâ€™t no Third World
love is the message, love is the word.

[Chorus] [x2]
This is my island (island),
my fantasy (my fantasy),
my fantasy (fantasy).

Thereâ€™s a welcome mat at the centre of the earth.
No sign of hate, a four-letter word.
The children are playing in air you can breathe
people got dreams, people achieve.
Everywhereâ€™s music, sunshine and laughter
we still feel the same the morning after
words in the air, love in the heart.
This is my dream, a brand new start

[Chorus] [x2]

(This is my fantasy) [x8]

Believe in me baby.

[Chorus 2] [x2]
Say what have we got
we got the power (we got the power).
Got sixty seconds, got every hour (every hour).
Say what have we got
we got the power (we got the power).
We are the spark to light the fire (light the fire).
Got one blood, got one skin
got one soul deep within.
Got a heart beating fast
got a dream got no past.

Say what have we got.

This is my, this is my, this is my fantasy. [x2]

[Chorus] [x2]
