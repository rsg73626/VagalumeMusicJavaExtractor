ITCHYCOO PARK

(Marriott/Lane)

(If you reach on high - do it. If you reach on high) [x2]
(If you reach)

Over bridge of sighs,
to rest my eyes in shades of green
under dreaming spires
to Itchycoo Park. That's where I've been.
(What did you do there?)
I got high...
(What did you feel there?)
Well, I cried...
(But why the tears then?)
Tell you why...

It's all too beautiful! [x4]

I'll tell you what I'll do.
(What will you do?)
I'd like to go there now with you,
you can miss out school.
(Won't that be cool?)
Why go to hear the words of fools?
(What did you do there?)
I got high...
(What did you touch there?)
I touched the sky...
(But why the tears then?)
I'll tell you why...

It's all too beautiful! [x4]

(Beaty) [x10]

(Beatiful) [x3]
(-ful yeah)

I feel inclined to blow my mind,
get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun.
They all come out to groove about
be nice and have fun in the sun.

(What did you do there?)
I got high...
(What did you touch there?)
I touched the sky...
(But why the tears then?)
Tell you why...

(It's all too beautiful!) [x4]

It's all so beautiful. (It's all too beautiful!) [x4]

(so beautiful) Beautiful. [x4]

Yeah heah. [x3]

(It's all too beautiful!)
It's so beautiful, yeah.
(It's all too beautiful!)
It's beautiful.
(It's all too beautiful!)
Beautiful, yeah.
(It's all too beautiful!)

Beaty all around me.
