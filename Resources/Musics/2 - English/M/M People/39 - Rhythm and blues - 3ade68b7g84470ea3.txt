RHYTHM AND BLUES

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

Hard to imagine the blood thatâ€™s runninâ€™ through my veins
nothinâ€™ but trouble, inside of me liberty in chains.
Born to a Nation, the children and their innocence
an idiot wind blows through this land
Dear Lord give me strength.

Breakinâ€™ out of the skin
need some rhythm and blues.
Coming deep from within
itâ€™s those rhythm and blues.

Down in the ghetto, marking time with self-belief
babylon voices, square-eyed dreams of dignity.
Feeling the pressure, searching for another place
lift up our voices, use our minds
we will be released.

Breakinâ€™ out of the skin
need some rhythm and blues.
Coming deep from within
itâ€™s those rhythm and blues.

The sun shine in our eyes
