OPEN YOUR HEART

If I only knew how you feel
I would give my heart to you.
And if you let me in on your deal
maybe I won't feel so blue.
Give me a signal... from the heart.
Some kind of sign boy... of who you really are.
Don't waste my time 'cos... we've come too far.
You must decide now... if I'm your star.

[chorus]
Open up your heart. (Oh baby, baby)
Open up your heart.
Make me feel a part. (Oh baby, baby)
Open up your heart.

Why don't you wear your heart on my sleeve
then you can take your place by me.
And as I've got more to give than you need,
come on and end this misery.
Give me a signal... from the heart.
Some kind of sign boy... of who you really are.
Don't waste my time 'cos... we've come too far.
It makes no sense now... when we're apart.

[chorus] [x2]

Give me a signal... from the heart.
Some kind of sign boy... of who you really are.
Don't waste my time 'cos... we've come too far.
You must decide now... if I'm your star.

[chorus] [x2]

Baby, baby, baby. [x2]
