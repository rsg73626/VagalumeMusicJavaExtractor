SEXUAL FREEDOM

Free free free my body, I want to love somebody. [x4]

Free, free me now. [x3]
Come on and free, free me now.

[chorus]
Sexual freedom, sexual freedom.
I need some sexual freedom.
Sexual freedom, sexual freedom, sexual freedom.
I need some sexual freedom.

Give it to me. [x2]
(Come on) [x4]

It takes more than an hour to turn a seed into flower.
But it only takes a night to turn darkness into light.

(Come on)

Free free free my body, I want to love somebody. [x2]

[chorus]

Give it to me.
Sexual freedom, sexual freedom.
I need some sexual freedom.
Sexual freedom, sexual freedom, sexual freedom.
