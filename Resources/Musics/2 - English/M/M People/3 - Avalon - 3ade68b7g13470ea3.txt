AVALON

Written by - Brian Ferry


Now the partyâ€™s over Iâ€™m so tired.
Then I see you coming
out of nowhere.
Much communication in a motion
without conversation or a notion.

Avalon

When the samba takes you 
out of nowhere.
And the backgroundâ€™s fading
out of focus.
Yes the pictureâ€™s changing
every moment
and your destination
you donâ€™t know it.

Avalon
Avalon
Avalon

When you're bossa nova
thereâ€™s no holding.
Would you have me dancing
out of nowhere.

Avalon
