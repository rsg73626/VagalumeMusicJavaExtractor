If you arent here I would die
Because you make me feel alive
Everytime I see your face I feel like I fly
Like a lil man
The thing that make me happiest

Its to touch your skin
Is to take your hand
Is to hear your voice
Because you are exeptional

Nobody can talk to you like I do
Nobody can kiss your mouth like I do
Nobody can make tha love to you like I do
Because my love is true
And is only for you
