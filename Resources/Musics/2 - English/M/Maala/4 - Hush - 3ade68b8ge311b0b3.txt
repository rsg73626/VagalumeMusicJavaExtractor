HUSH

At the time to be calling on the phone
I don't minds it, don't minds it
Just the mess, switched me down she's alone
I don't find it cause
She wants me to know
That this ain't serious
She wants me to know
That this could end any minute
Hush now, you told me hush
(ain't that closer, oh no)
(don't be alone to say)
Hush now, you told me hush
(can't left you with no reason)
(save any moment, I'll be there)
It's in her eyes
Know exactly what she wants
I don't minds it, don't minds it
She's the one has showed me
Everything I learnt
I don't find it cause
She wants me to know
That this ain't serious
She wants me to know
That this could end any minute
Forget any closer, this gets dangerous
Say, just cause I hold you near
Don't get the wrong idea
Hush now, you told me hush
(ain't that close, oh no)
(don't be alone to say)
Hush now, you told me hush
(can't left with no reason)
(save any moment, I'll be there)
I know it's all I'm seeing
I'm drowning and I can't let go
I can't just lose the feeling
Been telling me so
Hush now, you told me hush
(ain't that close, oh no)
(don't be alone to say)
Hush now, you told me hush
(can't left with no reason)
(save any moment, I'll be there)
Hush now, you told me hush
(ain't that close, oh no)
(don't be alone to say)
Hush now, you told me hush
(can't left you with no reason)
(save any moment, I'll be there)
