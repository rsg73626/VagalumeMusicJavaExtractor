MAGIC

You saw
Magic within your eyes faded
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
All that
Time we spend on the outside
Wasted lying by your side
Burnt out eyes on the lost life

You saw
Magic within your eyes faded
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
You saw
Magic within your eyes faded
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
Closure
The fair in front
The time undone now
All that I know
Time faded
Fill my lungs
I know I can front
Follow you down

Oh, I don't wanna go down
Oh, I don't wanna leave you here
Oh, I don't wanna fix you
Oh, I don't wanna leave your fear

Oh, I don't wanna go down
Oh, I don't wanna leave you here
Oh, I don't wanna fix you
Oh, I don't wanna leave your fear

You saw
Magic within your eyes faded
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
You saw
Magic within your eyes faded
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
Play it like it's your last game
