LET ME KNOW

Tell me what I wanna hear
Body close, you set in stone
Tell me what I wanna hear
Cause I haven't seen for on my own
Cause in the end
I could never win the fight
It's in your hand
Watch it fade to black and white
Can't be pretend
I was laying by your side
In the end
Watch it fade to black and white
Something that I've never showed
Let me know
Let me know
Tell me where I need to go
Let me know
Let me know
Give up your god, let's make it real
Your beating heart on broken bones
We're going on to many years
As we shut that feeling gone
Cause in the end
I could never win the fight
It's in your hand
Watch it fade to black and white
Can't be pretend
I was laying by your side
In the end
Watch it fade to black and white
Something that I've never showed
Let me know
Let me know
Tell me where I need to go
Let me know
Let me know
