IN THE AIR

I remember
How it started
held my hand and I held yours
It was colder and the night hurt
We were younger than we thought

Why'd you only give yourself a chance
Why'd you keep going with nothing left?
All fired up in the heat of it

Keep it slow
What I need is to find what makes the thrill of it
Hold the hope there's something left
I don't know
If what I need in the farm is over there
it's in the air, it's in the air
I remember

In the laughter, in the silence
And the words I could have spoke
In the moment, at a standstill
And the thoughts we held in hope
Why'd you only give ourself a chance?
Why'd you keep going with nothing left?
All fired up in the heat of it
Where they're not that far ahead
Why'd you only give ourself a chance?
Why'd you keep going with nothing left?
All fired up in the heat of it
Where they're not that far ahead

Keep it slow
What I need is to find what makes the thrill of it
Hold the hope there's something left
I don't know
If what I need in the farm is over there
it's in the air, it's in the air
I remember

We were guarded, broken hearted, bound by hope
We had started, could've lost it on our own

Keep it slow
What I need is to find what makes the thrill of it
Hold the hope there's something left
I don't know
If what I need in the farm is over there
it's in the air, it's in the air, it's in the air
Keep it slow
What I need is to find what makes the thrill of it
Hold the hope there's something left
I don't know
If what I need in the farm is over there
it's in the air, it's in the air
