TOUCH

She dropped her sight
Unguarded, won't fight it
World can't see she's gonna leave him blinded
Lights off, don't stop
In silence, one sided
I felt your touch, won't find compromise
Why am I holding on to the nothing left
What am I going to say at the end
Holding left me at the very edge
Find another desire

How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
Boys and blurred shark
Unravelled, ignited
Held down, eyes shut
Felt our time subside

Why am I holding on to the nothing left
What am I going to say at the end
Holding left me at the very edge
Find another desire
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
When I felt your touch

Make me feel this time
Spoke like empty words
You're still on my mind
And I oh I wish I felt it
Make me feel this time
Spoke like empty words
You're still on my mind
Find another desire

How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
How did it all change when I felt your touch
When I felt your touch
When I felt your touch
When I felt your touch
When I felt your touch
