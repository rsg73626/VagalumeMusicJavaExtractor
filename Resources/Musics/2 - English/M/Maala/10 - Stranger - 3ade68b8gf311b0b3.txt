STRANGER

Late night waiting for your call
I know I'm tryna keep a hold
You could stop me
Feeling like a stranger
All that I need
Falling for a love I didn't know

And I just wanna know
What it really means to be home
I find myself alone
But I'm really left here at home
And I just wanna know

I know I'm losing all control
I need you to tell me what you want
You could stop me
Feeling like a stranger
All I need
Falling for a love I didn't know

And I just wanna know
What it really means to be home
I find myself alone
But I'm really left here at home
And I just wanna know

I just wanna know x 3

Now it's time to let me know
Now it's time to let it go

And I just wanna know
What it really means to be home
I find myself alone
But I'm really left here at home
And I just wanna know

You could stop me
Feeling like a stranger
(I just wanna know)
All that I need
Falling for a love I didn't know
(I just wanna know)
