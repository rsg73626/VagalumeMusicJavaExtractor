KIND OF LOVE

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
I know what I see
That you're incredible
You've got what I need
And I can't let you go

Sex dreams, touchings, can't breathe
Just need that thing
that you do when you move
Through my head and my bed
You're so bad, I go mad
Just thinking 'bout you
Just thinking 'bout
Just thinking 'bout you
No more conversations

Not us alone, been wasted
When we could go, go places
Cause you belong here with me
No what I want, what could be

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
I know what I see
That you're incredible
You've got what I need
And I can't let you go

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of

Cold sweats, undressed
So stressed, obsessed
Just wanna be right where you are
In the dark with your skin
on my skin, all in
Just thinking 'bout you
Just thinking 'bout
Just thinking 'bout you
No more conversations
Not us alone, been wasted
When we could go, go places
Cause you belong here with me
No what I want, what could be

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
I know what I see
That you're incredible
You've got what I need
And I can't let you go

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
You've got that kind of love
You've got that kind of love
No more conversations

No more conversations

Not us alone, been wasted
When we could go, go places
Cause you belong here with me
No what I want, what could be

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
I know what I see
That you're incredible
You've got what I need
And I can't let you go

You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
You've got that kind of love
You've got that kind of love
No more conversations
