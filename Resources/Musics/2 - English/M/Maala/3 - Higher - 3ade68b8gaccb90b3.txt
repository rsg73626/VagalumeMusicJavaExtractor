HIGHER

We held hope in our lungs for too long
Cold, white walls and the smoke in the lamp light
Never felt so calm, nothing to disarm
Nothing you'd say would change
Couple more down and I know we're gone
All I need to know is where you're staying
All I need to grow is more space
Why'd I let you go I needed your warm embrace
Watch the morning glow I left I know it flakes
I'm taking it higher
I'm taking it higher, I know
Watch the morning glow I left I know it flakes
Drawn right in and the question subsides
Left behind undone and tasteless
Never felt so calm, nothing to disarm
Nothing you'd say would change
Couple more down and I know we're gone
Why'd I let you go I needed your warm embrace
Watch the morning glow I left I know it flakes
I'm taking it higher
I'm taking it higher, I know
Watch the morning glow I left I know it flakes
Long shadow of a new light
Undefined at first
There's an echo in my sigh
Waitin' for a call
Long shadow of a new light
Undefined at first
There's an echo in my sigh, I know
Why'd I let you go I needed your warm embrace
Watch the morning glow I left I know it flakes
I'm taking it higher
I'm taking it higher, I know
Watch the morning glow I left I know it flakes
