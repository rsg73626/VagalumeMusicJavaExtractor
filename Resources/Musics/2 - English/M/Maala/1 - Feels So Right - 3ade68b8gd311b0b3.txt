FEELS SO RIGHT

Saw the coldness in your eyes
Colours turned to black and white
Is it love?
Holding onto every thread
I fantasize until the end

Say it for me one last time
That this ain't what you want
I've been holding out now
For far too long
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right

I can see it take its toll
Nothing left for us to hold
All night long
Softly spoking out of fear
Never felt so unaware

Say it for me one last time
That this ain't what you want
I've been holding out now
For far too long
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right

Say it for me one last time
That this ain't what you want
I've been holding out now
For far too long
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
It feels so right
