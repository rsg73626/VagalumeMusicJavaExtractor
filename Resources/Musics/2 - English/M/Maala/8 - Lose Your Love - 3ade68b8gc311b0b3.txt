LOSE YOUR LOVE

Crawl me down, feeling my imperfection
Conquer crowd in the blood red sky
I can feel in the air this time
I don't if I can change my mind
But, feel the water slowly rise
Feel the pressure
Feel it flowing through my heart
Take it over, feel it tearing you apart
I don't wanna lose your touch
(lose your touch)
I don't wanna lose your love
(lose your love)
I don't wanna cross the line
(lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(your love)
Don't you try to fake that feeling?
The more you try, the less you mean it
You keep me away (?)
And I know I'm loosing sight
But, I can't fight the way I know I'm feeling
Feel the pressure
Feel it flowing through my heart
Take it over, feel it tearing you apart
I don't wanna lose your touch
(lose your touch)
I don't wanna lose your love
(lose your love)
I don't wanna cross the line
(lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(your love)
I don't wanna lose that feeling
I don't wanna (?)
The way you make me tease you, your love
And you got me whipped
A feeling that I can't describe
The way you make me tease you, all night
I don't wanna lose your touch
(lose your touch)
I don't wanna lose your love
(lose your love)
I don't wanna cross the line
(lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(your love, your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(lose your love)
(lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(lose your love)
(your love, your love)
