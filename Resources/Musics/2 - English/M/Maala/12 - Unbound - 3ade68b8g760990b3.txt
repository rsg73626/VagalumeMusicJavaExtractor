UNBOUND

You caught me off guard
Lightning lover
Queen of hearts
Blood red collar
Stop light, lockdown
Day in, day out
Terrified, I want more
Want more than I

It's all I've got
I keep pulling my heart out
It's all I want
I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
I keep pulling my heart out
It's all I want

I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
Empty sky, heavy breather
Crystal clear, burning fever
Stop light, lockdown
Day in, day out
Terrified, I want more
Want more than I

It's all I've got
I keep pulling my heart out
It's all I want
I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
I keep pulling my heart out
It's all I want

I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
Oh, all in my head
Shallow water got me sinking
It's nothing you said
Softer hours got me thinking
Outside tomorrow might be
Shallow water got me sinking
Oh, all in my head, softer hours got me thinking

It's all I've got
I keep pulling my heart out
It's all I want
I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
I keep pulling my heart out
It's all I want
I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
I keep pulling my heart out
I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
I keep pulling my heart out
I wish you to make me feel unbound, don't I
