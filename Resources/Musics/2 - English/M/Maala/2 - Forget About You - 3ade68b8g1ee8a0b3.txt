FORGET ABOUT YOU

She don't like the words I said
Know that anger, feel her grip
I need her out of my head
I want it all done
All my wasted time it's been and gone
I don't care that I'm alone
I was holding on for way too long to say
I, I can forget about you
I can forget about you
I have nothing left to prove
I can forget about you
I can forget about you
What did you ever expect?
I no longer can pretend
None of this makes any sense
I want it all done
All my wasted time it's been and gone
I don't care that I'm alone
I was holding on for way too long to say
I, I can forget about you
I can forget about you
I have nothing left to prove
I can forget about you
I can forget about you
I can forget about you
I'm over dealing with a broken heart
I can forget about you
You think I'm out on all your love
I can forget about you
I, I can forget about you
I can forget about you
I have nothing left to prove
I can forget about you
I, I can forget about you
I can forget about you
I have nothing left to prove
I can forget about you
