MAGIC WORDS

Over the land - over the sea
Waiting for those magic words to come to me
When they come to me

I'll say 'em loud - i'll write 'em down
Writing down those magic words that come to me
When they come to me

They come to me when i'm asleep
And i'll dream those magic words
They come to me when i'm asleep
And i'll dream about those magic words

Ah-woooooooooooooooooo

They come to me when i'm asleep
And i'll dream those magic words
They come to me when i'm asleep
And i'll dream about those magic words

Over the land - over the sea
Waiting for those magic words to come to me
When they come to me

I'll say 'em loud - i'll write 'em down
Writing down those magic words that come to me
When they come to me

Ah-woooooooooooooooooo
