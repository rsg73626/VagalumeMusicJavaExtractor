DEFEATED

Live your own life, just be yourself
Don’t live a lie, for no one else
Don’t live to work, work to live
Give things a go, you might not forgive
Be true to yourself, don’t let you down
Take a chance, when they’re around

oh, oh
You might never reach it, but don’t be defeated [x3]

Life’s a Bitch, then you die
That’s not a way, that’s not a life
When you feel down, bring yourself back
Pressure on you, don’t show the cracks
Enjoy your life, it only comes once
Love your friends, stuff the cunts

oh, oh
You might never reach it, but don’t be defeated [x3]

I’ve had enough of the constant rejection
Every-time you make a selection
Why oh why can’t it be me [x2]
I’ve had enough of the constant failure

Every-time I make a go if it
Why oh why can’t it be me [x2]
I’ve had enough of feeling down
whenever good times come around
why oh why don’t I shut up [x2]

Don’t be defeated [x6]
