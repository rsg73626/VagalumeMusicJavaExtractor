IN YOUR HEAD

When you’re lonely, don’t feel lonely
When you’re sad, don’t feel sad
You can’t run from what’s inside you
Hunt it down and have a conversation
Twist it bend it, fold it back
give it a listen, take a look.
I’ll be here when you need me
I’ll be here when you want me

I’ll be here when you break down
I’ll be here to bring you back
The Voice asks me what is right
The voice keeps me up all night
The voice in my head talks to itself
without help from me or myself
The Voice in your head passes the time
The Voice in your head tells you lies

The Voice in your head is heaven and hell
The Voice in your head keeps you sick and well
The Voice in your head is your guiding light
The Voice in your head is always picking a fight.
The Voice in your head is your best friend
The Voice in your head is there to the end

Shut up, crack up
It might never happen
Shut up, crack up
You know it’ll happen
