JUST LOVE ME

Too many people dying each day
Cos some fat bastard wants pawns for his game
Use them, abuse them, lead them with lies
Use them, abuse them, leave them to die
But do I run and rally to their side?
No, I’m just worried about chat up lines.

Should be getting angry about political Shit
I'm getting down about lack of tit.
I should be getting angry about wankers and arseholes
I'm getting down about fun between bedclothes
I should be getting angry about death in the world
I'm getting down about lack of girls.

Oh, just love me and I'll be angry [x3]

Too many people just sat on their arses
Succumb to commercial catharsis
Ignore the facts ignore the lies
Ignore the world, ignore their lives
But do I do anything about this
I’m just worried about if we should kiss

I should be getting angry about ignorance and hate
I’m getting down about being asked on a date
I should be getting angry about bombing of homes
I’m getting down about being alone
I should be getting angry about Political Apathy 
I’m getting down about why you don’t want to sleep with me

Oh, just love me and I'll be angry [x3]
Not about you, just what should be
Oh just love me and I'll be ranting and raving
About wars over oil and modern crusading
About puppet states at the wars they’re campaigning
About people in power and the mess that they’re making
Oh, just love me and I'll be angry [x3]
