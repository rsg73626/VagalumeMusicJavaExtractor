WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD

Parental blankets did me well
Outside I could never tell
Nothing could prepare me
For what I found away from home
So much beauty
So much cruelty

No one said it would be easy
No one said it would be so hard
There was never a handshake a party or a card
saying, welcome to the real world.

You want to lead a quiet life
it wont let you breathe
You want to lead a busy life
It stops you in your tracks
You want to lead your own life
Be prepared to fight
You want to lead a normal life
But just what is that

No one said it would be easy
No one said it would be so hard
There was never a handshake a party or a card
saying, welcome to the real world.

Welcome to the real world
Welcomes reckless drivers
Welcome to the real world
Best kept global village
Welcome to the real world
Poulation 60bn
Welcome to the real world
Enjoy your stay
