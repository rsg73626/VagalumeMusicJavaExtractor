ONCE IN A BLUE MOON

Once in a blue moon
You will find the right one
Once in a blue moon
Find your dear delight one

And with a thrill
You'll know that love is true
Once in a lifetime
When the moon is blue

Men are called deceivers ever
And women flirt with passion
One true love that last forever
It's sadly out of fashion

Only madness under a pale scar
Flames that turn to ashes and then die
All too soon the lips that kiss
May learn to say goodbye

Once in a blue moon
You will meet the right one
Once in a blue moon
Find your dear delight one

And with a thrill
You'll know that love is true
Once in a lifetime
When the moon is blue
