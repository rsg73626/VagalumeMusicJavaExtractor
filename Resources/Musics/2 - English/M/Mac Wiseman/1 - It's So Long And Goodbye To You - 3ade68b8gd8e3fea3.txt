IT'S SO LONG AND GOODBYE TO YOU

You can send me pretty flowers you can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won?t pay
Leap to my desire, nothing else will do
It?s goodbye and so long to you

You can hang around and love me you can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall but I won?t fall
Kiss me when you?re dreaming, no good that will do
It?s goodbye and so long to you

You can give me your affection you can give all your love
Give me all the things I?ll crave but I?ll be brave
All the things you offer, make me sad and blue
It?s goodbye and so long to you

You can call my your own darling you can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won?t be home
Keep your old love letters, I?m all through with you
It?s goodbye and so long to you
IT'S SO LONG AND GOODBYE TO YOU

You can send me pretty flowers you can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won?t pay
Leap to my desire, nothing else will do
It?s goodbye and so long to you

You can hang around and love me you can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall but I won?t fall
Kiss me when you?re dreaming, no good that will do
It?s goodbye and so long to you

You can give me your affection you can give all your love
Give me all the things I?ll crave but I?ll be brave
All the things you offer, make me sad and blue
It?s goodbye and so long to you

You can call my your own darling you can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won?t be home
Keep your old love letters, I?m all through with you
It?s goodbye and so long to you
