MAY I SLEEP IN YOUR BARN TONIGHT, MISTER?

One night it was dark and 'twas stormy 
And along came a tramp in the rain 
He was making his way to some station 
To catch a long distance train. 

May I sleep in your barn tonight mister 
It is cold lying out on the ground 
And the cold north wind it is blowing 
And I have no place to lie down. 

Oh I have no tobacco or matches 
And I'm sure that I'll do you no harm 
I will tell you my story kind mister 
For it runs through my heart like a thorn. 

It was three years ago last summer 
I shall never forget that sad day 
When a stranger came out from the city 
And said that he wanted to stay. 

One night as I came from my workshop 
I was whistling and singing with joy 
I expected a kind hearted welcome 
From my sweet loving wife and my boy. 

But what should I find I find but a letter 
It was placed in the room on the stand 
And the moment my eyes fell upon it 
I picked it right up in my hand. 

Now this note said my wife and the stranger 
They had left and had taken my son 
Oh I wonder if God up in Heaven 
Only knows what this stranger has done
