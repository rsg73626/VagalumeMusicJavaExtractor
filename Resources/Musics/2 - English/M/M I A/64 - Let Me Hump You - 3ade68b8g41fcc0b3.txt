LET ME HUMP YOU

Let Me Hump You
Let Me Hump You
Let Me Hump You
Baby from the back

To the end I'll be your start
I'll fix your bleeding heart
I'll fix your rum in a glass
I'll fix that girl in the past
I can bring change you can believe in
You can bring change so you can move in
I'm all just so you can see in
My life is where you fit in

Let Me Hump You
Let Me Hump You
Let Me Hump You
Baby from the back

Rock it, Rock it to the stars
Rock it, Rock it to the space
Rock it, Rock it to the bar
I'll get you off your fucking face
If you are going too fast
Stop walking through the broken glass
So just try and have a blast
Try to act like you got class
Walk it, Walk it to your car
Ride it to the other bar
Work it, Work it on that ass
Take it, Take it to the house

Let Me Hump You
Let Me Hump You
Let Me Hump You
Baby from the back

And Imma Bang It Like This
