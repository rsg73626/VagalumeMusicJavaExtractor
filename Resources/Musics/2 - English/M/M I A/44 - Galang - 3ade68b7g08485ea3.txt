GALANG

Lyric by: Larissa Springger
[2x]london calling 
speak the slang now 
boys say wha 
come on girls say what, say wha 

slam, galang galang galang... 
shotgun, get down 
get down, get down, get down 
too late, you down 
d-d-d-down 
ta na ta na ta na 

blaze a blaze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
purple haze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
blaze a blaze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
purple haze (galang a lang a lang lang) 

[2x]who the hell is holding you in the bmw 
how the hell he find you, 147'd you 
the feds gon get you 
pull the strings on the hood 
1 paranoid youth blazin' thru the hood 

blaze a blaze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
purple haze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
blaze a blaze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
purple haze (galang a lang a lang lang) 

[2x]london calling 
speak the slang now 
boys say wha 
come on girls say what, say wha 

[2x]they say 
rivers gonna run though 
work is gonna save you 
pray and you will pull through 
suck a dick'll help you 
don't let em get to you 
if he's got 1 you get 2 
backstab your crew 
sell it i could sell you 

[4x]blaze a blaze (galang a lang a lang lang) 
purple haze (galang a lang a lang lang)
