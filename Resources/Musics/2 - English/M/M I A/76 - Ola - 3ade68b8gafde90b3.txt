"Nants... "
They call me a ruler, trend setter, makin' life feel better
Breaking order like a leader now follow
Poppin' a collar, yea hustle a dollar
You can't touch us like Mc Hammer
Eat my mum's string hoppers, jump in the chopper
Yea, chop up a mango with salt and pepper
Holla, holla, holla, true scholar with the nona
And I'm here to shine the light on the matter

At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola! "
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y. A. L. A. ! "

Baller, a baller, got a friend called Burma
And he looks at Obama when we burner
Turtleneck and bomber, it's a Bamboo Banga
And you know I'm comin' back with power
Yea '64 Impala, Hummer or Toyota
When I drive in I'm a winner
Whatever I'mma rapper got fuel in the burner
Off the grid, staying off the radar

At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola! "
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y. A. L. A. ! "

Yea, shoot at a shooter, yea shoot a computer
Pour yourself a shot of teqkilla
Time for a banger, throw up your middle finger
I'm a writer competition we gon' murder
I'm a fighter and a lover like winter and summer
I ain't really looking for no drama

At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola! "
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y. A. L. A. ! "

Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'mma still do it, I'm a bandit
I'mma still, I'mma still, I'mma still, I'mma still
But I'mma still do it, I'm a bandit
Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'mma still do it, I'm a bandit
I'mma still, I'mma still, I'mma still, I'mma still
But I'mma still do it, I'm a bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit
