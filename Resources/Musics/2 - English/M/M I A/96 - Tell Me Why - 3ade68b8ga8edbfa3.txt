TELL ME WHY

You won't gimmie no mo'
You won't gimmie no mo'
You won't gimmie no mo'
You won't gimmie no mo'
You won't

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

I've been coming up for a while on your radar
And I know I made it just by counting up my haters
I got a speedboat get away like later
You better have a load of cheddar if you don't got data
Cause you can live it up, pull it up, start reeling
Start throwing hands up like you're mad at the ceiling
You could make a killin  but don't forget the feeling
People stealing money and down with double-dealin

You won't gimmie no mo'
You won't gimmie no mo'
You won't

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

You can take me courthouse
You can take me jail
You can take me anywhere
But you can't get me there
You can ask me where I'm going and I'll tell you crazy
But when I get to where I'm going you should come with me
You've be staying up, pull me up start reeling
I'm throwing up my hands like I'm mad at the ceiling

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

I got roots for my head
I got food in my paw
And the old ways are dead with the now ones we got
There's water in my paw
And I'm half in half not
And the old kind is broke with the new kind we bought
I drink alcohol
Know the words to Wonderwall
I read like a code
While I do my time on road

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
