JIMMY

Jimmy, Jimmy and M.I.A.
Come back Jimmy

When you go Rwanda Congo
Take me on a genocide tour
Take me on a truck to Darfur 
Take me where you would go 
Got static on ya satellite phone
Gotta get you safe at home 
Gotta get you somewhere warm 
So you get me all alone 

Jimmy! (Aaja) 
Jimmy! (Aaja) 
Jimmy! (Aaja) 
Jimmy! (Aaja) 

Time and time and time and time again 
You keep pushing that button but I don't know what you're sayin'
You hit me on AIM, tryin' to flip me on some game 
Are you coming, are you going, are you leaving, are you staying? 

You tell me that you're busy 
Your lovin makes me crazy 
I know that you hear me 
Start actin like you want me! 

You tell me that you're busy 
Your lovin makes me crazy 
I know that you hear me 
Start actin like you want me!

Jimmy! (Aaja) 
Jimmy! (Aaja) 
Jimmy! (Aaja) 
Jimmy! (Aaja) 

Time and time and time and time again 
You keep pushing me, what are you sayin?
You hit me on AIM, tryin' to flip me on some game 
But I still don't know what you're sayin

You tell me that you're busy 
Your lovin makes me crazy 
I know that you hear me 
Start actin like you want me! 

You tell me that you're busy 
Your lovin makes me crazy 
I know that you hear me 
Start actin like you want me!
