COME WALK WITH ME

There's a thousand ways to meet you now
There's a thousand ways to track you down
Whatever you said and done
There's a thousand ways to make it count
There is nothing that can touch me now
You can't even break me down
Everytime you think of some
It's already been did it done

Can I be your best friend? Can I make it to the end?
Can you give me some of
What you went and gave them?
Come walk with me
You ain't gotta shake just be with me
You ain't gotta throw your hands in the air
'Coz tonight we ain't acting
Like we don't care
It's cool it takes two, so I'm gonna still fux with you
It's cool it takes two, so I'm gonna still fux with you

There's a thousand ways to meet you now
There's a thousand ways to track you down
Whatever you said and done
There's a thousand ways to make it count
There is nothing that can touch me now
You can't even break me down
Everytime you think of some
It's already been did it done

Can I be your best friend? Can I make it to the end?
Can you give me some of what you went
And gave them?
Come walk with me
You ain't gotta shake just be with me
You ain't gotta throw your hands in the air
'Coz tonight we ain't acting
Like we don't care

Trying to feel like what that feeling's like
When someone makes you feel alright
We can take the same path tonight
For the ride I got plenty of time

What doesn't kill us makes us stronger
That's why my roads get longer and longer
My tracks are less traveled here to Uganda
Can we touch base just to discuss agenda

Can I be your best friend?
Can I make it to the end?
Can you give me some of what you went
And gave them?
Come walk with me
You ain't gotta shake it just be with me
You ain't gotta throw your hands in the air
'Coz tonight we ain't acting
Like we don't care

It's cool it takes two, so I'm gonna still fux with you
It's cool it takes two, so I'm gonna still fux with you

Back, back, back
Power, power, power
Back, back, back
Power, power, power
Back, back, back
Power, power, power
M. I. A. coming back with power, power
