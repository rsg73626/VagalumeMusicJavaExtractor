STORY TO BE TOLD

I licked envelopes
Wrote a letter to the pope
He never gave me rope
In the times I couldn't cope

They cleaned up the dope
And censored my scope
The writing on the walls
Been beaten to a pulp

All I ever wanted was my story to be told
I never got struck by something in my core
I never took back that joint I rolled
What happens now the truth I told

Do they all roll over and die in the cold
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
A skate board rolled, a lightning bolt
Droppin' on 'em

But it ain't their fault
Maybe I am floored
But it needs to be told
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
