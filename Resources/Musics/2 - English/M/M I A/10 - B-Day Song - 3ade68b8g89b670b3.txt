B-DAY SONG

And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday

And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world

Light my candles, gotta make a wish
Wrap up the present and seal it with a kiss
Give me a spanking, start the day off right
Cuz it's my day, you're gonna sing my song tonight

And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl

My type of party, there's no hangover
So many things you better come over
We get high and we still stay sober
We throw it down and then we start over
My type of party, there's no hangover

And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world

I want a diamond, don't give me a fake
I'll let you lick the frosting off my cake
Give me a spanking, start the day off right
Cuz it's my birthday, you'll be singing my song tonight

And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl
In my happy world
I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl
