MUDERSOUNDS MUNCHI

To my bedroom to the hallway
To the hallway to the alleyway
To the alleyway to the freeway
To the freeway to the highway

But here's something from me
It's music

That's why we like that

The future backwards spells "are you tough?" (er u tuf)
The future backwards spells "are you tough?
That's why we do this, we do that
That's why we do this
It's the music

Pump up on the beat(s)

I'm not saying be free
I'm saying it should it be freer
I'm not saying it should be freer
I'm saying the music should be free

It's my wagger
