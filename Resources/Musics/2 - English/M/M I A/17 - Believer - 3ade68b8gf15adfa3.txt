BELIEVER

Really would like to see the light shine
Water run down from my eye (light shine)
All day
There's a mainstream with the main dreams

But waterfalls start with a little stream
Even Kubrick started with a small scene
Before it became The Shining

If your coming from the hood work on getting knowledge
If your from the front line and you wanna survive
I didn't choose the battles but the battles choose me

From the bullet hitting my cousin, we'll see
I've been in the game now 5.3
Little shorty bird got shorties after me
I stay humble cause the shit I seen

Cos I already know theres only one me
I really would like to see the stars shine
But I like getting covered up in hard times
I need to let loose

If the water ran dry fill it up with juice
All day, need a believer
There's no mean & there's more me

Every tree started with a little bean
Everything you go through at 17 -
Will it still count at 70?
If I'm coming from the street then I'm getting money

But my deals in the bank are well planning
I didn't choose the music but the music chose me
The art hitting your speakers making it bleed
I been thinking bout what affects me

The will to survive is always in me
Every glass of water grows, what I be?
And every glass of liquor gets me tipsy
I really would like to see the stars shine

But I like getting covered up in hard times
I need to let loose
If the water ran dry fill it up with juice
All day, need a believer

It's about people, not money
Light up the parliament, turn the car key
I could be a genius, I could be a cheat
It's a thin line and I'm fucking with it

I didn't choose this topic but this topic chose me
I'm dancing on the rubble permanently
I'm cut from a cloth that you made me
Driving down the alley these cats know me

It's not cool, then we bring heat
If there's no heat then it's discreet
If it's got your feet, then it's on me
Anything on NEET has got that beat
