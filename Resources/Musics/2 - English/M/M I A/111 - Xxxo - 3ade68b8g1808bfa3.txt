XXXO

Time after time
You been coppin' mine, but
Can I have a good time at yours tonight
Cause every time
We try to get close
There is always something big I'm thinking about

(You want me)
XXXO

You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not

A knock at the door
And then we hit the floor
And all I know is you leave me wanting more

I don't let it show
But I think you know
Cause you're tweeting me like Tweety Bird on your iPhone

(You want me)

You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me be
Somebody who I'm really not
