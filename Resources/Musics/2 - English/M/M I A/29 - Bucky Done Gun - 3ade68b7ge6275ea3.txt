BUCKY DONE GUN

London 
Quiet down and I need to make a sound 
New York 
Quiet down and I need to make a sound 
Kingston 
Quiet down and I need to make a sound 
Brazil 
Quiet down and I need to make a sound 

They’re comin break the window
They’re comin break the door
They’re bustin down the big wall
And sounding in the Four

They’re comin break the window
They’re comin break the door
They’re bustin down the big wall
And sounding in the hall

(refrão) (2X)
What do you want?
Bucky done gun
What do you want?
The fire done fun
What do you want?
Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get get crackin'

Time to spare, new shit
I’m rocking on this new bed
I’m hot now you’ll see
I’ll bite you just to get peace
Heavy way, wrestler
Fight me in the comfort ah
Let you be superior
I’m filthy with the fury ya

Kingston 
Quiet down and I need to make a sound 
Brazil
Quiet down and I need to make a sound 

I’ll hard drive your bit
I’m battered by your sumo grip
Lucky I like feeling shit
My stamina can take it
Gymnastics super fit
Muscles on the gun clip
Bite, teeth, nose bleed
Time to be in the scarf peace

What do you want?
Bucky done gun
What do you want?
The fire done fun
What do you want?
Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get get crackin'

Can I get control
Do you like me vulnerable
I’m armed and I’m equal
More fun for the people
Physical, brute force
Steel, iron, you’re the boss
Yeah, you’re so do-able
Grind me down sugar salt

Bucky done gun
What do you want?
The fire done fun
What do you want?
Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get get crackin'
