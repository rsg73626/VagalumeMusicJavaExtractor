LISTEN UP

All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
Excuse me! What's the problem here?
What about you can't hear the words I say.
Excuse me! What's the problem here?
What about you can't hear all the words I say.
If you listen up, you can hear me all day.
All I ever talk about is keeping fresh way.
Keeping my sway.
Keeping my A. A. A. A.
I sway all day.

You can come on your own or
You can have the crew.
You can step up like a man and
I'll dance with you.
You can thank me later or
Have an attitude.
If you don't feel me now,
You'll never feel me boo.

Excuse me! What's the problem here?
What about me that you can't seem to hear.
If you listen up you can hear me all day.
All I ever talk about is keeping fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh sway.
Sway. Sway. Sway all day.
Sway, sway, sway, sway, sway

All fucking day
All I ever talk about is
My fresh-ish, ish my fresh-ish,
Ish my fresh-ish, ish my fresh-ish
Ish my fresh-ish....

Excuse me! What's the problem here?
What about me that you can't seem to hear.
If you listen up, you can hear me all day.
All I ever talk about is keeping fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh way.
All I ever talk about is my fresh sway.
Sway. Sway. Sway all day
Sway, sway, sway, sway, sway...

All fucking day.
All I ever talk about ish my fresh-ish,
Ish my fresh-ish, ish my fresh-ish
Ish my fresh-ish, ish my fresh ish.
