North, south, east, west
Everybody there
Water, water, water, water
Where me water there?
Need to breathe, need to breathe
This bubble needs some air
Ah-ah-air
Need to get some air

Fresh and clean like January
Here's that credit itintery
Playing that game, get your referee
Victory is necessary
Hide your ones like bitchionary
But, you know me
I keep it clean
I don't like doing things I don't really mean
That's my team, sport or win
We don't give a fuck 'bout reppin' green
Kicking down the doors, get your scene
I'm going to be your chick supreme

Make you scream for the dream
Do it clean, spin your wheels
I stitched your seams, sew what you mean
So what if I want a world to gleam?
Part of the team, you're part of the theme
If you want change, then you gotta go in
