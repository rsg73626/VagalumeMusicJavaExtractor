Ya'll just so metrosexual
This is not my political correct flow
This is more like letting them tecks blow
This is more like a left when they say right
When the world do you wrong but you play right
This is more like pushing that white rock
When the world try to put you in a tight box
Coming up in the drop with the system bang
Cuz you don't give a fuck what the system think
Ya'll comin up Mi, Mi, Mia
Semi spray
When you in my way
Ima be who I'm goin be
I'm just a boy from the hood
What you want from me
