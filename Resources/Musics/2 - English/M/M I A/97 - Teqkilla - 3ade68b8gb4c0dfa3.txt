TEQKILLA

Down the drain, down the drain, down the drain,
down down down down down, make it drop down the drain.

"We squeeze, we sniff, we cut it up, to give you the ultimate..."

Oh, it's M.I.A., Oh, woah. It's M.I.A., woah. It's M.I.A, woah.
Rock it, just rock it rock it two for the stage, two the bars, woah.

Johnny keep walking, Jack is too coked,
Jim Beam and Jameson? They just give me jokes,
When I see Pernot I say oh hell no,
Kahlua's a turnoff, I tell him to Smirnoff,
Cap'n Morgan jump up for sparks(?)
when we hang out he shoots arrows through my heart,
Blue Tattoo chillin' on Malibu,
he got 99 Bananas, but he's not my boo.

I got sticky-sticky-icky-icky weed,
I've got a shot of tequila in me.
I got sticky-sticky-icky-icky weed,
I've got a shot of tequila in me.

When I met Seagram he sent Chivas down my spine,
got me on the dancefloor and we started to wine,
His ex Sambuca, she just a hookah,
I put it on the chilla,
but I want to kill'a.

[?]I got you off your fucker-face,
I tell you what you do, you want your mother, you something-or-another,
I got you off your fucking face, you're half turned to another place,
Your brother, you fucking nutter.[/?]
I got sticky-sticky-icky-icky weed,
I've got a shot of tequila in me.(x10)

Whatchu say, eh? Eh eh? (chant)
