The... hate me like a monday, tuesday's my d-day know that

Double dare me, double dare you back, 
I dare you every time we're that
Cha cha cha cha, or ola ola ola ola
Double dare me, double dare you back,

Kiss and i'll kiss you back, i got to keep on going
You zig me and i'll zag you back, i got to keep on going
You tuck me and i'll tuck you back, i got to keep on going
You kiss me and i'll kiss you back, i got to keep on going
Oh oh oh oho, oh oh oh oho, i bite back
Oh oh oh oho, oh oh oh oho, i bite back

And check me in for my resume, thanks... my mom and dad
Hot spicy like the... over there toilet that way
Run away if you can't stop me
Cha cha cha cha, or ola ola ola ola
Double dare me, double dare you back, 
i dare you every time we're that
Kiss and i'll kiss you back, i got to keep on going
You zig me and i'll zag you back, i got to keep on going
You tuck me and i'll tuck you back, i got to keep on going
You kiss me and i'll kiss you back, i got to keep on going
Kiss and i'll kiss you back, i got to keep on going
You zig me and i'll zag you back, i got to keep on going
You tuck me and i'll tuck you back, i got to keep on going
You kiss me and i'll kiss you back, i got to keep on going
