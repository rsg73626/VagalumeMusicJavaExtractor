FIRE FIRE

Lyric by: Larissa Springger
Growin up, Brewin Up 
Guerilla gettin trained up 
look out look out 
From over the Rooftop 

Growin up, Brewin Up 
Guerilla gettin trained up 
Look out Look out 
From over the rooftop 

Competition coming up now 
Load up, 
Aim, 
Fire Fire, 
Pop 

Competition coming up now 
Load up, 
Aim, 
Fire Fire, 
Pop 

Row Da Boat - Straight to da ocean 
Give 'im a run - A run at his own game 
Signal the plane - An' I landed on the runway 
A survivor, independant foreigner 

First your beats had me running to the running man 
Then your chat had me wanna do the bogie man 
click suits and booted in the timberland 
Freakin out to Missy on a Timbaland 


Growin up, Brewin Up 
Guerilla gettin trained up 
Look out Look out 
From over the rooftop 

Growin up, Brewin Up 
Guerilla gettin trained up 
Look out Look out 
From over the rooftop 


Competition coming up now 
Load up, 
Aim, 
Fire Fire, 
Pop 

Competition coming up now 
Load up, 
Aim, 
Fire Fire, 
Pop 

You shoulda been good to me 
Then I wouldn't get so rowdy rowdy 
You shoulda kept ya eye on me 
Then I wouldn't get so baddy baddy 

Whether you are... 
Swinging out to Swing beat 
Laying low and jacking-up to Lou Reed 
Chasin out to Pixies and the Beasties 
Doin aceed with Hair-Coloured Geek Freaks 
FFWD onto the' 04 
Got my own flow get you to the dance floor 
Little mamma doin the booty rolls 
crump clowns got me rootin for the linos
