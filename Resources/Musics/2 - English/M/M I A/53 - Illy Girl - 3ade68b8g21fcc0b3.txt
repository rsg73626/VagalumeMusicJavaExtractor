ILLY GIRL

Shirts, tops, tees
I'm always in tight jeans
I know Billie Jean and Bruce Springsteen
I know Palestine and Mujahideen
Playing Tekken on the weekend eating mangosteen
Lean mean machine
Kinda stream with my team
I'm from England from Mitcham near Cheam
Have you heard my dream?
Even Martin Luther's king
So I put it down on my track
Explain what it means

I'm not talking about getting it for free
I'm talking about making it freer
