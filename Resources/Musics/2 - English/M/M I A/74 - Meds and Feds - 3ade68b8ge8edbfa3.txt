MEDS AND FEDS

I just give a damn

Who says all the rules are made with rulers?
We break em and break in their computers
I ain't buying no more from them looters
Who try to out school us
So we jump on our scooters
I hope you understood us


I just give a damn

Hocus pocus, but you can't take away our focus
We're growing up in middle of the digital ruckus
You can say fuck us, I ain't putting on the stoppers
We could be hackers making it like Lakers
While we become workers you become golfers
The modern day coppers beating on us for the papers

I just give a damn
