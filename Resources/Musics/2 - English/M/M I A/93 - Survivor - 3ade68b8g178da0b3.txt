SURVIVOR

My time in the fire
Cause ain't gonna tell ya
(This war is never over)
I ride through the sea like a pirate
Just to float in the water

Can't carry feelings
Like basket can't carry water
Ain't gonna tell ya
That I live strictly for the paper
Men are good, men are bad
And the war is never over

Survivor, who said it was easy?
Survivor, they can never stop we

G. O. D
Gold and oil and dollars
Stars come and go
Just like every empire
I stay fly focus
I'm staying higher
Apparently lighter
From you know you a survivor

Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy? They can never stop we
Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?

Watch yourself mad nova
Heading over
Watch yourself mad nova

It starts when you ready
It starts when you ready

Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy? They can never stop we
Survivor, survivor
