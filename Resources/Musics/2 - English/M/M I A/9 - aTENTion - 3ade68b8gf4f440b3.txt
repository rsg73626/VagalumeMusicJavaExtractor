ATENTION

[Verse 1]
The fullest exTENT of my inTENT
is to let you know what is imporTENT
My exisTENTS is miliTENT
cause my conTENT bangs like it's poTENT
ResisTENT to the polluTENT
never hesiTENT, always consisTENT
I back it up, yeah I'm very blaTENT
Don't try to copy this cause I paTENT
Runnin on the streets causing TENTsion
Like Running through the streets
Runnin on the streets causing TENTsion, like "atTENTion! "

[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!

[Verse 2]
I got to see my life from a disTENTS
For insTENTS, my friends say I act TENTS
I'm a refugee from a yellow brick TENT
Past TENT present TENT and future TENT

For atTENTion about my TENT

[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!

[Outro]
Things fall on our heads like we're newTENT
So don't drop that ball on that buTENT
We're aliens but we're not muTENT

While you dance in your LoubouTENT
We be makin' TENT out ya curTENT
