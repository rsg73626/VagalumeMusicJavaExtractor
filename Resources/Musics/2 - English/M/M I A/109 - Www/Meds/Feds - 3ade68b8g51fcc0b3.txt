With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward

Who said all the rules are made with rulers
We break 'em and break in their computers
I ain't buying no more from them looters
Who try to out school us
So we jump on our scooters
I hope you understood us
When we say

We don't make that money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence
We don't make that money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence

Do you know me punk?
I'd do you punk

With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward

They say I pick big battles with the government
Immigration departments
For the people who live in the tenements
Our voices carry our sentiments
We sprinkle your coffee with the cinnamon
We're made of ladies and gentlemen
From the street to [?]
We could take on all your nations
