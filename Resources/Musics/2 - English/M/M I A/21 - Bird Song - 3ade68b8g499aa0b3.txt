BIRD SONG

I'm a parrot
I'm robin this joint
Not a lyre bird
Sure ain't a vulture
Don't swallow that cause I make the culture
I'm not a lyre bird
Staying rich like an ostrich

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying rich like an ostrich

Drop down get your eagle on
Like a falcon
Fly phenomena
Humming higher than a drone
Doves cry
Are you going home alone
Squad flock
Migrate for the summer
Duck out for some hot weather
Birds of prey and I'm shaking off my feather
I believe like R. Kelly we can fly
But toucan fly together
Staying rich like an ostrich

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying rich like an ostrich

Now watch the sky
Is that a crow on a crain?
Is that you or a plane?
Where's your chicken at?
I'm watching like a hawk
Gully like a seagull
I'm coo coo for you let's talk!

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying rich like an ostrich

My love comes in silence
Through ideals and violence
Don't want to have to prove it's true
Like gods in the science
In your caged existence
My wings made the difference
Take off find your balance
Cause staying in love is the challenge
