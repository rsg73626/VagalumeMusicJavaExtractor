GO OFF

No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong

People love position
So I stay way up on a level
Like my name is Neymar
and you know I'm not normal
There is no competition
I'm gonna talk and you gonna listen
I'm on ten like men, even better than them
Yeah I don't lose focus
like a German called Sven
My third eye's open
and my focus ain't joking
Yeah You got it wrong, cause my focus is so strong

Run-pama pama pa-pama pama pama
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong

Yeah I'm pressing buttons
Dropping pins on positions
Cause my words go far
And this rain is so foreign
You blow the place I live in while
Watch I could keep it going
Go off on em
Go off on em

So check up on your messages
Know what the message is
Like aliens in villages
We're here for all ages
Fans back home
Got my tracks bang on
Yeah you got it wrong
Cause my focus is so strong

Run-pama pama pa-pama pama pama
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong

At least you tell your children I came from London
Start talking about me long time
like she was random
When I was in your life fella, I was hella bomb
But I had to go off just to stay strong

Run-pama pama pa-pama pama pama
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
