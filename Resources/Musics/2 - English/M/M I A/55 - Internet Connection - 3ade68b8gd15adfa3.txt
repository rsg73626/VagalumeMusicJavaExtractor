INTERNET CONNECTION

When I'm on the phone
I get no reception here
Miss, would you be interested in switching onto a month of service providings
to a provider that provides a better service of internet service
providing than your current provider
....uh

I was walking down the street
And the buildboards seemed to stare
And the purses seemed to date
And dated what they did wear
And the buildings on the bankquet

You dresses it so here
When I'm on the phone
Theres no reception here
You don't understand me
You don't know my game
I say "whats the malfunction?"
You say "the internet connection!"

I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin out of my mind

The system shutted down
They tried to take what found
I'm holdin shit around town
Tryin to hold me down

I'm standing at the station
In need of education
Its the medicated nation
We can't be more patient

You don't understand me
You don't know my game
I say "whats the malfunction?"
You say, "the internet connection!"

I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin out of my mind
Dude

Something dude
Something dude
Dude something

I'll date you
I'll take you a while
I'll peck him on the lips
I'll take him on my hips

These geeks are just freaks
And I got em on my flip
I'm gettin off the computer
I'm going to do something

Yeah something
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin out of my mind

You got the beat
Turn it up
You got to give it to me
