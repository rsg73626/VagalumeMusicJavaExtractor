What you say when you say "Have a good day"
Da-da-da-dang,
Ga-dan-da-dee-dang,
What you say when you say "Have a good day"
Da-da-da-dang,
Ga-dan-da-dee-dang,
If you're gonna follow, then here's a new way!

Your poor ain't poor and your tough ain't tough
The girls on my block, they always have it rough
Flip-flop,
Braids and bash, you can ride it like a truck, truck

When I dangle my bangle, cookin' up a scandal
When the girls are real, their hair is in the tangle
The night's so hard, the sex burnt the candle
Set it on fire-- I can man-handle!
