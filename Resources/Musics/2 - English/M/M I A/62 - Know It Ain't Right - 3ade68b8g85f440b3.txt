KNOW IT AIN'T RIGHT

[Verse 1]
Let me take the time to tell you
I already know whats on your mind
I wanna stick around and make you
Understand I didn't commit crime
But you keep on thinking it's
In some other chick
Makes me feel I'm better off
Goin' on a trip
You keep on thinking it's
In some other bitch
That makes me wanna leave
And never call up 'til I'm rich

[Hook]
What you want come see me
I got bootleg love for free
I got Abdul in a taxi and
He'll drop you down for free
Natsumi and Tsunami
They make love like origami
They put a flower on the lover
Give it good licky lick what
Good licky lick, good licky lick
We know it ain't right but we do it anyway

[Verse 2]
I think I wanna get a little active
There's more to this than being your captive
New directions might need a little practice
I can make it a little less destructive
You putting guards up
Outside my shop
Get me with your swat what
And it don't it don't stop
You putting guards up
Outside my shop
Get me with your swat what
And it don't it don't stop

[Interlude]
Ay, ay, ay

[Hook]

[Outro]
We do it anyway, but we do it anyway
