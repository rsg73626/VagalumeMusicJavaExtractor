SPACE ODYSSEY

Gravity is my enemy
It grabs on me like im money
The stars are banging close to me
As I?m floatin in my life odyssey

My lines are down and you can?t call me
As I float around in space odyssey
My lines are down and you can?t call me
As I float around in space odyssey

Like puzzle bubble on pc
It?s got color were it?s followin me
And I still judge you week by week
And I?m heade the time you can never lose me

My lines are down and you can?t call me
As I float around in space odyssey
My lines are down and you can?t call me
As I float around in space odyssey
Ah ah ah ah ah, (....)

You might take a minute or two
To introduce my point of view
I need to spend some time with you
There is nothing more new one can do
My lines are down and you can?t call me
As I float around in space odyssey
My lines are down and you can?t call me
As I float around in space odyssey
