FOREIGN FRIEND

[Dexta Daps:]
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah!

[M.I.A.:]
There ain't nothing to it
With the friend I keep it cool with
Love it, we been through it
Stick it like glue, now chew it
Bad girls, hands up
Ride or die how we feel it
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
If you can't then screw it

Gonna be your best friend
Gonna make that shit trend
I'm gonna be your foreign friend all the way to the end

[Dexta Daps:]
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma need you like your best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma squeeze you like my best friend
(Go best friend, go best friend)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah!

[M.I.A.:]
You can be my best friend
You know too much to be a foe
You were there from before
In the days when I had no dough
Break bread, watch Breaking Bad
Always there when I break up bad
In bed, feeling so sad
You were always there as a comrade
I know you think like me
Life ain't easy for the people like we
Say life's a box of chocolates
We say who packed it, do you feel me?
What you do's none of my business
But I want you to make me a witness
Wanna witness the greatness
Cause we best friends through health and sickness

Gonna be your best friend
Gonna make that shit trend
I'm gonna be your foreign friend all the way to the end

[Dexta Daps:]
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma treat you like your best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
