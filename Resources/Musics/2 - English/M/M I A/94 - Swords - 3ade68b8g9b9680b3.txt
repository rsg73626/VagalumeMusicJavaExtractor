SWORDS

You say you love the coco (Hey)
They say they love their boko (M. I. A.)
Some say fuck all (Hey)
But I'm here to take all

[Hook]
Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
I'm here to take you there because you act like you forgot

[Verse 2]
Highly explosive, ready and raw
Everything banging like we're in Bangalore
Sounds of swords cutting edge like woah
Toyota truck, pick us up, let's go!

Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
I'm here to take you there because you act like you forgot

[Verse 3]
Loads of guys can't handle this ride
When would they know we're best by their side
They keep us down and we take it in stride
Throw up your head if you've still got light
What we know because we just can't hide
[?] would know, cut the money we find
Yeah it's time, we better get behind
Pass the stars and you can't hit rewind

We them girls, say holla holla holla
We hold the world, say holla holla holla

Hands up
If you hear a knock on the door
Hands up
