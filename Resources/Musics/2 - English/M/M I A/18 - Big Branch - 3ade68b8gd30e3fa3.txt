BIG BRANCH

Big bad wolf
Came over to my ranch
Took all my land
Left me with a branch
That's how I felt about the
Loving that I had
That I know about the girls he had

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
Put her on the table
And put her in my claw
I'll put her down in my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And drop her to the floor

Big branch

Men are like pearls
They look good with my curls
I string em to get the best necklace in the world
In the states of the world
All women wanna lay
But it's man's world so keep him at bay
You can fuck a man, mack a man
Tell 'em that you're gay
Tell him real love ain't on BET
Sex is so cheap, I get it at KFC
When its meaningless why they do R&B

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
Put her on the table
And put her in my claw
I'll put her down in my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And drop her to the floor

Big branch

I ate my chips and I washed my plate
Thought about women that take that bait
Men with stamina or money on the plate
Can get a woman thinking her period is late
Thanks to Jesus, I got my own estate
If I let you in, will you run off with my maid?
All men are just so fickle these days
To find a really good one
I keep on getting laid

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
Put her on the table
And put her in my claw
I'll put her down in my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And drop her to the floor
