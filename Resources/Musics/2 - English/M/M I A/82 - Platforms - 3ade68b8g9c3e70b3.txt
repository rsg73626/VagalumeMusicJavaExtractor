PLATFORMS

Neon lights on the dust on the ground on the bus
Dirty roads makes that scarf wrap a must
Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app
Data mine my mind like a diamond in the ruff

Platforms here's a train of thought
Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what else have I got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

Guns keep it fun, keep it mad, keep it on the run

If oil is the God, then the cranes all pray
The crude is so rude cause it makes the people pay
On the side of the men make money
A flower for a dollar man, he wants a family
If I rose to power, I'll be a bouquet
Emoji a smiley, and say I'm okay
The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day
cause talking is cheap, cause they make it easy

Platforms here's a train of thought
Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what else have I got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

Guns keep it fun, keep it mad, keep it on the run
Guns keep it fun, keep it mad on the run
Those who love me, here comes the sound
Power to the people, yeah the light is never done
Switch on for the bitches, yeah electricity fun
Politics, new kicks, [?] up a new pic
[?] countries by the way they do clicks
[?] I'm a beat, don't skip
This ode is gonna flow now, jumping with this real chick

Platforms here's a train of thought
Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what else have I got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not
