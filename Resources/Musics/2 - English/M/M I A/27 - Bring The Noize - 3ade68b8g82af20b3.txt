BRING THE NOIZE

Free them, free them, free them, free them
Freedom, freedom

I'm so tangy, people call me Mathangi
Goddess of word, bitches, I'm a keep it banging
Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out
Let the bottom two
Let my wisdom work it out
Big on the underground, can't knock me down
Vicki Leekx bitches, better buy it on demand
I think by my ten and I stand by two
I can say lots with little words or few like
I done had 'em, yeah, me the madame
I'll introduce you do the zundum zudums
Come let me go, do you like my perfume?
Made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes

We like fucking carpets, you like fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs they're adding on Bing
My cousins got his DCS he's decorating
He's handy you might need him
When I'm finishing what I'm saying
Let's be frank, you must damn understand
I don't care what you smell what you fucking drank
A lot to be pissed, their mates we were yanks
'Cause it's not me and you, it's the fucking banks

Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them

Free them, free them, free them, free them
Freedom, freedom

Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out
Let the bottom two
Let my wisdom work it out
The word is out, sending yours on the prow
Words unannounced
Hope you heard 'em like cows
Have the canny body, worth a tally and a wrench
Bitch, my swag rich, can't touch this
So click, click, click, lose it off my dick
Just 'cause I'm numb it don't make me thick
Got my overweight, heavyweight, be my slave freak
If you need the cheese
Then my shit cost stake
I got a bug spray, bucket, stick
Tons of the fun stuff and and tons of it

Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them
Bring the noise when we run upon them

Free them, free them, free them, free them
Freedom, freedom

Free them, free them, free them, free them
Free them, free them, free them, free them

Freedom's just another word
Nothing like the new
Freedom's just another word
Nothing like the new
Freedom's just another word
Nothing like the new
Freedom's just another word
Nothing like the new
