SUNSHOWERS

I bongo with my lingo
and beat it like a wing yo
To congo to colombo
Cant stereotype my thing yo
I salt and pepper my mango
Shoot split
Out the window
Bingo I got em in the thing yo
Now what? I'm doing my thing yo
Quit bending all my fingo
Quit beating me like you're ringo
You wanna go?
You wanna win a war?
Like P.L.O. I dont surrendo
(Chorus - Cherry)
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cos I'm watching you my baby
I Bongo
With my lingo
And eat it like a wing yo
To congo 
To colombo
Cant stereotype my thing yo
I checked that mouth on him
Fucking checked that gas on him 
I had him
Cornered him
Fucking shut that gate on him
Why would you listen to him?
He had his way I'm bored of him 
I'm tired of him
I don't wanna be as bad as him
It's a bomb yo
So run yo
Put away your stupid gun yo
Cos we see through like a protocol call 
That' s why we blow it up 'fore we go
(Chorus - Cherry)
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cos I'm watching you my baby
Semi-9 and snipered him
on that wall they posted him
They cornered him
and then just murded him
He told them he didn't know them
He wasn't there they didn't know him
They showed him a picture then
Ain't that you with the muslims?
He had colgate on his teeth
And Reebok classics on his feet
At a factory he does nike
And then helps the family
Beat heart beat
He's made it to the newsweek
Sweetheart seen it
He's doing it for the peeps. Peace
(Chorus - Cherry)
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cos I'm watching you my baby
