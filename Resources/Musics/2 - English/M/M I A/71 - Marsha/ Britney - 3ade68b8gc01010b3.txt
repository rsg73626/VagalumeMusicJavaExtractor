MARSHA/ BRITNEY

I've got imitators, haters and some psychos
but what I hate most is bitches who are fame hoes
seen them at the party posting for photos
She don't think about the world past painting toes
This girl is been doing rounds at the local mall
elevated ??? of doing dudes in rock and roll
pretty face character deadly like a ..
she always claims she's part native Navajo
He's kinda isn't dressed from head to toe in black
His stylish straight whack off a magazine rack
Buy it post link it spread it ready and read it
You're always on my space coz you need phone credit

You wanna be the next big thing, "it" thing
Do anything.... but you can't sing

Hey Marsha!
What'd you do yesterday?
Coz when I read the blog story
Don't add up to what you told me
Hey Marsha!
What'd you do yesterday?
What I read on your blog story
Don't add up to what you told me

You want to be a model for American Apparel
It's apparent that yourself is way dumber than Cowell
You want high fashion so you worked at Fashion High
Cocaine kept you talking most of it a fucking lie
Your shoes could feed a village
You should think about that
Facebook face facts can you know that
Bla bla bla bla bla .. girl you should post that

Hey Marsha!
What'd you do yesterday?

Don't add up to what you told me
