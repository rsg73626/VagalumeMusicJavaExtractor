PULL UP THE PEOPLE

Lyrics by: Larissa Springger
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor
Pull up the poor,pull up the poor

Slang tang
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang 
(X 2)

Yeah,me got God and me got you
Every day thinking bout how me get through
Everything i own is on I.O.U.
But i'm here to bringing you
Someting new

You no like the people,they no like you
Then they go and set it off
With a big Boom
Every gun in a battle is a
Son and daughter too

So why you wanna talk about
Who done who?
Why you wanna talk about

Slang tang
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang 
(X 2)

Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor 
Pull up the people,pull up the poor
Pull up the poor,pull up the poor

I'm a fighter,fighter God
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter,a nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road
You can bring me the reaper
Bring me the lawyer
Iâ€™m a fighter,i'll take em on
You treat me like a killer
I ain't hate ya.

I'm a fighter,fighter God
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter,a nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road

Slang tang
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang bang bang

Slang tang
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it

Slang tang
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang bang bang

Slang tang
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang
