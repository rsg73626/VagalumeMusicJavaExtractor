Daddy can be rough
That's why I can be tough
Kicks in even when it comes to little bit of love
On the ground to be stuffed
Police put me in cuffs
I ain't a victim but
I am a diamond in the rough

I'm illegal
Above the law
Shirts, tops, tees
I'm always in tight jeans
I know Billie Jean and the Bruce Springsteen
I also know Palestine and Mujahideen
Playin' Tekken on tha weekend eating mango sleeves

I'm illegal
Above the law

We be machine
I the stream with my team
I'm from England from Mitcham near Cheam
Have you heard my dream?
Even Martin Luther's king
So put it down and imma try explain what it means
I'm illegal
Above the law (2x)
