OVERDRIVE

Girl say, girl say, girl say, boy say, girl say
boy say, girl say, boy say
In the car, in the car, in the car, out the car
in the car, out the car, in the car, out the car
I'm stylin', stylin', ravin', ravin', stylin', ravin', stylin', ravin'
Overdrive
Overfly
Overdrive
Overfly
Overdrive
Overfly
Overdrive
Overfly

When I was young my style was so different
I had already begun even 'fore I hit London
My... [?] had the boys with the toy gun
But I already had real ones
So I found new ways for me to have fun

Girl say, girl say, girl say, boy say, girl say
boy say, girl say, boy say
In the car, in the car, in the car, out the car
in the car, out the car, in the car, out the car
I'm stylin', stylin', ravin', ravin', stylin', ravin', stylin', ravin'

We don't make the money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence
