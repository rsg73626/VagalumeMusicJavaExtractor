WHAT I GOT

I was bored
I need a new drug
Everybody bitin' shit
Gettin' fucked up
M.I.A. rollin' wit Blaqstarr
Anyone talking shit
I'm gonna blow em all up

Who's mad, who's crazy, who's fucked up?
It's about time I rack em all up
More fire, more power, more wound up
I'm the queen of this shit
Don't bother steppin' up

Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule

What I got you can't get from ya mama
What I got you can't get from ya ho

I got alien aphrodisiacs
I found visiting planets of the zodiac
Got a six pack so you don't get side track
I'll be in Baltimore tonight on the amtrack

Got a Mac with PCP for ya lap
Same effects as LSD and smack
Boom boom I'm bringin you the new crack
Like a club track made from Iraq

What I got you can't get from ya mama
What I got you can't get from ya ho

Get to you in high tech pro tool
Woop woop chop screw in hotels
Club cars in the street front of people
At home we can play some scruples
But tonite I'll wait 'til the nightfall
Like a ninja glide over waterfalls
Get to you to give you a lil rock and roll
Tap tap that bed to the wall
Tap tap that bed to the wall
