BAD GIRLS

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Suki Zuki
I'm coming in the Cherokee
Gasoline 
There's steam on the window screen

Take it, take it
World's bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you trembling

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Yeah, back it, back it
Yeah, pull up to the bumper game
With a signal
Cover me, cause I'm changing lanes

Had a handle on it
My life, I broke it
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you saying it

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on...

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Going knot the bitch, I see four million
Accelerating fast, I could do this in a second
Looking in a rear view, swagging going swell
Leaving boys behind, cuz it's legal just to kill
Shift gear, automatic, damned if I do
Who's gonna stop me, when I'm coming through
What we've got left is just me and you by
If I get it bad baby, can I take you?

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on...
