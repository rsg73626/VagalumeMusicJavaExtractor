LIKE THIS

I could give it to you like this
Give it to you like that
Give it to you like this
Give it to you like that

People they come for
Want a piece of what I got
Got the key in my coat
Got a secret, do you want more?

Pick a home, pick a door, pick a lock
Pick a club, pick a fold, pick a show
Pick a hair, pick a coat, pick a car

Pick a fuck

Watch me go in

I could give it to you like this
Give it to you like that
Give it to you like this
Give it to you like that

They all know how I go
When they see me, they want more
What you see is what you get, though
We're hitting that smoke from the hydro

What you see is what you get, though
How we do it is same as the next pro
In a world where we put up where we get, though
How we do it is the same as the next roll

Pick a home, pick a lock, pick a door
Pick a club, pick a flow, pick a show
Pick a hood, pick a curb, pick a car

Watch me go in

I could give it to you like this
Give it to you like that
Give it to you like this
Give it to you like that

I got the key, I got the secret
