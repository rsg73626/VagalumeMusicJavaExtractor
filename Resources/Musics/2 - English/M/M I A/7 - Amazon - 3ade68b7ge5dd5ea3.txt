AMAZON

letra by Jalberti Campos

I was missin' in action
On the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun
From a street in Action x2

I was sipping on a Rubicon
Thinking 'bout where I come
Its all this for revolution
cuttin' up the coupon
Savin for a telephone
Can I call home
Please Can I go Home x2

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under home made lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon 
They're holding me Ransom x2

Hello This is M.I.A. 
Could you please Come get me x4

Smoking on a Benson
Tryin' to get me undone
Let Me Go
I don't want your attention
Under Submission
Out of frustration I'll do it
I'll scream for the nation x2

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under home made lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon 
They're holding me Ransom x2

Hello This is M.I.A. 
Could you please Come get me x4

Minutes turned to hours
And Became our dates
When We Shared raindrops
That turned into Lakes
Bodies started Merging
And the lines got grey 
Now I'm looking at him thinking
Maybe He's okay x2

Hello This is M.I.A
It's okay You forgot me x8
