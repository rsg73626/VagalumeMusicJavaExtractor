TROUBLE AGAIN

(trecho)
Ooh oh oh, I, you're in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble!
Ooh oh oh, I, you're in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble!
Ooh oh oh, I, you're in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble!
Ooh oh oh, I, you're in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble!
