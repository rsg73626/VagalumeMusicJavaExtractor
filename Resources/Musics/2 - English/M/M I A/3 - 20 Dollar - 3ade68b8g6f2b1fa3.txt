20 DOLLAR

War war war
Talkin' about y'alls such a bore
I'd rather talk about moi
Like do you know the cost of AK's up in Africa?
20 dollars ain't shit to you
But that's how much they are
So they're gonna use this shit just to get by

Is gold, diamonds helpin' ya?
Don't you like my bandana?
My stains hang low
On my shirts like a-ya-ya
Monkey brains and banana
I'll hit you with my antenna
I put soap in my eye
Make it red so I look raaa ra ra

So I woke up with my holy Qur'an and found out I like Allah-lah
So we shooting til the song is up
Little boys are acting up
Baby mamas are goin crazy
And the leaders all around cracking up
We goat rich, we fry
Price of living in a shanty town just seems very high
We still like T.I.
We still look fly
Dancing as we shooting up
And looting just to get by

With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head'll collapse when there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself:
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

War war war
Who made me like this?
Was it me and God in co-production?
My devil's on speed dial
Everytime I take the wrong direction
All I want is one thing and that is what you got
Sometimes I go lose my mind and then I feel numb

There's 24 hours in a day
I used to split it 8, 8, 8
8 work, 8 sleep, 8 for play
Now I give it all takes

People on the Internet
A new life for the intellect
People judge me so hard
Coz I don't floss my titty set
I was born out of dirt like I'm porn in a skirt
I was a little girl who made good with all that I blurt
I put people on the map that never seen a map
I show 'em something they ain't ever seen
And hope they make it back

With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head'll collapse when there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself:
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head'll collapse when there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself:
Where is my mind?
