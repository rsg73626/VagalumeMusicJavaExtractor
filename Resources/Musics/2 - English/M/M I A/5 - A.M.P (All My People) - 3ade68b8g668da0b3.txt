A.M.P (ALL MY PEOPLE)

It's M. I. A
(Yeah! Yeah! Hey!)

Don't bring me down there, don't bother me
You can't take me, you want me, pay me
You can't 2pac me, you can't Biggie me
I got a bikini with a balcony in Bequia
Don't wanna check me, gonna have to sack me
I keep on coming back, you freaking met me
I am proactive, run the prospective
Back on, I'm active, with matching red lipstick

Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this, but that's what you think

All my people say
All my people say

I'm not on seven, I'm on eleven
The difference is kind of like Devon and Yemen
When I get Oman, I say: Yeah, man
I'll open up a club and fill it strictly full of women
My momma go to church, she says: Amen
She also says why are men teaming up with demons
I love all men, they all take me to Heaven
I can't keep myself in church like a Mormon

Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this
But that's just what you think

All my people say
All my people say
