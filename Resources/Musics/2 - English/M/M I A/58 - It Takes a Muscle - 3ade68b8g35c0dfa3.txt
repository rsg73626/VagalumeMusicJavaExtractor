IT TAKES A MUSCLE

When everybody leaves you lonely, times are worse than sad
And the world is falling on your head
Just remember for all you know, good or bad come what may
You're gonna live tomorrow, if you don't die today.

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

Now the fear got in me, it's gotten me deep
It's where it's gonna stay, and never leave
Someone come lay my worry, someone come kill my pain
Someone come and put me on my feet again

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

We gotta love one another
That's what the good man says
But I got too much trouble going round my head
Someone come and pick up my love, take it all away
Feels like I'll break down tomorrow if i don't die today.

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
