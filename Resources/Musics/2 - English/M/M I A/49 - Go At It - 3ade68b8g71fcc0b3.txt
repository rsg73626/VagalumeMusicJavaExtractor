GO AT IT

Saw a dirty car and I washed it
I saw little bug and I squashed it
I see your little face and I brought it
And I [?] up on that club and I tore it
Yeah I've been it
Seen it
I am mega swagger and I called it
Ordered me some tacos and enjoyed it
Sang my song and I made it
Put in my Cd and I played it
Then it didn't played it and I tossed it
These rappers soundin' really jaded
All these artists soundin' so dated
Now I'm flossin makin money made it
The rent was overdue so I paid it
Police came my house and they raid it
Lookin' for some shit but I flushed it
