GEN-N-E-Y

You think you're bad
You think you're so fucking cool
Generation n e y we're already dead
If you don't give a fuck then I don't give a damn
But down with the scene that makes it so numb

I'm in the parking lot there's not a lot I've got
Some pig on a harley trying to sell me pot
I come and shut the doors their tinted glass door
Another stupid chore as I'm on the wet floor

You can have my money but you can't have me (x4)

Show me buy me to me ship me tell me wind me start with me
You can have my money but you can't have me
Here's my money give me shit I don't need
To me what you say I need is just so unnecessary

You can have my money but you can't have me (x4)

You think you're bad
You think you're so fucking cool
Generation n e y we're already dead
If you don't give a fuck then I don't give a damn
But down with the scene that makes it so numb
(x2)

Gas stop party shop any kind of cake shop
Gold shop cheese shop any kind of clothes shop
Alkie pop pizza pop any kind of pill shop
You could bring me anything but nothing's really gonna top
(x2)

You can have my money but you can't have me (x4)

Show me buy me to me ship me tell me wind me start with me
You can have my money but you can't have me
Here's my money give me shit I don't need
To me what you say I need is just so unnecessary

You can have my money but you can't have me (x8)
