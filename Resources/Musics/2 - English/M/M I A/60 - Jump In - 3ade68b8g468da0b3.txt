JUMP IN

Jump in, ju
Jump in, ju
Jump in, ju
Jump in, ju
Jump in, jump in

Zip up my jacket, put my phone in my pocket
Keep my mind open, and try not to lock it
I make up plans, make up, make up, make up plans
Put it in god's hands, and jump in to that van

Wake up, wake up your life and take up
Go thank that maker, get your life, and take off
Get your life, thank that maker and get your life
Get your life, thank that maker and get your life
You gotta keep that shit fine

When I see that border, I gon cross the line
When I see that border, I gon cross the line
When I see that dream, I go make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine

We go, we go
Take, take off
Go hit the sea
Hit the sea like Noah's ark, illegal

When I see that border, that border, that border
When I see that border, that border, that border
When I see that border, that border, that border
