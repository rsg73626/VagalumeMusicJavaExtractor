MANGO PICKLE DOWN RIVER

When it's hot we go down the river and swim
When we go fishing we're catching a brim
When the river's high we jump off the bridge
And then we go home and play some didge

When it's hot we go down the river and swim
When we go fishing we're catching a brim
When the river's high we jump off the bridge
And then we go home and play some didge

First of all I wanna say I don't even know why you act that way
My name is Maya and people always say
I act kinda strange like a dooba weh
I like fish and mango pickle
When I climb trees them feet them tickle
I'm broke this month, didn't pay rent
I had to jump town and my money’s all spent
I had to jump town and my money’s all spent

When it's hot we go down the river and swim
When we go fishing we're catching a brim
When the river's high we jump off the bridge
And then we go home and play some didge

When it's hot we go down the river and swim
When we go fishing we're catching a brim
When the river's high we jump off the bridge
And then we go home and play some didge

Rode the BMX, we walked through the bush
The boys fight to ride it but I just let them push
Keith stole an egg from a lil kookoo
Kept it safe in his mouth, while he danced the jookoo jookoo

There’s only one ocean that got fish left
One day we’ll have to be a really good chef
And I don’t mean us in the bush making meth
Boys, if you catch meth, you catch your death
When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick
Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits

When it's hot we go down the river and swim
When we go fishing we're catching a brim
When the river's high we jump off the bridge
And then we go home and play some didge

When it's hot we go down the river and swim
When we go fishing we're catching a brim
When the river's high we jump off the bridge
And then we go home and play some didge
