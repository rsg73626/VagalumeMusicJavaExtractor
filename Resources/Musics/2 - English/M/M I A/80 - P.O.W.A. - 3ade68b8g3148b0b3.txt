P.O.W.A.

[Hook]
Don't you wanna
Tell me if you're gonna
Put down your armour
Promise no more drama

Throw up my hands I say I'm not Dalai Lama
Throw up my hands say I'm not Obama

I'm not Osama
Monsanto farmer
I don't drink no soda
I believe in Karma
They try to shut me down
I've still got the power
They try to hate me
But I still be that lover

I know my mind
In me I'm gonna find
This is my time
And I'm searching for the signs
Throw up my hands
Say this is people power
Throw up my finger and I'm taking on the Tower

[Hook]
Don't you wanna
Tell me if you're gonna
Put down your armour
Promise no more drama

You know me I don't watch TV
People watching me are only gonna see
I'm not your enemy FBI checking me
Curbing my money but that don't bother me

I'm much tougher
I don't need the buffer
I keep it light
Keep my head out the gutter

I'ma do it now
I'ma do it
I'ma do it now
I'ma do it
I'ma do it now
I'ma show you how

Put your hands up
Put your middle fingers in the air
M. I. A. make it spray like it's raining up in here
Think you're getting baptised
With the sweat on your tree

Where where where
You say where my water there

You say wa wa wa wa wa
I say pa pa pa pa pa
You say wa wa wa wa wa
I say pa pa pa pa pa

Supa-kala fascist, racist, espi-ala-tazors
Posers with cases
They better not erase us
Batta come face us

I'm not Rihanna
I'm not Madonna
I'm not Mariah
Or Ariana
I've been around in this world causing drama
The real spice girl, hot girl power

[Hook]
Don't you wanna
Tell me if you're gonna
Put down your armour
Promise no more drama
Throw my hands
Say this is people power
Throw up my finger and I'm taking on the Tower
