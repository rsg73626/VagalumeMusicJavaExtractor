IT IZ WHAT IT IZ

I'm here to paint what's written on ya face
Cuz these are the days we are losing our ways
To find better ways to say what nobody says
We living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding

And it iz what it iz and this is how I'm feeling
We living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding
And it iz what it iz and this is how I'm feeling
Today eh eh eh eh

And it iz what it iz shorty
Today eh eh eh eh
And it iz what it iz shorty
I got affected but I affect a lot more
They all got issues but I got a bit more

I put it in boxes and I put it in a store
I hope you really like it I can do you some more
Yeah I'm gonna say something
Even if you think it's nothing
Cuz one day you are gonna say that

Today was bumping (x2)
Cuz we living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding
And it iz what it iz and this is how I'm feeling
We living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding
And it iz what it iz and this is how I'm feeling

Today eh eh eh eh
And it iz what it iz shorty
Today eh eh eh eh
And it iz what it iz shorty
Maybe it's just us or maybe it's just me

We can have discussions while we are playing Wii
(And it iz what it iz shorty, what it iz shorty,
today eh eh eh eh)
Maybe it's just us or maybe it's just me
We can have discussions while we are playing Wii

Yeah I'm gonna say something
Even if you think it's nothing
Cuz one day you are gonna say that
Today was bumping

Cuz we living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding
And it iz what it iz and this is how I'm feeling
We living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding
And it iz what it iz and this is how I'm feeling
