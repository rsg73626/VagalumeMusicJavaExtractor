BINGO

Letra by Jalberti Campos

Can you keep a secret 
From them other people 
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan? 
And would you let me know 
If I forget the secret 
Took my eye off of the Ball? 

Cause Bingo, now I'm hitting the 6 x4 

I know what's going on 
I know how you going on 
I got the ra ra 
Go ahead and throw the ball 
I don't be running at all 
I got my own goal 
I stand in one place 
and make sure I just hit the ball 

Can you keep a secret 
From them other people 
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan? 
And would you let me know 
If I forget the secret 
Took my eye off of the Ball? 

Cause Bingo, now I'm hitting the 6 x4 

You drink too much Rum 
You make me wanna run 
I make no assumption 
Ass will get the hump on 
Wha's the point of talkin' gun? 
I'm donel Blitz and bombed 
That what I don't run 
For the sake of havin' fun 

Can you keep a secret 
From them other people 
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan? 
And would you let me know 
If I forget the secret 
Took my eye off of the Ball? 

Cause Bingo, now I'm hitting the 6 x4 

Do you know what is on? 
Do you know what is on? 
Do you know how this beat is made in fucking London, Doc? x2 

Can you keep a secret 
From them other people 
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan? 
And would you let me know 
If I forget the secret 
Took my eye off of the Ball? 

Cause Bingo, now I'm hitting the 6 x4
