UNBREAK MY MIXTAPE

If you ever leave
Then I'll have to give up everything that I believe
Life is nothing but just a fantasy
Since he took away the love that's left in me
Please talk to me, did you ever fight for me?
And how come I stand by you
If I can't find my feet?
Now you can't stand me, make me your enemy
Now what did I do for you to call me crazy?
If you see a sudden change
Focus your mind away
Here's a mixtape that I made, let's take a break
Don't wanna fuss away, baby if it's too late
While I get my life sorted, here's a mixtape

It's me but it's not where you have been
Fore you fall away from all
So far away for me

When you hit your face, throw me up like mace
Yeah, what's it for?
We're just another case
Hurt does leave a trace
Love's the darkest phase
And this hole is deeper than therefore the eye embrace

Did you fight for me? Did you cry for me?
And how come I stand by you
If I can't find my feet?
If you see a sudden change
Focus your mind away
Here's a mixtape that I made, let's take a break
Don't wanna fuss away, baby if it's too late
While I get my life so it is a mixtape

Oh my baby, oh my baby
Oh why? Oh my
Oh my baby, oh my baby
Oh why? Oh my

Did you fight for me? Did you cry for me?
And how come I stand by you
If I can't find my feet?
If you see a sudden change
Focus your mind away
Here's a mixtape that I made, let's take a break
Don't wanna fuss away, baby if it's too late
While I get my life so it is a mixtape

Please, let me sit down beside you
I've got something to tell you, darling
You wanna know
I just can't wait, no not another day
I love you more than words can say
