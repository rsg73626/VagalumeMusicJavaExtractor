YOU MY LOVE (FEAT. ROSALY)

We squeeze
We sniff
We cut away
(M-M-M. I. A.)
The ultimate

(You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you)

Got a bunch of stress
Bitches call me no less
I stay grounded in the age of unrest

I been billin'
While I'm chillin'
Must confess
It's just important that I get this off my chest

(You-you-you-you)
You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

Every time I see you
I'm on the rebound
Rewind the words
And I'm still (re-found?)
Every time I hit refresh, reboot, reload
I need to refill, rebuild, react

(You-you-you-you)
You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

A hustler is a female version of a hustler!
So come here little soldier
I'll get you there faster. [?]
I'm a dasher but I'll leave you hangin' in a Chrysler
I'm the bitch that got you talking
Here's the fucking mantra

(You my love)
You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

You my love, you my love
You my, you my love
You my love

This is my vent
I scream it down my celly
When you start makin' me peanut butter jelly
It may be wrong, but it's just sometimes scary
Every time I scream it out
You don't seem to hear me

(You my love)
