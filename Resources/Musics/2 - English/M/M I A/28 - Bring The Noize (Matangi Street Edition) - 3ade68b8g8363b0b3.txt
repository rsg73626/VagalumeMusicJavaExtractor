Im so tangy, people call me mathangi
Goddess of word, bitches Imma keep it banging
Truth is like a rotten tooth
You gotta spit it out!
Let the bottom two
Let my wisdom work it out
Big on the underground, cant knock me down
Vicki leekx bitches, back by dope demand
I sleep on my talent and I stand by it too
I can say lots with a little words
Or few like
Like adam had 'em, yeh, me, the madame
Yeah Ill introduce you to the dooms do dooms
Come let we go, do you like my perfumes?
Made it at home with some gasoline
And shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes
We like fucking carpets, you fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs
They're downloading on bing
My cousin got his g. c. s. e. 's decorating
Hes handy you might need him
When I finish what Im saying
Let's be frank, you my stan, I'm your stan
I dont care what you smoke
What you fucking drank
I'm allowed to be pissed
At mates who are yanks
Cause its not me and you
It's the fucking banks!

Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!

Truth is like a rotten tooth
You gotta spit it out
I left the bottom two
Let my wisdom work it out
The world is ours, send your soldier powers
These words I announce
Hope you heard 'em like cows
Alpha kenny buddy, roger, charlie, and rich
Bitch, my swag bitches
But you cant touch this
So click, click, click
Please get off my dick
Just cause I know more dont make me thick
I'm a overweight, heavyweight
Female slick rick
If you need the trees
Then my shits got stick
I got bug spray, bucket, stick
Tons of the fun stuff, tons and tons of it

Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
