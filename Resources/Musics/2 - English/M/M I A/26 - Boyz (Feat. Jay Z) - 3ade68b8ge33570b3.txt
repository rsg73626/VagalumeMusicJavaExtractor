[Verse 1: M. I. A.]
How many tequilas in the place
How many beers are in the case?
Boys there, how many? Boys there, how many?
How many Dutty Wine swing it away
How many shots without a chase?
Boys there, how many? Boys there, how many?
How many mash up and in a haze
How many rocket that fall on the head
Boys there, how many? Boys there, how many?
How many no money boys are crazy
How many boys are raw
How many no money boys are rowdy
How many start a war
How many no money boys are crazy

[M. I. A.]
How many people say nothing when idiot says it all
How many people get frustrated waiting for Bush to fall

[Jay-Z]
How many soldiers are ready to fight
How many ready for war
How many niggas get locked up for drugs
The government swinging at all

[M. I. A.]
How many billions dead it takes before the troops are home
How many fans? no what you did is wrong

[Jay-Z]
Gotta get Bush out the chair, give Obama the floor
Let's bring back Reagan, at least he was getting that raw
These politicians don't give a shit, the hood's still getting ignored
Gotta get paid now, for all the of the days before it got sprayed
Can you put dogs away, can I get paid now
how much we continue to move the white
Triple the A or the B like math
Halo like bikes, just to wheelie through life
American Dream don't last through the night
American Pie, can I get a slice?
American Dream don't last through the night
American Pie, can I get a slice?
Soldiers... Stomp! Soldiers... Stomp!
Soldiers... Stomp! Soldiers... Stomp!
