FREEDUN (FEAT. ZAYN)

I'm a swagger man
Rolling in my swagger van
From the People's Republic Of Swagistan
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
I'm M. I. A., ay

I don't need any audition
I just got my own little mission
A crew bigger than a politician
Yeah, history is just a competition
Do you wanna sign my petition?
It's for the people with dedication
Some people fuck it up, technications
Refugee learns about patience
Sometimes I have many visions
I don't even need a religion
I'm a new frontier, horizons
Yeah, I sell this shit to the thousands
Even aliens see the presentation
Yeah, tune up the dial on the station
And think of me sort of like Tarzan
And I'm swinging this beat, salvation

[Zayn]
All the stars are still shining
But you're the only one I see
I can feel when your heart beats, yeah
But you can't keep your eyes off me

Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom

Download it on the DVD, download it on the phone
If you don't catch them, then baby I'm gone
Send me your money, and I will send you my song
What you get is perfect to turn me life-long
Lara Croft is soft when it comes my stuff
She's made up, I'm real, that's enough
Dinosaurs died and I'm still strong
A little bit of fun, yeah, I don't see the wrong
This song is so good, yeah I waited too long
I rape that button just to play this song
Whose world is this?
The world is mine so bring it on

[Zayn]
All the stars are still shining
But you're the only one I see
I can feel when your heart beats, yeah
But you can't keep your eyes off me

Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom
Free-de-de-dum, free-dom

I am singing my song
You're gonna sing my song tonight
Tonight you're gonna sing my song
Are you gonna sing my song tonight?

You're gonna sing my song oh
