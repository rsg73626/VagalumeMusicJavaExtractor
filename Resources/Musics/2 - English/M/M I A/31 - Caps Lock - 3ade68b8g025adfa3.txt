CAPS LOCK

Caps locks are still on when I log off to sleep
My baby stays awake for every dream i try to keep
No matter what they say, I'll carry on thinking this way
I oversee my life and whats happened to me

Liquid washed down my throat like soap, yeah
I don't wanna think about the shit that's warped
But I don't wanna be deep on this beat
And I can't fucking let go of whats around me

Yeah, my left side is my right side
If its vice versa i'm still the same side
Stay until it gets better
I never trust a letter
When it don't write, don't matter

I just got a knew one
I don't wanna get lost on your screen
except when its hit by big sunbeam
I want you to know my thought stream
That's why I'm always trying to stay in my dream
