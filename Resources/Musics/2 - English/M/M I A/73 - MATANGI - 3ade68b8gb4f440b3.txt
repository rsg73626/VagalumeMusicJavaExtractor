[Bridge]
Pretty raw
Get to the floor
Came up listening to war war
Weekend breaks in Singapore
Preach like a priest
I sing like a whore
Do you want more?
Do you want more?
Do you know what I got in store?
Do you want more?
Do you want more?
It's so simple get to the floor

[Hook]

It's so simple get to the floor
Do you want more?
Do you want more?
Do you know what I got in store?

[Verse 2]
I'm ice cream
And you're sorbet
They got guns but it points the wrong way
Yeah I'm on it they cirque de soleil
They make big sounds with nothing to say
School of fakeness
I'm school of hard knocks
You're here to fool us
I'm here to take shots
Look-alike, copycat
Doppelg√§nger, fraud
They ain't got nothing on me
Now I'm getting bored
If you're gonna be me you need a manifesto
If you ain't got one you better get one presto
Yeah you got money we sell bootlegs only
When the shit counts our numbers way plenty
We started at the bottom but Drake gets all the credit
Paper route or life route yeah we be ready

[Hook]
