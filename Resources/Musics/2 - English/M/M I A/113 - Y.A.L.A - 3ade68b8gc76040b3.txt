Y.A.L.A

YALA, YALA

Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo, a banana pole
Like you're goin up a yoyo

Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo, a banana pole
Like you're goin up a yoyo

Yeah, yeah, YALA
Yeah, yeah, YALA

So the dance go off when I enter the building

YALA, YALA, YALA, YALA

I drink some Cointreau
Keep it in my poncho
Run out like Castro
Blow up and get go

Pullin' a cinco
Great like Canaveral
They love when I'll go
Hard like I'm death row

Weighing kilo
Lies a pillow
Don't tell my tic-toe
Look how them buns go

Come come come
When we comin' some some
Yeah a glass around
Yeah I got me some pom pom
For fun for fun
Yea it's getting undone
We've been here, we move on
It's been so long since we hung

Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo, a banana pole
Like you're goin up a yoyo

Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo, a banana pole
Like you're goin up a yoyo

YALA, YALA

Empty wowo
And I am understood
I get the lolo
Searching for me unfold

Bankin offshore
Got a trip to Singapore
And it could end like
I'm doin' the animal

For the oracle
Don't run the igno
That's why I say shit
So they can explore

My baby, I am more
My mommy I adore
I take you stay and play
Can't take it anymore

Come come come
When we comin' some some
Yea a glass around
Yea I got me some pom pom
For fun for fun
Yea it's getting undone
We've been here, we move on
It's been so long since we hung

Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo, a banana pole
Like you're goin up a yoyo

Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo, a banana pole
Like you're goin up a yoyo

Yeah yeah, yo-yo
Yeah yeah, yo-yo
So the dance go off when I enter the building

YALA, YALA, YALA

YALA, YALA
I'm really so YALA
You can take a photo
I'mma keep it wowo

YALA, YALA
I'm really so YALA
You can take a photo
I'mma keep it wowo

YALA, YALA

Come come come
When we comin' some some
Yeah a glass around
Yea I got me some pom pom
For fun for fun
Yea it's getting undone
We've been here, we move on
It's been so long since we hung

*YOLO?
I don't even know anymore
What that even mean though
If you only live once
Why we keep doing the same shit?
Back home where I come from
We keep being born again and again
And then again and again
That's why they invented karma
