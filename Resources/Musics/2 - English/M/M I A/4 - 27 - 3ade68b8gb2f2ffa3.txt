27

Said you're "all mouth and no brains"
All rock stars go to heaven
You said you'll be dead at 27
When we drunk in a english tavern
The owner poured you the Bourbon
And you drunk yourself so rotten
He got so rich he bought a Bentley
And moved himself to Devon

You started dirty dancing
And you bar tended a dozen
I took you to the clinic
To get you clean but you couldn't
Said in two days you're 27
And your destiny was coming
So your papa passed so sudden
And left you with lil' somin'

You blew that money on a mountain of drugs
And staged yourself a bed in
A month later when I popped in
You're still high but the winter set in
I bought you a coffee and a muffin
And you quoted me some Lenin
I wished I was that clever
But that's what kept me coming
Your friendship did mean somin'
But you left me for nothing
When I left, you befriended a rope
And I saw you both were hanging
