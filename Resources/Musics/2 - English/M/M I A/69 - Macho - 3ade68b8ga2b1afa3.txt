MACHO

I mashed up a a coconut outside by the back wall
shoot a pro for eating up my mango
Daddy was home, huntin' up the rubble
Get your mama, quick get the polo (?!)
We had no idea we were cookin' for commando
Everybody coming forward with a truckload
Big head with players on the down low
like a coffee and filled with the info (?)

And now that we really rock now, we're macho
and that's what we wanted all along
And that's right, that's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

I can't have videos made by Sony, yo
Spring films of Rocky and Rambo
Roll model from bollywood to jungle
We learned about using from our heroes
Aviator shades, no winds with the grenade
Kicking out in camouflage and band-aid
Homemade tin records that ricochet
When it's hot, we all make lemonade

And now that we really rock now, we're macho
and that's what we wanted all along
And that's right, that's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

Picked out a name and got my new uniform,
girl gladiator, step in the stadium
One next to chick now, talkin' rebellion
cyanide pill hangin' like medallion
Picked out a name and got my new uniform,
girl gladiator, step in the stadium
One next to chick now, talkin' rebellion
cynide pill hangin' like medallion

And now that we, we rock now, we're macho
and that's what we wanted all along
And that's right, that's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

And now that we, we rock now, we're macho
and that's what we wanted all along
And that's right, that's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple
