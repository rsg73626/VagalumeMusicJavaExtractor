GET AROUND

Bitch!
You can't tame me to talk
Cuz I don't wanna talk shit all day
Bitch!
(Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh)
Listen!

Step One don't Step Back
I step up but I don't step over
I can go around
I can go raw
I could go far
For you I go forward
I can go late
I can swag up
I can go lonely even though I don't look back
Copper always see me
Copper always say
Riches really hard
when I do my thang

Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Ohh Woah Woah [x2]

Coppers always say
riches really hard when you do my way

[?]
The pack can get around
go pack when I get home
Next time I see you
line a patch up in my phone
Interneters say I dress for so fly
International bitches like my names
they swell that
A-R-U-L-P-R-A-G-A-S-A-M All day

Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Ohh Woah Woah [x2]

If they want to rock it this way
Then they want to rock it that way
I say "yeah"
I'm gonna be standin here
I am steady
You can't rock me
If they want to rock it this way
Then they want to rock it that way
I say "yeah"
I'm gonna be standin here
I am steady
You can't rock me

Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Get around (Bitches get around)
Ohh Woah Woah [x2]

If it's not the world
It's the people
If it's not the people
Then maybe it's you
If it's not you
then maybe it's me
If it's not me
It's the Music
Many people you know
might act like doubters
That's why we do this
That's why we do that
