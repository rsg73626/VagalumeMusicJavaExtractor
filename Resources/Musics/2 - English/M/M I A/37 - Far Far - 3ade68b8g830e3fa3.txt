FAR FAR

Time got me feeling emotions
Why you always digging on my nerve?
I feel weak, when I say "please" you keep on
Does breaking me make you feel so strong?

I go give, show you how low I go
Playa boy go 'head and be that macho
Power up that blade on that chainsaw
Go cut me down and I'm still gon grow

Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

Coz yesterday I met a girl from Warsaw
She walked like a turtle with a saw paw
Why don't they make some kinda new law
That stops making a religioon out of war?
Yeah, happy you know lots of useless info
Keep ticking like a brain on a robot
But I do know some things you don't know
That people you hate come back for more

Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

A tug of war with me and he was called for
Like he was iced tea, I was always pom more
But you broke me when you act like you want war
Coz my strength makes you feel insecure

Now here we go, we bouncing like a pinball
I let him go so he can go paint time gold
Why don't we live for that love though?
Or does money still drive you a whole lot more?
