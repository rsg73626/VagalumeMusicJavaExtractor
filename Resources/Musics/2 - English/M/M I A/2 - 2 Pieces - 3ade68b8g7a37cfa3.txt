2 PIECES

I'm searching for someone just like you, like you
You can't stop thinking about me and you,
I've needed this so much, so much
So why stop this feeling from going on

Its all so funny, but its no fun
Is this my happy end, or have we just begun
Do we know that we break into two pieces
Keep on saying: "My heart is still yours, still yours"
When we see that we're cracking in two pieces
While ours hearts spin around so free, so free

I give my best not to miss you, miss you
While you try not to kiss
I want to be with you, with you
So why stop this feeling from growing strong

Cause we know that we're broken into pieces
Keep on saying: "My heart is still yours, still yours"
But it's true that we're broken in two pieces
While ours hearts spin around so free, so free

I want to wake up, wake up
I want to wake up, wake up

Cause we know that we're broken into pieces
Keep on saying: "My heart is still yours, still yours"
But it's true that we're broken in two pieces
While ours hearts spin around so free, so free
