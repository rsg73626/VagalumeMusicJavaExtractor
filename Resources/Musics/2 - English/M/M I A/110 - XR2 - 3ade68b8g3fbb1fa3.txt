XR2

Where were you in '92?
Where were you in '92?
Where were you in '92?

This is how we do in the XR2
The boyz look fine, stereos alpine
20/20, thunderbird at 12-0-9
Took a pill, good time all the time

Brick lane massive
We were like grime
Labyrinth, world dance
Bagley's time
High-top fades
We ain't never paid
Roll up jeans, E's, Lucozade
Versace jeans, shades and chains
We bol in there like we late
DJ, MC's, private raves
Keep it secret, light it, mate

Whistle whistle blow blow
Here we here we go go
(repeat)

Some of them drink Heineken
And some of them drink Bacardi
Some of them talk a lot of shit
And act rowdy
Some say people follow me
Some say people is the key
When the music's got a beat
Then that's what gets me
Some say...
Some say...
When the music's got a beat
Then that's what gets me
Some people think we are stupid
But we are not

Whistle whistle blow blow
