CAN SEE CAN DO

Checking my headphone staying until dawn
Doesn't make a difference if they all become the same form
Looking back at history, yeah all the things that it's changed
Some things are just do, and some things are just don't

Can see, can do, can see can do, can you?
Can we get past history, wanna make a future with you

Can see, can do, can see can do, can you?
Can we get past history, wanna make a future with you

There's only a few things that I really really get
Yeah you know, I'm sure about that
There's only a few things that can knock me off my track
Yeah of course I'm sure about that
There's only a few things that I really really get
Yeah you know, I'm sure about that
There's only a few things that can knock me off my track
Yeah of course I'm sure about that
I keep it going like it's never enough
Chasing the mountains and the things above
Some people see planes, some people see drones
Some people see a do, some people see don't

Can see, can do, can see can do, can you?
Can we get past history, wanna make a future with you

I keep my shoulders up, my head all wrapped up
Second stances makes my mind fucked up
I keep it cool when things are hot and tough
I stay on it like they can't catch up

Can see, can do, can see can do, can you?
Can we get past history, wanna make a future with you

(Na na na nana nanana) (x4)

[?], got two words
One can? t see two, can? t see, stay in the [?]
Wanna get poor [?] at the VS
P. S., do you wanna drink beers
[?]
Wanna get, side to side, jerk a dick on my shoelace

Can see, can do, can see can do, can you?
Can we get past history, wanna make a future with you
