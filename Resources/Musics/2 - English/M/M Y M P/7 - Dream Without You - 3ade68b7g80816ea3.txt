DREAM WITHOUT YOU

Verse 1:
Last night, you said you love me
Last night, you said you needed me
When I woke up, I never saw your face
When I woke up, you never left a trace
And if there's nothing I can say or do
I'll sing this song, I wanna sing to you

Chorus:
I don't wanna dream if my dream is without you
I don't wanna sleep if my dream will only be blue
I don't wanna hear the words, I don't wanna feel your touch
All I know is that you hurt me so much

Verse 2: 
You said that we would stay together
I thought that we would be forever
I never thought we'd ever part
But now I have a broken heart
I wonder why I never understand
But I understood when I saw you then

[Repeat CHORUS]

It's been years since we part
And all those years I never had a change of heart
I'm not asking you back, I just need a friend
All I'm asking is, let me dream again 


And if there's nothing I can say or do
I'll sing this song, I wanna sing to you

[Repeat CHORUS]

I don't wanna dream if my dream is without you
I don't wanna sleep if my dream will only be blue

[Repeat CHORUS]
