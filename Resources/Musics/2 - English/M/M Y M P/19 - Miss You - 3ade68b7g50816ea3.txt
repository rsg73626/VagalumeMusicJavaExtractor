MISS YOU

Verse 1:
Everyday and every night
This feeling I fight, try as I might
But I won't win, I surrender, I'd die
You are winning here alright
Every morning when the sun would shine on me
I'd flash a smile but deep inside I feel so sad and lonely
I need you here and now

Chorus:

I miss you
It's crazy to pretend that I don't think of you
The more this feeling just seems to grow and grow
I miss you (I miss you)
Oh how much longer can I hold on to
Maybe you can come and tell me that you miss me too


Miss you... 
Miss you...
Aaaahhhh…….

Verse 2: 
All I want is for this love to last forever
You walked away, never came back, oh, I tried to recover
I can't bear it, boy, alright
When I hear a song that we had used to share
I'll try as might to hide the tears,
and when the pain is over
I'll wish that you are near
