GET ME

(Words & Music by Raymund Ryan/Published 
by Soundscape Music Publishing)



You know that you are always in my mind 
In my heart, in my soul 
And everywhere that I can think of

You know that I will always be just fine 
I’m okay, I’m alright, I am super 
And everything that I can think of 

But not really, and I am sorry 
‘Cause you’re not here, lying next to me 


So c’mon and get me, get me, get me 
Baby I’m yours, c’mon and get me 
You’ll never be lonely, lonely, lonely 
So baby c’mon and get me 


You know that I have always dream of you 
Only you, in the day, in the night 
Every waking hour of my life
