I'LL NEVER GET OVER YOU GETTING OVER ME

I hear your taking the town again
Having a good time 
With all your good time time friends
I don't think that you think of me
Your on your own now 
And i'm alone and free

I know that i should get on with my life
But a life live without you could never be right

As long as the star shine down from the heaven
As long as the river run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me

I tried to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody i was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away
Loneliness found me looks like its here to stay

I know that i ought to find someone new
But all i found is my self always thinking of you

As long as the star shine down from the heaven
As long as the river run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me

Oh no matter what i do
Each nights a life time to live through 
I can't go on like this 
I need your touch 
Your the only one i ever loved

And as long as the star shine down from the heaven
As long as the river run to the sea
I'll never get over you,getting over,
I'll never get over you,
I'll never get over you getting over me...
