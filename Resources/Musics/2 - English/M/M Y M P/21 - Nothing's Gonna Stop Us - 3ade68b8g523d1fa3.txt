NOTHING'S GONNA STOP US

Looking in your eyes, i see a paradise
This world that i found is too good to be true
Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you this love in my heart
That i'm feeling for you.

Let them say we're crazy
Don't care about that  
Baby round in my in my hand, baby, don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we`re heart to heart

And we can build this dream together,
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us, 
nothing's gonna stop us now ooh ohh

I'm so glad i found you,
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes to i will stay here with you
Take it to the good times,
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what i'm gonna do

Let them say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we`re heart to heart

And we can build this dream together,
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us..

Oohh. all that i need is you 
All that i ever need.
And all that i want to do is hold you forever, forever and ever..

And we can build this dream together,
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us........
oohh wooohh 
Nothing's gonna stop us...now
Hey baby...

And we can build this dream together,
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothings gonna stop us
Nothings gonna stop us now...
