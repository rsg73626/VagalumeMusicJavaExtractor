ESPECIALLY FOR YOU

Especially for you 
I wanna let you know what I was 
Going through 
All the time we were apart I thought 
Of you 
You were in my heart 
My love never changed 
I still feel the same 

Especially for you 
I wanna tell you I was feeling that 
Way too 
And if dreams were wings, you 
Know 
I would have flown to you 
To be where you are 
No matter how far 
And now that I’m next to you 

No more dreaming about 
Tomorrow 
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow 
I’ve got to say 
It’s all because of you 

And now were back together, 
Together 
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true 
And all the love I have is 
Especially for you 

Especially for you 
I wanna tell you, you mean all the world to me 
How I’m certain that our love was 
Meant to be 
You changed my life 
You showed me the way 
And now I’m next to you 

I’ve waited long enough to find you 
I wanna put all the hurt behind you 
And I wanna bring out all the love 
Inside you, oh and 
Now were back together, together 
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true 
And all the love I have is 
Especially for you 

You were in my heart 
My love never changed 
And now that I’m next to you 
No more dreaming about 
Tomorrow 
Forget the loneliness and the 
Sorrow 
I’ve got to say 
It’s all because of you 

And Now were back together, together 
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true 
And all the love I have is 
Especially for you 

Together, together 
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true 
And all the love I have is 
Especially for you
