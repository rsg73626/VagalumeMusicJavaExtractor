JAM (SET YOUR SPIRITS FREE)

(Words and Music by Chin Alcantara/Published by
Soundscape Music Publishing)



When I wake up in the morning
The first thing I do before I eat my bacon
Pick up my guitar and turn the volume up

Following my dreams
Set your spirits free

Jam we can make believe
Sing along and play along whatever you please
Jam set your spirits free

Cruisin’ in my car or driving in traffic
I’m listening to Southborder
I am a fanatic
When I’m in the office I turn the radio on

After the dinner, before I go to sleep
I wash my face and of course I brush my teeth
Turn the lights off and turn my radio on

And follow your dreams
