CLOSER I GET TO YOU

The closer I get to you, the more you make me see
By giving me all you got Your love has
captured
me.

Over and Over again, I've tried to tell myself that we
could
never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lying here in your arms, time just seems to fly
I'm needing you more and more 
Let's give love a try 

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those(Heaven's there for those)
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love
In a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me what you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and Over again
I've tried to tell myself that we(tell myself that we)
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew this was real
The way you make me feel

Closer I get to you (closer I get to you) 
Feeling comes over me (feeling comes over me) 
We’re going closer and sweeter as gravity 
The closer I get to you…
