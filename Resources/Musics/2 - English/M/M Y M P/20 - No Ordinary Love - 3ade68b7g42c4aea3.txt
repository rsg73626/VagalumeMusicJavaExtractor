NO ORDINARY LOVE

This could have been just another day 
But instead we're standing here 
No need for words it's all been said 
In the way you hold me near 
I was alone on this journey 
You came along to comfort me 
Everything I want in life is right here 
'Cause 

Chorus: 
This is not your ordinary 
No ordinary love 
I was not prepared enough 
To fall so deep in love 
This is not your ordinary 
No ordinary love 
You were the first to touch my heart 
And everything right again with your extraordinary love 

I get so weak when you look at me 
I get lost inside your eyes 
Sometimes the magic is hard to believe 
But you're here before my very eyes 
You brought joy to my world 
Set me so free 
I want you to understand 
You're every breath that I breathe 

Chorus

From the very first time that we kissed 
I knew that I just couldn't let you go at all 
From this day on, remember this: 
That you're the only one that I adore 
Can we make this last forever 
This can't be a dream
'Cause it feels so good to me 

Chorus x2
