WHEN I DREAM

I could build a mansion 
That is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want 
And never ask please

I could fly to Paris 
It's at my beck and calls
Why do I live my life alone 
With nothing at all

(But) when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
When I dream, I dream of you 
Maybe someday you will come true

I can be the singer 
Or the clown in any room
I can call up someone 
To take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on 
And drive the man insane
I can go to bed alone 
And never know his name
