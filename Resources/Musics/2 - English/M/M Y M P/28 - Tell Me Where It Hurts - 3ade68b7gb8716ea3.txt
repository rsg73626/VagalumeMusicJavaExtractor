TELL ME WHERE IT HURTS

Why is that sad look in your eyes 
Why are you crying 
Tell me now, tell me now 
Tell me, why you're feelin' this way 
I hate to see you so down, oh baby 
Is it your heart 
Oh, that's breakin' all in pieces 
Makin' you cry 
Makin' you feel blue 
Is there anything that I can do 

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby 
And I'll do my best to make it better 
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away 
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me 
And I love you with a love so tender 
Oh and if you let me stay 
I'll love all of the hurt away 

Where are all those tears coming from 
Why are they falling 
Somebody, somebody, somebody left your heart in the cold 
You just need somebody to hold on, baby 
Give me a chance to put back all the pieces 
Take your broken heart 
Make it just like new 
There's so many things that I can do 

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby 
And I'll do my best to make it better 
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away 
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me 
And I love you with a love so tender 
Oh and if you let me stay 
I'll love all of the hurt away 

(Instrumental) 

Oh I'm gonna take it all away, baby 

Is it your heart 
Oh, that's breakin' all in pieces 
Makin' you cry 
Makin' you feel blue 
Is there anything that I can do 

Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby 
And I'll do my best to make it better 
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away 
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me 
And I love you with a love so tender 
Oh and if you let me stay 
I'll love all of the hurt away 

Tell me, baby 
Tell me, oh yea 
Is there anything I can do, baby 
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me 
And I love you with a love so tender 
Oh and if you let me stay 
I'll love all of the hurt away
