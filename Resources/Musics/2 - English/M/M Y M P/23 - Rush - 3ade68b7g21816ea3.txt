RUSH

(Words and Music by Juris Fernandez/Published

I look up and say my prayer
At times I feel there’s no one there
Though I ask for a shoulder that I could lean on
What’s deep in my heart?
He knows what I’m looking for

And then that’s when I met you
Faith could have brought me to you
I know you’re my answered prayer
‘Cause I see in you

Eyes that could see through me
Warmth that takes away my plea
Where my heart is felt as it changes beat
I know when/that is time we allow love to take its seat

At dawn when there’s no one to talk to
I’m lost for words and darkness makes me blue
And I ask for a shoulder that I could lean on
What’s deep in my heart?
He knows that I’m longing for
