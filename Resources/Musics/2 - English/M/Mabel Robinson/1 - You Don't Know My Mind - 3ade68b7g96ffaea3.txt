YOU DON'T KNOW MY MIND

I went to the racetrack my man he won
He gave his other woman money and didn't give me none
You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

He said he didn't want me, i wasn't good enough
I'm gonna get myself another man and call his bluff
You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I'm not good lookin', i don't dress fine
But i'm the kind of mama that will take my time
You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know my mind
You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

Aw you don't know, you don't know, you don't know my mind
You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'
