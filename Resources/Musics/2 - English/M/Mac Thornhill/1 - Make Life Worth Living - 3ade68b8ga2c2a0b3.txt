MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING

Living life may not always be easy, no baby
What you think is right may turn all gone
Were so very wrong
People stop and look at you like you'd look crazy, oh baby
All you've got to do is just stand strong
And do the things that you like to do
and let yourself be free

Make life worth living
Just make life worth living
Make life worth living
Just make life worth living

Living everything Oh not the only way
Make life worth living
They know you have to do if you want to make true
Just make life worth living
Living everything Oh not the only way

You've got to find someone who you believe in 
Someone who believes in you, baby you said you'd do
The love you give can be there Be with worthy in
This not for sure in that that love is true, oh

Is good to have someone to own To let love take control

Making love life...      Coming Brown!

Living life may not always be easy, no baby
What you think is right may turn all gone
Were so very wrong
People stop and look at you like you'd look crazy, oh baby
All you've got to do is just stand strong
And do the things that you like to do
and let yourself be free

Make life worth living
Just make life worth living

Living everything Oh not the only way
Make life worth living
They know you have to do if you want to make true
Just make life worth living
Living everything Oh not the only way
