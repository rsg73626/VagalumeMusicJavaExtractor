FIRST STEPS

For so long I was living my life
Very secure in my conviction
I was sure no one would see inside
As long as I held to my perfection
But a voice within kept telling me it's something was wrong
That the truth I knew was merely contemplation
I tried to ignore that peaceful inner song
But my hand would not stop shaking

Watch the baby learning to walk
All it can do is stand
Wanting so much to be like them
Content to hold their hand
Watch the baby learning to talk
Able to mumble sounds
Trying so hard to be like them
Until he falls back down

Looking back, all those years of frustration
Better let them go or I'll fall again
Holding on to what's left of my faith
One day I'll find the perfect match
Then a voice within reminds me how it really used to be
In spite of myself I made the transformation
But I remain a stubborn child
Searching desperately for a hand to place my faith in

Watch the baby learning to walk
All it can do is stand
Wanting so much to be like them
Content to hold their hand
See the baby learning to talk
Able to mumble sounds
Trying so hard to be like them
Until he trips and falls back down
