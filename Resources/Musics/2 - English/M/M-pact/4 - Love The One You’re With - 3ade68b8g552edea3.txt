LOVE THE ONE YOU’RE WITH

There’s a rose 
In a fisted glove 
And the eagle flies, 
Flies with the dove 
So if you can’t be with the one you love, 
Love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 

If you’re down 
And you’re confused 
And you don’t remember who you’re talking to 
Your concentration has swept away 
Because your baby is so far away 

There’s a rose 
In a fisted glove 
And the eagle flies, 
Flies with the dove 
And if you can’t be with the one you love, 
Then love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 

Don’t be angry 
And don’t be sad 
Just keep smiling 
And thinking about all the good times that you had 
‘Cause there’s somebody right next to you 
And they’re just waiting for something to do 

There’s a rose 
In a fisted glove 
And the eagle flies, 
Flies with the dove 
And if you can’t be with the one you love, 
Then love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 

There’s a rose 
In a fisted glove 
And the eagle flies, 
Flies with the dove 
And if you can’t be with the one you love, 
Then, love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 

Well turn your heartache right into joy 
‘Cause you’re a girl 
And hey, I’m a boy 
Let’s get together 
And recognize that sooner or later 
We ain’t gonna need no more vibes 

There’s a rose 
In a fisted glove 
And the eagle flies, 
Flies with the dove 
And if you can’t be with the one you love, 
Then, love the one you’re with (I’ve got to fly like an eagle) 
Love the one you’re with (till I’m free) 
Love the one you’re with (fly like an eagle let my spirit carry me) 

There’s a rose 
In a fisted glove 
And the eagle flies, 
Flies with the dove 
And if you can’t be with the one you love, 
Then, love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with 
Love the one you’re with
