29 WAYS

I’ve got 29 ways to make it to my baby’s door
I’ve got 29 ways to make it to my baby’s door
If she needs me bad
I’ll find about two or three more

I’ve got one through the basement
Two down the hall
When they go and get a rug i need a hole in the wall
29 ways just to make it to my baby’s door
If she needs me bad
I’ll find about two or three more

I can come through the chimney like santa claus,
Go through the window and that ain’t all,
I’ve got a lot of ways i don’t want you to know,
I’ve even got a hole in the bedroom floor

I’ve got 29 ways to make it to my baby’s door
If she needs me bad
I’ll find about two or three more
‘cause i’ve got 29 ways
To make it to my baby’s door
If she needs me bad
I’ll find about two or three more

I’ve got a way through the closet behind all the clothes,
A way through the attic that nobody knows,
A master key that fits any lock,
A hidden door by the grandfather clock

I’ve got 29 ways to make it to my baby’s door
If she needs me bad
I’ll find about two or three more
I’ve got 29 ways
Gotta find about two or three more
If she needs me bad,
I’ll find about two or three more
Gotta find about two or three more
