A DREAM COME TRUE

Hand in hand, and up to the skies
Over the rainbow we will fly away
Forever and ever I will be with you, you
We can make a dream come true, true
That's just made for me and you, you
We can make a dream come true, true
Heaven must be me and you
We can make a dream come true, wo-hoho

I've got you under my skin
I know the harder begin
To tell you what's on my mind
Baby you blow my mind
