WITHOUT YOUR LOVE

Off and on
So many times
The good and the bad
Kept changing my mind
Black or white,
Which would it be?
I was stranded and we wanted everything

So how could I choose
Without being told?
I can't spend my youth
Being all alone and growing old
Choosing again can be such a task
But when will I try and how will I ask?

I made the choice
To live life without your love
The time has gone by
And still it's you I'm thinking of
To be without you
Makes me regret each day
I chose to live this way

I was cool or so I thought
You're playing my mind and I think a lot
Heaven or hell, bells still ring
But I just want you back you are everything

I made the choice
To live life without your love
The time has gone by
And still it's you I'm thinking of
To be without you
Makes me regret each day
I chose to live this way

And I can learn
And I make mistakes
I haven't changed my mind this is how I feel,
This is how I feel today

I made the choice
To live life without your love
The time has gone by
And still it's you I'm thinking of
To be without you
Makes me regret each day
I chose to live this way

I made the choice
To live life without your love
The time has gone by
And still it's you I'm thinking of
To be without you
Makes me regret each day
I chose to live this way

What is need,
Something to claim?
Without you love,
I won't be the same
