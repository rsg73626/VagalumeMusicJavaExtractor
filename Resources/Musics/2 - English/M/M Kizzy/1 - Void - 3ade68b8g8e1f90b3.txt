VOID

Lonely, my Darling
now this is my choice
I have nobody
Nobody, no more

I want the world to give up on me
when I decided to open up myself, you rejected me
you don't know the void I feel inside of me
I don't wanna feel anymore
It hurts too much

so I stay away from all
nobody realizes I'm not well
Lonely, my Darling
now this is my choice

But you didn't get it
I needed you you you
But you didn't get it
It was true true true

I'm fever, fever, fever
Your love is like a candy
But you didn't want to share
I got sick like hell
And you seem not to care

why don't you understand?
What is in here, in me, in myself
why don't you understand?
What is in here, in me
(It's a heart trying to survive)
