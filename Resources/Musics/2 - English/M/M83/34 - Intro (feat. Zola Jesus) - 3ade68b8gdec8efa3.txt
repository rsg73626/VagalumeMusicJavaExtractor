INTRO (FEAT. ZOLA JESUS)

We didn't need a story
We didn't need a real world
We just had to keep walking
And we became the stories
We became the places
We were the lights, the deserts, the faraway worlds
We were you before you even existed

I carry on, carry on, carry on
And after us the flood
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Our silver horn it leads the way

Banners of gold shine
In the cold in the cold in the cold
Footprints of snow
Blind from the road
Hail!

We carry on, carry on
Follow us we are one
The battle's fought, the deed is done
Our silver hum runs deep and strong

Hand to the heart, lips to the horn
We can save, we can be reborn
Head on my breast, I'll keep you warm
Hail!
