SOLITUDE

Somewhere, back in time
I left a part of me
I want to see if you can try
To bring it back to me

You've got to go, where I cry
And take in all the tears
I want to see if you can try
Drink a little bit of me

No
No

Just a little lonely
Where I am
Take me back in time
I want to see if you can smile
If I become a better man

I need you - now I know
Just give me one more chance
I'm gonna try and be your friend
So we can beat the end

No
No

No
No
