GO! (FEAT. MAI LAN)

You meet me at the station
Can't get used to patience
Wish time this time could just be a bit shortened
Between us six million seasons
Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Our love, our love
Ran away, ran away
Gotta save it, gotta save it
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you

Our love, our love
Ran away, ran away
Gotta save it, gotta save it
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for you

Feels like we will be frozen
Need you to tell me je t'aime
Full speed because we got a lot to discover
Get me just a little closer

I'm gonna come just meet me there
I'm gonna come just meet me there
I'm gonna
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for you
