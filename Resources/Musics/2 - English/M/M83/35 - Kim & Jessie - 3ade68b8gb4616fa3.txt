KIM & JESSIE

Kim and Jessie
They have a secret world in the twilight
Kids outside worlds
They are crazy about romance and illusion

Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah yeah yeah

Dream dressed in blue
It’s all they need for now
And forever

Chased by the moon
They shatter their whole peace
With singing

Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah yeah yeah

Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah yeah yeah

So we can drown our towns with voices
So possible to like it as one
And soon they’ll be flying
Say “of course,” say “you’re lovely”

Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
