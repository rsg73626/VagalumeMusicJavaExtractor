GOODBYE/ FAREWELL

Kiss on the mouth, bliss of a touch
Hand in a hand, killing the fiend
I'll write my love on more than a thousand weeping willows

A walk on your voice
So far, so close
A whispering child so cold, so mild
All the colors mixed up in falls of rainbows

Tears on your neck, holding you near
Sparkling shells, three comet tails
Hoping for some magic to make your heart beat next to mine

Shiny island, blue underground
My everyday is fading away
I'm flying through the wind and whistling some strange melody

Hang on to me getting out of my corpse
Please dont leave me watching you from the clouds
Melancholy, you'll join me soon my love
Feeling frozen, I'll warm you everynight
Falling asleep,

I'll travel in your dreams
