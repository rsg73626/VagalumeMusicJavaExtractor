OBLIVION

Since I was young, I knew I'd find you
But our love was a song
Sung by a dying swan

And in the night, you hear me calling
You hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling

Breathe in the light
I'll stay here in the shadows
Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows
Higher, and higher, and higher

And when the nights are long
All the stars recall your goodbye, your goodbye

And in the night
You'll hear me calling, you'll hear me calling
And in your dreams, you'll see us falling, falling

And in the night, you'll hear me calling
You'll hear me calling
And in your dreams, you'll see us falling, falling

Breathe in the light and say goodbye
Breathe in the light and say goodbye
