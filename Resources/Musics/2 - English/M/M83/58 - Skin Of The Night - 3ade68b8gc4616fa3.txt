SKIN OF THE NIGHT

Like a moth she moves to the red light
Her blood warms and boils there
She skims the sweat like a new milk
As pops the buttons off her wet blouse

Oh Queen of the Night!
Well she is deep inside!
She is haunting me!
All of her soft parts call to me
She could be mine...

She digs her nails into her naked chest
Miles of veins fan out like a road map
She pulls back the skin to show her ribs
That twinkle like shooting stars.

Oh Queen of the Night!
Well she is deep inside!
She is haunting me!
All of her soft parts call to me
She could be mine...
