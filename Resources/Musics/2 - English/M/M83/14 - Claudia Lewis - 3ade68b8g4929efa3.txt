CLAUDIA LEWIS

Alone, twenty millions years from my place
A slide, on a starlight
Watch out, a new planet right on my trail!
The space, oh oh, it's mine!
Oh oh! oh oh oh! oh! oh oh oh!

I'm lost, in an infinite night trip
The sun, could make me blind
I wish, I could bring a girl to my ship
And fly, her hand in mine!
Oh oh! oh oh oh! oh! oh oh oh!

Alone, twenty millions years from my place
(is it dream over?)
The space, oh oh it's mine!
