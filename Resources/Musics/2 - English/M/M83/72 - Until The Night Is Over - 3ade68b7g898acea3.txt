UNTIL THE NIGHT IS OVER

I am cold
and I'm lost
I'm standing in the rain
I'm not strong
anymore
I'm just waiting for the sun

I am cold
and I'm lost (I am cold)
I'm standing in the rain
(I'm standing in the rain)
I'm not strong
anymore (and I'm lost)
I'm just waiting for the sun
(I'm just waiting for the sun)
