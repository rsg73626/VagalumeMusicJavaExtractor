DO IT, TRY IT

Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it

Listen to the sound of a new tomorrow
Take over my dreams
Walk into the feeling

A dance
On repeat
A trance
On a hard beat

A dance
On repeat
A trance
On a hard beat

Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it

Listen to the sound
Like a shout in the night
Moving at the tempo
Of a broken song

A dance
On repeat
A trance
On a hard beat

A dance
On repeat
A trance
On a hard beat

Listen to the sound
Of a broken heart
Calling for a sign of love
Heal me up
Turn me on

(A dance
On repeat
A trance
On a hard beat)

A dance
On repeat
A trance
On a hard beat

Heal me up
Back me down
Turn me on
I'm alone

Heal me up
Back me down
Turn me on
I'm alone
