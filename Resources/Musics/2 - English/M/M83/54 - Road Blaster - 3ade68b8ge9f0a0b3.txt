ROAD BLASTER

I was driving at the dawn
But everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I see you
Calling love to the land
Cause anything I do,
Anything I do
Is about you

I was searching at the speed of sound
And I go up and down
Until I hit the ground

I need someone

I was falling through the universe
I went forward and reverse
To forget about you

Now you get me
Just another soul to break
Evil is God and I'm going straight to Hell
