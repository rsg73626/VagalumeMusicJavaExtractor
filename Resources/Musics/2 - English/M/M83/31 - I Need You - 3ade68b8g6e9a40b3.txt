I NEED YOU

Have you ever had a feeling
That we're not alone
Hold to call the feeling senile
They unearth one
Going down the dust roads
We are cold and see-through
I need you

There's a reason after all
All the thing that I have done
Pump the blood and leave it alone
Anywhere you take me

See It all

Just go and solve it all
