HOLES IN THE SKY (FEAT. HAIM)

Arms to the ground, far from the river
Grace in our tears, high on a fever

Somebody heal me from my pain

I'm reaching closer
And stars dive on earth
Feeling up, lost in memories

Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody tell me this is real

Hands to the sky, I am a dreamer
We build our hope, we are believers

Somebody free me from my chains

I'm reaching closer
My stars dive, no one heard
Feeling up, my memories

Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody pull me from the dark

Arms to the ground, far from the river
Somebody heal me from my pain
Hands to the sky, I am a dreamer
Somebody free me from my chains
