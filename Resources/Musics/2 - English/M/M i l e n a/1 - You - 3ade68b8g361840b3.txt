YOU

Please me baby
Cause I'm going to believe you
Kiss me maybe, Like I want to kiss you
You want my attention, you do

But darling, you, you know me like no one

Say what you have to say
but don't use that phone
Write letters every day and send it to my home
You want my attention, you do

But darling, you, you know me like no one

Take me back to your side
Turn me black while you're white
I want your attention, I do

But darling, you, you know me like no one

No one, tchup tchup, No one... No one
