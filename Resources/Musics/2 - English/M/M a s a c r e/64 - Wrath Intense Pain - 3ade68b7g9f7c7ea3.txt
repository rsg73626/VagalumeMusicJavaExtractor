WRATH INTENSE PAIN

Wrath!!! 
Approaching the fear of so many men 
Killing their cries and their despair 
During war and peace they turned into 
Life and death of a whole country 
Wrath, pain 
Liars shielding behind their ideas 
Old guerrillas government of the right 
Everybody is making promises 
To our peoples, misery 
They will kill your strong desires 
And throw down all of your dreams 
Exploitation raping all your rights 
Dead bodies, more dead bodies 
Wrath, pain 
Wrath, intense pain 
Finish all of my grief 
All the blood that runs through my veins 
Wonâ€™t be spilled out by violence 
All the strong force of my despair 
Gets with one cry all the peace I desire 
All the strong force of my despair 
Gets with one cry all the peace I desire 
Wrath, Intense Pain 
Wrath, Intense Pain 
Wrath, Intense Pain 
Approaching the fear of so many men 
Killing their cries and their despair 
During war and peace they turned into 
Life and death of a whole country

Wrath, Pain, come on!!!
