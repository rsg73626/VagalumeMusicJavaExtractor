KILL OR GET KILLED

Anguish violent cries 
Tears of blood and sweat 
Death and desolation 
Living blind with fear 
Right now they breathe drugs that smell like death 
Because of misery the murderers born 
Reality killing by nature 
Because of injustice and impunity 
They suffocate in their dreams and ideals 
They asphyxiate their willingness to live 
Brothers will kill again their own brothers 
Brothers will kill again their own brothers 
Kill 
Gaining more ground 
To kill more and more 
With an empty and defying look 
With deceiving laughter and grin 
With tongues stained of poison 
Triggers of their own law 
They dominate 
The mountains while rivers 
Of blood of defenceless men 
Flow down from the hills 

Brothers will kill again their own brothers 
Brothers will kill again their own brothers 
Kill 
Gaining more ground 
To kill more and more 
With an empty and defying look 
With deceiving laughter and grin 
With tongues stained of poison 
Triggers of their own law 
They dominate 
The mountains while rivers 
Of blood of defenceless men 
Flow down from the hills 
Anguish violent cries 
Tears of blood and sweat 
Death and desolation 
Living blind with fear
