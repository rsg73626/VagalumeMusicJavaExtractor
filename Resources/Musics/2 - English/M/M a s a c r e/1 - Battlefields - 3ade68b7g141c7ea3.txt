BATTLEFIELDS

My own sadness
I saw the way how they died
In their beds full of anguish
Your hands are tied
Violent men have killed
People before
My eyes, no more!!!
Next to me rivers of blood
Flooding fields of this country
I mourn for this
Reality, crude rage
These are wounds in
My soul, no more!!!
Used up the nation’s resources
These ones raping the others
Thousand bullets buzzing by
Massacred in battlefields
We’re picking up from the ground
Human bones, ashes, bodies
Battlefields,
