DEATH METAL FOREVER

Death!!!
Disfiguring all the merits
Resuscitating the dead ones
Everything is razed after their steps
So dark, so gloomy, it’s just pathetic
I will carry on all of my fears
All over my back there’s more and more pain
Just because of this absurd violence
Bullets entering into the bodies
Metal burns up inside my head
A strong mourning feel, lots of bitterness
Crying out, despair, my anguish is rising
Death!!!
