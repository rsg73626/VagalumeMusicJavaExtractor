VICTIMS

Victims of the present
Of consequences foretold
Ripe fruits of this violence
Die!!!
Buying weapons for our war
While they talk of truce and peace
So many fields are mined
Die!!!
Mutilated mercenaries
Countrymen and peasants
All of them massacred
Nation, gunfire
Dying of starvation
Falling on bloody fields
Anguish, fear, crying
Ambushed soldiers
Falling assassinated
Daily we feel
Anguish, fear, crying
Mutilated mercenaries
Countrymen and peasants
All of them massacred
Harvesting tons of cocaine
Our towns are devastated
All their blood spilled out in vain
Gain more and more dead bodies
Victims of this violence
Victims of this warfare
Victims of this violence
Victims of this warfare

Victims of the present
Of consequences foretold
Ripe fruits of this violence
Die!!!
Buying weapons for our war
While they talk of truce and peace
So many fields are mined
Die!!!
