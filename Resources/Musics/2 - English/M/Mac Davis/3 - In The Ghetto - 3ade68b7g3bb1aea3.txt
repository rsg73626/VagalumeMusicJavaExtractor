IN THE GHETTO

I could just sit around making music all day long.
As long as I'm making my music, ain't gonna do nobody no harm.
And who knows, maybe I'll come up with a song
To make people want to stop all their fussing and fighting
Long enough to sing along.
I believe in music.
Oh, I believe in love.
And I believe in music.
Oh, I, I believe in love.
Music is love, and love is music, if you know what I mean.
People who believe in music are the happiest people I've ever seen.
So clap your hands and stomp your feet and shake your tambourine,
And lift your voices to the sky; tell me what you see.
I, I believe in music.
Oh, I believe in love.
I believe in music.
Oh, I, I believe in love.
Music is the universal language, and love is the key
To peace, hope, and understanding, and living in harmony.
So grab your brother by the hand, let's sing along with me,
And lift your voices to the sky; tell me what you see.
I, I believe in music.
Oh, I, I believe in love.
I, I believe in music.
Oh, I, I believe in love.
