BABY DON'T GET HOOKED ON ME

Girl, you're gettin' that look in your eyes
And it's startin' to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me
Just keep it friendly, girl, 'cause i don't wanna leave
Don't start clingin' to me, girl, 'cause i can't breathe

Chorus
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
'cause i'll just use you then i'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman-child
And it's warm where you're touchin' me
But i can tell by your tremblin' smile
You're seein' way too much in me
Girl, don't let your life get tangled up with mine
'cause i'll just leave you, i can't take no clingin' vine

Chorus
Chorus fades
