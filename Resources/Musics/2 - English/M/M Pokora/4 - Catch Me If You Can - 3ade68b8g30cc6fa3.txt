CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

I been travellin' all over the world
Talk to some of the most beautiful girls
Ain't no playa no
I ain't sayin' that
But they always seem
To get so attached

So if ya callin' my phone
Leave a message
Black, blond, brunette, even red heads
It don't mean
We gonna be together
Just because we ....
Don't mean that we gonna be forever
I'm sayin'

[Refrain x4]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Catch me if you can

I've been on the road
Goin' show to show
Stayin' busy
I'm always on the go
Friendly wit da ladies
From town to town
And they all keep tryin' to
Lock me down

So if ya knock on my door
Keep on knockin'
You want me to slow down
Baby I can't
It don't mean
We gonna be together
Just because we ....
Don't mean that we gonna be forever
I'm sayin'

[Refrain x4]

After all we've done
Had a lot of fun
Did it til' the sun came up
But it's over now
I can't stick around
Girl I gotta go
After all the love we made
Til' we meet again
Catch me if u can

[Refrain x4]

Catch me if you can [x4]
