TOKIO GIRL

Knew it when I looked at you
And you looked the other way
Had to make you understand
I wanted you to stay

So many here tonight but
I only see your face
You got me open now
Girl you give me something to chase

Baby set your mind free
Standing right in front of me
Tell me what it's gonna be

I can see you wanna dance
Why don't you just take my hand

Don't be scared to let it go
Don't be scared to let it go
Dont' be scared baby let it go
You can be my Tokyo Girl
When you move across the floor
Looking so incredible
Don't be scared baby let it go
You should be my Tokyo Girl

It's such a foreign feeling
In such a foreign place
Red lights are everywhere
And girl it's getting late

Let's go somewhere where we can
Do what lovers do
I know we've never met
But I'm going crazy for you

Baby set your mind free
Standing right in front of me
Tell me what it's gonna be

I can see you wanna dance
So just take my hand,girl
Refrain

Oh
Thought I'm fighting my attraction
I can't help it
I need to know
If you really want it
If you're ready
Girl let's go

Oh
I can tell by your reaction
It's our time now
On the floor
If you really want it
If you're ready
Girl let's go!

Refrain x2

Don't be scared to let it go
Don't be scared to let it go
