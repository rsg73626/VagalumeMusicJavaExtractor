LIKE A CRIMINAL

Like A Criminal

Girl
Tell me what's happen now
I wanna make it work but
Tell me what's the use
You keep on listening
To what your friends keep saying
And you won't even let
Me give you an excuse
All of a suden
Everything that I say
Don't mean nothing
I thought that my heart would be enough
Every relationship
Revolves around trust
And loving
But you make it hard to stay in love
Cause I feel like I guil... ty...
Un... til...
Pro... ven
You...
Caught...
Me...
Red...
Han... ded...
You make me feel like a criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
A criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
I feel like a criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
A criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
New look
Look
In the beginning
I tried top play it by the book
It didn't work
No matter how hard
That I tried to give you my side of the story
You still believe you girls...
All of a suden
Everything that I say
Don't mean nothing
I thought that my heart would be enough
Every relationship
Revolves around trust
And loving
But you make it hard to stay in love
Cause I feel like I guil... ty...
Un... til...
Pro... ven
You...
Caught...
Me...
Red...
Han... ded...
You make me feel like a criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
A criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
I feel like a criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
A criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
Coz I feel like I'm guil... ty...
Un... til...
Pro... ven
Innocent
You...
Caught...
Me...
Red...
Han... ded...
You make me feel like a criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
A criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
I feel like a criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
A criminal
Lock me up throw away the key
