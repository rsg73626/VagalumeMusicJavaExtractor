SHE'S DANGEROUS

She's got an appetit that won't stop
the way that she's dancing should be against the law
She likes to show off
Her body act like the life for a party
And make it hard for you to keep her
And it's just a matter of time
For it starts to play with your mind
She's supersonic and her eyes are so hypnotic
I used to think that she was innocent, girl.

[Chorus] x2:
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous

She'll do anything for a good time
She'll break your back it sounds like last time
She's so exotic and it's so amazing
She's the perfect girl for any occasion
And it's just a matter of time
For she starts to play with your mind
That girl is evil and her love should be illegal
You'll get to close her fear all ... wanna be her

[Chorus] x2:
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous
