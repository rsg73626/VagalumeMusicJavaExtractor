DANGEROUS

Dangerous... Dangerous... Dangerous...

She's got an appetit 
That won't stop 
The way that she's dancing 
Should be against the law 
She likes to show off 
Her body act 
Like the life for a party 
And make it hard for you 
To keep her 
And it's just 
A matter of time 
For it starts to play 
With your mind 
She's supersonic 
And her eyes 
Are so hypnotic 
I used to think 
That she was innocent 
Girl 

Refrão (2x): 
She's got the passion 
That girl is dangerous 
Better be careful 
That girl is dangerous 
Beautiful hard way 
That girl is dangerous 
She's dangerous, dangerous (2x) 

She'll do anything 
For a good time 
She'll break your back 
It sounds like last time 
She's so exotic 
And it's so amazing 
She's the perfect girl 
For any occasion 
And it's just 
A matter of time 
For she starts to play 
Wwith your mind 
That girl is evil 
And her love 
Should be illegal 
You'll get to close 
Her fear all 
Wanna be her 

Refrão (2x): 
She's got the passion 
That girl is dangerous 
Better be careful 
That girl is dangerous 
Beautiful hard way 
That girl is dangerous 
She's dangerous, dangerous (2x)
