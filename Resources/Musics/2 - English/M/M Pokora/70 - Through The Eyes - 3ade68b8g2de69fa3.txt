THROUGH THE EYES

Through The Eyes Lyrics

You can watch disaster
Yes, without pain
See a million people
Standing homeless in the rain

You can read about it
Be outraged
You can change the channel
Turn the page

It is somebody's problem
Not your problem, no
You can try to forget it
Close your eyes

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby girl
Try to see what she sees
Out of this crazy world

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby boy
Try to see what he sees
In a world been destroyed

Hey you, it's time to look alive
Hey you, we gotta help those kids to survive

Listen people, can't you see?
It's between you and me,
We can change destiny
You and me, we must agree
To step out tragedy
Find a way set them free

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby girl
Try to see what she sees
Out of this crazy world

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby boy
Try to see what he sees
In a world been destroyed

(You can make a difference)
Don't pretend you can't see that
(Can't go pretending)
Don't pretend you can't see that
(You can make a difference)
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby girl
Try to see what she sees
Out of this crazy world

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby boy
Try to see what he sees
In a world been destroyed

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby girl
Try to see what she sees
Out of this crazy world

Looking out through the eyes
Of a sweet baby boy
Try to see what he sees
In a world been destroyed


Yo 2008
It's time to open your eyes man
