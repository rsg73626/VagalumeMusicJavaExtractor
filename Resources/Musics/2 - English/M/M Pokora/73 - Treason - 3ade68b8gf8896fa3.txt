TREASON

Never thought a girl would try and play me like this
Never thought I'd be a fool betrayed by a kiss
The love we had between us did it exist
I'll never know now I'll never know

So come along with your alibis
They're juste evil lies to me
I can see it written in your eyes
This is no surprise
So tell it to your others baby

The words I'm hearing are sounding like treason
The way I'm feeling it's leaving me cold
The air between us is dropping to freezin'
What's the reason
For your treason

Oooh yeah

Guess messing with my boy is setting the tone
I'm left in pieces and it's hurting me so
Coz I gave you everything my body and soul
We're so over we're so over

You and me forever just the other day
But now I'm so betrayed
There's no way you could make it better

Refrain

The worlds I'm hearing are sounding like treason
Wish I was dreaming it's hurting for real
I think I've heard enough and I should be leaving
No more teasing
This is treason


Guilty as charged you left me for dust
Why'd you do it girl
Tore me apart now you're breaking my trust
Why you're breaking my world
I never thought girl you'd push it that far
Wanna push it now
But I guess I learned just who you really are
Come on come on

Refrain

Never thought a girl whould try and play me like this
Never thought I'd be a fool betrayed by a kiss
The love we had between us did it exist
I'll never know now I'll never know

Refrain

The worlds I'm hearing are sounding like treason
Wish I was dreaming it's hurting for real
I think I've heard enough and I should be leaving
No more teasing
This is treason
