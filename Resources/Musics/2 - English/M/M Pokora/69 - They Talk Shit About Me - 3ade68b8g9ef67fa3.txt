THEY TALK SHIT ABOUT ME

He's my number one
They keep telling me don't trust a beautiful girl
But they can't get no girl like me
Sexy like a strip show
But she got the brains though
Tagg team she's my M.V.P
They ain't into us
They're so envious
Trying to tell me that my girl is too dangerous
But she's my Mrs P
That's p for perfection
Her attention is all I need
There goes my baby
And ain't she the real thing
I got her now... he's my number one...

He's my darlin
And he got my heart set
I'm talking about
She's my number one...
They talk shit about me
Oooohhhh
All my girlfriends are j j jealous
They don't like my man cause he's g g generous
Thinking that they're way way way ahead of us
They keep telling us it's won't never last
He's a bad influence
They so envious
I think the gravity is stronger' cause I'm falling fast
Two halves make a whole
Two hearts make a soul
My body, you're body baby do the math...
There goes my baby
And ain't she the real thing
I got her now... He's my number one...

He's my darling
And she got my heart set
I'm talking about
She's my number one...
They talk shit about me
Come on they talk shit about me
My girl is a permanent fixture, jamaican and latina
And affirmative mixture
You talk about him bad, I'm a bury you six foot
Cause he gone be my man 'til the planet has blown up
She's my Venus, galaxy's can't get in between us
We're Adam and Eve with a remix
I'd get he a star from heaven but I can't reach it
I can't find a diamond as beautiful as she is
We go toge... we go to ge ge gether
Don't listen to you will lonely as girlfriends ever,
Remember baby you're the Ben & Jerry's I'm the cone
You're the stone I'm the setting you won't ever be alone
Ha no! 'cause I'm only a call away ay ay
And though they say it just another cliche eh eh
She's my lady and they say no face
She's my lady...

Jl'aime depuis le lycee
There goes my baby
Ans ain't she the real thing
I got her now... He's my number one...
He's my darlin'
And he got my heart set
I'm talking about
She's my number one...
There goes my baby,
And ain't she the real thing
I got her now... He's my number one...
They talk shit about me
