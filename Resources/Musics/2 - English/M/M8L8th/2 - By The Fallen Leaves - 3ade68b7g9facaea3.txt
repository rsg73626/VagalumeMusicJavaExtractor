BY THE FALLEN LEAVES

Sunrise. The sunset. Hundred thousand years 
Sunwheel grants his magic Light to Earth. 
Blood and Flesh as Night and the Dawn through a cold fog 
In the world where Death has presented my mind to dreams. 
Where branches by the fallen leaves, the snow by the veil 
Has covered by a severe Fatherly hand 
Those who found out a deceit, seen the Sun beams, 
Where Darkness and Fog and cold of the frosty night. 
Horror of sufferings in attack's bayonets 
In bloody textures of banners and Anger. 
And blizzard by despair of the fallen ones 
Dressing Heroes' obscurity in the garment of Eternity. 
Where branches by the fallen leaves, the snow by the veil 
Has covered by a severe Fatherly hand 
Those who found out a deceit, seen the Sun beams, 
Where Darkness and Fog and cold of the frosty night.
