SCUM

Whisper of trees abates, 
Wind of Sparkling Ice 
Has broken off, doesn't laugh by inflow - 
Water helplessly cries . 
By the roots Land sinks 
Into the tombs where hatred awaits 
When stinky scum will come crawling 
To the Russian Land 
They deprives of anyone's own will, 
But give the ringing of rusty fetters. 
They don't need in free people, 
The slaves are necessary - as much as possible! 
And the Sky - burnt by steel, 
Does not flow to the Earth as rain, 
But Aryan blood flows to rivers 
By the boiling bloody stream. 
Burn, scum! 
Once there was no lie here, 
Now only in cold tombs 
Forgotten Wisdom is kept, 
And it's possible for us - to recollect it 
Once doors will open, 
And the Cold of Underground Ice 
Will kill this scum and Russian People 
Will crucify it again for ever
