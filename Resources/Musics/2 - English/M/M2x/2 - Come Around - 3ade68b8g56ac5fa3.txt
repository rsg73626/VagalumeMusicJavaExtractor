COME AROUND

It's friday night I need summit to do
gotta find myself a pass time
how about you?
we could, hit the streets
find our way to a bar
roll up some weed
take some shit too far
cuz no matter the price
we gotta slide on ice
if the weather is nice
we gon' roll our dice
see what comes next
maybe a shot or six
whatever is the fix
it's gon' smash like a hit cuz on a friday
things are supposed to be crazy
like preparation for the days to come, celebration
it's weekend, the best two days of the week
when everyone go crazy, no time to be meak
weak people are no longer seethrough
beef is peaceful
find a house with a seaview
and let the drinks flow
to energize souls
let the night roll
it's a party now yo

Chorus2X;
come around make some noise it's the weekend now
decide it's your choice don't be weakened now
it's gonna be a WOW time
you here? It's about time
brought some beer? let's get started

Verse 2;
I try to be who I am and who I am is the man
who loves alcohol and who comes with a plan
I make preparations and go to the store
come home with three boxes of beer and some more
like Tequila, Malibu, what satisfies you?
make a list and I get it but you gotta spend some cash
too
we all cash in on this adolescent sin
for head spins don't come free in crazy ass binges
gather round now I got a statement to make
about this long night I hope you all can relate
I'm proud of the way that this shit elevate
no hate, no breaks for a fight yo it's great
hope you all had a blast but it's now in the past
it's time to hit the sack
tomorrow we continue
with saturdays venue
no breaks on this shit, so pause for a bit, lay back
smoke a spliff

Chorus2X;
come around make some noise it's the weekend now
decide it's your choice don't be weakened now
it's gonna be a WOW time
you here? It's about time
brought some beer? let's get started

Speech;
and so the young unshaven man walked slowly down the
street
finding his way to the closest open store
he enters and brings out his cash and picks up four
boxes of beer,
some vodka, some tequila and some malibu
well pretty much anything to get this fuckin shit
started

Chorus;
come around make some noise it's the weekend now
decide it's your choice don't be weakened now
it's gonna be a WOW time
you here? It's about time
brought some beer? let's get started

it's gonna be a blast
no doubt about that
who cares about the past
when a spliff is being passed
so crack your beer open
and yo keep it drunk
prepare to be smoking
some top notch skunk
