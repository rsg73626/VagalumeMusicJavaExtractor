RAFTING THRU DREAMS

I feel so empty in my head sometimes it's just mad
like rafting around in a dream but never sad
I see a night sky with stars shining bright
to my right is a car by a wall and it's white
right, enough with the scene setting here
adhere to the story of Chris when he steer
thru rivers and valleys to political rally's
got people around, specially one guy, O'Malley
a farmer living at the purple haze fields
yields 50 tonnes of supreme mass appeal
for real, people come from all over the planet
to try some of this shit, like this one chick, Janet
Janet was still young like 16 years old
but she toked like a master and held all the smoke
I was like whoa, yo just pass me that shit
so we transfered the smoke with a long ass kiss
I was bliss but I ran through yellow green grass
with some hasch in my palm I crashed on a lawn
next to this one guy, he called himself Satan
a sorry motherfucker who just wouldnt stop debating
about what is right and about what is wrong
in the way u hold the light when you're lighting up a bong
Wrong! he said in a fair annoying voice
u gotta angle it man come here let me show!
NO! I said Fuck You! I'm gonna light it
it doesnt matter bout the angle
its the shit u gotta handle
