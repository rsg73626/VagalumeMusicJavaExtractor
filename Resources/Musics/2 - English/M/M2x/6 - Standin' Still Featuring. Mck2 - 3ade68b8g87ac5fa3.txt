STANDIN' STILL FEATURING. MCK2

I'm following the road but I got no destination/
it's a rough way to walk when you're born procrastinating/
the way I seem to live cause a violent debate/
all this hate and criticism seem to be ceiling my fate/
but I keep on living drunk with determination crazy/
until my mind has sunk to the concentration lazy/
but maybe, just maybe, can I be living my life/
without the presence of critics shining the bright light/
so I take a break, a break from reality/
pop off the cap, take a big sip and vanish in a daze/
where pain is no longer an issue/
and rain is followed by the mist of resistance/
so glistening is the night sky which I'm under/
as I pass out reminicing 'bout my past, what a blunder/
I never believed in God but at this point/
at the brink of my death I'll do anything to run/

Chorus;
I'm standin' still
Got my life locked down, caught in chains, got no name, feeling my mind go insane
I'm standin' still
for every can that I empty, death gon' tempt me, can't find a way to vent me
I'm standin' still
I know I can end it but it seems impossible, I caused the fall, GOD SO MERCIFUL
Help me up
cuz otherwise I'm doomed to call for the devil to rescue me
God I've lost it all

Verse 2;
Yo I'm standin' still, got nowhere to go no more/
my greatest thrill in life is a big fat roll/
a big phat load into my bong to smoke/
what a question to be raised, am I destined to toke?/
I had the ball in my court but I kicked it away/
then I ran off the pitch where the trouble had stayed/
I picked it back up cuz I'm nothing without it/
a shadow in the dark wheter I'm quiet or shout it/
cuz no one can hear it/
so noone can fear it/
if noone can see it/
then it doesn't exist/
man it's sicken√≠ng to witness the way this world resist to accept that their own young is mixed in this shit/
instead we cover it up with the fasade of famine/
which of course is important but our lives are cramming/
so instead I turn to you God, help us up/
cuz nobody cares here, without you we're fucked/

Chorus;
I'm standin' still
Got my life locked down, caught in chains, got no name, feeling my mind go insane
I'm standin' still
for every can that I empty, death gon' tempt me, can't find a way to vent me
I'm standin' still
I know I can end it but it seems impossible, I caused the fall, GOD SO MERCIFUL
Help me up
cuz otherwise I'm doomed to call for the devil to rescue me
God I've lost it all

im standing still, poppin cap after cap till ive had my fill, had my thrill
at the prospect of gettin my sadness killed,
fuckin drunk got me freestyling ill with da maddest skills. but as the booze
laid heavy on my brain, knew i choose 2
lose myself only to wake up again and pay my way with pain and then, give
you an introduction to my love for self destruction
my obsession with beer is as incessant as im fessin my cheer at this
socially accepted depressant. but im just guessin.
U ask for help when youve accepted a problem, denial will have you mired so
bad you cant even solve em, anger is next youre
so mad you get hexed, the abomination of negotiatin with the devil comes
next. only then you can learn to face your demons,
stare m down burn em in your dark side that needs em

Chorus;

MCK2;
now it only took me one verse to explain this shit, but ima stick to you
twice so it sustain a bit, as it resounds like these sweet defenseless
voilins
gettin drunk is an act of senseless violence.solve yo probs wether is yo
bitch yo job or yo fam or your wealth thats the only way to
deal wit the hand thats dealt and melt the ice cold pain thats felt. cuz
excuses are useless when your just bein yourself
