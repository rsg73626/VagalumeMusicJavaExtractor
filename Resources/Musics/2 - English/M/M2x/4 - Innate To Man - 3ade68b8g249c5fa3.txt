INNATE TO MAN

I'm sick of whores on the internet babbling
leaving spam but there tracks is all rambling
about sensless nonsense
their topics is a constant rip off stardom struck rappers
and still they got balls to call themselves lyrical
and on top of that genius? typical pityfull
money come this, money come that
but still they're stuck at home and they're paying with scraps
I'm not lying to you when I say I dont bring any money in from rapping but I see it as a hobby, a pin
to express my thoughts and my feelings
every fucking word I put on paper is a feeling I feel I need to portray
no less of a symbolism in the weed tracks I create
it's for the stoners to relate
every single problem can be split in to verses
if I got 'em and you got 'em then you'll understand why I disperse this

Chorus:
Maybe I'm mistaking myself here by saying
the world has been taken over by self-righteous trained men
corrupted and evil, and money it seem to
make it all worse or is it innate in man

Verse 2;
and then we got them dudes doin remixes of everything
on MTV and VH1 but they never wrote anything even worth to be called a song
incapable of writing more than 16 lines, never heard of a self thought rhyme
everytime you put on a track with some famous dude you can see them with a scrapbook doing ignoramous loots
biting every word, raping every thought-through track the DJ spins
they're burdons on the whole hip hop society
erasing every hope for a mainstream variety
but yo these are obstacles not too hard to overcome
cuz I also know there are serious and skilled rappers all over the world waiting to spit some
of that crazy shit, like DZK spinning that razor shit
rap is all off from that racist shit
black on white hate, white on black debates are through ok!

Chorus:
Maybe I'm mistaking myself here by saying
the world has been taken over by self-righteous trained men
corrupted and evil, and money it seem to
make it all worse or is it innate in man

Verse 3;
and then we got critics who dont know shit about rap
but still give opinion saying its shit and all that
everytime some underground track breaks through the barrier
then its resentful, an evil and hate carrier
but what about them governments sendin hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the frontlines of some far away country
which dont even post a threat except for the oil companies and the money of wealthy old fat monkeys
it's pathetic to think that our whole society is run by business' economies and the "belief to be free"
but still when a crime is committed by some leader of an organisation he can buy his fuckin freedom
he's the juggernaut while some simple person will take the blow
prison for life and the CEO can go home to sniff his blow
which was imported and funded for by the same government who would send you or me to death fo' sho

Chorus:
Maybe I'm mistaking myself here by saying
the world has been taken over by self-righteous trained men
corrupted and evil, and money it seem to
make it all worse or is it innate in man
