FREEDOM TO THE HATRET

we gotta do something
about these stressed angers
but we can't do nothing
cuz we're controlled by rangers
stranglers
who work to cut us off
to keep controll of us
cuz no one wants us to flip on them
let's rip this track again
so I say welcome to the house of pain
have a look at my brain
and you can see the hatret
I live with sorrow
it's something sacred
something secret
so I say Freedom to the Hatret
see you later
when Ive opened my mouth
don't think I will shout
cuz I know that taking shit calmly
can hit you more badly
sadly
I dunno what to say
I'll send this ray to they who want me
to be what they see in their imagination
infiltration
toleration
Can you see me comin'
I'm running up from behind
you declined let's turn around
and stop this sound
move on with this album
I'm m2X and I'm the next generation
with my mate Nutz
the Alliance taking over the nation of Cyprus first
cuz the greeks have a certain thirst
that we need to blow
in this show
we stand in the row to fame
we live for this game
We are all full of rage
The Alliance
let's turn the page
and check out the hate
this is my mates
Crazy T Nutz
We infest you
test you
that was it
yeh
Alliance
