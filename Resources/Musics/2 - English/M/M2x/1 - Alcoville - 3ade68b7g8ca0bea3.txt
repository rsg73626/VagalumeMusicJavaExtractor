ALCOVILLE

Welcome to alcoville
The hometown off all alcomuhfuckers
Sitting in the park
Chilling and watching my best friend barf
Life feels harsh so we shoot some hard
Wait ten and start moving
It all feels good it all feels true
Life with alcohol turns you blue
Walk on clouds feel all proud that you can shoot 14 tequilla without dying
We do hit bad
We do get sad
When our friends go mad
Lose their mind and go blind
Cuss they haven't recognized their line
So they push themselves pass the limit
But fuck it who cares, you only live once
So what we do is pass our life on to our sons and daughters
Welcome to drinking land
Here i proms you
You'll become a man
Learn to shake hands with a bum without feeling dumb
We teach you how to drink a lot of beer
How to get pissed off at a queer
Be short tempered
And beat up someone for calling you tempered
What we do is start off our evening
With some beer body healing
Hit off the feeling'
And grab the gin
Taste it, grin and begin to spin
To get that amazing grace
Talk to jesus and insult his race
Those religious fucks who think we suck
Cuss we hit the bar drink and drive our car
But we are really quite harmless
Unless u harm us
The we go looking for you to smack you up till you want us to kill you
