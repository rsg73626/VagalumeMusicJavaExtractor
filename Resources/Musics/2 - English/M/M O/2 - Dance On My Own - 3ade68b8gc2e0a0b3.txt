DANCE ON MY OWN

Played me once
Played me twice
Still I don't know why I come here
Left me standing on my own
Never thought you'd be that cold

Never mind
 I'm sure ill find someone that's just like you
Should have left you time ago
Just like my friends had told me too
You can cheat with other freaks yeah
They'll believe your lies
As long as you don't waste my time
Won't be waiting on your love no more
Won't waste my time fighting
 For you like before
And leave my shh.
 Before you walk out the door
Coz I'm in heaven just me and the dance floor

So I will dance on my dance on my own
Dance on my dance on my own
Dance on my dance on my own
Standing out from the crowd
Stop pretending you don't see me
Thank you now
Take a bow
I'm the one who got away

Never mind
 I'm sure ill find someone that's just like you
Should have left you time ago
Just like my friends had told me too
You can cheat with other freaks
Yeah they'll believe your lies
As long as you don't waste my time
Won't be waiting on your love no more
Won't waste my time fighting
 For you like before
And leave my shh...
 Before you walk out the door
Coz I'm in heaven just me and the dance floor

So I will dance on my dance on my own
Dance on my dance on my own
Dance on my dance on my own
Gonna dance the night away
Watch me dancing the night away
Won't be waiting on your love no more

Won't waste my time fighting
 For you like before
And leave my shh...
 Before you walk out the door
Coz I'm in heaven just me and the dance floor
So I will dance on my dance on my own
Dance on my dance on my own
Dance on my dance on my own
