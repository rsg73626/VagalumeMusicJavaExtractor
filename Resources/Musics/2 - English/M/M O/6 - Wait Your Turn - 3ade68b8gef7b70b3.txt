WAIT YOUR TURN

Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
This is how it started out singing songs creating sounds
Don't worry because I am on my way
(ay ay ay)
Love to her them haters talk
Its because they can rock my world
Won't get up unless im getting paid
Watch and learn (dont get it in my way)
Catch a earn (while I got it everyday)

Watch and learn (dont get it in my way)
Catch a earn (while I got it everyday day ay ay ay ay)
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Wait your turn
Bringing down a supernova
Wait your turn
Dont let them get in your way
Wait wait your turn
Got to get the foreign song
Wait your turn
Try not to get in my way ay ay
Even when I play I dont play
Act like you only wanna get the best of me
Hope got away and you'll see
Im gonna do a drive by me
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Why cant we get along?
Can't do tht it would be wrong
Motivation we need it all the way ay ay ay
Like to speak up on the phone
Would not be singing this song
While gossipin' all that I can hear

Watch and learn (dont get it in my way)
Catch a earn (while I got it everyday)

Watch and learn (dont get it in my way)
Catch a earn (while I got it everyday day ay ay ay ay)
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Wait your turn
Bringing down a supernova
Wait your turn
Dont let them get in your way
Wait wait your turn
Got to get the foreign song
Wait your turn
Try not to get in my way ay ay
Even when I play I dont play
Act like you only wanna get the best of me
Hope got away and you'll see
That im gonna do a drive by me

Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh

Onc you get a little taste
You can not get
Watch a super star taking off like rocket
Saying what you say I keep talkin
Better hush your mouth when I say

Wait your turn
Bringing down a supernova
Wait your turn
Dont let them get in your way
Wait your turn
Got to get the foreign song
Wait your turn
Try not to get in my way ay ay
Even when I play I dont play
Act like you only wanna get the best of me
Hope got away and you'll see
Im gonna do a drive by me
