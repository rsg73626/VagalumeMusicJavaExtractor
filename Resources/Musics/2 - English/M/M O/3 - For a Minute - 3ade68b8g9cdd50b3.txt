FOR A MINUTE

[Hook]
And when you've only known me for a minute
I hear you've only known me for a minute
And when you've only known me for a minute
I hear you've only known me for a minute

[Verse 1]
At the start you were cool
Moved too fast if I?
You presumed way too much
No more games you're out of luck

[Verse 2]
Your compliments they made me smile
But it's too much all the time
And all the rings they were nice
But they're not worth the price

[Chrous]
Stop, don't be too quick to judge me
I'm not easy just to take for a ride
Wine and dine and show me cash
All I got is that just to please the eye
You ain't got me, got me, got me, got me
You won't win are you staying the night
You ain't got me, got me, got me, got me
You won't win are you staying the night

[Hook]
And when you've only known me for a minute
I hear you've only known me for a minute
And when you've only known me for a minute
I hear you've only known me for a minute

[Verse 3]
Stop!
Now change it up
Truth is baby I don't really give a â€¦
Now see your chat it winds me up
And lets be real it's not enough
I really thought that you could change
But all along you stayed the same
So give it up
Coz I ain't gon' give it up
So give it up
Coz I ain't gon' give it up

[Chorus]
Stop, don't be too quick to judge me
I'm not easy just to take for a ride
Wine and dine and show me cash
All I got is that just to please the eye
You ain't got me, got me, got me, got me
You won't win are you staying the night
You ain't got me, got me, got me, got me
You won't win are you staying the night

[Hook]
And when you've only known me for a minute
I hear you've only known me for a minute
And when you've only known me for a minute
I hear you've only known me for a minute

[Bridge]
Over
Over and over
Boy I said it's over
Over and over

So give it up
Coz I ain't give it up
So give it up
Coz I ain't give it up
So give it up
Coz I ain't give it up
So give it up
Coz I ain't gon' give it up

[Chorus]
Stop, don't be too quick to judge me
I'm not easy just to take for a ride
Wine and dine and show me cash
All I got is that just to please the eye
You ain't got me, got me, got me, got me
You won't win are you staying the night
You ain't got me, got me, got me, got me
You won't win are you staying the night (x2)
