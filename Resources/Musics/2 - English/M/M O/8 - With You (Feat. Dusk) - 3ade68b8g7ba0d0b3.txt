WITH YOU (FEAT. DUSK)

You say you don't wanna wake me
That's why you're coming in lightly, uh
But tell me what are you hiding?
'Cause this love is so blinding
I know you keep your bumpers down
That's why your password is out of bounds
I think I need reminding who is sleeping beside me

I never signed up for this on a paper
You love for me like you're doing me a favour
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You overthink, is your name calculator?
Don't you know that the truth's gonna save ya?
I do but it's you, it's all you

(Ooh ooh, tell me now)
Loving me like you're doing me a favour
(Tell me now)
Loving me half way
(Tell me now, tell me now)

It's like you're not on the same team
And now you're trying to bribe me
It didn't come from nothing
Don't make out like I'm crazy

And now I want to fly away
Someplace some night becomes my day
'Cause everyday I'm your side thing
You never thought I would find it

I never signed up for this on a paper
You love for me like you're doing me a favour
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You overthink, is your name calculator?
Don't you know that the truth's gonna save ya?
I do but it's you, it's all you

(Ooh oohh, tell me now)
Loving me like you're doing me a favour
(Ooh oohh, tell me now)
Loving me like you're doing me a favour
Loving me half way
(Tell me now, tell me now, now)
(Tell me now, tell me now)
You overthink, is your name calculator?
Don't you know that the truth's gonna save ya?

(Tell me now, ooh ooh, tell me now)
Loving me like you're doing me a favour
(Ooh oohh, tell me now)
Loving me like you're doing me a favour
Loving me half way
(Tell me now, tell me now)
Oh yeah yeah
(Now, tell me now, tell me now)
