LA CREME

She was sexy
She was dirty
She made love better than the rest
She was the love of my life

We did it all night long (all night long)
We did on that beach (oh yeah)
It started with me wiping off a smudge of la creme
We had fun. (oh so much fun)

Now shes gone
Gone forever
I wish we could make love again
She gave me the finest love I ever had
We made love like the night would never end
