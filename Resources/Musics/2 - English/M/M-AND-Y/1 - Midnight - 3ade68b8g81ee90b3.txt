MIDNIGHT

my lyricsbox
get ringtone
Let's go
Keep it right
Keep 'em moving

I want it loud
Can't feel the bounce
I need release
Come here with me

I want it loud
Can't feel the bounce
I need release
Come here with me

I want it louder than louder
Just keep me going and going
I promise the neighbors would know my song
Louder than louder
Just keep me going and going
Playing on the radio

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

Read my mind
Read my mind
Read my mind
Read read my mind

The speakers blow
My rhythm flows
I'll make you work
Drive you berserk

The speakers blow
My rhythm flows
I'll make you work
Drive you berserk

I want it louder than louder
Just keep me going and going
I promise the neighbors would know my song
Louder than louder
Just keep me going and going
Playing on the radio

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

Feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

Midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

[Rap]
This life is just a (?)
We try to make it rain
(?)
Stack up a lot of change
Up in this price list
The midnight's in my veins
Cause I'm the nicest

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

You feel the midnight
Running through your veins
You can read my mind
Written in the stars

Read my mind
Read my mind
Read my mind
Read read my mind
