HEARTBREAK

It's a long way back to heaven
and we're on our way togethe
I wish I was yours, forever and ever
and ever, and ever

I hide you, I keep you, I find you
and never let it go
I hide you, I keep you, I save you
and never let it go
this is how my heart breaks, together
this is how my heart breaks, forever and ever

You're tearing it apart
you're breaking my heart, forever and ever
this is how my heart breaks, forever and ever

Now it's on my mind, and it's bringing me around
and it's on my face, i'm not making a sound
I wish I could go back to heaven (to heaven)
but i'm here with you, in this world forever

I hide you, I keep you, I find you
and never let it go
I hide you, I keep you, I save you,
and never let it go

This is how my heart breaks, together
this is how my heart breaks, forever and ever

You're tearing it apart,
you're breaking my heart, forever and ever
you're tearing it apart,
you're breaking my heart, forever and ever

Every moment that I wake
every tear I never fake
every time I never stay
every minute every day

I hide you, I keep you, I find you
and never let it go
I hide you, I keep you, I save you
and never let it go
this is how my heart breaks, together (together)
this is how my heart breaks, forever and ever

You're tearing it apart
you're breaking my heart, forever and ever
This is how my heart breaks
