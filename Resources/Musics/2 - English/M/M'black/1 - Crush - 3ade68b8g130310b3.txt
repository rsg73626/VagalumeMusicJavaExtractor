CRUSH

All the lights are going down
In a world of midnight suns

I'm alone when I'm with you I never win
You're afraid of the things I've never seen
Cause every time I lose myself and you find me

And you save me--only to crush me
And you kill me--only to love me


I wish that I were someone else
Coz every time I lose myself
you save me only to crush me

I'm crashing to the ground
All the cracks are bleeding now

I'm alone when I'm with you I never win
You're afraid of the things I've never seen
Cause every time I lose myself you find me
you found me

And you save me--only to crush me
And you kill me--only to love me

I wish that I were someone else
And every time I lose myself
You save me only to crush me

It's The craziest dream I ever had
I'm crushed into pieces of blue and black
And you save me only to crush me
And you kill me only to love me

I wish that I were someone else
Coz every time I lose myself
You save me only to crush me
