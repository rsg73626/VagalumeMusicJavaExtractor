CHEVS AND FORDS

[CHORUS] 
[Mac Dre] 
Cause I'm the Chevy man 
The Chevy man? 
Yes, I'm the Chevy man 
[Lil Bruce] 
I'm a Ford man 
Mob in my old school because I can 
I'm a Ford man 
Tryin to figure eight with a blunt in my hand 

[VERSE 1: Mac Dre] 
My partner got a ElCo, my homie got a 'Maro 
He Mexicano, might rock a sombrero 
My cuzzo got a Mali' sittin on Rally's 
He candy green, might've seen him in the Valley 
My uncle got a Imp', he a pimp 
96 in the flow when he hide behind a tint 
My auntie got a 'Vette so tight she might wreck 
My cuddy got a candy Nova, he hella wet 
My granny got a 'Burban, not an Excursion 
Gramps got a Silverado, Stepside version 
My nigga Nate got a C-28 
And if the rollers get behind him, boy, he finna shake 
My folks got a glasshouse and when he mash out 
I crack the heem and pull the grass and the hash out 
Catch Dre in a trey, revvin it 
Please believe it, I'm always Chev'in it 

[CHORUS] 

[VERSE 2: Lil Bruce] 
I hit the California coast in a California Mustang 
Shelby drop-top so hot on them gold thangs 
I get the thumbs up, I like that old school Ford 
I got the 64 Falcon, all original, restored 
Sports coupe Sprint, not a ding or a dent 
390 V8, you didn't know they made them 
With my XR-7 70 work convertable 
429 Cobra Jet unservable 
I'm a Ford man, never bored, man, I got collection 
Smash on a Chevy, then I smoke the intersection 
Give us a parking lot and let the sideshow commence 
Young niggas lose on the impounds and dents 
High speeds, I knows all about em 
Old school veteran, Lil Bruce straight clownin 
I slap my shit on low and let the rollers feel my pan 
They know they can't see me cause I be the Ford man 

[CHORUS] 

[VERSE 3] 
[Lil Bruce] 
This is high speed chase play, I'm first on race day 
I'm at the stoplight with my cutthroat Mac Dre 
[Mac Dre] 
I'm at the light on slicks pushin on the throttle 
SS 400 small rock Monte Carlo 
[Lil Bruce] 
69 Falcon lights squarer than my first hoe 
427 with the fo' on the flo' 
[Mac Dre] 
Yeah, you lookin hella clean and kinda mobby 
But my gears snatch quick with this 12 valve Posie 
[Lil Bruce] 
Yeah, I like your Caddy but I'ma blow your do's 
I got the 750 double pump Holly on flows 
[Mac Dre] 
( ? ) lifters, B&M shifter 
Nitrous oxide make the Chevrolet swifter 
[Lil Bruce] 
Trick flowin hearse with the nitrous burst 
Make the sports coupe fly and the Chevy boys cry 
[Mac Dre] 
I got ported aluminum heads, I'm hella fast 
Your Ford's in my rearview, I'm seein checker flags
