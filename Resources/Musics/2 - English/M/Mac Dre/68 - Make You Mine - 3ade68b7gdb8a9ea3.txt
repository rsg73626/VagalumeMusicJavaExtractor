MAKE YOU MINE

[Woman] 
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine 
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine 

[Mac Dre] 
I went bad on a bitch but I don't love her 
She want an apology but I ain't Rueben Studdard 
I'm buttered so she jock me style 
She buttered but she not me style 
She don't got it and she ain't trying to have it 
Man I'm lavish and got expensive habits 
If I stab it what can she offer 
Naw sir dreezy ain't gon toss her 
And she thick to but I dont want her yokes 
I want all her federal reserve notes 
I'm better with no hoes over a broke one 
I'll take the ugliest bitch in Oakland 
And come through yokin Chucky Cheesed up 
You broke bitches got me fucked up 
I'm a rich nigga I got lawyers 
You broke I cant do nothin but ignore ya 

[Chorus x2] 
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine 
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine 

[Mac Dre] 
This crazy motherfucker wanna be my chick 
Always trying to fuck and suck my dick 
I won't happen you ain't got no mail 
You ain't got a snowballs chance in hell 
I'm from Vallejo where most niggaz is pimps 
We eat butterfly tiger prawns not scrimps 
On the other side of the fence is what's crackin' 
Can you detect some slackin' in my mackin? 
You can't try it unless you buy it 
Broke bitch got my dick on a diet 
Can't fuck on her and no I don't want her 
This is O.J. Simpson pimping not homer 

[Chorus x2] 
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine 
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine 

[Mac Dre] 
She trying to makeme hers 
But I can't be hers 
Unless I'm goosing her for chips and I'm taking hers 
Trying to live so fat I gotta watch calories 
It's all about a salary and that's reality 
I'm a book you shouldn'y judge by its cover hoe 
I been getting doe since Young Black Brother hoe 
I'm a brother that can make things happen 
Jacking acting macking rapping 
Let's get it crackin get the slacking out 
Everyday I blow a half an ounce 
I like to smash and bounce in all new whips 
What can we do if you ain't got a few chips? 
Take a few sips of this game I poured 
It's money in these streets and it can't be ignored 
It's money in these streets and it can't be ignored 

[Chorus x2] 
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine 
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine
