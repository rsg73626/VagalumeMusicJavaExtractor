[Messy Marv] 
Believe all what you see, and 50% of these tapes 
cuz half these rap niggas is fake

and couldn't recognize the game with bi-locals

and the mob woke up when we suppose to

and roll with all gold and chrome on one spoke

[Mac Dre] 
Hoop out the coo-nut, change over to the range rover 
mouth full of diamonds spitting like a flame thrower 
I aint sober im ripped and tilted 
half of it the remi but nigga i killed it 
damn near spilt it on my encey cloths 
its the cutthoat committiee punk we play hoes 
20 inch doe, wood grain, leather, strapped riding 
with a eagle in the desert 
its the Mac almighty, Andre Hicks 
and aint a punk rock bitch that i cant get 
and nigga I cant trip on making nothing but my scrill 
and that iz real, like a iz pill 
and i will kill, put one to yo liver 
im a pimp nigga taking everything you give up 
flossing while you suckas is starving 
im eating crab and crust-striations 
with my nigga Messy Marvin
