NOT MY JOB

[Verse 1] 
Dre rock the jewelry with the clear stones 
And get on a nigga head like some earphones 
I finna spit it, with a clear tone 
Get yo attention, the biggest thang since the T.V. invention 
Dope as yola, I'm a big shot, a show off 
Plus I'm a big pimp, I get tow off 
Fuck a good job, she need a good jaw 
And sell BJ's until her mouth get raw 
I'm from the California coast, beaches and riches 
Hit the cot, get ghost, no more sleepin' wit bitches 
I got a coughnut, sittin' on wires 
On Vogues bitch, not Michellin tires 
Can't control my desires, I buy from Nordstroms not Fred Myers 
Do a lot of weed, love my supplier 
She keep it, fuck the blood out my supplier 
Man I'm bigger than life, I do it Magnum 
And bout these broke bitches, I'm through with havin' em' 
Dre bogard, he shove and he push 
And start war for nothin' G.W. Bush 
We be lovin' the cush, but only in the backwood 
It ain't a backwood, it ain't all that good 
I'm from the streets, where most need heat 
But I slice a nigga up like some roast beef meat 

[Chorus:] 

I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job 
I peel ya cap back, but anything else, not my job 
I get ya for racks, but anything else, not my job 
I make you a slap, but anything else, not my job 

[Verse 2] 
Bitch gone ask me to come with her to grocery shop 
I told her straight up like this, "no siree bob!" 
That's not my job, I don't do that 
I'm a pimp slash rapper, I thought you knew that 
And where yo dude, should I serve em' the news 
And let him know you finna be walkin' in some brand new shoes 
Ooh, you a fool, gotta watch thy self 
One false move, and you could stop thy self 
Sometimes I'm not myself, I'm another man 
I'm a rockstar, in another band 
Plus I'm the man with plan in his hands 
Soon we'll all be playing in sand 
Cause to my estimations, and these calculations 
And all the money I made off the Rompalation 
I finna get as many didgets that's on my license plate 
I shit on some of these midgets bitch I can't wait 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
When I dip, they trip off what Furl dressed in 
Plus I got a mouth full girl's best friends 
I'm a back to the future new game kind of nigga 
Y'all lames is plain, drinkin' the same kind of liquor 
Wearin' the same kind of clothes, fuckin' the same kind of clothes 
And you bedrock pimpin', meanin' yo games kind of old 
You don't want it with me, I'll bother ya 
So get lost pal, before I clobber ya 
I got golden gloves, I give ya a new look 
With stiff left and a sharp right hook 
Niggaz know snitches, they ride and they go with them 
It's all gravy, as long as they don't tell on them 
Me and my team, see we a machine 
Fuck with my mans, and I'ma have to intervene 
I'ma sporco, and a sauncho 
Always lookin' out for Benny Blanco
