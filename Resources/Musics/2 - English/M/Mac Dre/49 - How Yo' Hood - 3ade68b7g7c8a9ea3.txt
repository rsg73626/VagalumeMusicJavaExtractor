HOW YO' HOOD

Rat-tat-tat 

[VERSE 1: Mac Dre] 
I grew up in the Bay Area, around a gang of robbin and shootin 
Looked up to legends like Felix Mitchum, Huey P. Newton 
And Todd Shaw a/k/a Too  
Blowin big hashis with dank that'll make you choke 
Young Mac Dre, causin major damage 
Back in the days I tossed hoes in the back of my ham sandwich 
Grown, gone, on bomb seed that's hemp 
Hound for potential prostitutes who need a pimp 
But now I'm bendin corners, fresh out Taradas 
Chokin on roper in the back of the Nada 
Drinkin that snake bite, Yukon jack 
And boy, I ain't ride without my strap 
Cause them cutthroat bandits will split yo wig 
In the streets of Killafornia, ya dig? 
It's goin down, dog, I'm in your town, dog 
Got to let your peeps know how I clown, dog 
In the end get it, comin with that blackhand sound 
You thinkin I can't clown? Let me put my mack hand down 

[CHORUS] 
[Killa ] How yo hood look? 
[Dre] It's full of gangsters, fool 
How yo hood look? 
[Killa] It's full of gangsters, son 
You can catch me on the Eastside, doin my thing 
[Killa] Or you can me in New York, boy, it's all the same 

[VERSE 2: Killa] 
I'm from the Eastside, where the thugs, they shed blood for nothin 
After the club you get it in your mug if you frontin 
We gangbang, it's just that our slang's a little different 
Aim a little different, spit game a little different 
Got in with the Mexicans, pricin them things a little different 
Same kinda crooks, but we cook up bricks a little different 
Them old school Chevrolets, our Six Range a little different 
Y'all gats and guns the same, but we blow brains a little different 
Them drive-by's, we walk-by's, some die a little different 
Lie a little different, testify a little different 
Y'all trees ain't got seeds, y'all beez a little different 
The d's is different, my pee's a little different 
Y'all sell bricks, we break it down, get cheese a little different 
Y'all hate narcs, we hate cops, we eat a little different 
Y'all got strips, we got spots, our blocks a little different 
It get hot a little different, fools get knocked a little different 
When the feds came, yo Dre, they took the whole block to prison 
My man pops was snitchin, his face chopped in Clinton 
If you got change and the gear hot, then switch spots, get missin 
Yo hood ain't no different, my hood ain't no different 

[CHORUS] 

[VERSE 3] 
[Dre] 
In my neighborhood everybody thuggin 
Hoodrats steady gettin dug in 
Fools buggin, mean-muggin 
Later on you seem em noggin 
[Killa] 
Dre, I play my hood all day 
Seen a fool get killed in broad day 
Thugs get money from the hallway 
2 for 5, the tall way 
[Dre] 
Ghetto slang, ghetto game 
We all just doin that ghetto thang 
Run around totin them metal thangs 
Really, homeboy, it's all the same 
[Killa] 
Yo hood is like my hood, son 
Anywhere you go thugs pullin guns 
Gangbangers, ghetto birds 
Yo hood is like my hood, ya heard? 
[Dre] 
Me and Killa finna leet you know 
How to put a lick down and get some dough 
From yo hood to Mexico 
Cause it's all about that paper, though 
[Killa] 
Put me up with Vallejo hoe 
That puff on hay, stay on the low 
Dre got work, 800 to 0 
Eastside thugs make money, you know? 
[Dre] 
I don't care where we at 
Just as long as we keep smokin fat 
Get a fifth of Hen and hopin that 
Everybody wanna stay chokin, black 
[Killa] 
I told you, Dre, our hood ain't changed 
Thuggin em well, slingin em things 
Fools rock Rolies and diamond rings 
Respect the game, our hood's the same 

[CHORUS]
