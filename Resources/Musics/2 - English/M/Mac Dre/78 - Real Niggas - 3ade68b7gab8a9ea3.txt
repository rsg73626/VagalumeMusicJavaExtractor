REAL NIGGAS

[Chorus: Mac Dre] 
I'd rather die like a man then live my life like a bitch 
I'd rather be in the pen then live my life like a snitch 
Playa population is decreasing by millions 
So I dedicate this to all the real ones 
Real niggas, real niggas 
Real niggas, real niggas 

[Verse One] 
I got three rules when I hustle and ain't anyone funny 
It's like get yo money, get yo money, and oh yeah get yo money 
Can't be no punk and damn sure can't be no hoe 
I'm like the Grand National, they don't make them like me no mo' 
Doper than a joint of that sticky gooey 
Hella saucy potna, real ragooey 
I pops extra hard cause I know talk is cheap 
Tell a hoe toss it in the air, whatever I say she peeps 
See I'm about my cheese, I want G's, y'all fucked 
Down and dirty low to the ground like frog nuts 
Keep a hoe bottom lip hanging like a turtle neck sweater 
Love a freaky lesbian who can give bomb headers 
See my dick stay hard like a cave mans chisel 
Waiting for a super bad to come wet my whistle 
But my ???? in life is to gain cash 
And that there is more serious than a plane crash 

Real niggas, real niggas 
Real niggas, real niggas 

[Chorus x1] 

[Verse Two] 
I'm on the mic representing that players committee 
Letting ya know that some of these niggas need a pair of tities 
Never had a player hater born in my body, never been jealous 
Just stubborn hard headed and hella rebelious 
Fly like Denzel, smooth like Billy Dean 
Some ain't feelin' me cause they can't really see 
I'm saucy cause I stay dipped hoe 
And still hit the scene, and scream what they hit fo' 
Steady havin' cash cause I'm down to take a dollar 
Quickly pop my collar, and tell that bitch a holler 
It really ain't hard it's just this pimpin and this tongue 
That get them bitches sprung, and make them wanna run 
And when I say run I mean perform it to the utmost 
Other niggas trip with they dick and wanna fuck hoes 
Pimpin's outdated is what them suckas said 
But the pimpin ain't dead its just the hoes they mislead 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Three] 
I got the heart of a gangster, mind of a business man, 
tongue of a pimp, 
Stupid dumb all dollars no sense 
Stay perkin', used to be off that yac 
Now I'm on that gorilla milk or that Yukon Jack 
Double R star, three c general 
Fortified with this game like vitamins and minerals 
Doper than a bottle of that dog food 
Yall thought I was stupid, now look how I'm comin' at yall fools 
Sportin' one fifties used to fuck with pumas 
Now I'm havin more money than Brinks and Lunars 
Maurice Malone, Mark Buchannon, and Enyce 
Cashin' fat checks weekly 
Beep me, if you tryin' to et churped at 
No paper you'll get cut like Elvis Grbac (I heard that) 
Punk bitch get stomped out 
Triple see ya, Mac Dre, romped out 

[Chorus]
