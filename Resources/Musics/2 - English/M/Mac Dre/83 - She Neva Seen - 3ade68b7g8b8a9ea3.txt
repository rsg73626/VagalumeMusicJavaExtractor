SHE NEVA SEEN

[Verse 1] 
It was a hot night in August, (hot August night), humid 
Hit the store to get some O.J. to shroom with 
Ooh shitty, I'm in the world's biggest little city 
Seen a girl with some big ass titties 
Top notch sadditty, punk bitch knew she was pretty 
Get goosed in the city, get your purse took 
When I stepped in her life she felt the earth shook 
Before I spit the first hook, let me lace ya 
Fucked her, had her crying like somebody maced her 
Gave her a taste of some real macaroni 
She swore she would do, anything for me 
That's no bologne, baby brought me bread 
Freaked me on the freeway on the 80 gave me head 
She neva seen, a savage in Tims 
Push a S5 sittin' on some Davin rims 

[Beat Bridge] 

[Verse 2] 
Listen, you wouldn't want to miss this 
I met this bitch the night before Christmas 
Baby made my hitlist Christmas night 
She let a nigga hit by Christmas lights 
This bitch was tight, just my type 
Barely right ride a dick like a bike 
Eat a dick like pipe quick late night hype 
Them the kind of thangs that makes my night 
The steak ain't right without the A-1 
So I stay dipped in sauce and they come 
Like baby did, like that nigga old lady did 
Like Karen, Kameka, and Katie did 
It's crazy kid 
Mommy on my bozac, I'm pimpin and she knows that, nigga wher the hoes at 
Bet she neva seen, a sav in Tims 
Push a S5 sittin' on some Davin rims 

[Beat Bridge] 

[Verse 3] 
Me and black jesus went to Rosaritas 
Seen senoritas eating carnitas 
I was rocking my adidas sneakers 
Told the waitress give my fajitas 
Gold teethas, never speechless 
Gave me the number with a Fairfield prefix 
Dipped to the cougar, put up the ruger 
In the stash spot, a wise maneuver 
Put up the cougar, pulled out the MB 
California Hot Boy, MD 
The boss, that do the firing and hiring 
Sweat a broad, I keep them prespiring 
She's admiring the way I slide 
The way I ride, and her boyfriend lied 
She neva seen a sav in Tims 
Push a S5 sittin' on some Davin rims 

[Ending Chorus x2] 
She only see's me with European keys 
She only see's me with woodgrain sprees 
She only see's me with Champelli trees 
She only see's me having hella G's
