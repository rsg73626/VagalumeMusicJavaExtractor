EARLY RETIREMENT

[Verse 1] 
I'm doper than a Bobby Brown piss test 
Bitches blow me till they ain't got no spit left 
Do it movin' cause slow niggaz get left 
Get left and miss the game like a sick ref 
A quick left and a overhand right 
A fat .44, some doja and a mic 
Are my weapons, of mass destruction 
And detectives know not to ask me nothin' 
I'm silent, I might speak to garlic 
Drink dirty martinis with the Spanish olive 
Garlic and cheese on my french bread 
Swallow it please when I get head 
I'm pimp fed, girls feed me well 
Never would they let the world see me fail 
They bring me mail, like I'm a mailbox 
A pimp with no gators, Air Force and Shell Tops

[Verse 2] 
Back in the day I used to need the knots 
Posted at the spot I used to bleed the block 
Servin' weed and rocks often even hop 
Never leavin' the spot, wouldn't even leave for cot 
If I needed some cot I made hutch come through 
Go deep when she bend over, hut 1-2 
What you wan do with rude boy like me 
Quick to come through with crew so hyphy 
If she don't like me she must be a lesbo 
I get it nightly, man that's my schedule 
Dre Bledsoe, I'm the quarterback 
Whatever cost the most, I'm a order that 
Across the border strapped my essas 
Come through with fluff from Peru 
I come from a crew 
Of cutthoats, bank robbers, and dope dealers 
It's business with us nigga get out yo feelin's 
Get out yo scrillin's, live like a king 
Take the top off the Heem, pop you a thing 
I don't buss them in half, it leave a nasty taste 
I swallow them hole, and get the Thizz face 
It's laced, with nothin' but game 
I steal them from niggaz, that be cuffin' they dame 
I'm fuckin' his main, while he gettin' his grind on 
Get bossed, get costed, get paid than I'm gone 
My tone, is loud sometimes 
I scream at a bitch, like she a crowd sometimes 
Tell her a thousand times, hoe goe make it happen 
It consequences, if she don't make it happen 
I'm trying to find them bitches, that's dough paper havin' 
Only into one thing that's more paper havin' 
You no paper havin', niggaz is bootsy 
All at the function in that Chinamen Gucci 
Tryin' to coochie, you wine and dine chicks 
Goin' for it, fallin' for mind tricks 
I tryin' to find chicks, that know the requirements 
And works towards a pimp's early retirement
