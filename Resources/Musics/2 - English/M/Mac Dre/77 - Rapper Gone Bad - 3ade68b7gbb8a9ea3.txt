RAPPER GONE BAD

[VERSE 1] 
I'm a young gifted and black mack, rap sweet like candy yams 
And I make you put your fist up to your mouth and say, "Goddamn!" 
Boy, I got heat, flame-o, pull a mic, liquid draino 
Verbal volcano, they love me, cause they know 
I'm cut from the cloth that real men are made of 
Bitches get sprayed up with clips of this Bay love 
Attackin you with vernacular, dialect and lingo 
The Rapper Gone Bad, boy, peep the first single 
Bounce and shake what your mammy gave you 
It's the drapers, can you feel it? Nothin can save you 
>From the dapper rapper who stay fitted like a mannequin 
Hoes see me in the traffic and say, "Girl, there go that man again" 
I'm fabulicious, game nutricious 
Break bitches like dishes and drink like them fishes 
Boy, put some of that yukon jack in the bag 
And come fuck with yo partner, the rapper gone bad 

(Rapper gone bad) 
(Ra-ra-ra-ra-rap) 
(Baaad) 

[VERSE 2] 
I'm a old schooler like Grandmaster and the 5 that was Furious 
Bitches goin delirious even though it ain't that serious 
You're curious? Well, listen to these lyricals 
Them suckers tryin to knock this, it's gonna take a miracle 
I'm seasoned with the game that o.g.'s told me 
Got laced like Luke did by Obi Won Kenobi 
Or Yoda, hold a, mic in my right hand 
And when I'm sleep you know I keep a fat strap in my nightstand 
I strike men, my height, man, is l-o-double d 
I see us after the show at the hotel Double Tree 
Cool, calm and collected, but sometimes I get mean 
Cause suckers sick of the scene like they Jack and i'm the Green 
Giant, defiant, bitches get dealt with quick 
Can't be on this ball team unless you wanna help get grits 
Let's get rich, is what I tell em, sell em dreams like horoscopes 
They try to fight the feeling, but it's hard to ignore your folks 
Mac D with the r connected to the e (me) 
Might be at the bar drinkin Hennessy 
In between the sheets I'm a freak and a cold piece of work 
My puddy over her body like Johnny, Keith and Levert 

(Rapper gone bad) 
(Ra-ra-ra-ra-rap) 
(Baaad) 

[VERSE 3] 
A thug like 2pac, wanna mack like Too  
Smoke punks like Newports, get drunk off 2 quarts 
Bendin corners in somethin ninety-new 
Lookin real ragoon on my way to see Chuey 
Boy, I'm on the air gettin heavy rotation 
But I'm still a player with a Chevy on Daytons 
I'm hi-po, and the five-o really can't stand me 
Got posse, Flowmasters and Shift, King and Tranny 
Chirpin every time I shift gears 
In that '95 Impala with them gold-dipped gears 
Put some of that 151 in the bag 
Come fuck with yo partner, the rapper gone bad 

(Rapper gone bad) 
(Ra-ra-ra-ra-rap)
