YOUNG BLACK BROTHA

Young black brotha can never be a lover
He keeps a joint in one hand and heem in the other
So fly you never see him buming
He's never had a job and keeps a pocket full of money
Live low daytons and vogues
A beeper on his belt and a gang of hos
Been in and out of jail sense the day he was ten
The hall, the county, and next is the pen
See really doesn't know what the games about
Get in stack a bank and get the fuck out
Because a D-boys life is cool at first
But in the end it's the pen or even wares a hearst
Young brotha loves to get keyed
Cuz he feels so good when he's hitin' the weed
He's never been ta high school let alone college
Now so much game and to much knowledge
Some call him a sad case but who do that figga 
Many wanna be like that young nigga
And its not just him it's a nuther and a nether
Cuz many of us live the liiffee of a young black bruutthhaaa

Hes a young black bruutthhaaa

18 years on this earth and Oakland is my place of berth
And now the big CREST SIDE! is where I stay
Va-lay-ho
Cal-i-fron-ie-ay
Mob shots
Drop tops
Bass cocaine and corked cops
Niggas grinden to stak a bank 
And ta flip a fresh lode with the candy pant
Some fail and some succeed
Some seal coke and some seal weed
Some pimp hos
And some strate gank Any damn thang to stack that bank
Young black brotha he's a bisnis man
Tryin to make money any way he can
Clockin hos Rollin voges Smokin the weed that's how it gos
Young black brotha hes doin it man
Getin at a ho with a brew in his hand
He gets the number and then he burns rubber
Cuz he's livin the liiffee of a young black bruutthhaaa

He's a young black bruutthhaaa

Khayree brake it down for me one time

Hos jock they throw the cock
At a young black brotha rosin to tha top
Material strolla pushin' 1$ snakes
And daytons and voges is all it takes
For a young black brotha ta fill her like ?furrow?
And straight thrust and finde him a new ho
Be a Mac nigga a straight Mac nigga
And kick back and let the bank get bigger
Find a million doller spot but don't get hot
Cuz you'll feel so dumb when you got popped
Peep game and let the shit soak man
Don't be a nuther little dope man
Get in where you fit in if you don't then squeeze
Stack Gs will you please
I'm Mac dre baby the young black brotha
The young nigga on tha album cover
From the bay boy
Mac dre boy
The mutherfucking Mac ass play boy
Mackin dope rhymes anouther and anouther
Cuz I'm livin the liiffee of a young black bruutthhaaa

Hes a young black brotha
