Listen up I'm about to get doper 
They call me Mr. Furly but I'm more like Mr. Roper 
Roper smoker 
No so fuck a chauffeur 
I use my own bow so I can toke the super soaker 
Use the post up on the block with my toaster 
Now I eat MC's like frozen food from Stouffers 
Most these dudes is jokers 
Hopeless no focus (no focus] 
Underground like gofers 
Gettin' stocked like drawers 
Hocus Pocus

You can put the whistle on a 7-7 Maverick (7-7 Maverick) 
Nigga pack a pistol when he ain't scared to blast it (ain't scared to blast it) 
Nigga it's official you can catch me in the traffic (in the traffic) 
In the Benz on them rims that spin (that spin) 
Checkin' chins, fuck friends, stack ends (stack ends) 
It's Mac and I'm back and I'm smackin' (Thizz!) 
This be the slap and get yo hands clappin' 

[Chorus x2]

Tell you what I'm gon' do (gon' do) 
Grab a juice and pop two (pop two) 
Then act a mutha fuckin' fool

[Mac Dre] 
I'm a pimp and a playa 
My diamonds gleam (bling, bling) 
I'm a Giant, a Raider, boy I'm a King (I'm a King) 
Totin' the cater under my wing [under my wing] 
I'm dumb and don't care nigga what you mean (what you mean) 
Pass the heam 
Thizz, weed, so I can get started (so I canget started) 
Dre that is me 
I can get retarded [I can get retarded] 
I can get the party crackin' when it's yawnin' (it's yawnin') 
And the bitches won't leave 'til six in the mornin' 
If you condonin' that bullshit, stop it (stop it) 
'fo I unlock it, cock it, and cop it (cop it)
