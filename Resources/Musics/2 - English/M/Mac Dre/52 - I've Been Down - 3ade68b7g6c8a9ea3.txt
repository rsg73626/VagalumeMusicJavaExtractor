I'VE BEEN DOWN

[feat. Harm) 

Real niggas 
(Let's make this official, baby) 
Real before rappin 
Respect before success 

[Harm] 
I've been down 
For oh so long 
Starin at these prison walls 

I want you to... 
Step in my 150s for a minute 
Step in my shoes 
Walk in my shoes 
Yeah 
Just want you to see things like how I see em 
You know 
This's for all my niggas out there 
Check it out 

Bottom bunk, sleepin in a 2 man cell 
C.O. at my do', and I'm mad as hell 
Punk police cowboy from Texas 
Talkin some shit bout servin breakfast 
It's 5:15, he must be psycho 
Or just plain stupid for thinkin I might go 
I cussed him out, he gave me distance 
And pressed his body alarm for quick assistance 
Now these muthafuckas wanna do it the rough way 
Five C.O.'s is what it takes to cuff Dre 
Straight to the hole, but it ain't no thang 
My celly got dank, so I'm Kool & The Gang 
See the lt. for the disposition 
28 days commissary restriction 
2 days later back on the main line 
Dopefiend's dose, so I go claim mine 
25 cartons, now I'm straight 
Keep 17, and the homeboys 8 
Cop some hop, start back boomin 
Got em sendin money on the Western Union 
2 fat gramms of that china white 
Gon' have these dopefiends tryin to fight 
Grabbed 3 cartons to coop some dank 
And 5 whole packs for some hoops to drink 
Now I'm chillin in my cell lookin out the window 
Drinkin pruno, smokin indo 
Grabbed my shank, but when I'm finsta bounce 
They lock a nigga down for resistance counts 
Look at Jack Brooks while I'm waitin 
Might even do a little masturbatin 
Trippin off that bitch Dominique 
I bust one quick while my celly sleep 
Doors rack open, now it's time for movement 
Goddamn pruno got a nigga too bent 
Bounce to the movies with my homies 
The title sound good, but the shit was phoney 
Damn cigarettes won't let me breathe 
Niggas gettin restless, wantin to leave 
The lights flash on, quick as fuck 
Somebody in the bathroom just got stuck 
If he makes it, he'll be lucky 
Six inch blade stuck straight in gutry 
25 cops rush the spot 
Now I got one-time on my jock 
Stash my shank underneath the seat 
And make sure no blood is on my feet 
Punk police wanna take me down 
They put me on the wall and they shake me down 
Now it's back to the block strapless 
But I got two mo' in my matress 
One mo' time I peep the cops 
Fuckin with them boys from Great Street, Watts 
I said, "Punk muthafucka, won't you leave em the hell alone" 
Down to the 3rd and got on the telephone 
Called my bitch, but she showed me no love 
Got on the phone, shot me a cold dove 
She said she can't talk, she got a sore throat 
But she probably gettin fucked by a sport coat 
I'm goin through it 

Yeah 
Y'all real niggas know 

Yeah muthafucka 
I done been there and back boy 
I could tell you the story from rags to riches 
How I did time with fags and snitches 
That's real 
It's really real 
It's no drama 
It's really real 
Yeah 
Y'all niggas better go to school 
Tryina fuck with this nigga here, man 
It's the real 
Yeah 
Dick Down 
Freaky D 
Baby Rah 
T-Endo 
My niggas 
Ty-Ty 
Doin that federal shit 

Freak 
Freak, don't worry about nothin, man 

I've been down 
For oh so long 
Starin at these prison walls 
Same old song
