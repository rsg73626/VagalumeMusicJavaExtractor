CUTTHOAT SOUP

[Beat changes after each verse] 

[Verse 1] 
Uh 
I'm always late, always on my way 
Ain't enough hours in the day to be Dre 
Cause in the bay, things move fast 
Stop to catch a breath, you might get past 
And that's yo ass, cause I'ma do it movin' 
At 12 o' clock I'm supposed to meet Rubin 
But I forgot, Ubin gotta wait 
Cause I can't be late for me court date 
For goodness sake I'm like what the fuck 
I'm noddin' out, I'm sleep standin' up 
If I don't go sit my black ass down 
I'ma fuck around and, fall down 
What the feezy who tryin' to call now 
Oh I forgot, I'm supposed to be at the mall now 
I got in-sto', if they knew what they was in fo' 
24 hours in a day I need ten mo' 

Had to make sure it was cool baby, the call from up top 
Is it, is it cool? 

[Verse 2] 
I'm a federal hoe nigga do shit that's unavailable 
Do it cutthoatish, unnoticed, untrailable 
My bitch gon' make sure the funds are available 
I'm a hot commidity, big business, I'm sellable 
Infuckincredible, ineditble 
I'm married to the game so that makes unweddable 
No wedding, no romantic setting 
I matress on the floor, no fancy bedding 
Get it straight from the gate so you know where this thang is heading 
Colder as the snow on the mountains of Redding 
Everythang she wanna do, I'm not letting 
Work a race horse til her hair start shedding 
I'm not regretting, the dirt I've done 
A nigga wanna wet me I'ma squirt my gun 
I need weed that's gon' hurt my lung 
And chick with jaw that'll make me squirt my cum 

[Verse 3] 
I'm sorry to hear your situation has been worsening 
Oh I can't complain, me myself personally 
Tramp traffic is at all time high 
I'm still stuntastic like I've been all my life 
And how about wife, she's been hittin' me dog 
I think she's considering gettin' me dog 
She no longer cherish your marriage cause you financially embarrassed 
Man I can take the bitch and go get mo' chips than Harris 
No day off like Farris, service is volunteer 
By choice not force, it won't be no problems here 
Man withgaurd she finna do somethin' slick 
If she ain't ridin' mine she gon' be ridin' somebody else dick 
Cause she tired of ya, done made a lie of ya 
Pass her to a pimp, let me show you how I does her 
I'ma get it out of her, every penny, every dolla 
It's rent money, yanadadaholla 

[Verse 4] 
You lames missed it, got twisted like a pretzel 
I'm a slick nigga cunning, gunning, running from the metro 
I get so quick do it movin' bitch I'm federal 
Respect it, connected get the stuff from the esa Pedro 
I'm a pimp you, but you wouldn't know I dress retro 
Breathe life in a hoe lung, get her sprung she can't let go 
Should've bet mo', scary nigga I'm winner 
Eat a nigga for dinner, game strong as paint thinner 
If I can't sinner, than pimpin', I don't need her 
All I need is one mic, my money, and my heater 
I steal clientele, short stop like Derek Jeter 
I'm ill for my mail will hop out the two-seater 
My mouth is too heated, I'm outlawed in a few states 
I come through in somethin' ooh, cleaner than you with new plates 
Y'all niggaz is fruit cakes, same sex marriages 
I'm cutthoat with cutthettes, strapped with daringers 

[Verse 5] 
Yep, you right, nigga how you know 
Man pimpin' had to let that bitch go 
She a dyme, tryin' to steal my shine 
Told that bitch take a number, get yo ass back in line 
You wastin' my muthafuckin' time 
I'm the biggest thang since Sprite put lemon with lime 
Have you lost yo muthafuckin' mind 
You must don't know, bitch I'm the kind 

[Verse 6] 
(Man it's cold) 
It's cold as the Swiss Alps 
People get on me, than homie I switch routes 
Mac Dre stay cussin' a bitch out 
Quarterbackin', like Dan Thoutes or Tim Crouch 
I'm stuntin', watchin' my scritch scrotch 
Pourin' some Cris, potna I'm pimped out 
I'm colder than a blizzard in Alaska 
Or Mt. Shasta, In a mask a blast ya 
My car faster, I strike past ya 
12 Volt posi, cam and flowmasters 
Keep it to yo'self potna, who asked ya 
I teach the game, a preach but no pastor 
I'm cold
