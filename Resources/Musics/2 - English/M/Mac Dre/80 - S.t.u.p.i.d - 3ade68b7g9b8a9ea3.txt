S.T.U.P.I.D

[verse 1] 

When we pull up to the light the people all stare 
four niggas in a benz with the dreadlock hair 
smoke everywhere 
wavein at mavericks 
in the woodgrain davens with the liscence plate rattlein 
doin what we want to hangin out the sun roof 
we mental, we ignorant, boy we go dumb to 
gas-break-dip, we call it yokein, do a doughnut in yo whip 
we call it ghostin 
get stupid thats what we do good ghost ride the whip 
while im dancin on the hood, im amped feelin good... 
im hiphy, thizz face with the thizz face off of nike 
the women like me im dipped in butter 
i'll rob ya brother pimp the blood out ya mother 
im mr. stupid-doo-doo dumb, somethin terrible tell em how we come...

S.T.U.P.I.D when we come to the club we dont need i.d 
everywhere we go its a party yall we gon' get it crackin like the mardi gras 

[verse 2]
