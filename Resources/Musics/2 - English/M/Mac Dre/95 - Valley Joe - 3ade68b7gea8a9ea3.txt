VALLEY JOE

[Lil Bruce] 

They say pimpin' aint easy 
And nigga, they aint neva lie 
We ride back to back thru the track faul on suicide 
Watch me glide on twenties 
Get money 
Smokin' backwoods on pills 
Breakin' bitches that will 
Cause its pimpin' 
Only special women 
Livin' up and down the blocks slangin' rocks slangin' cock 
Pimp til I die 
Im so fly 
Thats where I am and thats where Im not 
Im Lil Bruce baby, I come from the V 
The home of iternaroles but MD 

[PSD] 

You think I can about schan or snatch 
And Im runnin' scams to get my hands on scratch 
Understand that 
Woman romance without financeamie 
Stands no chance with my man of my pedigree 
Call my hoggish if you would 
Shoulda been a part of Sick Wid It Records 
Wit a pig on my necklace 
What ya dig my possesions is the gaz my gift 
Why should it matter if its turf shit werent for shit 
Nigga we hurt shit 
That is rebirth wit it 
Thats what it the gaz shit 
Man we curse wit it 
As for us we did it 
So nigga name it I done it 
And love to hit it while she on her stomach 
Money and hundreds 

[Chorus] 

Im from the V-A double L E-J-O 
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know 
Im from the valley with sally silly dank biiitch 
What it is what it is what it is 

[B-Legit] 

A boss up 
Never fuck its red lights with a toss up 
A tangle where we crossed up 
Its big shit 
V town affiliates 
Just watch us rip shit 
The ganster or the pimp shit 
No simp shit 
Bitch I must I mean 
Out the ricks 
Wit kicks 
And gun machines 
You know the green 
The thing we was dieing to get 
Its a reason why my niggas came so damn sick 
When I represent 
Bitch I put it on dubbs 
Park it by the club and let the rat heads rub 
Im out to get the cheddar 
If she fight 
Nigga let her 
It dont matter 
I stay fatter 

[Mac Dre] 

It dont matter 
As long as my pockets get fatter 
I dont give a fuck if savilians got scatter 
Im the last batter 
Better hit a homerun 
When I stick my dick in I watch how fast she cum 
Up the block sideways when I shift I turnt quick 
And after that first dick 
Im all in your purse bitch 
Mac Drizae 
Off the hizzae 
Goin' off hennihizae 
And a half of thizel (thizel) 
Romper Roomin' 
No cartoonin' 
Makin' it scrill 
Keepin' it real 
Bitch the mill 

[Chorus] 
[x4]
