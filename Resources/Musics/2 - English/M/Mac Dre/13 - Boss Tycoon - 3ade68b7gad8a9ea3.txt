BOSS TYCOON

(feat. Yukmouth) 

[Mac Dre] 
Uh, what 
Nigga what....let's do it, (nigga what) 
Nigga what....Like that 

[Verse 1: Mac Dre] 
I know, doe ray me 
But no I'm not a R&B sanger 
I'm a gangter rapper throwin' the middle fanger 
To them square rubix cubes, who don't smoke and use 
I'm a cutthoat boy and I got a short fuse 
I get kind of hyphy when I'm gone off a little Gin 
You don't like it, say hello to my little friend 
Rat-ta-tat-tatta, it really don't matter 
I push a hard line cross it, niggaz gon' scatter 
I'm not the mad rapper, I'm the rapper gon' bad 
Recordin' on Pro-Tools at the pad 
I give the game a bath, boy I'm a sav 
Come through the sideshow yokin' the Cad 

[Chorus x2] 
Fuck what it cost (what it cost) 
I'm a boss (I'm a boss), Tycoon (ty-tycoon) 
Dipped in sauce (in sauce), I floss (I floss) 
I coon (I-I coon) 

[Verse 2: Yukmouth] 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
What you know about a, 600 V12 
CL's spinnin' on them Spreewells, dirty as hell 
Like fuck a detail, still knock yo female 
Mack that bitch til' she break her Lee nails 
On the track in TL, Yukmouth 
First week out 80 thousand on the street sales 
Now I'm CEO that's seven dollars on the retail, bitch 
I got niggaz poppin' they collars, poppin' E pills 
Poppin' them bottles, to poppin' them cowards with that heatelle 
And fuck Spitz, I get my ice from Vionnis 
My new york italianni, he plug me with Spanish mamis 
Bitches belly dancin' like a swami, but fuck em' 
I'm too cocky, poppin' that Don P., smokin' my broccoli 
Cause I'm a million dollar man like Ted Dediase 
The FEDz see me, watch me, baby Liberace 
The wrist stay rocky, the whips stay saucy, rims glossy 
With mackin' as Dre beside me 
Call me frosty, frosty the snowman, the Oakland dopeman 
Sell more kicks than Copeland's, bitch 
The Oakland mayor, the Oakland Raider 
With the king of Vallejo, bitch, Foldin' paper 
Tycoon 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Mac Dre] 
I ride around town in my clean ass Benz 
Range Rov, coughnut on some clean ass rims 
Hot like Ted Turner, I pack the lead burner 
Spit it, to get it, can't quit it I'm a bread earner (ch-ching) 
Post up at the 5-star telly, Dre touch mo' bread 
Than a motherfuckin' deli 
Young rich nigga, 20 inch nigga, P-I-M-P 
It's all on a bitch nigga 
I've been gettin' scrill, diamonds in my grill 
Rep the pill, and boy do I keep it trill 
Showoff, that'll go off on a blade 
Kill like Raid and stay gon' off made 
Do what the fuck wanna, got bitches on the corner 
Not just a thizz user, I'm a thizz owner 
Sometimes I thizz, sometimes I shroom 
But whatever I do, I'ma stay a Tycoon 

[Chorus]
