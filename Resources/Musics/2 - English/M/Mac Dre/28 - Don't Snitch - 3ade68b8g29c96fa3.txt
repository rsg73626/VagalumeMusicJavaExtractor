DON'T SNITCH

[verse 1:]
Man im threw fuckin around
You niggas keep on u gon be duckin sum rounds,
I rush the mound, bitch hit me wit a pitch he a, he a snitch n he walk wit a switch.
He in a band that sing for the cops,
Him and his mans they cleanin up shop,
Undercover, conture promoter, rick shroter tryin to turn sombody over,
Put that et finger up, eat stulee, don't tattle tale the number one rulee
You the jumpers the boys the people
Slipped in the game sellin toys to people i avoid people don't ask me shit, the only law i break is the public grip
My mouth zipped i plead the fifth and niggaz like you get pushed off a cliff.

[chrous:]
Don't ask me shit

U can send me to jail man
Send me to jail

[verse 2:]
Im on to u boy, U used to be the man
Til i crossed u n the court room sittin on the stand, got to waivin ya hand n pointin ya finger
All n the mike like sum kind of rap singa
I seen u, u told, n now u got to live wit big ol bitch u prolli said bigs did it
Fuck you, fuck wut u gettin to, fuck wut u goin threw, n fuck wit u went threw
Consider this a warning to u case out rapping, the streets get ugly when the drop out happen,
You rap niggas out here starvin for fame, and ya'll niggas act like its all n a game,
Cuz niggas n the streets wanna blast this bitch, n when it happen dun ask me shit

[chrous x4]

[verse 3:]
U can line em up n put 12 n a box n find out ya boy workin wit the cops,
Doing flipflops, the roller, rolling over, For the tootsie roller, scanned to do it flower
Its october we can't be gon til november
So we givin up the game everre damn winter
And everrethang he remember he telling
He get out of jail free

He's not felon, he's no mr needy
He got a target melon and an et finger
Nigga u the cleaners, tryin to watch me
Quick peepin at muh beemer
Tryin to watch me
