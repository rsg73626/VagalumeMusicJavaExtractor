BACK 2 DA BASICS

[Chorus: x4] 
[Back 2 Da Basics Overlaps the Chorus] 
Doing The Same Ol Thang 

[Da Unda Dogg] 
Back 2 Da Basics where I wont sale yak 
see I got get back mothafuck the jacks 
strapped me a gat just in case of the rap pack 
I got another five to survive 
my boss keep sweatin' me workin' me fo days 
shit can a nigga get a raise 
man I got a child to support and this ain't workin' 
can't pop yay cuz the police is lerkin' 
it's gettin to point where I'm bout to say fuck it 
jackin' muthafuckas in a bucket 
can't I be back where I started straight cold hearted 
my family would look at me retarded disregarded 
because I must get risk legit 
a couple Benz and a kit and they can't do shit 
see they got theirs, and y'alls got y'alls 
and now its time to get mine and plus I got balls 
boss fo a sec as nigga run a check on this microphone 
to see if its on 

[Chorus] 

I called a few friends 
and see if they could front me some ends 
they all talking about it depends 
what you need it fo, now ain't that strange 
how money make a muthafucka change 
and I bout had it with this job choppin down woods 
while my homies choppin ki's in the hood 
livin' good, and I can't stand one mo case 
because the judge would throw the fuckin book in my face 
that's why everybody is willin' to die 
to get a fat piece of the pie 
im coming up dry, my pockets is chapped 
im thinking about pimpin' the hoods up with the gat 
silly of me how dumb could I be 
its time to make a call to the homie MD 
can a nigga get plugged, I heard you got juice 
and I got a few I'll like to produce 
don't sweat the style cuz I got flow 
that why I called yo ass to let you know 

[Chorus] 

Now everythings fine no more grime 
the feds can't stick me with no more time 
i told my boss that he could kiss my black ass 
cuz being on this team, the longer its gone last 
i made my rounds threw the jordans down 
and off to the crest hittin' zest by the pounds 
no more settin' trippin unless you want to trip 
wit my zest hit yo ass like a Vietnam vet 
I bet I'll go far if I could be a star 
eatting chitlings and ham and I could give a damn 
bout Uncle Sam because my army's getting paid 
hittin' with the lyrics they know they can't fade 
so I stop scheming up a mission to plot 
avoiding three huints and a cop 
I got to give a shoot fo my homies in the pin 
cuz without yo help I'll never get in' 
gave a in' to my mom and I drop the bombs 
like the homeboy rhomes 
Im Back 2 Da Basics 

[Chorus] 

Doin Doin the same ol thing huh 
Doin the same old thing
