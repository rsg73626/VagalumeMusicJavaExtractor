SINCE '84

[Mac Dre Talking] 
C'mon 
Let's do it 
What it is 
Thizz is what it is 
unh yea 
Another Knocker 
Kick This game around like soccer 

[Verse 1] 
Pull up a chair let me make you a plate 
Of this game tha's seasoned like a tasty steak 
Since '88 I've been serving them well 
I was serving yell when L was rocking bells 
Clocking mail get get getting it 
Copping it flip flip flipping it 
Now I'm spitting it bar for bar 
European whipping it car for car 
No doe hoe? You know I say no 
I need you like jaws need a rain coat 
I put dangles stay high as the star spangled 
Choke the blood out you bitch get strangled 
Get mangled fucking with this pimping 
Hot as Lipton Dre Jay Trimpson 
You better pay attention it's all gamed up 
Peep the bio the file see how I came up 

[Hook] 
Since '84 I been out there gettin my doe 
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo 
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo 
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin hoes 
Rolling on vogues and Two Fours 
Dre trippa got to stay with two hoes 
Stay with zippas boy I keep a few O's 
Get bossed and say dog she blows 

[Verse 2] 
When I sweat her I say read my lips 
Bring me cheddar bitch bring me chips 
Finger tips ass hips and lips 
Folow my lead dont ask questions bitch 
I want fresh fits from Abecrombe & Fitch 
When it's going down the Mac comes and shits 
The Mac comes to spit 
Let me do it to your ear baby 
I'm trying to flip see I do it every year baby 
Real off the laddish 
Getting my cottage 
Cheese geez please beez freeze 
Stop it your heading down the wrong path 
Fuck making bitch I want a tongue bath 
Dumb cash can you do it like me? 
Cash a fat check at the bank with no I.D. 
Can you blow by me when I'm doing 100? 
Smacking slapping in my 500

[Verse 3] 
I got cutthroat friends and lots of women 
I ride in a Benz but i'll squat a lemon 
I want a stuff turkey with all the trimmings 
To pay and play extra innings 
I'm winning fat lady start singing 
I'm finna get the cougnut and start swinging 
Skeet dance and eight 
And when they run my plates model and make 
I'ma shake like I'm riding with a K 
Pedal to the medal rarely hit the brake 
I love a high speed get away 
They wanna get rid of Dre 
Put the kid away 
But I'm in the day I'm in the 7 series 
So quiet you can't even hear the 
Engine when I smash the gas 
And would you look at all the wood on the dash
