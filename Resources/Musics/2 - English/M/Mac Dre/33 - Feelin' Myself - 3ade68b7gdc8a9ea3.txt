FEELIN' MYSELF

I'm out of this world, not your run of the mill'n 
My name is fur I'm the owner of the building 
I'm a stoner and I'm chillin with two bitches like Jack 
I pimps and I mac drive a Benz and a 'lac 
man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars 
I've been out front with the thugs in the cars 
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia 
And I only run with niggaz that'll kill and die for ya 
I'm popular, I'm a rap star 
but I live like a rock star running from the cop cars 
I drop bars wit slaps that Knock hard and I charge with this dick extra large 
I'm sick of these whores higher than mars and I treat my bitch like an ATM card 

[Chorus: x4] 
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself 
Man I'm feelin myself 

She's in the buildin and she's feelin herself 
She's lookin bad man I'm willing to help 
Stop it baby your killin yourself 
come on I got your back you could chill in my 
I'm feelin myself too 
Man imagine some of the things we can do 
You under me 
Me under you 
Then we can catch the Liquor store before 2:00 
We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms 
And if you still want to kick it then we can go get a room 
It won't cost you much 
I'm a good guy 
Dick-on-discount bitch good bye 
What do I look like mr. Frank Fuck for Free 
No Dope Hoe you can't fuck with me 
get the fuck out 
Bitch you still on my dick 
You full of shit and I'm feelin myself 

[Chorus] 

I'm a Westcoast Bad Boy 
I represent it 
wait that's a bad tune is it rented 
hardy har har very funny 
You don't hear my tummy 
I gets my money 
My stomache ain't growlin 
I'm stylin and wylin drink Vodka straight Fuck the Long Island 
I want my own Island bet you I'm a get it 
I switch hit and play with both mits 
I pack a 45th Im after your bitch 
he ain't doing it right shes after your scritch 
And I'm after hers with these macing words nerd 
I thawed squares stage shark 
Your nothing but a mark in a fuckin Sky Lark 
I'm playing my part 
I'm mr. Furly 
Put in the rum and I'm talkin to your gurly 

[Chorus]
