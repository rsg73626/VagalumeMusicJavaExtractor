MAC STABBER

Un-fuckin-believable 
Mac stabbas 
Smile in your face 
Stab you in the back 
Mac stabbas 
It's time to pull the sheets off these niggas main 
You heard? 

I done heard you tape Mac 
That shit is wack 
Why the fuck you sellin' that? 
You need to go back to sellin' crack 
Take it from a nigga that been from hell and back 
Oh yeah, I forgot 
You ain't sold a god damn crumb 
You's a studio gangsta chump 
Where the fuck you from? 
No love for the niggas that done laced your muthafukin' boots 
Niggas that slave went to the grave for ya 
Niggas that ain't scared to shoot 
Giligan ass nigga I remeber I was makin' your promos 
Now you want to diss your real folks and chop it up with these homos 
Like that nigga Khayree you let that sissy cross game 
Sock me up usin' your name 
Guess it's just a hoe thang 
Y'all niggas killin' me 
With all that gay shit 
All y'all niggas came up 
Fuck that Mac Dre shit 
Mark Mall you need to be fucked up the booty hole 
Knowin' the first time you touched the mic it was in my studio 
You niggas must have forgot before I was bustin' raps and rhymes 
I was on the track with a sack sippin yack strapped with a gat and a nine 
I've been to your house 
I've seen your chrome 
But you ain't gone bust a grape in Napa valley with golf shoes on 
A bitch made nigga gets no love from a real G 
Cutties from the 3 C's I know you feel me 
I should have known when I came home somethin was wrong 
Yo own crew tried to have your dome 
And just left that shit alone 
Now you wanna fuck with a cut throat nigga that been doin dirt 
Since creased 5-0-1's, Chuck Taylors and them Izod shirts 
Them 5-trey-5 niggas don't like you 
Don't believe it how come Yo Jaguar slide through 
You'll be lucky to leave the ghetto with just a leakin lip 
You feelin focus I'm feelin hogish boy we can slip 
In granny back yard 
Then when you act hard 
I'm a treat you like a Mac Bitch 
Young Mac Mark 
Young Black Brothas Records is a goddamn flop 
Khayree needed to stop 
Way back when his ass got dropped 
From that major label 
That nigga had a major stable 
But he shot himself in the head boy 
Blow was fatal 
God don't like that man 
Boy ask yo mamma 
Now everywhere you travel you best to have bussalami 
Mac Mall gets no love ask my nigga Dubee 
He shook us for videos and pretty hoes and went him out his movie 
That nigga left me for dead when I was doin' time in jail 
Couldn't shoot a nigga nathan when he was havin' major mail 
He's a back stabba 
Should I say a Mac stabba 
Heres some Mac magic nigga - abra cadabra 
I just turned your ass into an official bitch 
Fuck you and your cousin Gilla- dirty snitch 
That fool got real niggas never comin' home 
And that's the type of shit niggas like you condone 
I used to have love for ya 
I used to bust with ya 
But now that you've crossed game nigga 
I can't fuck with ya
