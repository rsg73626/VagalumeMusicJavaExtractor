[Verse 1]
I'm Gettin' Northern Exposure In Sandy Arousa
The Ponderosa Where They Grow The Doshia
Thizzle Wiggle With That Thug Composure
Cuz When Them Streets Mold Ya You Gonna Be a Soulja
I'm Drinkin Ive In The Range Rover
I Beg God To Look Over My Shoulders
Sometimes I Slip Fuck trip I'm Not Perfect
Got Thug Im My Blood What I Love Ta Turf It
I Make it worth it i buy nice things
Tryna To Keep Life Right For Me And My Team
What Do You Mean
It's All About The Green
Tryna Ta Make My Duffle Bags Plus At The Scenes
I Get Ruffles Dad Yep Lots Of Cream
Got Them Haters Mad But I'll Pop The Thing
Take The Top Off The Heem
Pour Out A Little Liquor
My Game Gets Sicker When The Game Gets Thicker (Come On)

[Chorus x2]
Follow Me Now Let Me Lead The Way
If You Gon Believe In Something Believe In Dre
It's Only Civilized For Us To Live Our Lives
Royal,Spoiled,The American Way
Dreganomics

[Verse 2]
I Live Life Lav Feddy And Boss
Cuz Partner Whats Speghetti Without The Sauce

And I'll Never Be A Noodle
Cutthoat Pitbull Fucking Over Poodles
Strudle,Pies and Cakes

I Bite and Shake Go Right For The Juggalar
I Break A Broad Go Hard While You Lovin Her
Nigga Quit Huggin Her Giving Up That Free Love
We Pimp The Blood Outta Bitches Boy We Thugs
Keep Her Away From The Circle

Fina Go For The Gusto Start Stealin My Wealth
Entreprenuer Plantin Seeds In Manure
Making Change Grow and My Game Matures (Come On)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I Hunt For My Tribe Bring Home The Kill
Smoke Blunts Get High Off Only The Real
Want More Than A Mil Boy I Want A Mamwich
A Seven Figure Digit Money Sandwich
You Funny Faggits Are All In The Way
I Do More Before Breakfast Then You Do All Day
Hate To Sound Sexist But You All Gay
Quit Using That Oil Of Olay
Mac Dre A Lone Desperado
Who Gonna Press The Thottle If The Boys Try Ta Follow
My Boys Got The Hollows They Hurt When They Hit Ya
Leave Me Lone When You Gone Off That Purp And The Liquor
Nigga Im a Grown Ass Man
Tryna Live Off The Fat Of The Lamb
Procede As Planned Stay Focused

[Chorus x2]
