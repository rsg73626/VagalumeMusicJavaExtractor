Smurf cut it up 
Smurf cut it up 
Smurf cut it up 

[Verse 1] 
She's broke as a joke, I don't want yo bitch 
I want some rope and a gumbo mix 
I Mutombo hits, slap a bitch out the air 
It ain't fair I'm a California bear 
Grizzly Adams, in a Benz on Davins 
Thizzin', savin', gone off that log cabin 
Hocus, pocus, DJ Macadoscious 
Watch me turn these blunts into roaches 
I come with doses, while Smurf cut it up 
Let's nut it up and make punk shut it up 
I rub it up, smack it up and dick down it down 
Bustin' styles, like clips and rounds 
How you like me now, fool what it do 
It's don't hate the player part two 
How you like me now, fool what it do 
It's don't hate the player part two 

[Chorus] 
If you hate the player, you hate the game 
If you hate the player, you hate the game 
If you hate the player, you hate the game 
So if you hate the player, you hate the game 

[Verse 2] 
Man you been actin' kind of strange lately 
Because yo bitch licked and ate me 
You hate me, you hate the game 
It's fuckin' shame, like what's his name 
It's nothin mayne, you didn't need her 
She's raw, she jawed me in her two-seater 
A two-liter, in her mouth I busted 
Shake the broad dog, she can't be trusted 
She put mustard, on my hot dog 
And paid a pimp, before she shook the spot 
I'm top dog, don't hate it, every rims I skated 
Was chrome plated, I made it 
I'm successful, and you hate it, cause yo life is so stressful 
Thangs get a little easier, you got cheesier, and more pleasier
