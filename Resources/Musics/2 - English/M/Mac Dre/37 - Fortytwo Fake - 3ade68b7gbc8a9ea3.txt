FORTYTWO FAKE

[chorus] 
Ho upset Mac Dre come through 
(She told a nigga to come through) 
Let me whoop this puss on you 
(You can't whoop that puss on me) 
Ain't no ho puss worth my life 
(Ain't no puss worth my life) 
I ain't know this ho was shyst 
(I didn't know the ho was shyst) 

[verse 1] 

I met her on a Thursday at the DMV 
She was payin' registration I was tryin' to get an I.D. 
Didn't trip 'til she talked intellectual 
And the way she moved was hella sexual 
I threw bait, strictly experimental 
Dropped my pencil made it look accidental 
She bit quick like a big mouth bass 
And when she picked up my pencil all I saw was ass 
I said what's your name, she said my name's LaShawn 
I said excuse my ebonics, but baby you the bomb! 
She smiled, told me I was far from ugly 
Asked me how I was doin', I said lav lav lovely 
Looked at my watch, said my schedule's tight 
But if you give up the number I'll call your ass tonight 
Right 
She was with it and gave up the digits 
And when I called later on she said come visit 

[chorus] 

[verse 2] 

Who is it? She said when I knocked on the door 
I said it's young M D, oh you ain't knowin' 
Stepped inside and I can tell from a distance 
She was burning scented candles and maybe even incence 
Boy I tell ya she was in the mood 
She said I hope your hungry cause I cooked up some food 
She lit the fireplace threw on a love ballad 
Before the main course we ate shrimps and salad 
We talked for a while and drinked Zinfandel 
She had ass like ten games of big pin the tail 
On the donkey 
Chocolate, opposite from honkey 
All I can think about is hittin' that monkey 

[chorus] 

[verse 3] 

She was diggin' your folks, boy I could tell 
How she served fat steaks and big lobster tail 
On the first visit 
Everything exquisite 
The door bell rang she didn't ask who is it 
She must've knew dude, cause she gave some cash 
He kicked down a twomp sack and a fat gram of hash 
We smashed 
We turn joints to dubees 
She eightysixed the music and pull out three movies 
Mohogany 
The Mack 
Baby Got Back 
She said, I'll be right back 
Roll the rest of that sack 
I rolled the weed up 
Then I kicked my feet up 
Then two niggas came in with masks all G'd up 
The plot thickens 
I'm slippin' like a mutherfucka 
Mopped and chopped and gettin' treated like a sucka 
Five minutes ago I was feelin' fuck great 
But now I'm gagged up wrapped in duct tape 
They choke me 
Broke me 
And dropped me off on the bridge 
And all I can think about was killin' that bitch 
My worst mistake 
Fuckin' with a snake 
How a playa gonna fall for that Fortytwo Fake? 
That Fortytwo Fake 

[chorus to end]
