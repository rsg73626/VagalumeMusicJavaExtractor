AT THE BACK OF MY HEART

If you come around
After all that you've done
I'll understand
Comunication wait down
But you know where I can be found

Right now girl, at the back of my heart
There's a love left waiting there for you
Right now girl at the back of my heart
I can feel it coming on through

Don't wait too long
Before you call me up
I'm here alone
Perhaps you had it all wrong
There was nothing else going on

Right now girl, at the back of my heart
There's a love left waiting there for you
Right now girl at the back of my heart
I can feel it coming on through

Look in the mirror
You turning away
I can remember everything
Look in the mirror
I'm dying to say
Open your heart and let me in

I never say
All that I want to do
Let me explain
Forgive what happened before
For it we'll haven't no more

Right now girl, at the back of my heart
There's a love left waiting there for you
Right now girl at the back of my heart
I can feel it coming on through
