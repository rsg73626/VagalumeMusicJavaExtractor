PERFECT WORLD

[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for the sun to shine
I'm holding back the darkness from the night
Hold on 'till the morning light
It's not too late, not too late
I'm waiting for this world to turn
I run away to a place with no return
Raise your arm and take my hand
And follow me to a place that we should have

[Chorus]
A place that we should have
A place that we should have
In a perfect world
In a perfect world
In a perfect world

[Verse 2]
Why do we always cross the line?
Oh tell me now, tell me what have we become
Hold your breath and tell me what to do
Cause in a perfect world my heart still beats for you

[Chorus]
In a perfect world
In a perfect world
A place that we should have
A place that we should have

[Verse 3]
Hold on 'till the morning light
It's not too late, not too late
