NEVER HAD NOBODY LIKE YOU

Well since time out of mind I been lazy
and times before that I was cruel
and the times before that
I was mean, I was mad
Cuz I never had nobody like you

And the times before that I was crazy
I saw the dark side of the moon
And the stars in the sky
They never caught my eye
Cuz I never had nobody like you

But now it's just like ABC
Life's just like 1... 2.. 3

I watched my old habits die and it was painful
Sometimes it's painful in the light of the truth
But you kept me fast to the right
And I wanna thank you tonight
I ain't never had nobody like you

I trusted liars and thieves in my blindness
Honey, I was wasting away at the root
And now that I've been through that hell
I got a story to tell
I never had nobody like you
