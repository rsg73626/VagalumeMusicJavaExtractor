BIG BOAT

Well, he says he’s got a big boat
A high roller
And everybody knows its name
Oh, it’s a big boat and it pumps up the poor boys pride
Says he’s got a big boat, but it’s just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride

Says he’s got a big boat
A wide load
Enough to bring the party down
Oh yeah a big boat,
It ain’t no carnival cruise
Says he’s got a big boat but it’s just a fairy boat, enough to fit an extra one or two

Says he’s got a big boat, but it’s just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride

Says he's got a fast boat, talk about high speed
But everybody knows the truth
Oh hey, a big boat
Get your oars back in the water, kid
Says he’s got a fast boat, but it’s just a fairy boat it ain't to faster than a goldfish

Says he got a big boat but it’s just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
