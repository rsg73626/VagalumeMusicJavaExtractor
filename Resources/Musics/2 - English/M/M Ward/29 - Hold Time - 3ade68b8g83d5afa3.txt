HOLD TIME

You were beyond comprehension tonight
But I understood
Now if only I could
Hold time

Words have failed me tonight
But you knew what I meant
You heard what I said
The whole time

And I wrote this song about it
'cause I didn't care about any worthless photograph
I wrote this song just to remember
The endless, endless summer in your laugh

Da da da da da
Da da da dum da da
Da dum dum da
