SWEETHEARTS ON PARADE

Oh two by two
They go marching through
Oh sweethearts on parade

And how I cried
As they passed me by
Those sweethearts on parade

Id love to join them but
Well they wonâ€™t even look
Cause it takes more than one to join the army of love

So how I pine
Just to fall in line
With those sweethearts on parade

Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
