SHANGRI-LA

Up on the sun, this time tomorrow
Fly, walk, or run, but this time no sorrow
First stop, Jackson, next stop, Shangri-La
And I cannot wait to see the expression on the face of my sweet lord
And back on the trail this time tomorrow, by foot, wheel, or sail, but this time no sorrow
First stop, Jackson, next stop, Shangri-La
And I cannot wait to see the expression on the face of my sweet lord
No, I cannot wait to hear you call my name

And forget me not, this time tomorrow
I gave all I got, but this time no sorrow
First stop, Jackson, next stop, Shangri-La
And I cannot wait to see the expression on the face of my sweet lord
No, I cannot wait to hear you call my name
