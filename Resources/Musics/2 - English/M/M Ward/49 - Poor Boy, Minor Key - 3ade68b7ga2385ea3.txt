POOR BOY, MINOR KEY

poor boy
head against a pillow
fast asleep
poor girl
head against a window
lost in a dream

one day they will be as giants
stronger than the sun
but that day ain't yet come

wide world
wide world of sorrow
won't stand a chance
wide world
wide world of sorrow
won't stand a chance

one day they will be as giants
stronger than the sun
but that day ain't yet come
