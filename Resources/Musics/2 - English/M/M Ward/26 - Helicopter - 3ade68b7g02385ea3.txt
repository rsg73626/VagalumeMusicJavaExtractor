HELICOPTER

(this song was recorded before)

I am somewhere in this city
I am climbing up a fire escape
I am somewhere in this city
I am climbing up a fire escape
I have gotta save my baby
from the mess this world has made.

I arrive through a window
I leave through a whole in the wall
I arrive through a window
I leave through a whole in the wall
I scramble down the stairwell
with my baby, cradle and all.

Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset,
I have done all I can do in this town.

Tom, violence has taken
the wind out of my sails
Tom, violence has taken
the wind out of my sails
Helicopter has taken to
breaking this dream as well.
(this song was recorded before)

My mind is 'a racing
my heart is prepared somehow
My mind is 'a racing
my heart is prepared somehow
For that searchlight come shining
and find me under a cloud.

Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset,
I have done all I can do in this town.
