A VOICE AT THE END OF THE LINE

If all I had was just one final call,
Would you answer my ring?
Would you hear me at all?

Oh when I spent my life, trying to make someone mine,
now all I want is a voice at the end of the line.

I lost my luck in a unlucky bet,
Could you clear my name?
Could you cancel my debt?

Oh when I spent my life, trying to make up my mind,
now all I want is a voice at the end of the line.

I spent way to much time beside myself
I don't know what I was thinking about
Oh but deep in my mind I am dialing your number now.
