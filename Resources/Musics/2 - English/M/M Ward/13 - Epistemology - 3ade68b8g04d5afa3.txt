EPISTEMOLOGY

I was raised in a Catholic school, learned who to fire with and pray to
I learned how to hold on from a book of old psalms
And if you're trying to sing an old song and you're getting all the words wrong
Well, you're just a-following along too closely in the book

I learned how to keep my head from something Paul said
About keeping the fruit in the spirit from the chorus down to the hook
And sometimes I wonder what in God's name did I do to deserve you
Oh, to deserve you

Cause I just rolled and I tumbled, down a long road, I stumbled
While shooting in the dark as to what's best
And finally, I found you
Without ever learning how to
I put the right foot in front of the leg
And beyond that is anybody's guess

I learned how to keep my head from something Paul said
About keeping the fruit in the spirit from the chorus down to the hook
Oh, and sometimes I wonder what in God's name did I do to deserve you
Oh, to deserve you

Cause I just rolled and I tumbled, down a long road, I stumbled
While shooting in the dark as to what's best
And finally, I found you without ever learning how to
I put the right foot in front of the leg

Cause I just rolled and I tumbled, down a long road, I stumbled
While shooting in the dark as to what's best
Oh, as to what's best, as to what's best
And finally, I found you
Without ever learning how to
I put the right foot in front of the leg
And beyond that is anybody's guess
