BAD DREAMS

Oh! Every night I’m dreaming of you and 
we’re weaving through a crowded room
and I ask you to be my best friend too and then I lose you.
On a steamer with a small-city band I chase you 
through the room again and you’re gone before the next dance ends

(I don’t what it means) Bad Dreams
but I should do what I want to do and I should dream 
about whoever I want to dream about
but every night I’m calling out your name and every time you get away.
Oh and I’m damned before I even begin 
but ill chase you through the room again
and I’ll ask you to be my best best friend and then I lose you.
