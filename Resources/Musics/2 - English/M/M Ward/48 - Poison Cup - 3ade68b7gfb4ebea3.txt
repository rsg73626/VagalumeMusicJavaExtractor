POISON CUP

One 
One 
One 
One or two won't do 
Cos I want it all 

And a sip 
A sip 
A sip or a spoonful won't do 
No, I want it all 

And I hope 
I hope 
Hope you know what I'm thinking of 
I want all of your love 
I need all of your love 

She said "If love 
If Love 
Is a posion cup 
Then drink it up" 

"Cos a sip 
A sip 
Or a spoonful won't do 
Won't do nothing for you 
Except mess you up" 

And I hope 
I hope 
Hope you know what this means 
I'm gonna give you everything 
I'm gonna give you everything
