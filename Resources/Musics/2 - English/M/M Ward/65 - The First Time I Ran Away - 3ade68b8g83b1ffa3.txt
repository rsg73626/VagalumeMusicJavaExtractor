THE FIRST TIME I RAN AWAY

The first time I ran away
I saw faces in the trees
I heard voices in the storms
They say

At a waterfall

The second time I ran away
I saw warriors on the train
Catching tigers by the tail
They say

Cuz the way they look at you
As if you were stranger
The way they talk to you
As if you were a child

At a waterfall

The last time I run away
Well, I hope it is with you
Will you let me show you where to run

At a waterfall
