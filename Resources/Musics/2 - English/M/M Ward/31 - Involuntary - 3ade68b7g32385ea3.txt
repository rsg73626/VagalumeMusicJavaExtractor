INVOLUNTARY

have you ever been alone in the night time
and you're thinking that you just don't know
and that feeling grows
without control

and you're thinking about a place to go
but your body tells you
"stay at home"
it's involuntary

and When the phone has lost it's bell
and the doorbell has lost it's sound
you're only hearin your heart pound
it's involuntary

and have you ever tried to leave at the right time
but the right time seems to come so slow
and that feeling grows
without control

and you're thinking about a place to go
but your body tells you
"stay at home"
it's involuntary

and When the phone has lost it's bell
and the doorbell has lost it's sound
you're only hearin your heart pound
it's involuntary
