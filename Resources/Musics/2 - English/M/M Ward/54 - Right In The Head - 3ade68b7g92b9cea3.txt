RIGHT IN THE HEAD

I hope my little brother puts a call in today
I hope he don't forget where he came from
I hope he never has to deal with wrongin' someone

'cause I lived with many ghosts when I was younger
and I will live with many ghosts until I go

I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
even if he has to wrong someone

I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
even if he has to wrong someone

and I hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand
if ever they get ambushed or pursued
I hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty duel he's brewed
and though the names will get changed to protect the innocent
he said, "I hope the names will get changed to protect me."

I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
even if he has to wrong someone

I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
even if he has to wrong someone

'cause I lived with many ghosts when I was younger
and I will live with many ghosts until I go
