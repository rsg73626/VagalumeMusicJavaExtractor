OUTTA MY HEAD

Oh a playful little kitten met a playful little bird,
and then off with it's head, off with it's head, oh my!

And a breeze met a blossom in a winter embrace
and then off with it's head, off with it's head, oh my!

Am I outta my head, outta my head my love?
Am I outta my head or is this real life?

(no clue on the this verse at all!)
and then off with my head, off with my head, oh my!

Once you taught me how to crawl, and you taught me how to cry
and then off with my head, off with my head, oh my!

Am I outta my head, outta my head my love?
Am I outta my head or is this goodbye?
Am I outta my head or is this goodbye?
