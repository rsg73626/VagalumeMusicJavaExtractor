MAGIC TRICK

People come, people go 
Sometimes without goodbye, sometimes without hello 

She's got one magic trick 
Just one and that's it 
Ooh... She disappears 

It's like, now you see her, now you don't 
You think you're gonna get to know her now, well you won't 

She's got one magic trick 
Just one and that's it 
Ooh... Ooh... She disappears 

Aah... Aah... 

It's like, easy come, easy go 
Sometimes without goodbye, sometimes without hello 

She's got one magic trick 
Just one and that's it 
Ooh... She disappears 
Ooh... And that's it
