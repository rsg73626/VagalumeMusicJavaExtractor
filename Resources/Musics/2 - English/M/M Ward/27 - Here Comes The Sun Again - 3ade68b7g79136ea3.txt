HERE COMES THE SUN AGAIN

Kingdoms and queens they all bow down to you
Ranches and ranch hands are bowing too
And I'm takin off my straw hat for you, singin'
Here comes the sun again

And the leaves on the trees they all call out your name,
Chrome on the freight line shines the same,
And the stars in their cars roll their tops down for you, singin'
Here comes the sun again

Oh but if you're gonna stay,
Show some mercy today
Blow that breeze on my face

Snow banks and drifts down the hillside for you
Slides inside sandy river before the day is through
And before evenin falls i may find myself there too, singin'
Here comes the sun again,
Here comes the sun again...
