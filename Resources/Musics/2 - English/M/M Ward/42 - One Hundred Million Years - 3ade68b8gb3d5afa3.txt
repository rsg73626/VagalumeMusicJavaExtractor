ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS

This river that we ride
Has always been alive
O my soul one hundred million years

This river that we ride
Will roll on when we die
O my soul one hundred million years

And this love, this light
Between you and I
Is older than that burning ball of fire up in the sky
And the gale that fills our sails

The lights that shine tonight
Have always been alive
O my soul one hundred million years

The lights that shine tonight
Will burn on when we die
O my soul one hundred million years

And this love, this light
Between you and I
Is older than that burning ball of fire up in the sky
And the gale that fills our sails
