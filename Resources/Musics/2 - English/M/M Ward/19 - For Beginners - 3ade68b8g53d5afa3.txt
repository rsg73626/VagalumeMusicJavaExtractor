FOR BEGINNERS

When you're absolute beginners
Its a panoramic view
From her majesty Mt. Zion
And the kingdom is for You

When you tumble upon that valley
Shock of sparrow Line the stairs
When the arrows Start descending
Then they scatter everywhere

On a bookshelf in California
Sits the map of passageways
Best to stumble upon Mt. Zion
To behold the natural gate

Ah - ha

They say the original sinners
Never felt a drop of pain
Until that second in the garden
Then they felt it each and every day

So draw back your bows you hunters
Who have never felt that flame
But the absolute beginners
They are safe in the shade for today...

Ah - ha...
