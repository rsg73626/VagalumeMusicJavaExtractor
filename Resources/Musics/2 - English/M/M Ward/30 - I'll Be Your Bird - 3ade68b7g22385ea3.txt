I'LL BE YOUR BIRD

I'm not the tiger, he never had,
I'm not the first hit when you got it bad.
I'm not your second, I'm not your third,
I'll be your bird.

I'm not your Chesnutt,
I'm not your Mould,
I'm not your DJ on late night radio,
I'll be the first one to ask where you were,
I'll be your bird.

Then when there's no one to care, I could protect like I've always been there,
I'll become your bear.

I'll sing statistics, & hide the truth,
I'll tell your dad anything you want me to,
I'll hide your locket under the dirt,
I'll be your bird.
