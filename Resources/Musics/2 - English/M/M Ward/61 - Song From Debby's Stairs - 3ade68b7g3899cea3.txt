SONG FROM DEBBY'S STAIRS

I know the next life gonna be a good life for me
I know the next run gonna be a good one for me

I made a drawing of accuracy that painted it real gorgeous
I'd share it with you tonight, my friend, but I left it on the bus
I left it on the schoolbus

I know the next life gonna be a good life for me
I know the next run gonna be a good one for me

I remember Manzanita, a school made out of brick
Underneath that black scratchboard is where I found the stick
That's where I found the yardstick

I know the next life gonna be a good life for me
I know the next run gonna be a good one for me

Gloria found a drawing of accuracy that painted it real gorgeous
She leaned closely and over to me, said she found it on the bus
She found it on the schoolbus
