LOOK ME OVER

I don't need no sweets to make me happy
I'm not like them babe, I won't be fooled by nothing.
Whistle me out and I'll roll over
Hey, look me over!

My part-time job, it ain't exactly thrilling
But my heart knows more and it won't be fooled by nothing
Call me before I'm keeling over
Hey, look me over!

And I know it ain't time for me to go
You don't think so!

Friends won't let guys sleep up on their couches
When word comes down that he stains all he touches
I was too late I know, look me over
It's too late I know, look me over
It's too late I know, look me over
But hey, look me over!
