GET TO THE TABLE ON TIME

Well they called me once, and they called me twice
Third time they called me was cold as ice,
they say "Get to the table, Get to the table on time!"
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Better get to the table, get to the table on time.

And the Lord of Lords, he laid out a feast,
he said "Listen to me boys, this will be last one of these,
So you better get to the table, get to the table on time."
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Better get to the table, get to the table on time.
