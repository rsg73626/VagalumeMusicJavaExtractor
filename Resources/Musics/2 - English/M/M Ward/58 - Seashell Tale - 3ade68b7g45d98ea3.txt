SEASHELL TALE

Lets go play some money on the order the horses
Break the ribbon of that famous finish line
And then gather up our stash, babe
Find a little ranch, babe
And buy a lonely little pony to ride

Well I knew I was lucky
When a needle came and stuck me
A porcupine came and poked this cactus hide
Let me finish what I start, babe
Open up your heart, babe
I'll sow a land of milk and honey in your mind

Oh flesh and blood has found me in your arms again
I see the whisper of the wind has found your hair again
And though my heart said "give me refuge"
In your dignity my dear
All I could do is put a seashell to your ear

Oh flesh and blood has found me in your arms again
I see the whisper of the wind has found your hair again
And though my heart said "give me refuge"
In your dignity my dear
All I could do is put a seashell to your ear
