HI-FI

Hi-Fi

Where you gonna run to now
That you ain’t got space to fill
What you gonna do with your time now
You ain’t got time to kill

Where you locked in coverage falling in time
And it’s hot enough just to let your song go by
I’m gonna give it to you
If you let me give it to you

Hey hey

So let me turn the volume up get a little bit of Hi-Fi
Drown out all the sirens in the back of my mind

Bah bah bah ba

Now you gonna settle your ties
With you aint got bind to tie up
Why burn your bridges?
When you can blow your bridges up

Where you locked in coverage falling in time
And it’s hot enough just to let your ideas go by
I’m gonna give it to you
If you let me give it to you

Hey hey

So let me turn the volume up get a little bit of Hi-Fi
Drown out all the sirens in the back of my mind

Let me turn the volume up get a little bit of Hi-Fi
Drown out all the sirens in the back of my mind

Now they’re calling all cars from the north to the Southside
Better get the east and its coming from the Westside
They’re calling all cars from the north to the Southside
Better get the east and its coming from the Westside
