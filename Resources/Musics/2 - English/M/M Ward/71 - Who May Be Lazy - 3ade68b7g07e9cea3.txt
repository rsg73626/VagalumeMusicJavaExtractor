WHO MAY BE LAZY

And what makes me happy
And who makes me high
Sure won't be around on that night

And who may be lazy
And he who has lied
He who was last shall be first in the line

So take me out dancing
And sing me to sleep
This could be the last night that we'll ever dream

And who may be lazy
And he who has lied
He who was last shall be first in the line

Hmmm...
