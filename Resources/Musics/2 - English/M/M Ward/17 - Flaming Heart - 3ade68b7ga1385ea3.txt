FLAMING HEART

Well I'm trying hard to pass the time but I just got more time to kill
You know the flaming heart can't get his fill
But the flaming heart will try and try as he will

And the flaming eyes I had are gone, they went out with the thrill
You know the flaming heart can't get his fill
But the flaming heart will try and try as he will

Ooooh, I got a flaming heart
Ooooh, I got a flaming heart
I gotta roll like a tire
I've got a love that's mighty like a rose

And the flaming stars I had are gone
They burned out over the hill
You know the flaming heart can't get his fill
But the flaming heart will try and try as he will

Ooooh, I got a flaming heart
Ooooh, I got a flaming heart
I gotta roll like a tire
I've got a love that's mighty like a rose
