ELLA

For you I have travelled far and wide
For to hear your lullabye
Hey rock-a-bye

And if you can't keep an eye on
At least just leave a light on for me

And I chose a star to be my guide
Chose the moon to be my bride (and never die)

And if you can't keep an eye on
At least just leave a light on for me

We are tireless fighters
But we cannot make it on our own
We are bareback riders
We are lost on our way back home

And if you can't keep an eye on
At least just leave a light on for me
