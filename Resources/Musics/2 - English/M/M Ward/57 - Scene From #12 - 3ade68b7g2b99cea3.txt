SCENE FROM #12

Cough, cough
And hacking in the hallway
And he don't even cover his mouth

Hack, Hack
And hacking in the morning
The elevator echoe his disease

I think he knows I can hear him night and day
I think he knows I can not live this way, oh
I think he knows that I ain't sleeping
I ain't sleeping
I ain't...
I ain't sleeping
I ain't sleeping
I ain't...

Well, it was quiet and "Crash!"
One night I heard him tumble
Shaking fell a painting from a wall

And here and gone
The silent apartment
And now there's never any disturbances at all

I think he knows I can hear him night and day
I think he knows I can not live this way, oh
I think he knows that I ain't sleeping
I ain't sleeping
I ain't...
I ain't sleeping
I ain't sleeping
I ain't...
I ain't sleeping
I ain't sleeping
I ain't...
I ain't sleeping
I ain't sleeping
I ain't...
