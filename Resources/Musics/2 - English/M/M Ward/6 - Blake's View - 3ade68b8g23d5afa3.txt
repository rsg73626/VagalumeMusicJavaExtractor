BLAKE'S VIEW

"Death is just a door"
Blake said it first
It's just another room we enter
It's the threshold that hurts

Birth is just a chorus
And Death is just a Verse
In the great song of spring
That the mockingbrids sing

We come and we go
A-weeping and a-wailing
Our heads in the hands of the nurse
Put your head on my shoulder, baby
Tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only
Could it get any worse?

I say, "death is just a door
You'll be Reunited on the other side"
It's alright
"Death is just a door
You'll be reunited bye and bye"
