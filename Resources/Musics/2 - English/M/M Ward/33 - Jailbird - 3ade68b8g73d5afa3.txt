JAILBIRD

Jailbird jailbird singing through the wires
Cuz his cage is closed and he's stuck inside
Singing "Who's gonna hear my 'help me help me' now?"

Hangman hangman knocking on the door
Says "Heaven can't wait to have you no more
So who's gonna hear your 'help me help me' now?
...'better go find another best friend somehow'."

"Angel angel coming for me now
On eagles' wings down through the clouds
Save my soul 'fore they lay my old body down

So there's nothing but skin and bones
Hiding under a dead man's clothes
Six feet deep in a black box Underground
