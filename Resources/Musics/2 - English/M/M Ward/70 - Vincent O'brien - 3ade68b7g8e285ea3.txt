VINCENT O'BRIEN

He only sings when he's sad and he's sad all the time
So he sings the whole night through
(yeah he sings in the daytime too)

He only dreams when he's sad and he's sad all the time
So he dreams the whole night through
(yeah he dreams in the daytime too)

There may be mermaids under the water
There may even be a man in the moon
Oh but Vince your time is runnin' out
You better get yourself together soon!

Out of Buffalo the man
Below the belt he swung
And then after the bell has rung,
another cheapshot here it comes!
Another cheapshot here it comes!

He only laughs when he's sad and he's sad all the time
So he laughs the whole night through
(yeah he laughs in the daytime too)

There may be mermaids under the water
There may even be a man in the moon
Oh but Vince your time is runnin' out
I hope you get yourself together soon!
I hope you get yourself together soon!
