HE ASKED ME TO BE A SNAKE & LIVE UNDERGROUND

Oh, redemption is a pure signal
It's high in the pines like a bald eagle
But I've only seen it once or twice
He wanted me to follow but I fell down
And he asked me to be a snake and live underground

I know sympathy is a pure signal
It's high in the pines like a bald eagle
But I've only seen it once or twice
He wanted me to follow but I fell down
And he asked me to be a snake
And he asked me to be a snake
And he asked me to be a snake and live underground
