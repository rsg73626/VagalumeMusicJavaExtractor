PAUL'S SONG

Seems like everywhere I go the sky is falling
And the concierges they meet you with a frown
When I come to town
I ain't gonna' lie to you
Well, every town is all the same

You say: "how does it feel to be travelling?
How's it feel to live your life on a train?
And the aeroplane?"
Well, I ain't gonna' lie to you
Well, every town is all the same
When you've left your heart in the Portland rain...

And how I wish it was not true
But I ain't gonna stand up here and lie to you
I believe y'all deserve more than that
And if there's one thing that I've learned
Brother, you know you're gonna get burned
If you don't know where your love is at

"How d'you plan to get yourself connected?
Are you down with all the latest trends?"
To keep up with friends
Well, I ain't gonna' lie to you
Well, every plan is all the same

Seems like everywhere I go the sky is falling
And the waitress says she'll meet you with a frown
When I come to town
I ain't gonna' lie to you
Well, every town is all the same
When you've left your heart in the Portland rain...
