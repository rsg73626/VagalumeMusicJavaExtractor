OH LONESOME ME

Everybody's going out, having fun
I'm a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how, oh, I got set free
Oh lonesome me

Must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past and find someone new
I thought of everything from A to Z
Oh lonesome me
Oh lonesome me

Oh and I bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Dancing with other boys with other charms

Oh but I still love her so
Oh and brother, don't you know
That I would welcome her back, right back here in these arms

Bad mistake I'm making by just hanging around
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
Oh lonesome me
Oh lonesome me
