CAROLINA

"Where are you going?" for the 250th time.
"I’m waiting for a sign"
"Well it looks like another line"
and I’m walking backwards to the place where I come from
but that aint enough, no you want me to run.

I used to feel like California with baby’s eyes so blue
now I feel like Carolina: I split myself in two
And I’m walking backwards from Chicago through Washington
but that aint enough no you want me to run.

"Better watch your soul it’ll leave you like a hundred bucks."
My friends said “Stick to your guns” but instead I just got stuck
And I’m walking backwards looking forward to getting done
but that aint enough no you want me to run
