O'BRIEN/O'BRIEN'S NOCTURNE

Well we talked about old times
Like a couple of old guys
And took a little walk to the old baseball diamond
And along came O'Brien
With a guitar in his hand
Met us on the field with impeccable timing

He said I got a new song to show ya
Though it probably ain't gonna blow your mind
And the thing about O'Brien was
He could always make a string buzz like it was 1989
And I remember my old car and that old girlfriend of mine

It was a cracked wooden thing
He said wanna talk about old strings
It's been 10, 12 years since I last changed mine
And it says Sears down the neck
Had a little blood stain on the second fret
But you know it still keeps impeccable timing

And he said I got a brand new song to show ya
Though it probably ain't gonna blow your mind
And the thing about O'Brien was
He could always make a string buzz like it was still 1989
And I remember my old car and that old girlfriend of mine

And that's the story about O'Brien blew my mind
