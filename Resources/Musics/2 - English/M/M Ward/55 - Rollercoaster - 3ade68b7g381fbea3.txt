ROLLERCOASTER

You're like a rollercoaster 
You got heavy metal wings 
You could make a dead man scream 
You're like a rollercoaster 

Rollercoaster, we was the best of times 
Rollercoaster, we was the worst of times too 
Because you lift me up so high high high 
It's the most unbelievable ride 

You're like a rollercoaster 
You give me heavy metal dreams 
You can make a dead man scream 
You're like a rollercoaster 

Rollercoaster, can't find my friends on the ground 
Just lift me up and send me spiralling down 
Because you lift me up so high high high 
It's the most unbelievable ride 

You're like a rollercoaster 
Heavy metal wings 
Make a dead man scream 
Rollercoaster 
Rollercoaster 
Rollercoaster
