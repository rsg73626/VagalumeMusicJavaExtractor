IT WON'T HAPPEN TWICE

Oh, lightning may strike your poor heart tonight
But it won't happen twice, my friend
And all the love you deserve is coming on stormy winds

And I was jealous and cruel to a young girl I knew
But it wont happen twice, my friend
Oh, if I get the chance I'll be braver like holy wine

And disaster has riddled my body with holes
But it won't happen twice, my friend
It won't happen twice, my friend
And I know it because I know it, child
It can not happen again

And a hurricane blew my bright stars away
But it won't happen twice, my friend.
I'm flat on my back and I'm travelling like dizzy spells

All these inside fires have burned up these outside things
All these inside fires have burned up these outside things

But it won't happen twice, my friend
It won't happen twice, my friend
And I know it because I know it, child
It can not happen again

Oh, it won't happen twice, my friend
It won't happen twice, my friend
And I know it because I know it, child
It can not
Can not happen again
