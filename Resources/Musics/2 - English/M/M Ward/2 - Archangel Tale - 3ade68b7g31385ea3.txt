ARCHANGEL TALE

Come with me and you’ll never be the same.
Come with me to the place I’m thinking of 
(across the bridge that keeps you form your love).
Come with me but you must come alone 
(across the bridge that keeps you from your home)

A Band of a Hundred Angels did I see & a chariot of white swung low
(across the River Jordan for me)
Come with me to the place your thinking of 
(across the bridge that keeps you from your love)
and so I followed the band of angels to a shore 
and climbed atop a mountain high
and a ray of light shown down upon the stone 
a savior rolled away long ago…
