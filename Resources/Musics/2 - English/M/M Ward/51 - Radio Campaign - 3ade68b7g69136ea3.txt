RADIO CAMPAIGN

Well I been pushed to the edge,
By my head ache blues.
And I got pulled by the pull of the tide.

I got stripped of my soul,
Standing in my shoes,
Come back, come back
My little peace of mind

Come back, come back
My little peace of mind

Since the day you been gone,
I cannot keep from crying.
Come back, come back
My little peace of mind.

I sent signals and signs,
from a mountainside
Now I'm gonna try this old microphone light

Now i'm callin' out your name on this radio campaign.
Come back, come back
My little peace of mind.

Come back, come back
My little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone
I cannot keep from crying.

Come back, come back
My little peace of mind.
