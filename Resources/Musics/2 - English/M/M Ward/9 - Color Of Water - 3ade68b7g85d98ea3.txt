COLOR OF WATER

I was all geared up and ready to go
bounding for to leave my mountain home with a sky of blue
between the leaves and the color of the water was green
high over the sea.

“Do you have to leave so soon my boy?
The winter time aint even begun….”
“Well I’d stay awhile,” I turned to
say.
“But the color of the water is grey and I’m going away…”
