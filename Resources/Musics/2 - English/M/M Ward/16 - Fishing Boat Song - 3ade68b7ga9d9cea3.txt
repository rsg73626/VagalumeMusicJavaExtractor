FISHING BOAT SONG

From Springfield, Mass. to Concord Town,
I saw those lights go down,
In a gorge in Kansas,
I met my Jesus,
He laid me down and he said,

If I build you a fishing boat,
Would you leave everyone you know?
If I build you a fishing boat,
Would you leave everyone you know?

Would you be more likely to kill more time with me?
And then a sudden gale began to wail,
It set my heart like no other love,
Like no other love.

From Springfield, Mass. to Concord Town,
I saw my lights go down.
