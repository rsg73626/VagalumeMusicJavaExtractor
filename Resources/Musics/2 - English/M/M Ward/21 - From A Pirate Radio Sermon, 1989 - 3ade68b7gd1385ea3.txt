FROM A PIRATE RADIO SERMON, 1989

Wise won't be wise anymore
And might won't be might anymore
And I am waiting for the day when I will finally know surrender
And the weak will not be weak anymore

Lost won't be lost anymore
Hard won't be hard anymore
And I am waiting for the day when I will finally know surrender
And the weak will not be weak anymore

And I'll be waiting like a stranger for a train
For a headlight through the rain
I don't know the day or hour
But I can sense the final power

Yours won't be yours anymore
Theirs won't be theirs anymore
I am waiting for the day when I will finally know surrender
And the weak will not be weak anymore
No the weak will not be weak anymore
