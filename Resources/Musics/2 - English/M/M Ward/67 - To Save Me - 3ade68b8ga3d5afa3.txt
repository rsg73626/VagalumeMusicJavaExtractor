TO SAVE ME

He push a breath of air and he fills every sail in sight
He push a breath of air and he fills every sail in sight
He spin a big blue ball and your day turns into night

He shifts in his sleep and the Earth begins to quake
Yeah, he shifts in his sleep and the Earth begins to quake
So how much difference could it possibly make
Yeah, how much effort could it possibly take
To save me from sailing over the edge?

'cause he could strike a match and your world goes up in flames
Yeah, he could strike a match and your world goes up in flames
He spin a big blue ball and your night turns into day
