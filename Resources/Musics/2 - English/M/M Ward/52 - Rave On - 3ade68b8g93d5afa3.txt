RAVE ON

Well, the little things you say and do make me want to be with you
Rave on
Rave on this crazy feeling
I know
I know it's got me reeling when you say "I love you," I say "rave on"
I say "rave on," I say, "rave on"
My, my, my "rave on"
I say, "rave on"

And the way you look when you say goodnight
The way you make up when we fight
Rave on
Rave on this crazy feeling
I know it's got me reeling when you say "I love you," I say "rave on"
I say "rave on"
I say "rave on"
My, my, my rave on
I say "rave on"
I say "rave on"
I say "rave on"
My, my, my rave on
Oh, my rave on
Rave on
It's a crazy feeling
I know
What's got me reeling
So bad
You're revealing your love for me
Rave on
Oh, rave on, tell me
Tell me
Tell me not to be lonely
Tell me
Tell me you love me only, rave on to me
Oh, rave on to me

Rave on
I say, rave on 
My, my, my rave on
I say, rave on
My, my, my...
