SO MUCH WATER

water, so much water is under the bridge. have not seen you since I was 21
and you know I was just a kid
and I have oh so many friends who talk you up like your someone new
yeah but I've already gotten over you

times, times where the lamps were lit so low
well only a stranger would think its impossible to let them go
and I have oh so many flashback scenes that I can calmly walk straight through
and now my mind is free to walk the streets we used to walk so quietly
and laid the foundation for this handful of rhymes well I have left the frustration behind my eyes

"wait! don't let your dream just walk away!"
exactly how many times have I heard that one today
yeah we have oh so many friends who like to pretend we're still in high school
"water, so much water is under the bridge"
