FOUR HOURS IN WASHINGTON

Well, it’s one in the morning and I can’t sleep at night-
I hear wolves around the doorstep -
They’re circling outside.
I count ‘em jumping over fences, and landing on the sheet
Now, it’s two in the morning and I can’t fall asleep.

It’s two in the morning and I can’t fall asleep-
There’s a wind in the willows
And it’s a howling down the street
I hear it picking up the garbage, gon’ fly it to the moon
Now it’s three in the morning better get some sleeping soon.

It’s three in the morning better get some sleeping soon-
I’m gonna count the numbers in the counselor’s room
And if I miss a beat, well, then it’s off with my head
Now it’s four in the morning and I’m twisting in my bed.

It’s four in the morning and I’m turning in my bed-
I wish I had a dream or a nightmare in my head,
So I drop my imagination and get some sleeping done
Now it’s five in the morning and I’m wishing it was one.
