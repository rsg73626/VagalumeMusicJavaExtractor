SAD, SAD SONG

Oh I went to the Doctor, I said Doctor please,
what do you do when your true love leaves?
He said the hardest thing in the world to do,
is to find somebody believes in you.

Make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad sad song
Make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song...

And so I went to the whippoorwill, I said whippoorwill please,
what do you do when your true love leaves?
He said I only have but one trick up my sleeve,
I sing it over and over 'til she comes back to me.

I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad sad song
I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song...

And so I went to the whale, I said killer whale please,
what do you do when your true love leaves?
He said I only have but one trick up my sleeve,
I sing it over and over 'til she comes back to me.

I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad sad song
I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song...

Oh I went to my mama, I said mama please,
what do you do when your true love leaves?
She said the hardest thing in the world to do,
is to find somebody believes in you.
