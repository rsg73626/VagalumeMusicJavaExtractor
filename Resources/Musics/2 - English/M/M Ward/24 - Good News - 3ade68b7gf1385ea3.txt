GOOD NEWS

When I forget how to cry
I see you out alone at night
My heart explodes in light in sky
And I want to close my eyes

When I forget how to give
I see you out alone with him
His heart explodes in light in sky
And I want to close my eyes
And I want to say and bring good news to you

When I forget how to try
I'm wide awake alone at night
My heart explodes in light in sky
But I have to close my eyes
And I want to say and bring good news to you
