CHINESE TRANSLATION

I sailed a wild, wild sea 
climbed up a tall, tall mountain 
I met a old, old man 
beneath a weeping willow tree 
He said now if you got some questions 
go and lay them at my feet 
but my time here is brief 
so you'll have to pick just three 

And I said 
What do you do with the pieces of a broken heart 
and how can a man like me remain in the light 
and if life is really as short as they say 
then why is the night so long 
and then the sun went down 
and he sang for me this song 

See I once was a young fool like you 
afraid to do the things 
that I knew I had to do 
So I played an escapade just like you 
I played an escapade just like you 
I sailed a wild, wild sea 
climbed up a tall, tall mountain 
I met an old, old man 
he sat beneath a sapling tree 
He said now if you got some questions 
go and lay them at my feet 
but my time here is brief 
so you'll have to pick just three 

And I said 
What do you do with the pieces of a broken heart 
and how can a man like me remain in the light 
and if life is really as short as they say 
then why is the night so long 
and then the sun went down 
and he played for me this song
