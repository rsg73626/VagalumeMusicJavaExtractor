TO GO HOME

hoping my mind don't slip
sailing on a sinking ship
into the sunset in day
dark night on a long highway
little lights in the houses say
there's somebody staying up late
whoa-oh

I'll be true to you
oh yeah, you know I will
I'll be true to you forever or until
I go home

God, it's great to be alive
takes the skin right off my hide
to think I'll have to give it all up someday

and if I ever treated you mean
you know that it was only because
I'm sorry i couldn't have you for my own
whoa-oh

I'll be true to you
oh yeah, you know I will
I'll be true to you forever or until
I go home
I go home
I, I, I, I go home
I, I, I, I go home
I, I, I, I go home
