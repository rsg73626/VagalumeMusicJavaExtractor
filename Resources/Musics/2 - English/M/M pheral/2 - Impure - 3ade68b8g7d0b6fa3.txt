IMPURE

Conceived without love.
Mistake you try to hide.
I'm your hate between men.
I can see what you really are.

I'm the reason of you hopelessness.
I'm the pain you had to love.
I'm the end of all your dreams.
Don't you know?

what I really feel.
I am so impure.
I would find the way.
I need to alleviate this longliness.
Which is consumming me.

Maybe just a cry for help.
Help me I'm so alone.
