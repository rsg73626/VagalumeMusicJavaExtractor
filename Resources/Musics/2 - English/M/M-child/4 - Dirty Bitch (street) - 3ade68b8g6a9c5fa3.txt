DIRTY BITCH (STREET)

[M-Child] [Chorus]

(Dirty bitch, a dirty bitch)
She's a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
I heard your momma was a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
I heard your sister was a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
Your grandmomma was a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
Your baby-momma was a...

[M-Child]

Head, freaky hoes, if you want a big dick,
A nigga with some money but don't ever buy you shit.
Fuckin' in any position plus eatin' up the nut quick,
A baller type from Orange Mound, M-Child, bitch.
Hit me up on the horn, booty-calling at the frame,
I'll be over in a jiffy what's about some Mary Jane.
Taking these hoes every time I tell 'em my name,
Shake that hoes like I'm like Michael Jordan, 'cause I've got game.
Keep my bitches in line, like motherfucking Soul Train,
Get her a puh-perm for the Kamikaze gang-bang.
Camcorder on the dresser, I tell her whatever,
Shake it sideways, taking off that tight black leather.
Dick standing straight up, like a nigga in the Marines,
Balls hanging like the bandana tied on to my jeans.
I'll be ready for war; your pussy wet, let's get it on,
Let me see how you're working, yo, let my dick folly' home.

[Chorus x2]

[???]

Tell me nigga, what makes a bitch worth it to be called dirty?
The ones who wanna suck on my dick like I'm a Slurpee?
Or jerk it, I keep 'em work' it, while my dick she can't burn it,
Packages going around town, nigga, I know you heard it.
Money, she don't deserve it; bitch, they make us some work'ets,
The fact that she done fucked the whole hood's making me nervous.
Saying she opened up a business.. Bitch, please, I never spend it,
Kamikaze won't buy, nor lease, or know where we rent it.
Thought you had me, now didn't you.. 'cause your pussy printed,
On them tight-ass Capris, macking; nigga, break your knees.
MC H(?) I be, be spotting them dirty knees,
Sort 'em out from the ones who be chewing through the holes in the sheets.
Touch my dick like I sneeze, on a house like Shami's,
Never sharing my trees, that's for the clique not dirty.
Asking me for some money; bitch, don't give me your keys.
It's Kamikaze for life and we talking your dirty knees.

[Chorus x2]

[M-Child]

To you haters, I got it made, 'bout bitches, I'm getting paid,
Stirring bitches round and round, like I'm making Kool-aid.
They be dropping off loot, once I tell them I think they cute,
And tell them a lie or two, introduce them to my crew.
Stan Man, MC Mack, thugs from Tha Southside,
By the time I'm through explaining, big dick they wanna ride.
Licking they lips, rubbing they twat, yo, come inside.
Glow-in-the-dark rubber so they pussy can't hide.
Represent where you from, dirty bitch, your mouth cold,
Pain is all in your air, plus you got a corn-row.
I'm just like a leprechaun, where's me pot of gold?
I'm trying to bust a million nuts before I get old.
Never telling my biz, though with the shit they discuss,
You never catch me under your blanket licking your shit up.
I treat a hoe like a slut, when she be acting stuck-up,
Coming with an attitude, Kamikaze don't give a fuck.
Orange Mound motherfuckers never loving these hoes,
North Memphis motherfuckers never loving these hoes,
South Memphis motherfuckers never loving these hoes,
East Memphis motherfuckers never loving these hoes.

[Chorus]

[M-Child]

I heard Trina was a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
I heard that Tosha was a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
I heard Tamaya was a dirty bitch, a dirty bitch,
I heard Ayza was a dirty bitch...
