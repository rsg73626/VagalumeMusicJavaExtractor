FOR WHAT WE WERE MADE

Do you know how many times I think about you?
Did you know this morning sun was shine for you?
you are my dream that come true
thats why tonigth I made all the stars shine for you

my songs never been so good
but is for you so if you like
that's ok for me than that's ok for you
you know I'm working hard
for you to stay by me side

but if anyway you go away
I will know that I do my best, babe
so I guess that's ok
love is complicated
we figth than we date
but in the end we know
for what we were made
