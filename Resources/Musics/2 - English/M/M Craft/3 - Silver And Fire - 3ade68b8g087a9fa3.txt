SILVER AND FIRE

Silver and fire burn in the night
There's nothing quite as beautiful as light
Deeper the waters, darker the flow,
Maybe this is everything i need to know
We drift in, we drift out of time
But why i would care for the hours that pass in a moment so sublime?

Nothing else matters
Nothing seems right
And there's nothing quite as beautiful as your light

Silver and fire burn in the day
Everything that mattered once is far away
Deeper the colours, darker the shades
That are woven in your tapestry, don't ever fade

We drift in, we drift out of view,
But why would i care for the world outside when i can hide away with you?

Nothing else matters
Nothing seems right
And there's nothing quite as beautiful as your light

Silver and fire burn in the night
I want you more than anything, i won't fight
For i am the silver, and you are the fire
Baby you're the only thing that can make me right

We drift in, we drift out of a dream
Why would we wanna hold on to what's real when it's falling apart at the seams?

Now nothing else matters
Nothing seems right
And there's nothing quite as beautiful as your light
There's nothing quite as beautiful as your light
