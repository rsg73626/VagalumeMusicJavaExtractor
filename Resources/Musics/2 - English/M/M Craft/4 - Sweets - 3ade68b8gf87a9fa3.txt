SWEETS

Little Magdalene, we all know about the places that you've been
You think you're hidden there but everyone has seen
And they can see you now you're out in the rain
It's five a.m. and you're on some corner again
Soaking wet and there's no taxi with your name, you say...


I take sweets from strangers
You got a car then let's take a ride
Wanna see some places
Wanna make some changes
Wanna do some living tonight
I'm not shy


Never unseen, you ventured out into the great in-between
The eucalyptus and the burnt gasoline
On dusty nowhere roads you hitch yourself a ride
With a burnt-down man who's eyes are still wide
And all that you can talk about is suicide, you say..


I take sweets from strangers
You got a car then let's take a ride
Wanna see some places
Wanna make some changes
Wanna do some living tonight
I'm not shy

Little Magdalene, we all know about the places that you've been
