LOVE KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT

Love Knows How To Fight: Lyrics
love knows how to fight 
love knows how to fight 
like darkness wrapped in light 
darkness wrapped in light 


and the sky is a roof made of tin with a million holes for the light to get in 
beyond, there's an endless sea of lucidity, and infinity of light 
and tonight for the first time in my life i'm gonna believe something is out there 
and there's somewhere i'm going to 


cause all of the satellites which circle way up high won't save me now 
and all of the meteorites that shoot across the sky won't save me now 
all of the galaxies that turn before my eye won't get me out 
out of this mess i'm in now, no nothing can save me now 


so if you wanna fuck up with a beer bottle in your hand then so do i 
and if you wanna cut up the blueprints and the plans then so do i 
you wanna get messed up, and make a final stand? well so do i 
cause i look around me and i see, nothing can save me now.. 


love knows how to fight 
love knows how to fight 
love knows how to fight 
and fight it will right up until the end 
love knows how to fight 


like darkness wrapped in light 
darkness wrapped in light 
but love knows how to fight 
love knows how to fight
