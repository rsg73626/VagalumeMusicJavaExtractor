DRAGONFLY

I can see it all tonight underneath a perfect sky
Where the universe revolves around the pupil of an eye
And infinities stretch out from infinities within
And I'm a part of everything, I'm a part of everything

Am I falling asleep? is it all just a dream?
Well, the cars are like water and the road is like a stream
Rolling down through the city, flowing out into the sea
Going nowhere like me, going nowhere like me

When the morning starts to glow out in the corners of the sky
And the people come, and the time just passes by
Then I'm only gonna see it from the corner of my eye
When the planet spins it sings like the wings of a dragonfly

I can see it all tonight
I can see it all tonight
I can see it all tonight
I can see it all tonight
