THE SOLDIER

What I would do to be close to you
What I would do for your love
I have been fighting in distant wars
You are the one I was thinking of.

What I would do to be there with you
What I would do for your kiss
I’ve been travelling in far-off lands
You are the only thing that I miss

Then the sound
Stretches out ahead
Time takes its time
If I don’t come back dead
I’m coming to make you mine

What I would do to be close to you
What I would do for your touch
I’ve been fighting these stupid wars
And Baby, I've wanted you so much

Then the sound
Stretches out ahead
Time takes its time
If I don’t come back dead
Then I’m coming to make you mine

What I would do for your love
What I would do for your love
What I would do for your love
What I would do for your love
For your love
