CLASSIC

[MED]
Game so easy when I wrote this
Reason they hate so hard maaan…
trade call cause their hand they fail all
separate weak from the strong
now your lawful god diggers never let girls evolve
separate law from the horn
street methods, reflection and there's no faith
beef hard to swallow with no taste
at least I die on my feet aint the feet no coward dared with a heartbeat
in park fleet hood in the tood with k ridge
madlib connect liam like babe ridge
same kids didn't hoop a loop this
can't stop hip hop since 86
ask you chick what's her favorite diss
don't hate when she mentioned this
classic

[Chorus]
timeless everlasting music next generation passing
hand melodies feel memories, flashing
tears to the laughing,
classic
blast through years still blasting j dill, tupac, time traveling
for the masses, black and latins turn it up, react with
classics

[Talib Kweli]
it's a honor and pleasure, i treasure bein the voice of the children of the lesser
god goin test ya – you gotta survive when they apply the pressure and give you a shock like a lie detector
where were you when they were passing out karma
don't let me black out on you, im blasting outta space like the astronaut farmer
cause the inner city grios is obsessed with the kilos
homie your range is shorter than danny devito
so aint nobody planning the sequel
jumping jack, land of the eagle
we go next level like show and AG
you get the picture clearer than slow motion on hd tis
i witnessed the death of the cd
liberate yourself from that format and be free
these dudes trying to be new instead of classic
you represent your block, my crew is intergalactic

[Chorus]
