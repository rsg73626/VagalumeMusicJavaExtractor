THE BALLAD OF ME

ive never fallen this hard for a girl before
i think i broke my legs when i hit the ground
i have idea of what i should do 
but of course like always i never knew

i have no idea of what i should do
so please would you drop me a fuckin clue
is it me you're lookin at
or is it--not him please don't tell me that
cause i like you so much that it hurts

oh please please will you tell me 
that you like me
there is nothing more that i want 
in the world more than for you to be my girl

i have no idea of what i should do
so please would you drop me a fuckin clue
is it me you're lookin at
or is it--not him please don't tell me that
cause i like you so much that it hurts

i have no idea of what i should do
so please would you drop me a fuckin clue
is it me you're lookin at
or is it--not him please don't tell me that
cause i like you so much that it hurts

i have no idea of what i should do
so please would you drop me a fuckin clue
is it me you're lookin at
or is it--not him please don't tell me that
cause i like you so much that it hurts
