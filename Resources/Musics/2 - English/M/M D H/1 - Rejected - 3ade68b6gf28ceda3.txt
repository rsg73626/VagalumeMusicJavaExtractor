REJECTED

I asked her out
said do you wanna go
to the movies
and she said no to me
she didn't even take her time
and I guess that was fine

I was rejected
whys life so complicated
I was rejected 
it just didn't work out
I was rejected
Not liked but not hated
I was rejected
better luck next time

at the dance
I had lots of fun
till that
first slow song came one
I walked up to her
and bult up my nerve
and asked the magic words

I was rejected
whys life so complicated
I was rejected 
it just didn't work out
I was rejected
Not liked but not hated
I was rejected
better luck next time

finally, two months later
I decided not to hate her
to ask her out
one more time
maybe then shed be mine
I found her
by her locker
talking to
her two best friends
this is it 
I thought
this is the end
if shes says no
we can maybe be friends

I built up my strength 
and then at great length
I uttered those 6 sick words
will you go out with me?

I was rejected
whys life so complicated
I was rejected 
it just didn't work out
I was rejected
Not liked but not hated
I was rejected
better luck next time
I was rejected
whys life so complicated
I was rejected 
it just didn't work out
I was rejected
Not liked but not hated
I was rejected
better luck next time
