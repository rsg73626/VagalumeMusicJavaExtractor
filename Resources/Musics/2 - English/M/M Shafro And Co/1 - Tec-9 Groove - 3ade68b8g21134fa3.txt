TEC-9 GROOVE

{hook}
Thats the way i like it
I like it when ya get real crazy
And thats the way i like it
I like it when you make me feel real good, good, good, good yeah

Come on, everybody listen up and let me do what i do
Yes, i'ma rock the mic and at the same time the chest, yeah
Im a dog i like to get nasty
Talk about a bitch and how she freaked all ova me
Shut up, listen up and let me tell you the deal
Like my nigga pimp daddy said "ya gots to be real"
Make a bitch ride that bone then ya leave her alone
But man first you gots to be a dog and dont forget to use a rubba
Ridin down the streets in my grey grand-pre
When i saw this nasty bitch that i met last week
I said, "get in my ride let me take ya for a spin
I wanna take ya to my house and just do you in"
I got 'em runnin, and shakin, and movin, and rollin, and hoppin and jumpin
But tec-9 just bounce, bounce, bounce
I got em run, and shake, and move, and roll, and hop and jump
But tec-9 just bounce, bounce, bounce
I say

Come on, where the fine sexy ladies? throw ya hands in the air
Swing them right to the left, like ya just dont care
Where the gangsta ass niggaz? are ya in the house?
Stand tall, watch ya back and keep a boot in ya mouth
Kickin it-kickin it on them hoes
Them dog ass hoes
I'm kickin it-kickin it-kickin it on them dog ass hoes
I'm kickin it-kickin it on them hoes who like to ride my dick
They ride, they ride they love to ride my dick
They ride, they ride they love to ride my dick
They ride, they ride they love to ride my dick
Kickin it-kickin it on them hoes
Them dog ass hoes
I'm kickin it-kickin it-kickin it on them dog ass hoes
I'm givin thanks to the niggaz who took me off the streets
My boy slim and baby open many doors fa me
I used to be a straight nigga sellin rocks on the set
Until they open my eyes and gave me the name tec
So sup, waddup now ya stuck so bump the sound of tec
Ya stupid clowns just bounce, bounce, bounce
Sup, waddup now ya stuck so bump the sound of tec
Ya stupid clowns just bounce, bounce, bounce
I got em runnin, and shakin, and movin, and rollin, and hoppin and jumpin
But tec-9 just bounce, boune, bounce
Run and shake and move and roll and hop and jump
But tec-9 just bounce, bounce, bounce
I say
