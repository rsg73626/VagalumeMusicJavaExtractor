WHAT SHE LIKES?

All aboard we're on our way
To this Party in the Milky Way
Sputniks hot and ready to explode
Following the brightest stars
We might see Venus, we might pass Mars
So come along, join the ride
Let's hit the solar road
Where's the moon now
We're lost in space
Where's the moon now
We've been lost for days
We're on a trip around the sun
With vodka, tractors and rock'n'roll
Food and drink for everyone
Rock'n'roll on the intercom
Havin' fun dancin' in the aisle
Travelin' around the stars
We're solar kings
Spaced out czars
I don't wanna see no moony face
Say cheese and flash a smile
Where's the moon now
We're lost in space
Where's the moon now
We've been lost for days
We're on a trip around the sun
With vodka, tractors and rock'n'roll
This is your captain, I'm Juri, your man
Laika and I are doing the best we can
There is a star we gotta find on the double
Before we run into Sirius trouble
