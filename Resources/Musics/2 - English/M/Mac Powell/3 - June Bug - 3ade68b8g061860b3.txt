JUNE BUG

June bug, june bug
Whacha gonna do bug
Tell me where you're going when the sun goes down
June bug, june bug
Do you wanna have fun
Come on over baby let me show you how

June bug grew up right down the road
Where I came from in a southern town
Good looking mama, hard working papa
Fell in love for the very first time

Well the way she walks
And the way she talks
Well I wanna be holdin her hand
With a pretty little smile
And her big blue eyes
June bug I wanna be your man

Well june bug she plays hard to get
And man I'll bet she'll break your heart
I won't give up on my june bug
I fell in love she's all I want

Well the way she walks
And the way she talks
Well I wanna be holdin her hand
With a pretty little smile
And her big blue eyes
June bug I wanna be your man

Well I don't know what I'm gonna do
To make her fall in love with me
Well I guess that I'm gonna have to prove
That I'm the only man that she's ever gonna need
Yeah!
