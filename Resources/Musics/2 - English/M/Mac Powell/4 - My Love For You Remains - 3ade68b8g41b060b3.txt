MY LOVE FOR YOU REMAINS

Looking at some pictures just the other day
Of all the years that have gome by
With my friends and my family
We laughed until we cried

Some things they are so different
Some things they never change
But of all the things that come
And go my love for you remains

I never realized how fast the time could fly
And then before you blink your eyes
Another year is gone
I never really knew
After all that we've been through
That I'd be more in love with you
With every day that dawns
But of all the things that
Come and go and change
My love for you remains

I can't believe that shirt I used to wear
I have forgotten how you wore your hair
Lookin' back it all just seems so funny now
But a-way back when you know
That then it was the style
Some things they are so different
Some things they never change
But of all the things that come
And go my love for you remains

I never realized how fast the time could fly
And then before you blink your eyes another year is gone
I never really knew
After all that we've been through
That I'd be more in love with you
With every day that dawns
But of all the things that come and go and change

Like the sun that's always a-risin'
Just like the stars that always shine
My love for you is never failin'
Even through the end of time
The end of time

I never realized how fast the time could fly
And then before you blink your eyes
Another year is gone
I never really knew
After all that we've been through
That I'd be more in love with you
With every day that dawns

But of all the things that
Come and go and change
My love for you remains
My love for you remains
Lookin' at some pictures just the other day
Of the years that have gone by
