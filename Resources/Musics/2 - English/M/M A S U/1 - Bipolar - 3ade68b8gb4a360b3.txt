BIPOLAR

I always on the run
I sat quiet in the sand
Watching as the world began to ramble
Force, forces that I believe

There's nothing I can't see
When everything I need, is inside me
But still we turn our head to the dreams
That one day will be flowers under the trees

And all our fears will end in laughter
All by my self, I will grow
By my self
Someday washes the pain and saves me

But I'll wait for those glorious summer days
