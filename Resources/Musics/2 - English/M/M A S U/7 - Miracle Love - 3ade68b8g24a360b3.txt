MIRACLE LOVE

I'm breaking this scene
Where nothing appears to be real
Why is everybody always doing the same things
I'm thinking of going extreme
So nobody steals what I feel
I'll cover myself with honest scars
I believe I can win it all

My eyes could never see this life
Without our miracle love
For all that I knew and though about you
And this miracle love
My eyes will never sleep tonight in this miracle love
But I still hunt you and dream about you
And this miracle love

I'm stealing the cheap, spending it in the streets
I was scare about, freak about it, hurt about it
Now it makes sense to me
Money is not what it seems
We just got twisted by fake human beings
So be free and just burn it all!
