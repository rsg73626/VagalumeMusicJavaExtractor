JESUS AND THE OUTLAWS

I've been feeling like a superstar
Been breaking all my laws
I've been preached by a band of thieves
Misguides by their needs

Oh Honey!
Give me money
So I can spend it in my suicide
Love? Honey? Just give me money
So I can spend it in my suicide

27 is my 33
Not a old man on his knees
All I wanted was ti be recognise
Equal to all forms of life

Oh Honey!
Give me money
So I can spend it in my suicide
Love? Honey? Just give me money
So I can spend it in my suicide

I promise I'll believe
If the world just let me be

There's only one thing there I need to know
Is the lord above, ready to take us home?

Lord let it shine
