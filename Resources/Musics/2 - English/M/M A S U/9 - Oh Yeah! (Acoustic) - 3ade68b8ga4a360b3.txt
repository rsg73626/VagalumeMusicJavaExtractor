OH YEAH! (ACOUSTIC)

What starts with emotions
Always ends with excuse
Now we're building illusions
For someone to defuse

Yeah we're giving our promises
We swore to never confuse
Now we start with a motive
And end up with a wound

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!

I tried to be honest
But honesty doesn't exist
I tried to invent it
But somebody stole it from me

So i lie!
