SHE IS MY DEVIL

She was braggain all the time
To all the woman passed her by
She loved the devil, he was her heart and soul

She's a serpent around her prays
She's the wine you'd die to taste
She's the proof that love in't safe

I still feel her flesh in my bones
She's always by my side in the road
As she kiss me, I'm driving fast
Unzipping her clothes... Ah!

I'm losing my mind, baby
I'm selling my soul
For one last kiss, baby
Your lips taste like home!
