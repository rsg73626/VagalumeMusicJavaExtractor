FALLIN STAR

I fell like a fallin star standing next to you
I dream about a broken heart, the joy of being used

At least I got my mama eyes and my daddys blues
If we stop to recognize we are born to rule

I fear even if we try we are doomed to lose
I breed enough to be a part of the things we do

At least I got my mama eyes and my daddys blues
If we stop to recognize we are born to rule
