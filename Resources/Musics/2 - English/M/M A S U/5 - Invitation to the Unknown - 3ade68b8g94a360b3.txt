INVITATION TO THE UNKNOWN

Moments can't get off
When treasure lost their thoughts
And the moons glimpse to the night
Stealing the breath of unclear signs

But you came with a wounded soul
And open up my world
Your soft touch heals my sleep
You froze my infinite dreams

But still we grow apart
Felt strange in unsteady hearts
We invited the unknown to fix our broken homes?

Time fails to succeed, so ease to unneeded
And the moon glimpse to the sun
All is lost when all is won?

But you came with a wounded soul
And open up my world
Your soft touch heals my sleep
You froze my infinite dreams
But still we grow apart
Felt strange in unsteady hearts
We invited the unknown to fix our broken homes?
