GHOST FAREWELL

In the days of blinded seas
farewell songs invades my dream
Where candles burn on the shores
They guide through open doors

Humm... this life seems so unreal

What's life without despair?
What's death without regrets?
I'll try to understand, expecting without a plain

Humm... this life seems so unreal
Humm... it guides through your skin

Love changes every year, changes with cursed fears
Hurts while it heals the ghosts, eternal, mortal and old

Humm... this life seems so unreal
Humm... it guides through your skin
