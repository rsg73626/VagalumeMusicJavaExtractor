OH YEAH!

What starts with emotions always ends with excuse
Now we're building illusions for someone to defuse
Yeah we're giving our promises, we swore to never confuse
Now we start with a motive and end up with a wound

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!

Down, down, down, everybody is going down
Move your body to this naked sound
We're all grooving, baby, we're all moving now
Let's make it our own
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, Now!
