WE HUNT FOR THE SUN

We hunt for the sun, we're the battles we've won
We decent from the gods, we're the losers, the future

We worship the lost, we fight in secret thoughts
We've conquered the pass, now we're bleeding and beating us down

If falling apart
Is breaking through your heart just say 
And stop staring at me

They come from the night
The last person inside of this empty arise
Its blinding and shinning

We plan for despare, they don't know, anywhere
Don't forget from mistakes, they don't move you
So move yourself out

If falling apart
Is breaking through your heart just say and stop staring at me

I feel like you want me to feel, so why can't I be the one
