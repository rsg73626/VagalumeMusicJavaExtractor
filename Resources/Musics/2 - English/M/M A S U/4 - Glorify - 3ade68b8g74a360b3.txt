GLORIFY

Thousand years of dust and dreams glow uninspired
Gather heroes and wake the seas, in light us with your fire

Glorify your words through your life
Glorify yourself through the night

Broken people, unfaithfull breed are drowning in their disguise
Hear them speaking and hear them flee
Falling out of time?

Glorify your words through your life
Glorify yourself through the fight

Teach your children to be free, hold them close and smile
Enrich the beauty of nature kiss, she rides with the tides

Glorify your words through your night
Glorify yourself through the fight
