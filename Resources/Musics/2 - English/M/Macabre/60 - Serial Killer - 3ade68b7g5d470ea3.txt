SERIAL KILLER

I'll thrill you; I'll kill you; cut your heart out
Then I'll dismember your body parts
I'll break in your house late at night
My smiling face is your final sight
I'll cut your throat with a razor blade
And leave you in a shallow grave
I'll pound your face against the fuckin' street
You'll love my work; It'll be complete
I'll strip you and rip you; your death is my game
I love my work and I have no shame
I'll pick you up when you're hitchhiking
Then you'll never be seen again
I'll cave in your head, Your face I'll distort
Then you'll end up as a "missing" report
I'll smash your skull with a two-by-four
Till your brains are on the floor
