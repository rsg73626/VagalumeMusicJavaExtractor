MR. ALBERT FISH (WAS CHILDREN YOUR FAVORITE DISH?)

He loved to hear the little kids scream
His instruments of hell did gleam
A box with a cleaver, saw and a knife
He used them to cut up their innocent lives

He took 12-year old Grace Budd home
And then he sawed right through her bones
With carrots and onions he made a stew
Her body parts was also used

With his fist in the air, he'd scream he was Christ
He'd do things to kids that weren't too nice
He'd lure them in and eat them up
Albert Fish, you were such a fucking nut
