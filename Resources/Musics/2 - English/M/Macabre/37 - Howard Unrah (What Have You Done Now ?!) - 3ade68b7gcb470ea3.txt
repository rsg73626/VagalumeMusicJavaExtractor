HOWARD UNRAH (WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW ?!)

He was an expert at shooting guns
In the army he had much fun
He had great aim and seldom missed
Killing the Nazi's as he made his death list

Howard Unrah what have you done now?
You took thirteen lives in twelve minutes time
Howard Unrah with your gun you
Shot thirteen down as you walked through the town

His neighbours gave him problems
While day after day he practiced with guns
They stole his new gate and that made him so pissed
That he gunned down the people on his SHITLIST

Howard Unrah what have you done now?
You took thirteen lives in twelve minutes time
Howard Unrah with your gun you
Shot thirteen down as you walked through the town
