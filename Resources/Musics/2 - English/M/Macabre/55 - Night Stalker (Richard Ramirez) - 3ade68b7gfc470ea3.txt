NIGHT STALKER (RICHARD RAMIREZ)

He will get you in the night
Then he'll take away your life
He's coming to your house with Satan in his head
Looking for a way in, while you're sleeping in your bed

Night Stalker - looking for
An unlocked window or door
Night Stalker looking for
An unlocked window or door

Through the window he will come
With his small caliber gun
Creeping through your house when there isn't any light
He's gonna wake you up with a bang in the night

Night Stalker - will delight
In killing you in the night
Night Stalker will delight
In killing you in the night

He will sneak up to your bed
Shoot your husband in the head
He'll beat and rape you while your husband slowly dies
And make you swear to Satan that you won't let out a cry

Night Stalker - will get you
Then he will murder you
Night Stalker will get you
Then he will murder you
