HITCHHIKER

My Parents Split
And Left The Home
They Left Me All Alone
To Fend For My Own
In The Ohio Home

There Was A Hitchhiker
Thumbing For A Ride
I Stopped My Olds
And He Got Inside
Drinking Beer At My House
He Didn't Realize
If He Tried To Leave
He'd Have To Die

Stalking For Someone Who's Walking
Someone That I Can Talk To
I See A Young Man
Thumbing With His Shirt Off
I'll Pick Him Up
And Take Him For A Ride

There Was A Hitchhiker
Thumbing For A Ride
I Stopped My Olds
And He Got Inside
Drinking Beer At My House
He Didn't Realize
If He Tried To Leave
He'd Have To Die

There Was A Hitchhiker
Thumbing For A Ride
I Stopped My Olds
And He Got Inside
Drinking Beer At My House
He Didn't Realize
If He Tried To Leave
He'd Have To Die
