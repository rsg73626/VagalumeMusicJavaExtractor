SNIPER IN THE SKY (CHARLES WHITMAN)

He killed his wife and mother, then packed up his supplies
Like food and guns and ammo, and went out taking lives
At the school observatory, he went to the top
And killed sixteen people, before he could be stopped

Charles Whitman was the school tower hitman
Charles Whitman shot at people and hit them
Charles Whitman had a brain tumor in his head
Charles Whitman was the cause of eighteen people's deaths

He kept on shooting people, the police they tried and tried
To kill Charles Whitman, the sniper in the sky
They finally snuck up on him, surprised him at the top
Then Charles Whitman was gunned down by a cop

Charles Whitman was the school tower hitman
Charles Whitman shot at people and hit them
Charles Whitman had a brain tumor in his head
Charles Whitman was the cause of eighteen people's deaths
