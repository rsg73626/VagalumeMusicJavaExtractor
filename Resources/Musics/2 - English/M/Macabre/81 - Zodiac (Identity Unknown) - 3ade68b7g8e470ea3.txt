ZODIAC (IDENTITY UNKNOWN)

This is the Zodiac speaking
I like killing people because it is so much fun
It is more fun than killing wild game in the forest
Because man is the most dangerous game of all to kill

You're going to die
There's no question about that
Who am I?
The killer called Zodiac
I'll just use my gun
Or maybe my knife
And then when I die
You'll be my slave in paradise

Well here I am again
The Zodiac man
And no one can figure out who I am
I send them clues
But they always lose
And they'll never find me
The meanies in blue

Something gives me the most thrilling experience
It's even better than getting your rocks off with a girl
The best part of it is that when I die I will be reborn in paradise
And those I have killed will become my slaves

You're going to die
There's no question about that
Who am I?
The killer called Zodiac
I'll just use my gun
Or maybe my knife
And then when I die
You'll be my slave in paradise

Well here I am again
The Zodiac man
And no one can figure out who I am
I send them clues
But they always lose
And they'll never find me
The meanies in blue

I will not give you my name
Because you will try to stop
Or slow down my collecting
Of slaves for my afterlife

Zodiac...
Zodiac...
Zodiac...
