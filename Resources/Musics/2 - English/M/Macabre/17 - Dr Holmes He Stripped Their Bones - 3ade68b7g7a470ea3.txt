DR HOLMES HE STRIPPED THEIR BONES

Just call me Dr. Holmes
I'd like to strip your bones 
But first I'm going to kill you
Inside of my black hotel
I'll gas you in your bedroom
I'm going to take your life soon

[Chorus:]

Dr. Holmes he stripped their bones
To medical students their skeletons he sold
He melted their flesh in acid bath
And sold their bones in classified ads
I want you to work for me
But don't tell anybody
Just come to my black hotel
And bring me all your money
I'll put you in my lime pit
Your life I'm going to end it

[Chorus]
