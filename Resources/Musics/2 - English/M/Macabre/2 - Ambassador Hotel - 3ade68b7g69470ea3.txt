AMBASSADOR HOTEL

Jeffrey Went Down To The
Ambassador Hotel
With A Young Man That He Didn't Know Too Well
And When He Awoke He Found The Young Man Laying Dead
And The Thought Of A Suitcase Popped Into Jeffrey's Head

He Flagged Down A Taxi Back To His Grandma's Place
With The Help Of The Driver Loaded The Man In The Suitcase
Then When His Grandma Went To Church On Sunday
He Dismembered The Man
And He Threw Him Away
