MONTREAL MASSACRE (MARK LUPINE)

Mark went out with his rifle
To the University of Montreal
Divided up a classroom
And then shot only girls

Mark Lupine
Killed fourteen
In Montreal
He only shot girls

He must have hated women
To do what he did
He divided up a classroom
And the females lives he did end

Mark Lupine
Killed fourteen
In Montreal
He only shot girls
