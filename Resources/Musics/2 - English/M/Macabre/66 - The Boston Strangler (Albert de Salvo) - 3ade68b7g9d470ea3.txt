THE BOSTON STRANGLER (ALBERT DE SALVO)

He's walking through apartment halls
For a female he will end it all
He'll take her nylon stockings down
And her neck they'll go around

You can't untangle her
From the Boston Strangler
He's going to mangle her
The Boston Strangler

The police can't find him; several dead
They're looking for the man they dread
He will shove a broomstick up her cunt
Around her neck, a strangler's knot

You can't untangle her
From the Boston Strangler
He's going to mangle her
The Boston Strangler
