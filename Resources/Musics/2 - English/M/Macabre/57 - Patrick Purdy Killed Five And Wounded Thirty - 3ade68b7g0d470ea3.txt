PATRICK PURDY KILLED FIVE AND WOUNDED THIRTY

My name is Patrick Purdy
And I have a duty
To kill as many children
As I can
So it's off to school
Where I used to go
With my AK-47
In my hands

Patrick Purdy
Thought he was doing his duty
Thought he was in the army
And the children was his enemy
Patrick Purdy
Killed five and wounded thirty
His tactics were quite dirty
The children's blood was squirting
