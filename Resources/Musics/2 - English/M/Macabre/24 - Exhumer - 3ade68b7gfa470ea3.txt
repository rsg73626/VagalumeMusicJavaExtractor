EXHUMER

My favourite thing to do
Is to dig bodies from the grave
I'm sure that you can see
That I'm sickening and crazed
Walking through the graveyard
With a shovel in my hand
Looking for a grave
I'm an exhumer of the dead

I'm digging up your grave
With a smile on my face
I'm sure you know my status
I'm a sickening disgrace
Taking off your jewellery
And having such a ball
I'll take it to the pawnshop
And I'll sell it fuckin' all
