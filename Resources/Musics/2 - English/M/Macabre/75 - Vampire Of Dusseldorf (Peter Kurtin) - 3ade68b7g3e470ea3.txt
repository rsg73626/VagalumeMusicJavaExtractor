VAMPIRE OF DUSSELDORF (PETER KURTIN)

I need a victim to do things sickening
I just want to make you bleed
My knife is gashing your blood is splashing
To see your blood is what I need

I'm gonna strangle you and I'll slit your throat too
I love to see your blood run, that's the thing that makes me cum
I'm gonna kill you just because I want to
I'm the Vampire of Dusseldorf and I will cut your life short

My hands are choking my knife is broken
An orgasm is what I need
Your blood is spilling the sight is thrilling
To cum I need to see you bleed

I'm gonna strangle you and I'll slit your throat too
I love to see your blood run, that's the thing that makes me cum
I'm gonna kill you just because I want to
I'm the Vampire of Dusseldorf and I will cut your life short
