HEY LAURIE DANN

Hey Laurie Dann where ya going
With those guns in your hand?

I'm going round to shoot young children
I just can't cope with the world were in

Hey Laurie Dann I heard you shot
Those young children down

Yes I did, I shot 'em
You should have seen them hit the ground

I took my guns and I shot 'em
Hey Laurie Dann where ya gonna run to now?

I'm going to a house that's not too far away

I'm gonna shoot one more
Then take my own life away
