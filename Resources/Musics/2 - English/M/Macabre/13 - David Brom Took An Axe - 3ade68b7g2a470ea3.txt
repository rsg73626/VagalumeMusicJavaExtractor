DAVID BROM TOOK AN AXE

He took an axe
And then attacked
And away at his family
He began to hack
His dad wouldn't let him
Listen to a hardcore band
So here comes David
With an axe in his hand

David Brom killed his dad
His mother and brother and sister
He took an axe to their heads
David Brom he killed his dad
His mother and brother and sister
Took an axe to their heads

They were sitting there
And David came in
Then he axed them
Again and again
Now his family
Is all dead
David came down
With an axe on their heads

David Brom killed his dad
His mother and brother and sister
He took an axe to their heads
David Brom he killed his dad
His mother and brother and sister
Took an axe to their heads
