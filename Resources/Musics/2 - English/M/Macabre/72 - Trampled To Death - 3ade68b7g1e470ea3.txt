TRAMPLED TO DEATH

You went to see the Who
And the people there trampled you
You were underneath their shoes
There was nothing you could do

Trampled to death at the concert
They never left alive
Underneath the stomping feet
Eleven crushed as they screamed and died
They paid to see the Who
But actually they paid to die
As they ran to their seats
They were trampled and pulverized

They didn't hear the screams
At the concert of their dreams
They were worried about good seats
Not the lives under their feet

Trampled to death at the concert
They never left alive
Underneath the stomping feet
Eleven crushed as they screamed and died
They paid to see the Who
But actually they paid to die
As they ran to their seats
They were trampled and pulverized
