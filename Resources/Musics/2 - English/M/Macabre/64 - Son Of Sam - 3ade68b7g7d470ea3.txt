SON OF SAM

I am Sam; Sam I am
I would not like green eggs and ham
I am Sam; Son of Sam
With my 44 in hand

You're gonna be dead when I shoot you in the head
There's no time to cry, now it's time to die

My father has told me to kill you
And that's just what I'm going to do
I have a gun and I'm insane
I'll make your life go down the drain

You're gonna be dead when I shoot you in the head
There's no time to cry, now it's time to die

I am Sam; death in hand
I would not like green eggs and ham
I am Sam; Son of Sam
Your life is a flash within my hand

You're gonna be dead when I shoot you in the head
There's no time to cry; it's time to fuckin' die
