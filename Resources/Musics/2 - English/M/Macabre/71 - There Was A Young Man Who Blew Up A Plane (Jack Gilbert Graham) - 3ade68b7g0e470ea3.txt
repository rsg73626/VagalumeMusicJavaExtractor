THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO BLEW UP A PLANE (JACK GILBERT GRAHAM)

There was a young man who blew up a plane
He blew up the plane for personal gain
I guess he was insane

There was a young man who planted a bomb
He planted a bomb on his mom
He planted the bomb to blow up the plane
He blew up the plane for personal gain
I guess he was insane

There were forty four people who got on the plane
They got on the plane then they were slain
By the young man who planted the bomb
He planted the bomb on his mom
He planted the bomb to blow up the plane
He blew up the plane for personal gain
I guess he was insane

The judge and jury showed no remorse
He's dead of course
