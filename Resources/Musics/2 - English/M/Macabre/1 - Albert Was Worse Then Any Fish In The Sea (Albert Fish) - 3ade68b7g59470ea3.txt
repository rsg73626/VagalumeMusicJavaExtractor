ALBERT WAS WORSE THEN ANY FISH IN THE SEA (ALBERT FISH)

Fish seemed like a nice old man and people believed his lies
But Albert was a child eating shark in disguise

Albert was worse than any fish in the sea
He killed and ate young children and enjoyed it immensely
Albert a child eating Fish was he
Who devoured the flesh of kids because he thought it was tasty

The land was Albert's ocean; Fish consumed his helpless prey
He would have ate more kids but they caught him and made Fish fillet

Albert was worse than any fish in the sea
He killed and ate young children and enjoyed it immensely
Albert a child eating Fish was he
Who devoured the flesh of kids because he thought it was tasty
