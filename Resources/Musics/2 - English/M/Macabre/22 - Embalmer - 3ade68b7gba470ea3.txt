EMBALMER

I am - the embalmer
And it's nice to meet you
Now's my - chance to
Get to know you better
Now you're - lying
There upon my table
And it's - time to
Prepare you for embalming

Embalmer
Embalms you
Embalmer
Embalms you
Embalmer - embalms you
Embalmer - embalms youuuuuuuuu

Yes it's - nice to
Have you in my parlour
As I - vacuum
Out all your fluids
You're still - lying
There upon my table
And it's - time to
Inject the embalming fluid

Embalmer
Embalms you
Embalmer
Embalms you
Embalmer - embalms you
Embalmer - embalms youuuuuuuuu
