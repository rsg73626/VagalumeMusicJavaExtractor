I NEED TO KILL

Coming to your house
I'll make you scream
Catch you all alone and
Then you're dead
I'm going to shatter
All your dreams
Filling you all full of
Fear and dread

Catch you by surprise
Your death will make me smile
You know it makes me feel so good
When your life expires
It's time to realize
That you're going to die
There's nothing you can do
Even if you try

Murder is a wicked
Fuckin' disease
But it makes me
Feel so good inside
Killing you to
Satisfy my needs
Showing no remorse for
Taking human life

Catch you by surprise
Your death will make me smile
You know it makes me feel so good
When your life expires
It's time to realize
That you're going to die
There's nothing you can do
Even if you try

I'm going to tie you
To a tree
Then I'll put a wire
Around your neck
Pulling it as tight
As it can be
Your head and body
I will disconnect

Catch you by surprise
Your death will make me smile
You know it makes me feel so good
When your life expires
It's time to realize
That you're going to die
There's nothing you can do
Even if you try
