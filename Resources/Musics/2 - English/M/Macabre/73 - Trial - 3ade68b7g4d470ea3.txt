TRIAL

From A Hallway Mirror I Saw Him
As He Drank From The Water Fountain
Then Jeffrey Walked Into The Courtroom
With A Tight Suit That Was Dark Blue
Ten Feet Away The Cannibal Contained

I Went To See Jeffrey Dahmer's Trial
To See The Man That Committed The Acts Most Vile
To Hear Some Of The Testimony
And Listen To What The Witnesses Say

I Waited In Line To See Him
Through The Bulletproof Wall
In The Courtroom
And I Had A Seat In The Front Row
