RAT MAN

The day he got bit by a rat
He wanted to kill all the cats
His hair it turned grey on that day
He then grew a tail and some fangs

He's not batman
He's the ratman
Rabies foaming
From his mouth, yeah!

And now he looks just like a rat
He's killing and eating the cats
He's out on the streets every night
You'd better stay out of his sight

He's not batman
He's the ratman
Rabies foaming
From his mouth, yeah!
