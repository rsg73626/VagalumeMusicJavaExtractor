EDMOND KEMPER HAD A HORRIBLE TEMPER ( EDMOND KEMPER )

At the age of fifteen he murdered his grandparents
They put him away for only seven years
He hated his mother who worked at the college
So he picked up young hitchhiking co ed's and cut off their heads

Edmond Kemper had a horrible temper
He cut off young girls heads and took them home to bed

He'd pick up co ed girls to give them a ride
Then bring them to the forest at gun point
Edmond then would stab them and sever off their heads
He'd take the heads home and have sex with them

Edmond Kemper had a horrible temper
He cut off his mothers head as she read there in the bed
