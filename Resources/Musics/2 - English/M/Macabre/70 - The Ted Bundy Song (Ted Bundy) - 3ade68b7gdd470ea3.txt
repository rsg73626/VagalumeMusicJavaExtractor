THE TED BUNDY SONG (TED BUNDY)

Here's a story of Ted Bundy
Murdered young girls Monday through Sunday
Lure them into his car
Then they wouldn't see tomorrow

He killed Monday through Sunday
His name was Ted Bundy
He murdered young girls
And left them in the woods

He would get them in his car
They wouldn't go far
He would hit them in the head
With an object until they were dead

Murdered young girls in several states
From jail two times he escaped
Until the end he denied his crimes
He was convicted, then he fried

He killed Monday through Sunday
His name was Ted Bundy
He murdered young girls
And left them in the woods
