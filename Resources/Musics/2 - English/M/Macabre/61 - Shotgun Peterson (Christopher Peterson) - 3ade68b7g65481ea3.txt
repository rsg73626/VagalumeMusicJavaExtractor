SHOTGUN PETERSON (CHRISTOPHER PETERSON)

Halloween
This is no trick or treat
When I squeeze the trigger
I'll make you look like swiss cheese

Shotgun Peterson
Took his scattergun
Shot some people down
In Indiana towns

Your lives mean nothing
You're like clay pigeons to me
Killing you with my twelve gauge
Is just like shooting skeet

Shotgun Peterson
Took his scattergun
Shot some people down
In Indiana towns
