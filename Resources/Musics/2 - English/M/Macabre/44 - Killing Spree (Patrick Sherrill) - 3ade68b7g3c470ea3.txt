KILLING SPREE (PATRICK SHERRILL)

Bullets spraying, people praying
Show no mercy, evil slaying
Bodies flying, many dying
No escaping, relatives crying

The lead flies free
For what you've done to me
I'll shoot you with my gun
When you try to run

There's nowhere to hide
You're all locked inside
As you act dead in silence
I rage with violence

Shells ejecting, thoughts reflecting
Contemplating suicide
Put the gun against my head
Pull the trigger now I'm dead

The lead flew free
For what you did to me
I shot you with my gun
When you tried to run

There was nowhere to hide
You were all locked inside
As you played dead in silence
I raged with violence
