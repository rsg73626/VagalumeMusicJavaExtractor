ANDERSON'S

[Intro]

This song is for "Him"
"He" to which I belong
One and only...
The Love of My Life

I need to know where you are
If not here inside me
Lost in a world of hatred and lies
Away from your love
Without you there is an error
Because you're already part of me

I can not live life without you
Spend days, hours, and I still want to see you
Painful are the moments that I'm not on your side
I would do anything, anything to have you here
My only love

I'll Break the Obstacle
Take the stones of the path
For you to follow me
'll take on the lap, and we will be kings
You and I, and so
Forever Belong Together

Maybe you sin to me
But I know that everyone is wrong
You're one and Only
And will be remembered forever
Eternalized
Carry you with me
All my life
You and I, and so
Forever Belong Together

Forever, 
Forever, 
Forever Belong Together

I can not live life without you
Spend days, hours, and I still want to see you
Painful are the moments that I'm not on your side
I would do anything, anything to have you here
My only love

Since I do not know who I am
I just know to whom I belong
You will always be mine, and I his
And so, Forever...
We Belong Together
