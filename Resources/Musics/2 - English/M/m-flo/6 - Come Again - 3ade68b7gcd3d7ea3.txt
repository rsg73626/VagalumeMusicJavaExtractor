COME AGAIN

It's friday i want to play,
On saturday don't want to stay, at home
Thinking of you so let me party all night long,
It's friday i want to play,
On saturday don't waste no more time on you
Thiking of you so let me party all night long

Oh nando mo, chakushin no chekku shitemitemo you won't appear
Oh kotchi kara kaketemo ii kedo, my pride gets in the way

My friends keep telling me you ain't good for me
Like "anna yatsu hottokina"
"girl there's so much to see"
Ii hito ni deau chansu wa arushi

Kin'youbi no sukara ni kimi wo wasure ni, odoriakasu yo, kon'ya
I'll sing you this song, todoku you ni
Setsunai merodi- ni namida shinai you ni ku-ru ni ne
Odoritsuzukesasete, ne-, dj won't you come again
Furoa- wo motto atsuku, hibikasete
Yeah, asa made mawashitsuzukete,
Kaeritakunai kara tomenaide

Bring it to ya live chokutsuu kore astro
Shireteru hazu, mou iwazu to ever since hatsutoujou
Mimi kara hanareru koto ne- flow
From the kassouro, bow! juudan
Totsunyuu arayuru kuukan, arayuru shouhasuu
Invasion stere-ere-o-phonic geijitsu so tell me who da...
Rokuban doru no hyu-man chillin on my soratobu juutan
M-flo crew is the shuudan keepin clubs more soshiaru than afuro
Kyuu-ban tokashitekuze michi fuusa
Suru yatsura, ketobasu kore shuukan
Ain't nuthin to it, damarazu naku ko
Torimaki kutchau furonto auto

This mic is live(wire) live(wire)l ive(wire)
This flow is live(wire) live(wire) live(wire)
Dj is live(wire) live(wire) live(wire)
The floor is live(wire) live(wire) live(wire)

Uh konna ni, mattetemo kimi ni diss sarerushi
Uh tsumaranai kankei naraba, why don't you let me go

My friends keep telling me i should find someone
Tsumetakunatte, yasashii
A special one who'd treat you respectfully,
Datte sore ga futsuu dashi

Yonaka sugiru koro ni wa, kimi yori hoka no suteki na hito to, kon'ya
We'll sing you this song, sou, sunao ni
Yorisou futari, karada ga kanjirumama ni ne
Odoritsuzukesasete, ne-, dj won't you come again
Furoa- wo motto atsuku, hibikasete
Yeah, asa made mawashitsuzukete, kaerutakunai kara tomenaide

Okurennayo, get down get down to the floor, party people
Until the (hoot! hoot!) pi-po- pi-po-
Come to bumrush the eigyou seisou shite fiesuta
Uesutan bou ni poriesuta- shatsu, eri dake kyodai
Check the suni-ka- no sozai
Wanigawa, i'm the man of the hour
Kimitachi biri, like jean and not my
Lover, shabadaba, it's past eleven
Furisubi- ni suruze, wakku na sara
Your style's cheesy and gay, dakara it's chi-kama
I blanky jet through your city kyou wa satade-
Yo the joint gets dumb and dumber

Odoritsuzukesasete, ne-, dj won't you come again
Furoa- wo motto atsuku, hibikasete
Yeah, asa made mawashitsuzukete,
Kaerutakunai kara tomenaide

It's friday i want to play,
On saturday don't want to stay, at home
Thinking of you so let me party all night long,
It's friday i want to play,
