CHRONOPSYCHOLOGY

* Mister, hey won't you be mine
Kakemeguru kurayami no naka
Itsuka my heart will shine bright
This time, you better be mine
Tamashii ga sakebidasu ima
Shizuka ni place your lips to mine

Tsuki no hikari wo abinagara ohoshisama to hanasu ichiban juu
Chinmoku no RIZUMU ni norinagara odorikuruu watashi wo mite warau anata
My mind keeps playing tricks on me mou anata ga inai kara
Tell me, am I just crazy? Hada ni kizamu wa, your name

Nobody knows where I've been, all the troubles I have seen
Kanashimi kara no nigemichi wa tada hitotsu dake...
Nobody knows my misery & what is dear to me...

* repeat

Anata ga kami wo tooshitaku shi wo taiyou ni mukete tonaeru no suru to
Kikoete kuru you na inai hazu no anata no ashioto
I sing myself a modern day blues, warai koraete
I close my eyes so I can see nemuru anata no yokogao

What a dream, can't believe, this craziness happened to me
Kako ni furikaeru koto naku susumitai keredo...
Reality ain't what it seems, so won't you tell it to me...

Mister, hey won't you be mine
Kakemeguru kurayami no naka
Itsuka my heart will shine bright
This time, I'll make you feel right
Tamashii ga sakebidasu ima
Shizuka ni place your lips to mine

This atmospheric barrier is torn through
People flaunt supernatural styles, it's Spawn 2
Yo, nanatsu no mugendai no SAIZU choushizen kai no mae no sedai no sonzai
Yo who can pantomime this arashi no maebure
Afureru shakunetsu no stunts, I'm bitin' bullets
Bakuzen tobashi ni kitaze to rip the scene

Partner, it's hard to imagine this MAJI ni
I modulate your frequency and we zenshin
with three engines, propellin' them to outer limits
Kono shinri jou de maigo
I control, gravity, it's vertigo
