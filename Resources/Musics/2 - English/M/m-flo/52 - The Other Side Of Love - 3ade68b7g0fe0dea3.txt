THE OTHER SIDE OF LOVE

*1  In my heart, I know I must be right
@Darkest shadows will someday come to light
@I've been down, but I can rise above
@I keep searching for the other side of love

@Looking for fun was just a game to me
@Never knew what each lonely day would bring
@Now I'm so tired of trying to run away
@I've got to find a love that's here to stay

*2  In my heart, I know the day will come
@We'll be laughing and dancing in the sun
@What I've found has never been enough
@I keep searching for the other side of love

@I always heard that love's supposed to be
@More than a word and more than just a dream
@Someone to share your every joy and pain
@Someone who's there for sunshine and the rain
@
@She wanna take it to other side of love and I cannot deny this girl
@She got somethin in her eyes you know that all I see is something hot!
@It's like she play with fire
@And if I tell you I don't care, then I'd be lyin'
@Love it or leave it., the way she is it's like she gotta just
@Have it or squeeze it... looking for love in all the wrong places
@Help is needed... nobody taught her how to fly
@Another sad story in another sad city, see why

@I know what I see
@I see exactly how it'll be
@He'll be strong enough to be kind
@He won't need to be tough to know he's mine

@And I must believe what I feel
@I'll feel it deep inside when it's real
@And I know when day is done
@He'll be so close to me that we'll be one
@On the other side of love..

@Girl,the first time we met was through some mutual friends and
@I never thought of nothin' cuz you treated me like the rest of them
@But you stepped to me,askin' for my phone mail
@Takin 'bout you wanna send me pictures from the party
@That's the start of the long tale supposed to be short-lived
@Wanderin' if I should ever even have wrote this
@Cuz you have celebrity status life and
@I'm together with a girl soon to be my wifey
@With every call and every talk,your feeling's got more strong,
@I guess... I could tell from the look
@She wanna take it to the other side(the other side)
@Knowin' that it's gotta be a hell of a ride
@She wanna take it to the other side(the other side)
@Knowin' that it's gotta be a hell of a ride
