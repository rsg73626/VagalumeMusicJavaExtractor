I wanna dance my dance and sing this song
Deforuto saretai no all night long
Tell me, baby, where we're going
Kimochi ga inside out
I wanna dance your dance and sing that song
Kako no memorii shoukyo all night long
Doushite baby, going crazy
Sekai ga upside down

What's that noise ...what's that noise...
See the people (people) jumping (jumping)
Music (music) bumpin' (bumpin')
What's that noise, (she said) what's that noise?
Feel the denpa (denpa) danger (danger)
Can I (can I) kick it

O-o-outta control, yeah, she?s so
Bass is horny, me so
Mechakucha odotte sawagou sawagou
She said get your freak on
Abunasou, demo rigou
She's a yoru no amiigo
Undercover lover wanna dance
So minna shuugou

I wanna dance my dance and sing this song
Deforuto saretai no all night long
Tell me, baby, where we?re going
Kimochi ga inside out
I wanna dance your dance and sing that song
Kako no memorii shoukyo all night long
Doushite baby, going crazy
Sekai ga upside down

I'm hotter than a vol-vol-vol-vol-vol-vol-vol-cano
And I'm about to blow up-up-up-up
Cuz it?s none of your business 
nuh-uh-uh-uh (nope), nuh-uh-uh-uh (nope), nuh-uh-uh-uh (nope)
Datte watashi no kattedakara-uh
Iya nara kono mama get out-out-out-out of my way (my way)
Mirai e (mirai e) susumu shika nai babe (nai babe)
Kaisei (yup) kaishi (yup) we out (check) okaikei !

Uninstall, everything
Uso darake dakara
World is mine
Me no mae subete ga bright

Dive into the night
Feel the electricity
Dive into the night
Into the night

1, 2, 3 !

I wanna dance my dance and sing this song
Deforuto saretai no all night long
Tell me, baby, where we?re going
Kimochi ga inside out
I wanna dance your dance and sing that song
Kako no memorii shoukyo all night long
Doushite baby, going crazy
Sekai ga upside down

She's so outta control, 
You gotta love the way she uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
She?s so outta control, 
You gotta love the way she uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
