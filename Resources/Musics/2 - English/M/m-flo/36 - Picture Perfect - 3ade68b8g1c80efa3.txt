PICTURE PERFECT

Yeah,
Monkey Majik,
m-flo,
You already know.
Kyoudai from Sendai.
Let's go.
All the time that you were standing by my side.
Yeah, she's that picture perfect kind.
I can't believe I was so blind.
Do you remember that time?
I know I stepped across that line.
I made cry and that's my crime.
I wish that I could just rewind.
It's the evening, and you've been complaining.
'Bout the situations and all my deceiving.
I know that everythings going slo-o-o-o-o-ow, yeah.
But if you want to feel better,
I can tell you that it's gonna be great,
it's gonna be good.
Oh, but, oh, but I'd be lying to you. (I was so blind.)
But these days I'm changing,
Meeting new faces.
How am I supposed to be?
And my feelings for you seem to be changing.
Looking back,
I don't look back on me.
All the time that you were standing by my side.
Yeah, she's that picture perfect kind.
I can't believe I was so blind.
Do you remember that time?
I know I stepped across that line.
I made cry and that's my crime.
I wish that I could just rewind.
Yeah, yeah.
Inakute mo ii,
I wanted to be free.
Inakunatte mo ii,
I wanted her to leave.
It's kind of hard to see,
when the world tunnel-visioned me.
Motometeta ai no katachi.
They say believe in what you can't see,
Demo mawari no candy ga sweet de hard to think.
Atama de wa comprehend shite mo koudou ni utsu,
Set my eyes on the rikutsu, the truth's here, listen
Chase shite mo, chase shite mo, things keep fleeting.
Hen na yume miteta, I must have been sleeping.
tooku samayou mae ni chikaku wo seek it.
Yoku mite mireba kokoro ni wa beacon
of lights sashite, sagashiteta thing's here
Omotta yori near, close to your hemisphere
ima de wa clear 20/20 'cause I'm a share subete
and I don't care if the think I'm weird.
There, there, nobody thinks you weird, you see,
I've been through it all,
the same thing happened to me,
Kinishinai, "wounds heal with time"
But in the meanwhile,
I'm a show you what I mean.
Let's think of it another way,
Everything we do and say defines who we are,
as we live out each day.
What we did was wrong in time,
but helps us go back and rewind.
It's a mistake, but it ain't no crime,
kasanariau no so tsumari sore ga ai.
All the time that you were standing by my side.
Yeah, she's that picture perfect kind.
I can't believe I was so blind.
Do you remember that time?
I know I stepped across that line.
I made cry and that's my crime.
I wish that I could just rewind.
I said goodbye,
I didn't know
that it would all turn out this way.
But now I know,
I've realized, that I can learn from my mistakes.
But these days I'm changing,
meeting new faces.
How am I supposed to be?
And my feelings for you seem to be changing.
Looking back,
I don't look back on me.
All the time that you were standing by my side.
Yeah, she's that picture perfect kind.
I can't believe I was so blind.
Do you remember that time?
I know I stepped across that line.
I made cry and that's my crime.
I wish that I could just rewind.
Monkey Majik,
from Sendai to the world.
You already know. (yeah.)
