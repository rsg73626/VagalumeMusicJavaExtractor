L.O.T. (LOVE OR TRUTH)

Love or Truth
Love or Truth

Like the wind, it keeps movin' on
Kotae nante nai kedo
It isn't fair, the way you want me to be
Setsunai SUPAISU ga hitsuyou

Love or truth, This is what I prove, between me & you
Love or truth, whichever you choose, it's for me & you

Baby, don't you fade away
Kawaranai mono wa nani mo nai kara
Nagare no mama ni uketomeyou yo
Take it as you wish to be kotoba ni naranai koi mo aru kara
Love or truth

Oboeteru ka? When I used to dance with the devil
Dou itta kaze no fukimawashi naze sou...
Ara kure kaeri wa yonaka netsuki okireba
Hi ga kure kimagure ai sareteta jikaku nee
You used to fascinate me
Risou no IMEEJI when you sang for me
Kirei ni but lately roku ni atte nai
been having sleepless nights
Uragitta kitai
Nani wo motometa no ka wanted to be one of the
Masaka to iwaseru man to be
Kitsukeba midareta sugata
Kimi ni mikasanakatta ore warukatta
Tsumetaku naru bakari chokusetsu semezu ni
Bujoku shiau hibi ga tsuzuki
You know the way, you & I gotta be
Furimawasareru na yo kotoba ni

Baby, words get in the way
Itsuka natsukashii keshiki ni deatte
Omoidashitara yasashiku nareru
Then you'll realize & see ai to shinjitsu wa hitotsu ni nareru

In the skies, we'll never see no limits
Sore wa dare ni mo wakaranai
It's what you say, that makes me keep believing in
Kokyuu suru you na aijou

It was like a start of a new day...
Hitori ayumi seisei shiteta koro
Shirazu ni I was gettin' older
Mae mo ushiro mo darkness
Kurayami hai tsukubari sagashi
Motometeta kotoba de sae motomoto machigae
Hikari nai basho ni shiawase aru wake nai
Mishiranu chi de au mishiranu hito
you know the sequel kaeranu kako
To my one & only love otona no me kara
Mitara tada no BAKA can you remember
Me wo hakari mezawari wo koto shi
Mitashikirenakatta tamashii no kawaki
I gotta love myself before I love others
Yuresare yurushiau to work it out
I gotta love myself before I love others
Yurusare yurushiau let's work it out

Love or truth, This is what I prove, between me & you
Love or truth, whichever you choose, it's for me & you

Baby, don't you fade away
Kawaranai mono wa nani mo nai kara
Nagare no mama ni uketomeyou yo
Take it as you wish to be kotoba ni naranai koi mo aru kara

Baby, words get in the way
Itsuka natsukashii keshiki ni deatte
Omoidashitara yasashiku nareru
Then you'll realize & see ai to shinjitsu wa hitotsu ni nareru

Love or Truth
