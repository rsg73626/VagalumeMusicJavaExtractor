SHE LOVES THE CREAM

m-flo loves DOPING PANDA - She loves the CREAM

She wants the CREAM
She loves the CREAM
She needs the CREAM
She gets the CREAM

Rocks and Mercedes... what she wants
But she's no lady... you know that
What got you jaded?... my oh my
I think it's too late cuz... she can't stop

She wants the CREAM
She loves the CREAM
She needs the CREAM
She gets the CREAM

It ain't no fun when she eats your funds
And when she's all done then she's out for the hunt
NEXT! Y'all better run because
Like Nelly Furt she's a man-eater
Got a little change then she will shake ya
Ching-a-ling-a-ling, YUP! Best believe that
Out from the left, right pockets be flat
Crazy how she make you weak on your knee-caps

Cuz I know... I know you will... I know you will
She does it for the thrill of it
I know you will
She'd rub up on the gentleman, telling him she likes to get serious
Ya best believe the light
Cuz I know... I know you will... I know you will
It all starts with a little bit
I know you will
Her eyes so twinkly, the bite so venomous, she's killin em
Ya best believe the light
Cuz I know... I know you will... I know you will
Now she all up in your house, man
Using up your cards and fillin your garages
Down by law, no doubt she's a veteran
Ya best believe the light
Cuz I know... I know you will... I know you will
She's killin em she's killin em...
Ya best believe the light

Rocks and Mercedes... what she wants
But she's no lady... you know that
What got you jaded?... my oh my
I think it's too late cuz... she can't stop

Rocks and Mercedes... what she wants
But she's no lady... you know that
What got you jaded?... my oh my
I'll see you later... Bye Bye Bye

She wants the CREAM
She loves the CREAM
She needs the CREAM
She gets the CREAM
