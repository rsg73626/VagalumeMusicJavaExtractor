A.D.D.P

D'you remember when we both were so young
Playing games was innocent and fun
And now that things were said and done
I realize that you are my world

There were things that I tojikomete
kizutsukeau words misled
And now I'm ready to confess
what is deep inside of my heart

I wanna be where ever you are
I wanna be your shining star
I wanna be close to your heart
itsuka, Let me into your heart

If you want my love
ima kara demo there's never too much
Satisfy my heart
yorisou toki ni, subete you'll see

Analyze, Dissect, Detect, Process

He said, "She said," but it don't mean a thing
Cuz what we have is so much more than a fling
And like the flowers in the Spring
I'm ready to kokoro wo hiraite

I wanna be where ever you are
I wanna be futari kono mama
I wanna be so tomedonaku
Don't let go, Let me into your world

If you want my love
ima kara demo there's never too much
Satisfy my heart
yorisou toki ni, you know we're meant to be

If you want my love...
Satisfy my heart...

Days of fun and games might be over but (oh) sometimes I cry
It's not what you've said or done, baby
rikutsu ja nai

Don't deny your love
ima dakara I can tell you this much
Can you feel my heart?
tamerawazu ni, get yourself close to me

Analyze, Dissect, Detect, Process

If you want my love, love...
