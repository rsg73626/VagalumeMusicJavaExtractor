BEEN SO LONG

I've been waiting for so long
Nee HONTO ni sore de ii no?
Broken promises amai kotoba ni 
sasowarete yeah

You know it didn't have to be this way
Mou nani mo iwanaide iyasenai kono itami mo
Kikitakunai nagusame

With all my heart, with all my soul mou 
sugita koto wa wasureyou
With all my mind, with all my strength 
namida to nagarete yuku wa

** I've been waiting for so long
Toki to tomo ni kiete yuku no
Broken promises amai kotoba ni 
sasowarete yeah

Strobelite hijou jitai hassei
your nonsense wo kanzen ni moyasuze
it's tragic how nanzen mono rappers come 
& go
call this the banken flow
MC's best look out tsukau vocab's mental

Remember me, I'm the one you used to
doubt
Demo sokora no yatsu to wake ga chigau
Ima genzai kako no hanashi to wa en nai
Ya heard, it's UNI.KA

It's payday sakebe
my geimei it's Verbal I seikei
designing this while they play
Kodomo damashi moveover, 'cause
SUGEE unidentified
Toumei de nagareru hikari no you comin' 
your way

Sora kasuru kazukazu to narabu chokousou 
BIRU kakomu oto wo teikyou

Let me rock your cradle, you'll never figure 
out this
Meiro no you na rhyme scheme no iro wa 
keikou

Kokoro no KIZU naze itsumademo...sing it

Wasurerarenai no deshou...unlearn is the 
word shinjitsu manifest
why ask why...why? got no time for games
Iiwake kikanai...(that's right) kokoro no 
omoi kikasete kure yo
Kamisama souzou ijou kanaete kudasai
'Cause, you can light up my world
Doko kara tomo naku kikoete kuru oto 
coming
from the underground to a scene that is 
minus 10 degrees
