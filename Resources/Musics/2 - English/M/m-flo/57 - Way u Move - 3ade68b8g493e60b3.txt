WAY U MOVE

It's been a couple hours since you left me behind
I'm all alone... the keys you took was probably mine
so I just sit and watch tv. keep myself busy
trying to get you out of my mind

who was it that sang the old song love bites
remember that line? remembered it last night
see I've been kind of blue lately
thinkin' just maybe
I should ask one more time

so come home... come home... come home, today
come home... come home... come home..., today
come home... come home... come home
today... today... today... today, today

asteroid lover you're on my mind
a million years and still hard to find
intergalactically sexy
way you move gets me
now's the time let's be one!

are you ready?
I'm ready... (repeat)
