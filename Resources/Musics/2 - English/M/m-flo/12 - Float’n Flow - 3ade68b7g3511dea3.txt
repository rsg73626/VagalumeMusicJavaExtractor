FLOATâ€™N FLOW

A simple breeze of calming
The heat of oh romancing
Don't wanna end this feeling
This wave of my love

*1  I've been feeling lonely
I've been feeling low
But the minute that you give it, you just take me away
And that's what I'm asking for
Drifting like the waters
Coming all night long
And the minute that you give it, you just take me away
And that's what I'm looking for

*2  Your hands on me so suddenly
We're gonna flee together
(all the people get up and come on)

Memories are turning
But you are still here even though it's a one time summer crusin'
We're flying above the clouds

When I'm feelin lonely and I find myself alone
I just take myself to have a chicken curry with nan
At samrat shibuya store
Why'd I love your daughter? Ain't nobody know for sure
I would love to call and hang up when you pick up the phone
But your caller ID would show...

I go by V E the R B
A L and that's how people call me
But really really sometimes it's hard to be me
My real me... like I'm chillin with my families
People come... and, people go
But most just actin like friends than foes
Gotta be on the edge of my seat and my toes
Cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
What you expect man, it's show biz...
it's all for show... You're not supposed to
give your trust to most cuz most don't know... you
if you don't like it change your clothes and go... WHOOOH!
What's new? Under the sun
Ain't nothing changed, everything's been done...
But yo... what keeps me going is that "something"...
"Something" that moves me... and what moves me is my future with you

Your hands on me so suddenly
We're gonna flee together
(all the people get up and come on)

do you know how I feel? This is so real
So real, it's so real
No matter what they tell me I believe what I feel
You know it (You know it) You know it (You know it)
Don't speak

*1, *2 repetir
