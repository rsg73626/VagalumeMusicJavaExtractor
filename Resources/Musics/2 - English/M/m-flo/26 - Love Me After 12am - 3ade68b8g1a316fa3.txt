LOVE ME AFTER 12AM

Watch me when the sky is dark and sun asleep
Time is here for me to show you wait and see
Want to love you, give you just 'bout everything
Won't you come see me after 12AM
That's when I change...(×3)
I know you'll love me after 12AM

It's true eosaeg hajiman
Been screwed, nege dagaga

Watch me when the Tokyo lights glow in the street
Something turns me on and makes me want to scream
Wanna hug you, rub you up and down to your feet
I let myself looser after 12AM
That's when I change...(×3)
I know you'll love me after 12AM

Take me down to Akihabara City where the laptop's cheap and the lights are pretty
Let's get fitted, with the villainy outfits
Chillin' with velour suits make your boy jealous with the
Cinema tics, got killa tactics
So when clock hits 12 I be feelin' that kiss
Yeeeeaaaahhhh!! It's about that time
When I step out the phone booth watch me shine
In my linked up chains, vintage frames
Chanel's see right through your tinted brains
Let's switch lanes, out the mundane
So we can excange names and be Addicted to each other like Jane's...surely
Yes to the y'all and...we transforming
Get metabolic that's how we ballin'
From Cybertron to the stage of Apollo

Nobody ROBOTs, act like they so HOT
swarm like locusts, Please move over
Yall's getting' NO LOVE, hold up now
Let me go with my chauffer, slow down now
Room full of boom Clouds bigger than Louvre
Brown sugar on a soup Matsutake shrooms
From June to the mouth of the Moon I Lampoon
And lay on the sands of the Planet Dune

Huckleberry Finn in the skies
I'm lookin' at Smurfs play games
Well, there's fruits and we surf
Through the starry windows

Watch me when the sky is dark and sun asleep
Time is here for me to show you wait and see
Want to love you, give you just 'bout everything
Won't you come see me after 12AM
That's when I change...(×3)

Watch me when the Tokyo lights glow in the street
Something turns me on and makes me want to scream
Wanna hug you, rub you up and down to your feet
I let myself looser after 12AM
