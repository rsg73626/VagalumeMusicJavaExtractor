Uchuu ni ukabu wakusei "PLANET 01#" de
kyou wa FUNKTURNIZED DRYER LIGHTS no exhibition
isoide ikou! My time MASHIIN de...

Toki wo tobikoete, teiie de yorimichi shitetara
mado no soto ni woo... nijiiro no chikyuu!?

Why don't we go!, colorful world!, beautiful world!
nee, TORIPPU shiyou yo!
Pluto people mo C'mon let's go!
buttonderu kurai ga, choudo ii yo!
Why don't we go!, colorful world!, beautiful world!?

Yeah, peace na kokoro de...
gotta Live it like never before!

Global Astro vehicle on the way to Pluto
see me in the cockpit, my afro is rainbow
spandex swim cap for whiplash protection
when we swing past, billboards written in dingbat
meteorite bike fiends, on Harrys going at light speed
forget sight-seeing, interplanetary pirates get feisty
when I insert the disc, I mean serious business
elicit ecstatic responses from mister and misses
it's like I've been living for ages.
devastatin stages after stages
occupy floor spaces, with beings from all races
even nutcases, I'm old school...
blast the stereo with Stetsasonic
watching Jetsons with my Panasonic
prototype TV, monochrome, baby
manifesting the incandescent, into the triple darkness
boob tube filaments, shooting into the 7th galaxy

why don't we go!, colorful world!, beautiful world!
nee, souzou no basho e!
Pluto people mo C'mon let's go!
hajiketeru kurai ga choudo ii yo!
Why don't we go!, colorful world!, beautiful world!
Yeah, ai wo shinjite!
jinsei wo tanoshiku ikiyou! kono shunkan wo
gotta live it like never before!

Hit PURIZUMU (dot) Com, tobidasu NEO butterflies
you can synchronize and crystallize, retro vision
Scroll shitsutsu seek information

This dub is freaky freaky, making party people steamy
re-boot the system, start the extraspection
celestial retro-resurrection, infectious optical illusion
patterned and dated selection, it's classic
not suitable for the ignorant masses, I pass them
with this ride, it's fly octane, deranged from and figure
aeronautic features to beat ya,
rag-top with bleachers so everybody can hop in
planet to planet baby, poly-urethane burning asteroids
probing earth like Yuri Gagarin,
sonic shots bring mannequins
back to life like Lazarus
forget diamonds, I bring you a 100 karat meteorite
extraordinaire, got a asterisk next to my name
on your black list
I'm feelin right, sippin coffee through a nozzle,
custom-made by NASA
put mustard on my Kielbasa,
watching Farrah Fawcett on my electronic
three hundred sixty planetarium screen

Ikutsu mono tobira wo hiraite ikeba soko ni
itsuka wasureteita sekai ga aru

Why don't we go!, colorful world!, beautiful world!
nee, TORIPPU shiyou yo!
Pluto people mo C'mon let's go!
buttonderu kurai ga, choudo ii yo!
Why don't we go!, colorful world!, beautiful world!?

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
jinsei wo tanoshiku ikiyou! kono shunkan wo
gotta live it like never before!
