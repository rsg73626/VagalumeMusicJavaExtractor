I WANNA BE DOWN

You know the first time I saw you I was struck
like a comet inseki rakka what's love gotta do nante
thoughts boggling my mind
namae mo shirazu ni mainichi blind moumoku na guy
crazy about you honto wanna chikazuku look at you close
meoru na basho ni slide shite let's get to know
one another sono ba wo karite
subete keikaku doori ikeba be love love
ore no atama no naka dewa itatte kantan cause I'm the
I'm the smooth operator that gets the job done
sore wa aku made mo souzou
de jitsujou different kanari soutou
kimi no eyes be like diamonds in the sky
kurai toko ni mo light shine shite sparkle at night
kimi no koe in my ears constantly
tonari ni inai noni kikoete kuru, I'm hearing things
I wanna vibe-va-va-vibe-va-vibe futarikiri
tonight's the night!
soshite vibe-va-va-vibe-va-vibe tomaru koto naku
feelin' alright!

I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way
I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way

yo it's a strange twist of fate e ni egaita you na way that we met
deai wa itsumo accidental
fushigi na hajime no magical kotoba so sweet
koboreru from your lips like rain... ame no you ni fail
(down) mimi wo kasu beki dedicate these bars and hooks
listen tsuuyaku wa iranai shizumu
(down) dosei no rings rotate hoshii mono
way out! cape canaveral kara play... la dolce vita to
(I wanna be down) nounai souji
lobotomy, on my tokyo state of mind
flow wa posutomodan, demo naiyou wa divine
kaabon kopii dekinai, immortalize, kimi dake no style
verbal, no headspace ni youkoso
livin' life everyday like there ain't no tomorrow
kyouju, that's how they holla at me
cause I rock the microphone, most definitely... so let's
vibe-va-va-vibe-va-vibe futarikiri
tonight's the night!
vibe-va-va-vibe-va-vibe ima ga chance let's go!
(let's go!) let's go!

I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way
I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way

kore ijou plain
can it be more simple babe?
tsurete ikou ka
to never-never land

I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way
I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way

I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way
I wanna be down with you today
I wanna be down with you
no other way
