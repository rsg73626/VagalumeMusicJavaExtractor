PICTURE PERFECT LOVE

m-flo loves MONKEY MAJIK - Picture Perfect Love

* All that time that you were standing by my side
She's that picture-perfect kind
I can't believe I was so blind
Do you remember that time, you know I stepped across that line
I made you cry and that's my crime
I wish that I could just rewind

It's the evening and you've been complaining
About our situation and all my deceiving
I know…that everything's going SLOW
And if you wanna feel better I can tell ya that it's gonna be great
yeah it's gonna be good
OH-OH-OH but I would be lying to you

But these days I'm changing
Meeting new faces
How am I supposed to be
And my feelings for you seem to be changing
Looking back…don't look back on me

* repeat

When I RUN I gets NOWHERE
Because your love is on my mind and I can't let go BABE
When I HIDE she finds me still
I never should have let her into my LIFE…but she came saw and
Conquered it. EVERY part of me LEFT
When you settled out that's REALITY just settled IN
Of course I tried to BATTLE IT, TACKLE IT. when PROBLEMS got out of HAND
ESTABLISHING the BEST from the situation THAT I'M IN
…Couldn't BELIEVE that it could END
If LOVING YOU IS WRONG. I don't want to be RIGHT…is that a SIN?
Your name is tattooed on my heart IT'S PERMANENT
Your voice keep loopin my mind…I SAMPLED IT
The TRACK I'M IN/SHACKLES ME can't get out If I can PICK
All the TRICKS to make it RIGHT once AGAIN
You know that's like trying to make SODOM and GOMORRHA IMMACULATE
TO make us 2 come together's MIRACULOUS

* repeat

Yeah dawg you said it and I really think
You meant it I've been through it
All before and I'm about to get in it again,
Whats happenin' making new friends
Hoping it don't come to an end and in the meantime
I will show you what I mean
Let's think of it another way.
Everything we do and say.
Defines who we are as we live out each day
What we did was wrong at the time
But it helps us go back and rewind.
It's a mistake, but it ain't no crime
kasanari au no sa
tsumari sore ga ai

I said good bye
I didn't know
That it would all turn out this way
But now I know
I realize
And I can learn from my mistakes

But these days I'm changing
Meeting new faces
How am I supposed to be
And my feelings for you seem to be changing
Looking back…don't look back on me
