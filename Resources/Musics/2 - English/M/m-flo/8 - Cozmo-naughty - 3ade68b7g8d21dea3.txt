COZMO-NAUGHTY

Touch me, and you will see... Just see and believe
Electric, I'm a closet freak
BIBIBI! nanika you aru nara say please!

kokoro no DOA ni knock saretemo irusu wo tsukau no narereba
Easy to fake a smile or two
soshite go about today
Like I had nothing much to say
demo nazeka kienai this MOYAMOYA na haze

You say... you so "electric"
Can't touch it Like a yuushitessen  sawatte  OUCH!
nande sou edgy? kikasete me chikara
Strong and BOKE  tsukkomi  kamashitemo dame baby
Can't take  oseji  kokoro tozashite
jitsu wa you wanna be hajiketai kuse ni you don't show it
Nobody knows it
itsumo douse  tomodachi  phobic UH
whichever way the coin flip it's your choice
ki ga muitara Holla at yo boy

*1 Tell me why do we work over-time Looking for that "SOMEONE"?
Why you lookin around in and out of town being lost and found
And when we find that special "SOMEONE"
Then the love turns part-time
Then you lose yourself
...Love is cozmo-naughty

Last night I went to sleep
Crying cuz of heartbreak...
Good morning mada ita no?
Gotta go... dekakeru kara stay at home

hitomae de tsuyoku suru tame ni itsumo
I put some crazy make-up on
Ooh-la-la-ah-wee-wee
And so here goes another day
Like I had nothing much to say
demo naka wa utsuro na noni still playing games

Please... Please... Please take it slow
hachikiresou de think... can't even think
hajimatte mou not long ago na noni
naimononedari  tonari no shibafu wa green
Whooo... shock therapy  hitsuyou kamo
ya, yappasou  kako no TORAUMA  hikizutta mama
kono SHIATA- e to ENTER shita mean yonaka no fiend
koi ni ueteru phantom, not Rolls Royce
demo medachi makutteru no kamawazu, makin' noise
sonna ni ai saretai no nara  mazu learn to love
And be yourself
