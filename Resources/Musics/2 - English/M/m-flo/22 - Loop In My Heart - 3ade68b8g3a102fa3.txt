LOOP IN MY HEART

You called/I called/we talked/we laughed/we did...
karui kimochi na SUMMER
itsunomanika/Caught up/and uh...
One thing led to another...
In love/In what?/in love/say what?/say what?...
Girl I can't be your lover
He said/she said/uwasa?/uwasa?...

Baby... you know jitsu wa you're in my mind
ichinichijuu maji, oogesa ja nai
It's like...mitaiken na noni kangae
mahiru miru yume to tomo ni I drift yura~ri
yurayura, futari, wanna touch ya
Body de mawari, ki ni sezu FINA-RE made
mottecchau my imagination
souzou shite, mousou shite, ageru TENSHON
demo sagaru ze, honto no toko wa
no communication, ZATTSU chimeishou
That's why, setsunai I'm alone
ippo fumidashitai, so we could go home

toorisugiru kaze no you ni
suzushisou ni waraikakeru no
motto chikaku Just right next to me
sono saki no love story misete hoshii

*1 You called/I called/we talked/we laughed/we did...
karui kimochi de started
itsu no ma ni ka/Caught up/whassup?...
fukaku I thought we fell
In love/In what?/in love/ima?/say what?...
Girl I can't be your lover
He said/she said/uwasa?/uwasa?... demo hontou wa...

*2 Bet you wanna play with my heart
takamaru feelings ga high
And it feels so right (so right) so right (so right)
itsunomanika fell
For you~ (you tellin' me... you no sei de)
Ah~ (but I'm with you baby)
So bad (so bad) so bad (so bad)
You LOOP in my heart

kakatte konai phone machitsudzuke
futari no shashin mitsumete
kare ni wa so unfair dakedo baby
I can't get you outta my head

My name's V-E-R-B the A
soshite saigo ni tsuku no "L"
And I'm a part of a group wasurerarenai
namae with the kashiramoji "m"
tsudzuku "F-L-O" utau
With YOSHIKA hajimareba don't stop
TAKATAKA to the HASHI on the beats that rock
EMIRI ugokeba she don't stop

*1 repeat

*3 Why you wanna play with my heart
takamaru emotions so high
And it feels so right (so right) so right (so right)

On you~ (you tellin' me... you no sei de)
Ah~ (but I'm with you baby)
So bad (so bad) so bad (so bad)
You LOOP in my heart

Seen it, done it, been there done that
But kimi, maji, lookin so tsumannee
akubi kaki, jitsu wa got something to
Tell me, na noni why you keep frontin?
hanashi an nara chokusetsu say it
hanashi nai nara why you wanna stay here?
Feel fukanzen, kojireteku kankei

No matter how many times I try
ikura ittemo itsumo tsutawaranai...
baby you don't know (baby you don't know)
