SPANDEX ENORMITY

Waiting here on line
Suddenly from behind
She's still a block away
Why'd it have to be today
Now what do I see
She recognizes me
She hugs and squeezes me
She's the Spandex Enormity

She's so sweet when she's yanking on my meat
Then she yells is this trick or treat
It's too late she asks me for a date
Before I'd fuck I'd rather masturbate
Spandex, Spandex Enormity
A beast sent from Hell to plague me with misery

What a fucking beast
Her ass alone would be a feast
And her love drippings
Contained a stench of rotted yeast
The show must go on
It's the end of me
Taking up the whole front row
It's the Spandex Enormity

She's so sweet when she's yanking on my meat
Then she yells is this trick or treat
It's too late she asks me for a date
Before I'd fuck I'd rather masturbate
Spandex, Spandex Enormity
A beast sent from hell to plague me with misery

As we were walking off stage
You're waiting to come back
She's got a back stage pass
Oh no
I hide my head
The sight of you I dread
Her chubby little fingers grab my ass
Don't talk to me, talk to Nick, talk to Nick
Why does it always have to be me
You fucking fat bitch
I've had enough of you
Take your blubber buns and leave
She left here in tears
Followed by her rear
I could not help she's fat

She's so sweet when she's yanking on my meat
Then she yells is this trick or treat
It's too late she asks me for a date
Before I'd fuck I'd rather masturbate
Spandex, Spandex Enormity
A beast sent from Hell to plague me with misery
