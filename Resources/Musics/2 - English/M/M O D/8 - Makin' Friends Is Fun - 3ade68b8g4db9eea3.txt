MAKIN' FRIENDS IS FUN

Makin' Friends Is Fun

criticize our country - kick us when we're down
criticize our military movements on the ground
you think that we're a joke - here's something to quote:
shove your turban in your trap or I'm gonna kill your goat!!!

you wanna be a martyr - we're happy to oblige
you wanna be a victim of a system that divides
you wanna be a hero - then we gonna collide
you wanna go to paradise - we'll pay for the ride

scream about atrocities - our country has perpetraded
scream about the policies - about to be implimated
scream about alliances - our country has affiliated
scream about poor villages - about to be incinerated

say we are the terrorists - that we are to blame
that it might as well have been us piloting those planes
we brought it to ourselves - so you fuckin say
here's a couple daisy cutters - have a nice fuckin day!

scream about atrocities............

why don't you pack your bags and leave the States?!
since it pains you so much to watch their fate
here's your 10 million back - shove it up your fuckin Saudi ass!
getting rich on our democracy, riding on our freedom's back
...makin' friends is fun!

criticize our country...............

complain about our country - as coalitions build
with the UN as your soap box - and your pockets filled with bills
I got some news for new as you're drilling in the sand
the guilt is on your face, the blood is on your fuckin hands

scream about atrocities............

scream about humanity - America's insanity
you're always there kissing our ass when we're handing out our cash

why don't you pack your tent and leave the States?!
since it pains you so much to watch their fate
here's your 10 million back - shove it up your fucking Saudi ass!
getting rich on our democracy, riding on our freedom's back

why don't you pack your bags and leave?!
...making friends is FUN !
