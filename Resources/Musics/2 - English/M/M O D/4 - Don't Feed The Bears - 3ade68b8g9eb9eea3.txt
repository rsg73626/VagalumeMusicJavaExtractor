DON'T FEED THE BEARS

You have to prove
That you're not scared
Enter the cage
Take the dare
Screaming death
In the beast's lair
You couldn't read the signs
DON'T FEED THE BEARS

Don't go in there
You best beware

Don't feed the bears

Stupid fool
You should have known
That's some place you shouldn't go
Polar giant on you
Blood starts to flow
They belong not in a cage
But in the fucking snow

Don't go in there
You best beware

And please don't feed the fucking bears!
