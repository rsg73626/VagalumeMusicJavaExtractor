THRASH OR BE THRASHED

I've seen enough
I just can't take it
Why don't you mosh
Or have an epileptic fit
You stand there like you're at a parade
Call this your scene
But you're the one who betrayed
Got your feet glued to the floor
Just there and thrashed some more

You're the fuckup, a dick to the extreme
It's people like you
Who make me want to scream

Thrash or be thrashed
