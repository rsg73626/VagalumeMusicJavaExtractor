JIM GORDEN

Jim Gorden, the man who was insane
Jim Gorden, had Glaxo in his brain

Jim Gordon was insane
He took his mother's life
He used the hammer first
So she wouldn't feel the knife
He's gone insane
He's lost his mind

The voices in his head
Prove the bastard nuts
He bashed his mother's head in
Because she killed Paul Lynd

He couldn't play the drums
Cause people moved his hand
Was he just a mad man
We may never understand
He's gone insane
He's lost his mind

The voices in his head
Prove the bastard nuts
He bashed his mother's head in
Because she killed Paul Lynd

MOSH

Jim Gorden was insane
He took his mother's life
He used the hammer first
So she wouldn't feel the knife

He's gone insane, he's lost his mind
He couldn't play his drums
Cause people moved his hands
Was he just a mad man
We may never understand
