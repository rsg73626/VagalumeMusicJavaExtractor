DE MEN OF STEIN

De Men Of Stein

neo-fascist fashion queens prepare for techno war
dance around in rubber pants, goose step on the dance floor
DJs spin a lethal mix, hypnotizing neon lights
wearing proud the Iron Cross

dance around like Devo [repeat]

when they come to shine
tighten your pants in fear
...Ramm - de men of Stein

you must know your enemy
destroy all the non-believers
drive them down onto their knees
ein - two - tres - GO!

dance around like devo......... 

techno rules the world - techno rules the new reich [3x]
techno rules the world tonight

dance around like devo.........
