SCREAMING YOUR NAME

Every time I felt your body
Everybody could see that I loved you
Could felt my body shaking
With all inside me burning
My legs stopping
Losing all my senses
Cuz' you baby
You made me crazy

Please look at me
I'm screaming your name
(Screaming your name)

Yes, I felt in love for you
But I didn't forget it
Inside me it just grew

Oh I tired to do it
Moving me with this feel
I wanna walk with my own feet

No, I didn't stopped
You keep in my heart
I couldn't deny
When we were eye to eye
Shining like fireworks
Holding our hands
You made me lose all
This love will make me fall

Please look at me
I'm screaming your name
(Screaming your name)

Yes, I felt in love for you
But I didn't forget it
Inside me it just grew

Oh I tired to do it

I wanna walk with my own feet

Please scream to me
That you love me too
Look at me
I just love you and everything that you do
Don't go away
Make me shake again

Baby, like you never again

Please look at me
I'm screaming your name
(Screaming your name)
