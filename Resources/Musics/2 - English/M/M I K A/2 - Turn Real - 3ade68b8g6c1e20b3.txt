TURN REAL

I threw the dice and it gave me three
I moved my dreams six forward
But the laws made me walk three backward
Now I'm just following a heart board

It's strange, I don't understand
Now what should let me up
Are letting me down

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

It's not real, that's not me
Now what should let me smile
Are letting me cry

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

I made a “full house” I chose the right card
I won but feeling like if I was in a cage bird
Yeah, I need money to survive
But I wanna win just living my life

It's strange, I don't understand
Now what should let me up
Are letting me down

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

It's not real, that's not me
Now what should let me up
Are letting me down

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

I moved my king out of the walls
Like reward I was put in “sheik”
Waiting the hour to live upon on the clock
Please I need breath out of the walls

It's strange, I don't understand
Now what should let me up
Are letting me down

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

Dice, Cards and Chess
Ohh I wanna sing Dice
Cards and Chess
Ohh turn real my dreams
Dice, Cards and Chess
Ohh I'm a dreamer
Dice, Cards and Chess
Ohh singing my dreams

It's not real, that's not me
Now what should let me smile
Are letting me cry

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

Dice, Cards and Chess
Ohh I wanna sing Dice
Cards and Chess
Ohh turn real my dreams
Dice, Cards and Chess
Ohh I'm a dreamer
Dice, Cards and Chess
Ohh singing my dreams

It's strange, I don't understand
Now what should let me up
Are letting me down

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

It's not real, that's not me
Now what should let me smile
Are letting me cry

Dice, cards and chess
Stop with that games
I just wanna turn real my dreams

Hey, turn real, turn real
Hey, turn real, turn real
