WHAT YOU DO ABOUT ME

I wish that I was her and I wish that she was me
You gotta let her go, and I know that you agree
'Cause how could this ever start?
If you're afraid to break her heart?
You say you love me so
You have to let her know

Chorus
All that she wants is you
All that she sees is you
All that you gotta do
Is to set her free
That's what
That's what
What you do about me

Love's not an easy thing
Always somebody gets hurt
I know you were meant for me, even though she saw you first
But deal with her honestly
I won't let you cheat with me
I bet you never knew
What you've got yourself into

Chorus

We could beautiful
We could be so special
We could be wonderful

All that I want is you
All that I see is you
All that you gotta do
Is to set her free
That's what
That's what
What you do about me
