HELLO (NORWEGIAN SINGLE)

Hello
 
I belong with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I kiss your lips a thousand times
I sometimes I see you pass outside my door
 
Hello is it me you're looking for
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I ever wanted and my arms are open wide
And you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
But let me start by saying I love you
 
I love to see the sunlight in your face
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I think my heart will overflow
Hello I've just got to let you know
Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you
Tell me how to win your heart fore I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you (I love you)
 
Hello is it me you're looking for
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I ever wanted and my arms are open wide
And you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
I want to tell you so much I love you, I love you
