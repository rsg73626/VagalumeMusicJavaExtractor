THE DAY YOU WENT AWAY

Well I wonder,
Could it be?
When I was dreaming 'bout you baby
You were dreaming of me
Call me crazy,
Call me blind,
To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time

Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do, I do
You know I really really do

Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away.
Go On, Yay... Oh...

I remember - date and time
September 22nd Sunday twenty-five after nine
In the doorway
With your case
No longer shouting at each other
There were tears on our faces

And we were letting go of something special
Something we'll never have again, I know
I guess I really really know

Well hey, so much  need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true, for me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The Day you went away
The Day you went away
Go on, Yay...

Oh oh oh
Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do, I do
You know i really really do

Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true, for me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

Why do we never know what we've got till it's gone
How could I carry on
The day you went away
Cause i've been missing you so much I have to say
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The Day you went away...
Go on, Yay... Oh...
