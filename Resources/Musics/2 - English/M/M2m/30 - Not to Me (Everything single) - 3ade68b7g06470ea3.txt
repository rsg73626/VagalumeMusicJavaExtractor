Not To Me (3:08)
Written by
Marion Ravn/ Marit Larsen
 
VERSE ONE 1
You sent me up to heaven
I was safe and loved there
Then you pushed me down the ladder
Now you just left left me here
PRE-CHORUS 1
But I'm strong, cant get hurt
This must be wrong, won't sink down in the dirt
CHORUS
What's with me
This is not happening
Not to me
Not reality
Not to me
VERSE 2
Maybe it was my own fault
Maybe i just tripped and fell
To blame an angel tempts me now
Baby please take me up again
PRE-CHORUS 2
Forgive me
I didnt mean to comprehend and consider, my friend
CHORUS
PRE-CHORUS
CHORUS
