MISS POPULAR

She is miserable
Why make everyone else miserable too?
Oh, can't she see?
What she's putting innocent people through
Miss popular
Everything she does is wrong

Everywhere she goes
They'll be looking
And everywhere she turns
They'll be whispering
Oh, Miss Popular
What is happening?

She could have used
Her title for a good case
But instead she spits in everybody's face
Miss Popular
Every time she does it wrong

Everywhere she goes
They'll be looking
And everywhere she turns
They'll be whispering
Poor Miss Popular
It is happening

Chorus:
Oh, so now you know how it feels to be insignificant
Oh, so now you know how it feels to be all alone
Oh ah, when the lights go off
You can still dream of yourself
How hot you were
Miss popular

Everybody hates you
Poor Miss popular
I don't feel a bit sorry for you

Chorus

And everywhere she goes, 
They are looking
And everywhere she turns
They are whispering
