LEAVE ME ALONE

(Marion Raven)

Leave me alone
Stop calling me at home
Where did you get my number anyway?

Don't write me e-mails
Don't knock on my door
Don't you remember you didn't love me no more?

Chorus
Now it's over
It's nothing called you and me
It's over
Oh why can't you see?
What I'm trying to say is
Get out of my way
Yeah, it's over
It's nothing called you and me
It's over
Oh why can't you see?
What I'm trying to say is
Get out of my way!

I'm not your girl
Not even your friend
What makes you think I wanna try again

Don't buy me roses
Don't even try
And remember, big boys they don't cry

Chorus

I'm tired of hearing my friends say
That you still care
That you wanna come back into my life
Well, I just want you out of there
