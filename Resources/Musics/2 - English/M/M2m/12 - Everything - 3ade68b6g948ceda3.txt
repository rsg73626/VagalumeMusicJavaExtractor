EVERYTHING

It's been 9 days, 8 hours, 40 minutes, 10 seconds
since you called
I've been so crazy 
I've just about taken our picture off the wall
It's been 3 months over a hundred days 
since you held my hand
And I miss you in a thousand ways
Will I ever see you again

How did it change so fast 
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my everything,
everything, everything

(Everything, everything, everything)

It seems like everywhere everyone's in love
So where are you
And I remember you couldn't get enough
You felt it too
Oh..didn't you

How did it change so fast 
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my everything,
everything, everything

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my everything,
everything, everything

Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Ohh...you ruined my everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

It's been 9 days, 8 hours, 40 minutes, 10 seconds
3 months and a hundred days
And I miss you in a thousand ways
Will I ever see you again

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my everything,
everything, everything

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my everything,
everything, everything

Everything, everything, everything
