OUR SONG

Oh nobody ooohhh
I'm lying in my bed all alone
Called you once again
No one is home

It's raining outside
On Saturday night
Turning off the light
Again I try

My friends say I'm too good, too good for you
And maybe that is true
Well I don't care
What do they all know
They got it all wrong
This is so unfair they are playing our song

Chrous
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come back
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

It's done, you're on your own

Something is going on
What is wrong
I want you to be here
Why don't you come

And spend some time with me
Can't you see
How we come undone
Is this the end of our song

Chrous (2x)

How do I deal with how I feel
How to reveal what's real, love
As another day fades away
So I say

Chrous
