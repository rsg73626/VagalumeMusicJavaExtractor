GIRL IN YOUR DREAMS

"Girl In Your Dreams"

I was walking down the street one day
Then I saw you, I didn't know what to say
Your eyes were shining
Your smile was so kind
When I saw you I wanted you to be mine

Maybe I don't have the blonde hair you like
Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams
But I can show you what love means

One day you came and talked to me
And you said, "We are meant to be"
I was happy, everything was so nice
But then I found out that everything was a lie

Maybe I don't have the blonde hair you like
Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams
But I can show you what love means

[BRIDGE]
How could you do this to me
You said we are meant to be
You showed me how to cry
When you told me everything was a lie

Maybe I don't have the blonde hair you like
Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams
But I can show you what love means
