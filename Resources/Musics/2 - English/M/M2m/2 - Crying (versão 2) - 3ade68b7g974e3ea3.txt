CRYING (VERS√ÉO 2)

ohh ohh

well i wonder
could it be?
when i was dreamin bout you baby
you were dreaming of me
call me crazy
call me blind
to still be suffering is stupid
after all of this time

did i loose my love to someone better?
and does she love you like i do?
i do, i do, you know i really really do

(CHORUS)
well hey! 
so much i need to say
been lonly since the day
the day you went away
so sad but true
for me there's only you
been cryin since the day
the day you went away


i remember
date and time:
September 26, 
Sunday 25 after 9
in the doorway
with your case
no longer shouting at each other
there were tears on our faces

and we were letting go of something special
something we'll never have again
i know, i guess i really really know

(CHORUS)

the day you went away (2x)

did i loose my love to someone better?
and does she love you like i do?
i do, i do, i really really do

(CHORUS)
