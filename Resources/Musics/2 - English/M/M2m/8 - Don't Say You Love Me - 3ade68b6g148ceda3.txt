DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME

Got introduced to you by a friend
You were cute and all that, baby you set the trend
Yes you did oh
The next thing I know we're down at the cinema
We're sitting there, You said you love me
What's that about?

You're moving too fast, I don't understand you
I'm not ready yet, baby I can't pretend
You know  I can't
The best I can do is tell you to talk to me
It's possible, eventual
Love will find a way
Love will find a way...

CHORUS:
Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Here's how I play, here's where you stand
Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's back
I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice
Take it slow, you keep pushing me
You're pushing me away
Pushing me away...

CHORUS

oooo, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
na, na, na, na, na, na
oooo, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me baby...

Baby don't say love me, baby
(If you really want me, then give me some time)
Give me some time...

CHORUS (repeat until fade out)
