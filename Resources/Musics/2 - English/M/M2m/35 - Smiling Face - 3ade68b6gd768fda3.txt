SMILING FACE

VERSE 1
Sitting on the bus
Looking through the window
And I close my eyes
I see the shade of your smiling face
Your smiling face
When you walk in through the door
Smiling face
Like I've never seen before

VERSE 2
Standing in the rain
Nearly washed the day away
Then I think of you
I know the sight of your smiling face
Your smiling face
And it's always here with me
Smiling face
Well I wonder could it be

CHORUS
I still know
That I'm never gonna find you
But I do believe
That you're standing right behind
Will I ever get
The answer to my question
Life will go on, on

VERSE 3
Lying on my bed
Staring at the ceiling
Then I close my eyes again
The only thing that's clear to me
Is your smiling face
Maybe I should wake again
Smiling face
Maybe I should let it end

CHORUS
