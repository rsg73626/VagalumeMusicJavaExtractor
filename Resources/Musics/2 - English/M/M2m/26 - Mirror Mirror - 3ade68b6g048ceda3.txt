MIRROR MIRROR

Mirror, Mirror lie to me.
Show me what I wanna see.
Mirror, Mirror lie to me.

Why don't I like the girl I see?
The one who's standing right in front of me.
Why don't I think before I speak? (I speak)
I should have listened to that voice inside me.
I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
To say the kind of things I said last night

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall,
You don't have to tell me,
Who's the biggest fool of all.
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me.
And bring my baby back,
Bring my baby back to me.

Mirror, Mirror lie to me
Show me what I wanna see (to me)
Show me what I wanna see (to me)

Why did I let you walk away?
When all I had to do was say 'I'm sorry'.
I let my pride get in the way (get in the way)
In the heat of the moment I was to blame.
I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
Now in the cold light of the day I realize

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall,
You don't have to tell me,
Who's the biggest fool of all.
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me.
And bring my baby back,
Bring my baby back to me.

If only wishes could be dreams,
And all my dreams could come true.
There would be two of us standing here in front of you.
If you could show me that someone that I used to be.
Bring back my baby, my baby to me (my baby to me)

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall, (Oh, oh)
You don't have to tell me,
Who's the biggest fool of all.
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me.
And bring my baby back,
Bring my baby back to me. (my baby back)

Mirror, Mirror hanging on the wall, (baby, baby)
You don't have to tell me,
Who's the biggest fool of all. (I'm the biggest fool of all)
Mirror, Mirror I wish you could lie to me. (lie to me)
And bring my baby back,(Bring my baby back)
Bring my baby back (Baby back) to me.

Mirror, Mirror lie to me
Show me what I wanna see
Mirror, Mirror lie to me 

Mirror, Mirror lie to me
