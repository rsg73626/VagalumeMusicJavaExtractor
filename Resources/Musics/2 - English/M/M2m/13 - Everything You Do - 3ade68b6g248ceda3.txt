EVERYTHING YOU DO

From the moment you looked at me
And ever since you called my name
You've been everything that I've seen
And now I'm caught up in this game
My mind is spinning 'round and 'round
There's something special I have found
Everytime I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby, can't you see

Chorus:
That everything you do
(Everything that you do)
Makes me wanna go ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Everything you say
(Everything that you say)
Makes me wanna go ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh

They were trying to build a fence
By saying that this won't last
They tell me I don't have a chance
That everything moves too fast
But everytime I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby, can't you see

Chorus x 2

My mind is spinning 'round and 'round
There's something special I have found
Everytime I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby, can't you see
That everything you do ...

Everything you do
(Everything that you do)
Everything you say
(Everything that you say)

Chorus until fade
