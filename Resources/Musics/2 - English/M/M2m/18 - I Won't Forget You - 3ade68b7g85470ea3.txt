I WON'T FORGET YOU

The fading light of day lingers on your sleeping face My lover's lullaby lately lost its tender grace Somewhere in your dreams tonight Let my lips come close to you and hold me tight After all I hardly bear To turn my back to loving arms and leave you there

Chorus:
Babe, I won't forget you And I won't regret you I won't forgive you Anymore, no more

We said our first hello beneath a blue umbrella sky A simple moment shared by strangers who were passing by
People say when you're in love It seems as if tomorrow almost never comes, no never comes After all your loving touch Through my eyes of love to me it means so much And that's why

Chorus:
I wont forget you And I won't regret you I won't forgive you Anymore, no more
I won't forget you And I never let you Anymore, no more
