DAG (LOVE YOU SO MUCH)

Fear to get in love
Fear to fall apart
Fear to love you above the sky

Fear to make an mistake
Fear to make you hate me
No much time is passed away

Whoa! I don't know what to feel about
Whoa-woh! I can't put it out
Whoa! I don't know how to tell you

That I love you so much
I Feel so Much

Fear to get in love
Fear to fall apart
Fear to love you above the sky

Fear to make an mistake
Fear to make you hate me
No much time is passed away

Whoa! I don't know what to feel about
Whoa-woh! I can't put it out
Whoa! I don't know how to tell you

That I love you so much
I Feel so Much
I Feel so Much
