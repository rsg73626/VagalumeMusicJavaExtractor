LAST CHANCE TO PRAY

Out, out, freakin' out
Out, out, coming down

I stay awake all night long
It cannot be too strong
I've tryied to do my way
The last chance for a pray.
LAST CHANCE TO PRAY

Out, out, freakin' out
Out, out, coming down

I stay awake all night long
It cannot be too strong
I've tryied to do my way
The last chance for a pray.
