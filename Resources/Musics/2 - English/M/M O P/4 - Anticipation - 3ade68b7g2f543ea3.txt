[Lil Fame]
I'm here to make moves, I never fake moves, I like to break crews
In half, put 'em on they ass if they never pay dues
[It's time] To get rid of you fly talk
Fuckin with Fame, you be the next stain on the sidewalk
I make 'em simmer down, whenever I roll into town
And speak for my, love thug niggas in the crowd
I'm dedicated, never been over challenged
My over violent, lyrics'll knock you over balance
I whet emcees like Vietnamese, but yet they freeze
Like coke when they provoke me to squeeze
Lil Fame represent the turf
Would suck so hard they put scars on the face of the earth
[Out to hit ya] split ya, [hell when I get ya]
Fuck the frame, I blow your ass out the picture
So keep your eyes focused on this overdosage, I'm just comin through
To a hip hop spot near you

Predict them niggas around to sink a fucking ship
WHAT I feel is WHAT I do
And G, I see I might hafta straighten your ass out to
I wish I would let a nigga take mine
Where my niggas is niggas that live on the front line
"Hardcore" raw, Brownsville B Boy quick on the draw
Like the late great Prince LeRoy
When my nigga was on the scene
More ammunition passed through his ass than the average marine
[From the ill parks] Fool, where the steel start to ruckus
Deal a whole steel for you motherfuckers...
