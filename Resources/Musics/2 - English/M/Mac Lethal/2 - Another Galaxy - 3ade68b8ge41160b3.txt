ANOTHER GALAXY

I just want to be able to fly!
Yo, why do I keep putting all this pressure on myself?
Looking in the mirror lecturing myself
As-if it's possible for me to ever be better than myself
It's like I'm measuring my health by fame and money
But even if I'm broke the day still looks the same and sunny

I'm shrouded by these black clouds
Screamin' as I'm jabbin' the wall
I got a crown of thorns up on my head
I'm grabbin' my balls
I tried to break the doors of heaven
But I fucked up and shot myself in the foot with an ak-47
Today I had to use my ak
I gotta say it was a bad day
I ain't fuckin' joking, shit is mad cray
The stupid radio has been playing stupider tunes
I wanna move to one of jupiter's moons
And live forever

I'm starin' at the ceiling once again (once again)
Wondering if I'm just wasting time (wasting time)
I'm starin' at the ceiling once again (once again)
I made a blanket from this cape of mine - I'm sayin'
If you're lookin' for a super-hero baby
Well, motherfucker, that ain't me
I hate a lot of situations, wanna live in isolation
Make this world something that I can't see

I remember turning 30
I realized I gotta be stern and sturdy
It's real life, I gotta try to and earn and hurry
Gotta get concerned, man, I gotta get up early every day
Gotta work 10: 30, just to hunt the worm and birdy

And get a permed and purty girly from kansas city, missouri
That grew up on cans of tuna, and cans of shittier curry
I'm an artist
I'm a poet
My stanza's pretty and blurry
I'm rich, that's just something these dancers titties
Assure me, but
How can I enjoy a dancer with rump?
My ex-girl just told me that she found a cancerous lump
And she cheated on me
How can I be there for her?
Even though I hate you chad
I'm begging you to please support her

Cause I'm starin' at the ceiling once again (once again)
Wondering if I'm just wasting time (wasting time)
I'm starin' at the ceiling once again (once again)
I made a blanket from this cape of mine - now I'm sayin'
If you're lookin' for a super-hero baby
Well, motherfucker, that ain't me
I hate a lot of situations, wanna live in isolation
Make this world something that I can't see

The problem ain't my heart, right?
It can't be my heart, right?
I've always trusted it to get me through this dark nights
Now I feel it quitting on me
I think it's breaking up and splitting on me
Apparently I got the word "pussy" written on me!
I don't even know what I've become
I'm just so fucking stoned that I'm numb
Man I know it isn't fun
But I don't care I owned it to my son
Even if I got to pick the planet earth up and throw it at the sun

I'm staring at the ceiling once again (once again!)
Wondering if I'm just wasting time
Wait!
I'm tired of my pride exhausting me
I'm feeling uninspired like I've died a lost in me
This world is not for me

If you're looking for a superhero baby
Well, motherfucker that ain't me
I hate a lot of situations
Want to live in isolation
Make this world something I can't see

Fly, fly to another galaxy
To another galaxy we're gonna gon'
Fly, fly to another galaxy
To another galaxy we're going to
Fly, fly to another galaxy
To another galaxy we're going to
Fly, fly to another galaxy
