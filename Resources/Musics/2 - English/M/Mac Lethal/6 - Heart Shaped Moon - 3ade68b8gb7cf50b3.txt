HEART SHAPED MOON

There's a heart shaped moon in the sky and the stars are amazin'
Oh, shit- something 'bout your scars got me gazin'
Let's hop up in the car like we're crazy
And drive to the ocean, ocean, oh shit

Baby dip your toes in- send me to heaven
We're going to fall in love like whinnie and kevin
We're going to head into the city at seven
Before it gets dark, sit, park
I'mma try to stitch parts
Of your split heart back together
Angel with white-back feathers
Spare boots made of tight black leather
Keep her nickel-plated pistol right behind that dresser
Yessir
You ain't gonna find that treasure
Never!

Uh-uh, and I ain't just another blood sucker
Uh-uh, for you I'd probably kill a motherfucker
Stick the needle in between your toes like you buzzin'
Give you black rose after black rose by the dozen

And I don't want a scarlet whore
What'chu think the stars are for?
I'd rather find a woman that could turn
Into an artist when she walks through a department store
It's my imperial life
I'd rather have wife material
Than a God damned material wife, but
Ain't nothin vain 'bout a big bodied benz
You can tell your little twig 'hottie' friends
That I said

Your eyes are a color that I've never seen
I'm gonna save my money up and buy you everything
I said your eyes are a color that I've never seen
I'm gonna save my money up and buy you wedding rings

And all I wanna do before the world will end
Is buy my girl a benz
I said and all I wanna do before the world will end
Is buy my girl a benz

C'mon
Life is amazing
Had a son, now I got a wife that'll raise him
I remember spending half my life in a days inn
Every single night I would eat muffin bites and some raisins
For dinner
As a kid, using mics that were hasbro brand
Till I slid cross-country in an astro van
Big work, little pay
Like I put the money right in fucking castro's hands
But I attract those fans

That will dance, that will twirl and spin
Found a girl that got an other-worldly grin
And I shower her with diamonds, pearls, and gems
But all I wanna do is buy my girl a benz
See I don't want a scarlet whore
What'chu think the stars are for?
I'd rather find a woman that could turn
Into an artist when she walks through a department store

It's my imperial life
I'd rather have wife material
Than a God damned material wife but
Ain't nothing vain 'bout a big bodied benz
Girl, it's something we can get naughty in
Once again
Your eyes are a color that I've never seen
I'm gonna save my money up and buy you everything
I said your eyes are a color that I've never seen
I'm gonna save my money up and buy you wedding rings

And all I wanna do before the world will end
Is buy my girl a benz, once again say
All I wanna do before the world will end
Is buy my girl a benz, once again say
All I wanna do before the world will end
Is buy my girl a benz, once again, listen
All I wanna do before the world will end
Is buy my girl a mother fucking
