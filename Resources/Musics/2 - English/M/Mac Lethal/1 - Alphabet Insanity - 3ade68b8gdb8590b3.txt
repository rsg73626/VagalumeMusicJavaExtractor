ALPHABET INSANITY

I adamantly attack the alphabet
With an anecdotal algorithm made of Adamantium
I'm like an Adderrall-addicted anaconda
or an alcoholic or an asshole like A-Rod, no anabolics
But I brutally and beautifully butcher the banging beat
Brushing bubbly all over your booby and booty beef
'Cause I'm a carpenter - I come carving your carcass
Leaving all these carp fish crushed on the carpet
Crumbling chron in Colorado with my Cal cronies
I'm cramming it full of condiments like it's a Calzone
Delicious! I didn't drive and drink
Whether diamonds or dimes, man
I'm diving deep like an electric eel
I'm elegantly eloquent, and every cent
I've ever earned just entered me in the election
I got eleven brains like an enormously educated
Einstein with Elephantitis of the erection
A freak! I'm fighting with a flatfooted felon
Five falcons just flew to a fountain and fell in
Googling googly-eyed girls to get inside
Golly gee from Glasgow to Guatemela's gentrified
A hippopotamus is high on heroin, he heckles me
And hires Haitian Hank to hand his ho a hysterectomy
In hateful hieroglyph I hurl out hyperbolic hubris
And hang with Hipster Helen
that's the hooker with the huge hips
I'm ill. I'm Icarus. I ignite idiots in idioms and issues
Jumpy jargon I joust like Jacare jiving
Japanese judo and jiu-jitsu
Killing them like a kid
got a kilogram of ketamine for Kwanzaa
Knit a kimono made out of komodo dragon skin
Rich like a Klingon that be kicking it at the Kremlin
But I'm kicking through your door
call me Kramer Kardashian
Lethal. Literally litter a little limerick
that be littler than a Leprechaun
A menace that'll manifest the melancholy mayhem
Making a metamorphosis
until I'm mechanized like Megatron
Nick Nolte, a nerdy native of Nebraska
needs a neon ninja and a nectarine from Nasa
Ominously, I mean it's obvious
you see a orthodontist oozing
out oodles of onomatopoeias
Oswalt Patton picking a pocket, plucking a patent
I pickle purple poop in Patron for pure passion
I got a question, got to quiz ya
Let's step on the gas and go quicker. Uh
Really getting ready for the revolution
Reeled a rotten rhythm ring
around the Russian Ronda Rousey resort
Serve a simple sentiment
a simile that's smoking like a sheet of Sudafed
I'm swiftly swimming like a seahorse
Titties on Atilla tell a teller that'll toe-tag
Terminator gun inside a turtle-tattered tote bag
Thugs are Un-American, unattractive
and unwanted as an ugly pair of Uggs
Vivid and vivaviously venomous
with the wicked wombats only walking where women is
Getting xenophobic at the Xanadu
Xoxo, yippee-ki-yay
Yours truly, Mac
Yes, yo!
Oh, shit, I forgot Z... Zebra
