NIGHT SLAVE

when an agonizing night falls
i find my self involved in a wide forest
my soul is absorbed by light flames
and some strong agony absorbs my mind
in a eternal blood torment

supreme death is you vast black mantle
which comtemplates me with its sweet presence
and around me the majestic forest
is involved by coldand gloomy air

i contemplate the moon in the celestial black sky
which becomes present in an obscure emptness
reigning solemnly in the darkness
which has been offered to me as purification
turning into my vast empire
