HEALING

Now that we have got it through
One more fall
I can just admit I've got it all
Cause I do
Cause I've got you
We've crossed these bottom lines too many times
It passes through the heart
But it never leaves a mark

Chorus:
Cause Your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just lust to your love
Just keeps on healing me
One more cure, one more chance
That wasnt there before
In your arms
No pain can harm the way im feeling
Lord I know that your love is healing

I've picked around these lines in my head
But I've never listened to the words that you said
See where it's lead
Well I know I have it now
Cause You showed me how
And all I had to do
Was just to keep my eyes on you

Cause your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just lust to your love
Just keeps on healing me
One more cure, one more chance
That wasn't there before
In your arms
No pain can harm the way im feeling
Lord I know that Your love is healing

(Repeat)
