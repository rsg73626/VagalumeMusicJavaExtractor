FANTASY

I’ve never told you
The truth about myself
But these lies have changed me
I’m ready now for love

Caught in the mire
Of my false reality
I wished for an escape
From this long dark labyrinth

I lead you in the dark so trust me
The light that you see is close to you

‘cause i want again that smile on your face
Show me your halo of kindness and grace
Diving in your ocean
Sailing your soul
I’ll wake up again and
Truly live my fantasy?
