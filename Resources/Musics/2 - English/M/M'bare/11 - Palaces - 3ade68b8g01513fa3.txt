PALACES

I answer to fists of armed fingers
Waiting for command
Sons of sons who answer one
Afaraid to lead an upper hand
They've found a flaw
They'll find a hundred more
You see you're all a mistake
But all in all you'll save face
So please don't point your finger
When this is what you're meant to be
'Cause this is where you are
Get out of bed
We need you
Now

So aren't you glad you know now?
No not since we found out
Do you know what this means now?

We are swimming on our backs
Too tired to explain ourselves
Crying arched spines
And reaching for home
She won't drop us
