This is a message to, uh, all of you, who uh...
Don't believe, alright?

Aha
They gunna try to bring you down
Hatin's what they do
But you gotta keep a smile
Stay up on your move
Live free, live free
Homie live free, live free
Aha
They gunna try to tell you no
Shatter all your dreams
But you gotta get up, go
The bigger, better things
Live free, live free
Homie live free, live free

Hey yo, microphone check, one, two, one, two
We Good? Just had to make sure I'm coming through
With the driver Ricky Bobby
More class than the college
And the shine of Liberachi
About time that you acknowledge
That the boy here to stay
Fired that begin to blaze
Buzzin' out my name, gettin' out like a triple play
Hate to tell you what you can't do, fuck that, nah
Say there's everything you can do but rap, shit
I paint pictures with a hot flow, young Picasso
Feel me? I thought so
There's people in the world that are jealous of success
Don't even second guess yourself, step or get left, get left
We on the march we ain't waitin' for no man
You can't get distracted by haters and romance
So if you sittin' trapped in defeat
Get that monkey off your back, live free

They gunna try to bring you down
Hatin's what they do
But you gotta keep a smile
Stay up on your move
Live free, live free
Homie live free, live free
They gunna try to tell you no
Shatter all your dreams
But you gotta get up, go
The bigger, better things
Live free, live free
Homie live free, live free

Now everybody know I got haters like Maino
Actors all phony, give 'em Tonys like Yayo
Flush the bullshit out of music, Drano
This a true story type of movie, Fandango
Flamethrower, strange flow
They got me on the top like a Halo, a christmas tree angel, yeah
My team attack the game from all angles
Passin' all these rappers, just pussycats
Bengals
Hip Hop's Lebron, nothing better
Here to kick you out the game, Braylon Edwards
Fast Devin Hester, running like six speed
You gotta sign on ya back like kick me
I'm a race bike six speed, nah
You can't get me, move to swiftly
Don't deal with other rappers tryin to jip me
'Cause I'm way down the road where I live free

They gunna try to bring you down
Hatin's what they do
But you gotta keep a smile
Stay up on your move
Live free, live free
Homie live free, live free
They gunna try to tell you no
Shatter all your dreams
But you gotta get up, go
The bigger, better things
Live free, live free
Homie live free, live free
