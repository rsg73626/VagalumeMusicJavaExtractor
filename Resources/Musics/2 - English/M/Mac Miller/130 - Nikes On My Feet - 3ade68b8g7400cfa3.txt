NIKES ON MY FEET

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nikes, Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes

Aye lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete
Uh, I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store go and cop a few more
You in the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm at LA eatin' twenty two course
Young boss bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes
Mom says my spending habit a little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes wear-em-out
Hit the club bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin' they should give me a degree
Good liquor what I'm sippin' isn't cheap
Uh, finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nikes, Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nikes, Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes

I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippens on my feet they the throw backs
Look, my money good but these hoes bad
So they, stay attached to my gonads
Uh, wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm doin' well
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell
But, once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now we sellin' tapes out my shoe box
Any spot just set up my shop
Ya mad that ya girl always says that I'm hot
Shes buyin' my t-shirt but shes spendin' your guap
Uh, say what up if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground, just

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nikes, Nike Nike Nikes
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
