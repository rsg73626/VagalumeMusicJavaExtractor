SENIOR SKIP DAY

Kiiiiiiiiids, kids, ch-ya
Aha

I'm just high why they hating on me?
People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy patron for you and all your friends
Baby I be on my grind
Rain sleet snow
Rollin up good every place we go
Cause we trying get high (get high), get high (get high), get hiiiiiigh
Know the bullshit and all the problems
But we, too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give them what they need
Just waking up and gettin stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle
Damn, well it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs
Aye, gotta work with watcha got
Aye, gotta work with watcha got

Supposed to be in class but I ain't going
Let's, chill on the couch
See, what's on the telly
Girl we, won't leave house
Can ya, stay a while?
Can ya, stay a while?
Cause girl I'm feelin lazy and I'm tryna hang around

Ain't tryna get out of my bed till noon
Neighbors smell the perfume smoke in my room
And I got the door closed can't be sure though
Amsterdam weed, spending euros
Get the herb rolled
Let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escaped the world
Escaped the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
Cause we, gonna handle that later
We, gonna handle that later
Right now let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Aye, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a, glass of milk and an eggo
I'm rockin, PJ'S and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Haha
Enjoy the best things in your life
Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice
They say you waste time asleep
But I'm just tryna dream

Supposed to be in class but I ain't going
And let's, chill on the couch
See, what's on the telly
Girl we, won't leave house
Can ya, stay a while?
Can ya, stay a while?
Cause girl I'm feelin lazy and I'm tryna hang around
