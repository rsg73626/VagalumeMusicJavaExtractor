DIAMONDS & GOLD

She keep on gettin' played like it's recess 
Break her heart's a reflex 
She want to hit the beach, and show her titties down in Key West 
Someone leave her cryin' all the time and now she finally out of Kleenex 
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect, cause really she a genius 
A CEO, tryin' to be on top of loans, she don't keep them close 

She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss 
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse 
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time 
Want some money, tired of fuckin' dudes 
And falling all in love with who, was nothin' new 
Only coming through to bust a nut or two 

She just need her family like the Huxtables 
And now she on the road, left them home to take over 
Get rich and have her crib made over 
But she gonna do it partyin', with her cup full 
Ain't gonna trust you, but she gonna fuck you 

She wants diamonds, she wants gold 
But she's scared to let them get too close 
And she's been high and she's been low 
But now she finally on her own, own, own
And they've been looking 
So they been finding 
Cause she ain't running 
And she ain't hiding 
Until finds her way back home 
Until she's finally all alone 

She gonna be rich, as fuck 
In high school they were callin' her a slut 
But now she coming up, Louis Vuiton and Juicy on her butt 
She the bitches that be hatin' like "what's up?" 
Cause they ain't doing nothing and she out here stuntin' 

Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin' 
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down 
Invite you to the crib, let you look around 
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna to get your cheese 
Invite you out to dinner, cause she want to eat for free 
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though 
Go home, she got more dough 

She wants diamonds, she wants gold 
But she's scared to let them get too close 
And she's been high and she's been low 
But now she finally on her own, own, own
And they've been looking 
So they been finding 
Cause she ain't running 
And she ain't hiding 
Until finds her way back home 
Until she's finally all alone

She wants diamonds, she wants gold 
But she's scared to let them get too close 
And she's been high and she's been low 
But now she finally on her own, own, own
And they've been looking 
So they been finding 
Cause she ain't running 
And she ain't hiding 
Until finds her way back home 
Until she's finally all alone
