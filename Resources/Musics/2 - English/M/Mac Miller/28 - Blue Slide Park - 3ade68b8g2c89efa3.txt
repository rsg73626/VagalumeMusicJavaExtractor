BLUE SLIDE PARK

Blue Slide Park, its Blue Slide Park man, uhhhh, just fuckin' 
Blue Slide Park

Hey, I got these Ray Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my pants, screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash, now
Bank account lookin' like a George Young stash house
Youngin' actin' out and topics that
I rap about be very big if to politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper, 
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after

Daughters, moms kinda want me, neuter
But they also want the kid to come right on they cooter
Have the music sounding better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me John Stewart
So, who you know is iller than Mac Miller and Company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's so none of ya'll can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

Hold up Jerm, let me spit a second

Aye, yo I breeze past haters in the E Class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs, and that's this week
Shit keeps going on and on
We just tryna go bananas like its Donkey Kong, Yeah
On my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws prolly loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her to bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy within a regular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racing a bike
Who knew, that I could turn, turn sound into something so cool
Fresh kids see me I am bustin' dope moves
Comin', and soon, do a D-turn and view
Creep in your kitchen, start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when my knee in the room
Ooh, I switch flows switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition

Hey, Blue Slide Park

Digo Yukio
