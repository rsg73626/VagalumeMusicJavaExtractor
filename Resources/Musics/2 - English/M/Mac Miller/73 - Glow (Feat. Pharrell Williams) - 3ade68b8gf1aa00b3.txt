GLOW (FEAT. PHARRELL WILLIAMS)

You see that glow, that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
You see that glow, that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
Here we go

[Mac Miller - Verso 1]
I fuck around with them playmates, 
twenty thousand my day rate
Eatin' seven course meals now, people say that 
I gained weight
All you rappers you ain't safe, more money, same face
Been the shit, still the shit, just double up, exchange rate
Guess who just grown up now, y'all know sit the fuck down
Had to speak to P, said I need the beat
To show these clowns I don't fuck around
Asking me about money, wonder what's my network
People try to consume me, but I call up J.G. Wentworth
I glow, they don't, I suppose, let ?em go
Spend ten racks on my coat, 
fuck a whip just bought me a boat
My flow, is gross, be bread, get it I was toast
Without one, you reaching, you aint' close, no

[Pharrell - Refr達o]
Oh you ain't know (oh you ain't know)
Since I was born (since I was born)
My mind was gone (my mind was gone)
Know I was poor
Girl my mind any bitch I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (wrist was cold)
My world was snow (my world was snow)
What I need light fog
Girl I'm white as a bitch, I just glow
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
Girl I'm white as a bitch, I just glow
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
Girl I'm white as a bitch, I just glow

[Mac Miller - Verso 2]
I rap a lot, rap a lot, don't be afraid it's just after shock
Yeah jam like when Shaq grab the rock
I'm going in like a Magic shot, don't rap sweet like apricots
Shut the fuck up you don't have to talk
I'ma lay back with my ass on top
Got the game on match a lot motherfucker
You don't see cash a lot, 
bitch stop acting like you bad you not
I put my dick in her ass and twat 
and she look back like that's the spot
Call me, I'm counting money, play around with money
Charlie ain't shit without ya money
Life ain't all about the money
Well it kinda is if you out of money
Mac Millions, that's the name
Most Dope, that's the game
Drunk bitch so glad you came
Saw her taking off her clothes tryin have the train
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us with no rubbers
Fuck that, we to fuck each other, on tour we to fuck the runner
Motherfucker, just shit you need
You ain't fuck around my team
Cause you living all of your dreams
Here to kill your self esteem
And my flow is pyro
Smoke a blunt til my eyes close
Middle finger up high though
End this song on a high note

[Pharrell - Refr達o]
Oh you ain't know (oh you ain't know)
Since I was born (since I was born)
My mind was gone (my mind was gone)
Know I was poor
Girl my mind any bitch I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (wrist was cold)
My world was snow (my world was snow)
What I need light fog
Girl I'm white as a bitch, I just glow
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
Girl I'm white as a bitch, I just glow
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
I'm so special (I'm so special)
Girl I'm white as a bitch, I just glow

Yeah, yup
I be eating that Pink Slime
Bitch, that Pink Slime
Motherfuckerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
