A MILLION DOLLARS

I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'm a make a million
Bitch please, I'm a make a million cause
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'm a make a million
With ease, I'm a make a million

A lotta times I don't get the credit
Forgettin about my ethical work
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread
I been dedicatin' ever since I turned head
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads
I been workin', part time hustla
Hit you with a dub feedin bubblas
Got this brah
On the road with a dollar and a dream
Cause anything is possible, believe bitch please
It ain't nothin to spit, sparkin up in the whip
Stayin stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever sees a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head can't contain these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna leave behind
For now, it's food for thought it'll feed your mind
But you can't get a piece of mind (naw homie)

I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'm a make a million
Bitch please, I'm a make a million cause
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'm a make a million
With ease, I'm a make a million

Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get (3J) a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta
Cop a phantom just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple four models that I fi
