HALO

Yo, once again
it's a riot, better close the street
pathological liar
went to my girlfriend's house and set her dog on fire
blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi
fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watching movies
reach inside my backpack for the fully loaded uzi
started shootin' up the room he was in
that chappelle's show episode, you know, paul mooney was in

my head is dirty, took a suicide dive into some cow manure
now I'm chillin' chop and screwin' al b. Sure!
I got the clap from a bitch in el salvador

so I grabbed her house phone and strangled her without the cord
sorry I was bored, guess I'm quite sadistic
misfit, dipshit, he's always pessimistic
stuck in prison currently, my family never visits
psychological problems is really none of your business
