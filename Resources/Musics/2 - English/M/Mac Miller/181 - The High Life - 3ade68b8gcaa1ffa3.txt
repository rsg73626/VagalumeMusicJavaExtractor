THE HIGH LIFE

(Intro do Ã¡lbum: The High Life)

I'm so high, so high
Find me somewhere in the sky, in the sky
And I know, I know, I know, these days just flow by, flow by
When you're so high, so high
Head is somewhere in the sky, in the sky
And you know, you know, 
You know, these days just flow by, flow by
When you're so high
Yeah, my name is Mac Miller
And you are now living
The high life
Most Dope!
Big Jerm I see ya!
Get into it
