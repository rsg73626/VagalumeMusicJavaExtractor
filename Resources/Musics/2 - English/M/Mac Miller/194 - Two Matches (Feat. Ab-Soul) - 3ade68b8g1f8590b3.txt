TWO MATCHES (FEAT. AB-SOUL)

[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause in my life time
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
In my life time, my whole M. O. was to get this M. O. N. E. Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things
through these gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say
and get along with our day
She say "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"
I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) Our Anarchy is our Nr key
Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia
Soul!

Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit
How'd I end up in a place like this?
Swear to god, seen some shit
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
In this life time, be the time of your life
It's been a while
but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind
will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs
the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important
but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin'
that's my departure
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky
with the eyes of an archer
What a fine act you got for
I don't know why what I get soo high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein'
what came across these eyes
There was a time

[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause In my life time
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

[Bridge: Mac Miler]
Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that

[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit
How'd I end up in a place like this?
Swear to god, seen some shit
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Outro: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
We all grow up to be gangstas, playas, snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians
Good and evil people
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Lately I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all!
Aye, let me just add one more thing, Josh
(Watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!)
