LOITERING

Cam Erlim, is that it? 
Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha 
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses 

Ay yo I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin' 
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin 
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell me come and bring a mill in 
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim 
Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down 
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign 
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap 
Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques 
Take it back, cook it on them hoes, you can make a casserole 
Mad that I can rap so well and everything on factual 
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall and racquetball 
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall 
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work 
Black shirt, Cam Rellim, that's my name said backwards 
Ask first, hell nah
Treat em' like a bellhop 
Let em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy 

I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground 
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground 
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground 
Shorty come and kick it at the swing (at the swings)

I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground 
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground 
Cops comin', motherfucker stay down 
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings (at the swings)

Ay yo I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin' 
Got this rap shit down to a science 
My Louie Belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment 
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance 
Is just a motherfuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big 
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a Ski Slope 
Rockin' in the fall like a Pea Coat, freaks with a deep throat 
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De Niro
I be low, key though, Young Nino with my jeans low
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go
You can hear the way she's moaning
Started back at midnight, had it 'til the morning
Wake up with some morning wood
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would
All my female fans like: "I'm sure it's good"

I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground 
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground 
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground 
Shorty come and kick it at the swing (at the swings)

I'm too old to be chilin' at the playground 
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground 
Cops comin', motherfucker stay down 
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings (at the swings)
