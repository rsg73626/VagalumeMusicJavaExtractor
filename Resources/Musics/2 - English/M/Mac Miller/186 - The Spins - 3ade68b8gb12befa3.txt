THE SPINS

Dope shit like that Jerm
Up high
Welcome back to K.I.D.S.

Ummmmm, follow your dreams
Yeah

Wanna get a mansion
A jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies
A couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the goonies
Ah, see the future the crystal ball
Mirror, mirror hangin on the wall
Who the flyest white boy a them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin all da calls

She bubblin'
We fuckin'
Then we cuddling
Like baby where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin nothing
You could probably tell she bluffin'
Cuz she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion

Yeah she blushin'
All red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you'd da feds
So she says
She in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed
So she asks me where the tops are, tops are

Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Only I need you
Fly
I'm low
I'm low

Just motherfuckin' kids

Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Only I need you
Fly
I'm low
I'm low

Hey Jerm, hey

These hoes is drunk
Wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home
And do anything I want
I say baby I can ride ya
Just let me get inside ya
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizor

I got dat dope dick
I'll be your supplier
You grabbin on my sheets
and hittin' notes like you Mariah

Obsessed with me
Wanna dress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin me
Like what you doin next week, next week

Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please baby
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up till the end
A million times of drillion hearts

Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Only I need you
Fly
I'm low
I'm low

Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Only I need you
Fly
I'm low
I'm low

Hey Homie
Dont be mad that your girl loves me
It's not my fault
I'm just doin me
The girl love me let her love me
Ya feel me?

So baby
Smile!
Baby dont cry!
I want you to fly!
You by my side!
