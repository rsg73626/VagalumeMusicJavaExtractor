ANOTHER NIGHT

As I spend another night with out a single thing to do
Cept' writin down this music i preceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up he got some weed he bringin through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of swishers too

That's what usually happens Deserve some cool relaxin
Smokin herb and laughin and curve your enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid at my crib doin regular shit burnin 5 spliffs
I'm so high another night alone so 
Imma poor another cup and roll another zone

I'm gone you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone couldnt tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me hit me on Twitter
Well that sound mad lame

People love me they don't even know my last name
Waitin at the station till its time that i can board the train
Headin to the fortune fame should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout, pour a little liquor then i drink it down

Refr達o
Cuz its just another night on my own layin back as i light up my dro
It's just another night alone..i spend another night alone
Said cuz its just another night on my own layin back as i light up my dro
It's just another night alone..i spend another night alone

I turn my phone on silent i need to get away
Turn on Jcool warm up and let it play
I thank god for blessing me with life every day
And to my peoples whove gone well meet at heavens gate

I've been sellin haze but I'm sure theres better ways
That i can get my pay i just need to get Straight
Nothin left to say now its time for action
No more bullshit no more relaxin

Rappins my passion so i stay writtin
Spend a couple nights in burn out all the lights in my room
Stuck in my crib like glue
That's what i do its nothin new
