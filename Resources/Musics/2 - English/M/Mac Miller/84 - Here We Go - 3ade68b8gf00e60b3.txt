HERE WE GO

Be without fear in the face of your enemies
be brave and upright that God may love thee
speak the truth even if it leads to your death
safeguard the helpless and do no wrong
this is your oath

polo pajamas, I think I made it
I show my mom my first millions, she damn near fainted
the rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance
the legends put out the latest, I feel that it sound outdated
I'm the hardest working person in the universe
temptation victim to the church of lucifer
internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work

you spent your whole advance on two chains and a gucci verse
I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest
and now I hold a grudge against anybody who hated
I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist
if I ain't in your top 10 then you're a racist
cocaine ether creates a strange creature
they wasn't hearing me 'till I fucked with a brainfeeder
I'm still playing it out the same speakers
I did it all without a drake feature!

so many things that I've created
but this right here might be my favorite
they ask me how I feel, I say "amazing"
I feel amazing
so many things that I've created
but this right here might be my favorite

brand new home, I think I made it
key to the city, I keep to open the gates with
a briefcase with a million under the pavement
that's just on some rainy day shit, yeah
the kids getting murdered that I grew up with
they shooting up doing drugs or they doing nothing
my girl's parents still living out in the hood

I come through in that new beamer like the shit all good
damn, I'm just a human let me make mistakes
shit has changed ain't little malcolm with a baby face
even my homies tell me take a break
they know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste
trying to be a legend by tomorrow
they say I can't, I'm determined to prove em' wrong though
I'm not perfect but they ain't either
I did it all without a jay feature!
