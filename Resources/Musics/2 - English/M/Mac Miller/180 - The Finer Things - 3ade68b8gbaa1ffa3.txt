THE FINER THINGS

Yeah, Mac Miller, ayy
Uh, you know the finer things in life, you know
Sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit
Look, relax

Ahaa, I like sittin' in shotgun, deuce on a L
Parents not carin' cause they used to the smell
Classy Ass Women, fresh Ass linen
Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in
A good spot to kick it, a case of fourties
Them homies always havin' good stories
The beer bottles with the twist off caps
When old people tell you that they listen to rap
I love days I can sleep in, full day weekends
Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin'
Blunt rise, with a mixtape bumpin'
I love makin' love in public
And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town
Findin' a crispy ass twenty on the ground
Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House
Or action movies when the villain pull the gun out

The best things in life is the free ones
The little things everybody need some
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember

The best things in life is the free ones
The little things everybody need some
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember

I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass
Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass
Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly
When your weed man hit you with some sticky
Street performers, warmin' up the corners
Sellin' by the ounce, then pinch it by the quarter
With some kicks on sell
Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shit load of mail
The wake up to bake up, chillin while you face blunts
Goin' in blowed for your shape up, like say what?
Blog put your tape up, get a good review
When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do
When she rub my head while I'm between her knees
Gettin love from the people overseas
Haters tryin' to hate, but they got nothin' to say
It's just the little things that get me through the day

The best things in life is the free ones
The lil things everybody need some
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember

The best things in life is the free ones
The lil things everybody need some
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember

Like I said before, it's your boy, Mac Miller
They tryin' to tell me I couldn't do this beat
Know what I said? I didn't say nothin'
I just went in the booth and did it
Somebody tell Will to get some malt liquor next time
Ahaa...
