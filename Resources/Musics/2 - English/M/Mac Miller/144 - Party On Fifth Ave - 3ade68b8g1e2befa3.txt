PARTY ON FIFTH AVE

I think, I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so where's my kids at?
And motherfuckin' hatin' sounded funnier than Sinbad
I'm I'll as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the kids that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild
Six third in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you mane
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

There's a party on fifth ave (a party on fifth ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty
I'mma hump it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road (cause we gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on fifth ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do

Hey, what's the difference between me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than beetle juice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep til noon, what every day people do
So haters see me improve just give me a week or two
See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude
My rhyme talent is why, my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gonna put it aside
This that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
So let's head out to the party, I'll drive

There's a party on fifth ave (a party on fifth ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty
I'mma hump it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road (cause we gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on fifth ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do

What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gonna do that now

My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
My light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
Cause, there's a party on fifth ave

There's a party on fifth ave (a party on fifth ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty
I'mma hump it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road (cause we gotta hit the road)

Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on fifth ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do
