PROGRAMS

Yep, yep, yep, yuh, yuh, yuh

I don't got a reason to lie
They gave me the key to the sky
But I'd rather open my eyes
'Cause that's what'll keep me alive
Somethin' that's easin' my mind
Please do not fuck up my day
Everybody want a headline
I don't got nothin' to say
'Cept I'm comin' back with the freshness
You know I love makin' an entrance
Now now, don't get defensive
Time is a matter of seconds (one, two, yeah)
Off to see the wizard, lead the picture, me and liquor
Evil mixture, demons clitter
Clean the whiskers, seeking Mr. Fisherman
Back on my shit again
Doin' my own dance
Feel the rhythm that's no hands
I tell ya vision like programs
Busy livin' on triple digits, young old man
Ya'll dead wrong, I'm upper with the echelon
So butter when the bread long
I'm going strong till my head gone ('til my head gone)
Yeah, floatin' back up on the scene, I'm sayin hello (hello)
Do my thing up on the strings like Tom Morello
I keep it movin', you'll be doin way to much
I ain't tellin' time just to tell you when it's up (yup)

Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (yeah)
Yeah, one for you and one for me (yeah, yeah)
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me

Yeah, I mean wow, do not touch that dial
I've waited a while, been around
Just like word of mouth, you gon' hear me out (and I)
And I, and I, and I put that on my house
I'm always goin' overboard, I better swim before I drown (drown)
I'm like rubber with the bounce, hundred be the count
Drummin' loud, that's Stunner with the sounds, yeah (bang, bang, bang, bang)
I was younger, fuck around, every summer wild
Always had it jumpin' at the house
Clappin' for ya'll, I'm into havin' it all
Feelin' like Shaq with the call, stature is tall
Rollin' around with the homies, a battery pack on my dawgs
Fuck with my dawgs, havin' enough ain't a lot
Puttin' a check in the box, straight to the top
It don't matter, never mind the pattern when you're takin' your shot
Yeah, enough with the bullshit
Enough with the bullshit
Enough with the extras, fuck all my money, I swear I been through it
Fuck all the losin', that's just an illusion
Gotta keep them comin' back for more to keep it movin'

Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (yeah)
One for you and one for me (yeah, yeah)
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (love for me)

Follow me another way
Yeah, you know you better stand god damn
Put your hands together, everybody got money, get the band together
Movin' like you can't stand the weather, but it ain't gon' rain always
