OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR

(Verso 1)
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking about her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free
Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When, your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You, never taught me how to heal the pain
I, wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

(Refr達o)
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Is leave it all in the rear-view
Is leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

(Verso 2)
And mend a broken heart girl if you can
Don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble can you give a hand
It seems perfection really is unattainable
Don't even say you about to end it all
Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself
I ain't so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top
And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop
And who do you call to give the coup a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

(Refr達o)
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sat in silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Is leave it all in the rear-view
Is leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
