ALL THIS

[Refrão]
We spending all this money
And all this shine
Piffing all this cudi
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for better or for
All this money
And all this shine
And it's all so funny
Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for better or for worse

[Verso 1]
I'm looking out the window
The kid stayin' lit like a zippo
You hatin I don't trip bro
It's gravy cause your bitch know
Cup of henni, I sip slow
The spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme call me flip mode
This, that the other rhymer make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back you reminisce all your favorite classics
My words play more than madlibs
I got plenty lyrics
They got plenty adlibs
Want a holy spirit
My fathers on some rap shit
Listen to trap, getting high puffin loud
See some people ridin' by
Come outside say what up
I ain't nothing like a star
I'm chillin', layin' back
Travel all around the whole world
Enjoying where I'm at
Meeting different people
Eating different food
No one like a gourmet meal
More than you

Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before

[Verso 2]
They actin like they jealous
Everybody be thinkin' they was cool
Getting money since my mommy was dropping me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the pirates so you losin'
I'm in the news, you let them bring your news in
I bowl strikes you always leavin' a few pins
I do me you keeping up with them new trends
I got fame you worried about makin new friends
I'm in my pj's you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin without doing, where, how, why me
Relax myself kick it like tai-chi
You could find me, only where I'm at
There ain't no other mes
They be checkin on my stats
How cat I find them up in a tree
Homie be spittin bars they ain't fuckin with me
I'm just turning up the heat to one hundred degrees
Spittin like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth

Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before
