PAPER ROUTE (FEAT. CHEVY WOODS)

[Mac Miller]
Chevy please let me roll this weed up
This the main event so watch people pull they seats up
Bottle of some gin let's just hit a couple freaks up
I'm a take one home and have her singing like the Glee club
Never on no cheap stuff
Here we got expensive taste
Green lights never press the breaks
You can look at us roll all the kush that we blow
So you know I'm at the show looking good for theses hoes
Got they man on patrol
Shawty wanna live it up
Playin hard to get but she wanna give it up
Yeah you smokin good but we probably smokin better
One hundred and fifty-one takin shots with no barretta
Know me homie I'm the king you could watch me do my thing
With a drink getting drunk havin one night flings
This is Pittsburgh home of the six rings
We getting money now all we here Cha Ching

[Chevy Woods]
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later, cause we down here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later, cause we down here on this road

Cool ass, fly around chillen young fool
Gin cups sippen that's me, that's what I do
I got the gang in my bloodstream, strong how I'm livin
And I'm G'd up so now they just throwin away the kitten, it's real
I swear you hella bad the younger Mac tell me bout you
But we cool if you stuck up we could go without you
We on the money we schooling you know we be the block
I swear the homie gotta gift so he don't need the block
Zig Zag papers, king size
Smoking chillin' in angery cars, mean rides
Pops was a hustler and moms ran track
So tell me what you get in me when you mix that
I just sit back light minds
And middle finger you suckers with my nice rhymes
So whether home or the road
We gettin dough it follow us everywhere that we go

And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later, cause we down here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later, cause we down here on this road
