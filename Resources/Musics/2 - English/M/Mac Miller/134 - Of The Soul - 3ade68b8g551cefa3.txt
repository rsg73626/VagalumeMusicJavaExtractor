OF THE SOUL

Uh, uh, looks like guy, produce song on paper
First time I did that in like two years
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fucking girls but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that entering my brain
All the sudden every legend keep on mentioning my name
All that doesn't show me that my life would never be the same
Police try and figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arriving to the party in the chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes very ill
Eternal sunshine, Jim Carrey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La Do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

I little soul like De La Do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes, been high, on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, six nine
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work for bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho
Dontist, manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way
Spread, like yolk from a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La Do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

I little soul like De La Do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

Hypothetically I'm dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, one hundred ten degrees
Visually stunnin', you gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent, all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect, me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof
It was nothing but some déjà vu
