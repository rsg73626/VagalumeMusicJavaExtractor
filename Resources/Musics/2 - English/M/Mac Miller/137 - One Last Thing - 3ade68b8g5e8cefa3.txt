ONE LAST THING

Everybody wanna ask, where I came from? 
Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'mma make some 
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one 
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come 
A million people in the world, I don't hate one 
Even them dummies Robbin people with some fake guns 
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard 

And you don't ever figure out what you don't want at first 
I got another verse, invincible and nothing hurts 
One hundred words coming up with what 'll have your bubble burst 
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first 
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first 
I used to try everything with her, and nothing worked 
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first 
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid 

Being free, tell me what kind of crime that is 
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences 
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this 
You just entered into Blue Slide Park 
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart 
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard 
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark 
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars 

Who knew this music would get me a couple cars 
That just sit in park cause I'm out somewhere travelin' 
Mac on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin' 
Mad cause been known to always spaz again 
Every single track with him 
Oh, he's just so talented 
Dream of countin' money till my fingers get some calluses 
King with many palaces, a fucking golden fork to eat my salad with 

I observe, asking what did he design 
I see an artificial future for a digital mind 
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime 
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind 
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes 
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside 
No 
Hell no, hahaha
I wanna go back home, back home, back home

Late night can't remember what the day's like 
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights 
Cause it seems that I'm always on the move, move, move
When they gonna let me back home, home, home
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
I wanna go back home, home, home
I wanna go back home, home, home
