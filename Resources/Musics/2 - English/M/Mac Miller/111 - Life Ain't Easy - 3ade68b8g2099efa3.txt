LIFE AIN'T EASY

When I get old imma be real cool
Sittin on the Porsche with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell em to believe that we makin it big

And I know
That life is nothing easy
One day, imma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

Hey, from the outside looking in it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money and money is time
They tell me get there at five but I'm running behind
I try and live a little go and have a little fun
You only young once so all the hatin that be dumb
If life a joke then I'm waiting for the punch
You all about the beef but me, I'm bout the bun
The bread cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together spittin what they fuckin with
If they ain't it's great no intention to the hate
Nothing changed still cutting up Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude now makin moves
It's like everything I do front page news
I ain't playin in this game to lose
I want it all no secret the change they can keep it

When I get old imma be real cool
Sittin on the Porsche with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell em to believe that we makin it big

And I know
That life is nothing easy
One day, imma change the world
And they'll finally believe me


Hey, my grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See it's a blessin that I'm gettin through the door
The money gonna fall, when it rain, it pours
Dear music, you're everything I have now
When there's an army commin for me I won't back down
Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown but who's laughing now
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feels great to see my family proud but
I make mistakes too
My people always tell me Mac
please don't ever let the fame change you
They say I'm so different but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doing what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin paid too

When I get old imma be real cool
Sittin on the Porsche with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell em to believe that we makin it big

And I know
That life is nothing easy
One day, imma change the world
And they'll finally believe me
