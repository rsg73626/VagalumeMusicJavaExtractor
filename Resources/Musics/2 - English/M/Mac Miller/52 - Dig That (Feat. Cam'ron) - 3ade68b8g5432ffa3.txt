DIG THAT (FEAT. CAM'RON)

[Cam'ron]
Another 7 AM session with Mac, high as a motherfucker man
Edward EG just walked in, waddup baller!
Mac Miller in the building! Lemme tell you this story
Though real quick, about this ho
Excuse me ma, about this "chick"
This how it went down tho:

[Cam'ron]
Baby says she sick of me, sick of me, you kidding me?
Fuck the fuckery, you comfort me, you diggin me?
Not Scooby Doo, boo-boo, no mystery
Not school, but I tell you the history
Wanted me to wife her, I just want to pipe her
Only gave her cab fare, I would've white Nike'd her
Baby won't quit tho, she a fighter
I'm like "God damn, it was just a one-nighter"
Don't know what I said to her
But now, the girl I'm deadin her
Caught the vapors, Schwarzenegger never seen this Predator
Venus a competitor, my cream and my cheddar, arr
See more tennis than Venus Serena and Federer
Sergio Tacchini, Lamborghini, man etc
If life feels like a movie, I'll truly be your editor
Cam did it, your man live it, I ran with it
2 thousand dollar sweater?

[Mac Miller]
I tell 'em oh yeah, motherfucker, oh yeah
I'm getting money with my homies, yeah you know I'm gonna share
Might get hard, I don't care, I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't scared
I got my peoples and they iller than yours is
So can you dig that? Dig that? Dig that? 
So can you dig that? Dig that? Dig that?
So can you dig that? Dig that? Dig that?
So can you dig that? Dig that? Dig that?

[Mac Miller]
I must admit it, I'm just iller than most
This business, I get up in it, like I'm pimpin
