COME BACK TO EARTH

My regrets looked just like text I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors that move like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

In my own way, just feel like living
Some ultimate reality
And I was just drowning, but now I'm swimming
Do stressful workouts to relief
Yeah, all the things I do
To spend a little time with her
What I won't tell you
I probably never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you're inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like a rain
Gray skies are drifting, now I'm leaving forever
They told me it only gets better

My regrets looked just like text I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors that move like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
