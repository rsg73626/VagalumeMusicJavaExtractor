3RD DIMENSION

They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin'
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li livin' it up (hey, hey)

They wonder where I'm gon be at, poster with my chiefsack
Seat back keep ya shit together like a kneecap
He's that, bad muthafucka with an attitude
Haters tryna play him I ain't even gettin' mad at you
Fruity Judy spittin' but he rapping like kiwi
I receive better than your satellite TV
Creepy, rhymes that'll give em' heebie jeebies
Hoes showin' titties tryna get a CD free
Please, grass stay together like a twelve tin
Turning down groupies now they think i'm gettin' selfish
I'm not cocky I'm just confident
Wave you off move along if your not convinced
Got way too much shit up on my shopping list
While you broke doing coke tryna copy this
Hop off the dick, let me be on my way
I don't pay attention stay having good days, so

They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin'
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li livin' it up (hey, hey)

As I'm ridin' next to TreeJ
Speedin' down the freeway
Headin' to the money no pause no delay
Racin' like a relay, hear me through the PA
Chief till I'm sleeping fuck the D to the EA
I'm in this game no playing for the pesos
Tryna dip into this cheese like queso
Classes never seem to be there when they take role
I was runnin' to my dream tryna make more
Music, make another song
They tell me they supported they was hatin' all along
Love greater than the hate that I was gettin'
Didn't phase me for a second
So lately I've been gettin' kinda crazy
And I mentioned to my lady
When she stressin' that I'm cakin' it's a blessing
I'm just trying to get her in the right direction
You wanted more and I'm coming prepared
Most Dope put your thumb in the air, motherfucker

They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin'
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li livin' it up (hey, hey)

I think I'm having an overdose of this call my wife
Overdose of what?
Marijuana! I don't know if it had something in it, 
can you please come rescue
Do you guys have kief or anything?
No I just... I think we're dying
Ok how much did you guys have?
I-I don't know we made brownies, and I think we're dead. 
Time is going by really, really, really, really slow.
