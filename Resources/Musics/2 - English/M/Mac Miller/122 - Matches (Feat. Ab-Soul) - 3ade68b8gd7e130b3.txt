MATCHES (FEAT. AB-SOUL)

(Verso 1: Ab-Soul)
Ever since a nigga had recess
Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno
Damn that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut
On this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rabbit
I'm living too fast, sin is a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high
Still in high school, but I do
Everything I will do
When I'm 25, no lie

(Verso 2: Mac Miller)
I was young with ambition
Fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission
Went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes
Tell them all what they missing
While I watch as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death
Confident kid, I was trying to grow up with the best
Watching my step
Never know college but could find me 
nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from the Bachelor
Coulda been smart
Coulda been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, like she would've caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I got my own business
Then I got fame like what the fuck is this
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money
Back in high school none of the hoes was trying to fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts are scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they was looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a money heist scheme
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed

If you're 18 years and older
18 years and older
If you're 18 years and older
18 years and older

(Ab-Soul)
I will rule the world
Take care of my family and take care of my girl
Plant a couple seeds, blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be

18 years and older
