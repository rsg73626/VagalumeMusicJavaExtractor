FACE IN THE CROWD

Driving down the road only a couple more miles to go
I'm so close but they don't know
Got some freak hoes and weed to blow
Got the cleanest clothes
My life different from every single kid you know
Places I go and on my own
Hoes stay blowin' up my phone
But I wanna be left alone
Doin' shows here four five cities in a row
Hit me with some dough
Cause they know I'm bout to blow, oww, oww, oww
You can always say no if you wanna lay low
Girl you look so good 
You need to get up on the floor, oww, oww, oww

Don't you feel good
Don't you feel great
I feel so fly
And I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's same ol' dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But I'm just another face in the crowd
I said I'm just another face in the crowd

They tell me It's impossible to do it
I'd be stupid if I tried
But I'm using them to maneuver it
Keep on movin' them aside
I'm just trying to make some music for the ride
Listen to it when you drive
Destination you arrive
Russel Crowe just a beautiful mind
Got talent, Imagine what I'd do with some time
I'm givin' you a high feelin'
Movin' your spine
Usually find me chillin' up in Jupiter
I'm so happy when you mad
Some Khakis and I sag
Mom said You can see my ass
And she laughed
When I folded on the turn pike
Hoping I don't crash
Stashing the weed under the passenger seat
All these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me
People taking pictures when I pass in the street
Zoom by going fast in my seat belt
And now you know how weed felt

Don't you feel good
Don't you feel great
I feel so fly
And I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's same ol' dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But I'm just another face in the crowd
I said I'm just another face in the crowd

Don't you feel good
Don't you feel great
I feel so fly
And I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's same ol' dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But I'm just another face in the crowd
I said I'm just another face in the crowd
