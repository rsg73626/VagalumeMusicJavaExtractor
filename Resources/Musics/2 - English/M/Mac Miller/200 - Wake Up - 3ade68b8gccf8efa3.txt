WAKE UP

Go and ride with me
Get high with me
You lookin' fly with me
Go ride with me
Just vibe with me
Get high with me
In the sky with me
Go ride with me
Get high with me
Go ride with me

They tell me I'm the shit I'm like, duh?!
Girls on my dick I'm like, duh!?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup!
Wake the whole damn wolrd homie, I don't give a fuck
Young rich and famous thanks for asking how are you
Party every night that's exactly what I do

Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup!
Wake the whole damn world homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up

Hey, they say it's so funny your nobody with mo' money, and the hoes love me
And these other kids don't touch me
Full contact rap no rugby
Pretty boy flow while your girl so ugly
My bitches don't want anybody but me
They puff trees, sip liquor and suck dick
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters they bring my way
I let me grill though they can watch the money pile
While these groupie hoes try to hunt me down
Now everyday feelin like the best day ever
Heard it's a long road but it get way better
A lil' money in my pocket but my eyes on a million
Got these doubters listenin' surprised when they feel him
Ballin' like Jordan you ballin' like wilson
Feelin' like a kid again chillin' watchin' gilligan

I don't think they want to, interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

I don't think they want to, interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

Hey, hear the alarm time to start the day, rub my eyes, light some weed
Send my mind on it's way, I'm gone
Somewhere in my own dimension
I show these hoes no affection,
Just party every night gettin so demented
At that time I'm lookin' in the mirror seeing to reflection
Got me wondering why don't they get it
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way
The weed is twistin' you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin'
Gettin paid but my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause it was written on a page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get fucked up
I came to act wild
You came to prepare for the future
I live for right now

I don't think they want to, interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
