SOMEONE LIKE YOU

(3x)
Someone like
Someone like
Someone like
Someone like
Someone like
Someone like
Someone like
Someone like you
Someone like you

(Verso 1)
Uh, uh, yeah, light up till the pain gone
All I hear is the same song, when the radio yo came on
Fuck around and get waste dawg
Do this shit till the day I die
Are you ready, are you ready?
Terrified, but my hand is steady
Verified, get the camera ready
Carry my, own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep
Diving into this cold lake
Fuck a bitch till her toes shake, tellin' me, I'm her soul-mate
Misguide emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks
Dealing with it since '08, fucked around, oh I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to brace, 
when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of it's fun, spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinkin' logical, gettin' high, jump off the moon
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible, when the mine is so close
Came in for your money, then left with all of your hoes

(Refrão)
Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind
Stop forgetting what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone, woah
You hurt so good
Girl your lovin hurt so good

(Verso 2)
Uh, love me, love me
Then fittin' on ignore me
Beautiful to get ugly
Turn me into a junkey
I still search for something, but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet, same shit you did last week
For all the cash, you might've stood up 
And would've walked passed me
Wake me u? from this bad dream
Put a match to this gasoline
Every night with somebody different
Got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up, can't feel myself
Work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems that's real as hell
Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell
Gettin' high, put my mind away
Find the words to I'm tryin' to say
I'ma think of that later
When the world goes against you, when you get that paper

(Refrão)
Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind
Stop forgetting what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone, woah
You hurt so good
Girl your lovin hurt so good



Digo (:
