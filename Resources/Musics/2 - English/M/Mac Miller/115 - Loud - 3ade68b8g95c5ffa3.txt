LOUD

[Intro:]
Ladies and gentleman
This is Macadelic
Motherfucker
Hahahaha..

[Verso 1]
Ugh, I got codeine in my cup
You can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love
I'm like bitch you must be trippin'
I'm just tryna fuck
And she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck
And nothing I'ma change
Still roll up them blunts
Got diamonds in my chain
Yeah you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more
I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more
Play a number one spot on the Billboard
Yeah people lie
Numbers won't
Keep me high
Judges croak
Growing up
Pro Cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

[Refr達o]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes
If you did, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verso 2]
I'ma get that Grammy soon
Fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hear me shoot
No fuckin magazine
Hammer team, in that packer me
Hit a Jerm, be bangin' in the glass saline
When I went to every high school class would be
Tryna fuck the female faculty
I'ma crazy little fuck good thing my head don't run away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay
I just made a million dollars still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way
When you meet me, bitches stand up straight
Pump out raps
Yeah I got raps
Tryna talk shit what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I'ma lay low chill, till I let that stack
Ha, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Throwin up, pro cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

[Refr達o]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes
If you did, now you know, never keep your pockets low
