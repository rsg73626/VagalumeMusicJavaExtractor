DANG (FEAT. ANDERSON .PAAK)

I can't keep on losing you
Over complications
Gone too soon
Wait, we was just hangin'
I guess I need to hold onto, dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losing you, you, you, you, you, you
I can't keep on losing you, you, you, you, you, you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
When I'm left with my hand and my face all red
And a face looking at you like "wait"
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late well
I can't keep on losing you, I runaway so fast
Know my heart like gold but it break like glass
Knowing shit get old when I act so young
Baby you so cold, never have no son
You don't wanna grow up, you're the shit, no funds
So when I get home I'mma give you some
Make you feel like woo, when I hit that drum
Yeah the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me baby
You way too drunk, you don't know what I'm saying
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waiting
You say you don't care, is what you saying
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fighting, we be reuniting
Kiss me, tug me, tease me, me excited
Got the devil who is who
Couldn't get through to you because

I can't keep on losing you
Over complications
Gone too soon
Wait, we was just hangin'
I guess I need to hold onto, dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losing you

Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you

Well, you can't go away girl, I'mma need you
Play your games like
They my ticket to an ivy league school
Won't get hall of fame dick
From a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food
Only got a little time, I ain't tryna spend it
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
Starting up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I ain't used every bone in my body
Keep on holding on to your trust
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time it ain't much
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
Heartache drunk and hang up
What a mess I made us, sense I make none
It's complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it's seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dress is bulletproof
Say it for me girl

I can't keep on losing you
Where the hell you going?
Where you taking this trip to? wait!
Don't want stay too
I can't keep on losing you
Where the hell you going?
Wait
Where the hell you going?

I can't keep on losing you
Over complications
Gone too soon
Wait, we was just hangin'
I guess I need to hold onto, dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losing you

Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you
I can't keep losing you
