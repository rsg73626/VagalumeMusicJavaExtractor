CRUISE CONTROL

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Ayo I'm living the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed
Fine hoes all the things I'ma need
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gonna have 'em like
La la la la, la la la la la
Sit back relax and move slow
Cause we on cruise control

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Wizzle man, the fans can't keep them off me
Always reppin' for my city
Even though I don't see it often, yeah
As a youngin' learn it's best to keep from talkin'
I only say I'm the best cause that's what the people call me
And I'ma keep shining until the day the Reaper call me
A lot of shit on my chest so I suggest you keep from round me
Tryna slander my name but when you sit think about it
It's hard to show off your aim when n*ggas yet to see the target
He's talkin' that mess cause hes garbage
My trees rolled, beauty because the weed is foreign
And my homie bought a yacht so we on it and drinks are pourin'
Hoes admire my clothes cause I got Louis features on em
Life just like a movie plus the special features bonus
With bad b*tches and good weed to keep us coughing
Hard as a bed of nails you would be sleeping on

[Hook: Mac Miller]

La la la la, la la la la la
Sit back relax and move slow
Cause we on cruise control

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I got these motherf*ckers hating on the way the boy live
Probably cause ladies always that I'm the shit
People stay up on my dick
I ain't worried bout them I'm to focused on the money
I ain't worried bout friends
They say the youngin' dream like a king
I'm Mohammad Ali in the ring
Christmas Eve in the spring
Waiting for the boy, but I ain't 21
Wizzle cutting up cause I stay puffin blunts
And when the money come, I'ma give it back
Got a driver who addresses me as Mr. Mac
Dealing with these diva hoes, they so demanding
Mac a young superstar, Dakota Fanning
And you know I'm planning for the world to be mine
No blind dates but I'm hitting girls from behind
The type of shine stay turnin' 'em blind
Just cruisin' smokin' purp and recline

[Hook: Mac Miller]
