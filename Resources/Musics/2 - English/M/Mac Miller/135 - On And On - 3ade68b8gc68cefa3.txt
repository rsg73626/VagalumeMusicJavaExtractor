ON AND ON

Hey,
I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the rooftop what's gon' break my fall
I think I might I go on and on forever, on and on
I think his could go on and on forever, on and on
I wanna walk into the store
I'll take everything and more
I wanna travel round the world
Places I ain't been before
I think I might go on and on forever, on and on
I think this could go on and on forever, on and on

I be riding in my car with the music all the way up
See me shining I'mma star take a picture see you later
I've been up some baby shit and everytime I wake up
Gotta head back to reality but reality is greater
Than you could ever imagine you say that you pull up
But im better at rapping forever the captain
I'll be making music out of joystick, thumbs up
Joint lit y'all get what the point is
Baby I'm here I ain't, going nowhere
All these haters say im faking but I really don't care
Got my teammate right beside me you know where to find me
Burgh representative, I need y'all behind me cause

I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the rooftop what's gon' break my fall
I think I might I go on and on forever, on and on
I think his could go on and on forever, on and on
I wanna walk into the store
I'll take everything and more
I wanna travel round the world
Places I ain't been before
I think I might go on and on forever, on and on
I think this could go on and on forever, on and on

One day I'm gonna get mine too
And I think that's sometime soon
Whatever you got in your crib
I'm gonna get it times two
If I win or lose what the fuck I gotta prove
I've been living out my dream everything I saw came true
Travel on a tour before screaming fans
Got a stellar reputation girl be who I am
I'm gonna be the man, sir, connecting people everywhere
Like Samsung gotta shoot around the back alley oop and one
This the championship game you ready yo
You don't sound ready better scream it just to let 'em know
My team mate right beside me
You know where to find me
Burgh representative, I need y'all behind me

I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the rooftop what's gon' break my fall
I think I might I go on and on forever, on and on
I think his could go on and on forever, on and on
I wanna walk into the store
I'll take everything and more
I wanna travel round the world
Places I ain't been before
I think I might go on and on forever, on and on
I think this could go on and on forever, on and on
