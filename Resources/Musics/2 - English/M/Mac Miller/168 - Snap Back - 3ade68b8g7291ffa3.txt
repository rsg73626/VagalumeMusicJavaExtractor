SNAP BACK

Had some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored
Had some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback
Had some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored

Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback

Uh, I used to rock a double XL
Now the ladies all say I dress well
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Mizou
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes
Pocket stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff
Pack of Gum Squares, BlackBerry and a phone clip
Got Most Dope Clique, bunch of motherfuckers lookin' fresh
Crooks and castle dress
Sl-sl-sloppy haters shouldn't mess
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath
You was just baby, crying til you was shook to death (bitch)
Fade away like an etch-e-sketch
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed
Text hoes we're less clothes then her mama like
Church girl always go to school she the honest type
But when it comes to boys she like 'em bad
So holla at the kid I got swag

Nic nac paddy whack give that boy some clothes
Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes
Snap back, flat cap, abstract swagga
Kid come correct never messin' up the pattern
Y'all Jigsaw puzzle
Mismatch mess, got my J's on with some jeans lookin fresh
Yes my colors match
And I ain't no other cat lookin the kid
Yeah none of y'all fuck with Mac
You rockin' something that lookin' like a lumberjack
How you wearin' 3 different t shirts under that?
Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest
Nothin' on me lookin' childish
Fire talk, I am hot
Y'all is just some mild sauce
Got my clothes tailored
Fits so nicely
Soon you'll see these motherfuckers dressin' just like me
