WHAT'S THE USE?

You can love it, you can leave it
And say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it? There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck up little, what's the use?
Never superficial you don't know it when it hit you
With a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

Yeah, okay we colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem what it is what it truly might be
Nothing that you know of, you don't need to hol' up
I'm so above from beyond you take drugs to make it up
Way up where we on, space shuttle, Elon
Time we don't waste much, fuck and we wake up
Then have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you never catch me damn
Whole lotta yes I am
All the way in with no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is ticking
Come take a ride, get inside, this is highly different
I'm talking fly like a pilot would
Can I mind my business? Why you trippin'?
Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, too close
I don't understand why you doing the most

You can love it, you can leave it
And say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it? There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck up little
What's the use? What's the use?
Never superficial you don't know it when it hit you
With a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

When I'mma give you what you came for, yeah
Shoulda perk too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far but par we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cuz I save the day spendin' money
When I had nothing shit it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worried my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun get up outta my shade
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of my frame, shit
I'm up 30 thou miles plus change
Spend a while but I'm down 'till I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't

You can love it, you can leave it
And say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it? There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck up little
What's the use? What's the use?
