SHE SAID

Aha, ay look
Hey, well I was riding in shotgun, speeding down the highway
Listening to music, haven't slept in like five days
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real I swear to God this shit pretend tho'
Cause me I get high and make music for a living
If that ain't the best job then give me your opinion
Cause I love life, chilling for the night, case of budlight
Small world for me but you, you live a bugs life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine love it, grimier then rubbish
You softer then a snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist
Never eating beats on your thug shit
Come with all the swagger but you lacking all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school spending money,
drinking liquor, naked girls up in my pool

[Refr達o]
Wake up in my bed gettin' head she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start, if you didn't make mistakes you wouldn't get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try

Ayo my herb smoke tasting like a nerds row
Bout to get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Something like a millionaire in training
Still my shit amazing we jumpin over puddles when its raining
Planning on a tan I'm in the sand and where we jam and make it bounce
While we dancing on the clouds until I'm landing on my house
Remember when moms would hate me standing on the couch
But now I'm making so much money I start to lose count
I try to spend it quick I got bills though
Ya I'm only eighteen I got skills though
Beats rhymes life tribe called chilled flow
You been rapping twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect the riches is the art
I'm just made at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this cause we love it and its setting us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark
