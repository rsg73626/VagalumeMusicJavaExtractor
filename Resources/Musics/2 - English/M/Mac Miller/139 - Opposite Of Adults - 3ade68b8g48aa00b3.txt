OPPOSITE OF ADULTS

Don't control yourself! 
This your life you own it, said you own it. 
So live it up.
All that matters is this moment 
so who's coming, don't control yourself. 
This your life you own it, said you own it. 
So live it up, all that matters is this moment
so who's coming, don't control yourself.

All I got is a dream come true, everybody
wonder what we gonna do. 
Drink in the red cup, pre roll ten blunts, when 
I go to sleep I don't think Imma get up. 
Stay in bed till the afternoon, cause you know 
what us rappers do, get high, get drunk,
Then find some butt, girl, I wanna chase after you. 
Let's live it up, live it up, party like we ain't got shit to do. 
I don't give a fuck, give a fuck, nothing but cuttin up with the crew. 
My parents out of town so we gonna put it down.
We taking shots, who can go another round?

Don't control yourself, 
This your life you own it,said you own it. 
So live it up. All that matters is this moment so who's
coming, don't control yourself. 
This your life you own it, said you own it. 
So live it up, all that matters is this moment,
so who's coming, don't control yourself.

Hey, I wake and shit, the first thing Imma do is take a hit. 
Tonights gonna be great, let's get a little drink, 
I'm trying to get wasted bitch.
Its gonna be something to remember, too bad we won't, won't,
and it's gonna get hot in here so, don't bring your coat, coat. 
Take your clothes off, we gonna get crazy.
She's sort a fine, just borderline, 
but tonight she's gonna be my lady! 
My parents out of town so we gonna put it down.
We taking shots, who can go another round? 

Don't control yourself, 
This your life you own it,said you own it. 
So live it up.
All that matters is this moment so who's coming, 
don't control yourself. 
This your life you own it, said you own it. 
So live it up, all that matters is this moment
so who's coming, don't control yourself.
