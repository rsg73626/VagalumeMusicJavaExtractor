STAY

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while
Just a, just a little while

Yeah, hold up, wait a motherfuckin' second
I know you stressin'
You don't gotta keep me guessin'
I'm full of questions
In return I get the silent treatment
I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'?
I could have a whole collection
Just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated
I swear that pussy grammy nominated
Let's make some music
Fuck all of the bullshit

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while
Just a, just a little while

Okay now, baby
Don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me
Meditate me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I
Ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin'
For another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playing' hard to get
I read between her lines
Binge watched "sopranos"
Made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come
See her freaky side, leavin' me behind

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while
Just a, just a little while
Just a little while
Just a little while, babe

The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home
Where the fuck you gon' go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walkin'
To the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home
Where the fuck you gon' go, girl?

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
Just a little while
Just a little while
Just a, just a little while
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home
Where the fuck you gon' go?
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home
Where the fuck you gon' go?
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while
Just a little while
Just a, just a little while

Will you
Will you
Will you
