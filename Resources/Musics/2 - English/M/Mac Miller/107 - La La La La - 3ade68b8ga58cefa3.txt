LA LA LA LA

I'm goin' in after hittin' this Ganja
Out to dinner with the homies, private table at the Comma
I'm a, new millennium Sinatra
Coppin' marijuana from the neighborhood Rasta
Chiefin', feastin', king of the new school
I'm speakin' in tongues try translatin' voodoo
Hold up, let me start again
Undefeated shirt, Levis, and a Mr. Rogers cardigan

It's a hell of a feelin': bein' this fresh
Spit seem to sit upon my lips call it Blistex
Peddlin' this medical, the presence of a general
Magazine centerfolds they all up on my genitals
Got the game in the palm of my hands
Attention; wylin' out better talk to your man
He bitchin'; cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos
Talkin' shit all up in my ear lobes

I just live life, tryin' do it right
Everyone that hear me say the boy is super nice
Put a bitch up on the flight, she gunna be here by the night
Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe
Call me Stanely Steemer, I'll be givin' her the pipe
When I'm out of town she wanna see me so we Skype
She might get obsessed and keep callin'
Thirty thousand feet Tom Petty, Free Fallin'
Just, layin' back lettin' gravity take it's course

I wanna tell all of my haters the we made it boy
From basement studios to some official shit
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit
Used to dream about it, boy now I'm living it
Four, one, two, is the most dope syndicate
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it
Try and spend money just to spend it is ridiculous, young and so mischievous, bitches is...

La, la, la, la
La, la
La, la, la
La, Laa
La, Laaaaaaaa
La, Laaaaaaaa

La, la, la, la

La, la, la
La, Laa
