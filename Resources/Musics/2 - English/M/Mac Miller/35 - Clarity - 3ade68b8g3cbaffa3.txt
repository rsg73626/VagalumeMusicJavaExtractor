CLARITY

Clarity
Clarity...
Clarity...

Figure all this out, I ain't gonna take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect, I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin', towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activist
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for, I hope you found what you lookin' for

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
I'ma be waitin' for that

Misery, you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere, your epiphany
Disconnect, from everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet, is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around, chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliche but I can't tell you what it means to me

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
I'ma be waitin' for that
