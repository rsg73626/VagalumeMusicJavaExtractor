LOVE MY NAME

Baby if I don't have money (what)
Then I don't have a heart beat (that's right)
I know you gone love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
(see the neon lights)
In the neon lights
(see the neon lights)
In the neon lights
I know you gone love my name
I know you gone love my name

I usually write rhymes in the blackberry
But I went back to the pen for this one
So ima let my fingers do the talkin'
And she probably what they talkin bout (uhg huh)
Girl you got to listen (uhhh)
Im in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'
And im losin' all my patience
I just need a vacation(vacation)
Your friends all player hatin'(what?)
Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with and spend the day with
Always wanna walk ya home
And you hate the way my day to day is on the road (it's okay)
Front row know every single song
When she know she comin' home with me she always bring her thong
Bring her lingerie whatever moods she in
But a movie in
Got the lights dim
We gone make love til nights end
Have you callin up ya friends like oww I like him

Baby if I don't have money (what)
Then I don't have a heart beat (that's right)
I know you gone love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
(see the neon lights)
In the neon lights

In the neon lights
I know you gone love my name
I know you gone love my name

I know I take ya breath away darling
Smooth playa treat you like a princess (uh huh)
Cause love tricky like parallel parking (ah hah)
A business I wont invest
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours
Givin' you flavors that you aint even taste before
We gone make love til you achin' sore (achin' sore)
And baby don't worry ima be rich
Name in the neon lights (in the neon lights)
So how about you give me that kiss
Cause you don't want to sleep tonight
Your one night love gone get swept off ya feet
Yeah lets get undressed from your breast to ya feet (breast to ya feet)
Light a cigarette just to stay awake
Liquor got us bangin like a 808

Baby if I don't have money (what)
Then I don't have a heart beat (that's right)
I know you gone love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
