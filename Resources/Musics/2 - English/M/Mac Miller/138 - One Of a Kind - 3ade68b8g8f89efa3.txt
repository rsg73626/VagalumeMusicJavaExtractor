ONE OF A KIND

Ain't nothin' else like me

I ain't nothing like you so what, is going on? 
There must be something wrong 
You'll love me when I'm gone 
Imma keep on doing me, 'cause you 
Don't even matter and you 
You just an actor and I 
Just ain't a rapper, no 
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind

Here's a prototype that I know you'll like, right
Headin' to the light on an overnight flight 
Never in your life you gonna see another me 
I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double D's 
I'm near, not the same, I'm a pioneer 
Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear 
Trying to see success goddamn it's clear 
'Cause I shine like a chandelier 
I'm going through this case 
Spitting 'bout what to relate 
Never can you duplicate 
Any of the music made 
Gettin' super paid 
Lookin' at our future star 
They always recognize me when I pass 'em in a moving 
car
Always worried about finding out who you are 
To know somebody you gotta look into his heart 
Your mind so blind I'm ahead of my time
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind

I ain't nothing like you so what, is going on? 
There must be something wrong 
You'll love me when I'm gone 
Imma keep on doing me, 'cause you 
Don't even matter and you 
You just an actor and I 
Just ain't a rapper, no 
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind

And my pops said young man, you ain't ready for the 
world ahead 
Way too much marijuana, always havin' girls in bed 
You gonna realize life ain't a party 
Fuck around you gon' end up starving
Fuck it I stay fly, live free, die hard
No Bruce Willis this the whole nine yards 
Thought that I can rhyme bars go and buy cars 
You gotta grind hard once the sunrise start 
And my heart great things in my future 
'Cause broke rappers, shit that's just a rumour, 
I see the diamond chains mansions in the videos 
They must got silly dough,
Do they really though?
Or is it all just a scam for your eyes 
Are you in disguise, goddamn I can't decide
All these words here come from my mind
Got nothing to hide boy I'm one of a kind.

Walking through this world I just take a look around 
Ain't nobody here like me 
Don't nobody got my style 
People say I'm different I sure you that's okay
'Cause I'm way past tomorrow and you stuck in today

I ain't nothing like you so what, is going on? 
There must be something wrong 
You'll love me when I'm gone 
Imma keep on doing me, 'cause you 
Don't even matter and you 
You just an actor and I 
Just ain't a rapper, no 
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
I'm one of a kind
