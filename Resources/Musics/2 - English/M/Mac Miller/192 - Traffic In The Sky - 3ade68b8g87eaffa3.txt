TRAFFIC IN THE SKY

Recently it seem like every where we go
The drinks stay cold where we coolin', coolin'
Being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tunin'
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgettin to call
Get away to California when the weathers gettin' colder
My honey's by the pool and umbrellas and mimosas
Chillin at the beach house loungin' on the sofa
Try to where the cheuffer on my way to blow up
Stoner, roll up, fishin, champagne sippin'
Five star chefs they cookin' in the kitchen
But makin only the good shit,
See the way I'm livin' they like oh my goodness

I tell em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And baby all we got is time
Let's just watch the clouds go by, ah, ah, ah, ah

And the rain no need to panic
Girl we can lay up on this hamic
No need to pose here
Everythings candid
Livin' in the moment
Feelin' so splendid
Bottles on me you can put it on the debit
I'm just tryin' to have fun tonight
So everybody went chung tonight
Girl we can fall in love tonight
Cause trust me I'm a fuck you right
Got my Louis shades on
Ain't a damn thing wrong
Fillin' up cups till the bottle all gone
We just coolin', coolin', feel the breeze
Decide to give you something you can sing off key like
La, lala, lala, lala, la, lala, lala, lala
I'll be puffin that
La, lala, lala, lala, la, lala, lala, lala

I tell em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And baby all we got is time
Let's just watch the clouds go by, ah, ah, ah, ah

Yeah, haha
That's that smooth shit Jerm
That pimp shit dude
Oh yeah
Thumbs up
Aha
