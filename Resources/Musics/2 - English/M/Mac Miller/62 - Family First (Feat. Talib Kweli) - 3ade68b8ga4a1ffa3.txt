FAMILY FIRST (FEAT. TALIB KWELI)

[Mac Miller]
Dealing with everybody's opinion
Trying to do me
Only down one, I'm in the final
Shooting threes
Like I don't give a fuck
Music we fuck andswitch the position up
We love the things that keep on
Bringing out the kids in us

Been working all my life to do some different stuff
For people to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
To say I haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
And she thinks I'm going Hollywood
I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade but I can see the sun, cool
I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spending cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks

See me from the treetops
They worry but they need not
Heating like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool cause I got a pair of shoes
A mug dog, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny
So no Four Loco
They should know, so

I could go slow, you see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me
They study what I do now
With some help from Kweli
And it's Like on the they
Its cool to say my cypher complete

[Talib Kweli]

Word
I'm so sick with the verbs I use
The words to heal us
They love how I kill it on stage, man
Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bug asleep in the coffin
Dead tired
Exhausted from how often I be touring

So gangsta, Like the occupation of Made Men
Creating chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped the Frank changeover
We add a Mac to the wolfpack: hangover
That Hen is not a friend
I'm on that Lager of lent
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
You not a kid no more

Don't want to hold your hand and fall off
And make you shoulder-lean like you dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham reading all the signs
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam
Cause it's all we really have here
