Yeah
I be eatin' that Pink Slime
Haha, here we go

Got my chick makin' drinks with that cream, while I'm takin' sips of that lean
Life ain't a bitch if you make a wish, you might break a record like me
Got a mill at age nineteen, but I may just give that back
To show my friends I could do it again if I started all from scratch
All I do is rap, run and tell them hoes that
Pipe like a plumber, It's nice with no rubber, she like when I fuck her like that
This raps what I do, but I been fly, been fly
Your now inside of my sick mind, that Pink Slime, that Pink Slime

She get good grades, suck a dick, what more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck, what more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love, what more could ask for?
What more could you ask for, w-what more could you ask for?

Go a hundred miles an hour, ride around the city
Smokin' on that Sour, couple bad ones with me
Used to rock all my brother's clothes
Now designer brands, got a bunch of those
Got a bunch of diamonds and a bunch of gold
Ridin' by the cops, I'm like fuck em' though
Hoes turn bent for that Hermes, I'm bustin' nuts on her fur vest
My life's like a circus, my heads a little unfurnished
She on a roll, she Dean's list, her ass round like Venus
My penis, her cleavage, that freaky bitch need Jesus

She get good grades, suck a dick, what more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck, what more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love, what more could ask for?
What more could you ask for, w-what more could you ask for?

I'm switchin' up my flows, sellin' out these shows
Pop a bottle a Dom P, then spill it all on my clothes
Man, Mac so grown, made a business all on my own
These labels callin' my phone, but I made this business all on my own
Give me that bass bitch, I'm a bass head, let it break shit til it make a mess
I wrote myself another blank check, I'm fuckin it', need a AIDS test
Win the Heisman, I'm MVP, Dan Marino, you Sandusky
MC Hammer, they can't touch me, Skateboard P, he be on that beat

She get good grades, suck a dick, what more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck, what more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love, what more could ask for?
What more could you ask for, w-what more could you ask for?
