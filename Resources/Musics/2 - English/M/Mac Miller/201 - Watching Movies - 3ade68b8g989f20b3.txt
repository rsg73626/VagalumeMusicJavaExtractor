WATCHING MOVIES

Yo all your bitches got the green bow
Yep

People worship these idols
'Til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples
You get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket (Woah)
Think it's time for a revolution
Me and my dawgs 'bout to start a riot
You still there sleeping when I'm eating
You and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off home improvement
Tell the... we going stupid
This some new shit

Hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis
Bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music
Get this money, share the profits
Now this class getting led by students
Smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out all underground
They didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money I'm hunting it down
Planting the seeds
Working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight
I just thought you should know
Been on my grind, taking whats mine
I got my eyes on the throne
I'mma be fine, no matter the time
We all go along with the show

That girls beautiful, somebody introduce me
She aint your girl tonight, naw that bitch a groupie
There some money in the building better give it to me
See you staring at me like you in the movies
Now you watching movies
Looking at my life just like you watching movies
Looking at my life just like you watching movies
Looking at my life just like yiou watching movies

People worship these idols
'Til they come in contact with god
Hoes is on my disciples
You get mind-fucked by these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket
Woah, fuck a day job, fuck a day job
Got your bitch hittin' just just a tank top
Gettin' paid, blow my face off
Bitch your bank fraud, Bernie Madoff
Education, interracial
LL Cool J without the Kangol
I don't see the need to stunt
Wish you the best, I'mma just light up this blunt

This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my dick could win the Heisman
Yeah I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, that's a lot of bookies
My bitch is gorgeous looking imported
From the short of Brooklyn
Coming from out of the 'Burgh, bitch I'm absurd
Fuck you up, hope you insured
Hatin', I'll just give you what you deserve that's my word
Put it all on my worth
Chin on my grind, taken what's mine
I got my eyes on the throne
I'mma be fine, no matter the time
We all go along with the show yo
