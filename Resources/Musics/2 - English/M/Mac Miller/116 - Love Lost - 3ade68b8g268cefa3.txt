LOVE LOST

(Our love was lost)
Where?d you go, and what?d you do
How the hell you make me fall in love with you
(But now we found it)
And then you leave, and now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you cross, your heart)
So I can feel but I cant touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I wont deny it)
Broke my heart cant find no crush
So why don?t you just come on back home?

Hey, I'm a fucking workaholic, with a passion in my heart
Treating rappin' as an art in which you'd have to be a part of
I just copped a new car to hear it start up
Try to do the right thing then please karma
All I want to know is where the fuck did you have to go
I been waiting on you baby, why don?t you leave and come on home
I cant be mad I'm living my dream (going all around the globe)
Although you said you think you love me (you need to let me know)
So I been fucking all these hoes
And I been blowing all this cash
'Cause baby this just the beginning
And I'ma make all of it back

(Our love was lost)
Where?d you go, and what?d you do
How the hell you make me fall in love with you
(But now we found it)
And then you leave, and now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you cross, your heart)
So I can feel but I cant touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I wont deny it)
Broke my heart cant find no crush
So why don?t you just come on back home?

Hey, hey, its all good everybody tryna eat tonight
Tryna go to sleep having good dreams tonight
So go home, it might get better
All I know it don?t last forever
So take it while you got it tryna get a little more
They say I'm getting better than I ever been before
Well that?s for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap keep me fed like a school getting soup
I been out here on the road and now they missin' me at home
All these ex girls that I used to know are hittin up my phone
But I ain't here, I guess you can call back
Sex drugs and rock 'n' roll I think ill take all that

(Our love was lost)
Where?d you go, and what?d you do
How the hell you make me fall in love with you
(But now we found it)
And then you leave, and now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you cross, your heart)
So I can feel but I cant touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I wont deny it)
Broke my heart cant find no crush
So why don?t you just come on back home?
