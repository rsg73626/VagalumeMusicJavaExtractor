PLAY YA CARDS RIGHT

[Intro:]
Uhhh, yeah, little old school shit

[Refrão:]
So she came up to me and asked my name,
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games,
If you wanna come home with me tonight,
You better play, ya cards, right

[Verso 1:]
I came to rock right now,
I'm the best and I came to get down,
I've been know to rock a microphone,
She got a boyfriend but left him home,
See I got style, so yes I brag,
The things I do just make them mad,
Download new pics to my iPad,
Why your girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag?
You a fab, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda,
My name's something these girls remember,
She write hers down, return to sender,
I don't need it, vicky she can keep her secrets,
One night only, that's how I treat this, sleeping,
Bitch please, make me some breakfast,
And then leave

[Refrão:]
So she came up to me and asked my name,
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no game,
If you wanna come home with me tonight,
You better play, ya cards, right

So she came up to me and asked my name,
I said it's funky Mac, don't play no game,
If you wanna come home with me tonight,
You better play, ya cards, right

[Verso 2:]
Hey, you see I came to rock right now,
I'm the best and I came to get down,
I've been know to rock a microphone,
Girls audition to bring them home,
See I might choose, so just go with it,
Her mom adores me, dad thinks I'm a nitwit,
That don't really matter, I'm a have her fall in love,
I need my booty, brain, booty, and she all of the above,
Relationships, I hate that shit,
Got one night only, so make it quick,
You see me out, wanna take a pic
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit.
I ain't that rich, but I got bread,
To make a sandwich, get me fed,
Decide right now, don't got all night,
This the life, so play ya cards right

[Refrão:]
So she came up to me and asked my name,
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no game,
If you wanna come home with me tonight,
You better play, ya cards, right

So she came up to me and asked my name,
I said it's funky Mac, don't play no game,
If you wanna come home with me tonight,
You better play, ya cards, right
