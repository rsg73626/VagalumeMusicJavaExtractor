OUTSIDE

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
We outside, We outside (Hey, Hey, Hey)

I wake up, throw on some clothes and out the door I won't be back
My shinin' sun horizon settin up a lovely backdrop
My life's a topic of a lullabye
(Ah) A breath of fresh air, is something right
I don't wanna be inside today,
just keep it rollin like we ridin' skates
I got a happy of haze.
I'm thinkin we gon' get high today,
And let the sun shine all in my face.

Oh yeah this life is good, don't let it all go to waste
Just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case.
Yeah, free livin', I swear, I be on some hippie shit.
But gettin way fresher than the hippies is.

I got the, the gift of gab, somethin that you wish you had,
Don't even get a strap naw I'd rather kick a rap
Enjoy the place that you livin' at stay around
We just some kids and this world is a playground

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
We could post outside for the night

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
We outside, outside

When I be on some kid shit, gon take my shorty on a picnic
And everyday feelin like it's Christmas
the kinda weather had by people livin' so priviledged

I know the Lord Take, today he was tryna giveth

Hey, hey, ey, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day,
We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May,
Rain, Rain, Go away, Waitin for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way.

Little kids runnin' through the streets playin,
Papi on the porch he ain't got time to waste it.
He's just a old man in the sea, Ernest Hemmingway,
Elevate, look up in the sky starin Heaven Space.
Second grade, holdin down the corner slangin' lemonade,
Everyday hustlin', you ridin' down penny lane.
You ain't gonna get a day like this,
so put the rest of your troubles with that goodnight kiss

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
We could post outside for the night

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
We outside, outside

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
We could post outside for the night

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cuz' it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right
