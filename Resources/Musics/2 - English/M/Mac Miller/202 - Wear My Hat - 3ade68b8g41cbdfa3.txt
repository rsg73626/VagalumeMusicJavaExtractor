WEAR MY HAT

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,
But now she think she got it like that,
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,
Mmm I think she think she got it like that,

Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back,
Baby you could wear my hat,
If you got somethin' to match,

Baby you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back,
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap,
Then we could go outside, let me take you for a ride
With the top down show you off to people you my prize,

Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes,
Shinin' like my high beams cooler than some ice tea,
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email,
Professional with shop and you would think she worked at retail,

Snapbacks make 'em look so cute, and that girl know how to blow
Somethin' like she played the flute,
That long hair and it's fallin' down her back,
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it,

Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch,
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can't have this,
She smiled big, kissin' on my cheek,
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me

Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back,
Baby you could wear my hat,
If you got somethin' to match,

Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that

She like to play her stupid games with me,
She never seem to have enough,
She brought some friends for whoever came with me,
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up,

And I hear her name's pretty from different continent
Tellin' me she's single but to tell the truth I'm not convinced,
It's all good I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit,
Thinkin' that they players but I'm coach call me Popovich,

Baby I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night,
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right,
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight,
And we ain't seen her since so tell me what does that look like,

I'm the type to bring you right back down to earth,
And for what it's worth I'll put that Louis on your purse,
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I'm guessin' she a keeper,
I think she stole it though I keep tryin' to reach her

Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back,
Baby you could wear my hat,
If you got somethin' to match,

Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,
But now she think she got it like that,
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,
Damn, I think she think she got it like that
