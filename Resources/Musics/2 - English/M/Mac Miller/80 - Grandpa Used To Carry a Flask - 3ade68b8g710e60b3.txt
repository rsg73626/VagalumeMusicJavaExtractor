GRANDPA USED TO CARRY A FLASK

What happens when I'm suicidal, vibrations up through my spinal
from the hits to the vinyl, my mind will be in the bible
I will see the signs and I'll probably not understand a lot
rode around town yesterday, straight from camelot
the prayers are not in common language, they don't mean a thing
the evil king of underworlds accumulating bodies
this rap shit is turning into nothing but a hobby
cuase' the pussy has already been fucked or in the lobby waiting

dominating the matrix kick it with God and satan
isolation through my veins, into these constellations
drug users, they won't let us join the club
so now it's spanish bitch massage, give my joints a rub
what's the purpose of everything, who the fuck cares?
we run scared, cause nothing fair and we don't become aware
pretend it don't exist, ignorance, the only bliss

I think it's me, well I hope it is
but no kids and no responsibilities, I'm writing soliloquies
and transcend visually, the intelligent idiots who never be serious
cause the world around is fucked up, so we'd rather get fucked up
(my grandpa used to carry a flask)
as I'm pacing back and forth, waiting till they pass the torch
life a bitch, about forty and a sad divorce, voice is hoarse
getting harder to speak, remarkable themes

talk mark to the beast
I saw them caught on the leash, we walk in common asleep
and coffins talking to steven hawking, even we see it often
so we close our eyes, hoping we forgot to die
shit it must have slipped my mind, why
well, I haven't seen a genuine smile in awhile
mostly everybody stuck in denial

so I'm coming out of cryogenics just to taste the air
you ain't aware... I'm talking about natalie the cattle eater
with nasty features
rapping with a flaccid wiener (shit), that's only half a peter
taking out the dogs, murder half a pita
(no, no humus with that)
yeah, look, having conversations
with myself, getting into arguments

when I'm out in london, I be posted at the parliament
coke in the parliaments, chilling by some monuments
ominous when I feel your body with godly hollow tips
leave you holy, prepare for the apocalypse
sixty thousand on a rollie, cookies with the chocolate chips
rapping hippopotamus, mother fuck a zookeeper
I don't do features, I snort glue and shoot ether
hand full of sleeping pills, it's only me I kill
I'm jack, wanna sleep with jill, she'd spill on my penis drill

mr. Jesus can you save my life (yeah, yeah)
looking at a mans casket (turn him into ham salad)
how I'm feeling fantastic (the finish line, I ran past it]
bitches love me because I got a tan phallus (get your house sandblasted)
your damn ass kicked (damn, gladys)
another fans ballad (and I demand gadgets at the sand palace)
for away I amtrak it (my safe is great, a saint can't crack it)
came through swagging in a all tan wagon
with the land of the dragons, I just stand for the balance
I'm just trying to play with my band on fallon, I don't got no talent
he's not dead, he's just delicious
