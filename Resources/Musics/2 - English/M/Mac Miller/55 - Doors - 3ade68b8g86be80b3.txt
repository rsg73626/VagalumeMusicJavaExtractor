DOORS

I know it's been a minute since I been awake
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
They saying that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just running kind of late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows
Lost track of time, I'm coming home
You know my mind, places it goes
When it goes, when it goes

It's only a game, don't be afraid
These doors will close, and people change
One day you'll go, right now you're here
No please just hear, don't disappear

Good morning, baby
