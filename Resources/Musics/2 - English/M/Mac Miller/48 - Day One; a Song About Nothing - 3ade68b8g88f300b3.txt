DAY ONE; A SONG ABOUT NOTHING

I made this beat 
Uh
Yeah 
Alright I now wrote to it to 
So would go like this 
It's like 
Really late and Jerm's tryin' to get home 
So I'mma try and one take a motherfuckin' song 

Uh, uh, uh, when you first start rapping everybody curious 
Then you make it happen and everybody furious 
Young kid Curdy is, don't know where the worry is 
Wanna be burried in my Pittsburgh Jersey bitch 
Nobody certain if you gonna make it 
Life give you some hurtin' and gonna hate it 
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked 
But, one thing for certain I'mma leave it fate is 
Still young but I'm wonder when my time could be up 
My time come I'mma smiling peace up 
Shorty sipping forties hanging out by the tree stump 
So Jerm and me sorta making heads and it occured to me 
You didn't have to be like thirty three to start earning cheese 
Without certainty in for eternity 
Alot of style, a little money and some purple wig 
Me and my queen my girl, not Freddy Mercury 
?Cause first word for free, anything that getting older 
Stand focus 'cause bullshit it was hopeless 
So treat yourself like a damn professional 
Your first music check, damn incredible 
Every day feel like the best day ever 
?Til every day feel like the best day ever 
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine 
You have it bad, wouldn't fuck up a good dream 
You realize that you'll probably be away when 
All the people die and you never get to say 
And everything you always wanted to 
but never got the chance to 
Start to weigh you down, what can a a man do 
I could've stayed around, probably can 
Sold a couple of shows, spend the last two years 
being down on the road 
I guess, haven't got to spend too much in my hometown 
Is what you make up a play, don't be mistaken 
All of you shook can take it, 
Broken beaten and wasted 
Still I wouldn't traded, and it was five o'clock 
But my mind won't stop 
I've been thinking 'bout life pour syrop on pop 
Smoke a cigarettes, it's like I'm really trying to die 
Trying to keep my head on my shoulders 
But my mind in the sky 
I'm that moment when a gazelle and a lion collide 
I'm a burned down doodle with a dominant side 
Yup, independent platinum, wish you well passing 
Juvi out of the ice age, bitch outta max ?em 
I'll be right in this shit and just relaxin' 
Let the time start passing 

Yeah 
So I just make my own beat 
And decided I was gonna rap one or two 
It's like, yup, took my chains off to rap this song 
Uh, almost dropped my Big Jerm, hahahah
Uh, who ever tought that I'd be standing in a booth with a big chain 
Guys I'm joking I don't have a verse 
Alright P
