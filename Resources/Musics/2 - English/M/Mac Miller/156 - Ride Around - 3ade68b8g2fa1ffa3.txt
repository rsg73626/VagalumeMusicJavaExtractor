RIDE AROUND

Ridin with the windows down 
Rollin thru the city 
Got the weed goin around 
And the Most Dope with me, hey 
Simply gettin high 
Like its nineteen sixty nine
I'mma be grindin 
Till the kid a hundred sixty
New York, Atlanta too
Flyer then Santa's shoes 
She bring her camera thru
I'm playing Crash Bandicoot, 
This be the bitch got some cock to serve her
I'm a rape the game no Roethlisberger, hey 
Above the clouds seeing stars like L.A 
Have your girl always coming back like Elway
Im'a be rich thats what they tell me
So let me start working with this paper like an essay, hey 
Athleticism working game when I'm getting women
The freshed lennon like I'm spitting thru your television
In a day dream living while these minutes pass me by
Lean back and hang these Nikes out the ride
Just, 

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just trying to ride around, cause we don't give a fuck 
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey lets just hit the road 

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just trying to ride around, cause we don't give a fuck 
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey lets just hit the road 

Rocking cacky colored jeans, and a plain white T 
Nike watch, Pow chain, spend a day like me, hey
Everyday like a movie scene
Smoking weed eyes glued to the computer screen,
I'm super duper ski, riding in the Civic (uh) 
Just got some speakers now I'm trying to get it tinted
Every dream vivid, talking how I live it
Up in the air playing 'quidditch', bitches
This is, once in a life time
They gunna put me in a flight no price line
Used to want to be a Marvel fighting crimes
Till I realized the boy had the nicest rhymes

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just trying to ride around, cause we don't give a fuck 
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey lets just hit the road

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just trying to ride around, cause we don't give a fuck 
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey lets just hit the road
