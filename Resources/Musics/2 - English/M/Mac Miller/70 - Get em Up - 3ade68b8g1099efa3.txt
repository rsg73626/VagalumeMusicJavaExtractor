The wheels stay spinnin on the Civic boy im always on the move
When you grindin all the time theres alot of shit to do
Thats why I got Q cus he keeps me on the routine
I be 2 ski tryna kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes boy new feet, and Im never in the car with only 2 seats
I got a whip full of people all fresh call em 10 deep.. motherfuckers we the future like next week.
Young people don't see you as an equal they just see you as decietful tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin one shot no redo,
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue,
Bitch, who the fuck you playin with,

Here to take whats theirs treat em all like Taylor Swift,
Leave em in a daze all like what day is it

Fresher than your man girl but whiter than a plate of grits

Hey, I gotta brand new phone rockin brand new clothes,
Leavin every single party with a brand new ho,
Yeah I've done a little travin circlin the globe
Always keep it movin inertia on these hos,
Boy ima asshole, girls call him a douchebag,
This some old school shit but no boombah,
This aint new swag... its the same ol me,
The youngin get respect from the games OGs,
The cameras flashin when we passin so we stay low key,
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be,
On a turnpike bitch and your tank on E,
With my head out the window screamin Get Like Me,
Ho, you should know the way I roll,
Take a couple shots and superman these hos,
Yoo, aint nothin with ya wack rap,
Used to be the class clown now I get the last laugh

If you in the ride turn the volume real high,
If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up

If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up
