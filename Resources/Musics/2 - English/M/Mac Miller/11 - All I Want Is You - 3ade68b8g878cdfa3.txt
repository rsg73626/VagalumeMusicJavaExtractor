ALL I WANT IS YOU

Girl I don't wanna share you
(Echo)
We could be together
But you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
(Echo)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow I hope you know
I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by
Baby all I'm gonna want is you

Girl I don't wanna share you
(Share You)
We could be together, but you scared to

(Leave You)

But I know as time goes by
Baby all I'm gonna want is you

Look
They told me never fall in love
It never works out in your favor
You way too young
And right now that's just human nature
You think you love her
But you don't
Think you gon be with her for the rest of your life
You prolly won't
But on my side
Shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like wi-fi
Mixed like tye-dye
She feelin cute wanna wear a lil lingerie
Voila

It ain't a sexual thing tho
We be stayin up
Smokin weed out her window
In love with me now
She never huntin me down
I'm tryna have it all
She ain't never comin around
It's like a never ending chase
Longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face
And I can't help but carry on
I know you love me don't lie (don't lie)
But you just gotta be mine cause...

I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave
She ain't comin back home
Hit the road forgettin about everybody she know
Miss
Hasn't called me in four days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey
She tryna be a lil player
Think she cute too
But I'ma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow
I know she worried
About all these girls approach me actin flirty
See that's the thang thing

I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life girl
All we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff
It's just you and I
We can travel round the world
Movin through the sky
Or we can stay right here
And you'll be mine
