PUT IT ON

All my peoples
All of my peoples
Everything is a okay (I'm so good)
Hey, we been waitin way too long
So tell the DJ he can play my song

All my peoples
All of my peoples
Everything is a okay (I'm so good baby)
Hey, we been waitin way too long
So tell the DJ he can play my song

Hey, I kinda feel like I deserve this
Butterflies all up in my stomach, like a first kiss
Just a word smith, using poetry and more but,
Distracted by these girls who want their juicy couture
Yeah, this life is all about material things
I got kids tricks, bitch I'm the cereal king
And everything better if you relax and and chill
So my seat back for weed naps, we need that, for real
I took my heart and put it all out on a CD
You now rockin' with the bees knees, 
I'm the cats pajamas, the coolest of the cool
The kid that got em' gas tappin usin' up they fuel
when they first heard em spit they didnt think it would be shit
M-O-S-T to the D-O-P-E kids
C U f'in H's now you hanging with a 
G bitch but they say you need Jesus

Ayo I'm half man half amazin
Flyer than a penguin, you dryer than a raisin
Hot like causan, bringing all the girls to the days in, 
ready for a little love makin
Yeah, I want it now but they tell me have some patience
Feelin' on top of the world is graduation
Now I do music all day cause there ain't no other option
Drivin' to Connecticut, then flyin' up to Boston
I put it on for my city, always showin' love
An overdose of drugs, how the people throwin' up?
They say waddup when I drop in
I'm just chillin back in my seat, Joe Swanson
Yeah I used to steal iPods and pawn them
Now I take my girl shoppin', no problem
Live it up every second, life don't got a sequel
It's all good, thumbs up to my people
