THOUGHTS FROM A BALCONY

For what's up about dream, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean

Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
Where the Cognac?
Let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told me story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony
Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories
So what the fuck is time?

They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories
So what the fuck is time?

What the, what the fuck is time?
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I know
What the fuck is time?
I asked 'em, what the fuck is time?

What do you do when you think you could be a icon
Cause all these people get to screamin when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, leave the coat
Racin to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers takin shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight tho, figured it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my sprite, then my nice slows, down, down
See that's exactly what I need
My khakis filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump", a fuckin hit but I just called it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin in the club
Hey, this some Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Why I don't think you lookin far beyond the surface
Learn quick now I'm big time, fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine

Filled up dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories
So what the fuck is time?

They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony

So what the fuck is time?

What the, what the fuck is time?
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I know
What the fuck is time?
I asked 'em, what the fuck is time?
Alright
