UP ALL NIGHT

[Intro] 
1, 2 
1, 2, 3 Go. 

Hey, hey, hey... 
Fill it up, fill it up! [x4] 

[1st Verse] 
Let me get another cup please 
I ain't driving home, so you can have my keys 
Got a bunch of tricks all hidden up my sleeve 
So I'mma get drunk, won't be leaving til 3 
I got a reputation of getting real wasted 
? Everything inside? 
So no I can't see, bitch 
Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip 
Life's so good: please enjoy it! 
End of every night when your head's in the toilet 
Yeah we party hard, give a f-ck about employment 
Kill the whole bottle we'll be spinning like a coin flip 
Yeah, we ain't going home no time soon 
I'm on shot #4 times 2 
Stand by the keg, let the host find you 

[Hook] 
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow 
We up all night [x4] 

Drink drink drink drink drink drink 
Til we can't no more [x2] 

[2nd Verse] 
Head starts swimming and my legs get wobbly 

Never listen to nobody who was trying to tell me "no" 

But these ladies go crazy at every single show 

Passing out, waking up with no shoes 

Like my liquor straight, I don't need no chaser 

[Hook] 
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow 
We up all night [x4] 

Drink drink drink drink drink drink 
Til we can't no more [x2] 

Hey, hey, hey... 
Fill it up, fill it up! [x4] 

[Hook] 
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow 
We up all night [x4] 

Drink drink drink drink drink drink 
Til we can't no more [x2]
