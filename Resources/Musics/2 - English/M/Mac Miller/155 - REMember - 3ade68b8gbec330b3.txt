REMEMBER

Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Verso 1)
Uh, I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going throught memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
I'll admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish i could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stop
For now I need to run to to any place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (talk you up)

(Refr達o)
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
We'd talk about the life we lived, and
West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

(Verso 2)
It's a dark science, when you're friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gon' by, bye then
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lenghts
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remeber shit you've forgot
Cus way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

(Refr達o)
