LIVE IT UP

Hey, don't control yourself
This your life you want it uh said you want it
So live it up
All that matters is this moment uh
So whose coming

Don't control yourself
This your life you want it uh said you want it
So live it up
All that matters is this moment uh
So whose coming
Don't control yourself

I swear to god its a dream come true
Everybody gonna wonder what we gon do
Drinkin the red cup pre roll 10 blunts
When I go to sleep I don't think imma get up
Stay in bed til the afternoon
Cause you know what us rappers do
Get high get drunk then find some butt girl
I don't wanna have to chase after you
Let's live it up live it up party like we aint got shit to do
I don't give a fuck give a fuck nothing but cuttin up with the crew
My parents out of town so we gon put it down
We takin shots who can go another round

Don't control yourself

So whose coming

Don't control yourself
This your life you want it uh said you want it

Tonight's gonna be great let's get our drank
I'm tryin to get waisted bitch
This gonna be something to remember
To bad we wont
Its gonna get hot in here dont bring a coat

She's sort of fine borderline but tonight she be my lady
My parents out of town so we gon put it down
We takin shots who can go another round
