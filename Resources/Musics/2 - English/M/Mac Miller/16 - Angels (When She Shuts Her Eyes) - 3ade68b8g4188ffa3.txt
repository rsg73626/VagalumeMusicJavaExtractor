ANGELS (WHEN SHE SHUTS HER EYES)

Uh, I fuck around with amnesia, towards the over side of my leader
One day I'm a get it all cleaned up, right now I'm a dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day, picture brings back all the pain
All that shit that's hard to say, had a vision, lost it's way
This planet different that we live in, yeah, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in Genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes

She can get me high, when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go,
Don't, don't be afraid, don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me
This feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, owe me that, this is real but don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grown poor to last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly, I, I, I, I

I wonder where will I meet her, the perfect girl that I dream of
For now don't need no huge tits, I'm a cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all
She don't need a car, if love demanded now we could roll
And we drive there, save everything that we not said
I'm telling you that you hard to trust
You say you're not, got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world I need to let 'em know

She can get me high, when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid, don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me
This feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, owe me that, this is real but don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grown poor to last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly, I, I, I, I
