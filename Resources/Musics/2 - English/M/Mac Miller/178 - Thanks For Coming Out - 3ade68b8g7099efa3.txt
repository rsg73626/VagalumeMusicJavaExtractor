THANKS FOR COMING OUT

Yo...
You have now reached, the back of the High Life
Ahaa
Thanks for comin? out
I?ve been your host, Mac Miller
It?s been great spendin? the evening with you
Let?s ride out, so one last time
Eastern Empire
DJ Chef
Let?s get it...

So lay back in your seat, with your feet up on your couch
Thanks for comin? out
It?s been good, it?s been great, see you later
Times runnin? out, and y?all know what I?m about
Thanks for comin? out
It?s been good, it?s been great, see you later

So it?s the end of the tape
The last page
Hoes back stage
Party like my last day
Matter fact bitch I ain?t even half way finished
Y?all fragile held up in your glass cage
The grass sleepy like that foreign dude runnin? the rat race
Ass face, all your music nothin? but bad taste
I murder beats you can ask mace, homie
My shit I drop stickier than trash day
I ain?t gotta change shit
I?m so dangerous
And my style like a smile
So contagious
Bitches givin? me they hearts
So consistent never smart
Cause they always beggin? me not to break it
And ima make it
I?m somethin? you don?t really see often
Gonna be the greatest and that ain?t just the weed talkin?
I tell these people give me a clue
Cause the boy be chasin? honeys like Whinny the Pooh

So lay back in your seat, with your feet up on your couch
Thanks for comin? out
It?s been good, it?s been great, see you later
Times runnin? out, and y?all know what I?m about
Thanks for comin? out
It?s been good, it?s been great, see you later

Rain drops fallin? on my brain
Stayin? on track like I?m followin? a train
And I?m grindin? like your teeth when you angry
Go ahead cry yourself to sleep you a baby
Just a bum gotta hand you some change
Too smart
Y?all can call me Andy Dufresne
Still gotta inbox full of texts
And hoes tell me that I make a great first impression
Never stick around so they never learn they lesson
Hit it then I?m Nick Cage
Gone in sixty seconds
But you already know that pimpin?
Fish outta water need to go back swimmin?
They trippin?
Every time I?m rollin? they dippin?
Cause my style DOPE
Call me Homer Simpson
In the sky like sayin that I?m fly
You a loser
Meg Griffin on Family Guy

So lay back in your seat, with your feet up on your couch
Thanks for comin? out
It?s been good, it?s been great, see you later
Times runnin? out, and y?all know what I?m about
Thanks for comin? out
It?s been good, it?s been great, see you later
