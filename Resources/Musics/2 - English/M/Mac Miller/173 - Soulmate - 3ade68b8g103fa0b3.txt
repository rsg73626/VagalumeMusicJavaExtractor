SOULMATE

Do you feel like you're alone, will?
You have a soulmate?
Somebody who challenges you
I'm talking about someone who opens up
Things for youÂ—touches your soul
You can't give back to them, you know
You'll never have that kind of relationship
In a world where you're always afraid
To take the first step because
All you see is every negative
Thing ten miles down the road
You can do anything you want
You are bound by nothing

Yeah, are you my soulmate, my angel?
What do you want with me?
Too high, slow pace, my eyes closed
Your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do?
Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies
You think you a god 'til you run out of time
Yeah, when you're gone
What will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon
Where goes my mind?

You were the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs
Sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? what's so wrong?
I'm right here

Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know I'm in pain?
I get you close, you misconstrue
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything
You're made of
We ain't (nothing)
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, when are you coming through
To free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? open up
Let me inside
When you take off all your clothes
I'm under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high

You were the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs
Sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? what's so wrong?
I'm right here
