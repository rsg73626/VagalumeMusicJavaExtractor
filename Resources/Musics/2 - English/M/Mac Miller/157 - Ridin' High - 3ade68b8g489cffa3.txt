RIDIN' HIGH

Ridin' with the windows down 
Rollin through the city
Got the weed goin round
With the most dope with me
Simply gettin high like its 1969
Imma be grindin till the deal a hundred sixty
New york, atlanta too 
Flyer then santa shoes
She bring her camera through
And I'm playin crash bandacoot
This beat a bitch got some cock to server
I'm a rape the game, no wrap this burger
Hey! above the clouds, seein stars like L.A
Have your girl always comin back like airway
Imma' be rich that's what they tell me
So let me start workin' with this paper like a essay
Hey, athleticism workin game when I'm gettin' women
The freshest linen like I'm spittin through your television
In a day dream livin' while these minutes pass me by
Lean back and hang ya nikes out the ride
The windows down, turn the system up

We just tryna ride around cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey! lets just hit the road
[X2]
Rockin khakicalo jeans and the plain white tee
Nike watch pouch chain, spend a day like me
Hey, everyday like a movie scene
Smokin weed, eyes glued to the computer screen
Uh, super duper skeet ridin in the civic
Just got some speakers now I'm tryna get it tinted
Every dream vivid, talk it how I live it
Up in the airplane playin quidditch, bitches
This is once of a lifetime they gonna put me in a flight no price line
Used to want to be a model fightin crime
Till i realized the boy had the nicest rhymes

We just tryna ride around cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey! lets just hit the road
