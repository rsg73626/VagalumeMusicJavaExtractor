THE WAY

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off of flowers like
Do she love me? Do she love me not?
I ain't a player, I just

You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away

If you want, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel
When you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

It's so crazy, you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey, it ain't a question, quick question
'Cause boy I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover and friend, you'll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel
When you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly
When I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public
But a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feeling lonely
So you sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me
"American Beauty" or "Bruce Almighty" that's groovy
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you
I'm not gonna get bored of
But baby you an adventure so let me come and explore you

So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel
When you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

The way I love you
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it
The way I love you
