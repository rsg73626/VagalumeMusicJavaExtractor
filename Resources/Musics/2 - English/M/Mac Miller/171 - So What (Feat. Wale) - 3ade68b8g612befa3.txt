SO WHAT (FEAT. WALE)

[Wale]
This is the fun part, no what I'm saying?

Seen the highs and lows
Seen the highs and lows, remember when I was broke
Trying to shower with soap, roaches all in the soap
Now I'm killing these shows, I just deliver the hope
These women give you their heart, these bitches give me they throat
These bitches give me their mind all the time let a way to break it down
Never tell em bend over I just make em' take a bow
Stepping out fly shit, straight purple cloud shit
Roll the whole mountain, now I'm on the couch bent
Okay DMV shit but they know me out in P.A.
Scooping out hoes at the O's out in P.A.
Haha, okay my flow is on that freebase
Louboutin sneakers I suppose I can relay
Mac Miller my little nigga, real nigga
P.A. skillin we on a roll like thick strippers
You still sleepin, you can't see em, we still beefin
We still rolling, we still blowing, we still achieving
I'm still killing, still winning, we still Sheen'ing
I'm Ricky Vaughn on the song, why you still swinging?
Why you lil niggas still swinging? 
Got virgin tight flows still bleeding

[Mac Miller]
Maybe good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, I'm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck

[Wale]
My nigga good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, I'm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck, I ain't giving a fuck

[Mac Miller]
I ain't give a fuck, I hear em talking I don't listen I'm up
In the clouds looking down, I ain't even in a rush
I been laughed at, hated on, no one would even play my songs
Wouldn't even listen to anything that my name was on
It's so hard and it's so an this marvelous flow
Cause as hard as I go I know that I can't stop won't stop
I love what I do, you don't even know yourself how we fucking with you?
I ain't got time for all the problems, no I never did my trig
Smile on my face got me feeling like the shit
Bill Clinton pimping, always with a Monica
Days in turn that shit to hotel erotica
Marijuana for everybody in Yamakas
I don't give a fuck till my homies put some bottles up
And talking shit we gon' party all day, when I'm in the DMV I hit the home Wale
Hit strip clubs find bitches with big butts
I don't give a fuck I'm getting drunk, only live once
Young and dumb as hell, something something something something something, fuck it

[Wale]
My nigga good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, I'm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck, I ain't giving a fuck

[Mac Miller]
Maybe good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, I'm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck
