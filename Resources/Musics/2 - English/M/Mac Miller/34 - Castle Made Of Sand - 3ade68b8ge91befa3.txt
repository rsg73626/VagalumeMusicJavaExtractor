CASTLE MADE OF SAND

Yeah...
Let me crack open my high life
Product placement

Lets take it to the top now
To the top now baby
I'mma take my time
Through rain sleet snow
I'mma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put ur motherfuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down please stand
Cuz I'm on the rise and I reside
In this castle made of sand

Let me getta hand clap
I'mma make an entrance
Givin' y'all the lecture
Then I'm taking questions
My soul is sour making sentence make a weapon
Swimmin' in the deep end
You bitches takin' lessons
Then I hear u hatin' on the boy
Well I aint affended
Cuz I'm the captain of the team and u play the benches
Still breaking it down to rollin' it up
Put an a d in the blunt
And I'm smokin' a dutch
But takos but I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me what a player to do
When being real do appeal to the player in you
I've seen some whack cats fast track to the fame
To me it sounds like some clowns rapin' the same
And we, we all living for the same thing
Just to take it to the top
And remain king

Lets take it to the top now
To the top now baby
I'mma take my time
Through rain sleet snow
I'mma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put ur motherfuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down please stand
Cuz I'm on the rise and I reside
In this castle made of sand

You can't name a single youngin'
With a flow like mine
Got bars like soap
And I glow like shine
If you think I'm whack you might change your mind
Cuz I got them punchlines that stain like whine
Let me take my time
Collect my thoughts
Keep it fresh like shoes when they kept in the box
Connect all the dots
I'm fresh so clean
Stay pinchin' my self
Cuz I'm living in a dream
Believe I ain't ever gonna stop
Find a new spot to set up my shop
When I drop, your wifey gonna cop dat
Haters gettin' shaken out they jockstraps
Some say I'm bring hip-hop back
While others say that I'm all up on that pop-rap
Team captain control the game
Goin' hard till every single person knows my name

Lets take it to the top now
To the top now baby
I'mma take my time
Through rain sleet snow
I'mma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put ur motherfuckin' hands in the sky (hands in the sky)
And if you sittin' down please stand (down please stand)
Cuz I'm on the rise and I reside
In this castle made of sand

To the top now to the top now baby
Yeah
