YOUFORIA

I've been waiting so long
To get into her view by my side (to tell you I love you)
I can't do no wrong when you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria

Youphoria!

And when you look in my eyes the pain goes away
(Youphoria)
You feel so damn good (I want you to know that)
Just come take my hand closer
We could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we're here (living)
(you're my) euphoria

Youphoria!

Oh, oh oh oh, oh

Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes away
Youphoria!

Youphoria!

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

Youphoria!

oh oh oh oh, oh oh

Youphoria!

And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can stay (youphoria)

Youphoria!
