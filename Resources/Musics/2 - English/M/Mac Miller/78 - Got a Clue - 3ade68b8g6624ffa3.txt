GOT A CLUE

Oh, glance at her when she walking by,
The type that never stop to talk to guys

She alone and you not surprised cuz
She ain't fit for no other man
So you approach as a gentleman

Hello man today you lookin pretty damn elegann'
I think she get the message like a telegram
I'm a be your cab and your yellow van

Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go
To the top, she perfect and she outta know
When she walkin by the studio, 
you can see my heart beating through my clothes

She ain't around time moving slow, 
I wanna be where ever you gon go
And I wander if she know my name
She shine like she ain't know what rain is
The game is the same as a was is the lame kids
You wanted to hang with her every single day, is funny
Cuz your friends say your whipped
Every late night you gotta go an dip, 
to pick her up, and I be sick of sluts
And this girl she ain't gon give it up
She want me puttin work like school
And I be spittin when she hear like a fool, but keep my cool
Gotta be smooth
Eyes like elmer, got me glued
These other dudes is a not for you, 
I think cupid musta shot you too

[x2]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you gotta clue
When you around it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you

I see at the dry clean, locked eyes
It was raining, she looking like sunshine
I told her we could have a fun time
Lemme just take you out to lunch I'm a really nice guy
I ain't gonna hurt you
I ain't even bout to flirt too
Cus I'm a be straight up with you

And don't bring no make up witchu
I just wanna chill, kick it at the crib
Everytime we kiss, it tickle on my lips
I love the way you looking at me, 
I just wanna see you looking happy
You grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me
And go let me get it at the movies
Why you sitting over a few seats
Come and move closer to me
I hope you know that you got me, heres my number,
Girl you can call me
And if you guessing don't stress, cuz I ain't havin no mess

She the only thing on my mind
I think about her all the time
And it's all cuz I'm on my grind
But I think I'm a call her mine

[x2]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you gotta clue
When you around it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you
