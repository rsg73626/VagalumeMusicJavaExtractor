GET UP

It's about to be a big shit poppin' by the time this shit is droppin'
Stoppin' not an option
I'm addicted this a problem
This way of a life, sex, drugs, rock and roll on the road
Feeling blessed performing for sold out shows
Who ever's talkin shit what chu know bout those
What chu know bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes
It's unbelievable these people sai I made it throwin' down a lil henny
Can't believe that I don't chase it
Life goes on, days get brighter
I'm feelin' like I came in with my haze no lighter
So I'm lookin' for the missing piece
Goin down in history for rippin' beats
Smooth game sweeter than a Krispie Kreme
You tune into my station hope you listenin'
Turn it up and follow all my journeys as I live my dream
All natural whole foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is a happy like a show tune
This a brand new world I can show you
Some people still have no clue
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce

In the world that go round you up and you down
You in and you out
You smile and you frown
Just get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

In the world that go round you up and you down
You in and you out
You smile and you frown
Just get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Hey 
Ayo I'm fast lane switchin'
Rap game spittin'
Chillin' with some sour
Got a bad dame twistin'
These people think I'm goofy say Mac's day trippin'
Cause life a comedy like my last name griffin (what)
Livin for the moment
Blowin' potent overloaded
And my swagger call me old spice
Yeah the kid is so nice
Smokin' in the wind chillin'
Duckin' from the police (police)
So bright you know light
So I'm shinin' like a strobe lights
Leave the show with money and I always count my dough twice
Most dope general and that shit is fo life
My mama taught me well so I even treat these hoes right I'm polite
Workin' in my office but no dwight
Coat white skinded no light dimness
Me who I am playing sight for these bitches
And I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches
And I don't got time to spend the night with these bitches

In the world that go round you up and you down
You in and you out
You smile and you frown
Just get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

In the world that go round you up and you down
You in and you out
You smile and you frown
Just get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up
