GOOSEBUMPZ (BONUS TRACK)

[Verse 1]
Better act right cause I smack dykes
give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe
Bitch wanna live that rap life
but I already hit that last night
Think you're fucking with me, huh?
Must be hitting that crack-pipe
I be making my money
thank God I learned how to add right
My cash like that cocaine, give me more
say give me more
Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing
big titty hoes in my videos
Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell, smack her ass
and then wish her well
Life sucks, better give 'em hell, get money
fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million in my briefcase
'bout to shop for some real estate
'bout to party with drugs though, turn it up
bitch feel the bass
Throwing money, in your face, feeling good, living great
Bad bitches in different states
it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase
With pornstars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard?
How we get all this money though?
You know how big his tours are?
Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch
want some money, but need some dick
And my belt monogram
when I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram though

[Hook]
We in my black Benz, windows up
getting head, smoking blunts
Everybody know what's up and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck

[Verse 2]
Don't I look like a drug dealer?
Don't I look like I'm somebody
Killing beats with that Murder Inc
don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti
Riding through with my hippy van
you broke bitches don't give a damn
You softer than the Michelin man
your bitch put her pussy on Instagram
Better go hard when my flow start
they brand new with they old cars
Your pockets is on low carbs
she do a show, she a pollstar
In the penthouse, with the pants down
with the camera out, no hands now
Them hard drugs, we don't ran out
Can't believe that's someone's grand child
She's so bad but I like it, wanna hear your pussy I'll mic it
My credit card bill is righteous
but girl that ass is so priceless
Spend the night with the right bitch
my dick ill, my pipe sick
Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit
Fuck free, no charge, I play with that pussy like Mozart
Eat that pussy, I won't starve
love the pussy with my whole heart
Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho
Give me head put the Benz in captain mode
And my belt monogram
when I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram

[Hook]
