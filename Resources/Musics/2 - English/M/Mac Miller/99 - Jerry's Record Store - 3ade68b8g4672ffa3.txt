JERRY'S RECORD STORE

In your old man voice 
Yeah, a one two, a one two 
For one two, for one two 
For one two, for one two 
For one two, for one two 
Uh uh nothin' but rhymes its quite simple 
Hey its what I create to eliminate the hate 
Illuminate the night in the lightning 
Ufo sightings leave em unidentified 
Steady I be getting high 
You ain't got no herbal I'ma lend you mine 
Its doctor octagon call him young phenomenon 
I leave these rappers starving like its ramadan 
You are the wackest my style holographic 
Had to put my city on the map shit 
If you a fat kid go get active 
If you a bad b!tch then be a actress 
Rap ease carnage, my family ate the portage 
Wh0re tricks flawless like trapeze artists 
Take my life and put it in a photo album 
How much money do I got? I don't know who's countin' 
Fake mouthaf-cka's round me I could do without them 
You keepin' it a hundred I could use a thousand 
I'm comin' now, call a truce 
I got a lot but, not to lose 
I'm the shit makin' hits call me doctor luke 
And prescribing you a vibe for that awful mood 
Why you sad all the time? 
Jump off a roof 
While I'm kicking it with q-tip and ? 
Tryna put me down well that's few tell woo shell 
Supernatural message got you spooked out 
Believe in god but don't believe religion 
Saying its the truth but never really listened 
That's another conversation though 
Walking on the pavement home find a way to go 
Maybe one might take the word robert frost 
Blowin' out steam but its all exhaust 
We comin' for your dollars better call the cops 
You want a war? we got a nuclear holocaust 
Yo e how many bars is that 
Is it enough to give these haters all heart attacks 
I been writing on the paper 
Gave me carpal tunnel 
Couple billion people are they all gon' love you? 
Hell no hell no 
I be grindin' though rain sleet hail snow 
Sticking to my word like its velcro 
On some shell toes 
What else yo 
Dope shit, go crazy 
Kinda like the internet over hov's baby 
My girl tell me mac you a wierdo 
I guarantee that baby be a super hero 
This ain't nothin' but comes rhymes from my mind 
That been stuck inside since the 
Beginning of time 
Chemical romance, slow dance with no pants 
If I got my eyes on her playa you got no chance 
This some simple shit I'm sure they fear 
I'm just trying to explore whats real 
Child of the blues never liked school 
Been miseducated so word to laura hill 
Music is my outlet walking through the polo store 
In the studio wondering what I go home for 
In my own world when I close the door 
To the booth, young and searching for the truth 
Like that
