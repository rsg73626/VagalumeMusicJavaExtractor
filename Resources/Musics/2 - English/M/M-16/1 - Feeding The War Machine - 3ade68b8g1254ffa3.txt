FEEDING THE WAR MACHINE

Fear/desire
You are what you own
A road leading nowhere
A future to disown

Hope/failure
Opposites in league
The stage is set
The ends will always justify the means

Fascist cult
Extreme view
New World plan
Break the law
Power grab
Invade lands

Onward through darkness and doubt
Blind eyes shield our hearts from it all

Pride/deceit
Exploiting those in need
Born to die, off to fight
Kill to set them free

The lies are sold
Erase everything you know
War is peace, greed is good
And we are never wrong

Fascist cult
Extreme view
New World plan
Break the law
Power grab
Invade lands

Onward through darkness and doubt
Blind eyes shield our hearts from it all
Hearts and minds were never won
Staring down the barrel of a gun
