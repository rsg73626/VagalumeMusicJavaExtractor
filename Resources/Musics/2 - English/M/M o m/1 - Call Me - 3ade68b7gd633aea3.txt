CALL ME

Let me stay with you today
And tell to me all words you say
Come to me ever by my side
Remember this all time

Please don’t go by another way
Couse i’’l be lost if you don’t stay
Try to love me all this night
Remember this all time

If i close my heart you wuill not read my feelings
Beleve in me, in my love
And run together, shout my name for all this time

So you call me before it’s to late
If you need me every breath
And belive me my love is great
Try to stop this moment of my dreams
