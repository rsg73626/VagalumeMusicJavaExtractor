SO SICK

Gotta runaway from this misery that we're going through
Cuz i didnt expect for this to happen to me or you.
And i know parents will say education is good for you
But i cant put up with this shit anymore
Its ridiculous
Its bin months since i attended this school
Its not marvelous
Dont know why i'm goin through this
Enough is enough
No more walking round, bored as hell
I'm so tired of this shit i'm leaving Manor School

Cuz i'm so sick of manor, i hate Ms.Gadd
So sick of Garcia, she makes me mad
And i'm so sick of Mackoy, he plays with boys
So why am i still in this stupid school

Leave Me Alone
Stupid Manor
Dont make me think aboutold friends
Or goin to those jams
I'm letting go
Aint thinking bout Manor no more

Cuz i'm so sick of manor, i hate Ms.Gadd
So sick of Garcia, she makes me mad
And i'm so sick of Mackoy, he plays with boys
So why am i still in this stupid school
