I'VE FOUND MY FREEDON

I'm going down by the riverside
gonna wash away my troubles in the noon day tide.
The tax man's coming and he wants his dues
but the only way to catch me is to wet his shoes.

I've found my freedom
a paradise meant for me
I've found my freedom
da-da-da-da
de-de-de.
I've found my freedom
a paradise meant for me
I've found my freedom
da-da-da-da
de-de-de.

Hold my head up and look to the sun
i've found me a place where I don't have to run
no-one to find me in my restricted zone
'cause I've left my address as a place unknown.

I've found my freedom...

Remember all you people if you're tired and down
you've got to leave the city or you're sure to drown
make a bid for freedom and you're sure to find
you've found yourself the good life and your peace of mind.

I've found my freedom...
