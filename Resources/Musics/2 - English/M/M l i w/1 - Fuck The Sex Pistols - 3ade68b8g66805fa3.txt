FUCK THE SEX PISTOLS

The grass was never green.
There was never purity.

Some say it's all over... stupid fucking jaded burnouts.
Young ones: carry on. destroy and annoy.

Hey! hey! hey! hey!
Fuck the glory days!

We don't care what you think.
We don't care what you say.
You don't get to decide
It's ours. go away. shut up.
