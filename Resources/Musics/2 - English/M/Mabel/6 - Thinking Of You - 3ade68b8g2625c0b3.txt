THINKING OF YOU

I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
Thinking of you

What can I tell if you're into me?
I'm your nine to five
Been away for a couple of weeks
Could be more 'cause I lost track of time
Driving on the wrong side thinking of you
On the tenth floor, thinking of you
And it isn't like me to be insecure
Oh, what have you done to my mind?
Oh, oh, wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Oh, my god, I'm a mess
Boy, you got to me, got to me
You know you got to me

Try to forget about you, with no chance
I wasn't looking for romance
Blue skies, but I'm at the door
Waiting for someone to come pick me up
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

In the hills with the windows down
Telling me he wants to show me around
He knows somebody with the fancy house
On the playlist, seems to be famous
Heating me to the beach
Yeah I was thinking of you
Standing in his room
But I was thinking of you
And I don't want you to be insecure
Don't wanna play with your mind
Oh, oh, wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Oh, my god, I'm a mess
Boy, you got to me, got to me
You know you got to me

Try to forget about you, with no chance
I wasn't looking for romance
Blue skies, but I'm at the door
Waiting for someone to come pick me up
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

Uh, I'm coming right back
Tell all your friends that I'm coming right back
Uh, I'm coming right back
You're enough to make me wanna back track

Uh, I'm coming right back
Tell all your friends that I'm coming right back
Uh, I'm coming right back
You're enough to make me wanna back track

Try to forget about you, with no chance
I wasn't looking for romance
Blue skies, but I'm at the door
Waiting for someone to come pick me up
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
Uuh uuh, oh, oh, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
