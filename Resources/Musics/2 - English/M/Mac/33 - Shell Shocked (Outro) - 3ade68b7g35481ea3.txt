SHELL SHOCKED (OUTRO)

hey baby why dont you take me for the night
ill keep you warm and keep you close...no one knows that your here with me or 
that we even tight
your my lil secret and thats how we should keep it
ill never let ya go..never let em know...if you know like i know
we will never let go
you my lil boo that i be with everyday
all year round from june to may and baby theres something i gotta say
i love you girl and thats something that is different
i usually play girls...be a thug and shit
go from girl to girl getting play from ya'lls

then i got shell shocked when i looked in your eyes
never ever knew that a girl didnt lie
i always thought they was hoes 
sleeping around going from door to door
saying the wanna fuck so thats what i do
until the day it came to you
you made me changed you made me different
i never told anybody this but girl..i think im in love with you

so now that you know this i think we gotta make a plan
something that will help us stand..out in this world forever
have those 2 or 3 kids that youve always dreamed of girl
get a big ass mansion where we cant fill all the rooms
where theres you and me...in love forever 
something that wont ever change o never
i never thought id find a true love like this
i nver imagened that a a girl would come along so perfect to kiss

then i got shell shocked when i looked in your eyes
never ever knew that a girl didnt lie
i always thought they was houes
sleeping around going from door to door
saying they wanna fuck so thats what i do
until the day it came to you
you made me changed you made me different
i never told anybody this but girl..i think im in love with you

from the first time i met you 
you was on my mind all night
a maybelline queen with a bodyall tight
wearing black and white your attitude right
you the type a women that i need in my life
to add a little spice 
keep a nigga strong and right
well baby i need you right now
in my arms carressing me i can see your eyes undressing me
girl its destiny 
just the sound of your voice makes my heart melt away
cuz girl its all bout you

then i got shell shocked when i looked in your eyes
never ever knew that a girl didnt lie
i always thought they was houes
sleeping around going from door to door
saying they wanna fuck so thats what i do
until the day it came to you
you made me changed you made me different
i never told anybody this but girl..i think im in love with you
