HOW DO I GET TO YOU

When you're right, you're right, and I know it cause I've seen it all my life
That you're right that you just can't charm a lady with a knife
But that sucks, cause it's all I know how to do
Girl, please tell me, how do I get to you?

All I know that you don't think that I could ever be the boy for you
But I do and I want to make you feel the same way too
So come on, don't you know my love is true?
Girl, please tell me, how do I get to you?
Please tell me how, how do I get to you?
Please tell me how, how do I get to you?

Well it's hard to embark on a quest for love when you're locked up in jail
Send you mail, but get every letter back return to sender
What the fuck? Don't you know my love is true?
Oh girl, please tell me, how do I get to you?

Please tell me how, how do I get to you?
Please tell me how, how do I get to you?
Please tell me how, how do I get to you?
Please tell me how, please tell me how, how do I get to you?
