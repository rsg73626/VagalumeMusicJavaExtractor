STICK 'EM UP

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up
I got a knife, motherfucker, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up
I got a knife, motherfucker, stick 'em up

I got a knife, it's a switchblade
I think it's time for me to get paid
Gimme your money, don't hesitate
Or you'll regret it
Here in the alley, it's just you and me
And the homeless dude, but he's asleep
Gimme your fuckin' money, I repeat

I got a knife, I got a knife, I got a knife
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up
I got a knife, motherfucker, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up
I got a knife, motherfucker, stick 'em up

I got your money now I gotta flee
Don't try to send nobody after me
I got your address off your id
And don't forget it
I'll take your money on a shopping spree
First the liquor store, then qvc
It's like a merry christmas, just for me

I got a knife, I got a knife, I got a knife
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up
I got a knife, motherfucker, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up
I got a knife, motherfucker, stick 'em up
