BAD LUCK BLUES

Hey people, listen while I spread my news
Hey people, listen while I spread my news
I wanna tell you people all about my bad luck blues
Did you ever wake up just at the break of day
Did you ever break up just at the wake of day
With your arms around the pillow where your daddy used to lay
Lord, look where the chump's
done gone
Lord, Lord, look where the time's done gone
Hey Lord, there's something going all wrong
What's the use of living if you can't get the man you love
The use of living if you can't get the man you love
You might as well go die, give your soul to the Maker above
