SISSY BLUES

I dreamed last night I was far from harm
Woke up and found my man in a sissy's
arms
"Hello, Central, it's 'bout to run me wild
Can I get that number, or will I have to wait a while?"
Some are young, some are old
My man says sissy's got good jelly roll
My man got a sissy, his name is Miss Kate
He shook that thing like jelly on a plate
Now all the people ask me why I'm all alone
A sissy shook that thing and took my man from me
