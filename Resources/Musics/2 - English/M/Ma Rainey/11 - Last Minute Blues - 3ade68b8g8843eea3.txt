LAST MINUTE BLUES

Minutes seem like hours, hours seem like days
Minutes seem like hours, hours seem like days
It seems like my daddy won't stop his evil ways
Seems like every minute's going to be my last
Seems like every minute's going to be my last
If I can't tell my future I won't tell my past
The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my daddy, somebody ought to bury me
If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song
If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song
Tell 'em you don't know the writer, but Ma Rainey put it on
