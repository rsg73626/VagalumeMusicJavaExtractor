CHAIN GANG

The judge found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down
The judge found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down
Just a poor gal in trouble, I know I'm county road bound
Many days of sorrow, many nights of woe
Many days of sorrow, many nights of woe
And a ball and chain everywhere I go
Chains on my feet, padlock on my hand
Chains on my feet, padlock on my hand
It's all on account of stealing a woman's man
It was early this morning that I had my trial
It was early this morning that I had my trial
Ninety days on the county road, and judge didn't even smile
