DON'T FISH IN MY SEA

My daddy come home this mornin', drunk as he could be
My daddy come home this mornin', drunk as he could be
I know that he's done got bad on me
He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all
He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all
I know there's another mule
been kicking in my stable
If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea
If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea
Stay out of my valley, let my mountain be
I ain't had no loving since God knows when
I ain't had no loving since God knows when
That's the reason I'm through with these no-good, trifling
men
You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall
You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall
You'll never miss your ham till another mule be in your stall
