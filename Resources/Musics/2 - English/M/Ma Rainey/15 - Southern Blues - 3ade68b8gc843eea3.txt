SOUTHERN BLUES

House catch on fire and ain't no water 'round
If your house catch on fire, ain't no water 'round
Throw your trunk out the window, building, burn on down
I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told
I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told
He said, "Doggone you girlie, doggone your bad luck soul"
I turned around, went to that gypsy next door
I turned around, went to that gypsy next door
He said, "You'll get a man anywhere you'll go"
Let me be your rag doll until your Chinee comes
Let me be your rag doll till your Chinee comes
If she beats me ragging, she's got to rag it some
