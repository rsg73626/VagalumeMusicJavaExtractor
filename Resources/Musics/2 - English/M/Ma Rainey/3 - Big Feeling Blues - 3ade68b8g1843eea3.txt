BIG FEELING BLUES

Ma:
"All these many years I've been pleadin' for a man
How come I can't get me a real
monkey man
I'm not no triflin'
woman
I've been lookin' for a man I can call my own
Been married many times but they left my home
Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I ever had
I've got the big feelin' blues I mean I've got them bad"
Charlie
"If you're lookin' for a brown, come get this chocolate cream
I'm a big kid-man - just out of my teens"
Ma:
"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I ever had
I've got them big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"
"Unlucky with my
yellow, unlucky with my brown,
the black bitches keep on throwin' me down'
"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had
I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"
Charlie:
"If you need a good man why don't you try me?
I sure can put you out of your misery"
Ma:
"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had
I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad
There's a whole lot left, what's left is good
Give me a chance, honey, I'll make you change your neighbourhood
Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had,
I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"
