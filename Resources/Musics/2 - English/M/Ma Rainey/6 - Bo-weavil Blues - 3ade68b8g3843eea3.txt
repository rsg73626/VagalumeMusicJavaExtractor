BO-WEAVIL BLUES

Hey, bo-weavil, don't sing them blues no more
Hey, hey, bo-weavil, don't sing them blues no more
Bo-weavil's here, bo-weavil's everywhere you'll go
I'm a lone bo-weavil, been out a great long time
I'm a lone bo-weavil, been out a great long time
I'm gonna sing these blues to ease the bo-weavil's lonesome mind
I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea
I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea
Some of them's so evil, I'm afraid they might poison me
I went downtown and bought me a hat
I brought it back home, I laid it on the shelf
Looked at my bed, I'm getting tired of sleeping by myself
