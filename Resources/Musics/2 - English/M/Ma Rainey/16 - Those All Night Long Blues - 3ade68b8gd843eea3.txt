THOSE ALL NIGHT LONG BLUES

I have sent a letter away 'cause my man and I don't agree
There's no reason why he should treat me this way
'Cause the way I worry, I will soon be old and grey
Don't want to do nothing that's wrong
But can't stand this treatment long
I just lay and suffer, crying, sighing all night long
'Cause the way that I'm worried, Lordy it sure is wrong
All night long, all night long
It's this one man on my mind
Can't sleep a wink at night from crying
All night long, got my worries just renewed
And I suffer with those all night blues
