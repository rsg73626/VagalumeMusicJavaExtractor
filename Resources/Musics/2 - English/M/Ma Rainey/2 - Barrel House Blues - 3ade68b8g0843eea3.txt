BARREL HOUSE BLUES

Got the
barrel house
blues, feeling awfully dry
Got the barrel house blues, feeling awfully dry
I can't drink
moonshine
'cause I'm afraid I'd die
Papa likes his sherry, mama likes her port
Papa likes his sherry, mama likes her port
Papa likes to shimmy, mama likes to sport
Papa likes his bourbon, mama likes her gin
Papa likes his bourbon, mama likes her gin
Papa likes his outside women, mama likes outside men
