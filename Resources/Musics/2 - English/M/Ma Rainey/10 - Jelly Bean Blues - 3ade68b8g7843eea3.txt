JELLY BEAN BLUES

If you ever wake up with your good man on your mind
If you ever wake up with your good man on your mind
My daddy left me this morning, that's why I moan and cry
He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, he'll drive those blues away
You'll sit right down and weep and moan and then you'll find he's went
Lord, I been wonderin' where my jelly bean
has gone
I can see you rider, yea, helle loo, a thousand miles away
I just can't remember what my baby had to say
He said:
see see rider, today I'm goin' away, and I won't be back until you change your way
So back and easy rider, today that mean' goodbye
You did not worry me, you had no right to lie
