Verse 1 *(Mac Mall)* 

I'm a cut throat nigga 
I told her gone off that Nitro 
go mani on yo block makin ??? sleep wit the lights on 
Mr. Vicious down to do wrong 
wit a pack of savage niggas that'll come an get ya outta ya jones 
damn them squares ain't safe 
got him for the briefcase 
a big face 
and I was bare faced 
I know ya hate the taste of my name in yo mouth 
you know what I'm bout 
quick to test yo d-boy clout an leave ya laid out 
busta I never liked ya keep a thousand yards stiff 
when I'm mashin by, ya pussy posse ain't gon' appear 
like if I hopped out, told ya to run yo shit playa 
we both know that the moss will leave yo ass dead 
I run the hood like a jungle 
king of the beast 
head hunters after me, I make 'em all bleed 
fuck the rollas man, they betta not run up on my plot 
cuz I won't dump until I drop my semi on cops 
blowin my top 
lettin loose like a nut 
should all the stoppers bag me up that's how ya bring the funk 
so when ya see me comin, folks ya betta watch ya shit 
I start to mobbin in this BITCH! MUTHA FUCKA! 


Chorus *(Mac Mall)* 

You know I want it nigga 
I know you got it nigga 
when you see me pull out my heat, juss come up out it nigga. 
You know I want it nigga

when you see me pull out my heat, juss come up out it nigga. 
Don't flinch. 
Don't Move. 
Don't break. 
My bottle will make ya body shake sucka.

Don't Move. 
Don't break. 
Or today is gon' be your last day.

Verse 2 *(JT Tha Bigga Figga)* 

As I rumble through the clothes in yo dresser 
hopin I catch ya

an his pistol 
an his sacks 
stuff my pockets 
out the back 
an I'm off to the track 
4-5 an a vest an I'm all in black 
an i got me a gat 
cuz you know an I know that war field 
that broke niggas provoke niggas 
an dumb niggas gon' go there 
but oh well 
it's all official, comin to get ya 
niggas wit dope sells 
an if you wonder we gon' split ya 
niggas wit mo mail 
this Cali livin' ain't no jokin 
paper chasin on my hustle to the day I go broke 
satisfied wit my riches 
never that I keep it goin wit my 
cut him all in the back of a bucket we blowin 
test the nuts of these ridas 
man it's on, on sight 
got my pistol in my pocket an I'm ready to strike 
we foldin 'em up like blankets 
tuck 'em away like Ben Franklin's 
on a day-to-day basis, different places an leave 'em stankin. 
Don't Move nigga.
