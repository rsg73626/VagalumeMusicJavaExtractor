Hot shit.

Confident One 
(Representin!) 
(Wha what?) 
(Spit this shit for me than man) 
(This Mac Mall in here) 
(You feel me playa?) 
(Check this out) 
(I'm gon' let these niggas know what's really goin' on though) 

Chorus 2x *(Confident One)* 

Do people ever ask you why you smoke so much weed? 
Why yo pants saggin' while you sippin' Hennessy? 
Smashin a V-12 doin' one-sixty 
tryin to get this money so we in this bitch deep. 

Verse 1 *(Confident One)* 

Here's the reason why TC-1 don't give a fuck 
cuz niggas won't lend you a dime when you down on yo luck 
plus they buck 
when you up these hoolagan niggas 'll leave you stuck 
an if you as cold as starvin' 
nobody put a nickle in your cup 
reprehensible attitudes is what we dealin' wit 
an in this Millennieum we die 
from one stroke of our dick 
what a world 
when you ain't got nothin' they say "He ain't bout shit." 
An when you ball to often these niggas they want you to quit 
(stop, stop!) 
We up against all odds as we sippin' Hennessy 
avoidin' shady niggas 
quick to blast at racist police 
an to you money hungry bitches 
I won't even waste my time 
I give a fuck how fine 
I won't spend a fuckin' dime 
I'm tired of you niggas an yo repitious talk 
how you's a killa that stalks 
a pimp wit that walk 
let me shake my ashes as this THC ignites 
Khayree turn the beat up an pass the weed to fix your sight 
beware of them niggas who won't look you in yo eye 
smilin' all the time 
but in they heart is dispise 
check the blueprints 
study the (sclumatics??) 
learn the lesson 
an as you roll four deep in your whip my niggas here's the question. 

*(Chorus)* 

Verse 2 *(Mac Mall)* 

I wrote this fo' them inquiring minds 
who need to worry bout they own an stay the fuck outta mine 
punk niggas always whinin' an lyin' 
all on my mutha fuckin nuts 
juss like them chickens in the beauty salon, choppin me up 
suckas get so emotional 
when you ridin they hoe 
or when you ballin an they out there broke 
but I'd a seen niggas wit loot hatin on me too 
cuz I done 
treated they boo juss like a prostitute 
let her slide on my dick 
an she gave me ya whole script 
how much mail you workin wit 
an where ya hide them kicks 
but I ain't trippin off you trick, I'd rather spark me a spliff 
the white widow wit the Afghan-hashish mix 
bitches get so passionate 
when a nigga fuck the pussy 
steal the heart 
an take the chips an then dip 
an when you tell all your friends they like, "No he didn't!" 
an in yo face they might tell ya that Mac Mall ain't shit 
but that was one big mistake that was made by this chick 
see she told 'em how I fucked now her cousins my new bitch 
real mackin' hear me 
go on an crack the Henny 
go on an spark the Philly 
we goin' straight to the land 
now if I dropped ya on the track 
hit the block in a Lac 
when I see you later 
you besta have me a grand 
call me more than a playa 
fool I'm more like the coach 
runnin plays on the bench 
"Go deep young hoe!!" 

*(Chorus)* 

Verse 3 *(Mac Mall)* 

I show the world no mercy 
shall let no nigga serve me 
shall let no bitch disturb me 
she juss ain't worthy 
born in the game, forced to get my hands dirty 
an life is like a house party an I'm strapped 
plus perkin' 
always off the Roper 
you always see me loaded 
I always stay paid punk an all you marks can quote it 
I spit that true game 
an you been fiendin fo' it 
like every line is heir-on coated 
hip-hop an you own it! 

*(Chorus)* 

*(Mac Mall)* 

Deep, deep, deep! 
Fa sho. 
Let 'em know about it. 
Let 'em know about it, Mac Mall in this bitch nigga.
