WIDE OPEN (FEAT.SHIMA)

[Verse 1:]
When I first glanced at ya I knew I had to have ya
Fly chassis with a sassy manner
She hold herself in a high standard
And hella suckers in the hood ain't never ran in her
Young tender thoroughbred born winner
I know you're busy but you need to holler at your nigga
I won't scare you away with fast talk and game
I wanna know if I can have you but I start with your name
Who you with? you say that you ain't got no mayn?
I'm tryin to tell you, girl, I let you star on my team
A play-maker, make a player slow his pace up
The type of face a brother wanna see when he wake up
She work hard nine to five, sometimes longer
Goes to school at night, you see, she got big goals
And I don't wanna bring you down, I just wanna come along
Make you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old
See, let this truth be told, I'm tryin to leave that fast life alone
To find a woman of my own, so we can get together and build
A foundation that's real and everyday I make you feel like a mill'

[Chorus:]
You got me wide open
But you ain't even knowin

{Shima}
You ain't knowin that I'm wide open
You got me goin and it's showin
That I want you
You ain't feelin me
I'm caught up indeed
You got me slippin and I'm trippin
Off the things you do

[Verse 2:]
You think I'm runnin drag, but I ain't even mad
I bet you all my cash I be the realest that you had
I wanna treat you lav', but you can't see that half
I'm tryin to keep you smilin if you just give me a chance
At times you make me laugh, you got me wide open
You think it's all a front, swear you ain't even knowin
If I was runnin drama on ya
I woulda bend in the wind, baby, hittin corners
Instead I'm standin right beside you like you know I'm 'posed to
Keepin composure, while most fools be in your face just tryin to get over
I see you know my style, me and my mob is wild
I hear your friends say I'm not trustworthy
But if you wait a while I shut that madness down
Proove to you once and for all that I'm deservin
Of your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your time
If it's cool, boo, then give me a sign
Now I ain't tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me
I say ain't tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me

{Shima}
See I been waitin all my life
To find someone like you
And now that it's finally you and me
There's no time to lose
You're on my mind seven days a week
No matter what they say
Cause even though your style is wild
I like the way you do your thing
Baby, I'm wide open, too
I'm lovin me somethin new
