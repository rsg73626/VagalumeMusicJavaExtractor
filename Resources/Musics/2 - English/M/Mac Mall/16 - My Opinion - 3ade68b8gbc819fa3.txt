MY OPINION

My name is young Mac Mall mayne, and this is my opinion,
and since I got your attention theres some shit I'd like to mention,
fuck them punk ass rollers them highway type of strollers,
cause they be wanting to bust them big fat caps in ghetto souljas,
I guess they wanna fold us, but see we won't just have that,
because I'm from the streets in '93 and playas bust back,
I might just be a dead man
because I speak rebellion,
they ready did malcom x and docter king
there ain't no tellin',
the government they hatin me,
but still I pack .380,
thats why I wont come back
uncle sammy never paid me
and todays the pay day,
I'm standin in the cuts fuckin it up with my AK-
47 ways them black brothas won't behave,
and since I'm stressed I'm on quest to bend them in they grave
I'm trying to go to school but the system wasn't havin me,
some say it's technicality but this is just reality,
in 1992 you know crazy i was feelin

My name is young Mac Mall man and this is my opinion,
I had to set up shop, but it ain't what I be dealin
the ghetto type of feelin,
the drug money killin, I speaken playa styles
its gon make me a million,
I'm tryin to burry happily but fools be wantin to cap on me,
thats why i plant in my coat, its something dope,
i bepackin G,
it's gonna be a tragedy, on your whole family,
so call them punk police, them little old pussies can't even handle me,
you might think I'm a criminal, but this is not subliminal,
I'm tryin to spit that knowledge to my folks but you don't hear me though,
some might think I rock gang fuss, but all I want is justice,
and my chance to get on the mike and spit game to these hustles
and if you like the realnes
you might think this appealing

Cause now I got my chance, to speak my opinion freely,
they need to fit on blinders cuz these fouls dont want to see me
I'm poppin like a preemy, sometimes I wear a beenie,
its on like that toja kuz that dolja got me dreamy,
when fools be pimpatraten,
it's causin me frustration,
and theres no hesitation
in a snitch assassination,
Mac Mall is just a youngsta, hustla, thugsta,
but if you feen for dope ass raps foul im a pluck ya,
and mothafuckas, them brothas,
is from another planet
they must dont understand it, How they take they life for granted,
so tell me can you really fuck with this young,
but I take you on a ride in the trunk side up,
and with luck, maybe they can find ya, and sign ya,
off as a loss cause you toss of my penis,
breathin if you live, make dibs on the woodbox,
I be kickin tha rocks and shit, and don't sport tha dreadlocks
