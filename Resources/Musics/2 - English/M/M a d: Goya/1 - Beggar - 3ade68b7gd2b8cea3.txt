BEGGAR

The cold wind is blowing 
you have frozen to the bones 
can you feel the blue clouds are bleeding 
you live your life without home 

so many times you wake up and see 
so many times you wish to be me 
so many times you got nothing to eat 


The beggar -nobody hears you call 
The beggar -is shredding my soul 
The beggar -living his life alone 
The BEGGAR 

so many times I have see you without smile 
your life is torture nobody knows why 
and you are felling you're feeling so alone
