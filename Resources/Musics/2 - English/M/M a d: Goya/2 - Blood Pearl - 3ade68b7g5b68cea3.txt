BLOOD PEARL

Vicious life I've choose by my will 
Who can forgive anything 
No one knows, night brings desire 
For the darkness's falling abyss 

BLOOD PEARL! 

I'm cutting remains 
Glossy eyes, body lies 
Never will give up 
Bloody gore, more and more 
Till his visions gets satisfy 

Blood pearl ! 

It's hard to tell ya' I'm thinking on you 
it's easy to do it licking up, licking down 

Impaled life's fading your body 
Strangulation, one-way of mine 
Showing you darkest desire 

STANGULATION OF REALITY, THE SENSE FOR BLOOD! 

Mind control in self-destruction 
Laceration of reality 
The sense for blood 
Enchanting my insanity 

I'm near in every second, a fascinate fear I bringâ€¦ 

Beaming up your arms, attracts me 
From this moment to eternity 
Sharp my knife with greed 
Prey for a ritual of serial killer 

Indulgence in blood causing funerals 
Hells hate potion 

Blood pearl !
