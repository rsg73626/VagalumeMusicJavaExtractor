THE LOST BOYS

Open my eyes, What do I see ? 
Clash with reality 
Open cages, melancholic remains, 
My last act - reality, 
You can fuck me, than cut me, Fucking eat me raw, But you'll never change my opinion 

Salvation, Revolt 

It's our choice, we never will bow 
Raise your fists - Last boys, Last boys! 
It's revenge upon filth of law 
Birth your pain - Last boys, Last boys ! 
Go away, running, ablaze your sun, There's no chance for them ! Last boys !, Last boys! 
…Last…
