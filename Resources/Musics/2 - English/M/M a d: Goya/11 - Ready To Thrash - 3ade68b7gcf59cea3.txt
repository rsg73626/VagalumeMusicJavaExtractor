READY TO THRASH

Do you feel how your body is being plagued?
By emptiness that’s growing in you?
Many years suffered by problems
How much you can take

This feeling bites the pain i carry in solitude
When time is money, what price is love?
Bitterness, rejection, contempt
Began to plague me for days

Lack of harmony, meant that global law enforcement
Was impossibility, personal greed led to growing crime?
To war on a epic scale…

This feeling bites the pain, i carry in solitude
When time is money, what price is love?
Bitterness rejection, contempt
Began to plague me for days

Trying to find normality, you bury all the pain
And curse the day you caught your breath
The person i despise is living behind my curtain
