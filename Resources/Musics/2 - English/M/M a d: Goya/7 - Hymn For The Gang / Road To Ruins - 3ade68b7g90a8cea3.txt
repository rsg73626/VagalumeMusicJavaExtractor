HYMN FOR THE GANG / ROAD TO RUINS

…And so it began, life like an endless night 
Drug has ruined my visions, like grave-land in my life 
It goes on and on, from seed to seed 
I haven't seen solutions, from horrifying conclusion 

Hunger for the needle, never leave me free cause' 
Only the thing on my mind is to find some money 
Thirst for destruction, I' am ready to kill you 
It's time to die!!! 
So freeze! You can't stomp all over me 
Give me your money, if you don't want bleed 
So freeze! You can't stomp all over me 
Satisfy my demons or I make you… bleed!!!
