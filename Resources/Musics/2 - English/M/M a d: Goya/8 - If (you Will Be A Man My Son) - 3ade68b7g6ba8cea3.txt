IF (YOU WILL BE A MAN MY SON)

If you can keep your head,when all about you
Are losing and blaming it on you
If you can trust yourself
When all men doubt you
But make allowance
For their doubting too

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
Or watch the things you gave your life to
Broken and stoop and build'em up with
Worn out tools

If you can dream
And not make dreams your master
If you can think
And not make thoughts your aim
If you can meet - with triumph and disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting
Or being lied about don't deal in lies
Or being hateed don't give way to hating
And yet don't look too good, not talk to wise

You'll be a man my son
Impostors, impasters
