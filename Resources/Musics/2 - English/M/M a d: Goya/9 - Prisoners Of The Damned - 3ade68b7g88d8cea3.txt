PRISONERS OF THE DAMNED

Our planet is rotting at the distance
Our nature is dying day by day
Acid rain is falling on you
Woods are passing away
Our life is living prison
Our life is full of pain

Prisoners of the damned
Are waiting for the end,
Open our eyes and we'll see
Sick humanity

Look over around the world
People hate each other
Wind of war and suffering
Has blown earth into living hell

Corruption, greed till end
Plague and nuclear warfare's
Awake us and we'll see
Life is another bad dream

Prisoners of the damned
Are waiting for the end
Only blind eyes don't see
Pain and ......agony
