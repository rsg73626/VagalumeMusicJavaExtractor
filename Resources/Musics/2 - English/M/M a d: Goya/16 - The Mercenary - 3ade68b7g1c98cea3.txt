THE MERCENARY

(the victim) : "are you a contract solider ?"
(the mercenary) : "no, i've just been traveling for a long, long time … searching for gray doors of my casket…why do you care any way ?"
(the victim): "who are you i want to know ?"
(the mercenary):"i'm what i 'am…"

Trapped in the maze of pain,
War- dark hole in my life
Deep scars in my mind,
My crown - trudgen down
Slimness link has been snapped
Mentally breakdown
I can't find myself
Trauma is crushing me
Like decade in the mud

The mercenary flows
Through the river of wars
Shouting in fear
And than you hear, another hailstorm
In the ruins land …
