SHINE IT ON

Just when you thought I was gone 
from afar I'm back like a shooting star, 
Couldn't see right from the wrong 
So I run… and still the darkness calls 

Shine It on… Shine a light on me, 
Shine it on… electricity.. turn it on 
Like you're laser beam…. 
Shine It on… you're burying up my dreams 
Shine It on… 
Come on and just shine it on! 

I was a shadow of you … innocent 
Fading just like a dawn 
Give it all that I had.. 
It was hell, untill my darkness fell! 

Shine It on… Shine a light on me, 
Shine it on… electricity.. turn it on 
Like you're laser beam…. 
Shine It on… you're burying up my dreams 

Shine it on… 
Come on and just shine it on 

Do what you feel 
Turn back time 
cause you know your journey 
You shouldn't defend, just hit and run and you gone 
You blew them all away! 

Shine It on… Shine a light on me, 
Shine it on… electricity.. turn it on 
Like you're laser beam…. 
Shine It on… you're burying up my heart 

Shine it on.. come on and just shine it on 

Shine It on… Shine a light on me, 
Shine it on… electricity.. turn it on 
Like you're laser beam…. 
Shine It on… you're burying up my heart 

Shine it on.. come on and just shine it on!
