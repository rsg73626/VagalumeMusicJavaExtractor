A DREAM

I wish you'd have your sun with you...

When darkness comes I feel myself like a beast 
I try to hide myself away from this dream 
I never make it, no it catches me 
and in that dream you are so gentle and real 
I don't know 

if I fall apart or save my breaking heart 
how many nights it takes to overcome? 

Chorus: 
All sunny moments we shared 
and how we laughed how we cared 
it was so real so special 
and after those lonely nights 
there will be sun in my sky 
I wish you'd have your sun with you 

It seems to me you'll never understand 
but still I'm reaching out for you till I can 
I never make it, you are so cold 
and deep inside I feel it's time to go 
so tell me 
why did you play with me 
oh,now I really see 
that I am strong enough to leave behind
