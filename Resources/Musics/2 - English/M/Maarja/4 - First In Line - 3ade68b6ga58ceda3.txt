FIRST IN LINE

Constricted dreams
that sleeps in my mind
now seem to guide me in my daily life
I raise a glass for
those tears gone by
A ray of hope upon my newborn eyes

I'm turning to the window
full of memories
I'm turning to the frontstep
with keys

I'm gonna get first in line
from a jack to a king
wanting everything
Gonna get first this time
letting go, my heart of stone

I'm gonna get first in line
from a jack to a king
wanting everything
Gonna get first this time
letting go, my heart of stone

Getting first in line/getting first this time
letting everything go
Getting first this time/getting first in line
let the whole world know

This mighty sword's full of dust
but it thrives
I wipe it clean
and let it come alive
I'm all made up
by the things that I feel
Too many words
can turn your heart in to steel

I'm turning to the window
full of memories
I'm turning to the frontstep
with keys

I'm gonna get first in line
from a jack to a king
wanting everything
Gonna get first this time
letting go, my heart of stone

I'm gonna get first in line
from a jack to a king
wanting everything
Gonna get first this time
letting go, my heart of stone

Getting first in line/getting first this time
letting everything go
Getting first this time/getting first in line
let the whole world know

I'm turning to the window
full of memories
I'm turning to the frontstep
with keys
