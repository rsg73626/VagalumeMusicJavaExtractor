FORBIDDEN LAND KEELATUD MAA

Why hide yourself in yesterday?
When you disappear
you remain there.
I find you for the hundredth time
Still, the abyss between us
gets deeper, I feel.
But if I give up
you'll be lost for good.

ref. On forbidden land
I wander again
Looking for you
but a bound keeps us apart.
This forbidden land
like a fog in front of me,
I hope it'll clear up some day.

If I can't find you,
seeking the days run out.
Even being near me
you don't know, hear or see me.
I still see you
remaining again in yesterday.

ref. On forbidden land...

..I'll bring you back from there
I promise I'll do...
..from forbidden land...
..this forbidden land...
..can't keep you for ever
..it'll disappear between us

ref. (mod back voc)
On forbidden land
I wander again
Looking for you
but a bound keeps us apart.
This forbidden land
won't keep you for ever
