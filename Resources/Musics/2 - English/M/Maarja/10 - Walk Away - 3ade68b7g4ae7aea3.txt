WALK AWAY

Tried to give you everything
but I got nothing in return
I can imagine better business baby
Never heard of give 'n' take
never been of your concern
and I realise the difference baby

You treat me like you got no soul
I believe your life is still without no goal

So baby I'll walk away
I'll walk away from you
I feel our love's passé
and the feelings are all through
So baby I'll walk away
I'll walk away from you
You know it's true
There's nothing else to do

Every feeling that I had
has vanished in the haze
I believe they will remain unfound and
memories I leave behind
forgetting all them days
and I think you still don't understand it

I really feel like wasting time
cause I don't share your way of quality of life

So baby I'll walk away
I'll walk away from you
I feel our love's passé
and the feelings are all through
So baby I'll walk away
I'll walk away from you
You know it's true
There's nothing else to do

Tried to give you everything
but I got nothing in return
Never heard of give 'n' take
never been of your concern
That's why I walk away
