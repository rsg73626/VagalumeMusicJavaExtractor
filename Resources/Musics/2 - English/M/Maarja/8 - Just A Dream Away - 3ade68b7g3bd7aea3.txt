JUST A DREAM AWAY

There is a place where lovers go
when they want to be alone
away from the world

Happiness is just a dream away
I feel it
when I am here with you

Could this be a magic
sent from somewhere high above
Could this be the moment
when I find my way to love

Raindrops and angels wings
and all of the happy things
that's what you've given to me

How could I ever leave
when there is heaven
in the air we breathe

Could this be a magic
sent from somewhere high above
Could this be the moment
when I find my way to love

When there is emptiness
and no-one share
the special things you have in your life

Keep reaching out until you find
that someone
to make everything right
