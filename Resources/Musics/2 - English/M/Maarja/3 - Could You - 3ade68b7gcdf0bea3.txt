COULD YOU

Just look at you
You haven't a clue
Hidden feelings
Things I wan't forget
You'd cheat and you'd lie
The crimes you can't deny
It's over now
Baby it's over now

Chorus:
Could you just do yourself a favour
and say "goodbye" now
Could you just turn around and die
Could you just come to see your neighbour
and stay forever
Could you just disappear tonight
So run away and cry
So run away and cry
Could you

I've been betrayed
You cheat and you straight
You're no hero
It's time to pay the price
You're nothing, but scum
This feeling makes me numb
So now's the time
It's time to bring this chance

Chorus: ...

I'm not afraid
The mares will fade
'Cause I know that
you can't so think to me
I've had enough
You treated me so rough
And I see the evil
Evil in your eyes

Chorus: ...

Could You
Could You
Could You

So run away and cry
just run away and cry

Could You
Could You
Could You

So run away and cry
just run away and cry

Could You
Could You
Could You
