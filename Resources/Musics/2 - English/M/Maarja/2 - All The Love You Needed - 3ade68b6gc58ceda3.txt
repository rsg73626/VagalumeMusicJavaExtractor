ALL THE LOVE YOU NEEDED

You are trying hard to find
an image in your mind
you held so high
Every hour every day
you get loneliness away
by moving on

You just never had the time
to stop and see the sign

Cause all the love you needed was always close at hand
still you couldn´t understand ( all you needed)
All the love you needed was always to be found
if you only turned around (if you only turned around)

You always needed to move on
the feeling grew so strong
within you
You were reaching for the sky
time just passed you by
as you went on

You just never had the time
to stop and see the sign

Cause all the love you needed was always close at hand
still you couldn´t understand ( all you needed)
All the love you needed was always to be found
if you only turned around (if you only turned around)

Cause all the love you needed was always close at hand
still you couldn´t understand ( all you needed)
All the love you needed was always to be found
if you only turned around 

Cause all the love you needed was always close at hand
still you couldn´t understand ( all you needed)
All the love you needed was always to be found
if you only turned around (if you only turned around)

All the love you needed
All the dreams you had
All the love you needed
if you only turned around

All the love you needed
All the dreams you had
All the love you needed
if you only turned around

All the love
