I WONDER

When the leaves have turned to yellow
colder winds freeze me through
Seems to me that I was dreamin'
when I hoped you wanted me too
Maybe I'm a fool who loved you

but I learned from time to time
I believe that love's
no friend of mine

And I wonder
I wonder why a real life
always is so hard to find
I wonder why it's always
hard to leave it all behind
But I believe that one day
I will find my one true love

Through the night
of darkest winter
I can't count the
times I've cried
It's so hard to understand
still my tears
just haven't dried
Used to be
so very easy
Just to give my heart away
Now I've learned to save it for
a special day

And I wonder
I wonder why a real life
always is so hard to find
I wonder why it's always
hard to leave it all behind
But I believe that one day
I will find my one true love
I, I wonder why
