SALAD DAYS

As I'm getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die

La, la, la, la
Ohh

Missing hippy Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell 'em so long

La, la, la, la
Ohh

Oh mama, actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign

La, la, la, la
Ohh

Salad days are gone, missing hippy Jon
Remembering things just to tell 'em so long

La, la, la, la
Ohh

Oh mama, actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year
