STILL BEATING

I never meant to make her cry
And now I'm seeing tears in her eyes
Half and half, make-believe
'Cause so she thought that my heart was on my sleeve

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating

I never thought some silly songs could ever go and hurt someone
I never meant to sing my tune for anybody else out there but you

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating
