BLUE BOY

[Verse 1]
Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes
Worried, every time the sun shines

Worried
About his
Haircut

Calm down
Sweetheart
Grow up

[Chorus]
Blue Boy (x4)

[Verse 2]
Blue Boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes

No use
Acting
So tough

Calm down
Sweetheart
Grow up

[Chorus]
Blue Boy (x4)
