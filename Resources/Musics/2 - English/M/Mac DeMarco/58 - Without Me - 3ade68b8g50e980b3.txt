WITHOUT ME

[Verse 1]
Will she love me again tomorrow
I don't know, don't think so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

[Chorus]
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me

[Verse 2]
Will she find love again tomorrow
I don't know, I hope so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

[Chorus]
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me
