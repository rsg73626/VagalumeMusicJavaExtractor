EUROPEAN VEGAS

So you think you're lonely
You think that you're the only one
Baby, listen closely
Let me be your number one
The city's getting colder
The streets are turning into ice
So baby, hold me closer
Let me stay for one more night

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

So baby, take my hand
Walking down the avenue
I know you wanted Paris
I guess that this will have to do
So come on, quit your dreaming
Girl, I got the master plan
The city isn't so bad
When you're with your lover man

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
