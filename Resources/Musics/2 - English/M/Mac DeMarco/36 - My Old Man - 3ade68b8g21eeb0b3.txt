MY OLD MAN

Look in the mirror
Who do you see?
Someone familiar
But surely not me
For he can't be me
Look how old and cold and tired
and lonely he's become
Not until you see
There's a price tag hanging off of having that fun

Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Walk on the outside, holding her hand
Someone familiar, her and her man
But it just can't be
Look at all the steps that brought you
where you are today
Not until you see
As the heart grows stronger
sometimes love gets pushed away

Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
