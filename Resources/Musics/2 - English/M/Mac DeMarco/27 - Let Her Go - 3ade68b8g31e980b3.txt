LET HER GO

[Verse 1]
Tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her know

[Verse 2]
Growing by the hour
Love just like a flower
But when the flower dies
You've got to say goodbye
And let her go

[Chorus]
Let her go

[Verse 3]
Tell her that you'll be there
If you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to
Make the heart grow fond
But it don't

[Verse 4]
So tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her go

[Chorus]
Let her go
Yeah!

[Spoken]
Or you can keep her
It's okay
It's up to you
Make your own choice
Whatever you gotta do
God bless
