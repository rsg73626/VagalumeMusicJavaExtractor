COOKING UP SOMETHING GOOD

Mommy's in the kitchen
Cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa
Pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet
It seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight
With my cigarette

Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

Daddy's in the basement
Cooking up something fine
While rick's out on the pavement
Flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming
I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight
Chewing nicorette

Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
