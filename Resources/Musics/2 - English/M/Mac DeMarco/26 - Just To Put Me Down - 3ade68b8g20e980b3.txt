JUST TO PUT ME DOWN

[Verse 1]
She couldn't be from up above
I never want another one
Like her coming around

[Refrain]
Picking me up
Just to put me down

[Verse 2]
She couldn't be from down below
For if she was, my heart would know
And when it knows it just won't go
Down

[Refrain until fade]
Picking me up
Just to put me down
