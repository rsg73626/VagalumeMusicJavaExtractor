CHANGE THE WORLD

If I could reach the stars
I'd pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
And this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world

If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way

And our love would rule
This kingdom we have made
Till then I'll be a fool
Wishin' for the day

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
