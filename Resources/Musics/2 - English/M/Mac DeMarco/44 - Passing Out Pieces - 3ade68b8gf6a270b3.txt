PASSING OUT PIECES

Watching my life, passing right in front of my eyes
Hell of a story, or is it boring?
can't claim to care, never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me, don't you know
nothing comes free?

What mom don't know has taken its toll on me
it's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
it's hard to believe what it's made of me

Passing my life, living it out with her side
Listening closely, feeling it mostly
can't shake concern, seizing it every time that I turn
I'm passing out pieces of me
don't you know nothing comes free?

What mom don't know has taken its toll on me
it's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
it's hard to believe what it's made of me
