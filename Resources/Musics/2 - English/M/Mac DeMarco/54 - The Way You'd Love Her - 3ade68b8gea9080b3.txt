THE WAY YOU'D LOVE HER

How's your heart been beating?
How's your skin been keeping?
How's your dream been going
Since you've came back home this time?
You left her out there somewhere
Don't know how you feel but
Never really got your chance to show her
What it really means to love her

The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her
Closer to the ending
She's still not pretending
Crying eyes won't recognize
The way she feels about him

She'll just go on living
The river keeps on rolling
Rolling all the time she'll never
Understand just what it means to love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her

The way you'd love her
Love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her
