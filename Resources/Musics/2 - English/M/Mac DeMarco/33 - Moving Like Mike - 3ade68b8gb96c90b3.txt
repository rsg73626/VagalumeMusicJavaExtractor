MOVING LIKE MIKE

Take a step to the left and you're alright
Got the snake skins on
Another step to the right in the moonlight
Shake it all night long

You really gotta let it all hang loose
When you're moving like Mike
You really gotta
Let me shake my boots
When you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out
When you're moving like Mike
So come on baby
Let me hear you shout
When you're moving like Mike

Dipping down to the slow spotlight, baby
Take my hand
Another step to the right in the moonlight
Baby, I'm your man

You really gotta let it all hang loose
When you're moving like mike
You really gotta
Let me shake my boots
When you're moving like mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out
When you're moving like mike
So come on baby
Let me hear you shout
When you're moving like mike

You really gotta let it all hang loose
When you're moving like mike
You really gotta
Let me shake my boots
When you're moving like mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out
When you're moving like mike
So come on baby
Let me hear you shout
When you're moving like mike
