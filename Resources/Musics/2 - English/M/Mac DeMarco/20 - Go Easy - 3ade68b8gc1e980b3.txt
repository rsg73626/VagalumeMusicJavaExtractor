GO EASY

Pack it up and leave it
Leave it all behind you
Startin' fresh in someone else's town
And though we may be leavin'
I'll be right beside you
To pick you up, until you come around

[Chorus]
So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy

Now you can be tough
Without your friends beside you
You built up, just to knock it down
So when you're feelin' rough
I'll be right behind you, to pick you up
Until you come around

[Chorus] [X2]
So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
