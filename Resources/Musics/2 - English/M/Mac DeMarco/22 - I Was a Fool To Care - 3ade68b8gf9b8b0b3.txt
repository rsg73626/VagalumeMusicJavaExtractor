I WAS A FOOL TO CARE

I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you

Had I listened to the grapevine
I might have had my doubts
But I did my level best just to block them out
Cause love is so unwise and love has no eyes
And it took a while for a fool to see
What his friends were on about

I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you

Imagining your face
It almost fills the empty space before me
I can see you eyes and almost hear your lovely lies
I wish I was an old man
And love was through with me
I wish I was a baby on my mama's knee
I wish I was a freight train moving down the line
Just keeping track of time
Without all these memories

I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Baby, yes, I am
I could have opened my eyes
I could have seen through your lies
I could have stood for no more
I could have walked out the door

I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care, I was a fool to care
You weren't nothing but a fool to care
Just a country fool to care
