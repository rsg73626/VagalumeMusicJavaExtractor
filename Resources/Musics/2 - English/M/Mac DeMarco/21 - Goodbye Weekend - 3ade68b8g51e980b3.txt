GOODBYE WEEKEND

[Verse 1]
Goodbye, weekend
So long, darling
Macky's been a bad, bad boy
And when they're preaching
Be sure to change me
Should rearrange me
Or so they thought

[Chorus]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know
that you're wasting your time

[Verse 2]
Sort me, place me
Give me a sign
Repeat the mantra
When you're stepping out of line
Give me, a number
Something to be
Might help out for the country boy
But it won't work out on me

[Chorus]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know
that you're wasting your time

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know
that you're wasting your time

Ah, Gigi Bungsu
