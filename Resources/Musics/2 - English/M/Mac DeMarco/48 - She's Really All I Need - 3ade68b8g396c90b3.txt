SHE'S REALLY ALL I NEED

Up out of bed at 3
And I feel like im dying
But if she's there next to me
Then there's no use in crying
Cause she's really all I need
It's true, my heart is flying
Life can be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

Don't bring me down man
Wearing that frown man now
Its trials from my brain step into my frame now

I smell your arts degree
It's telling me I'm lazy
I'm working so I can eat
So keep that shit away from me
Cause she's really all I need
And up until I'm dying
Life will be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

Don't bring me down man
Wearing that frown man now
Its trials from my brain step into my frame now
