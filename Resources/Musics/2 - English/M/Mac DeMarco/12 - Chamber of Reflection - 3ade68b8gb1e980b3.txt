CHAMBER OF REFLECTION

[Verse 1]
Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day
You're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run
With better men

[Chorus]
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

[Verse 2]
No use looking out
It's within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear
Among the better men

[Chorus]
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
