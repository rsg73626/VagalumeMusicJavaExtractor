BABY'S WEARIN' BLUE JEANS

Standing on the corner
Trying to keep it clean
A fine lookin' woman
In a pair of Lees
Take her back to my place
Lay her down in bed
And after she's stripped down
I say "leave 'em on instead"

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

I see you in the evening
Keep 'em on in the tub
Washin' wearing Wranglers
I think that I'm in love
Straight fit over bootcut
I'm begging down and please
Stay with me forever
Don't take off those jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
