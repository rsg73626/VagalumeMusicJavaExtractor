ONLY YOU

Only you, only you
Only you can treat me like you do
And only she, only she, o
Only she chose me when I'm blue
So sorry, boo, we're through

I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down
'Cause I'm done crying over her

Here I am, brand new day
Now things do, let me show you, boo
And only she, only she
Only she chose me when I'm blue
So sorry, boo, we're through

'Cause I'm done getting over her
I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down

Lay down, lay down, lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down, lay down
