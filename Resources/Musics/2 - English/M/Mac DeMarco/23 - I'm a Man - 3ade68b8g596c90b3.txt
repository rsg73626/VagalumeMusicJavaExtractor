I'M A MAN

Creeping around
Up and downtown
Got the late night shift
Rolling up like this
Got a fresh pack of 'Roys
The vice of this boy
Try to strut as I walk
When I'm cruisin' my block

Cause I'm a man (man)
Cause I'm a man (man)
Cause I'm a man (man)
Cause I'm a man (man)

Try to keep myself clean
For no one I've seen
Wearing all kind of shit
That really don't fit
Five hundred and ones
Fit for this son
A pair of Levi's jeans
You know what I mean

Cause I'm a man (man)
Cause I'm a man (man)
Cause I'm a man (man)
Cause I'm a man (man)
