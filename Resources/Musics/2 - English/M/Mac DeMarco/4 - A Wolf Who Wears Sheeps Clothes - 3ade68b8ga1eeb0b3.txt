A WOLF WHO WEARS SHEEPS CLOTHES

ust trying to keep it light sometimes casts a shadow
Trouble is keeping quiet and you know well
where your heart goes
The trouble's with meeting anybody
these days are bringing you down
All predisposed to believe him in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah

Don't let the world outside the windowpane get to your head
Hopefully you make some sense
of all this shit before you're dead
The trouble's with meeting anybody, follow wherever you go
All predisposed to believe him
in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah
