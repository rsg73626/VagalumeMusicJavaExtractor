BROTHER

[verse 1]
You're no better off
Living your life
Than dreaming at night
This much is true
But it's still up to you
To take my advice

[pre-chorus]
To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

[chorus]
Go home, go home
Go home, go home

[verse 2]
You're better off dead
When your mind? s been set
From nine until five
How could it be true
Well it's happened to you
So take my advice

[pre-chorus]
To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

[chorus]
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
