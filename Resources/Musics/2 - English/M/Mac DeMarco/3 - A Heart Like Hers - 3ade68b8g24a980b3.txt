A HEART LIKE HERS

Done, done is all the love
Love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone with my heart
Locked inside a cage for you

And what's this that has become
Has become of poor old me
Try so hard to believe
In somehting that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

All, all that I could give
All I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away
No longer there to bother her

Now look, look at what's become
What's become of poor old me
Try so hard to believe
In something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe
