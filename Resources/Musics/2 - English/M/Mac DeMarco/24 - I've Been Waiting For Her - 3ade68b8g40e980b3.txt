I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HER

[Verse 1]
Give up my life for the rhythm
For the beat of a heart
Like hers
Start it over to the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

[Chorus]
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

[Verse 2]
Listen closely for the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
Could I quit it?
Start it over
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

[Chorus]
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
