ON THE LEVEL

Boy, this could be your year
You're making old man proud of you
Forget about the tears

On the level
See me eye-to-eye
Stand up like a man
Even from the underside

On the level
On the level

Man, I never had a choice
Never had a chance
Never had a voice

On the level
Carrying a name
Fall until my final days
Now who's there left to blame?

On the level
On the level

On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
