FOR THE FIRST TIME

While she's been away
Living day-to-day has been tough
I found her at my side
Simply being alive's been rough

You know she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

The time she's not around
Somewhere out-of-town has been hard
But somehow this old heart found time to work it on
