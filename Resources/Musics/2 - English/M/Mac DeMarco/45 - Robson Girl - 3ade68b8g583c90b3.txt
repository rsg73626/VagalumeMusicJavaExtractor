ROBSON GIRL

Maybe when we're older
We can try this over
Loving on the sidelines
Another one of my kind

Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
Robson girl, sit down by your daddy

No one else's shoulder
I felt could be colder
Loving on the sidelines
Just one straight on my mind

Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
