ANOTHER ONE

Feeling so confused
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you
Anymore

And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be
Knocking at her door?

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

The feeling never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishing for tomorrow
Today

She still said she's true
So you start coming, too
Just as that old knocking
Comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
