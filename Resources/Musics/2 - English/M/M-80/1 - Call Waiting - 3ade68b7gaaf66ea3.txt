CALL WAITING

Don't tell me, I did wrong, we can talk about it.
My hands are clean anyway.
Don't change me, your no good, no it's not for last night.
All you do is a call to fight.

Don't hear me
what a fun thing to tell all your friends.
Call waiting, had done it's job and saved my life again.

Don't lie to me, I'll figure it out I could see a problem.
What is cheating anyway?
Don't do it, who's it going to be taking my place next.
I hope it's not the guy from last night.

Don't hear me
what a fun thing to tell all your friends.
Call waiting, had done it's job and saved my life again, don't tell me.
Calling all night wasting my time.
Call waiting is stopping it now you know we had a good time.

Go, get off of my back before I attack.
All these stupid games, came out in the rain.
But I will stay sane
cause' I can't explain
go the other line
call waiting saved my life again.
