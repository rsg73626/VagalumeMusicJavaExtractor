KEEP SLIPPING AWAY

I sit here waiting as time keeps slipping away
In my heart are all the words that I want to say
Without you I  know that I, I'd wanna die
And with you I know my heart would always try

You have my heart
You have my soul
True love
It should last forever

Time's slipping away

I can't shut up my mouth I have to say how I feel
'Cause when I can't control my heart I know that it's real
I hold on tight and try to convince you to stay
And have my heart tell you what I've been dying to say

You have my heart
You have my soul
True love
It should last forever

Time's slipping away

My mind's made up and I know that I want you
Because these words and feelings of love are all true
I'll never say it but I always want you to know
As each day goes by my love continues to grow

You have my heart
You have my soul
True love
It should last forever
Forever

You don't remember me

I sit here waiting as the years keep slipping away
In my heart were all of the words that I wanted to say
I didn't get the chance to show my feelings were real
And my heart would never tell you just how I feel
My hope and dreams are crushed
And have washed away
Leaving my heart empty and without a word to say

My hope and dreams are crushed
And have slipped away
My hope and dreams are crushed
And have slipped away
