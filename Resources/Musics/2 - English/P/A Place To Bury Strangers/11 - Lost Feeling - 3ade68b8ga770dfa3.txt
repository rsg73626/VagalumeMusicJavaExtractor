LOST FEELING

If love could be the answer
then the answer would be you
if I could have a feeling
then I want it to be true
My dream have all been broken
And my past is flood with tears
Now my time is open
but the feeling's gone,
feeling has gone.

I hold on to a reason
but I've got no reason to
Try and try forever
but I won't get back to you

I'm dying to reach you
I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to hold you and
I'm dying to have you

I could try to make you stay
but the feeling's gone
the feeling has gone

Now I build up strength
and I'll build it up to
cut away the answer and
I hope it get to you

And I'm dying to reach you
And I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to hold you
and I'm dying to have you

some things never go away
but the feeling's gone
the feeling is gone.
