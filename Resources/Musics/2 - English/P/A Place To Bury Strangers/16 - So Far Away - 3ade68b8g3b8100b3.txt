SO FAR AWAY

The or the laws that I follow
Cause of the life today
So I'm talking I feel over the shadow

I couldn't  refil you
Cause you move faster
Did you tried and feel  like I was today
So it's down to skill
So it's  just a death
But feel it, so far away

For ever these cry
How I

The resistance  consider different, so far away
No one stading then why does it all fall far away
