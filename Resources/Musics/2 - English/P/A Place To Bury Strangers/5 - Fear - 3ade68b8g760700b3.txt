FEAR

Not another second to lose
You just walk away
You see it's gone

Not another second to live
And you hear my voice
And now it's gone

Whatever happened to our love
It seems so strange to me
That you're running away

And then I think of what I've done
And it's not strange to me
That you're running away

It's a fear

Do you think of me now?
Just you and me
What I wouldn't do or say
And I feel like I was left alone
And it's like needles to my heart
And I won't go back because I won't

Whatever happened to our love
And it's so strange to me
That you're running away

And when I think of what I've done
Than it's not strange to me
That you're running away

It's a fear
