IT IS NOTHING

Oh no don't feel it's right
Fall apart let's not fight
Make up stay tonight
Feel alone it's alright
It is nothing

Hope lust life went wrong
See now it's all gone
No no don't hold on
Feel good what went wrong
It is nothing

Oh no don't fell it's right
Make up stay tonight
Fall apart let's not fight
Feel alone it's alright
It is nothing
