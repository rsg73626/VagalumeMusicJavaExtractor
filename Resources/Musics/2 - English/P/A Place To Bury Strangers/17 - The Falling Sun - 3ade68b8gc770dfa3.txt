THE FALLING SUN

Your love, a waste of time
I watch, I watched it fade away
It takes me away
It takes me through the day
I can see it now, so little left
I feel it fade today
I feel you in the breeze
Surrounded everyday, walk away

?

Your love, a waste of time
I watch, I watched it fade away
It takes me through the days
It takes me through
Your eyes, I can see now, I always see
I feel it fade from me
I sense you in the trees
Surrounded everyday, walk away

?
