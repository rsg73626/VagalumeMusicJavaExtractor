DEADBEAT

Oh
Hear the sound
On the tracks and on the run
Now
Now you're down
Stupid shit you better run

What
What the fuck?
Don't play with my heart
I said what
What the fuck?
Don't play with my heart
Who am I

Dream
But dream alone
Driving fast and driving thin
Dream
And dream you're home
Live in fast and live in sin

What
What the fuck?
Don't play with my heart
I said what
What the fuck?
Don't play with my heart
Who am I

You're all alone now you're all alone now you're all alone again
I said you're fucked up girl you won't come down don't take me down now no no  you're all alone again

Down
I let you in
Holding love and hold it in
Feeling bad
And looking thin
Holding on and holdin in

What
What the fuck?
Don't play with my heart
I said what
What the fuck?
Don't play with my heart
Who am I
