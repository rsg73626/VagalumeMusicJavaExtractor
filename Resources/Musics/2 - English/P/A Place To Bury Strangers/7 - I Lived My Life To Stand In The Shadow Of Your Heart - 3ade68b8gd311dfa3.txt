I LIVED MY LIFE TO STAND IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR HEART

I've lived my life
To stand in the shadow of your heart
You make my dreams complete
And then crash them down
But every dream could breathe new life
Just like the memories you had with me
I want to take you down
But now
You want me dead

The way you lie
Sends an arrow straight into my heart
You make my dreams complete
And then crash them down
But every dream could breathe new life
Maybe that's just in my head
I want to take you down
But now
You want me dead

You want me back
But I don't care
I want you back
But you're not there

I've lived my life
To stand in the shadow of your heart
You make my dreams complete
And then crash them down
But every dream could bring new life
But the close you had with
I want to take you down
But now
You want me dead

You want me back
But I don't care
I want you back
But you're not there
