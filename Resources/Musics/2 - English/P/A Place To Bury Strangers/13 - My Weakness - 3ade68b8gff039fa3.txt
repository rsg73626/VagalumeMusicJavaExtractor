MY WEAKNESS

I see you look around 
You're staring, staring out to sea 
I feel them pulling down 
You touch my hand, it all goes away 
Don't hear a single sound 
but I feel your breath in front of me 
With every kiss, I drown 
I feel my body fading to dreams 

I don't mind 
and I don't care 
and I'll do fine 
I know you're mine 
I can't believe I feel this way 
I've got the spirit inside me 
I know it can't be, can't be wrong 
I know it keeps me..

I feel my body fading to dreams 

I don't mind

and I'll do fine 
I know you're mine 
I can't believe I feel this way 
I've got the spirit inside me 
I know it can't be, can't be wrong 
I know it keeps me, keeps me strong
