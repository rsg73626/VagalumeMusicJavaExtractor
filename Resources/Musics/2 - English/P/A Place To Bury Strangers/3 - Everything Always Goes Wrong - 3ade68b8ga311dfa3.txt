EVERYTHING ALWAYS GOES WRONG

Waves wash over everything on the ground
The suns reflection blocked by a sound
The sound of life just as its ripped apart
I'd say these words to you
But fear that my heart would stay away

Yo took my hand so I showed you the place
Now it's grown empty you can see it in my face
The the sound and it rips me in half
Who'd say these things to you
If it wasn't meant to last not today

Love love love love

What comes out nails your head to the floor
I say I'm sorry as I'm walking out the door

Love love love love
