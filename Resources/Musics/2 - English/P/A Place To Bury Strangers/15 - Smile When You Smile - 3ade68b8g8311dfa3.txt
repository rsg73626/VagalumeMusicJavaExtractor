SMILE WHEN YOU SMILE

I'm a little child
Smile when you smile
Joy when you're around
And sad when you are down

'Cause I found love
I want you next to me
And I found life
With you here

You make life warm
You make me happy when you
Tell me everything will be ok hey
Let's make love
You make me happy now but
You can see my heart change with the sun
Now I'm feeling sad so I want you

I want you
I still want you
I want you
I still want

You won't talk to me
And I can't make you smile
I just bring you down
And you don't want me here
Though I still feel love
And want you next to me
'Cause I feel life
When you're around

We made life warm
We were so happy then but
You won't tell me everything's ok
We had love
And I want it all again but
I can see your heart change with the sun

Even though you're done I still want you
I want you
I still want you
I want you
I still want
