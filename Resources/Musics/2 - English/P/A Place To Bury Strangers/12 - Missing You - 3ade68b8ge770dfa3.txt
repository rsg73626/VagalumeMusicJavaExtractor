MISSING YOU

Sew It On
Face The Fool
December's Tragic Drive
When Time Is Poetry
And Stolen The World Outside
The Waiting (Could) Crush My Heart
Noooo

Sew It On
Face The Fool
The Tide Breaks A Wave Of Fear
And Brave Songs Disappear
The Secret Voice Of Dawn
This Last Time
Raise My Eyes
Noooo

You'll Taste It
You'll Taste It
When You Die (4x)

The Right Words
When You Die
The Right Words
When You Die

Sew It On
Face The Fool
The Mirrors Lie
Those Aren't My Eyes
Destroy Them
Raise My Hand
Reflects In Savage Shards
A New Face, Soul Reborn
Noooo

You'll Taste It
You'll Taste It
When You Die (4x)

The Right Words
When You Die
The Right Words
When You Die
