IN YOUR HEART

Don't say you're nice to me, alright
(you're lying)
Don't say that you'll be with me tonight
(you're lying)
Don't think I've woke up to what you said
(you cry)
There's nothing there, and it's dead

In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.

Don't say I'm not nice to you tonight
(I'm trying)
Don't say I'm not in love with you alright
(I'm crying)
Don't say that you'll be with me again
(You're lying)
There's nothing there and it's dead

In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.

In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
In your heart.
