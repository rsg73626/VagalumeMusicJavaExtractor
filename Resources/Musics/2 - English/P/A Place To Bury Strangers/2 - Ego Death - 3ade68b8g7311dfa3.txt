EGO DEATH

Leaving life with a hand to hold
And I don't wanna go back
We couldn't see 'cause our shades were on so we lift
And our ego's dead

And you were trapped in a ten foot scream
Blue stars float on a plastic screen
Give me something to feel alright
'Cause it's acid to my head
So come on

50 miles of desert sky
And you were getting me off
We couldn't talk so we sewed our words to ours shirts
Where we sewed our heads

Master feelers on light globe beams
People move and shake like trees
Give me something to feel alright
'Cause it's acid to my head
So c-c-c-come on

And you'll kick me in the head
I'm alive and I'm dead
And the colors shift like a fifty forture wall
Common fuck
Don't kill you've been alone
Stuck sick and miles from home
And the forture grips as you lose control

Engines reved and your eyes are a night
And you were getting me high
We couldn't love 'cause we break our hearts on the words where we sewed our hearts

And you been talking behind my back
And you've been talking behind my back
Give me something to feel alright
'Cause it's acid to my head
So come on

And you'll kick me in the head
I'm alive and I'm dead
And the colors shift like a fifty forture wall
Common fuck
Don't kill you've been alone
Stuck sick and miles from home
And it's acid that makes you lose
And it's acid
