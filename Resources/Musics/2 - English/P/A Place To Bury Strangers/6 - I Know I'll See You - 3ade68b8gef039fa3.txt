I KNOW I'LL SEE YOU

I just couldn't wait to see you again 
No, I never, ever turned off on friends 
Well, I thought I heard you say, and I know I feel the rain
But I can't give up looks until it's away

Now I just can't take, the way to live my life
Holding dear the last breath in my lungs 
I know I'll see you again, see you again

Don't take my hand cause I take it away
And I take everything just to take it away
Well, you can't leave me problems 
You can't give me signs 
And as it easy you give, I can take it away

Now I know the things i say
Don't hold up in the rain
Everyone was a gift straight from my heart 

Give it then, take it away
Take it away
Take it away
I take it away

I just couldn't wait to see you again 
No, I never, ever turned off on friends 
Well I thought I heard you say, and I know I feel the rain
But I can't give up looks until it's away

Don't take my hand, cause I take it away
And I take everything just take it away
I can't feel my head as it slips away 
My hands touch the ground, but I'm not safe

I just couldn't wait to see you again 
I just couldn't wait to see you again 
See you again!
