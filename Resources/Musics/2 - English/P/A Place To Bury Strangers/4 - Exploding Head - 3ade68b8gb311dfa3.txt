EXPLODING HEAD

People
Living in the dark
State protecting life then tear it apart

'Cause commotion 'cause a scene cracking skull
Expanding seam
Every time there is a choice it's tear it apart

Fall
High
Don't ever touch the ground
Know
No wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back come back come back exploding head

Touch
By the hand of God
It's a secret that is held now fire the gun

Sit down love and tighten up the pace
Commands close eyes command shoot off the face

Fall
High
Don't ever touch the ground
Know
No wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back come back come back exploding head

Lovers
Bound by their tongues
Bound by their hands
Bound by love

Intentions shadow truth and the motivation's done
The secret was a lie and the truth has never won

Fall
High
Don't ever touch the ground
Know
No wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back come back come back exploding head
