YOU'LL BE FOREVER

Maybe this is time to look into your eyes and say
All the things that we hide on our way
All the promises we made.. and all the feelings that we had
They are coming back to me.. inside my heart

And baby I love the way you make me feel
Like a child in his mother's arms
I'm feel so secure now
Because I know that you are here with me..

You will be Forever..
Forever in my heart
Now we are here together
That's nothing i want more..

I wrote your name in the sand
But the waves washed it away.
I saw your names in the stars
And i felt you inside my heart

I woke up with your taste
And the remembrance of your face
You love are in my heart
And inside me he will stay

You will be Forever..
Forever in my heart
Now we are here together
That's nothing i want more..

And i'm just thinking so much of you..
And i'm just thinking so much of you..
And i'm just thinking so much of you.. (3x)
