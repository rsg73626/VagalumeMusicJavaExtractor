DON'T SAY (IS BETTER LEAVE YOU)

You took away my breath
And leave me on my knees
You made me fall in love with you
In the first time i saw your face
And in our first touch
I told you that I can wait forever for you
You said that you felt it too
And I wanted to spend my life with you

The shine of your hair showed to me what is love 
And you brought feeling to my life
Now I want the whole world know
No one need you more than I need you

(CHORUS)

Don’t say is better leave you
I know deep inside your heart you love me too
Let me show to you tonight
How great is my feeling
Please don’t close the door
And run away, losing your breath
Feel your feelings and let them lead you
By the doubts of our love
Do you want to see a loved one in chains?
I'm sinking baby, I'm gonna drown, I'm going down
Can’t you feel the passion when I look in your eyes?
You’re the only one I need in my life

(CHORUS)

Don’t say is better leave you
I know deep inside your heart you love me too
Let me show to you tonight
How great is my feeling
