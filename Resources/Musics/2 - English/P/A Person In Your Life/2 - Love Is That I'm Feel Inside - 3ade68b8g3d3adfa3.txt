LOVE IS THAT I'M FEEL INSIDE

You've a lot of chances
To show me what is real
But you really doesn't cared
What i'm really feel
So bring me your blood
And i bring you my faith
Let me show to you
This is our fate

(CHORUS)
Love.. is that i'm feel inside
Love.. i know i cannot hide
Love.. just talk about love
If you can feel
The real love inside your heart
I have sure
You know what is survive

Battlefields, control wars
Can you control your mind?
Maybe you can, only try
But you can't control your heart
Love.. is that i'm feel inside
Love.. i know i cannot hide
Love.. show me the real meaning of love
Love.. is that i'm feel inside
Love.. i know i cannot hide

I guess you're not ready
To feel what you need to know
Just take my hand, never let me go

Love.. is that i'm feel inside
Love.. i know i cannot hide
