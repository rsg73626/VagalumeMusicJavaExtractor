EASY

I’m floating around you
Through my thoughts and all that you’ve said
I’m learning to keep all your love
And forget all your sadness and hate
Give me words
I’ll give you feelings
Give feelings and I’ll open myself to you

It’s so easy, so easy…so easy to live by your side
It’s so easy, so easy…so easy to live by your side     

Every time I go to sleep I hope to find
All the things that I’m looking for
But when morning come, bringing no answers
Maybe there is nothing to answered anymore

It’s so easy, so easy…so easy to live by your side
It’s so easy, so easy…so easy to live by your side     

Every time when I wake up
And begin to play the game again
I think I know everything
But soon I discover there are many things to learn until the night

Night falls…night falls…until the night falls
