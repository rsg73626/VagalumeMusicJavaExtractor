EVERYTHING AND NOTHING

Oh bishop of souls,
Break me out. Break me away. Make me aware.
This is the day and age.

I call out.
This will be my battle cry.
I call out.

For your kingdom, for your glory
for your eyes to fall upon me.
For your eyes like stars, to fall on my face,
a love that keeps my soul still yearning.
For your eyes like stars, to fall on my face,
a love that keeps my heart still burning.

I've been stuck at this crossroads for way too long.
Between everything and nothing, i stood
I've been stuck at this crossroads for way too long.
Without you i couldn't take one step

Break me out. Break me away. Make me aware.
This my day and age.

I can't take one step without you.
i can't take one step alone
