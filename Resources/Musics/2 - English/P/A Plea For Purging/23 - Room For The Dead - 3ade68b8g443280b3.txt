ROOM FOR THE DEAD

There's a battle for my soul
between God, the devil, and rock 'n' roll
And when my head hits the sheets
my feet will hit the ground running to heaven
Before the devil knows I'm dead

This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased, waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb

This place is a deadly room
culturing disease, waiting to burn
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb

D-D-D-D-Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine
(I need the medicine)
D-D-D-D-Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine
(I need the medicine)

Who will win the battle for my soul
between God, the devil, and rock 'n' roll?
And when my head hits the sheets
my feet are tired of running (and running and running)

This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased, waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb

This place is a deadly room
culturing disease, waiting to burn
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb

D-D-D-D-Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine
(I need the medicine)
D-D-D-D-Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine
(I need the medicine)

Murdered or the murderers, we're all the same
Kingsmen or the poorly dressed, we're pawns in this game
