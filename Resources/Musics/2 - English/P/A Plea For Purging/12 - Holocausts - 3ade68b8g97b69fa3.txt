HOLOCAUSTS

Millions of lives lost
so you can fill your pockets
millions of children slaughtered
so you can fill your pockets
when there's blood on the streets
it's time to buy
when there's blood it's time to buy

choices made
the innocent will pay
who are you to say who's to live and who's to die

profit made
millions die today
who are you to say who's to live and who's to die

one day you will burn for your decisions
and what you did with human life
so live it up now

unwanted children
forget about them
as you fill your pockets
profit off a death
you could have stopped it
but you did nothing
only the dead have seen the end of this war

when you look into the eyes of your children
i hope you see the millions you have murdered
when there's blood on the streets
there's blood on your hands
