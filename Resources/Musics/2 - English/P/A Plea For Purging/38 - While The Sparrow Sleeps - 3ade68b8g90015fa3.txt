WHILE THE SPARROW SLEEPS

Outside these city walls I sing
While the sparrow sleeps
These hands couldn't raise any higher
This heart couldn't find a deeper hole

With your blood on my hands
I speak more about You than with You
The work of my hands is not yet my prayer
If a song is just a song, will my voice be heard

You who are so close
If you would ask, then ask
How high could one man's praises raise?

With your blood on my hands
I speak more about You than with You
The work of my hands is not yet my prayer
If a song is just a song, will my voice be heard

My lips are longing for the kiss of your praises

Outside these city walls
I sing while the sparrow sleeps
These hands couldn't raise any higher
This heart couldn't find a deeper hole
