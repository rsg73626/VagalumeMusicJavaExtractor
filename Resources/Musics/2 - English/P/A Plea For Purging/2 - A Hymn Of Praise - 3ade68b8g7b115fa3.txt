A HYMN OF PRAISE

I will extol you my God
O King i will bless your name
With the reason of everyday
I will praise your name forever

One generation speaks your name
of the glorious splendor
highly to be praised

As men pour forth like a fountain
the praises of your grace
highly to be praised

I'll sing it loud, I'll sing it loud
abounding in mercy
and loving-kindness

I'll sing it loud, I'll sing it loud
your saints praise your tender mercies
highly to be praised.

O Lord, My King.
My eyes wait for you
Your open hand provides
gracious and merciful

You who are so close to me
hear my cry
hear my prayer

My lips speak your praise
I'll sing your name
forever and ever
