THE JEALOUS WINGS

Wading through the water, slow and thick.
I am aware now.
They’re not who they said they were, slipping on their words beneath the surface.

For what it’s worth I know, I’m not the man you were.
I’m living in the shadows of intent and we’re all teeth in the wolf’s mouth.

Risk and regret, thrive tonight, the masterminds of mud and mire.
Build your kingdoms up and when they fall, we’ll be watching every brick.

Speak with empty voices and knives of glass.
Easily we’re broken.
’Cause I believe the words that you speak, but never trust the lips that they are leaving.

For what it’s worth we know, we’re not the men we were.
We’re living in the shadows of intent.
We’ve all been teeth in the wolf’s mouth.

Risk and regret, thrive tonight, the masterminds of mud and mire.
Build your kingdoms up and when they fall, we’ll be watching every brick.
