A FIGHT FOR PEACE

Hell walks the earth, his name is pain
I swear to God I've seen him
He's no stranger to me, I know him well
I'll write your name into the stars

We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
Salvation for these many scars
We all have dreams at night we're scared to speak of

They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
(Can you hear me?)
Can you tell me what this all means
And why, God, am I here?

We are all the same, we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names, they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places

If all roads lead home, then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by the day
Am I in hell? (Am I in hell?)

You've taken this a step too far
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
We need you staying where you are
We all have dreams at night we're scared to speak of

They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
(Can you hear me?)
Can you tell me what this all means
And why, God, am I here?

We are all the same, we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names, they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places

If all roads lead home, then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by the day
Am I in hell? (Am I in hell?)

We all fight for peace of mind
We all fight for peace of mind
