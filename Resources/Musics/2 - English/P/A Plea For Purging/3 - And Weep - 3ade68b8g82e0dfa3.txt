AND WEEP

Your god is dead...
Your hands are soaked in blood.
You liar (Liar).
You liar.

You’re charged with death.
Murder of what’s pure.
Perverted God for a fallen youth.
They’ll follow every single word you say...
You’re charged with death.
You’re charged with death.
Sell your soul, sell your god.
Hide from all who you are.
The taste of gold tastes just like blood.

You murderer killed all my hope, murdered everything.
Innocence lost, there’s no turning back.
I question every single word you say.

You’re charged with death.
You’re charged with death.
Sell your soul, sell your god.
Hide from all who you are.
The taste of gold tastes just like blood.

Now you’ll never be able to buy back what you’ve lost.
Has it ever been worth it?
Will it ever be worth it for you?...
Has it ever been worth it?
Will it ever be worth it?
Sell your soul, sell your god.
Hide from all who you are.
The taste of gold tastes just like blood.

Your god is dead.
Your god is dead.
Your god is dead.
Your god is dead.
One eight seven.
Murder in the first degree.
You liar.
Your god is dead.
