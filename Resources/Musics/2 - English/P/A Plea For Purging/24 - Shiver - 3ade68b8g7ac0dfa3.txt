SHIVER

Cheap steps make for easy regrets, but keep your words of contempt.
You are no friend, my enemy, you tear me down, keep me weak.
I wear no crown of weakness, His is no crown of weakness.
I wear no crown of weakness, hide in your own contempt.
Iron sharpens iron, but your judgment’s dulling me.
I answer to no man. You’re no gods or masters of this world.
Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe I’m damned. I pray I don’t wake up in hell.

If I were God we’d all be dead. If I were God we’d all be dead... We’re all dead.

The devil’s hands have been busy. The devil’s hands have been busy.

Grace sustains, but I thirst for revenge. The world would be destroyed if I were God.
Demons are fallen angels. Remember that when you think you’re a saint.
Demons are fallen angels. Remember that when you think you’re a saint.

Fallen angels, I’m coming for your wings. Fallen angels, I’ll cut off your wings.
If I were God we’d all be dead. If I were God we’d all be dead.
Lord knows I’m a cynic, but I won’t give up, won’t give in.
Lord knows I’m a cynic, but I won’t give up without a fight.
The devil’s hands have been busy, turning liars to masters, demons to gods.
But we’re no gods, we’re no masters. We’re only fallen angels in this world.
