HANDS & FEET

Speak of regretting and all the risk we take
Speak to the morning and when our eyes awake
The patterns are completing, the men they say we are,

But as the sun is setting
I'll answer in the dark
When the world sings of all its trouble,
And I hear all about its pain,
I'll listen in for its groans are not in vain

It's hard to remember how these dreams were made
When all the reasons and all
The rules have changed.
There's healing in his voice
And freedom in the name
These misunderstandings we give up all the same

When the world sings of all its trouble,
And I hear all about its pain,
I'll listen in for its groans are not in vain.
