FINITE

We’re the ones you run to when your world is crashing down.
This choice made years ago is such a heavy crown.
I didn’t know it would be so hard.
That my words would mean so much.
I’m not your priest.
I’m not your prophet.
I’m not a saint.
I’m not a god.
So what now?

How did we all get here and what did we do?
How can I lead you when I’m just as weak as you.

This was built on the backs of the broken and those who need hope.
How dare we look at them and see praying hands as a means of profit.
I didn’t know it would be so hard.
That my words could hurt so much.
I am no leader, but I won’t give up on them.

I’m not your priest.
I’m not your prophet.
Open your eyes and see.
I’m not a saint.
I’m not a god.
Don’t put your faith in me.

How did we all get here and what did we do?
How can I lead you when I’m just as weak as you.
How did we all get here and what did we do?
How can I lead you when I’m just as weak as you.

I’m not your priest.
I’m not your prophet.
I’m not a saint.
I’m not a god.

How did we all get here and what did we do?
How can I lead you when I’m just as weak as you.
How did we all get here and what did we do?
How can I lead you when I’m just as weak as you... just as weak as you.
