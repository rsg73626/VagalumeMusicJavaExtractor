SICK SILENT AMERICA

We are the new free-thinkers.
My father gave me a brain, my mother taught me to use it.
So swallow back all the vomit that you’re spewing.
They’re all buying it, but I’m not buying it.
You can’t fool me anymore. You are the curse. You are the curse.
Your false prophecies darken my eyes and break my back.

The new heaven is born and hell revives.
The new heaven is born and hell revives.
The new heaven is born and hell revives.
The new heaven is born and hell revives.

As I walked along the flames of hell, it became known to me
that you are nothing but a wolf in priest’s clothing.

They’re all buying it, but I’m not buying it.
They cry, "Lead us, oh chosen one".
You are the curse. You are the curse.
Your false prophecies darken my eyes and break my back.
This is the death of faith and all that is good.

You are the curse. You are the curse.
Your false prophecies darken my eyes and break my back.

They cry, "Lead us, oh chosen one".
When the new heaven is born and hell revives.
They cry, "Lead us, oh chosen one".
When the new heaven is born and hell revives.
The new heaven is born and hell revives.
The new heaven is born and hell revives.
