MISANTHROPY

And now I become death. Ender of all worlds. I am on your tracks. I will end your world. This song tells the confession. Coward, too scared to speak the truth. I’ll tell the world for you. Coward, too scared to speak the truth. Hide behind your charm. But I know your path. I will end your world. I will end your world. I will end your world. I will end your world. Poison free, what in your case does that mean? Cause last time I checked you still need one more X. Cause that life doesn’t end at the foot of a bed. Your lifestyle ends at the foot of a bed. Oh you don’t boast of your conquests. They do for you. They’re all my friends too. Oh you don’t boast of your conquests. They do for you. They’re all my friends too. I don’t make idle threats. Watch your back. I don’t make idle threats. Watch your back. I will end you. I will no longer turn a blind eye. Know I am right behind you. Watching your every move. Planning your demise. And now I become death. Ender of all worlds. I will end your world. I will end your world. I will end your world. I will end your world.
