THE SLAYING OF THE SERPENTINE DRAGON

I chose to wave black flags

Infantry mounted, swords raise up over head
This war has raged for endless days
Upon each day the sun rose red
Flames scorched this parchment and tells of this paradise
Where battles siege and angels scream
There's blood on our hands tonight

Judas

This life was bound by blood and fire

It's just a compromise
Now go, walk away from me

This is the only chance to hang my head and rest in the Lurking of your shadows
I chose to wave black flags
Assisting lifeless until You find me, my good Samaritan
I choose to wave black flags but You love me
I know You love me
