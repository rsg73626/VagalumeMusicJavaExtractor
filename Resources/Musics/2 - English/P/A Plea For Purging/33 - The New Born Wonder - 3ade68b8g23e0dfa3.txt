THE NEW BORN WONDER

I’m lost without a sound, but I have ears to hear.

God, I’m weak and I’m tired, and I want this fighting in my head to stop.
They say, "Hang it up young man".
They say, "Hate only leaves you cold and alone".

I’m too jaded to care, too scared to run.
I let my apathy get the best of me.
I’m too jaded to care, too scared to run.
I let my apathy get the best of me.

Well, Jesus, if you can heal, I have the ears to hear (have the ears to hear).
Sing a sweet sweet song to my ear.
’Cause I pray I haven’t fallen too far.

I’m too jaded to care, too scared to run.
I let my apathy get the best of me.
I’m too jaded to care, too scared to run.
I let my apathy get the best of me.

I’m lost... lost without a sound.
I’m lost... lost... lost without a sound.
I’m lost... lost without a sound.
I’m lost... lost... lost without a sound.
I’m lost... lost without a sound.
I’m lost... lost... lost without a sound. I’m lost...

My God, if you can heal, I have the ears to hear.
My God, if you can heal, I have the ears to hear.
My God, if you can heal, I have the ears to hear.

I’m not the same kid I used to be.
I’m not the man that I need to be.
Look at what I’ve become.
Look at what you’ve become.
Look at what we’ve become.
Look at what this has made me become.
