TREMBLING HANDS

This is a song for those who’ve lost hope.
This is a song for those searching.
This is a song for those that question.
This is a song for those searching.

Question everyone.
Question everything.
And trust no one.
Everyone has a motive.
None of which are pure.
Question everyone.
Question everything.
And trust no one.
Everyone has a motive.
None of which are pure.

There are vipers.
They are liars.
There are vipers everywhere waiting to prey on you.
Watch out for their poison.
They wait to devour you.
Don’t be deceived.
Don’t be deceived.
Don’t be deceived.

Question everyone.
Question everything.
And trust no one.
Everyone has a motive.
None of which are pure.
