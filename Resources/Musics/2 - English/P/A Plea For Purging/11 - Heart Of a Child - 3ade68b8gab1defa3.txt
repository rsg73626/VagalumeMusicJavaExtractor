HEART OF A CHILD

With the heart of a child
My tainted eyes have
Not lost every ounce of innocence
I still fight to hold onto my youth
I won't give into death like you

Kingdom of youthfull minded
Positive but not innocent
We still fight to hold onto our youth
We won't give into death like you

We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing

They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything

With the heart of a child
We will live forever
Children live forever

We won't be mislead
We won't be mislead
We won't be mislead (by broken dreams of wealth)
We won't be mislead

We will live forever
Children live forever
We will live forever
Children live forever

We are not a product of society
We are not a sick, dying breed
For the meek will inherit the earth
As the weak watches riches burn

We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing

They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything

Hallelujah
Children live forever
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
