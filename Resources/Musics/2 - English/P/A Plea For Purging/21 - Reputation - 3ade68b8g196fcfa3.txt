REPUTATION

This story won’t have a happy ending. Happy endings are for stories that are finished. This won’t end quickly. You won’t enjoy this. I’m fed up with who you are. Generic to the sight. Cliche ideals spew from you. You need to think for yourself. Parade around like you own the world. Embrace your ignorance. Cause you will learn. We all will learn. We all will learn. I’m fed up with who you are. Generic to the sight. Cliche ideals spew from you. You need to think for yourself. My little sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. My little sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. My little sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. My little sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re not like sheep. My little sheep. Don’t fool yourself... Parade around like you own the world. Embrace your ignorance. Cause you will learn. We all will learn. We all will learn. I’m fed up with who you are... Generic to the sight... Cliche ideals spew from you... You need to think for yourself... But who are you fooling. Your fake identity will be your grave. This will be your grave. This will be your grave. This will be your grave.
