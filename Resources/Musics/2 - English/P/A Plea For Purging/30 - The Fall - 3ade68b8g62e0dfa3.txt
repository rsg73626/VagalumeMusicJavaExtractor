THE FALL

One foot in front of the other.
Fall in line.
One foot in front of the other.

Since day one this has been damned.
We blindly follow anything that we’re shown.
Open your eyes.
This is a lie.
Open your eyes.
We’re all living a lie.

Maybe we’re the same.
(We’re not the same. We’re not the same.)
No, but I despise you.
(No, I despise you.)
I know I’m nothing like you.
(I’m nothing like you.)

One foot in front of the other.
Fall in line.
One foot in front of the other.

Since day one I knew this was wrong.
I’m no puppet, I dance for no one.
Open my eyes.
Open my eyes.
Open my eyes.
I refuse to live a lie.

Maybe we’re the same.
(We’re not the same. We’re not the same.)
No, but I despise you.
(No, I despise you.)
I know I’m nothing like you.
(I don’t wanna be anything like you.)

I refuse to fall in line.
I refuse to fall in line... fall in line... fall in line.
I refuse to fall in line.

Maybe we’re the same.
(We’re not the same. We’re not the same.)
No, but I despise you.
(No, I despise you.)
I know I’m nothing like you.
(I don’t wanna be anything like you.)
Maybe we’re the same.
(We’re not the same. We’re not the same.)
No, but I despise you.
(No, I despise you.)
I know I’m nothing like you.
(I don’t wanna be anything like you.)

We’re losing our footholds.
We’re losing our faith.
We’re losing our futures.
We’re losing our sanity.
I’m losing my foothold.
I’m losing my sanity.
