GOLDEN BARRIERS

Fame is a lonely world.
Success has its enemies.
Look where it’s gotten us.
Is this what we wanted?
It has nothing for me... nothing... nothing for me.
What can you offer a man that has nothing to lose?
Fame is a lonely world.
Success has its enemies.

I’m sick and tired of looking past the things you do.
I’m sick of sugar-coating everything I say.
Was it to good or evil that I sold my soul.
This is over my head, over your head, over my head anyway.

Life can truly begin when you have nothing to lose.
I have nothing...nothing left to lose....
Life can truly begin when you have nothing to lose.
I have nothing left to lose.

I fear no death and no pain.
I have nothing left to lose.
I’m not scared of you.
I’m not scared of you.
I fear no death and no pain.
I have nothing left to lose.
I’m not scared of you.
I’m not scared of you.

We will not be stopped.
You will not silence me....
We are the new torch runners.
We cannot be stopped.
I fear no death and no pain.
I have nothing left to lose.
I’m not scared of you.
I’m not scared of you.
