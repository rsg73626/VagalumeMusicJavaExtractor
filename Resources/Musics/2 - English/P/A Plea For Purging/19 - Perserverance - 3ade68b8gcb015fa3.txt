PERSERVERANCE

Oh God,
You who are so wise,
where is the joy in my trials?
Weak, i'm tossed about.
You who are so wise,
give me your strength.
Perserverance.

I stand stronger

You do not tempt me.
It is my death that tempts me.
Death disguised.

My sin leads to death.

Mirror, mirror
tell me your lies

Look after look my face is the same.

Oh God from the heavenly lights above,
pull me from these shadows.
Oh God wake me from this dream.
Save me from me from me.

Oh watchman, watchman,
what's left of the night?
