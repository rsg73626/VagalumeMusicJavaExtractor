TRAITOR

Interrupt me at any time but it’s too late to apologize. It took years to build this but only seconds to destroy. My mind was in it. My heart was in it. Then you went and did this. But you said you didn’t. I can’t help but feel it was all my fault. But we both know that’s not true. If you can’t take me at my worst then you don’t deserve my best. They say some things are better left undone. I’d have to agree. So turn and run like you’ve never seen my face before. You’ll never see it again. They say some things are better left undone. I’d have to agree. So turn and run like you’ve never seen my face before. You’ll never see it again. I thought my heart would feel empty. Where your love once was. But now the void is only filled with hate. For the love that there was between us. Lifetime lived in the blink of an eye. But this season seems to last forever. This cold winter’s eating at my bones. You left me for dead, left me for dead, left me for dead, left me for dead. Now I’m leaving you... I can’t see your face... You’re dead to me, you’re dead... It’s time to forgive and forget but I’m still holding onto all this hate. They say some things are better left undone. I’d have to agree. So turn and run like you’ve never seen my face before. You’ll never see it again. They say some things are better left undone. I’d have to agree. So turn and run like you’ve never seen my face before. You’ll never see it again. I thought my heart would feel empty. Where your love once was. Your love is dead... I can’t see your face. You’re dead to me. You’re dead to me, you’re dead to me, you’re dead.
