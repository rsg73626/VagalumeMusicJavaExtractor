PREVARICATOR

Drown me in your lies and your unrepentant selfishness. Blood thirsty and deceitful. We were to be sheep among wolves. Oh but our flesh never tasted so good. You call me your brother. You call me your family. But you lie to my face. Look me in the eye you coward. I ought to put you in the ground. I ought to put you in the ground. You die with your secrets. You die with your secrets. We all die with our secrets. We all die with our secrets. I question your loyalty. Shed your skin. You were never one of us. I question your loyalty. Drink the blood. You were never one of us. I will never trust the hands of men. Never trust again. Will never trust the hands of men. Never trust again... We walk in the same circles. We walk the same streets but I’m not hiding in dark corners. How did you think you could keep this from me? I can’t think of one thing big enough to lie about. That’s small enough not to matter, not to matter. You kept your enemies closer than you kept me. Not cause you’re scared of defeat, but so your lies can’t be seen. You kept your enemies closer than you kept me. Not cause you’re scared of defeat, but so your lies can’t be seen.
