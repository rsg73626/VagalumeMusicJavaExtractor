EYE FOR AN EYE

I've been tolerating your shit for way to long
You're one insult, one comment away from it going
All wrong

I will take back,
Everything you took from me

Now it's all about revenge,
Hate and dedication to being you towards your bitter end

I will take back,
Everything you took from me

So many times, I just gave up
So many times, you would pull me down
Too many times, I let you win
Too many times I handed you the crown.

I will take back,
Everything you took from me
