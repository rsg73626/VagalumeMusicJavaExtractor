CRUCIFIED BY FEAR

You pray to a god that's dead.
You just want to keep the faith.
f**k those things they're pieces of sh*t.
Now face reality.
You think you are the light of your actions.
But you're nothing more that a shadow in our souls.
You think you can save us from fear.
But fear has been putting you on the cross.
Stop lying motherf**ker.
You are f**king dead.
