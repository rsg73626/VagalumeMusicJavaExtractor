BOUC EMISSAIRE

When you've done something that effects me
And the life that I live
The hate in your eyes was all I could see.

Your words ignite my hate
Your actions fuel my rage

For every mistake you've ever made
I've always took the blame
And still the anger in your eyes
Was all I needed to see.

Your words ignite my hate
Your actions fuel my rage

You've got no balls, no claim for actions
You've been through so many times.
I took the blame for you,
But not this time,
Never again.
