SAVIOR

You're not my savior
And you never will be

Blame me, because I never worship your lies
Chanting your hymns to a ghost,
It will never save you

You're not my savior
And you never will be

Can you see that he's slowly
Pulling you in his wrath?
He's sucking the life from your heart
So you can't ever go back

Haunted by your demons
You feel so alone
Don't you feel alone?
