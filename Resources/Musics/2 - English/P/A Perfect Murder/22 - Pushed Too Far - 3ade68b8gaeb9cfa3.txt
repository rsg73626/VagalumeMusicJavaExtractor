PUSHED TOO FAR

Terrorize you for what you did before.
I stomped on everything you said.
The horror of all my fears are now gone.
I'm crushing you.
Pushing you.
I'm crushing you.
Punish you.
Now you have to face my eyes.
Now you have to face my fist.
I'm crushing you.
Pushing you.
I'm crushing you.
Punish you.
I just hope you DIE.
