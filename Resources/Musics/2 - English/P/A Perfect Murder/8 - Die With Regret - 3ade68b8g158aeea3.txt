DIE WITH REGRET

Such an innocent face and a wonderful person.
You took her last breath and now she's missed in this world.
An unforgettable act, the worst possible thing
Playing the role of a god with another human being.

Die with regret, die guilty for what you did.

Who are you to decide, who is to live or who is to die
You'll be the first to die or better yet buried alive.
We will never forget everything that you did
The sentence lies with us, we judge hard and we won't forgive.

Die with regret, die guilty for what you did.

I know she's gonna wait for you in hell!
I know she's gonna save a place for you in hell!
