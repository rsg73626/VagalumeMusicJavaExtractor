POSSESSED

Conditioning you to fear everything,
Everything, even your own life
Whose world are you living in?
What world should you believing in?

Depression and aggression, surrounding you
Oppression and suffocation are consuming you

It's controlling you, it's possessing your mind
It's cutting you down, so down to your spine
The torture is real as my eyes can see
No saving this slave from the violence and crime

Depression and aggression surrounding you
Oppression and suffocation are consuming you

It's controlling youIt's possessing you
Over these atrocities I continue to rise.
