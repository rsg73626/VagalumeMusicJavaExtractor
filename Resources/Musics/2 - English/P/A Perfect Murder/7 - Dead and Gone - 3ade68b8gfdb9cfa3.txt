DEAD AND GONE

Dear drew
You blew our flame away
It passed by so fast
I'm writing this song
Despite knowing how it will end.
I write blood covered words
With tears and a knife in my hands
My world is crumbling down
Hammers nail me to the ground.
I know I'm already dead and gone to you
But this story could not carry on without you.
Saying these three simple words
Once again...I love you
You ruined everything I cared for.
Fuck you.
But now these are my final words
Sincerely, yours
