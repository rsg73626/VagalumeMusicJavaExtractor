THE BURNING CROSS

You have no conceptions of what the word hate really means.
Spreading shit all over.
This world.
With unfounded dogmas.
No (way we'll have it).
You want to purify the world motherfuckers.
Than slit your wrists.
Spreading shit all over.
This world.
With unfounded dogmas.
No (we ain't going to take it!)
