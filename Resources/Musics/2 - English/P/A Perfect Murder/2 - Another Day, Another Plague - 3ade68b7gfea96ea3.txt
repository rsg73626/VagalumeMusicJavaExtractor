ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER PLAGUE

Another day, another plague
I still see the same old shit
Like a never-ending story
Life's passing by in front of my eyes
Everyday I wake up and things never change
It's getting hard to have faith in this world
Everyday I wake up and things never change
It's getting hard to have faith in this world

Another day, another plague
It's like a cancer taking the life out of me
The only hope I had left is slowly dying

Those days, have turned into years
And I haven't gained anything

Everyday I wake up and things never change
It's getting hard to have faith in this world
Everyday I wake up and things never change
It's getting hard to have faith in this world
