JADED JADED

You Think You Are The Next Big Thing
You Look So Cool Now.
You're Acting Like A Superstar
Telling Everyone About Your Bullshit
So Long, And Never Come Back
So Long, And Don't Cross Me Again 

You Can Say That You Grew Up
You Can Say That You're Over This Now
But I Can Tell Say That You're Fucking Lame 

So Long, And Never Come Back
So Long, And Don't Cross Me Again 

Never Cross Me Again 

You Were All About Being "Young Until I Die"
Now You Laugh At Those Days
Because It's So Cool To Be Jaded
So Long, And Never Come Back 

And Now That You Can't Look Me In The Eyes
I See Your Bullshit And All Your Lies 

So Long And Never Come Back
