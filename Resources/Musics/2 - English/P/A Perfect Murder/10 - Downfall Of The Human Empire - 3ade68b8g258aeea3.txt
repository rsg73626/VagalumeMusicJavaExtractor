DOWNFALL OF THE HUMAN EMPIRE

My wounds are bleeding my hate for you.
I'm sick of your destruction's benevolence.
As you kill the earth you kill all of us.
Downfall of the human empire.
I suffer in this dying world.
Destined to burn in the flames of hell.
Warfare killing lives everyday.
Environment's devastation still acts.
The death of your freedom is coming.
Prepare to meet your destiny.
