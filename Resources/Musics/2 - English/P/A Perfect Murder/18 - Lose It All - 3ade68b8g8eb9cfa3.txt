LOSE IT ALL

My wounds are bleeding my hate for you
I'm sick of your fucking plastic smile.
As I bleed you dry
You lose your shallow eyes
As I bleed you dry
You lose that fakes ass smile
Lose it all.
I've suffered for the last time
Now you're destined to burn in the flames of hell
Condemned to burn in the flames of hell.
My hate is killing you piece by piece
The death of your fucking world is coming.
Prepare to meet your destiny
