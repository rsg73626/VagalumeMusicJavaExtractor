JADED

You think you are the next big thing
You look so cool now
You're acting like a superstar
Telling everyone about your bullshit

So long, and never come back
So long, and don't cross me again

You can say that you grew up
You can say that you're over this now
But I can tell that you're fucking lame.

So long, and never come back
So long, and don't cross me again
Never cross me again.

You were all about being "young until I die"
Now you laugh at those days
Because it's so cool to be jaded
So long, and never come back again

And now that you can't look me in the eyes
I see your bullshit and all your lies

So, long and never come back!!!
