NO TRUCE

Known for years the trouble you've been nothing
And you thought we wouldn't have seen anything
Now that the real truth is resurfacing
It isn't your innocence you should be craving

Don't wait for a truce,
The war is on, the war is on

You try so hard to deny
All the mistakes and all the lies
We've heard the bullshit, we know the lies
No excuses can get you off this time.

Don't wait for a truce,
The war is on, the war is on
