UNBROKEN

You discouraged us in so many ways
Everyday was an obstacle, everyday seemed wasted
And yoy kept saying we wouldn't belong

We will remain, unbroken
We Will never stop chasing our dreams
Your efforts are useless
And you'll get what you now never expected

Now your cheap shots fall far from the target,
We learned to roll with the punches and never forget
The life we now live and the life we might have left

We will remain, unbroken
