PROPHET ON A LIE

Spreading your lies
And preaching like a prophet
For all those gone beyond
(For you) I'll never sacrifice my life.
I should be in fear of your judgment
But for now and ever I rise above them.
I won't hear you
Never feel you I don't bare your marks.
I should be in fear of your judgment
But for now and ever I rise above them
