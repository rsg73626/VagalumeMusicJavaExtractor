SLAVE TO THE CLOCK

Get in line and get ready to die,
To lie in slow agony,
It's killing you from the inside.
Wake up and open your eyes,
So you can feel your hell.
Your nightmare is your everyday life,
Time to say goodbye, to a life of self destruction

You're a slave to the clock
And your life is wasting away

You're just a rusty tool
Ready to breakdown in pieces.
You're one of those workhorses
And your condition is constantly getting worse
The pain, the damage is harder and digs deeper
Time to say goodbye, to a life of self-destruction

You're a slave to the clock
And your life is wasting away
