LAST KISS

Tonight the road home.
Feels so long.
So many questions.
Without any answers.
I lost you once again.
Now miss you once again.
This last night together.
Meant nothing to me.
Not anymore.
You just killed me with that last caress.
I even tried to be what you always hoped,
tried to figure out what was wrong, was right.
I still have no answer for this last kiss.
