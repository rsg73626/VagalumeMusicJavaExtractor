SPEAK WITHOUT FAITH

We build this scene with nothing but heart.
Real kids making, it better than it was from the start.
Those who don't feel the efforts put in by those before
Will be the first to be led out of the door.

Act without heart, speak without faith
You should stay away from me

Some people just get into it the wrong way.
It's time to put these people back in their place.
We should fight together for the right things,
Fight to keep what we built

Act without heart, speak without faith
You should stay away from me
