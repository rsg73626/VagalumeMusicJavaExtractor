TIME BOMB

It all started as a game
You said lets fucking try it
Just for fun, just like everyone wlse did
But you got played in your own game

Your life is a timebomb

It happened so quickly,
It took you everything
And now your life is a living hell
Your heart is pumping poison
You lungs can barely breathe
And you're sitting on a timebomb

You got played in your own game

It all started as a game
But the game is over now

And your eyes are shut, forever.
