SLEEPING BEAUTY

Delusional
I believe I can cure it all
For you dear
Coax or trick or drive or
Drag the demons from you
Make it right for you sleeping beauty
Truly thought
I can magically heal you

You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to rescue 

Sleeping beauty

Drunk on ego
Truly thought 
I could make it right
If I kissed you one more time to 
Help you face the nightmare, but you're 
Far too poisoned for me 
Such a fool to think that I can wake you from your slumber 
That I could actually heal you

Sleeping beauty 
Poisoned and hopeless

You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to find a way to comfort you
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
And hiding from some poisoned memory

Poisoned and hopeless 
Sleeping beauty
