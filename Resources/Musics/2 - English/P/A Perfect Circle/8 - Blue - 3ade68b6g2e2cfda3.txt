BLUE

I didn't want to know 
I just didn't want to know 
Best to keep things in the shallow end 
Cause I never quite learned how to swim 

I just didn't want to know 
Didn't want, didn't want, 
Didn't want, didn't want 

Close my eyes just to look at you 
Taken by the seamless vision 
I close my eyes, 
Ignore the smoke, 
Ignore the smoke 

Call it aftermath, she's turning blue 
Such a lovely color for you 
Call it aftermath, she's turning blue 
While I just sit and stare at you 

Because I don't want to know 
I didn't want to know 
I just didn't want to know 
I just didn't want 

Mistook their nods for an approval 
Just ignore the smoke and smile 

Call it aftermath, she's turning blue 
Such a lovely color for you 
Call it aftermath, she's turning blue 
Such a perfect color for your eyes 
Call it aftermath, she's turning blue 
Such a lovely color for you 
Call it aftermath, she's turning blue 
While I just sit and stare at you
