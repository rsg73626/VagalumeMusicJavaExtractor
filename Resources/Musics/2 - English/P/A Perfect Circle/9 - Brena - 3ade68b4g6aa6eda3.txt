BRENA

My reflection wraps and pulls me under healing waters
to be bathed in Brena

Guide me safely in worlds I've never been to
Heal me Heal me My dear Brena

Vulnerable
It's alright

Heal me Heal me My dear Brena

Show me lonely and show me openings
To bring me closer to you My dear Brena

Vulnerable
it's alright

Opening to... heal... Opening to... heal...
Heal.. Heal.. Heal...
