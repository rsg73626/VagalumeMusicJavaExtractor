GIMME, GIMME, GIMME

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
I need some more,
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
Don't ask what for

Sitting here I'm a loaded gun,
Waiting to go off,
I've got nothing to do,
But shoot my mouth off

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
I need some more,
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
Don't ask what for
You know I'm gonna go out,

Get something for my head,
If I keep on doing this,
I'm gonna end up dead

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
I need some more,
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
Don't ask what for

I know the world's got problems,
I've got problems of my own,
Not the kind that can't be solved,
With an atom bomb

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
I need some more,
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
Don't ask what for
