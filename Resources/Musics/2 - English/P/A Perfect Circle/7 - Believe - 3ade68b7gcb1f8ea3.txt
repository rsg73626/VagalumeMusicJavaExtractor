BELIEVE

Deny, the thing that you were, you're alone can you feel it?

Defy the way of the world, trapped in the past will you seal it?

Wake up, wake up from the lie, (are you ready to breath?)
Wake up, wake up from the lie (are you ready to believe?)
Are you ready to breath? Believe. You ready to be received?

Surprise, as keen as you were, you were blind to the feeling, to crush, the fear that you must, live with your feet on the ceiling.

Wake up, wake up from the lie, (are you ready to breath?)
Wake up, wake up from the lie (are you ready to believe?)
Are you ready to breath? Believe. Are you ready to be received?

Learn from all the knowledge and this fear is taking over, and then you learn from all the knowledge and this fear is taking over.

Believe. Are you ready to breath? Believe. Are you ready to beâ€¦ Learn from all of this knowledge and all your fears are taking you over, and then you learn from all of this knowledge and all your fears are taking you over.
