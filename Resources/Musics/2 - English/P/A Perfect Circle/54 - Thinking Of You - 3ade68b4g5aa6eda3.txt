THINKING OF YOU

Lying all alone and restless unable to lose this image
Sleepless, unable to focus on anything but your surrender
Tugging a rhythm to the vision thats in my head
Tugging a beat  to the sight of you lying

So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes
that unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakable sound I know so well

Spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
Spent and sweating with a look on your face like

Sweet Revelation Sweet Surrender,
surrender, surrender, surrender
Tugging a rhythm to the vision thats in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying

So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes
that unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakeable sound I know so well

Spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
Spent and sweating
With a look on your face like

Sweet revelation, sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation, sweet

Thinking of you, thinking of you,
Thinking....

Sweet revelation sweet surrendering
sweet revelation
