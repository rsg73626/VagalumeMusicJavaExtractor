A STRANGER

Cast the calming apple 
Up and over satellites 
To draw out the timid wild one 
To convince you it's alright 
And I listen for the whisper 
Of your sweet insanity while I formulate 
Denials of your affect on me 

You're a stranger 
So what do I care 
You vanish today 
Not the first time I hear 
All the lies 

What am I to do with all this silence 
Shy away, shy away phantom 
Run away terrified child 
Won't you move away you fucking tornado
I'm better off without you
Tearing my will down
