CRY FOR YOU

You know i can't believe you
All the things you say they're not true whoooo
But i fear i can't just leave you
All i feel is that i need you my love

This is all my spirit can take
Any more and i will surely meet decay
Won't you reach out and touch my heart ache
Feel it beating please don't throw it away

I can't believe your careless lies
Your burning eyes pass through me
I never thought our love would die
But how could i, i could not see

Baby girl you know i need you
Can't believe that you would leave me this way
If my pain will not appease you so it please you
I've got nothing to say
I now begin to realize
You're not the girl i once knew
But deep beneath those eyes resides that dying part of
You (of you)
I will cry, cry for you (for you)
I will cry, cry for you

(--?) you shut the moon out as though it were bright
As sun in the day
While we crawl through the dimensions in your head you
Would show me a way

I can't believe your careless lies
Your burning eyes pass through me
I never thought our love would die
But how could i, i could not see
See for you
I will cry, cry for you (for you)
I will cry, cry for you (for you)
I will cry, cry for you (for you)
I will cry, cry for you (for you)
I will cry, cry for you (for you)
