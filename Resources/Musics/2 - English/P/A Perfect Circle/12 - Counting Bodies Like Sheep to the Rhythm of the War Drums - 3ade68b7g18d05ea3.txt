COUNTING BODIES LIKE SHEEP TO THE RHYTHM OF THE WAR DRUMS

Don't fret precious I'm here, 
Step away from the window (2x)
Go back to sleep

Safe from pain and truth and choice 
and other poison devils,
See, they don't give a fuck about you, 
like I do.

I'll be the one to protect you from 
your enemies and all your demons
I'll be the one to protect you from 
A will to survive and a voice of reason
I'll be the one to protect you from 
your enemies and your choices son
They're one in the same, I must isolate you
Isolate and save you from yourself
