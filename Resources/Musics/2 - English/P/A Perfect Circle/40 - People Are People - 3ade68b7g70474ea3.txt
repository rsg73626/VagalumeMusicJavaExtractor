PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE

We're different colors,
And different creeds,
And different people,
Have different needs,
It's obvious you hate me,
Though I've done nothing wrong,
I've never even met you,
What could I have done?

[x2]
People are people so why should it be?
You and I shouldn't get along.
People are people so why should it be?
You should hate me.

You're punching and kicking,
And you're shouting at me,
I'm relying on your common decency,
So far it hasn't surfaced,
But I'm sure it exists,
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fist.

I can't understand,
What makes a man,
Hate another man,
Help me understand,

[x2]
People are people,
So why should it be?,
You and I shouldn't get along,
People are people,
So why should it be,
You Should Hate me

[x3]
I can't understand,
What makes a man,
Hate another man?,
Help me understand,
