OPERA

Listen uh I met this guy and uh you know I don't get down like that but we were together for a while and you know things
didn't work out but I can't be mad with him you know cause we had some moments Yo I'll explain listen

We wrote fairy tales of how we'll live in castles tight like Hansel and Gretal and grow old and settle in a town that we'll
tighten with our marry day we got a love like that like everyday like everyway
I cannot stay at yours tonight we can hold tight love bite and share some soul we can pick and roll lose control and let me
take it like how I let you break it don't forget We can get high on each other insert a time for it through the night and
back into the morning can't crack the habit you see I'm feening I'm needing some more and you got me grinning like it's
money that I'm winning No way is this sinning cause you got me feeling purer than thou show me how you do this thing cause
you got me singing like, Yo, for real....

He had me singing like some kinda opera shit I don't know where we went with it, it was like.......I used to turn to him
and just whisper in his ear cause yo, I made him promises like I'd say ummm

I'll crown you king of this throne if you can take me home like run with no stripes doesn't have to be tonight how's about
early morning I'm talking AM we can beat the dawning or just chill few time barriers can't help the whispers of I do but you
see through my proper test got me making game faces in London we say lacing you making sense this shit's intense I climb
the wall in a frenze cause you move me so I broke my role and got freaky with it You chastise me with my own belt I ain't
gonna lie I felt the universe move you left me singing like Opera like Cleopatra or Madam Butterfly you this shit's so good
it brought tears to my eyes I was like....

I'm telling you man it's no lie I was like..... I just yo, I, I couldn't even igmore parts of me I was like grabbing on him
and We were happy for a minute for true Opera We'd be like yo yo yo

Was that suppossed to happen all that foot tappin' voice breakin' now I'm carving Karma Sutra diagrams with the headboard
ignored the buzzer 4 times got up hard telling lies even surprised myslef with my conniving ways I doved in like he meant
survival like he was christened H20 like he could make the trees grow and the clouds spit snow He laid kisses on my chest
like his name was Zorro got me saying Hell No when he said he had to go I was hiding clothes and play fighting with children
We were clashing Titans till weight we were losing I had Slum Village ablum on repeat we were knockin boots to hip hop
beats I even reached my maximum in my sleep yo he had me singing like.....

Yo, for real I'm not lying listen up It was like.... I'm gonna break it down the truth is I got goose pimples now just
thinking about that shit yo, Just his voice If I could hear his voice right now I'd answer the phone like...... you know
what I mean yo listen if I knew where he was right now I'd find him We split We split ways we went about you know we went
about our business I wanna know if he's making somebody else hit that Opera you know cuz I ain't had nonna that in a
minute it's like....
