BY AND DOWN

Moving in and out of the shadows
It's no easy mission
Holding on to how I picture you
Showing only bits and pieces
Till the tide betrays you
And your empty allocution

Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of humility
Searching your eyes for the saint is an act of futility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of it
Searching your eyes for humility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace
I'm still searching, searching

Showing only bits and pieces
Till the light betrays you
And your empty allocution
Rode the Piper by and down the river
Carcass crippled underneath
The pounding waves of adoration

Pied Piper float on down the river
Bloated carcass, crippled knee
The weight of adoration
Moving in and out of the shadows
It's no easy mission
Holding on to how I picture you
