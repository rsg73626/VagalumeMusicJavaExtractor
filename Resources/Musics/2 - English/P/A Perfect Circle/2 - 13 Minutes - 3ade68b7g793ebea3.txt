13 MINUTES

Its funny when things go wrong,
I get tired of waking
For all the things I've loved before
I'm tired of breaking
Good things are far ahead, yeah
but my patience is shaking
Only 13 minutes left,
but is it worth waiting..

Would you care for me
cause I'm tired
Tired of all this life
Would you care for me
cause I feel like..
I've been cut inside

It's blatant to feel so
wrong
to get hurt by the taking
everything that I've said before
I hesitate saying
I'm crawling fast ahead, yeah
the pace that I'm making
Only 13 minutes left
but it's not worth waiting..

Would you care for me
cause I'm tired
Tired of all this life
Would you care for me
cause I feel like..
I've been cut inside
