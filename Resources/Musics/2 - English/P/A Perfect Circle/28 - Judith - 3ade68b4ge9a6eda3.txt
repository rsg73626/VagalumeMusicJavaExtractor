JUDITH

You're such an inspiration
For the ways that I will never ever choose to be.
Oh, so many ways for me to show you how your
Savior has abandoned you.
Thank (Fuck) your God, your Lord, your Christ.
He did this, took all you had
And left you this way
Still you pray never stray
Never taste of the fruit
You never thought to question why.

It's not like you killed someone.
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side.
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed.
He did it all for you.

Oh, so many ways for me to show you how your
Dogma has abandoned you.
Pray to your Christ, to your God.
Never taste of the fruit, never stray, never break.
Never choke on the lie, even though he's the one
Who did this to you, you never thought to question why.

It's not like you killed someone.
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side.
Talk to Jesus Christ as if he knows the reasons why.
He did it all for you.
