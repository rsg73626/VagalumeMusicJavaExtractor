CHOKE

Writhing in love you swear 
what you feel is real 
Bending your every illusion 
You fake it all too well 
Numbing the mind rest inside 
that hate left unspoken 
Tasting the truth it's shy 
afraid to be broken 

And it's humbling 
This pain you feel inside 
And it's stuttering 
These words that I must try 

Seeing the unheard you know 
that it cannot heal 
Breaking the bonds you swear 
that you swear to feel 
Can you awake from sleep downed 
you allow me to steal 
Gagging on selfish hide 
when you crawl to kneel 

And it's humbling 
This pain you feel inside 
And it's stuttering 
These words that I must try 

And I'm choking on love 
I made you feel
