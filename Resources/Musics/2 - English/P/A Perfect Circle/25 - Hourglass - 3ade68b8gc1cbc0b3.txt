HOURGLASS

Red flag red, all the sentinels are damned
The Tokyo kitty, swallow, rose, and canary
Tick tick tick, do you recognize the sounds
as the grains count down
Trickle down right in front of you?

A little tickle tickle tickle, all your neck hairs prickle
As they barbecue the sentinels
then eat them right in front of you
Hourglass smashed, a billion little pieces
The count down, carry on: Five, four, three, two

Aristocrat breaks down to
Democrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republicrat breaks down to
Aristocrat breaks down to
Democrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republicrat breaks down to
No hope left in the hourglass

Red flag red, all the sentinels are damned

the sounds as the grains count down?
Trickle down right in front of you

Tickle tickle tickle, all your neck hairs prickle
As they barbecue the sentinels
then eat them right in front of you
Hourglass smashed, a million little pieces
They count down, carry on: Five, four, three, two
