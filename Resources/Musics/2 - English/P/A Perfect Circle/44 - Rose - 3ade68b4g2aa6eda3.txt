ROSE

Don't disturb the beast, the temperamental goat, the snail,
While he's feeding on the rose --
Stay frozen, compromise what I will I am
Bend around the wind, silently blown about again
I'm treading so soft and lightly,
Compromising my will I am

I am, I will,
So no longer will I lay down
Play dead
Play your doe in the headlights, locked down and terrified
Your deer in the headlights, shot down and horrified
When push comes to pull, comes to shove, comes to step around
This self-destructive dance that never would have mattered
'Till I rose, I roared aloud,
Here, I will I am

I am, I will,
So no longer will I lay down
Play dead
Play this..
Beat down, gun-shy,  martyr,  pitiful
I rose, and I roared,
I will I am
