I'M SLEEPING IN A SUBMARINE

She’s gone to sea
She’s fightin’ for me
What bravery!

I’m sleeping in a battle ship
I’m sleeping in a submarine
I’m sleeping in a fighter plane
I’m sleeping going down the drain

All hands on deck!

The radio adresss
What a mess!

A cage is a cage
Is a cage, is a cage!
