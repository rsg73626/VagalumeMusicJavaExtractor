WHAT'S GOING ON

Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on

Father, father
Everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
