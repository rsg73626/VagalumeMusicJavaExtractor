DIARY OF A MADMAN/LOVESONG

Screaming at the window
Watch me die another day
Hopeless situation endless price I have to pay

Diary of a madman
Walk the line again today
Entries of confusion
Dear diary I'm here to stay

Sanity now it's beyond me, I Will always love you,
however long i stay, i will always love you, 
whatever words i say, i will always love you 
Theres no choice

whenever i'm alone with you 
you make me feel like i am home again

Voices in the darkness
Scream away my mental health
Can I ask a question
To help me save me from myself

Sanity now it's beyond me, I Will always love you,
however long i stay, i will always love you, 
whatever words i say, i will always love you 
Theres no choice
