PASSIVE

A Perfect Circle - Passive

"Dead as dead can be," my doctor tells me,
But I just can't believe him,
Ever the optimistic one, 
I'm sure of your ability 
To become my perfect enemy

Wake up 
and face me
Don't play dead
Cause maybe 
Someday 
I will walk away, and say
"You disappoint me, 
Maybe you're better off this way"

Leaning over you here 
Cold and catatonic,
I catch a brief reflection 
Of what you could and might have been,
It's your right and your ability
 To become my perfect enemy

Wake up 
and face me,
Don't play dead 
Cause maybe 
Someday 
 I' ll walk away and say
"You disappoint me, 
Maybe you're better off this way"

Maybe you better off this way (4x)
You better off this (2x)

Wake up 
and face me,
Don't play dead 
Cause maybe 
Someday 
 I' ll walk away and say
"You fucking disappoint me, 
Maybe you're better off this way"

Go ahead and play dead,
 I know that you can hear this,
Go ahead and play dead, 
Why can't you turn and face me? (4x)
You fucking disappoint me,

Passive aggressive bullshit
