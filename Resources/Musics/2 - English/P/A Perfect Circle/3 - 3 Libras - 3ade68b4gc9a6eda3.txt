Threw you the obvious
And you flew with it on your back,
A name in your recollection,
Down among a million same.

Difficult not to feel a little bit
Disappointed and passed over
When I look right through
To see you naked but oblivious
And you don't see me.

But I threw you the obvious
Just to see if there's more behind the
Eyes of a fallen angel,
Eyes of a tragedy.

Here I am expecting just a little bit
too much from the wounded.

But I see, see through it all,
See through and see you.

'Cause I threw you the obvious
To see what occurs behind the
Eyes of a fallen angel,
Eyes of a tragedy.
Oh well, oh well, apparently nothing.
Apparently nothing at all.

You don't, you don't, you don't see me.
You don't, you don't, you don't see me.
You don't, you don't, you don't see me.
You don't, you don't, you don't see me.
You don't see me.
You don't, you don't, you don't see me at all.
