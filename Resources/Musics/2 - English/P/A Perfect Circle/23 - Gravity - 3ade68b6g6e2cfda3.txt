GRAVITY

Lost again 
Broken and weary 
Unable to find my way 
Tail in hand 
Dizzy and clearly unable to 
Just let this go 

I am surrendering to the gravity and the unknown 
Catch me heal me lift me back up to the sun 
I choose to live 

I fell again 
Like a baby unable to stand on my own 
Tail in hand 
Dizzy and clearly unable to just let this go 
High and surrendering to the gravity and the unknown 
Catch me heal me lift me back up to the sun 
I choose to live, I choose to live, I choose to live 

Catch me heal me lift me back up to the sun 
Help me survive the bottom 

Calm these hands before they 
Snare another pill and 
Drive another nail down another 
Meaty hole please release me 

I am surrendering to the gravity and the unknown 
Catch me heal me lift me back up to the sun 
I choose to live, I choose to live
