MAGDALENA

overcome by your moving temple
overcome by this holiest of altars
so pure, so rare
to witness such a earthly goddess

i lost my self control
beyond compelled to throw this dollar down
before your holiest of altars

i'll sell my soul, my self esteem
a dollar at a time for one chance, one kiss
one taste of you my magdalena

i've beared witness to this place, this prayer, so long forgotten
so pure, so rare, to witness such a lovely goddess

and i'd sell my soul, my self-esteem
a dollar at a time for one chance, one kiss,
one taste of you my black madonna


i'll sell my soul, my self-esteem
a dollar at a time

for one taste, one taste
one taste of you my magdalena
