FREEDOM OF CHOICE

We're victims of sedition on the open sea.
No one ever said life was free.
Sink, swim, go down with the ship.
Just use your freedom of choice.

I'll say it again in the land of the free
Use your freedom of choice, freedom of choice.

In ancient Rome
There was a pawn
Who followed along
And watched it fall
He cast a stone
He felt secure
He felt that he would never be heard.

Freedom of choice
It's what you've got
Freedom of choice

You're given a voice
You don't want it
Seems to be the rule of thumb
Don't be tricked by waht you see
You've got two ways to go

I'll say it again in the land of the free:
Use your freedom of choice, freedom of choice.

Freedom of choice
It's what you've got
Freedom of choice...

In ancient Rome
There was a pawn
Who followed along
And watched it fall
He cast a stone
He felt secure
He felt that his voice would never be heard.

Freedom of choice
It's what you've got
Freedom from choice
It's what you want.

Freedom of choice -
It's what you've got.
Freedom from choice.
It's what you want.

Freedom from choice
It's what you want.
Freedom from choice.
