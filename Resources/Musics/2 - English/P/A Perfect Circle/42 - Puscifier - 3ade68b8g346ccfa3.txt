PUSCIFIER

Don't be aroused
By my confession
Unless you don't give a good god damn about redemption
I know . Christ is coming
So am I
And you would too if this sexy devil caught your eye
She'll suck you dry
And still you cry
To be back in her bosom
To do it again
She'll make you weak
And moan and cry
To be back in her bosom
To do it again 

Pray
Till I go blind
Pray
cuz nobody ever survives
I'm praying to stay alive just to die a little longer
Saviors and saints and devils and demons alike
She'll eat you alive 

Jesus has risen
Its no surprise
Even he would martyr his momma to right to hell between those thighs
The pressure is building
At the base of my spine
If I gotta sin to see her again
Then I'm gonna LIE AND LIE AND LIE
She'll make you cry 

I'll sell my soul
To be back in your bosom
Gladly now please suck me dry
And still you cry
To be back in her bosom
Do it again 

Pray
Till I go blind
Pray
Cuz nobody ever survives
I'm praying to stay alive just to die a little longer
Saviors and saints and devils and demons alike
She'll eat you alive 

The pulse has been rising
My temples are pounding
The pressure is so overwhelming
I'm building
I'm standing here fretting
Ready to blow 

WHAT IS SHE WAITING FOR? 

Pray till I go blind
Pray for no one ever survives
Pray to stay alive just to die a little longer
Saviors and saints and devils and demons alike
She'll eat you alive
