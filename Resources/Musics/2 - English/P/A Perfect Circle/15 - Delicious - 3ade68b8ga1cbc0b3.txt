DELICIOUS

How inconvenient and unexpected and harrowing for you
As consequences tend to be
For the rest of us so delicious to witness your dread
Poetic justice consummate

Not unlike you to heedlessly
Hoist away your smug grenade
Arrogant and insolent
You don't give a damn
Collateral be damned

Not unlike you to hoist away
Hoist away your smug grenade
Choice and bed be made
Good night, sleep tight

So delicious
For the rest of us to witness your dread
Poetic justice consummate

Not unlike you to heedlessly
Hoist my [?] petard
Wrong side of history
You don't give a damn
Collateral be damned

Not unlike you to hoist away
Hoist away your smug grenade
Choice and bed be made
Good night, sleep tight
