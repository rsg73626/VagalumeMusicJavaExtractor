ARE YOU AFRAID TO DIE

Are you a stranger to God
Carried away with your pride
Tell me sinner
Do you ever stop and think
Are you afraid to die

Are you afraid
Are you unsaved
Are you afraid to die

Call on Him while he is near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek Him 
While He stile may be found
Are you afraid to die

Are you afraid
Are you unsaved
Are you afraid to die

Are you too wicked to cry
Would you to Gods’ bosom fly
Soon He’s comin’ 
Like a theif in the night
Are you afraid to die

Are you afraid
Are you unsaved
Are you afraid to die

Are you afraid
Are you unsaved
Are you afraid to die
