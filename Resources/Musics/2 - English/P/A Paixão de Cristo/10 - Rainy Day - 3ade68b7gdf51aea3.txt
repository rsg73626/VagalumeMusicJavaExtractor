RAINY DAY

On a rainy day
I feel like I can change the world
Cause somehow I know that it's all gonna be alright
And on a rainy day
I can feel my heart beating
And I can taste the tears falling from the sky

On a rainy day
(won't You come and save the world?)
On a rainy day
(I know You're looking down on me)

Love
It keeps us hanging on
Even when all hope is gone
I believe that Your love rains down on me
Faith
It carries us away
It takes us to a place
Far above this world
And I can see you in the clouds
On a rainy day

On a rainy day
I feel like I'm in tune
And I can clearly see how much I have to lose
And on a rainy day
I feel like I am free
Cause I know You did it all to rescue me

On a rainy day
(won't You come and save the world?)
On a rainy day
(I know You're looking down on me)

Love
It keeps us hanging on
Even when all hope is gone
I believe that Your love rains down on me
Faith
It carries us away
It takes us to a place
Far above this world
And I can see you in the clouds
On a rainy day

Won't You come and save the world?
Won't You come and save the world?
Won't You come and save the world for You and me?
Won't You come and save the world?
Won't You come and save the world?
Won't You come and save the world for You and me?

Love
It keeps us hanging on
Even when all hope is gone
I believe that Your love rains down on me
Faith
It carries us away
It takes us to a place
Far above this world
And I can see you in the clouds, yeah
Like a rainbow shining down
On a rainy day
Yeah, on a rainy day
On a rainy day
(Won't You come and save the world?)
