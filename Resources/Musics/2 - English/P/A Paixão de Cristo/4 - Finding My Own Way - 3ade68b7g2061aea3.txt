FINDING MY OWN WAY

Looking back on memories
Thinking how things used to be
Take me in, or was it simple then?

Will someone tell me, how life should be
Understand me, but let me be me

I'm just finding my own way, in my
Own sweet time
If I'm making a mistake at least it's mine
If I travel down a different road, to the 
One that you would take
I'm just finding my own way

If you ever see me cry 
Don't you worry I'll be fine
I know you only want what's best for me

It may be a long way home
But the path I take's my own
I'm not waiting for my destiny

Will someone hold me, when I'm lonely
Understand me, let me be me?

And if you found me all alone
Would you lend a helping hand?
And all I need from you my friend is
For you to understand
And if you would be my comforter
Someone to love
Then You'd help me find my way
(help me find my way)
