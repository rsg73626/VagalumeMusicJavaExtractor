THE EMPIRE

Sink your teeth into me,
Bite so hard it bleeds, I need some answers more than ever, please!

We are fallen angels with no place to go we are fallen angels looking for a home

You are dead, you're alive, but why? 
You're the empire, the rebellion, but why?
Look at your hands, holding them tight to your chest!
Look at your hands, what have they done to the wrists?

Reach your head into me stir up bitter memories,
Steal my dreams while I'm asleep, please!

We are fallen angels with no place to go we are fallen angels looking for a home

You are dead, you're alive, but why? 
You're the empire, the rebellion, but why?
Just, look at your hands, holding them tight to your chest!
Look at your hands, what have they done to the wrists?

My head turned with a doorknob, as you walked in the room, as you walked in the room
My head turned with a doorknob, as you walked in the room, as you walked in the room

You are dead, you're alive, but why? 
You're the empire, the rebellion, but why?
You are dead, you're alive, but why? 
You're the empire, the rebellion, but why?
