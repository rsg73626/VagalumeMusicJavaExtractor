SERENADE FOR SPIDERS

We crawl on stage 
Ready to explode
We grow so strong 
But not enough of us

It's the smile 
On her face
As she cuts 
To the chase
It's the world 
It's the world 
We create
It's the truth 
In your eyes
As you hide 
In disguise
It's the end 
It's the end
It's the start

We drop 
And dance around 
At your feet
Poised 
And positioned 
Run and hide
Colide

It's the past 
Playing on
An it's only begun
It's the world
It's the world
Devestete
It's chaos 
Mixed with greed
As we water 
Our seed
It's the start 
It's the start 
It's the end

Run
Run
Save yourself now
Run 
Run
Save yourself down

You'll never break me
You'll never take me
You'll neve bring us 
Down, down, down

You'll never hate me 
You'll never rate me
You'll never bring me 
Down, down, down
