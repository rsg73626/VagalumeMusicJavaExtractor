I THUMB WRESTLED A WRESTLER AND WON

For the longest time I've hoped and prayed,
It wasn't for nothing
Don't waste your life away,
Cause you're part of something

Shadowed in a place,
Attempts to cover up the multitude of faces
You hide behind
Where will you be
Where will you be when the angels sing?

Open your eyes and learn to love
Open your eyes and learn to love
Open your eyes and learn to love
Open your eyes and learn to love

Where will you be
Where will you be when the angels sing?
Where will you be
Where will you be when the angels sing?
Where will you be
Where will you be when the angels sing?

Lost inside, when you're standing alone in the dark
So cling tight there's nothing left to hide.
Let it all go, just let it all go
Lost inside, when you're standing alone in the dark
So cling tight there's nothing left to hide.
Let it all go, just let it all go
Lost inside, when you're standing alone in the dark
So cling tight there's nothing left to hide.
Oh my god just let it all go
So cling tight cause there's nothing left to hide,
So tell me now where will you be?

Where will you be when the angels sing?
Where will you be
Where will you be when the angels sing?
Where will you be
Where will you be when the angels sing?

Don't waste your life away,
Cause your reign of dissipation is over
