WE'RE BRINGING XANGA BACK

The very presence of you
The very presence of you
Is ever so frightening
It's ever so frightening
You've done nothing but give me
Give hell for wanting this
For wanting this
You know it's true

Everybody get down so easily
You get under my skin
You rip me to shreds
So easily you get under my skin
You rip me to shreds until there's nothing left
There's nothing left
You rip me to shreds till there's nothing left

Now I see the truth behind this breakup
And all this time it was you all along
You truly have some demons
And your heart is slowly corroding away

Is corroding away
And your heart is slowly corroding away
Is slowly corroding away
Is slowly corroding away
It's corroding away

Sooner or later
Sooner or later
There will be nothing left
There will be nothing left
