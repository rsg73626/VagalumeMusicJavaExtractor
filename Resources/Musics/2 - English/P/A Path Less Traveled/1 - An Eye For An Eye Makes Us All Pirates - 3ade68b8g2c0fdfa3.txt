AN EYE FOR AN EYE MAKES US ALL PIRATES

I feel so sick
This isn't me
What am I doing here

In a sense how the hell can they be right
In a way they're wrong we know despite
We play the parts as if they know us better than we know ourselves

Oh I never thought that I would see the day
No I never thought that I would see the day
(I thought we'd know ourselves)
No I never though so why don't you just step up
Step up and be the man you're meant to be

Truth in the pilot
Send me a rescue save me from myself
Step up and be the man you're meant to be
From myself
Step up and be the man you're meant to be
Send me a rescue save me from myself
(me from myself)

We are, we are the biggest loser in your eyes
So won't you help us
Won't you help us kids
Won't you help us burn out the sky
I promised myself that I would never follow in your footsteps

We are, we are the biggest loser in your eyes
So won't you help us
Won't you help us kids
Won't you help us burn out the sky

Truth in the pilot
Send me a rescue save me from myself
Truth in the pilot
Send me a rescue save me from myself
(from myself)
Truth in the pilot
Send me a rescue save me from myself

Oh I never thought that I would see the day
No I never thought that I would see the day
I thought we'd know ourselves
