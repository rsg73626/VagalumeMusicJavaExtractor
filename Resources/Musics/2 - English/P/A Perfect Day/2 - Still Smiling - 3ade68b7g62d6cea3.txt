STILL SMILING

A life without happiness
Some people means dying
And when my train derails off its tracks
I'd rather be there than be flyin'
But it's just one of those things that tragedy brings
That somehow makes me smile

CHORUS:
Well it's rainin' in the hall
The sky's about to fall
Everything's all wrong but I'm still smiling
My best friend's out of work
My boyfriend's such a jerk
It makes me want to cry but I'm still smiling
When it's all over everything

I think you need a remedy
Looks like you're walking on a wire
Well someone's pain is another's comedy
Someone else's water feels like fire
We're all kids just having fun
So stop me if you've heard this one

CHORUS

I see smiling everywhere
In the faces of the old man
I hear laughter in the children
And it's our world of swirling contradictions
Maybe we won't get them all

But it's raining in the hall
The sky's about to fall
Everything's all wrong but I'm still smiling
My best friend's out of work
My boyfriend's still a jerk
Makes me want to cry but I'm still smiling

It's cloudy in my head
I can't get out of bed
The radio is dead but I'm receiving
Messages in code
But danger overloads
And my sister's far away but I'm surviving
When it all over everything
I've run out of words to say
I'm still smiling
