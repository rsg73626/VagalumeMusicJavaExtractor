COULDN'T YOU TRY

I’m on the 99, driving just to stay alive
I’ve packed all my things
And I’m heading to my mother’s
To stay the night

Thoughts are running through my head
I’d rather be alone or dead
You’re making moves on the neighbour
I think she’s a traitor
But go ahead

You say, she didn’t like it anyway

Well I don’t want to leave you like I should
I wouldn’t want to change you if I could
I know it’s never easy being good
But couldn’t you try?
Couldn’t you try?

I can’t explain
Why I think I need to stay
I’m a fanatic nostalgic romantic
And I’m afraid to fail

Maybe I need therapy?

CHORUS

You said dreams would never die
So what are you trying to imply?
A simple strategy to health
Is moving on with someone else

CHORUS
