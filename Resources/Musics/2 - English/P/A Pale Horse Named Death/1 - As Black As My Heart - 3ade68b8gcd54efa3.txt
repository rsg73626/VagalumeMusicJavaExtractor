AS BLACK AS MY HEART

Crumbled up and falling down,
My world is burning to the ground,
And left with a hollow soul nothing left to save,
Put me back in my grave,

Nothing as black as my heart.

Let myself drift on and on,
Into remission my heart has gone,
And withering and burning away,
With my blood and bones I lay,

Nothing as black as my heart.

Now that is said and done,
I burn myself and I feel numb,
And I wake up I see a dead sky,
I bury myself with all of your lies,

Nothing as black as my heart.
