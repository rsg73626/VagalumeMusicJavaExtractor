DEVIL IN THE CLOSET

Every night I run for my bed and hiding under the covers
I need to have my night light on 
and my mommy please don't forget it
Can you make sure the close is closed 
and turn all the clowns around
They come to life in the middle of the night
When the devil comes out of my closet

My nightmares become real,
Devil in the closet lives

3:03 Am, and a floating bed, the door knob turns and 
I feel my dread
The smell of sulfur and burning flesh
You reach out for my shaking hand
Telling me son, I am the fallen angel of your heaven
Collecting children and taking their souls is what I do for a living

My nightmares become real,
Devil in the closet lives
My nightmares become real,
Devil in the closet lives

Everynight I say the lords prayer
But it seems like its getting me nowhere
Can't sleep cause I pissed my bed
I'm terrified of what's ahead
Screaming out for my mom and dad
{lease help me I'm going to hell
If I wake up don't be surprised
I'll have another scar on my broken soul

My nightmares become real,
Devil in the closet lives
My nightmares become real,
Devil inside lives
Devil inside of me
