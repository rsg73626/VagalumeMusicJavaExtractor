MEET THE WOLF

Hey there riding hood
Won't you please meet the wolf
Would let me come inside
Let me under, under the covers
Let me come between your thighs

I know when you squirm like a little girl
I know your addicted

Hey there riding hood
Won't you please meet the wolf
I swear I'll make you feel all right
Make your flowers bloom
Make your honey flow
Be your black dog scratching at your door

I know when you squirm like a little girl
I know your addicted
I know when you squirm like a little girl
I know your addicted

Hey there riding hood
Won't you please meet the wolf
Would you like laying with the devil
Even though just a beginner
Turn you into a sinner
Be your lover forever and ever

I know when you squirm like a little girl
I know your addicted
I know when you squirm like a little girl
I know your addicted
