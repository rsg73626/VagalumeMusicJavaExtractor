BATH IN MY BLOOD (SCHIZOPHRENIA IN ME)

I've got these problems
Within myself
I've got these issues
Inside my fucking head

I'm about to lose my mind
I feel like I'm gonna fucking explode
I'm about to bath in my blood
Schizophrenia in my is taking control

I've got these demons
I can't get out
There's two of me inside
Breaking the shame and I'm going down

I'm about to lose my mind
I feel like I'm gonna fucking explode
I'm about to bath in my blood
Schizophrenia in my is taking control

Everytime I see myself I see a another man that I wanna kill

I've got these scares
And I've got these arms

I'm about to lose my mind
I feel like I'm gonna fucking explode
I'm about to bath in my blood
Schizophrenia in my is taking control

Everytime I see myself I see a another man that I wanna kill
