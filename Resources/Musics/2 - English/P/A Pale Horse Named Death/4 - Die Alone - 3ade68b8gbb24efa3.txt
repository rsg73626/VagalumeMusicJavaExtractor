DIE ALONE

Sometimes you wake up and your world is swallowed up
Sometimes your world changes overnight
Sometimes the ones you love betray you
Sometimes you find yourself all alone

My life has fallen apart so many times I lost count
So many people — now they are all lost
One thing is guaranteed you always die alone

Sometimes you want to put a gun to your head
Sometimes you want to pull the trigger, now you’re dead
Sometimes we cry ourselves to sleep
Sometimes you find yourself all alone

My life has fallen apart so many times I lost count
So many people — now they are all lost
One thing is guaranteed you always die alone

Nightmares become real inside my head, I dream of my death
Nightmares become real inside my head, I dream of my death

My life has fallen apart so many times I lost count
So many people — now they are all lost
One thing is guaranteed you always die alone
