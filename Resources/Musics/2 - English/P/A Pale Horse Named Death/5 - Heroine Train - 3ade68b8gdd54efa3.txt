HEROINE TRAIN

Living here in a park in a cardboard box
And I got a can of cat food
All these squirrels and pigeons are my friends
And I got a date this Friday night with a homeless girl
She says she could get the best shit around
All we gotta do is go downtown

I'm riding the heroin train
I'm riding my broken dream
Can't you see the tracks on my veins
I'm riding the heroin train

Disconnected with my friends and family
I never thought that I would need them
I know I gotta get another fucking quick fix
There's my girlfriends sucking some ones else dick
All I need is to his another spot
Follow the tracks all the way to my black heart

I'm riding the heroin train
I'm riding my broken dream

I never thought I would end up to be a fucking junky
I never thought I would end up to be a fucking

Laying here on a gurby facing the sky
An overdose call I suicide
I tapped the vein for one last time
Life really never had a reason or a rhyme
My homeless bitch is crying over me
All I know the needle set me free

I'm riding the heroin train
I'm riding my broken dream
Can't you see the tracks on my veins
I'm riding the heroin train

I never thought I would end up to be a fucking junky
I never thought I would end dead as a junky
