EQUILIBRIUM

I can feel it now
There's a fire growing within my very chest
Slowly it begins to spread and inside I know
That this is all that I will feel
This is all that I can see
There is a darkness inside of me
For where there torment there is hate

Where there is love there is also pain
I have been clawing at these walls to try and make an escape
Am I insane or the only one who truly sees
What has now come to pass
And what is still to be?

For years these visions and images
Have been in my nightmares
But now I see them as a guide as I remain
Vigilant
My pulse is quickening
As I see my entire life flickering
Hold my heart in your hands and feel it beat

As my body convulses and my world begins to shake
I won't call these white walls a home anymore
I'll rip the ceiling from the rafters
I'll burn this prison down
The visions are flooding in
Now they are all that I see
You can't tell me different

There is nothing you can do
To save me now
There is a cancer
That is consuming
My, entire body
And should my visions start to shake
Will I remain
All I was born to be

You can't
Save me
Clearly
I am barely alive
It seems my body harbours the darkness within me
I've let it fester and grow
I have given fear all control
