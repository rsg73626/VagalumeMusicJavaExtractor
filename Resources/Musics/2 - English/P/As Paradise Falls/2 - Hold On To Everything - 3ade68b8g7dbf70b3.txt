HOLD ON TO EVERYTHING

Oh hell
Save me from myself
My selfish home won't love me
It's history, oh there has to be
A hell for me
Save me from myself
You will never live this down
I never thought I'd hear a fucking sound
Never thought I'd see the day the tables turn around

This is not
A request
This is her
At her best
This is hope
This is revenge

But now the systems opposed
By the unreliable light
There's no time in this place
There's no feeling in his face
So I'll shout this fucking loud
And I'll sing this crystal clear
I'm only a man, that you fucking fear

Water won't save me
Oh hell
Save me from myself
My selfish home won't love me
It's history, oh there has to be
A hell for me

This is not
A request
This is her
At her best
This is hope
This is revenge
Save me from myself
And now we need the time to grow
Water won't save me

Oh hell
Save me from myself
My selfish home won't love me
It's history, oh there has to be
A hell for me
Stop playing his games
When you only want someone to blame

Your all that you want when your all that he fucking needs
Hold on to everything you thought
You know that someday you'll get caught
Not resting
Now won't you take me back
