A PREDATORS PORTRAIT

A lesson in democracy, I will never never be, A servant of a moral standard, a rebel soul 
for the free, I scream and I burn, I deny what I've learned, Can't fight what's inside, on 
this blasphemous ride, Here I stand! 

Chorus 
Cause he will remain, will remain the same, he's a part of the game, and he will remain 

As i cry for more, The angels burn their core, Let the evil saints have their way, When I'm 
heading for oblivion, Acheiving my goals in every way, In malicious ways I hail the insane, 
Nevertheless my broken promises, I scream and I burn, I deny what i've learned, Can't fight 
what's inside, on this blasphemous ride, Here i fall! 

Chorus 

Now, take a look at the predator's portrait 
Cause these walls are closing in! 

Now, take a look at the predator's portrait 
Cause these walls come tumbling down 

Come watch me bleed one more time! No substitute left to find! All that I hear is what I 
preach! A mighty soul is what i keep! 

I step on the face who's dragging me down, Fed up with the precious talk, Like a sinner 
revealing himself again, Now he's down and out, and ready to strike, he's ready to strike, 
he's ready to strike, to clear his very inside 

Chorus
