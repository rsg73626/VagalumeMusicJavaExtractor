FINAL FATAL FORCE

Forevermore, fucked, strapped to the floor, Headlong while i'm pissing on your floor, 
Nameless, clueless a brick in the game, Soon to be removed from the face of the earth, Is 
this a human feast? I was in slumber... now! Am i to be released? Way down in my electric 
pit, Where all you gimps reign supreme, Where i by your strings are dangling, Twinkle, 
twinkle, dangling tip, tap, toe, Is this a human feast? I was in slumber... now! Am I to 
be released? At least I had a hunger for more! 

Chorus 
Final, Fatal, Fatal force - feed the flame once more 
Final, Fatal, Fatal force - to get rid of yourself 

This final verdict with a diabolical view, Can I ever be free from what is pulling me 
through, Narcissistic, pure electric the the savior incarnated, Is this a human feast? I 
was in slumber.. now! Am i to be released? At least I had a hunger for more! 

Chorus 

So you say I'm just a wicked soul, well watch me operate!! 

So you see me coming back for more, You trace my steps like a dog, Nameless, clueless a 
brick in the game, Soon to be removed from the face of the earth, Is this a human feast? 
I was in slumber... now! Am i to be released? At least I had a hunger for more! (repeat)
