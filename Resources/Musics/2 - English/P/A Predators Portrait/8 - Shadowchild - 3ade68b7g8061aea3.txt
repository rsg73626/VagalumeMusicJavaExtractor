SHADOWCHILD

I lick the surface of a freedom ride, Under a hammering light.. I scream! 
Let's roll the dice of the future, burning in my hand, I've built destruction upon the 
velvet skies, Maybe I'm strong, Maybe I'm wrong 

Chorus 
Lead us, Shadowchild - soiled by your faith in disguise 
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes 

I'm raising hell, a magic spell, Pain and pleasure together as one, I will recall, I will 
recall, When I'm down the stairs.. I split human cries, I can feel when they lie, My sun 
being one with the.. universe, Hear my call 

Chorus 

Creating my crown from the millions of lights, I'm abused beyond recognition, Pre-millenium 
futuristic, I predict you all to live under an individual sun, We're all out collecting 
our senses and run.. 

Chorus 
Lead us, Shadowchild - soiled by your faith in disguise 
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes 
Lead us, Shadowchild - the truth's lying far from your life 
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes
