THE ANALYST

Straight forward on the path of life, Who makes you choose that way, Is it a crime to give 
it all up, To leave it all behind, 
Oh, this is all so crystal clear, Going on in shallow blindness, To watch the madmen 
sort things out, No time to spill, Isn't it such a thrill? By self deception I am bound 
to take it seriously, I'm way beyond, I've put myself in a such horrible way to go 

Chorus 
I think you just made a big mistake.. This is just a fake cause I am, Guilty by association 
Sinnger of mankind, Im faced to build my life upon this hidden path I just can't find 

Well.. is this all so crystal cler? Sometimes it seems like time stands still, Demolish 
myself at free will, Can you watch me burn as the sun goes down and my life is so 
overturned, Can I identify myself with the judgement that I'm facing here, Can't deny, 
won't deny that I'm level with the ground by fear 

Chorus 

Punished and banished I kill the ways of life, You predict and restrict my views in the 
hands of time 

Chorus 

You wear the face of a desperate man displacing his fatal actions, Refuse to recall his 
miserable times of stupid and naive attractions, Going on in shallow blindness, To watch 
the madmen sort things out, No time to spill, Isn't it such a mother fucking thrill? By 
self - deception I am bound to take it seriously, I'm way beyond, I've put myself in such 
a horrible way to go 

Chorus 
I think you just made a big mistake... this conversation's over, The analyst may have won 
this case of discrimination and nothing but lies, This fallen era makes me wonder, Is it 
worth it when your dignity dies?
