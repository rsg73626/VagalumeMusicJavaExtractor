NEUROTICA RAMPAGE

Neurotica you player and daughter of mine, Don't you think i know what's all behind I suck 
on your evil punches that my grants soul tumble and roll, You give me strength to break my 
chains, Demonic assaults is all the remains - raising hell within my veins, claim it's 
right to play those games, you're making me repeat myself again - bury the hatchet, light 
my torch, A true believer, a deadly force, you're making my sore eyes live again, The 
wrath of my demon is all I can give back to you, No use for solitude it's better to be 
burned, and not to leam that your master will return, raising hell within my veins, claim 
it's right to play those games, you're making me repeat myself again - bury the hatchet, 
light my torch, A true believer, a deadly force, you're making my sore eyes live again 

Chorus 
Hear! Hear them say it's so clear, What's behind and so near 
Hear them say it's so clear.., that you're one of them 

Look at the inside and tell me that everything there is so sane, You're so affective and 
only got your roots to blame, You give me strength to break my chains,Demonic assaults 
is all the remains - raising hell within my veins, claim it's right to play those games, 
you're making me repeat myself again - bury the hatchet, light my torch, A true believer, 
a deadly force, you're making my sore eyes live again, 

Chorus 

You give me strength, to break my chains, Demonic assaults, is all that remains 

Chorus
