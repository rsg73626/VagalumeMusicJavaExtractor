GRAND FAILURE ANTHEM

Look at the pale face in the sky, It seems so ravaged inside the sense of rage is burning 
my eyes, burning in my eyes, burning to deny, I'm a part of a fallen machine, Which 
reflects my life of misery - Please guide my way through fallen galaxies, Grand failure 
anthem - You'll never see what you've become, we want to get some well - earned respect 
before we choke, Well, there isn't anything that will kill our lust, our lust for power, 
They say, "may you get an hour in heaven before the devil knows you're dead!" Grand failure 
anthem - You'll never see what you've become, we want to get some well - earned respect 
cause we have.. Failed! Failed! Failed! Failed! Ripped another spine til' the end of time, 
Failed! Failed! Failed! Failed! We're being flushed down the drain 

Chorus 
And the one you hate, will suddenly be yourself, and it's all too late.... 

Anything, anything that will make my conscience clean, Is there anyone out there, who can 
restore what we have destroyed? Grand failure anthem - You'll never see what you've 
become, We'll never ever get some, well earned respect cause we have....Failed! Failed! 
Failed! Failed! Ripped another spine til' the end of time, Failed! Failed! Failed! Failed! 
We're being flushed down the drain 

Chorus 

Disruptive and bound to kill itself, The face of earth will turn, When you're crawling to 
the cross, And your inner thoughts reveal themselves, Grand failure anthem - You'll never 
see what you've become, We'll never ever get some, well earned respect cause we 
have....Failed! Failed! Failed! Failed! Ripped another spine til' the end of time, 
Failed! Failed! Failed! Failed! We're being flushed down the drain
