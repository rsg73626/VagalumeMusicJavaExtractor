BASTARD CHAIN

Searching for power, who is to blame? You weak little bastard - bound to symbols of pain, 
Hiding in shadows, a pungent smell, You haven't decided your own fate cause your story of 
life is too bitter to tell, Your dying eyes with a coward's reflection, Heading for the 
true direction, forward to die! 

Chorus 
Bastard Chain, with souls so lame, the bastard's chain 
Bastard Chain, with souls so lame, A bastard's chain 

So you say your mind belongs to them? - Turned upside down again, and again, 
Feel ashame, feel ashame, yourself to blame, yourself to blame - Only yourself... 
Only yourself you can blame! Only yourself you can blame! 

Chorus 

Helpless, you will devour, everything that comes before your eyes, Citizens of restless 
power, never let your scorn rule your fate... Your fate!.. always dragging you down, to 
the ground, a disgrace, a disgrace, your "master race", your "master race" - only 
yourself... only yourself you can blame! Only yourself you can blame! 

Chorus 

Hey! Won't you tell me your name and justify your way of thinking, Walking the stairs 
of the manipulated ones - only yourself.. only yourself you can blame! Only yourself 
you can blame
