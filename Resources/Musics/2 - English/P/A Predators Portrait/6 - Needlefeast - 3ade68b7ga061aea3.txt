NEEDLEFEAST

Well, It's one for the money, two for the show, it makes no difference where I go, push 
injectors in my skin, to make my mission being, Needles to fly, needlefeast, Needles to die, 
Needlefeast, Gotta get inside, Gotta get inside, Needles to die, Needles to fly Burning up 
my hunger lay it all to rest! Waking up my hostile pain, put it to the test, When all is 
said and done I tell you I'm the one, The one to reign supreme, I'm like a brick wall, I'm 
a solid player and I'm standing tall, Who can make me fall, On this very road... Needles 
to fly, needlefeast, needles to die, needlefeast, gotta get inside, gotta get inside, 
needles to die, needles to fly! FLY! FLY! FLY! FLY! 

Chorus 
This life i cannot face it, with the writings on the wall, this time it's hard to face it 
As i'm screaming - What am i doing here?!! 

I bite the days like a suction pump, Another breath, another punch, It makes me catch my 
breath, Needles to fly, needlefeast, needles to die, needlefeast, gotta get inside, gotta 
get inside, needles to die, needles to fly! FLY! FLY! FLY! FLY! 

Chorus 

Before you steal my breath away I like to know if i was led astray, neurosis comes to me 
at night, It holds the truth cause I'm.. one for the money, two for the show, Straight to 
hell is where i go!!! one for the money, two for the show, Straight to hell is where i 
go!!! one for the money, two for the show, Straight to hell is where i go!!! GO! GO! GO! 
GO! GO!!!!!!! 

Chorus 
This life I cannot face it, with the writings on the wall, this time - it's hard to face it 
As I'm screaming - What am i doing here!?? (repeat)
