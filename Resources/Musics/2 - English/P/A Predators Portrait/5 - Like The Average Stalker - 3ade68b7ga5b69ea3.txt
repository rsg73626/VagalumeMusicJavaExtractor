LIKE THE AVERAGE STALKER

I think you just forgot to tell me why, Why i was fading out again, Why my mask of 
sanity was slipping off again, my friend Beware of hatred when your time stands still 

Chorus 
Like the average stalker, Forge to forgive, LIke the average stalker 

I'm just sliding, disappear into the night like a strange and forgotten light, One, two, 
three and i'm at your door, Calculating infinity, In my silence where no one else can hear, 
What is right, what is wrong (RIGHT, WRONG) In my silence where no one else forgives, 
Where the sane and insane strikes together as one 

Chorus 

Where is the fire it makes no sense at all, Im just hiding beneath the hour, Disabled 
through affliction I can't reach out Reach out, in my silence where no one else can hear, 
What is right, what is wrong (RIGHT, WRONG) In my silence where no one else forgives, 
Where the sane and insane strikes together as one, with a violent work of art I proceed, 
in this lack of faith I get what I need, What i need! 

Chorus 
Like the average stalker, Forge to forget, Like the average stalker, Like a silent talker, 
Like the average stalker
