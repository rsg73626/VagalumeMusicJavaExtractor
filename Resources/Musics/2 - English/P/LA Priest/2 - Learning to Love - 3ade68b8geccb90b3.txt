LEARNING TO LOVE

[Intro]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love, learning to kiss
Learning to lose your body and not to resist
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over

It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love, learning to kiss
Learning to lose your body and not to resist
It'll be just like learning to love all over again
It'll be just like learning to love all over
(Learning to love)
(Learning to love)
