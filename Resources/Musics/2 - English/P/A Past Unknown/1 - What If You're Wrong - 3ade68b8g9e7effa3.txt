WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG

Have you not heard of me? 
False hope, false love, the silent enemy. 
I've done my best, I've kept you deceived. 
Faith still grows in more than one answer, 
Only my god frees, my god redeems, 
Stop honoring the dead among the living.

Burn your incense down to these silent ears 
That hear no one. all this time your screaming 
Makes no sound and it's death you've found. 
Where's the hero? where is truth when death sets in the blood? 
The grave still holds the names who claimed a way, all but one.

This world will burn. whose side are you on? 
Show me your faith, you will get no answer. 
Suffocation fills your lungs when no one keeps you breathing. 
Show me a sign, the dead can't answer. failure, again and again. 
Set yourself up for the fall with these empty words 
And useless rituals.

Calling out to no one only silence will be heard. 
Your hero is no longer breathing, sound the alarm, 
No hope. I hear no one, you hear no one, 
Give me an answer, where is your god now?

When will confusion end? this world will burn,
Leave nothing left. when all the hope seems dead, 
You're the one still breathing. their eyes will turn to you, 
The one who rose, the only truth, confessing with their tounges 
"I'm the one who's wrong"

Burn your incense down, no one will hear you. 
Where's the hero now, it's death that you've found. death, 
Where is your sting? you will never claim me cause the grave 
Still holds the names who claimed a way, all but one, 
All but my god.
