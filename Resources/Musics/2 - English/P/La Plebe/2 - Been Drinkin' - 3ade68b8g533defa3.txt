BEEN DRINKIN'

Well I’ve been drinkin’ most my lifetime
I’ve never really known another way
On Saturday I take all my live-long pay
And I piss it all away

So won’t you please turn up that sweet ol’ jukebox
Let the music take me far away
‘Cause since she left that day
All my blue skies have turned gray
And I just don’t feel like missin’ her today

When I was young a drunkard told me something
“Don’t let the swillin’ get in the way
You’ve got to hold your own
‘Cause like me you’ll be alone
And you’ll have to make it through the day”

So won’t you please turn up that sweet ol’ jukebox
Let the music take me far away
‘Cause since she left that day
All my blue skies have turned gray
And I just don’t feel like missin’ her today
