ASTROBOY

If, you feel a heavy smoke,
and the trash is around you.
if you are lonely in the city,
you think that you want it.

I know that for something,
your foot still walks away,
and that you will arrive at a
dark horizon.

If you need an animal,
call my name!, call my name!,
If you need an animal,
call my name!, call my name!
