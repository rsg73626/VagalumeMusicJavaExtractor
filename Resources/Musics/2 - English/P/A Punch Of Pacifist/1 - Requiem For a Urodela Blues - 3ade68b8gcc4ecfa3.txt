REQUIEM FOR A URODELA BLUES

Got a face that's full of knotholes
Got a salamander's check
Got 12 wooden spoons and a rheumatic's breath
Bin fixin for a beatin
Strawman charlie and the goat parade/
Been a stealin and a schemin
Oh well how the plans were laid
This is one of the things at my disposal
Why don't ya go ahead and tell me how it ends
Is my proposal

Got cancer of the tongue
And i gots glycerine in the hole
Got a stolen marshall's gun but no place to call my own
Bin fixin for a beatin
Strawman charlie and the goat parade
Been a stealin and a schemin
Oh well how the plans were laid
This is one of the things at my disposal
Why don't ya go ahead and tell me how it ends
Is my proposal

And when the computer moon decides to fall like rain/
Will the optomistic lady lay beside the fawn again

Got an envelope fulla dirt
Gots me a salvation army seal
Carryin a bag full of broken ladies fashion high heels
Bin fixin for a beatin
Strawman charlie and the goat parade
Been a stealin and a schemin
Oh well how the plans were laid
This is one of the things at my disposal
Why donâ€™t ya lemme tell me how it ends
Is my proposal

Been fixin for a beatin'
Been fixin' for a beatin'
