AROUND & AROUND / ZAPATOS DE GAMUZA

I said the joint was rockin
Goin' round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rockin
Till the moon went down
Well it sounds so sweet
I had to take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
I just had to dance
Started movin' my feet
Oh! a clappin' my hands
I said....
Yeah at twelve o'clock
Yeah the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
Andwhen the police knocked
Those doors flew back
I said... puedes matar
Y el asesinar
Todo mi dinero
Me puedes robar
Coches nuevos
Puedes chocar
Pero por favor
No me pises ya nunca mis zapatos
Zapatos de gamuza azul
Y no me pisen jam√°s mis zapatos
De gamuza azul... (repite)
Zapatos de gamuza azul oh oh oh (repite)
