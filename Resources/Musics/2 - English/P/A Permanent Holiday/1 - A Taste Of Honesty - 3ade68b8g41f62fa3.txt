A TASTE OF HONESTY

I close my eyes, 
I'm waiting just to dream, 
a small escape from this harsh reality, 
I'm waiting for a taste of honesty, 
cause when it's real, 
that's all i'll ever need 

I fall to my knees, 
is it you or the drugs I see 

you're standing right in front of me, 
how come I haven't seen you in weeks, 
you're standing right in front of me, 
I don't recognise the girl that I see 
I miss you, 
I can't do this without you, no 

wherever you go that's where i wanna be, 
when the sky falls upon you and me, 
i'll hold you close without letting you know, 
when daylight comes I will let you go 

I fall to my knees, 
is it you or the drugs I see 

you're standing right in front of me, 
how come I haven't seen you in weeks, 
you're standing right in front of me, 
I don't recognise the girl that I see 
I miss you, 
I can't do this without you, no 

It goes on and on, 
the time is turning, 
lessons learning, 
now we can't go back, 
It goes on and on, 
the time is turning, 
lessons learning, 
now we can't go back, 

you're standing right in front of me, 
how come I haven't seen you in weeks, 
you're standing right in front of me, 
I don't recognise the girl that I see 
I miss you, 
I can't do this without you, no 
It goes on and on, 
the time is turning, 
lessons learning, 
now we can't, we can't go back
