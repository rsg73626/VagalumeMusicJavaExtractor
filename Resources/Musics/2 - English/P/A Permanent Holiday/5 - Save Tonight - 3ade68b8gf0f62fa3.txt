SAVE TONIGHT

I hope the love you gave me
Is not from the drugs you're taking
And I hope this goodbye was for real
And not from the numbness that you feel
Been here before and after
Been too long since he's heard her laughter
Have you gone to the point of no return?
Lit the candle at both ends to burn

And I'll save tonight
Let's make this right
And send out apologies
And I'll stay tonight
Let's say goodnight
And talk in the morning

Your lips, they taste of alcohol
First sign that I should not care at all
I lose control, say things I don't mean
Once things said, nothing helps, no apologies
One thing that I will confess
The situation turns me into a mess

And I'll save tonight
Let's make it right
And send out apologies
And I'll stay tonight
Let's say goodnight
And talk in the morning

So you say that you drank too much
Please explain to me why you never cared too much
I just need some time to think this through
Your disease isn't just killing you
It's killing me too
It's killing me too
It's killing me too
It's killing me too
It's killing me too
It's killing me too

And I'll save tonight
Let's make this right
And send out apologies
And I'll stay tonight
Let's say goodnight
And talk in the morning
We'll talk in the morning
I'll save tonight
We'll talk in the morning
