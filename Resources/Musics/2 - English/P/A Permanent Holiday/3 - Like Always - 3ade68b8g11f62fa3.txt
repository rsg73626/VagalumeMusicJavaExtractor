LIKE ALWAYS

No matter what you say, 
you'll never change, 
no matter what you do, 
you stay the same 
you break me down like always, 
no matter what I gave you never feel, 
no matter what you say it seems unreal, 
i'm breaking down like always 

like when our hearts had been forgotten, 
and the words become too much, 
no matter where we end up, 
for all the times i should have shut up 

what would you say if i left, 
the only words i confess, 
i can't live with or without you, 
there's nothing left to hold on to 

I let time pass hoping for change, 
I let you in hoping today, 
don't break me down like always 
like memories that start to fade, 
like thoughts of wanting yesterday 
I've dissappeared like always 

like when our hearts had been forgotten, 
and your words become too much, 

what would you say if i left, 
the only words i confess, 
i can't live with or without you, 
there's nothing left to hold on to 

I will always love you, 
but I can't live with or without you 

what would you say if I left, 
the only words I confess, 
I can't live with or without you, 
what would you say if i left, 
the only words i confess, 
i can't live with or without you, 
there's nothing left to hold on to 
what would I say if you left, 
the only words you confess, 
I can't live with or without you, 
there's nothing left to hold onto 

what would you say if I left
