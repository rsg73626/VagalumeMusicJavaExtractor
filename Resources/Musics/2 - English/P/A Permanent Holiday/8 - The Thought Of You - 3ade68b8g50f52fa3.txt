THE THOUGHT OF YOU

I'll be here with you forever
When times get hard
We'll be together
But they don't know us
They say I'm crazy
But I don't hear the word they're saying

Just a thought of you gets me through the days
Just a thought of you
Together we'll move on
Just a thougt of you

I count the days that I've been without you
I count the days in bed without you
I wonder where I'll be tomorrow
Cause life without you is so hard to swallow
Days and nights all planned together now

Just a thought of you gets me through the days
Just a thought of you
Together we'll move on
Just a thougt of you

Tell me If I am over my head
Tell me If I am over my head

Just a thought of you gets me through the days
Just a thought of you
Together we'll move on
Just a thougt of you
