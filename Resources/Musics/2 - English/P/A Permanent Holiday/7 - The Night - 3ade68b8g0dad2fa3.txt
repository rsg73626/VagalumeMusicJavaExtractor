THE NIGHT

I close my eyes, 
but all I see 
is everything wrong in front of me, 
the lights fade black, 
the curtains close, 
we can't go back, 
cause the truth I know, 
so watch me as I leave 

The night your heart was broken, 
the words that went unspoken, 
were the ones that meant it all, 
you swore that you wouldn't, 
you tried but you couldn't, 
you left and let me fall, 
so tonight I let you go, 

he gave his all, 
now there's nothing left, 
make a last call, 
as he holds his breath, 
he hears her voice, 
but she won't confess, 
as he opens the door, 
now there's nothing left, 
so watch me as I leave 

The night your heart was broken, 
the words that went unspoken, 
were the ones that meant it all, 
you swore that you wouldn't, 
you tried but you couldn't, 
you left and let me fall, 
so tonight I let you go, 

why did you have to let me fall, 
I thought I knew it all, 
seems I just don't know, 
and when did you let go, 
cause your feelings never show, 
seems i've lost it all, 
so tonight i let you go 

The night your heart was broken, 
the words that went unspoken, 
were the ones that meant it all, 
you swore that you wouldn't, 
you tried but you couldn't, 
you left and let me fall, 
so tonight I let you go
