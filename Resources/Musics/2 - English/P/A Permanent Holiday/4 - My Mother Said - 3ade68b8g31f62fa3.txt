MY MOTHER SAID

I've said it before and I'll say it again, 
that I hope and I pray that this is not the end, 

my mother said 
let her go, 
if it's meant to be, 
she'll come back eventually, 
so I let her go, 
but what they don't know, 
and what she can't see, 
is inside i'm dying 

(woah woah) My hands are shaking, 
(woah woah) My Heart she's taking, 
(woah woah) part of me is gone 
(woah woah) she's been gone too long 

so it's time to let go 
but I can't, 
and she knows, 
so can we just pretend, 
like this is not the end 

my mother said 
let her go, 
if it's meant to be, 
she'll come back eventually, 
so I let her go, 
but what they don't know, 
and what she can't see, 
is inside i'm dying 

(woah woah) My hands are shaking, 
(woah woah) My Heart she's taking, 
(woah woah) part of me is gone 
(woah woah) she's been gone too long 

well I thought she was the one for me, 
but now she's gone, 
I guess it wasn't meant to be 

My mother said let her go, 
if it's meant to be, 
she'll come back eventually 

(woah woah) My hands are shaking, 
(woah woah) My life she's taking, 
(woah woah) part of me is gone 
(woah woah) she's been gone too long 
(woah woah) she's been gone too long 
and now i'm letting go, 
i'm letting go, 
i'm letting go
