SOS

I lost it all 
but somehow you came to find, 
where have you been, 
without me all this time, 
you contradict all that i did believe, 
now that you're here, 
please take me and let's leave 

I send out signals at night and wait for your return, 

This is an sos to you, 
will you save me, 
this is an sos to you, 
you're all that I need, 
this is an sos to you, 
now that you're here, 
I believe, 
this time I know i'll make it, 
I can see it in your eyes 

when the smoke clears, 
and I see your face, 
I finally found myself in the right place, 
anywhere with you, 
is better than where i've been, 
you brought me back when I thought it was the end 

I send out signals at night and wait for your return, 

This is an sos to you, 
will you save you, 
this is an sos to you, 
you're all that I need, 
this is an sos to you, 
now that you're here I believe, 
this time I know i'll make it, 
I can see it in your eyes 

(find me alone)This is an sos to you, 
(all on my own)will you save me 
(find me alone)this is an sos to you, 
(all on my own)you're all that I need, 
(find me alone)this is an sos to you, 
(all on my own)now that you're here I believe, 
this time I know i'll make it, 
I can see it in your eyes, 
this time i know i'll make it by the look in your eyes
