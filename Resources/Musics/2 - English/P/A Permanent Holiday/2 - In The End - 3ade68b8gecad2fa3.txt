IN THE END

I'm sorry, you deserve more,
So as you walk out that door,
Please know that I will change,
Living without you won't be the same,
So don't leave me

Baby, give me one more chance,
I wanna feel your love again,
Because I just can't imagine,
Not being with you in the end,
I am sorry

I know that I was wrong,
Seems like it has been so long,
Since I have felt this pain,
I've lost all that was good for me,
I am sorry

Baby, give me one more chance,
I'm trying just to make amends,
I'm sorry for the things I did,
I'm sorry for the things I said,
Baby, give me one more chance,
I wanna to feel your love again,
Because I just can't imagine,
Not being with you in the end,
I am sorry

All this fighting seems so pointless,
As the saying goes, we forget,
What we have, take advantage,
Of what we got,
All this fighting seems so pointless,
Wish I could change all my choices,
Cause I wouldn't take advantage,
Cause now she's gone

Baby, give me one more chance,
I'm trying just to make amends,
I'm sorry for the things I did,
I'm sorry for the things I said,
Baby, give me one more chance,
I wanna to feel your love again,
Because I just can't imagine,
Not being with you in the end,
So don't leave me
