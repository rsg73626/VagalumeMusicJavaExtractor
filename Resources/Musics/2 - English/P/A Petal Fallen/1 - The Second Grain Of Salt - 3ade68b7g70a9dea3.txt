THE SECOND GRAIN OF SALT

And as theese days pass by
We continue our useless attempts at love
We should have lived in the past
I am only silver not bronze or gold defective for loving
This heart with bullet holes now belongs to me
Is slowly wilting
Wilting
Along with theese dreams they become nothing but air
And though we thought the exit was clearer it only became blurred
I am eating myself
This solitude is not solidary
Riddled with shards i am
My second wish wil live
My request wont be so great
My second wish will live
As i drown in denial
I awake
It wont be too complicated
Twice now ive been spat upon
Taken with the second grain of salt
My life is not taken
Never my second wish will live
