RISE ABOVE THE STREETLIGHTS

Out of all the words 
You spoke
These were sealed 
Half-past your lips
And with every exhale
I will breathe them in
But I forgot the storyline
I forgot my place to stand
So I held my head high
And now it's stuck 
Beneath my spine

It is time to turn 
And face the sun
Forget "safety in solace"
We have battles to be won
I carry untold secrets
And despite my lies I bet
That you will come 
To know me
As the one 
That fought the rest

I will breathe 
For the first time
When I cast you 
Out of my life
We will run 
And dance and scream 
And speak and shout 
In foreign tongues
Do you remember 
Why we bloomed so well?
Did I surrender 
To your white thighs?
This is silence
This is the end

It is time to turn 
And face the sun
Forget "safety in solace"
We have battles to be won
I carry untold secrets
And despite my lies I bet
That you will come to know me
As the one that fought the rest

So pick it up 
Pick it up, pick it up
Come on and show me 
What your made of
Seven years 
In horrid daylight 
And yet you complain?
So honestly, yeah?
Do you expect me 
To remember?
Like you can wrap me 
'Round your finger
I'll be dancing 
On your fist

It is time to turn 
And face the sun
Forget "safety in solace"
We have battles to be won
I carry untold secrets
And despite my lies I bet
That you will come to know me
As the one 
That fought the rest
