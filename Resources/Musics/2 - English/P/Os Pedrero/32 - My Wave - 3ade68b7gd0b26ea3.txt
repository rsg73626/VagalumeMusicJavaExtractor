MY WAVE

When i feel,when i touch
when i kiss your sweet lips
i can love,i can scream
my heart beats faster
my soul flies,my blood boils
when i dance with you babe
i'm all right!i'm okay!
i feel so good with my wave!
when i close my eyes
i see you,i see your body
i see your body
i see your heart
i'm not alone
i feel my wave
my wave...
my wave...
