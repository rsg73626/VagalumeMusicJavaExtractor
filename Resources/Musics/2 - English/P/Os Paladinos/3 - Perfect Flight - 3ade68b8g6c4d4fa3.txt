PERFECT FLIGHT

You're much more perfect than a flower
It was love at first sight
You give me happiness and power
You give me love and pride

You're in the light of the sunrise
You're in the waves of the sea
Oh honey you're very nice
My life, now, is a paradise
You are too important to me

Your love caught my whole soul
I think of you wherever I go
You're everything that I can see
I promise I'll never hurt thee
With you all seem to be great
I keep on mind our first date

In the perfect night
You were pretty and bright
And asked me how to fly
I said: "Close your eyes
We are going high
Our love is the guide
Don't be afraid
I'm by your side"

Since I met you my life is better
Everything is funny with you
An angel outside of heaven
The only reason for whatever I do

Like a hurricane in my life
A star that fell from the sky
You are the woman of my dreams
And I'll make you my queen
You are the cure of my disease
I keep on mind your sweet kiss

In the perfect night
You were pretty and bright
And asked me how to fly
I said: "Close your eyes
We are going high
Our love is the guide
Don't be afraid
I'm by your side"

You worth much more than gold
The most perfect girl all over the world
I know our love will be forever
'Cause we're stronger together
Our passion will grow day by day
Let's love show us the right way

In the perfect night
You were pretty and bright
And asked me how to fly
I said: "Close your eyes
We are going high
Our love is the guide
Don't be afraid
I'm by your side"

In the perfect flight
You were pretty and bright
And showed me your best smile
The beauty of your eyes
I still keep it on my mind
Oh my dear you're very kind
I'll be always by your side!
