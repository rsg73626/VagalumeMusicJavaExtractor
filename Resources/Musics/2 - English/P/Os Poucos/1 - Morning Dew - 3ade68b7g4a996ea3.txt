MORNING DEW

I know that I gotta go some place else
Anywhere where the sun can shine on me
Where I know that the waves won’t be called as a sine
And the sky will be as blue as the sea

I wake in this morning dew, my friend
I wake in this morning dew, just for you
Where I this morning dew, I can be
Just to start to think about you will kill me

And the sand is just as yellow as the sun
The wind blows in and out anywhere I go
The words that you say don’t make no sense
Such as my love for you

I wake in this morning dew, my friend
I wake in this morning dew, just for you
Where I this morning dew, I can be
Just to start to think about you will kill me

And the smell of the flowers is your perfume
I listen to the birds, I hear your voice
On and on I feel you next to me
Turn around and wish that you were here

I wake in this morning dew, my friend
I wake in this morning dew, just for you
Where I this morning dew, I can be
Just to start to think about you will kill me
