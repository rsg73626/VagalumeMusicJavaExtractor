MARFA LIGHTS

If it seams that I'm ok
Pretending that's just fine
Sometimes I'm on my way
Sometimes out of line

I saw my picture on the wall
And they said I was lying
I'm sure today this is my call
I won't obey this time

Rescue me, give me a sign
Show me how to start
Introduce me to the Marfa Lights. 

Arizona is on my mind
And we should be the stars
The "Texas way" ain't far away
We need those Marfa lights

Listen to me I won't bite
Stay with me right on my side
Show to me the famous Marfa Lights, Marfa Lights

I don't need no sympathy
no pity, no cry
I wont repeat listen to me
I need some Marfa Lights

I saw my picture on the wall  
And they said I was lying
I'm sure today this is my call
I won't obey this time

Rescue me, give me a sign
Show me how to start
Introduce me to the Marfa Lights. 

Listen to me I won't bite
Stay with me right on my side
Show to me the famous Marfa Lights, Marfa Lights
