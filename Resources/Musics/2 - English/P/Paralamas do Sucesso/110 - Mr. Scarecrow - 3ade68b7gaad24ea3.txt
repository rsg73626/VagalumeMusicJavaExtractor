MR. SCARECROW

Hey, Mr. Scarecrow
You can't close your eyes
Can't fold your arms
You're always standing still
Watching days pass by 

Hey, Mr. Scarecrow 
In this never-changing view
Of these ever-changing fields
It wouldn't seem unreal to see you cry
To see you cry
But maybe it was just the morning dew

Hey Mr. Scarecrow
If you could walk
If you could see the world
If someone could break your heart

Wouldn't you feel tempted
To come back to these fields
And feel no pain
Just sun and rain to make you fall apart

I've seen you cry
I think I've seen you cry
But maybe
Maybe it was just the morning dew
