IN BETWEEN DAYS

Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
go on go on
just walk away
Go on go on
Your choice is made
Go on go on
And disappear
Go on go on
Away from here

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That I couldnt be me and be her
Inbetween withou you
Without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze m deep inside
Come back come back
Dont walk away
Come back come back
Come back today
Come back come back
Why cant you see
Come back come back
Come back to me

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That I couldnt be me and be her
Inbetween withou you
Without you
