BLOW THE WIND

Almost desperation
I feel quite lost in space and time
No limits no clear options
No where to go no clever answer

I feel so in touch with nature
Through the trees clear sign of the rising sun
No limits no clear options
No where to go just to have some fun

Blow the wind and dry my tears
Show the limits draw the line
Blow the wind and dry my tears
And I'm sure I'll feel just fine

Blow the wind and dry my tears
Show the limits draw the line
Blow the wind and dry my tears
I'm sure I'll feel just fine!
