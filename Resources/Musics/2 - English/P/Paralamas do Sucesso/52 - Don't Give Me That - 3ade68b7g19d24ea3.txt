DON'T GIVE ME THAT

Don't give me that 
Don't give me no coke, no crack 
You've ever heard about Richard Pryor 
The greatest comedian in America 

He is full of petrol 
He is full of women 

In California he is a big actor 
One morning I read in the papers 
The great Richard Pryor, he catch fire 
He was in a big house and tried free-base 

It never worked right 
It blew in his face 
It all went wrong 
I fell sorry for him 

He was burnt up and down 
He was fried like a chicken 

Cocaine, money missing 
With people and brains 
You put it in your nose 
And it makes you go lame 
It makes you walk naked 
In the pouring rain 
And lets you crazy 
To the cross of trains
