THE SCIENTIST WRITES A LETTER

My Dear 
Unless chance finds us face to face again 
This is the last you´ll hear from me 
I spent this sunday, a long afternoon 
Freezing at my friend´s house by the sea 
We men of science...You know 
I´ve returned to my research in magnetic fields 
It´s funny how attractive indifference can be 
My sence of failure...It´s not so important 
Electricity means so much more to me 
We men of science...You know 
It´s snowing again, it seems its always snowing 
I sit down to write, and its so cold 
Outside my window there´s a tree 
So write I can hardly look at it 
It´s quiet here, I look thru my glass 
At patterns all so well defined 
Please send my winter coat soon as you can 
I find I have no other lines 
We men of science....You know 
All the best, all the best for you
