HINCHLEY POND

A cold day with blue skies
The sweet tinkering of the drops
A few little noises
And the wind Whistles
On the tree tops

It all suddenly caught me here
In my bathroom with a view
Colourless days too many
Lovely ones like this
A few

Oh blue skies
Take me there
Drop me by he little pond
Where I was givin a new life
Where my true love belongs
