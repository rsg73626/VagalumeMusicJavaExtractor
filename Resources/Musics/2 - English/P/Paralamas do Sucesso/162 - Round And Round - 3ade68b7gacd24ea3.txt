ROUND AND ROUND

I'm not the person that you used to know, so listen 
I´ve got my head on the ground 
And you still don´t listen 
I can burn the curtains, paint my face in red 
I could lie on a table 
And you could serve me rare 
I´m going round and round and round 
(and Round) 
I never said I´d take you to neverland 
No long sunny afternoons 
No deep blue sea 
This is adult life 
Now it´s you and me 
Tryng to find poetry 
In dirty sheets 
We´re going round and round and round 
(and Round)
