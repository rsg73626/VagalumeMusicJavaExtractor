RUNNING ON THE SPOT

i was hoping we`d make real progress
but it seems we have lost the power
any tiny step of advancement
is like a raindrop falling into the ocean
we`re running on the spot always have always will?
we`re just the next generation of the emotionally crippled

though we keep piling up the building blocks
the structure never seems to get any higher
because we keep kicking out the foundations
i believe in life and i believe in love
but the world in which i live in keeps trying to prove wrong

out the pastures we call society
you can`t see further than the bottom of your glass
only you but easily shocked
you get all violent when the boat get rocked

just like sheep little lambs into the slaughter
truth is you never cared still
you get all violent when the boat gets rocked

intelligenge should be your first weapon
and stop revealing in rejection
and follow yourselves noy someone ageing drain brain
whose quite content to go on feedind your garbage
we`re running on the spot always have always will?
we`re just the next generation of the emotionally crippled
