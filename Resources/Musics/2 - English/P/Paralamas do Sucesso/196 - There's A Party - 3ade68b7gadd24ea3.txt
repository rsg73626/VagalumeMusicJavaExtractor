THERE'S A PARTY

Phones are ringing all around
But not here in my house
I can hear what people say
I know theyre goin out
Theres a party
In the World at night
Theres a party
And they feel so fine
Theres a party
And theres no one by my side


I dont think they care bout me
When theyre havin fun
I sit and eat and watch TV
The night has just begun
Theres a party
In the World at night
Theres a party
And they feel so fine
Theres a party
And theres no one by my side


A man comes on the silver screen
He seens to know that I have no one else to talk to
To talk to
