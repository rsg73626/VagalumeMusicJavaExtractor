A GOOD LOSER

I know that you think marcharte,
I already know it and I will not stop to you Beam which you want 
Nevertheless it remembers that I
I will be here in he himself place
and if you only have desire to speak
With taste I will listen, 

And if he knew darte more love
knew more than I
Clear that I know to lose
clear that I know to lose 

You do not have so that to disguise
Those tears are of
If you have irte more vetoes already, 

Nevertheless it hoped that you remained
But the water is necessary to let it run
While I I swallowed words
That I could not say

Goo Primos de Durango!!!!!!!!!
With A Love You Chiquita

And if the wind blows to your favor
 I will not keep resentment to you
Clear that I know to lose
It will not be the first time Today you go away tomorrow I will go away I
I will be a good loser
The world will not change
Somebody without a doubt occupies your place

Nevertheless it hoped that you remained
But the water is necessary to let it run
While I I swallowed words
That I could not say
