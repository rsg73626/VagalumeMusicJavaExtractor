IDIOT PENGUIN

So many times I nearly forget who you are and it's so often that I lose your porcelin heart.
And it never fails to burn deep inside my soul.
You know me for who I am as I am safe from the evil one.
I lower my head in pain for what I've done.
How could you ever love me now?
It hurts to look away from things that tear away your hand from mine but you gave me all this world before I opened my eyes.
now every sunset is promising, and every sunrise feels like a new day.
i took this knife and ruined everything for this life i live with you.
