BRIANA

I am sick. 
I am nothing but failure on my own. 
The sun came up in your room the morning you reached out your hand and asked for a penny but 
I wanted to give you gold and silver. 
Peace can disintegrate but love can't terminate. 
I breathe systematic death in fascination. 
Still alive just incase everything is just a dream. 
My spirit hangs over the fire that rises and frays away the edges that keep the rain from falling. 
His hands will keep you from falling.
