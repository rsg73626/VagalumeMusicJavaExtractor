D-UP (IN CHAPEL HILL)

i can't stand the memories that rivers won't let me relive. hand in hand and mouth to mouth. ashes to sin. 
we prayed on a star. 
i have to find another way to lift myself up and over the pain. then i wouldn't lose my broken heart at the thought of a life that could be gone. 
it goes on and on and on. 
the walks that i still dream about. 
the fields that carry my hands, reaching out. 
artemis, screaming for truth, now you're suffocating in your lies over sounding seas. 
tearing up the amazon. 
so i can feel whole again.
