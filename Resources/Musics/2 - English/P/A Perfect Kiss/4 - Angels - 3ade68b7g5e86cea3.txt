ANGELS

Friend, everything 
I've ever wanted is gone. 
I gave it all away.
It was never mine, anyway. 
Friend, my insides are hollow. 
I can't breathe air anymore. 
I'm here today but gone tomorrow. 
I'm living forever. Right now 
I can't see you. 
I'm breaking my way through walls. 
Climbing over mountains and swimming through oceans. 
I'm running away from myself. 
Good friend, I need you. 
You're the only thing holding my heart. 
Oh friend, I can't live without you. 
You're the perfection, the uncondition, the only true love.
