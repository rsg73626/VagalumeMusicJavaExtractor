ASHES (OF MY PAJAMA PANTS)

A kiss for the dream. 
A kiss for the greed. 
What was once your eyes is now dripping down my throat. 
If it does seem that my heart is black, not redeemed... 
fade out my eyes and look into the sun. 
Just because 
I've turned myself around doesn't mean 
I can't still see what's behind me.
