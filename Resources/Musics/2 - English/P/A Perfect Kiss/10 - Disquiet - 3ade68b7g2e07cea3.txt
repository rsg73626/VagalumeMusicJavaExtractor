DISQUIET

Don't fall in love...
I'm a double-edged sword. 
I know your hands aren't pure so 
I am not your cure. 
And this feels like heaven. 
I won't go back to relive her everything 'cause you're enough to take my breath away. 
If it's all just a dream to teach us to live again then 
I don't want to wake up. 
And it's so pointless now to revive history. 
In this new love 
I live, eternity will prevail. 
And now for some reason you see something in me. 
There is something in you that 
I can't help but caress. 
I can't help but smile.
