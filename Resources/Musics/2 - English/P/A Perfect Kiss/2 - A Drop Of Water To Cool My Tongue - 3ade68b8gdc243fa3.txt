A DROP OF WATER TO COOL MY TONGUE

Do you realize what you've done to the inside of me? 
Just thinking about you uses all my energy
And my fists are bleeding and my walls are breaking
Just like my heart
When I remember you and what we've been through
And how I drift back and forth and play love like a game, I'm sorry
