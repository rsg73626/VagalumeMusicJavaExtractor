MY DISASTER

Take my life, break my heart.
It takes a lot to be an honest man because I deny your Son.
Addicted to the light of an angel in disguise.
I ruined us. I ruined you for eternity.
Take my life, break my heart.
Fade your own eyes, disposition.
Fade your own eyes with me.
It's alright. It's alright.
You make it alright.
