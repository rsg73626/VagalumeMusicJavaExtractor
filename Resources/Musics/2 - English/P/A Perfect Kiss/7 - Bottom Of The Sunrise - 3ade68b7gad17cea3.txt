BOTTOM OF THE SUNRISE

Lead me to Sleep and Death. 
There's no one else 
I'd rather love. 
Touch me, ivory and truth. 
There's nothing else 
I'd rather feel. 
I wouldn't wake up smiling unless 
I was alone. 
I wouldn't sleep alone unless my breath reflected love. 
Will i confess our lies? 
While everything 
I love dies. 
Sick to death til I'm done. 
What have I left to love? 
This will be the death of me.
