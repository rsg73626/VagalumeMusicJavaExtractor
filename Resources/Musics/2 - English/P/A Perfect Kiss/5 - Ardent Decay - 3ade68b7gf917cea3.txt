ARDENT DECAY

We suddenly break. Feeding sorrow and rage. So burn down this age. It's winter and joy is dead. It's time to try again. You'll see my face is drowning in oceans of my own tears. Bleeding from your knife. (Like you care.) Bleeding from this night. (Like you care.) Bleeding from the heart. (Like you care.) We called our one and only. (Like I care.) This year passed like March and April. Spring shades die on the death bed of our losing hope. Fields of the underworld disperse into beyond. And some things fail, as did we. So what do you have to say for yourself? And some things fail, as did we. Why does this alll still kill? And some things fail, as did we.
