SUPERNATURAL SUPERGLUE

What hurts more than being alone is being away from you. 
My eyes could never see all of my life that is yours to taste. 
And I taste you slowly drifting unalive. 
And you are in my dreams, clung to me. 
You will be come me. We will have the same name. 
The future is already here in my mind. 
I can't bare to say what I feel. 
These are lies. These are lies. These are all lies. 
The truth still remains what I can't explain: how much I believe and how much I love you. 
Words are nothing. 
These are all lies.
