NIGHT

Night falls. I sweet talk and lie.
I create a life to hide.
I drain and find pretty eyes beside the reason I'm alive.
I am nothing holy, only lead filled with holes.
I am not an example to the other side.
I now realize why I am alive.
so I take this knife and ruin everything.
Running for my life so I can spell relief.
Everything built up inside is now blood on my hands.
I am your earthly breath, I am your bleeding dream.
I am the whole of you. I am not what i seem.
I know I can't give up so many things.
Such as you and tonight.
Tonight I fail. tonight I lie. tonight is not the night I'd want to spend with you.
