THE END WASTED

The power that failing brings could melt your hard heart, dear Scylla.
But someday take those monstrous forms.
I wish I knew if everything I've hoped for is real, if my audible heart could ever move anyone.
Beloved Ocean guides us.
My chariot is growing tired of all this hopeless siren sound.
