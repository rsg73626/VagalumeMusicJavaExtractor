THE MEDICATION

I can't believe you're still alive.
And after all, I too, survived.
The cure is here.
It's medical and spiritual and forever yours.
Theres a place where we belong.
My embrace where you belong.
It's still light out and we are hand in hand.
We can't go back to dark days and mistakes.
Remember our start?
Remember when I was never a lie?
In spite of my angel carrying me home, I was never a lie. Everything has to change.
