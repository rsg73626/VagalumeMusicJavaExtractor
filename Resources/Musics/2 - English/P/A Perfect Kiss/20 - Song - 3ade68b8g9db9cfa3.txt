SONG

Burnt reruns and memories.
I rot but these aren't mine.
Demons circle my body.
Fraying away light inside.
You look OK there so this can't be real.
You can't be alive. You can't be anything. I can't see. Only projectors in my heart.
I can't move. and I can't breathe.
It comes to haunt me. Get out of me, can't you remember who I am?
And who I want to be?
I'm afraid to open my eyes.
