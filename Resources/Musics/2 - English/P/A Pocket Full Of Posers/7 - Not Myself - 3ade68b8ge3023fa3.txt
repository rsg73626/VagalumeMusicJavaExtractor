NOT MYSELF

Today Im just not myself, to many things are going through my head
So many things I cant think straight, I hang my head in self-defeat
It could be the loneliness getting to me, but its only been one day since we have talked
What is it that your doing to me, is it that you ripped my heart out of my chest

Ive never felt this way before, please just show me to the door
I have to get away because its killing me
I finally figured out that Im a loser
No one like you could fall for me

I guess its fine if we are just friends, although I know I really wanted more
I hope this felling pass through me, I dont want to feel the pain that much longer
Its just that

Ive never felt this way before, please just show me to the door
I have to get away because its killing me
Ive never felt this way before
