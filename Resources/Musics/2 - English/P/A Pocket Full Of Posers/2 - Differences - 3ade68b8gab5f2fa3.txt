DIFFERENCES

Finally got a moment to myself
And I'm so tired I don't know what to do
It's hard to figure out what we're going to do
And the differences between me and you

Only time will tell what we have to do
To make our problems go away
Nothing's working out like we want it to
But in the end we'll be okay

Nothing's getting any better
Will things keep on getting worse
Weeks go by and I still can't make you happy
What do I have to do

What do I have to do to make you understand I really care
It hurts me when you say it seems like nothing's there
