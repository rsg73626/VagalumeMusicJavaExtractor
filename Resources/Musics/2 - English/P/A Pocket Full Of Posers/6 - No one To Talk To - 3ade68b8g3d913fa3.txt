NO ONE TO TALK TO

I tell you not to come, but I still wait for your call
The things that I do don't make any sense at all
I know you're not here and I know it's my fault
Why do I say these stupid things, why am I alone tonight?

There's no one to talk to, there's no one to care
There's no one to talk to cause no one is there
I'm just a boy who's out of his mind
I couldn't be yours and you couldn't be mine

Still
