LONELY TEARS

Don't feel sorry it's not your fault
Don't feel worried I'm not going to let you fall
I just hope that I don't break
I hope things will be ok
I'm just not sure if I have what it takes

To keep you here
To keep you near
Ill pray for the day when there's no more lonely tears

So before you go Whoo
Just thought that I would let you know Whoo
I wish that you could stay
I hope everything is ok
I'm still not sure if I have what it takes
