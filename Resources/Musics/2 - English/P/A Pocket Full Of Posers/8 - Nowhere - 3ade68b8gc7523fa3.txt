NOWHERE

I take a look around
At all the things you do
And I`m not really sure
Sure if I deserve

All the time we spent
I won`t let it end
Will this ever end

Sometimes all the time
Is just not enough,
Not enough to do everything I want to do with you
Sometimes all the time
Is just not enough,
Not enough to show you how much I really care

Sometimes I wonder
What it would be like if you were not around
Sometimes I wonder
Where we would be now, we`d be nowhere

Our relationship has grown
We`ve gone so far so fast
And everything fits right
Cause we were built to last

Everyday goes by
And with you by my side
Nothing can go wrong
And we`ve known it all along

I want to do the things we talked about it`s true
I want to fit everything in
I want to do the right and never do the wrong
All I want is to hold on
