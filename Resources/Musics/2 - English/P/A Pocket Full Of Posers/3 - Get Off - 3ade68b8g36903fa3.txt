GET OFF

This high school crap is really lame, it`s really driving me insane
Complicated, agitated thoughts inside my little brain
I`m sick of being put and let down, these thoughts again come running round
Just let me be until I find my way, I never said that life would be easy
I`m just a kid try to understand, I`m not in any rush to grow up

Get off my case, and let me be
Get off my case

I`m just a kid try to understand I`m not in any rush to grow up
Don`t want to go to work, don`t want to go to school
Don`t want to drive a car, just want to play guitar

Get off my case, and let me be
I`m not here for you

I miss you, where did you go?
I called you but no ones home
I miss you, I`m all alone
This is a really cheesy song
