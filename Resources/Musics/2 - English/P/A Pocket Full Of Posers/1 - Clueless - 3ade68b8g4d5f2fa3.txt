CLUELESS

Sometimes i wonder why i'm left without a clue
Sitting in my room, i don't know what to do
I wonder in what went on, am i living my life
Will i ever know, if i'm playing all my cards right

Why do i feel this way, am i trying hard enough
Why do i feel this way, though there are no regrets inside of me

Chorus

Where did i go wrong?
Seems like i've been here for way to long
Where did i go wrong?
How can i get my life to move on?

I think about the past and what i could have done
But i wouldn't change a thing cause this is where i belong
Still there's something missing deep inside of me
A goal just out of reach that i can always see

Have i made the right decisions, i will never know
Have i made the right decisions, will i end up where i want to go

Chorus
