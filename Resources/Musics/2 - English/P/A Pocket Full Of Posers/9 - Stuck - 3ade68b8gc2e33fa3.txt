STUCK

So you've gone away today
I feel so empty
Does it have to be this way
This nervousness won't go away
It's stuck inside of me

As you can see
I can't hide the pain
As you can tell
I don't want things to change

I'm stuck here waiting
When will you be coming back
I'll sit here wasting all my time till you get back

Now that you've seen my eyes
You know how much you mean to me
When will you realize
And learn to let love be

As you can see
I can't hide the pain
As you can tell
I don't want you to leave

I'm stuck here waiting
When will you be coming back
I'll sit here wasting all my time till you get back
Till you get back
