KARMA

One step closer to fall off a cliff
And I'm wondering if I should just jump
I know I could've fallen again
Be a victim of myself and my imagination
Look up high no more tears in my eyes
I'm all cried out I feel I'll never die
And now I'm gonna start again
Yea I will cleanse myself

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This heavy karma

I'm the only one who can
Help myself overcome my fears
And it's just a matter of time
For me to get back on my feet
And than I can be reborn yeah I can be reborn
And now I'm gonna start again, no more pain

Ooh if you wanna go
You gotta let them know
The best is what you haven't heard
If you wanna grow
You gotta let them know
The best is what you haven't heard
Read up on your tarot
See now if the stars are aligned
And you can tell the devil
Tell him it's not my time to go
One step closer to fall off a cliff and I'm wondering
