MILK CARTON PHOTOGRAPH

So how does it feel to leave everything behind? 
Kill the man you were 
The one who swore he'd stand through everything...until... 
Do you even know? Or did it sneak up and shock you 
With what i see every day, every time I look on your once beloved face 

You've wandered far from me 
Your absence wounds like daggers dug into my skin 
And twisted deep, until my heart's blood flows 

You had all I wanted and you were all I'd ever hoped to be 
But now I can't believe what you've become 
I hate what you've become 

So what have you found there where you are? 
And is it worth all that you've lost? 
The destiny you were so eager to see 
But you threw it all away 

And you don't even seem to care what you've done 
To those of us who loved you, and who love you still 
Who need you here 

How could you just leave me? How could you... 

...Leave me lying here without you 
Bleeding out without you 

So how does it feel to leave everything behind? 
How does it feel to know that it was all a lie? 
To know that you're a liar 

Or is it just that you think you've gone too far 
To ever come this way again 
When I've been waiting for you all along 

But I won't give up hope that someday 
I'll have you back in my arms 
At least until I see the way things will work out 
At the end
