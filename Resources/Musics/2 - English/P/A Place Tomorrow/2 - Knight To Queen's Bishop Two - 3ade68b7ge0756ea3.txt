KNIGHT TO QUEEN'S BISHOP TWO

So make your move 
This hesitation is killing you 
Leaving you with nothing to show for your life 

Called to something more 
Paralyzed by fright 
Failed before you start 
Knight takes rook...checkmate 

Comfort becomes fear 
When all you've dreamed of seems too distant to obtain 
Its all planned, but he won't do it for you 
So make your move 

If I go, will you come with me? I can't do this on my own 
Hold my hand and calm the fears that overwhelm 
I long to see the fullness of your design for me 
But the strength in my heart is not enough 

Called to something more 
Not paralyzed by fright 
God has made a way 
Knight takes rook...checkmate
