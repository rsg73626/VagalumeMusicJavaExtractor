OF LAPSES IN JUDGEMENT AND THE HEARTACHE THAT FOLLOWS

I don't know why its this way, and I don't know why I care 
When its just a little nothing 
Nothing worth killing myself for 

Poorly tuned, two-fisted folly 
And a stack of yellowed love notes in your hand 
Laced with your own brand of sugared lies 

And I believed every word...found comfort in your arms 
But somehow missed the knife in your hand 


Soft as baby's breath, but with an acid edge 
You burn me with every word you say 
Burn the eyes from my head, and the heart from in my chest 
The least that you could do 
Would be to cauterize the wound before you go 


Tore me limb from limb, and you smiled as I bled 
why? Was I nothing to yoU? 
This mockery of love that you've foisted upon me 
All so I'd be there to meet your needs 
So why do I still love you? 
I hate that I still love you
