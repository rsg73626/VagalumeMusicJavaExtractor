DISCONSOLATE

I want to know why my weakness always seems to overwhelm me 
One brief thought unguarded 
The beast that slumbers is revived 
And I don't know who I am tonight 

A victim of my error, I metamorphosize 
Into something that I myself can hardly recognize 
Sealed by your kiss, or so I thought 
But now I'm bleeding 
And every wound is self-inflicted 

But I searched for my heart, and what I found was you 

Hard to see 
How in my secret heart I am so self-deceiving 
In just one soft moment, the truth inside me is revealed 
And I am found wanting 
Worthless, and far beneath all notice 
For you to hold me is far more than I could ever ask you 
To look past this corruption, and just receive me as I am 
To take me in your arms tonight 

I don't know who I am any more...it seems that I've forgotten 
I only wanted to make you proud...but I've fallen far far short 

I don't know who I am...I just want to make you proud...
