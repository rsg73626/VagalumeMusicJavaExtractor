Like a hawk in a sky
That flies, and
you were my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you
If we keep bumpin’ heads
And you know that one of these days (days)
We gone hook it up
Probably talk from the phone
But see I don´t know if that´s good
I´ve been holdin back
This secret from you
Probably shouldn´t tell you but if I

(refrão)

If I let you know
You can´t tell nobody
I´m talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my body
I´m not just anybody
Is it my go, Is it your go
Sometimes I’m goody goody
Right now I’m naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

Boy,
Won´t you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone
Sleep, Sleep, Sleep
I´ll be waitin there
Wit my trench, my lugz, My hat
Just so I’m low key
If you tell the world
Don´t sleep, you know that we’ll be weak
Oh Boy,
See I’m trusting you
with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn´t let you but, If I
If I let this go......
