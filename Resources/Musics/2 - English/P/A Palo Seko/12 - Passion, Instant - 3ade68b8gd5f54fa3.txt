PASSION, INSTANT

Passion, instant
Sweatbeads fill me
Cupid’s shot me
My heartbeats racing
Tempt me, try me
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It’s yours entirely

(refrão)

I’ll be
(i’ll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover)
I’ll be
(i’ll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a love for you)
I’ll be
((i’ll be more) more than your lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) even more under covers)
I’ll be more
((i’ll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) more than a love for you)

Midnight grindin’
Heartrate’s climbin’
You go, i go
Cause we share pillows
Taste me, feed me
There’s still no separating
Morning massages
With new bones in your closet

I’ll be
(i’ll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover)
I said i’ll be
(i’ll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a love for you)
I’ll be more
((i’ll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) even more under covers)
I’m gonna be
((i’ll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) more than a love for you)

I don’t think your ready
(i don’t think your ready for this thang
For this thang
(i don’t think your ready for this thang)
You’re not ready, oh no
(i don’t think your ready for this thang)
This thing, this thang
(i don’t think your ready for this thang)

Constant pleasure
No scale can measure
Secret treasures
Keeps on getting better
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can go to foreign lands
Your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like bonnie & clyde
Be by your side

I’ll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover
I’ll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a love for you
(i’ll be more) more than your lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) even more under covers
(i’ll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) more than a love for you
