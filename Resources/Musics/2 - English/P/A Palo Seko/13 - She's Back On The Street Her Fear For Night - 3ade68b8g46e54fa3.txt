SHE'S BACK ON THE STREET HER FEAR FOR NIGHT

She´s back on the street her fear for night
Feel you with grief she cuts like a knife
Make you do things that no others could do
She turns a professor into a fool
Oh she ain´t hard to get the girl gets around
And those that she met they´re destined to drown
She´ll make ya change like you like you never believe
She turns a working man into thief
Oh

(refrão)

She´s erica erica erica erica
She´s erica erica erica erica
She´s erica erica erica erica
She´s erica erica erica (erica kane)
She´s erica erica erica erica (yo yo)
She´s erica erica erica erica
She´s erica erica erica erica
She´s erica erica erica(erica kane)
Oh back on the block she´s at it again
She´ll be your friend as long as you spend
I know she torn whole familes apart
She shoot a posion arrow straight threw your heart
Oh this is the day for erica kane
There´s nothing to lose none for her gain
She´ll make a honest man steal from his folks
And drain a million man until he go broke

(refrão)

I really don´t think you should mess around
Cause all she´ll do is bring you down
And there´s nothing for you to gain
And she goes by this name...

(refrão)
