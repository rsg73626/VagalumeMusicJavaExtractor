DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS

(Introduction)
The Evening Star is shining bright
So make a wish, and hold on tight
There's magic in the air tonight

And anything can happen...

(First verse)
In the southland, theres a city
Way down on the river
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver.

They've got music, its always playin.
Starts in the daytime, goes on through the night.
When you hear that music playin,
Hear what I'm sayin, it makes you feel alright.

(Chorus)
Grab somebody, come on down.
Bring your paintbrush, we paintin the town.
Theres some sweetness goin round,
Catch it down in New Orleans.

(Second verse)
They've got magic, good and bad
Makes you happy or make you real sad.
Get everything you want or lose what you had
Down here in New Orleans.

(Chorus)
Hey partner, don't be shy.
Come on down, give us a try
You want to do some livin before you die?
Do it down in New Orleans.

(Third verse)
Shotgun shacks and mansions,
sugar barons and cotton kings.
Rich people, poor people, they all got dreams.
And dreams do come true in New Orleans.
