DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS (FINALE)

There's a city

Way down on the river

Where the women are very pretty

And all the men deliver

They got music

It's always playin'

Start in the daytime, go all through the night

And when you hear that music playin'

Hear what I'm sayin', it make ya feel all right

Grab somebody, come on down

Bring your paintbrush

We're paintin' the town

There's some sweetness goin' around

Dreams do come true

In New Orleans!
