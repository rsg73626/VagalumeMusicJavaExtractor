DIG A LITTLE DEEPER

Mama Odie;
Don't matter what you look like,
don't matter what you wear.
How many rings you got on your finger-
We don't care, no-

Mama Odie & Chorus;
We don't care!

Mama Odie;
Don't matter where you come from,
don't even matter what you are!
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat;
We got em' all in here!

Chorus;
We got em' all in here!

Mama Odie;
If they all knew what they wanted,
What they wanted- need to do.
I told them what they needed,
just like I be telling you!

Mama Odie & Chorus;
You gotta dig a little deeper!

Mama Odie;
Find out who you are!

Mama Odie & Chorus;
You gotta dig a little deeper!

Mama Odie;
It really aint that far!
When you found out who you are,
you find out what you need.

Mama Odie & Chorus;
Blue skies and sun shine; Guaranteed!

Mama Odie;
You gotta dig!

Chorus;
Dig!

Mama Odie;
You gotta dig!

Chorus;
Dig!

Mama Odie;
Prince Froggy is a rich little boy,
you wanna be rich again?
That aint gonna make you happy now.
Did it make you happy then? NO!

Mama Odie & Chorus;
Money aint got no soul!
Money aint got no heart!

Mama Odie;
All you need is some self control.
Make yourself a brand new start!

Mama Odie & Chorus;
You gotta dig a little deeper!

Mama Odie;
Don't have far to go!

Mama Odie & Chorus;
You gotta dig a little deeper!

Mama Odie;
Tell the people Mama told you so!
Can't tell you what you'll find,
maybe love or grant you a piece of mind.
Dig a little deeper and you'll know!

Miss Froggy, might I have a word?
Heh heh heh, yous a hard one, thats what I heard.
Your daddy was a lovin man;
Family through and through.
You your daddy's daughter!
What he had in him, you got in you!

Mama Odie & Chorus;
You gotta dig a little deeper!

Mama Odie;
For you- its gonna be tough.

Mama Odie & Chorus;
You gotta dig a little deeper!

Mama Odie;
You aint dug this far enough!
Dig down deep inside yourself,
you'll found out what you need.

Mama Odie & Chorus;
Blue skies and sunshine; Guaranteed!

Mama Odie;
Open up the window, let in the light dearie!

Chorus;
Blue skies and sunshine!

Chorus;
Blue skies and sunshine!

Tiana;
Blue skies and sunshine...!

Mama Odie;
Guaran- teed...!
