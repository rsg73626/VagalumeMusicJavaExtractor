WHEN WE'RE HUMAN

Louis;
If I were a human being,
I'd head straight for New Orleans!
And I'd blow this horn so hard and strong
like no one they've ever seen!

We've heard of Louis Armstrong, Mr. Sydney Brushade;
All those boys gonna step aside when they hear
that song thats gator playin', Listen!

*Trumpet Solo*

When I'm human, as I hope to be!
I'm gonna blow this horn til the cows come home
and everyone's gonna bow down to me.

Thank you, thank you! *Mwah* *Mwah* Aw thank you!
I love you too baby!

Naveen;
When I'm myself again I want just the life I had.
A great big party every night!
That doesn't sound too bad.

A red head on my left arm, a brunette on my right,
a blonde or two to hold the candles, that seems just
about right, eh Louis?

Life is short, when you're done, you're done!
We're on this earth to have some fun!
And thats the way things are.

Louis;
Tell it brother!

Naveen;
When I'm human, and I'm gonna be!
I'm gonna tare it up like I did before.
Thats a royal garentee!

Tiana;
Your modesty becomes you,
and your sense of responsibilty-
I worked hard for everything I've got,
and thats the way its supposed to be!

When I'm a human again, at least I'll act like one.
If you do your best each and everyday,
good things are sure to come your way!

What you give is what you get!
My daddy said that and I'll never forget!
And I commend it to you.

Louis, Naveen, & Tiana;
When we're human, and we're gonna be!

Louis;
I'm gonna blow my horn!
*Trumpet Solo*

Naveen;
I'm gonna live the high life!

Tiana;
I'm gonna do my best to take my place in the sun...!

Louis, Naveen, & Tiana;
When, we're, human!
