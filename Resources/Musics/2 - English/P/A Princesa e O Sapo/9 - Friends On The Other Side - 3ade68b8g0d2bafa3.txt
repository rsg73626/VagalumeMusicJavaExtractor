FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE

Friends On The Other Side

Dr. Facilier;
Don't you disrespect me little man.
Don't you derogate or deride!
You're in my world now, not your world.
And I got friends on the other side.

Shadows/Chorus;
He's got friends on the other side.

Dr. Facilier;
Thats an echo, gentlemen,
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana.
A little parlor trick, don't worry.

Sit down at my table, put your mind at ease.
If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please.
I can read your future, I can change 'round some, too.

I'll look deep into your heart and soul
(You do have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?)
Make your wildest dreams come true!
I got Vodoo, I got hoodoo, I got things I aint even tried!
And I got friends on the other side.

Shadows/Chorus;
He's got friends on the other side!

Dr. Facilier;
The cards, the cards, the cards will tell.
The past, the present, and the future as well.
The cards... the cards... Just take three.
Take a little trip into your future with me!

Now you, young man, are from across the sea.
You've come from two long lines of royalty,
(I'm a royal myself on my mother's side.)
Your life style's high...!
But your funds are low...

You need to marry a little honey whose daddy got dough.
Mom and dad cut you off, huh, playboy?
Now y'all better get hitched, but hitching ties you down-
You just wanna be free, hop from place to place,
but freedom, takes green... Heh heh heh...

It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need...!
And when I looked into the future is the green that I see.
On you little man, I don't want to waste much time
You've been pushed around all your life!
You've been pushed around by your mother,
and your sister and your brother.
And if you was married-
you'd be pushed around by your wife.

But in your future- the you I see...
is exactly the man you always wanted to be!

Shake my hand. Come on boys.
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand...?

Yes... Are you ready?!

Shadows/Chorus;
Are you ready?!

Dr. Facilier;
Are you ready?!
Transformation Central!

Shadows/Chorus;
Transformation Central!

Dr. Facilier;
Reformation Central!

Shadows/Chorus;
Reformation Central!

Dr. Facilier;
Transmogrification Central!
Can you feel it?
You're changing, you're changing, you're changing, alright!
I hope you're satisfied.
But, if you ain't, don't blame me.
You can blame my friends on the other side... Ah ha ha ha ha!

Shadows/Chorus;
You got what you wanted!
But you lost what you had!
Hush...
[Silence]
