MA BELLE EVANGELINE

Ray;
Look how she lights up the sky,
Ma Belle Evangeline.
So far above me yet I,
Know her heart belongs to only me.
J'et adore, J'et aime Evangeline,
You're my queen of the night,
So still,
So bright.
That someone as beautiful as? she,
Could love someone like me.
Love always finds a way it's true!
And I love you, Evangeline.

Love is beautiful,
Love is wonderful!
Love is everything, do you agree?
Mais' oui!
Look how she lights up the sky,
I love you,? Evangeline.
