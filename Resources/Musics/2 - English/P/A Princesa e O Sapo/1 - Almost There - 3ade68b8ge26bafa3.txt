ALMOST THERE

Tiana
Mama! I don't have time for dates
That's just gunna have to wait a while
Aint got time for messing around
And it's not my style

This old town can slow it down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm getting closer and closer everyday!

And I'm almost there...!
I'm almost there
People down here think I'm crazy
But I don't care!
Trials and tribulations
I've had my share
But there ain't nothing gunna stop me now
Cuz I'm almost there!

I remember daddy told me
Fairy tales can come true
But you gotta make them happen
It all depends on you!
So I worked real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through!

And I'm almost there...!
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there...!
I'm almost there

There's been trials and tribulations
I know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm al-most- there...!
