NEVER KNEW I NEEDED

(ooh)
For the way you changed my plans
For being the perfect distraction
For the way you took the idea that I have
Of everything that I wanted to have
And made me see there was something missing
(oh yeah)

For the ending of my first begin
(ooh yeah yeah) (ooh yeah yeah)
And for the rare and unexpected friend
(ooh yeah yeah) (ooh yeah yeah)
For the way you're something that I never choose
But at the same time something I don't wanna lose
And never wanna be without ever again (oh oh)

You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So when you were here I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So now it's so clear I need you here always

My accidental happily (ever after oh oh oh)
The way you smile and how you comfort me
(with your laughter)
I must admit you were not a part of my book
But now if you open it up and take a look
You're the beginning and the end of every chapter (oh oh)

You're the best thing I never knew I needed (oh)
So when you were here I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
(that I needed)
So now it's so clear I need you here always

Who'd knew that I'd be here
(who'd knew that I'd be here oh oh)
So unexpectedly
(so unexpectedly oh oh)
Undeniably happy (hey)

Said with you right here, right here next to me (oh)
Girl you're the

You're the best thing I never knew I needed
(said I needed oh oh)
So when you were here I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
(needed oh)
So now it's so clear I need you here always
Baby baby
Now it's so clear I need you here always
