DEATH'S HEAD

We watched as the flames
Consumed forests and deserts
Destruction of the age

With thunder the light burst
The sky ablaze
Shadows of those blackbirds
Brought that cold black haze

Dark cloud gather us
The forlorned
Black wings guide us
The scorned

Consumed by fear
We did not understand
We sought to disappear

Bludgeoned by our own hand
For thousands of years
No one made a stand
Now we shed unending tears

Dark cloud gather us
The forlorned
Black wings guide us
The scorned
