MISSING

Dead stars, new moon
There’s no way home

The gloom here she has swallowed
All memories of the sun
Pale visions corrode and hollow
Searching for the missing ones

Cruel dreams circle and divide
Memories distort and collide

Lost
No home
Only the cold earth
Will hold these bones

The gloom here she has swallowed
Memories of what was won
Pale visions corrode the hollow
Praying to the missing one

Dark wind, black rain
There’s no way home

Lost
No home
Only the cold earth
Will hold these bones

Sleeping here under the stars
Truth rings out from the darkness
While the past escapes our lonely hearts
All past cries may be silenced

Lost
No home
Only the cold earth
Will hold these bones

The cold wind breaks our shells
The cold wind sets us free

Dead stars, new moon
There’s no way home
