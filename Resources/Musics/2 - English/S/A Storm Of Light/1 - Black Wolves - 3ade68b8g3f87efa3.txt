BLACK WOLVES

Dark sky horizon
Fragile eyes hide
A soulless babylon preaches
And our guns weep

Soulless killers
Prey on your wild eyes
Fearful cowards
Pray to stark and empty skies

Dawn burns through the trees
Sheltered you hide
A soulless babylon preaches fear
And our guns weep poison

Soulless killers
Prey on your wild eyes
Fearful cowards
Pray to stark and empty skies

Black wolf, fear you
Black wolf, kill you

We were lost in the forest
So cold and so alone
And that black wolf
She led us home

Lead missiles blaze through
Obliterate you

Black wolf
Good night
Goodbye

Soulless killers
Prey on your wild eyes
Fearful cowards
Pray to stark and empty skies
