DESTROYER

We were so afraid
There was no trust
All the televised rage
Filled our minds with rust

And we killed the man
With a different god
And we killed the wolf
Just for his blood

I remember now my selfish crimes
Destroyer of all that terrified

The new dawn rises
Over the poisoned land
We were the virus
Remembrance commands

Take my hand
Step into your grave
Our last breath
We are going to fade

I remember now my selfish crimes
Destroyer of all that terrified

We remember now
We are the fearful destroyers
