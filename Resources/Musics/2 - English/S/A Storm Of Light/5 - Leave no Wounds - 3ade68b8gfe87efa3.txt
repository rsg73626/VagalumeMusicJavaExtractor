LEAVE NO WOUNDS

This history of lies
Cannot be true
Tried to live a good life
To never leave no wounds

Never harmed nor killed a man
Never poisoned the precious land

And I have seen the greed and filth
Crushing down it feeds
And I have watched those open arms
Clutch and smite those dreams

Never harmed nor killed a man
Never poisoned the precious land

This history of lies
Cannot be true
Tried to live a good life
To never leave no wounds

Never harmed nor killed a man
Never poisoned the precious land
