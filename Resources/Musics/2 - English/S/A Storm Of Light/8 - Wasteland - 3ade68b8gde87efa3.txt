WASTELAND

All those days we prayed to those hollow skies
Searching for and following those brilliant lies
Our warm hands clenched onto the weapons
As senseless avarice swallowed our sun

Take me home

Take everything
Every part of me
Throw it into the fires
Of shameful ire

Tarred and soiled
Oh black oil
Feather my soul
In green and gold

I am one
Amongst the soulless
Burn it down to the ground
I am hopeless

Burn all you see
Every life and seed
Throw it into the fires
Our soulless zion

Tarred and soiled
Oh black oil
Feather my soul
In green and gold

I am one
Amongst the soulless
Burn it down to the ground
I am hopeless

We are bound
To the rust
All flesh is gone
It is dust

Empty rotting soulless corpse
A guilty shameful faulty force

I am one
Amongst the soulless
Burn it down to the ground
I am hopeless

We are bound
To the rust
All flesh is gone
It is dust

Take me home
I am home
