COLLAPSE

Night reaches through the years
And all hope is gone

Those silent hills
They hide the dawn
And bury all you’d built

Give up those dreams of fire
The end aligns
Give up those tragic desires
Eternal night

Collapse down and rest
Collapse down, you’ve been blessed

Rusted earth, dead monuments
Everything is gone

Those silent tombs
They hide the past
And bury all you’ve known

Give up those dreams of fire
The end aligns
Give up those tragic desires
Eternal night
