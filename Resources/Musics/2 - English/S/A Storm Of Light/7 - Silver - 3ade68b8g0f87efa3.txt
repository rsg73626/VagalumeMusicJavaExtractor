SILVER

Silver memories
Of brilliant lies

Revive, capture
Distant lives

Sorrow had swept
O’er the land

Murdered by the sons
The innocents
Rivers run in blood
Lucent

Vale abandoned
Avarice
Clenched the sun
Hopelessness

Lone murderers
Of brilliant lives

We all cowered
To our own fears

Despair had crept
O’er the man

Murdered by the sons
The innocents
Rivers run in blood
Lucent

Vale abandoned
Avarice
Clenched the sun
Hopelessness
