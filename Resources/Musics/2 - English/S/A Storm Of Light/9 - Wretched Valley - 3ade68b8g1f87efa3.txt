WRETCHED VALLEY

Violent visions sear
Veins into the sky
Amnesia swarms this barren night

That lonesome valley
A welcome home
The darkness swoons
Never left here alone

Flames swarm as the stars descend
Falling through the seething sky
It seems we’ve met our final end
And we fear this last absolving rite

Scattered bodies lie
They hollow the earth
Amnesias swarm and converge

That wretched valley
A silent tomb
The darkness levied
Our fatal wounds

Flames swarm as the stars descend
Falling through the seething sky
It seems we’ve met our final end
And we fear this last absolving rite
