HARBOUR LIGHTS

You and I know I had to leave
And the harbour lights, I cannot see
But you were my rock never my stepping stone

I held my tongue, I turn on my heels
I couldn't look back
I want you to know
That you were my rock never my stepping stone

You were never a stepping stone

We both know I cannot come home
The water rose faster than I could run
All my love has bruised my grieving bones
Forgive my sins for I haven't found God
And I don't know when I can trust my heart
But you were my rock never my stepping stone

You were never a stepping stone
You were never a stepping stone

She said I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones

She said I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones

She said I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones

You were never a stepping stone
You were never a stepping stone
