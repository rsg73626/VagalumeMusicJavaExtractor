PARALYSED

I'm paralyzed
By the touch of your hand
I'm paralyzed
I am stuck where I stand
Before you walk away, please
Show me how to break out from these chains

[Chorus:]
I'm paralyzed
Hold still, we'll hear your voice
I'm paralyzed
I'm free, but I have no choice
I'm paralyzed
Closed mouth, want to pull in close
I'm paralyzed
Get me out of this horror-show
I'm paralyzed

I'm hypnotized
By that look in your eye
I'm mesmerized
I want to lay down and die
Before you turn away, please
Show me how to break free from this cruel spell

[Chorus:]
I'm paralyzed
Hold still, we'll hear your voice
I'm paralyzed
I'm free, but I have no choice
I'm paralyzed
Closed mouth, want to pull in close
I'm paralyzed
Get me out of this horror-show
I'm paralyzed

I'm paralyzed

Like a phoenix rising through the smoke
I am turned to stone
An eagle soaring high above
And I am down below

[Chorus:]
I'm paralyzed
Hold still, we'll hear your voice
I'm paralyzed
I'm free, but I have no choice
I'm paralyzed
Closed mouth, want to pull in close
I'm paralyzed
Get me out of this horror-show
I'm paralyzed

I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
