STRONG ENOUGH

With my head on your shoulder
You pour in my palm
Will life have a purpose
When you are gone?
Without your wisdom
And without your song
Will life have a purpose
When you are gone?

You're crossing an empire
But you're leaving my side
Did you find another love song?
We're sharing an atlas
We're both skin and bone
But I cannot go where you have gone

[Chorus:]
Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever I feel I've got it wrong
Whenever I fall you pick me up
Show me how to be strong enough

Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever I feel I've got it wrong
Whenever I fall you lift me up
Show me how to be strong enough
Show me how to be strong enough

Under the surface
I'm fooling no one
Life had a purpose
Before you were gone

You're crossing an empire
But you're leaving my side
Did you find another love song?
We're sharing an atlas
We're both skin and bone
But I cannot go where you have gone

[Chorus:]
Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever I feel I've got it wrong
Whenever I fall you pick me up
Show me how to be strong enough

Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever I feel I've got it wrong
Whenever I fall you lift me up
Show me how to be strong enough
Show me how to be strong enough

Big wheel turns
On an axle between
Mountains, all best wishes sweet
The tenacious dreams
And boulders of integrity
A thousand years old
Will one day be torn apart
From their loving neighborhood

[Chorus:]
Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever I feel I've got it wrong
Whenever I fall you pick me up
Show me how to be strong enough

Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever I feel I've got it wrong
Whenever I fall you lift me up
Show me how to be strong enough
Show me how to be strong enough

OOh, ooh
Show me how to be strong enough
You show me how to be strong enough
