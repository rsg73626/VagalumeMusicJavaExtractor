THIRTEEN TIMES THE STRENGTH

I am not the man I thought I was
I have tied a weight to my ankle bones
Now I take my wrongs to Davey Jones
And you can find a man with a better soul

I don't ever want to see a face like that
So I've left my clothes on the river bank
I don't want to face you with a heavy head
I've taken my body to the river bed

Sinking underwater
Fighting like a feather
Slipping underneath the world
This weight upon my shoulders
Crushing all my hopes
It's thirteen times the strength
Of anything I felt on earth

I am not the man I thought I was
Always let you down when you need me most
I am an American loading my gun
Pushing little children with plastic ones
