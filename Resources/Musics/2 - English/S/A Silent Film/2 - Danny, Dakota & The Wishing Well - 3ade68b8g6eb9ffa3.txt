DANNY, DAKOTA & THE WISHING WELL

In life you wish for a waterfall
In love you wait, you wait
You can walk away from the water, you could run away
You could start again with another
There's a setting sun where you once found you were in love

Danny met Dakota looking deep into the wishing well
Danny couldn't write so Dakota taught him how to spell
Dakota told Danny she was falling in love
But Danny couldn't speak when Dakota grew up
Dakota spent the summer chasing boys and smoking cigarettes
Her first tattoo was a violet on the back of her neck
Dakota left school when she moved down south
She never knew why Danny wouldn't open his mouth
So she (whoo) she ran away (whoo) from the wishing well

Danny got a job and he kept every promise he made
Dakota got married let memories slip away
Danny never wrote though he often cried
Dakota missed Danny but she didn't know why
Dakota found her husband in a hotel with her very best friend
She tried to make it work but she couldn't trust him again
Dakota moved back to the wishing well
But she never told Danny cause she couldn't tell
If he still (wooo) held a flame (wooo) for the love (wooo)
That Dakota stole whe she ran (wooo), away (wooo),
from the wishing well

(Go back, go back to the wishing well) 3x
(Go back, go back, go back)

Months went by Dakota learned where Danny could be found
Once a year he waited by a deep stone hole in the ground
Dakota found Danny where they very first met
She took his hand and she told her friend
"Don't let (wooo) me run away (wooo)
Again (wooo),  from the love we found when we met
(wooo) looking deep (go back, go back), into the wishing well"
