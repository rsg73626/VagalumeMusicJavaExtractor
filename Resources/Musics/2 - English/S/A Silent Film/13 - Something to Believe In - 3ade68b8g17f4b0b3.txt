SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN

Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day

I'm a flickering flame without your touch
I need something to believe in
Tomorrow is another day
In deep where the concrete to rush
I need something to believe in

I'm not waiting any longer
You give me something, something to believe in
I can't shout it any louder
So give me something, something to believe in
Give me something, something to believe in
Give me something, something to believe in

I'm floating on a wave in the atmosphere
Give me some other reason
Spiraling out, there's no doubt all along disappear
So give me something to believe in

I'm not waiting any longer
You give me something, something to believe in
I can't shout it any louder
So give me something, something to believe in
Give me something, something to believe in
Give me something, something to believe in

Tomorrow is another day, tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day, tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day, tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day, tomorrow is another day

I'm not waiting any longer
You give me something, something to believe in
I can't shout it any louder
So give me something, something to believe in
Give me something, something to believe in
Give me something, something to believe in
