FEATHER WHITE

Feather white in morning light you
Cut a shape in to the ice you
Walked out so far I could not reach you
I remember losing sight of you.

You, will all be sleeping with the fishes soon.

We got on well, did not argue
No alarm bell, no escape chute
But that morning you walked out so far
Through the ice fell into freezing water

(Policeman 1) 'We've got a young woman trapped under the ice in the lake, looks like she's been down there a couple of days'

(Policeman 2) 'Should I bring the axe?'

(Policeman 1) 'That's a negative, but bring a palette and easel, in twenty five years I've never seen anything so beautiful'

Days are long now, I hear you call me
Your fading heartbeats
Feather white in, you walked out so far
Through the ice fell, into freezing water
