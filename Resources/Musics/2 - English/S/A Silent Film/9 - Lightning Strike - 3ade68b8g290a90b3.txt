LIGHTNING STRIKE

Don't you leave me all undone
Don't you leave me in a foolish heap on the floor
Don't you leave me with the light on
Got a humming that I need your attention for
You've been getting me fired up
Then you ignore me while
you're fooling around with your friends
Don't you leave me on the back seat
Don't you leave me with my engine running again

Are you ready for the big show?
'Cause I've been waiting for it all of my life
I see a storm on the horizon
And are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?

Don't you leave me in the morning
Don't you leave me with this half-drunk bottle of wine
It's not a metaphor for what we have
Or a metaphor for what we could be leaving behind
I'm the stranger you befriended
On a night when you needed some warmth in your veins
Now are you ready to be needed
Are you ready for the hurricane that's heading our way?

Are you going to make your own choice?
Are you going to light 'em tonight?
Cause you're the storm on my horizon
And I am ready for the lightning to strike
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for the lightning?

Yeah, yeah
Are you gonna light 'em up tonight?
Yeah, yeah
I'm reaching out for you

I don't believe this is an ending
I don't believe it, with you standing in the pouring rain
You wouldn't dare to set the cliche
You wouldn't stop me
when I just got up the courage to say that
I am ready for the big show
I've been waiting for it all of my life
Don't treat your heart like a broken bottle
You can't make it with a loveless lover (?)

Are you caught up in your own voice?
Don't turn your back on me tonight
Cause I'm the storm on your horizon
And are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for
Are you ready for
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for
Are you ready for
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for
Are you ready for
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?
Are you ready for
Are you ready for
Are you ready for the lightning to strike?
