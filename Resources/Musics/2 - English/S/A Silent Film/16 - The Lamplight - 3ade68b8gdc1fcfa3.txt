THE LAMPLIGHT

I will always ask
I will always wonder
I don't need to hear the words
I don't need an answer from you

I'll always be here
I'll always want you to know
You are my lamplight
You guide me where I go

All my hopes - All my fears
Collide when, you are near

I don't want it all
We all guard our mysteries with a grin
Or write them in a song
Just enough to let the light in

All my hopes - All my fears
Collide when, you are near

Love is like a mast
That shivers at her mercy
These sails maybe tattered and torn
But she's not sinking easy
