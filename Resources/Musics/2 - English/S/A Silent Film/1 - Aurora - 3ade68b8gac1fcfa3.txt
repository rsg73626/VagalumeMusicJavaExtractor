AURORA

Aurora my love
Do not scrutinize
A slap on the wrists
Feels like soap to my eyes

Should a slip of my tongue
Be a bullet in your gun
Aurora my love,
I'm leaving

Aurora my love
You can tell me how to think
Like I am your patient
And you are my shrink

But the more you guide my hand
The less I'll understand
Aurora my love,
I'm leaving

Isn't it time you pushed yourself on someone else?
