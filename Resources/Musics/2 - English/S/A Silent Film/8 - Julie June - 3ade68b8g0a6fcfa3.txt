JULIE JUNE

Julie June come back to me
I'm not the man I used to be
Julie June I really miss you so
Tell me Julie June where did you go?

I washed the dishes and I cleaned the sink
I'm not as bad as your girlfriends think
I left my rifle with an old wishbone
I sit in corners when I'm on my own

Julie June I taste the tip of your tongue
I sing you songs that have never been sung
I am around you like a light on low
I am with you everywhere you go

I am the creature that crawls into your bed
I am the nightmare that fucks with your head
I am the cold and the creaky floor
I am the knife in your kitchen drawer

Maybe I know what you want; maybe I know what you need
Maybe we've gone too far this time, to taste the air we breathe?
Maybe I know what I want; maybe I know what I need
Come on back to my open arms
Give me the air I need to breathe

Julie June I know you've got my back
But I don't really want to see you like that
Still got the keys to my white mustang?
That silver chrome will bring you home
Come home
