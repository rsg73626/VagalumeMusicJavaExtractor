EVERGREEN

Be my evergreen
Wither orchids into winter
Above the fallen leaves
Float along the icy river

Evergreen, be a loyal friend til the story ends
Evergreen, find a mellow glow and the night is low
And we will grow

Be my evergreen
May the autumn strip your blossom
Share my revere
a heavy heart so softly broken

Evergreen, be a loyal friend til the story ends
Evergreen, find a mellow glow and the night is low
And we will grow

Deep roots in upon us
To never give up on the honest
We will grow
Evergreen in a forest
Grow deep roots in upon
To never give up on the honest
We will grow
Evergreen in a forest
We will grow, grow

Be my evergreen
Spring time makes me want no other
Carve your memory
Shame me as our vows grow older

Evergreen, be a loyal friend til the story ends
Evergreen, find a mellow glow and the night is low
And we will grow

Deep roots in upon us
To never give up on the honest
We will grow
Evergreen in a forest
Grow deep roots in upon
To never give up on the honest
We will grow
Evergreen in a forest
We will grow, grow
