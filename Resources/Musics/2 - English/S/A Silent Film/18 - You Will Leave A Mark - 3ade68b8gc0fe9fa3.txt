YOU WILL LEAVE A MARK

I am so ashamed 
I am so ashamed of all the trouble I have caused
and I am so ashamed of all these unopened doors 

I am so ashamed of what I have become 
That oh, my heart is bursting again 
Don't leave this mark 
your eyes are turning away 

I am of the west 
I am fair skinned 
I deserve a bullet in my chest 
If I have no religion and no reason to be scared 
If I am going to hell then I just don't care 

That oh, my heart is bursting again
Don't leave this mark
your eyes are turning away

That oh, my heart is bursting again
Don't leave this mark
Your eyes are turning away
