TO THE HEARTLESS

To the heartless your hollow hearts beat as one
look through these shadows there is hope in these dark days.
Born in the eyes of love
with every breath that we take this is what we've become.
In the darkest hours love is the light that sets us free
What if the end was the beginning and all thet we have done holds no weight there will be no time to change.
