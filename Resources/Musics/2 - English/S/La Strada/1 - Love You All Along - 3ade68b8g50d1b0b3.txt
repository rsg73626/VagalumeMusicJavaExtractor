LOVE YOU ALL ALONG

You take your refined animosity
And hold it up to the whole world to see
It can't make you happy
It can't make you happy

Hills rise and empires fall
Trees stand five thousand years tall
She can't make you happy
She can't make you happy

Birds fly over the rainbow
If you make it there do let me know
Meanwhile I'll be wishing you well
Down below

A new age dawns and old friends they go away
In the morning light I'm here for a day
Despite your wrongs I've come to say

You gave me the gift of a song
I know I ran but I loved you all along
It's you who make me happy
You make me happy
