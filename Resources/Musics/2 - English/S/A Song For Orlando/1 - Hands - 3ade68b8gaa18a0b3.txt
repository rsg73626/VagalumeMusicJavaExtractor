HANDS

Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start

Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb

Cus they can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

Ooh hands
Hands
Woo hands
Oh hands
Cus they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands
Change the world

Doesn't matter
Who you love
All that matters
Is you love

I've been watching news
And seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong
To want a little change

They can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

Ooh hands
Hands
Woo hands
Oh hands
Cus they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands

If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
OOh

Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start

I've been watching news
And seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong
To want a little change

Ooh hands
Hands
Woo hands
Oh hands
Cus they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands

If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
OOh
OOh

Just take my hand baby
Everybody's in love
(All that matters is your love)
(Change it or break it)
(They can love or they can take it, take it all)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
OOh
