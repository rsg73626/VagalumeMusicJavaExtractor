SHADOWED LINES

Suddenly it's dark
Thickening clouds approaching
Grayer than I've ever seen before

Then where stars have gone
New ones growing slowly
Glimmers reeling me toward the shore

But we know
None can go

Here we are
Boundary's near
Tempting us with freedom

Glowing shapes drawn clear
Features vibrant, blooming
Soothing as the clouds now disappear

Sunlight bathes the soil
Warming all surroundings
But this bliss can only last so long

No one wanders free
All get turned away

How can others
Claim this mother earth

Caged by you
I'm on the edge
I'm on the edge of truth
Here's proof
Your claims that conscious states
belong to you

All these lines we've drawn
Are bars of cells we've spawned

Let me through
I'm but a man
Just like the rest of you
Consumed
By arbitrary needs to rule this zoo

Comfort those employed
To hide what we exploit

Glowing shapes so clear
Features fully blooming
Free now that the clouds have disappeared

Sunlight floods the soil
Life's embraced my footing
Can't we just try keeping this around

Glowing shapes drawn clear
The shadowed lines blur with time, resign
Everything is mine to see
Exorcise mortal chains
So sail with me, no need to be afraid

How can others claim this
How can others claim this earth
