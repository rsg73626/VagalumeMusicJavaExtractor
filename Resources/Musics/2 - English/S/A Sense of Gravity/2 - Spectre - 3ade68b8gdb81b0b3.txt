SPECTRE

Frayed will fills ritual hourglass
Unsurprisingly time's slow but fast
My sharpened brushes wait to slice through
A bloodied portrait of you

I submit I'm alone
Transcending right and wrong
Convinced I'm imprisoned
By this flaw of mine
That sees no line

Night will drown my days
The onslaught feeds my craze

Kiss your god goodbye
Cause now your soul is mine

I cut through the issues in my mind
Continue to slice through all these lies

My tongue's grown numb
From lying constantly
Convince my friends
There's nothing wrong with me
I have just slid by

Conflicting thoughts create an entity
A long lost one that watches over me
Saves my hide

Frayed will tips ritual hourglass
Unsurprisingly my time has past
My flawless system hibernates through
A routine existence renewed

I submit I'm alone
Transcending right and wrong
Convinced I'm imprisoned
By this flaw of mine
That sees no line

Terror comes to life when evil's in my sights
Corrupt soul corrodes corruption once for all

I've cut through the issues in my mind
Continue to slice through all these lies
In review these issues stay alive

Trapped inside a fabricated life
Terrified to free a soul confined
Endlessly the mind refines its lies
Redefine this false design
End this fall
