LIFT OFF

Riding right besides me, lift off
Don't know where we'regoing, lift off
I don't want to crash  and die
You might think that is fine
But I want to survive
We're all floating away

I hope we all get saved some day
Get saved some day
Feeling all this panic, lift off
Not able to handle it, lift off
Don't kwow where my friends is, lift off
Get me the attendant, lift off
