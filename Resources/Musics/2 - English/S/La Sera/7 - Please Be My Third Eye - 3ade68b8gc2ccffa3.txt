PLEASE BE MY THIRD EYE

When you sit beside me
I can see much further
Than my own dimension
I can't wait much longer

Will you please be my third eye tonight?
Please be my third eye
I wanna see the light
Please don't leave me blind
I wanna share your mind tonight

I can feel your heartbeat
When my mind is clear
I can see your visions
There's nothing to fear

Will you please be my third eye tonight?
Please be my third eye
Please be my third eye
Will you please be my third eye tonight?
Please be my third eye
I wanna see the light
Please don't leave me blind
I wanna share your mind tonight
