NEVER COME AROUND

If you ever wanna call me from la,
I will simply tell you that I've gone away.
I can't handle hearing from you everyday.
So I'm just glad your ever tired of being ok

Ah ah

But you will never call me 'cos your never there,
I can finally see that you where never there.
If you ever call again, I'll have to tell you, I can't be your friend.

Ah ah

Oh oh oh oh

Driving 'round for hours, seaching for a clue.
Waiting to tell you I can't ever be with you.
So run back to her love, because it's over now.
Safe to say that baby never comes around
