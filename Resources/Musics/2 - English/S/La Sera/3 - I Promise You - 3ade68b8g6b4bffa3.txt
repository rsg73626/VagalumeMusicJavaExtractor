I PROMISE YOU

You're so far away from me now but it wont be long
In one months time I'll call you mine like I was never gone
I won't ever let you go, you'll get sick of me soon
I promise you
I'll write you a song a day until I get you back
Count the ways that I love you it's so hard to keep track
I won't ever let you go, you'll get sick of me soon
I promise you
