SLEEPTALKING

Act like you don't know what I'm talking about
You might think your sly but I know that it's out
I'm talking in my sleep and your hearing every word
I'm talking in my sleep, please pretend you haven't heard

I can't  take it back and I don't regret a think
It's coming from the heart even though it's threatening
I'm talking in my sleep and your hearing every word
I'm talking in my sleep, please pretend you haven't heard
