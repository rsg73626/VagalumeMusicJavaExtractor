DEVILS HEARTS GROW GOLD

Your heart grows gold as your devils grow old
And your not going to sleep till you find your soul, I know
You race through life and it causes you strife
But your not gonna rest till you find your best, I know
Devils hearts grow gold

You will find your soul
You've earned your keep but you're in too deep
You can close your eyes, life wont pass you by, no
You toil away working every day
You should take a breath, it's all you have left, no
