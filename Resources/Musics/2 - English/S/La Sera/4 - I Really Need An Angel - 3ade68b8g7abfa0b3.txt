I REALLY NEED AN ANGEL

Heaven help me, say a prayer for me
You don't love me, don't love me no more
We were money in the bank
Till the bank got robbed
Cruising easy street till the wheel fell off
Down on any street where the train stops stop
Hear them all crying for me
Hear them all crying for me

Heaven help me, I need an angel
I need a miracle
Cause I've tried all my luck in this world
I would do anything for you to love me
I need an angel, to love me, I need an angel
To love me, I need an angel

See what's left of me
Nothing but shreds to me
I'm way out to sea
You're the rising shore
The safest bet, no risk of a loss
Till the other foot dropped
Left to pay the cost
The mess you left is all I've got
Hear them all crying for me
Hear them all crying for me

Heaven help me, I need an angel
I need a miracle
Cause I've tried all my luck in this world
I would do anything for you to love me
Heaven help me, I need an angel
I need a miracle
Cause I've tried all my luck in this world
I would do anything for you to love me
I need an angel to go ahead love me
I need an angel, to love me
I need an angel, to love me
I need an angel to go ahead love me
