SHADOW OF YOUR LOVE (SLIGHT RETURN)

Stick to the stones, going with what you know
Came to me like a vision in the night
Pedal steel plays, like always
Are you with me now, have you ever been?
Pedal steel plays, always
Are you with me now, have you ever been?

Nothing grows
Nothing grows in the shadow of your love

Heading home, playing what I know
Came to me like a message in the night
I turn away, like always
Are you with me now, have you ever been?
I look away, always
Are you with me now, have you ever been?

Nothing grows
Nothing grows in the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love, shadow of your love
