REACH THE SHORE

Surrendering my heart
I'm surrendering my heart
One step at a time

Help me be the desperate
Help me be the loving
Destroy this feeling of being alone
Of being alone
My flesh is weak and my spirit is strong
My spirit is strong with you

I'll fix my eyes
"by the grace of god"
I won't get caught in this chaos
Where waves are like giants
"that can sink this ship"
Without you there holding me firm

Break
Break my heart
Take all of me

Break, break my heart
Take all of me
My mind is everywhere and I'm praying for your guidance

Adrenaline is the only thing
Keeping me focused
I've been turned around
So many times
You've calmed this storm
Now I can reach the shore

It is well with my soul
My heart it surrenders
