THE BEE & ITS SWARM

Our minds grow high with thoughts
That are branches over everyone
We have to make alters, we have to make alters
This city of sin has me convinced
I'm jaded to this
I have to make an alter, I have to make an alter

I have something here
Where are my eyes, where are my ears
Where are my eyes
I am a machine
I can't feel anything, I can't feel anything

Do I make you weak?
Do I make you question everything
My hour is coming it's coming I swear
Thank god my mistakes are covered by grace

I'll plead forgiveness
I'll be honest by lying to you
I've believed a liar
And I've built a wall to block my prayers from heaven
When all I wanted

Was to feel loved, was to feel loved

We will meet you here
The places we call home the places we fall short

I've lived inside of my head as a critic
I've tossed and turned all night
I've coincided my thoughts and actions
I've tossed and turned all night

This is the problem wait for it wait for it
This is the problem wait for it wait for it

You are the dammed

When all of this was meant to be for your glory
All of this was meant to be for your glory
