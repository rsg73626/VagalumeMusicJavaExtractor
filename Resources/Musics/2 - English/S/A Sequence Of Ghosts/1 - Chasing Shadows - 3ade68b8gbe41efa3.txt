CHASING SHADOWS

Lord, Lord, I can't make this fig tree wither
I can't make these mountain be thrown into the sea
I can't do this on my own

My flesh is weak
I will devour everything
The trend is nothing new to me
Lord fill me with something real
The shadows have kept me captive
They've kept me wanting so much more

Lord, Lord, I can't make this fig tree wither
I can't make these mountain be thrown into the sea
I can't do this on my own

This love I cherished has
Made my lungs gasp for a breathe
Your a liar your a fake
Lord fill me with something real these shadows have kept me captive
They've kept me wanting so much more

We are we are the ones who walk alone

We are we are chasing shadows
