THE ENABLER

Feel your own heart beat
I don't want to cover your casket
With all my questions
Feel your own heart beat
Don't let this end in unjust tragedy

What if this ends before it begins
Will our apathy be denied
Will it cause our sins
My pride's not the answer its the problem

There's such dramatic tension here
I've exhausted every option

We're all ghosts among ghosts
This life is short but still we stay close
We stay inside
We're addicted
We're slaves to this routine

We all are sinking ships
All we see is the surface
And the city lights floating by us

Look at the horizon
It's yours
Don't fear, don't fear

We'll watch the city lights
Float by us
Thinking nothing more of them
