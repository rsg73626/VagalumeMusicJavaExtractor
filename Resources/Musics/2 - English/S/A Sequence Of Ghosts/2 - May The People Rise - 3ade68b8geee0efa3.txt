MAY THE PEOPLE RISE

It's your pity that hangs by a thread
I can see right through you
Go ahead and blame this mess on me
We are terrified
We aren't healthy of mind

This sequence of events leads me to believe
That you did this for me
I gave in, I gave in and I bought it all

You told me once you told me three times I won't do this for you
Just to make me prove that this is what I want

I am all alone, I am lead by a ghost
I'll close my eyes and fall
Only to be caught by you
Why am I so full of doubt

This sequence of events leads me to believe
That you did this for me
I gave in, I gave in and I bought it all

You told me once you told me three times I won't do this for you
Just to make me prove that this is what I want

Silence is the most defining thing
You will hear
I'll close my eyes and fall

Silence is the most defining thing
You will ever hear
I'll conquer this sea of doubt
