YOU MAKE THIS EASY

i'll make this slow and deliberate
and i will tell you
all the things that i've always wanted to
about all the nights and the memories
you're so hard to please
and you know that i won't hesitate
to say anything

and you want to believe me
i can see you hanging
on every empty word i say

reciting words that i don't mean
but meant to say
maybe i'm running out of chances
but that won't change a single thing because
i know exactly
all the words you need to hear
you're so hopeless and desperate
