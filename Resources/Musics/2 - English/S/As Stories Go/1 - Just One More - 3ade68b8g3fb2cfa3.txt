JUST ONE MORE

The sun goes down
And once again it's time
To waste away the week
So well prepared
To remedy the memory
Of anything and everything

The glass
The poison
The way you turn into
The one
You hate
There's no stopping now

I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling weightless
Not a care in the world
You never know
Exactly when it is
You have gone too far

Just one more
There's always

Night after night
You are searching
For something you cannot find
So settle
For some temporary peace of mind
