BREAK

Feels like this, when I’m lying
Lego man, without eyes
Record shop, [...] street watch
Cheer him up anymore
I don’t lie, my life

Feel depressed when I’m laughing
And my friend, my own head
Seems too small to contain me
Have my thoughts [...] and
Turn away from her sails

I’m telling you
I’m gonna break you down [repeat 4]
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you break you down

All messed up, and out of town yeah
I can’t see another way
Always trying not to hurt her
I don’t know, all the things I say
Don’t make any sense

I’m telling you
I’m gonna break you down [repeat 4]
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you break you

And I don’t know what I want
And I really don’t care
‘Cause I never met anyone, who knew
Just what they want

I’m gonna break you down [repeat 3]
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you break you down
