LAVATORY LAMA

‘Cause of you
I laid in my bed staring at you
Watching when you [...] off
Well, yeah I’ll try
To work things out
To turn around

But if you won’t care
Then I won’t care
And if you won’t mind
Then I won’t mind
I won’t mind

You’re bugging me
You’re telling me it’s time to go
To our own
Get a different point of view
Well, yeah I’ll try
To work things out
To turn around

But if you won’t care
Then I won’t care
And if you won’t mind
Then I won’t mind
I won’t mind

I never wanted more
I never tried for more
I just kept all I had and went along

But if you won’t care
Then I won’t care
And if you won’t mind
Then I won’t mind
And if you won’t care
Then I won’t care
And if you won’t mind
Then I won’t mind
I won’t mind
I won’t mind
I won’t mind at all
