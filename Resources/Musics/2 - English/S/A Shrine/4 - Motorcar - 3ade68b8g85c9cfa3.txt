MOTORCAR

It has happened now
The thing that you swore that you’d never do
It has happened now
And it’s him again
And pop, you are down on your back again

Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And everytime she comes around
She uses you for her own ends

It’s your motorcar
She loves it when you drive her everywhere
But she won’t pay no

Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And everytime she comes around
She uses you for her own ends
Her own ends

But it’s never too far
Never too far
It’s never too far
To go by car

It has happened now
The thing that you swore that you’d never do
It has happened now
And it’s him again
And pop, you are down on your back again

Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And everytime she comes around
She uses you for her own ends
Her own ends
Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And every time she comes around
She uses you for her own ends
Her own ends

But it’s never too far
Never too far
It’s never too far
To go by car
