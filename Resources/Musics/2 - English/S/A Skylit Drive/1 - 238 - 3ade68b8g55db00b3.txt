When you go too far
Will you know who you are
Laughter lies to believe...
We're both the same
We have a harder new brain
What makes you different from me?

Wait up, I can run to you
Wait up, I
Wait up, I can run to you
Wait up, I
Wait up, I
Wait up, I can run again!
Wait up, I can run to you
Wait up, I!

From the graves you unburied
Wishing for a new... her...
Once every day go try
Where are you, supposed to know this time
Wished goodbye oh, relevant sky

Setting away plans he has for me...
Where will I go when I die?...

Wait up, I can run to you
Wait up, I
Wait up, I can run to you
Wait up, I
Wait up, I
Wait up, I can run again
Wait up, I can run to you
Wait up, I

From the graves you unburied
Wishing for a new... her...
Once every day go try...

Stop my show!
Shut my throat!
No, your right
Shut my, Shut my, Shut... My... !
Shut my throat!
No, your right!
Shut my, Shut my, Shut... My... !
Everything might like you (Everything might like you...)
Everything might like you... (Everything might like you...)

From the graves you unburied
Wishing for a new... her...
Once every day go try...

From the graves you unburied
Wishing for a new... her...
Once every day go try...

Please go home...
Go home!
Go home... !
(Home)
Now! Go home!
Go home...
