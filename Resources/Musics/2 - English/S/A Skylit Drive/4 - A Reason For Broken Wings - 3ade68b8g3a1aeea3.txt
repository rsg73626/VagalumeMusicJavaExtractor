A REASON FOR BROKEN WINGS

The battle loves to choose its fights
Collapse the sight of soldiers eyes
Bombs cascading over me
May my body rest in pieces

Spring mourning rain
Heal the wombs in me
On me
The battle is one
I'm now coming home

Spring mourning rain
Stitch me up with strings of symphonies

The battle is one
Close your eyes just dream
I'm not coming
Close your eyes just dream

Dream of me, lock inside your mind I'll hide
Scream my name, fell me breath along your thighs
Close your eyes just dream

Grasping of you're your sheets
Turn out the lights
Holding on to memories
Never felt so right

Shaking, Squirming

In your skin tonight
Oh my Marie, oh my Marie

This is a reason for broken wings

The battle is one
Close your eyes just dream
I'm not coming
Close your eyes just dream

Dream of me, lock inside your mind I'll hide
Scream my name, fell me breath along your thighs
Close your eyes just dream
