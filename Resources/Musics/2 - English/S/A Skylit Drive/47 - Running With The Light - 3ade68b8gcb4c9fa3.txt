RUNNING WITH THE LIGHT

You brought this on my head... It's calling me
You sent me to my death... I figured out why
You can look into my lies but never...
You could never turn back all the clocks to take back what you did to me

Go and find your own way
Hey! Don't turn around
Is there anything left to believe in?
Go and find your own way
Hey! Get out of this town

Don't even blink
Your time has run out
Spill your guts all over the ground
Don't even blink
Your time has run out
Catch your breath
It's all over now

An infinite control shoots my body away from the soul
And now you see how I feel
You've been down this road too many times
All the streets run together

The goal of this game is to live in the night
I've never seen you frightened like I see you
I might just make this the day that everything is
okay

To take back what you did to me

Go and find your own way
Hey! Don't turn around
Is there anything left to believe in?
Go and find your own way
Hey! Get out of this town
Don't turn around
Get out of this town
