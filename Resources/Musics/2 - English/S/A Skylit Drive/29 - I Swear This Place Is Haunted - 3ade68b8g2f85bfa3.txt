I SWEAR THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED

Is there something beyond science going on here?
In the dead of fear
Rise up willingly and confront us
This is the last winter
Part of a change for better

I'm moving forward now
The thought of a ghost brought me to life
I'm moving forward now
Turn all of this white
The creature at night
You said it would never find out where I rest my head at night

Let us be the ones who block out the sun
Light projects through myself

What have I done to deserve this?
What have I done?
I have learned of the virus
We are above this

It's our time to rise
We've built this it's ours
It's our time to rise
Build it up. Break it down. We built this it's ours

I'm moving forward now
The thought of a ghost brought me to life
I'm moving forward now
Turn all of this white
The creature at night
You said it would never find out where I rest my head at night
