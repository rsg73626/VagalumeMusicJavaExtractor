THANK GOD IT'S CLOUDY CAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO SUNLIGHT

I found a lot in this life
Never did I mention that it wasn't my intention
To inhale/exhale
The part of you
That is...
Take it or leave it
Time repeats itself

In every mirror I see myself in the same way
Reflection's half of it, but living's the price I pay
Seeing this face can cause a bit of disarray
All I ask of you is.... stop

The stage is set to arrive here my dear
The floor clears
It's not as it appears
I spent this time alone in my mind
A super model suicide

I deserve an explanation not a consequence for the offense that I have committed
Your reflection is so much different in motion

In every mirror I see myself in the same way
Reflection's half of it, but living's the price I pay
Seeing this face can cause a bit of disarray
All I ask of you is.... stop

The stage is set to arrive here my dear
The floor clears
It's not as it appears
I spent this time alone in my mind
A super model suicide

I feel that you have been caught in my appeal
I feel that on this night we are for real

Stop...

The stage is set to arrive here my dear
The floor clears
It's not as it appears
I spent this time alone in my mind
A super model suicide
You will never know
