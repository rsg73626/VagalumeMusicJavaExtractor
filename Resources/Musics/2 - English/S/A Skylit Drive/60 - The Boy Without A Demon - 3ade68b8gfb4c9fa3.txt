THE BOY WITHOUT A DEMON

What is that name on your lips?
Is it from the other side?
Don't lie.

As the weather sheds its worst rain
It marks the December when I left here pale and alone
Her last breath gave in so fast
She led me to believe she was the one for me

I am coming for you
You can run but you cannot hide
I am coming for you

Now you've made a mess out of things, and I can't live with this on my mind

I never wanted this
Now I'm alive
Do you like my style?
I can see my breath, and your heart's so cold

You call this parody a plan but you're so wrong
I'm here your majesty to serve when you call upon
I'll spare your oath and let you righteously live on
Don't act like something you're not
Do you feel at home?
Your flames are burning higher
Your circumstance is dire
Don't panic. You're frantic
This is your hell
Dancing for something that was true to you
How do you do?
Say it's me.

But that wasn't true.... was it?

Now you've made a mess out of things, and I can't live with this on my mind

What is that name on your lips?
Is it from the other side?
