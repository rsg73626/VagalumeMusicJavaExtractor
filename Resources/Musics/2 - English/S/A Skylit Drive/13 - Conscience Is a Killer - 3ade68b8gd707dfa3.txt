CONSCIENCE IS A KILLER

You finally got me
I am your heart attack
Hey beautiful deadly, I have seen you before
This crime is undone

Shh, be still and I'll keep you always
Trust me, you will not feel a thing

Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight
I'm onto you
Survive the way that you're made to
The conscience killer always gets away

The stage is set for the collapse
Let's face the truth and stop pretending
You kill to prove, you are one of us
But truth be told you are better than all of us
This crime is undone

Shh, be still and I'll keep you always
Trust me, you will not feel a thing

Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight
I'm onto you
Survive the way that you're made to
The conscience killer always gets away

Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight
I'm onto you
Survive the way that you're made to
The conscience killer always gets away

Tied up, barely conscious
Awaiting to see what's going down
Instead of fighting you said you're on your own
It's better that I go
I may be blinded
The change is proof we've grown
It follows me where I go
Instead I'm looking back to where we met
I found my chance to live again
Instead you'd rather see where we end
The conscience killer always gets away

Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight
I'm onto you
Survive the way that you're made to
The conscience killer always gets away
Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight
I'm onto you
Survive the way that you're made to
The conscience killer always gets away

So I guess this is goodbye
I will meet you on the other side.
