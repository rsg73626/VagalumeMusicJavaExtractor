SEE YOU AROUND

What if you could go back?
What if you could go back?
Erase me
I'm a figment of imagination

I know you can hear me
I know you can see me breathing

That place where I knew that I could find you
I think I'll make a run for it
And if I don't find you there
I'll search forever

I don't see you upside down
I'm outside of my body
Oh my, why are you inside out?

That place where I knew that I could find you
I think I'll make a run for it
And if I don't find you there
I'll search forever

And if I don't see you there
I'll see you around
