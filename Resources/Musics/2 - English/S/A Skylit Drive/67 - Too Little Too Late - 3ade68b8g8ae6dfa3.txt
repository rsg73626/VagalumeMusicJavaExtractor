TOO LITTLE TOO LATE

You crowd around me on the floor
Staring in deservance,
Seeing what I'm fighting for
It's not in you, not like this
I'm only seconds away from giving in

And I'm running out of time
Now I'm running away to free my mind
My mind...
It's so like you,
In discretion is all you can be
Screaming to see what is in between

I've been to hell and back,
The quiet never lasts
It's not like you to take a risk
I'm only seconds away from giving in

And I'm running out of time
Now I'm running away to free my mind
My mind...
With only seconds to go
Cause we'll end this world
With only seconds to go,

Come drop the kill!
Reject the world that is broken
Don't give in!
The time slips through our fingers
It slips away...
Reject the words that are spoken
Don't give in!
The final hour will linger
Too little, too late
Reject the world that is broken

Don't give in!
The time slips through our fingers
It slips away...
Reject the words that are spoken
Don't give in!
The final hour will linger
Too little, too fucking late
It's too late..
It's too late..

The time we spent is free..
Gone away..
Thrown away!
I'm only seconds away from giving in
And i'm running out of time
Now i'm running away to free my mind
My mind...

With only seconds to go
Cause we'll end this world
With only seconds to go,
Give up the kill!
Reject the world that is broken
Don't give in!

The time slips through our fingers
It slips away...
Reject the words that are spoken
Don't give in!
The final hour will linger
It slips away...
