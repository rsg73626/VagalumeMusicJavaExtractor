FALLEN

A fire burns within me
Never ending
Keeps me close enough
The quickness kills the cold in us

We see the shit you do
I'll never be like you
You'll never folow through
Let's make our move

Destroy them all

You are so hollow empty and cold
Will you follow even if i'm fallen?

Give it up
We're not giving up

We're not afraid of what consumes you

The quickness kills the cold in us

Destroy them all

You are so hollow empty and cold
Will you follow, follow me under?

You won't bury me not this time


The fallen
You won't bury me not this time

The fallen

We will rise again
We believe
We were meant for something more

Rise

We believe
We were meant for something more

What's left to fight for?
What's left to fight for?
What's left to fight for?
What's left to fight for?
What's left to fight for?

You are so hollow empty and cold
Will you follow even if i'm fallen

You are so hollow empty and cold
Will you follow, follow me under

You won't bury me not this time

The fallen

You won't burry me not this time

The fallen

You won't bury me

You won't bury me

You won't burry me not this time

The fallen

You won't bury me not this time

The fallen

You won't bury me not this time

The fallen
