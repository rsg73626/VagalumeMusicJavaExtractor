DROWN THE CITY

Lie to me
I wont lie
Tape your mouth shut
Lie to me
I wont lie
Swallow your tongue

Forget it all i have you buried in my walls
Ill use your skin to cover up my scares

The place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
The ropes that tied your hands right by your side
The place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
The ropes that tied your hands right by your side

So now your screaming at the top of your lungs
Hoping for someone to come
Hoping they’ll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.

I wont die i will lie
The only problem with the story carved on your chest
Is its hard to read when your missing your ribs

The place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
The ropes that tied your hands right by your side
The place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
The ropes that tied your hands right by your side

So now your screaming at the top of your lungs
Hoping for someone to come
Hoping they’ll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.

I wont die i will lie
The only problem with the story carved on your chest
Is its hard to read when your missing your ribs

So now your screaming at the top of your lungs
Hoping for someone to come
Hoping they’ll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.

So now your screaming at the top of your lungs
Waiting for someone to come
Hoping they’ll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you

Immerse me cut my throat
If you want me skin deep you better act now
