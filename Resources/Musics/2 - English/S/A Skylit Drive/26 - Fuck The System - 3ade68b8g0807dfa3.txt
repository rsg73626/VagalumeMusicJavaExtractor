FUCK THE SYSTEM

The world is not in your hands
Fuck the system
A systematic position
We?ve lost our minds
Oh, how we love it
Give it to me, give it all to me
Give it all you?ve got, give it all you?ve got girl
Give it to me, give it all to me
Keep up with me
Lay back and let go

Collision course on ignition
I?ve lost my decision to take me home
I?m just a little bit closer to find?
I?m just a little bit closer to find that all I wanted I had
I?m on a collision course on ignition
I?ve lost my decision

The world is not in your hands
Fuck the system
A systematic position
I?m blacked out, and spun out, and I love the way it?
I love the way it feels
I don?t feel at all
Keep up with me
Lay back and let go

Collision course on ignition
I?ve lost my decision to take me home
I?m just a little bit closer to find?
I?m just a little bit closer to find that all I wanted I had
I?m on a collision course on ignition
I?ve lost my decision
I?ve lost my decision

This is for my brothers and sisters
This is for the misguided and alone
We are the chosen few 
The ones who know you
Rise as one
We are the ignition
Stay true to let go
Open your eyes
You?ll find a world ungrateful
Stay true to let go
Open your mind to a world unfaithful

Collision course on ignition
I?ve lost my decision to take me home
I?m just a little bit closer to find?
I?m just a little bit closer to find that all I wanted I had
I?m on a collision course on ignition
I?ve lost my decision, I?ve lost my decision
On ignition, on ignition.
