THE CALI BUDS

What is friendship
This is friendship
This is for my friends
This one's for my cali buds

California I'm waitin' for ya

We stand tall
I said it's time you believe in
All in all
I said it's time you believe in me
We play such different roles
I caught on to you, caught on to you

I hope you're ready, I hope you're ready
I hope you're ready for the fall and what's to come
We smash ourselves
Live fast and break it all for the ones
Stand by me through all we see
I know we live fast and break it all
California I'm waiting for you

We stand tall
I feel free to be a little uncertain
All in all
I'll never know what tomorrow brings
I can only hope I'm as alive as tonight

I hope you're ready, I hope you're ready
I hope you're ready for the fall and what's to come
We smash ourselves
Live fast and break it all for the ones
Stand by me through all we see
I know we live fast and break it all

We crash and put ourselves back together
We crash and put ourselves...
I'd fight for you, I'd kill for you
I know, I know we say "I'd fight for you, oh God I'd kill for you"
We say, we say "There's a part of me that's in you" 
"A part of me that's in you"
We say, we say "I never thought that you'd be on your own"

I hope you're ready for the fall and what's to come
We smash ourselves
Live fast and break it all
Stand by me through all we see
I know we live fast and break it all
Live fast and break it all
Live fast and break it all
I hope you're ready for the fall and what's to come
I know we live fast and break it all
California I'm waitin' for ya.
