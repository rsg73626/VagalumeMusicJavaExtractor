I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD

I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I must be dreaming
I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I'm barely breathing
I'm suffocating

I'm caught in a web. I'm spinning
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I'm twisted
Am I awake or dreaming? If I'm alive and breathing
Until my heart stops beating
Until my lungs burst I'm screaming

Until these words lose meaning

I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I must be dreaming
I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I'm barely breathing
I'm suffocating

Am I even awake? I'm awake in my head
Am I even awake? I'll sleep when I'm dead

Am I awake or dreaming? If I'm alive and breathing
Until my heart stops beating
Until my lungs burst I'm screaming

Until the end
Until these words lose meaning

I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I must be dreaming
I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I'm barely breathing
I'm suffocating

Until the end
Until my lungs burst I'm screaming
Until the end
Until these words lose meaning

I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I must be dreaming
I've been awake for days
I'll sleep when I'm dead. I will never give in
Disconnected. I'm barely breathing
I'm suffocating
