IF YOU LIVED HERE YOU'D BE HOME

Like it was before our?
Time to be lifted to a place that I can?t remember
Disconnect your mind
You won't, you won?t remember

All attention to the countdown
Time slips through an hourglass
It seems to be such a perfect ending
(It seems to be such a perfect ending)

Thank you for what you brought out of me
And I know that I?ll be with you till the end
So long, the life we lead
I?ll keep you close to me
Thank you for what you brought out of me
And I know that I?ll be with you till the end
So long, the life we lead
I?ll keep you close to me

Now it?s time to be lifted to a place that I can?t remember
Disconnect your mind
You won't, you won?t remember

You?re not a desire
You?re what I need
I want you to levitate
Sing with rapture through the day for me

Thank you for what you brought out of me
And I know that I?ll be with you till the end
So long, the life we lead
I?ll keep you close to me
Thank you for what you brought out of me
And I know that I?ll be with you till the end
So long, the life we lead
I?ll keep you close to me

You brush the lines
You tell it in the eyes you?ve stolen
And you break, and you break
You cut a million times
Cut a little bit
Now you won?t forget me
Cut a million times
Cut a little bit
You won?t forget me now
You won?t forget me
You won?t forget me
Cut a million times
Cut a little bit
You won?t forget me
Cut a million times
Cut a little bit
You won?t forget me
You won?t forget me

Thank you for what you brought out of me
And I know that I?ll be with you till the end
So long, the life we lead
I?ll keep you close to me
Thank you for what you brought out of me
And I know that I?ll be with you till the end
So long, the life we lead
I?ll keep you close to me

You brush, you brush
You cut a million times before it?s done
I never liked this side of you
And you break, and you break
You tell a million times
You tell a million times before it?s done
I never liked this side of you
And you break, and you break.
