OBLIVION

Hold on to the end
Never change who you are

I will run till the air escapes my lungs
What we do won't be undone. Fade away, oblivion
I will run to the end to be no one
Fade away, fade away, fade away, oblivion

You never try. You never know

We'll shake the earth to be heard
Encrypted vision is blurred
The end of me, the enemy
Collide within me
This is the moment of truth
The reverie that we pursue
You're either on your knees
Or you're neck deep in your dreams

Hold on to the end
Never change who you are

I will run till the air escapes my lungs
What we do won't be undone. Fade away, oblivion
I will run to the end to be no one
Fade away, fade away, fade away, oblivion

Fade away
