400 (FEAT.ROBOTS)

Could this be real?
Corrupted secrets inside
That will eat you all alive
They were all wrong
They're all alike
Infected degenerates
Like poison in my mind
We light the candles and turn out all the lights
Power to a clinical paradox
It's time to break out
Hello to LA nights
San Francisco will be shut down
We wait in silence
Speaking in whisper
They walk like giants that will swallow the ocean
Take your stand right here, right now
We will break you, we'll break you down
Because in the end your fate is what you make
Could this be real?
Corrupted secrets inside
That will eat you all alive
They were all wrong
They're all alike
Infected and corporate
Like machines, they're sent to die
We light the candles and turn out all the lights
Power to a clinical paradox
It's time to break out
New York is not so bright
San Francisco will be shut down
We wait in silence
Speaking in whisper
They walk like giants that will swallow the ocean
Take your stand right here, right now
We will break you, we'll break you down
Because in the end your fate is what you make
When I see a future that's afraid I close my eyes to thing of a better day
A chapter closed
The story goes on and on to turn the page
A story on and on to turn the page
We wait in silence
Speaking in whisper
They walk like giants that will swallow the ocean
Take your stand right here, right now
We will break you, we'll break you down
Because in the end your fate is what you make
When I see a future that's afraid I close my eyes to think of a better day
A chapter closed
The story goes on and on to turn the page
A story on and on to turn the page.
