HEY NIGHTMARE, WHERE DID YOU GET THEM TEETH?

Run, for your life now
Don’t you see your princess is gone?
Pull your vengeance aside
Let’s make it rain blood tonight

Collide your sword with mine, I’ll send your soul
To the hell where it came from
Be this I know you’ll never set your eyes
On a quest you can’t survive
It’s no surprise that your head hangs
From my heads your mouth can’t sin or lie

Cut threw the limbs 
Stab threw the enemies eyes
Any last man will die

She, watching the sky burn oh how it burns
Run for the skylines run for the skylines darling
Follow the light of the moon just stay alive

Forgive me
For tomorrow
If I’m late
I’ll died before I wake

Cut threw the limbs 
Stab threw the enemies eyes
Any last man will die

What’s left for you
You wanted life
I showed you love
Conserve protect your life

Your life is my well being
And if lay in shadows then so be it
But left it be known that this soldier will not rest a day
Until he lays in the glamour and the grace of his bride
I will not rest one day until my victims blood is shed up
And down the shorelines

For gods sake please
Don’t you forgive me
I will wait for you
Race the sun
Pray for nothing warm
