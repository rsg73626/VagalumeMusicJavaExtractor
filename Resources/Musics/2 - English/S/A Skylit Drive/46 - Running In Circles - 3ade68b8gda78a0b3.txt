RUNNING IN CIRCLES

Look ahead and don't turn back
Take the highway. I'm not coming back
Round and round on a one way track
I'm not coming back. I'm not coming back

I said you'd never get it right
You said if only for tonight
It was ours for the taking
But for now we are breaking

I'm not coming back. I'm not coming back

Running in circles
Going round and around
You've got your heart on your shoulder
No wiser no older

Through the night till the stars go black
Into the morning sun. I'm not coming back
Been around on a one way track
I'm not coming back. I'm not coming back

I said you'd never get it right
You said if only for tonight
It was ours for the taking
But for now we are breaking

I'm not coming back. I'm not coming back

Running in circles
Going round and around
You've got your heart on your shoulder
No wiser no older

Walk away and shut the door
Silently looking for
All the reasons I need to leave
All the reasons we're not meant to be

There's no turning back
Straight into the sun
I'm not coming back
It's over and done
Fade into the black
I'm set on the sun
I'm not coming back
It's over and done

Running in circles
Going round and around
You've got your heart on your shoulder
No wiser no older
(It's over and done)
