IDENTITY ON FIRE

Identity is on fire
I?m afraid I am the one you know
Connect your soul with mine

My heart will explode
Or is this all in my head?
Wipe the sweat from my eyes
I?m killing myself from the inside out

I?ve seen this place before
Reach for the chemical
I can hear you screaming,
But I can?t make out the words

The worst is yet to come
Send me an angel
Face to face with my worst enemy
You never got me in this way
You never f*cking got me in this way
The worst is yet to come

Set aside the pain
Contradict your disillusion
I never thought it could get this far
Below the surface
Through the dead
Will I ever reach it?

Wipe the sweat from my eyes
I?m killing myself from the inside out

I?ve seen that look before
Reach for the chemical
I can feel you breathing
And I need this just once more
How did I end up this way?
Oh my god, how the fuck did I end up this way?
The worst is yet to come
Send me an angel
Face to face with my worst enemy
I don't even know what I've become
The worst is yet to come

Set aside the pain
Contradict your disillusion
I never thought it could get this far
Below the surface
Through the dead
Will I ever reach it?

You are my chemical (You are my chemical)
Send me an angel (Send me an angel)
You are my chemical (You are my chemical)
Send me an angel (Send me an angel)
(You are my chemical
Send me an angel
You are my chemical
Send me an angel)

Set aside the pain
Contradict your disillusion
I never thought it could get this far
Below the surface
Through the dead
Will I ever reach it?

Wake up and say; You?re not alone, you?re not afraid
Wake up and say, ?I?m not alone?
Wake up and say; You?re not alone, you?re not afraid
Wake up and say, ?I?m not alone, I?m not afraid.?
