THE SON IS NOT THE FATHER

Do you feel medicated?
Do you feel separated?
It's not like you ever tried
It's not your time
It's like this life swallowed you whole
Into the great unknown
Into the darkness alone

It's not like you ever tried
You let the sickness inside
You left us all behind

You didn't even try to survive
You didn't even care. You left us all behind
You didn't even care. You didn't even try
Too young and too soon

It's not like you ever tried
You let the sickness inside
You left us all behind

I don't mind. You're separated
Your time is running out. Too far to turn back now
I never got to hear you say I'm better off this way
I never got to hear you say, I never got to hear you say

You didn't even try to survive
You didn't even care. You left us all behind
You didn't even care. You didn't even try
Too young and too soon

I will find peace of mind
So whenever I see you again
I can forgive you but I won't forget that you didn't mean to stay
I never got to say it's okay
It's okay

I never got to say it's okay
Too young and too soon

You didn't even try to survive
You didn't even care. You left us all behind
You didn't even care. You didn't even try
Too young and too soon

Too much to let go of the past
Too young to surrender what we had
Too young and too soon
Too much to let go of the past
Too young to surrender what we had
Too young and too soon
It's not like you ever tried
