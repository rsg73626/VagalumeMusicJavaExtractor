LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
In my windpipe

I can't breathe, but I still fight
While I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight

High of the love
Drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint
And I love it the more that I suffer

I suffocate and right before
I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it wait

Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't
Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again

It's so insane
Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind at his back
She's Lois Lane

But when it's bad
It's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude

I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you

Even know what hit them
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get them

Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at them
You swore you've never hit them
Never do nothing to hurt them

Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom and these words
When you spit them, you push
Pull each other's hair

Scratch, claw, bit them
Throw them down
Pin them
So lost in the moments

When you're in them
It's the craze that the corporate
Controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know ya
Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over

It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playing over

But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game

But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine

But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded

Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems

Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away though

Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk

Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies

I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'mma tie her to the bed
And set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
