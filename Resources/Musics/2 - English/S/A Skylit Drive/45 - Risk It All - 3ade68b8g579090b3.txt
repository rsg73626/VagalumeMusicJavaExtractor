RISK IT ALL

Fire rages in me
Never want to see the roses on your door
Glasses separates our touch
Soaring into the unknown skies fearing
what we're fighting for

This is a war we cannot win!

Our last time to make stars collide right before our eyes
Believe in everything
Everything you've ever known
Reciting words we lost
These years will never be untold
I won't be alone

Fire rages in me
Daylight fights through the night
with the cries of redemption
The sun ignites the light in our eyes

And is this possible!

Our last time to make stars collide right before our eyes
Believe in everything
Everything you've ever known
Reciting words we lost
These years will never be untold
I won't be alone

This time we fight
Side by side
You and I
This time we fight
Side by side
You and I

The bringers of light
The teeth in the night
The teeth in the night
The bringers of light
The teeth in the night
I won't be, won't be alone
