SYMPHONY OF BROKEN DREAMS

It's everyday that I can't close my eyes
It's everyday it seems I'm asking why
You had to leave me wishing every time
When I sleep you'll be somewhere far away from me

Sinking, I'm falling through
Lost in the depths of time
Silence enfolds me
Cut up and left behind

You were the light in the dark
You were the end from the start
Like waves in the ocean you bury me
We in this moment depart
Replacing all that we are
A symphony of broken dreams

You couldn't mean it if you even tried
You couldn't see it. Now it's do or die
I found the meaning when I said goodbye
Between misery and despair. Motionless in fear

Sinking, I'm falling through
Lost in the depths of time
Silence enfolds me
Silence enfolds me
I'm lost in the depths of time
Cut up and left behind

You were the light in the dark
You were the end from the start
Like waves in the ocean you bury me
We in this moment depart
Replacing all that we are
A symphony of broken dreams

I've made my mistakes. My life on the strings
Composing a symphony of broken dreams
I've lost all my faith. My humanity
Composing a symphony of broken dreams

You were the light in the dark
You were the end from the start
Like waves in the ocean you bury me
We in this moment depart
Replacing all that we are
A symphony of broken dreams
