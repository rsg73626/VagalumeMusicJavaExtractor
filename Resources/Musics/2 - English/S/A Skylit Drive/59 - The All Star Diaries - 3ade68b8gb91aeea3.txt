THE ALL STAR DIARIES

Why you so scared?

I am a non worthy sinner
Still I pray for
When will you be the star in the sky for me
All eyes on you

Sing a song for me
Sing it tell you see my face
Lay your trust in me
I’ll be your remedy note

Scrambling to shut the door
Leave the cold wanting more
Scrambling to shut the door
Leave the cold wanting more

Embrace your mind
Set it free
Remember everything you lost

Have a seat in my car
Will take the 99 north past three
Am where still breathing now
I’m now leaving are you so scared
Recline the seat back lets drive
North tell the sunrise

Why you so...
I’m not leaving from this parade tell I die
Why you so scared
Why you so scared

With your hands on me
I’ll keep my eyes on you
I’ll promise to be
A little secret that will pull you threw
Secret passage threw the weight of the world

Why you so,
I’m not leaving from this parade tell I die
Why you so scared
Why you so scared

Hands at my side oh will I live or die
I will strong
This is my life
Threw open eyes
This is my life
Threw open eyes
Why you so scared
