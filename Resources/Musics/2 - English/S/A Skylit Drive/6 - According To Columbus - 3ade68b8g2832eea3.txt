ACCORDING TO COLUMBUS

Save me
The skin that's stretched across your bones
The scent that lacks the innocents i know
Cold front coming, like blisters threw your pores
Breathing you'll trust me darling
I'm the sword inside your stone

The rest of your life
May it rest in my eyes
Let me show what is like

Meet me, at the skylines
I'll wait for you to go
I'll wait for you to go
Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you to go
I'll wait for you.

Save me
The skin that's stretched across your bones
The scent that lacks the innocents i know
Cold front coming, like blisters threw your pores
Breathing you'll trust me darling
I'm the sword inside your stone

The rest of your life
May it rest in my eyes

Meet me, at the skylines
I'll wait for you to go
I'll wait for you to go
Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you to go
I'll wait for you.

Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you
Meet me at the skylines
Meet me meet me
Meet me at the skylines
Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you

I don't think you know
What these words mean
I don't think you know
What we could be
I'll wait forever cause i think your the one.
