WITHIN THESE WALLS

You'll never last with bones built like glass
Can you hear me now?
If ever for the sound
Can you hear me now?
I've always had my doubts

I know you think this is the last time you'll hear my words
But you'll never stop this bleeding heart
If ever for the sound
If ever you were proud
The times you let me down
No I cannot take this
No I can't take this anymore

You live a life where everything is about you
Corrupt the system that you'll never amount to
How do you sleep at night with one foot out the door?
If it were up to me I'd watch you as you leave
The light in me burns brighter than it ever has before

This is the end of an era
You're already gone
They'll drag the lake just to find your heart
This is the end of an era
You're already gone
We'll sever the ties as we live for more

I know you think you drew the line so give me your worst
If there's any concept, a rhyme or reason
I've always had my doubts
If ever you were proud
The times you let me down
No I cannot take this
No I can't take this anymore

You live a life where everything is about you
Corrupt the system that you'll never amount to
How do you sleep at night with one foot out the door?
If it were up to me I'd watch you as you leave
The light in me burns brighter than it ever has before

I think it's time for you to see this through
I won't carry you anymore
No I cannot take this
No I can't take this anymore

You live a life where everything is about you
Corrupt the system that you'll never amount to
How do you sleep at night with one foot out the door?
If it were up to me I'd watch you as you leave
The light in me burns brighter than it ever has before

The light in me burns brighter
