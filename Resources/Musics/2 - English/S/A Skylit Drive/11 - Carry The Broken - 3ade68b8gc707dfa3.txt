CARRY THE BROKEN

We are the lost, ones unspoken
We are the few, who carry the broken.

We are the lost, ones unspoken
We are the few, who carry the broken.

We are the lost, ones unspoken
We are the few who carry the broken.

We are the lost, ones unspoken
We are the few who carry the broken.

We are one above the sun
We are one above the sun
We are one above the sun
We are one above the sun.
