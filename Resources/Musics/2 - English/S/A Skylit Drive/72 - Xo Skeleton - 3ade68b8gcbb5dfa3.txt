XO SKELETON

It seems perfection is made up
You’re lying to yourself and I want more
And I’m calling you out, I’m calling you out
Time won’t be here that much easier
And I’m calling you out, I’m calling you out

A part of me says in some way I’m guilty
Higher, suspended and wired
Bury yourself, unworthy
Take it from me you’re better off not knowing
The things you wish you could see
You won’t know, you won't know

I’ll show you just what it’s like to be invincible
You know you’re not invisible
Just static over the airwaves
You know I’ve blown your cover
This wouldn’t last forever
I’ll show you what it’s like to be invincible 

It seems perfection is made up
You’re lying to yourself and I want more
And I’m calling you out, I’m calling you out
Time won’t be here that much easier
And I’m calling you out, I’m calling you out
You’re broken 

So you’ll see what matters most, what matters most
So you’ll see you’re just a ghost, you’re just a ghost
Take it from me it doesn’t get much easier
Take it from me you’ll only get what you deserve
You’ll never know

I’ll show you just what it’s like to be invincible
You know you’re not invisible
Just static over the airwaves
You know I’ve blown your cover
This wouldn’t last forever
I’ll show you what it’s like to be invincible

You’ll see what matters most
You’re just a ghost, you’re just a ghost 
You’ll see what matters most
You’re just a ghost, you’re just a ghost 

I’ll show you just what it’s like
Breathing, gasping for air
I’ll show you what it’s like to be breathing and dead
I’ll show you just what it’s like
Breathing, gasping for air
I’ll show you what it’s like

I’ll show you just what it’s like to be invincible
You know you’re not invisible
Just static over the airwaves
You know I’ve blown your cover
This wouldn’t last forever
I’ll show you what it’s like to be invincible

You’ll see what matters most
You’re just a ghost, you’re just a ghost
You’ll see what matters most
You’re just a ghost, you’re just a ghost
