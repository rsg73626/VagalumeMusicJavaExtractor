SHOCK MY HEART

All I see is the violence
It follows you to your grave
All I hear is the silence
of my heartbeat

It's like I'm falling from a rooftop
waiting till the doctors arrive
Shock to my heart
I'm on the edge of my last breath
Reaching for the stars in the sky
Give me a reason to try
Shock to my heart
Shock to my heart

It's biochemical defense
Coursing all through my veins
All I hear is the silence
of my heartbeat

It's like I'm falling from a rooftop
waiting till the doctors arrive
Shock to my heart
I'm on the edge of my last breath
Reaching for the stars in the sky
Give me a reason to try
Shock to my heart
Shock to my heart
Shock to my heart

Shock to my heart
Shock to my heart

It's like I'm falling from a rooftop
waiting till the doctors arrive
I'm on the edge of my last breath
Reaching for the stars in the sky

Give me a reason to try

Falling from a rooftop. Falling from a rooftop
Shock my heart

It's like I'm falling from a rooftop
waiting till the doctors arrive
Shock to my heart
I'm on the edge of my last breath
Reaching for the stars in the sky
Give me a reason to try

It's like I'm falling from a rooftop
waiting till the doctors arrive
Shock to my heart
I'm on the edge of my last breath
Reaching for the stars in the sky
Give me a reason to try
Shock to my heart
Shock to my heart
Shock to my heart
