THE CHILDREN OF ADELPHIA

Lights out!
Can you see the end?
Don't think you have nothing to hold
We are the motion
You are the tide

Our time has seen its last success

You will not go til you find your way home

The ground beneath me is burning, 
and I say let it die... let it die
Stuck in time we're frozen, 
and I say let 'em die...
let 'em die

We are the children of Adelphia

We can't breathe in all this smoke

First to the sea
Then to the sky
It's beautiful I know you'll like it

We are the motion
You are the tide

You will not go til you find your way home

The ground beneath me is burning,  
and I say let it die... let it die
Stuck in time we're frozen, 
and I say let 'em die...
let 'em die

We are the children of Adelphia
We are the motion, and you are the tide
