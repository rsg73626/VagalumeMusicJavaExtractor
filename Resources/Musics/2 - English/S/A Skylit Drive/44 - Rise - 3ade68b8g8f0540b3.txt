RISE

Some days I feel like a loaded gun
I paint a target on everyone
Get off your knees cuz I'm telling you
What's done is done

What will you do?
Will you run?

You think you're running away
I think you're running in place
Run
I've never seen you this way

Do not pray for an easy life
Search for the strength to walk the line
I see a hope that's hard to find
So don't run away
Away

Some days I feel like I'm fucking done
I'm waging war against everyone
It's killing me like it's killing you
What's done is done

What will you do?
Will you run?

You think you're running away
I think you're running in place
Run
I've never seen you this way

Do not pray for an easy life
Search for the strength to walk the line
I see a hope that's hard to find
So don't run away
Away

This ends tonight

Do not pray for an easy life
Search for the strength to walk the line
I see a hope that's hard to find
So don't run away
Away
