FALLING APART IN A (CROW)DED ROOM

Shut down and reignite

I spit out what I breathe
Through the dust and decay
I can't touch what I see
A reflection of me
Disengage the machine
Let the light fade away
Through the ash in the streets
As we fall into the grey

Into the fray
Take me away
Into the grey

I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room

You can choke on your greed
You can swallow the plague
I won't buy what is free
You're the one that will pay
In the land of the free
And the home of the fake
We're consumed by disease
As we fall into our graves

Fall into our graves
Fall into our graves

I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room

I can't let you go

Shut down and reignite
We are the dust that whispers
Ash from a fire inside
Death on the wind. We whisper

I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room

I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
We're face to face yet stand alone
I'm just a slave of a life split in two
Falling apart in a crowded room

I shouldn't stay but I can't let you go
I can't let you go
