SELF/LESS

I break my neck for you, I bend space and time
I break my back in two till blood fills my eyes
And if I die, you wouldn't mind
I would leave it all behind
And if I die... I leave it all behind

You've got your knife to my throat, I wouldn't hesitate to... wait until you cut me through
You've got the bare hole I'm staring into
Should I pull the trigger for you?
Let me mention, this is for you!
I die for you
I die for you!

I break my neck for you, I bend space and time
I break my back in two till blood fills my eyes
And if I die, you wouldn't mind
I would leave it all behind
And if I die... I leave it all behind
Yeah, I'd be fine

Yeah, I'd be fine! I don't mind!
With your noose around my neck
Yeah, I'd be fine! I don't mind!
With your barrel to my head
Yeah, I'd be fine! I don't mind!
That I'm hanging by your thread
Yeah, I'd be fine! I don't mind!
That you're blaming me inside

I'd die for you. I'd die for you!

I break my neck for you, I bend space and time
I break my back in two till blood fills my eyes
And if I die, you wouldn't mind
I would leave it all behind
And if I die... I leave it all behind
Yeah, I'd be fine
Yeah, I'd be fine

And if I die, you wouldn't mind
I'd leave it all behind
And if I die... I leave it all behind
Yeah, I'd be fine
