FIND A WAY

There's nothing left to hide. I failed before I tried
Cut me open. I'm not staying
I fall apart inside. I'm running out of time
Reach me before I stop breathing

I'm running out of time

We will find a way
We will find a way
And when there's nothing left to say
we will find a way
We will find a way

Where is my self control? You've taken all I've known
You take everything and leave me with nothing
Into the void I go. Forever the echo
Over and over. Feels like we're stuck on repeat

Stuck on repeat. Over and over

We will find a way
We will find a way
And when there's nothing left to say
we will find a way
We will find a way

You never want to talk about what you think about. What you have right here
It never was enough for you. It's all for you
I never thought I'd see the day. I'm at my darkest place. Are you happy now?
Are you fucking happy now?

We will find a way
We will find a way
When there's nothing left to say
I will find my way

No, it never was enough for you
No, it never was enough for you
