EX MARKS THE SPOT

This is when your heart stops!

Aren't you just dying to be here?
Lose yourself, lose yourself, lose yourself
Light this direction
March on the the wicked one
Light this direction
I saw you for what you're not inside
Who do you think you are?
I won't be with you
Who do you think you are?
I won't destroy myself 
Not for you
Found such a perfect way to lie
You said you found a better taste than God
Tell me what you see
Look at me!

You found a secret
You?d kill it just to keep it
Believed you and what you say
I never thought you?d find a way
You found a secret
You'd kill it just to keep it
Believed you and what you say
I never thought you?d find a way

Aren't you just dying to be here?
Yeah!
Lose yourself, lose yourself, lose yourself
This is when you heart stops
I caught myself at the scene of the crime
What could I have done to get this far?
What could I have done?
Displaying lines unquestioned
I'm fighting just to do what is right
Enclosed and shaking
I can tell you?re breaking
So break in
Tell me what you see
Look at me!

You found a secret
You?d kill it just to keep it
Believed you and what you say
I never thought you?d find a way
You found a secret
You'd kill it just to keep it
Believed you and what you say
I never thought you?d find a way

I?ve seen the best in you
(I?ve seen the best in you)
For what it's worth
I'm consumed and confused by the truth

When the day is done
When the day is done

I'm playing this one close to my chest
I?ll never let go
Say you?ll never let go
Stealing a part of me
And claim it was the best
I'm playing this one close to my chest
I?ll never let go
Say you?ll never let go
Get on your knees
And show me how you please

This is when your heart stops!

You found a secret
You?d kill it just to keep it
Believed you and what you say
I never thought you?d find a way
You found a secret
You'd kill it just to keep it
Believed you and what you say
I never thought you?d find a way

The moments get slow
The further you go
I'd pull you close but never show
I?d kill it just to keep it
The moments get slow
The further you go
I'd pull you close but never show
I?d kill it just to keep it
The moments get slow
The further you go
The further you go
The moments get slow
The further you go
I'd pull you close but never show
I?d kill it just to keep it
The moments get slow
Whoa and you know
I?d killed it just to keep it
Don?t you know?
Don?t you know?
I?d kill it just to keep it.
