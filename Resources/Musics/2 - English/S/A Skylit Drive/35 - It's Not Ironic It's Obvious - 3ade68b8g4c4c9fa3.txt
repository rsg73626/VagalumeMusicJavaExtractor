IT'S NOT IRONIC IT'S OBVIOUS

Wander alone
Seeing is believing
Not without a soul to hold me flat on the ground
I meant every word I said

You are the one I've been looking for
Wanting more
I'm all alone in this
What part of that did you miss?
That will not last

Hey you, I am the one you've been running from
But I know they don't know that maybe I was meant to live this way
In a love struck kind of way

Follow me into the void
Excuse me, do I even know you?
No you don't, no you don't
Get a grip, oh my god get a grip
On what? on what?

The final piece that I need is that spark in your eye
Where did it go?

My own disguise is right in my sights
We learn we breathe
The sky hears my plea

Hey you, I am the one you've been running from
But I know they don't know that maybe I was meant to live this way
In a love struck kind of way
In two dimensions always

I've been living in the light of the world
Even you can't change me now
