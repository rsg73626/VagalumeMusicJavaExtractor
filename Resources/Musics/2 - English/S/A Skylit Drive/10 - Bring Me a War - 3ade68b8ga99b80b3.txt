BRING ME A WAR

Are you a soldier?
Stand up and raise your fist
I'll fight forever
Until the end

Bring me a war
A glimpse of before vanishing quickly
We'll make them believe the blood that we bleed sets us free

Bring me a war

You're not alone now
Stand up and raise your fist
We are forever
Until the end

Bring me a war
Failure is fleeting
A glimpse of before vanishing quickly
We'll make them believe the blood that we bleed sets us free

Bring me a war

Skies will come crashing like never before
We're everlasting
We'll make them believe the blood that we bleed sets us free

Bring me a war

Are you a soldier?
Stand up and raise your fist
I'll fight forever
Until the end

Don't let your fears guide your sins
Let them in

Bring me a war
Failure is fleeting
A glimpse of before vanishing quickly
We'll make them believe
The blood that we bleed sets us free

Bring me a war

Skies will come crashing like never before
We're everlasting
We'll make them believe
The blood that we bleed sets us free

Bring me a war
Are you a soldier?
Stand up and raise your fist
