TEMPT ME, TEMPTATION

What are you waiting for?
Salvation is my name
Take me for who I am
Sit back and bite your tongue
Shut the f*ck up
I beat you once before, and I?ll beat you again

What of you has been the same?
You leave me drained and bound
Buried beneath until I rise above
Sing to me
You leave me drained and bound
For the last time

You turn me on
It?s in the way you move (in the way you move)
You turn me on
It?s in the way you move (it?s in the way you move)
I am consumed by you
I?m drowning on the floor
We?ve done this over and over again
It?s dark where I?m going
I?ll wave as I descend

What of you has been the same?
You leave me drained and bound
Buried beneath until I rise above
Sing to me
You leave me drained and bound
For the, for the...

What of you has been the same?
You leave me drained and bound
Buried beneath until I rise above
Sing to me
You leave me drained and bound
For the last time

Drowning on the floor
And I know that this time it feels alright
Drowning on the floor
And I know that this time it feels alright
Drowning on the floor
And I know that this time it feels alright
Drowning on the floor
And I know

What of you has been the same?
You leave me drained and bound
Buried beneath until I rise above
Sing to me
You leave me drained and bound
For the, for the...

What of you has been the same?
You leave me drained and bound
Buried beneath until I rise above
Sing to me
You leave me drained and bound
For the last time

And I swear to you that on day I?ll be gone
This time it feels alright
And I?m turning around again
Oh I know it feels alright
And I?m turning around
It?s in the way you move
Make me move
And I swear to you that one day I?ll be gone.
I'll be gone
And I swear to you that one day I?ll be gone.
I'll be gone
And I swear to you that one day I?ll be gone.
