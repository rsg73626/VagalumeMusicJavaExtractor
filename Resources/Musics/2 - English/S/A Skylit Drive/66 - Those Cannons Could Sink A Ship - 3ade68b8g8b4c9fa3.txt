THOSE CANNONS COULD SINK A SHIP

I'll find you out
Replacements are overrated
It's been said once or twice now
Silently we reach the day
The secret's out now
With your eyes in the back of your head
Can you see it's me?
And I will find a way to hunt you down
I'll go to every niche and corner of this town

I won't stop until the bleeding all has run out

Remember what you said about being a friend now?
The movement in her hips strikes the hour when the poison sets in
How do you wake?
How do you sleep at night?
Remember what you said

I know where you are
Plan your escape
Do exactly as I say
Some odd years now... comply
Fight for your chance at life
They'll never find out where I buried you

I will force you to sit upright with access to your heart
Now is your time to plea
Say it, "set me free!"
Set me free

Remember what you said about being a friend now?
The movement in her hips strikes the hour when the poison sets in
How do you wake?
How do you sleep at night?
Remember what you said
