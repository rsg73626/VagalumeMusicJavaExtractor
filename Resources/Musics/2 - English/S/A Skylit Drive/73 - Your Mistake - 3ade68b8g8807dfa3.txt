YOUR MISTAKE

I?ll show you places that you cannot go
That you cannot hold
It reminds me of being in my head
A few steps from being alone
Not to place the blame on you, but this is what you do

Take a few steps back, and you?ll see
I wanted you to be near
Let your body leave
Let your body turn itself inside out
Let your body leave
This reality isn?t enough for me now

You?re not the last one, but you?re on top of me now
I?ll never miss a thing when you believe

Turn your back away
We can be angels above the sun
A few steps from being alone
You sold your soul to be the one
Oh, God, what have we done?

Take a few steps back, and you?ll see
I wanted you to be near
Let your body leave
Let your body turn itself inside out
Let your body leave
This reality isn?t enough for me now

You?re not the last one, but you?re on top of me now
I?ll never miss a thing when you believe

Don?t you tell me about the times
Don?t you tell me about the lies, oh all the lies
Don?t you tell me about the times
I admit to you, I was used like you
I?m a liar and you already knew it
Knew it would be like this
And you give and you give when I take
Take it and run
Let me be your mistake, and turn your back away

You?re not the last one, but you?re on top of me now
I?ll never miss a thing when you believe
You?re not the last one, but you?re on top of me now
I?ll never miss a thing when you believe

Don?t you tell me about the times
I?ve heard enough from you now
Don?t you tell me about the lies, oh all the lies
I?ve heard enough from you now.
