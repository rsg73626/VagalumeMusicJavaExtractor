500 DAYS OF BUMMER

Smash it at all away.
Take it to your grave.
I'll keep your heart beating. (I'll keep your heart beating)

Set your clock to the right time,
So you'll know when I'm gone.
Go easy.
I swear, I swear,
I swear I'm not quite myself.

You'll die just to stop them.
Never know what it feels to be side by side.
You'll die just to feel like you're in.

I see the look on all your faces,
And you are telling me to run, telling me to let go.
I never thought I'd see this side of you.
Feeling lost in it, like it was last June.
Last summer shouldn't be over.
Why can't it last forever?

Set your clock to the right time,
So you'll know when I'm gone.
Go easy.
I swear, I swear,
I swear I'm not quite myself.

I'll live to live
Never know what it feels to be side by side
I'll live to feel alive

I see the look on all your faces,
And you are telling me to run, telling me to let go.
I never thought I'd see this side of you.
Feeling lost in it like it was last June.
Last summer shouldn't be over.
Why can't it last forever?

I see the look on your face (look on your face)
And you are telling me to run, telling me to let go.
Smash it at all away.
Take it to your grave. (Take it to your grave)
I'll keep your heart beating (I'll keep your heart beating).

This is our last chance (this is our last chance). Right now.
I'll keep your heart, I'll keep your heart beating

You'll die just to stop them.
Never know what it feels to be side by side.
I'll live to feel alive.

I see the look on all your faces,
And you are telling me lies, telling me to let go.
I never thought I'd see this side of you.
Feel it lasted like it was last year.
Last summer shouldn't be over.
Why can't it last forever?

I see the look on all your faces, (your faces)
And you are telling me, telling me, telling me to let go.
I never thought I'd see this side of you.
Feeling lost in it like it was last June.
Last summer shouldn't be over.
Why can't it last forever?

Why can't it last forever?
Why can't it last forever?
Why can't it last forever?
