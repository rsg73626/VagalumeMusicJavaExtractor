THE AUTUMN DISPOSITION

scents spill out into the air
depression takes the lead
fallen leaves turn brown
when they once were green
images of summers fun
slowly fade away
when autumn comes
i'll dread waking every day
the autumn falls to me
disgracing presence
this jacket won't keep me warm
the sky at night turns an eerie red
like lashings of blood
flowing from the dead

this disposition of autumn
is a time in which i grieve
visions of what is to come
make me want to leave
images of summer's fun
slowly fade away
when autumn comes
i'll dread waking every day

the sky at night turns an eerie red
like lashings of blood
flowing from the dead
tracing the patterns through a fallen leaf
deprivation through defeat

take
this pain
away
from me
and break
depressions lead
at night
no light
save that from the stars
time after time
remember autumn scars...
