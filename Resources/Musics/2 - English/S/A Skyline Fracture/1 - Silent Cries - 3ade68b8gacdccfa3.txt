SILENT CRIES

focus
on one thing at a time
no infection of the mind
conforming
it plagues you
just each and every day
there must be a reason
never will i try
for insignificance or lifelessness

and i know this
is hard to understand
leaving truths with shaky hands
disguising ignorance
as constructed innocence

but my intent is to be finally at one
and discover my true being
look around each corner
as paranoia overtakes

we sell our lives away
to afford what we'll never need
the pursuit of happiness
now on sale at malls near you!

silent cries of you screaming in my mind
thoughts of what makes you weep

lives
can be torn
as quickly
as they're born...
