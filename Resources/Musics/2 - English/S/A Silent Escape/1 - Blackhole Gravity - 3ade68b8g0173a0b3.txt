BLACKHOLE GRAVITY

So listen brother, sometimes you're like fuck that!
Why even bother, when there's nothing but
Your tainted perfection, illusion and tale
You're not an exception, just stuck in the jail

The total abcence of joy is not a slap on the wrist
If you're moving too fast you'll get hit by the fist
And while grasping for air you reason with your despair
Leading to a conclution of which you're not aware

Just one more day, you swear on your soul
Just one more timeyou want out right now
But it's sucking you in, yeah it pulls you in like a black hole

But I don't know, are you different?
Just like any other day gravity will affect you, (you're no different)

And you're, just not alive, you're not alive and there's nothing to it

The total abcence of joy is not a slap on the wrist
If you're moving too fast you'll get hit by the fist
And while grasping for air you reason with your despair
Leading to a conclution of which you're not aware
