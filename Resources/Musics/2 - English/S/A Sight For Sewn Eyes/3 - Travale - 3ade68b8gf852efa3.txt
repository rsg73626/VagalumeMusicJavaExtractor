TRAVALE

Reborn
In a world that fell apart
Rebuilt
By the hands of the few
This song may be
Dumb and naive,
But it wont change the outcome
Of the lost
And the outlawed.
Lets get this show on the road.
Clear your lungs and get in,
I swear ill be your fucking escort.
I'm a wealthy one,
I can spare
A little bit of pocket change.
Hijacking the limousine
Breaking and entering
Routine.
There aint' no getting sick of this
Rou.tine.
It fell apart.
Now we must rebuild
From the fucking start.
But it doesn't matter anymore.
Clear your lungs.
Get in,
Or get out.
Clear your lungs.
Get in,
Or get out.
I swear I'll be your fucking escort.
I swear I'll be your fucking escort.
Well because
This song may be
Dumb and naive
I know now,
This road may be long but
I'm in.
