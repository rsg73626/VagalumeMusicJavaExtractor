YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW

Oh.
This one it stings like hell
More than ever be,
More than ever before.
Well, I gave it my all
But it led to
It led to
It did
My downfall,
My downfall.
This is all I've wanted
All I needed
It's all I've needed
Well I know
I'll need a new outlook on things
But ill
I'll have to refrain my body from needs
And my necessities
And you
Don't want to know
What I'm capable of.
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
But I will shine through
But not today, not today.
Oh.
Well this is the end of
Everything.
Everything.
Everything.
