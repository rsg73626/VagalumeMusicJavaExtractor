DEAD'D

It winds and turns,
It will make you sick to your stomach,
Mean while the binds that hold you down
Release you to a small quiet town.
Watch the world go by,
Watch the world go by.
Watch the world go bye,
It's the best way to spend my own time
On this black ribbon.

Hold your breath,
It will only last moments.
Keep your head up from the water,
Keep your head up from the water.
Now...
Exhale and let it start again.

Keep looking straight,
Don't stray away,
Keep your head on a swivel.
Don't, don't look back
Keep pushing....
Forward.
Forward.

If I could travel all over the world,
I'd never see a beauty like this.
That's where you can find me.
I can always find a way home,
But why would I want anything else?
As I said keep your head up from the water.

With my eyes set straight,
I know that I can take whatever this road
Holds for me, holds for me and you.
I know I've found my place.

I feel so sorry,
But I have to give into
What I want too
And truly desire.
It's nothing against you,
I've just changed.
I've just changed.
I've just changed.
