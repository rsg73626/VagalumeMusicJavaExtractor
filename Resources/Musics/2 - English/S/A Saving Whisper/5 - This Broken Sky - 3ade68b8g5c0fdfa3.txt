THIS BROKEN SKY

Stop this mess don?t you see....
It?s killing you every night....
Wake up wake up....
Your skin has  nothing to do with art....
It?s just the evidence that you need help....

I will help you enlight your horizon....
Clap your hands to the beat of the drama....
Cry out your eyes and dance to forget....
I hope you woun?t fail with your task of getting clear....

Stop your disorder, start your reserves....
Clean up this mess, breath some fresh air....
Stop your disorder, start your reserves....

Stop this mess don?t you see....
It?s killing you every night....
Wake up wake up....
Your skin has  nothing to do with art....
It?s just the evidence that you need help....
I will help you enlight your horizon
