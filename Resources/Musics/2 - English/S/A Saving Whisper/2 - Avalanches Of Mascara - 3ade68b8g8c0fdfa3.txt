AVALANCHES OF MASCARA

Taste your skin, it’s wasted like your dreams....
Taste your breath it’s fresh and attractive....
Distractive distractive destractive it makes blind....
Your cold your lovesome, I feel so damn betrayed....

Scratching on your surface will show me who....
You really are now, don’t hide yourself....
What happened to your beauty in the times....
Will you tell me that....

Your lonely I’m handsome, let’s have a dirty night....
Don’t lie to the world, showing it your seamy side....
I don’t want to black out all of your reputation....

Have you ever asked yourself what drives you this direction....
You could have been a better person but you took the path....
Of admidartion and you’re fighting for your credits every day.....

What is allright....
Why did you hold on....
You need no help now....
Drop your mascara....

Your fashion says fuck me ....
But I can’t see you behind yourself....
I can imagine, that you don’t understand....
The time you spend in front of the mirror is wasted....
Is that your dress or slept your fashion for some weeks....
You took the path of admiration....
You’re fighting for your credits every day....

Lost your soul....
Dress like you want....
What, what is it for?....
I don’t fucking know....
Just for a tip....
What are the words again?....
Whore, thats the word....
Drop your mascara....
That’s how we fucking do it
