ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURES

Break the Walls in your head
And find out whats your problem
With the storm in my lungs
The strom in my head breaks down
The walls in my head
The problems I had a cleared
So lets begin with inspiration

The storm came over yourself now
And broke the walls inside your head
And when I wake up everything seems broken
Everything seems broken

It felt so bad

Stop reading in your book
Stop wasting time
Whats the time between your sparetimes
And shatterproof is defenseless
There's nothing left to loose
Its the time to make up yourself
Imagination is the Curse

Dry your eyes, the world is not your child
This is the curse of the truth I denied, It broke my neck and took my job
What is the sense of life I live for? can someone stop the time for me?

Abstract Architectures
Built by a hurricane

Make your head a safer place
Build a wall to shelter from
Lonlieness
Pathetic rythm
Imagination emerges an leaves you alone
Leaves you all alone

I'm not so overdramatic
But this time its the last time
I'm thinking that life's fucking
Turning better when we cry
I try to concentrate
But my head is so gone!

Stop reading in your book
Stop wasting time
Whats the time between your sparetimes
And shatterproof is defenseless
There's nothing left to loose
Its the time to make up yourself
Imagination is the Curse

Find the way out
Out of my head
Find the way out of my head
