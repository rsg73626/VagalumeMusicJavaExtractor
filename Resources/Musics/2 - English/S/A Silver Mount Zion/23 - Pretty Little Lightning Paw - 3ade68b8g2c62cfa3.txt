PRETTY LITTLE LIGHTNING PAW

To fix it all with lightning paw
Or explode from joy and life
To break the bars with piss and scars
Just hold me 'neath the tumbling stars
And tell me it's alright

Lightning paw
Pretty little lightning paw...

There is a valley all swimming in light
There is a wonder in worry in life
There is a reason and there is a light
There is a valley all buried in light

There is a reason and beauty in life
There is a wonder and there is a light
The wind in the trees and the tumbling light
The whispering stars in the clouds tonight

Lightning paw
Pretty little lightning paw...

Free born
All our children
Free born...
