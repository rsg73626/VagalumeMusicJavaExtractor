MOVIE (NEVER MADE)

on silver mount zion
all buried in ruins
we was dancing the hora
until we vomited blood
spinning like crazy
Shoshanna i was jonesing
the towers had fallen
and the wind called out my grandfather's name 

let's kill first the banker
with his professional demeanor
let's televise and broadcast the raping of kings
let our crowds be fed on tear gas and plate glass
'cos the people united is a wonderful thing 

I know that you're dying
and I know I'm unwell
and together we sashay
through variations of hell 

and as you walk through valleys of fear
the lure of my past never near 

oh, don't be afraid, for the parade
will not pass our way
it's nobler to never get paid,
than to bank on shit and dismay
