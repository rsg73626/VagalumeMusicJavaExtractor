1,000,000 DIED TO MAKE THIS SOUND

One million died to make this sound
Can't learn the words if you don't know the feeling
Can't get the feeling if you don't know the sound
One million died to make this sound
Your band
Your band is bland
Your band is bland ambition

Can't live on their remainders
We'll starve on it for sure
Their way is debt and prisons
They are burning half the world
A feast of filthy feasts, man
Stale air and dead parades
The pretense of their awful gardens
Monuments the mess they've made
Give me a goddamn shovel
I'll dig my own damn hole
We drank 'til morning made us
Then ate the shit we stole

I learned it / at 17 / on drugs / and well policed /
It kissed me / as I fell / with fists full / of ringing bells /
So get fast / and get quick / with dum hearts / and swung hips /
Our dreams / deserve it...
