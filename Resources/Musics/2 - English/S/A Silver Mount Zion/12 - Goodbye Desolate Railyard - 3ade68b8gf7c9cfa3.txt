GOODBYE DESOLATE RAILYARD

It's rolling

So goodbye lovely train tracks
And goodbye broken trees
The devil poured his concrete
'Cross all our empty fields
From shadows across our sunrise
And sand beneath our wheels
So goodbye lovely warehouse
And goodbye sleeping weeds
Your beauty was a shining thing
That fell away from me

Everybody gets a little lost sometimes...
