THERE IS A LIGHT

Blown to waste, the starlight
Pale as the morning falls away
The devil reached on
And flat raised upon
Were torn asunder, 'neath his gaze

So come on ye' children,
If there's one thing we know
It's that those gathering clouds
Are swinging low

So don't you be precious
And man don't you be meek
There ain't no dim glory
In the long retreat

Don't carve the flight
Satellites on us
And we're building a tower
There's so many of us
No making of light
There's so many of us
Now weak on the prowl
There's so many of us

Ain't no truth but the known truth, but the known truth, yeah
Ain't no fruit but the known fruit, but the known fruit, yeah
Ain't no fall but the long fall, it's a long fall, yeah
Ain't no way but the true way is the dim light, yeah
But I've the light on, and been longing for the light
To fall all over me

Six and six parson, and he doth proclaim
That the best little bits of us misfits and strings
Making light in the night the means to be saved (ashamed?)
All for one unto all and done fall all in the same

And now we fall, and we go down and down
And our wings like fists, like wings on a cloud
And the one step, the two step, the three step we lead
And show me the lightning now

And there is a night
And there is a light

Yeah, shit is bleak, I've seen it and worried
Timid leaves get lay deep and buried
Entire wings wanna swim
I can barely write

Electrical fence, tantrums and prayers
Bright on those, but must they repent
The pits of this toss the axe to it and start again

The absence of night is its own stubborn light
No light is alight, no light is the true light
There is no light

Done weeping tonight
So we're choking on light

Tell me there is a light
Oh, tell me there is a light
