BLIND BLIND BLIND

Dust in the mouths of our wanderers
A promise that we'll never quit
So drunk though our hands are closely woven
Entire fleets of staggering ships
Now our ships lie in the floors of the ocean
And the oceans bleach on the rich
And the terrifying dreams of our wanderers
That once lit our way and now hid
We want punks in the palace
Â‘Cause punks got the loveliest dreams
And our gang is liquored and lovely
And smart and sweet and lame
And burn with a curious flame
That spits and kicks and shines
And trumpets play for
Of awakened dreams
Fly high
Some times there's an
(Are true)
Abandoned baby
(Some hearts are true)
Who claims to help
(Some hearts)
Powers the province
(Are true)
Of impotent pricks
(Some hearts)
There ain't no arguing
(Are true)
But Sometimes there is
(Some hearts)
Policemen in parallel lines
Blind blind blind
The broken bonds of quivering pints
While empty waters rise
May the light of our stridence still shine
Blind blind blind
May the light of our stridence still shine
May the light of our stridence still shine
Love the horse
