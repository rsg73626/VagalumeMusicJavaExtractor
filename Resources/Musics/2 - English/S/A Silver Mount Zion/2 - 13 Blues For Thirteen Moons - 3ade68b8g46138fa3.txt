13 BLUES FOR THIRTEEN MOONS

Blackout at the terror trials
It's the 6th year of their wars
I'm pacing shotgun hallways while my fucking neighbour snores
But I swear I hear them cannon 6 miles out from shore
There's ravens in the gun trees
There's ravens in the gun trees
There's ravens in the gun trees
There's ravens in the gun trees
Singing Â“this one by proxyÂ”
Singing Â“this one by gunÂ”
Singing Â“this one in waterÂ”
Singing Â“this one in the mudÂ”

I live by the railroad
I don't get no sleep
Four corners resplendent
With indie rocks creeps
I just want some action
I just want some action
I just want some action
I just want some action
I just want some action
I just want some action
This bright boy's getting old
This town is too damn cold
I just want some action
I just want some action
I just want some action
I just want some action
No heroes on my radio
No heroes on my radio
No heroes on my radio
No heroes on my radio

The ec'nomics of our trembling selves
The palsied pit where bad hearts yell
Let it be done. Let it be soon...
13 blues for thirteen moons
You're gold of heart
And golden wings are lashed upon your troublings
This filthy moat
In which we swim
Is not our fate
These stubborn limbs
These open hands
These wicked winds
The hearts of birds keep on thundering
Let it fall down. Man, let it be soon...
13 blues for thirteen moons

In gated chambers
They did meet
With cardboards stocking
Upon their feet
And tattled long
Their tattered road
And none did ease
No others load
The leaden lips
Of spittled gloom
Where leaders lunch
On meat and ruin
And depth light
Have long been truant
While our nation shores
Go on bleeding into
The ocean...
Let it fall down. And let it be soon...
13 blues for thirteen moons

The hangman's got a hard-on
The pretty minstrells sway
The pundit reeks of coffin
The banker rapes a maid
The hangman's got a hard-on
The pretty minstrells sway
The pundit reeks of coughin
The banker rapes a maid
