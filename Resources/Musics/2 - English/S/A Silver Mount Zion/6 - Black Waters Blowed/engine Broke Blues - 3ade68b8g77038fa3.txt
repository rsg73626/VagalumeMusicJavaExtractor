BLACK WATERS BLOWED/ENGINE BROKE BLUES

I found a penny where the black waters blowed
A dagger, a crown, or home in the snow
And scraps, soil, and sentries for the children below
There's one that are liars & ones that don't know

There's one that are shattered & ones that get saved
I will not be buried in my mother's grave
I'm a wing in the water between the dull waves
There's one that get shattered & ones that get saved

The Gallows where hungry & tawdry & slow
And fists full of candy for the children below
The bones of a horse, knee-deep in snow
There's one that are liars & ones that don't know

We go too slow (too slow) - ignore...
We go too slow (too slow) - hurray !
We go too slow (too slow) - ignore...

It was
No joke
When your engine broke
And the monsters came – a’brawling...

Those bankers
Always win,
And this trouble
That you're in
Is not your own
We're each and all this fallen...

Feathers
In your spokes
Motherfuck these
Weathered yokes,
I wish we could
But worries always calling...

Thieves
In our clothes
Trophies for their trifle
They don't know
Their glory's only
Vapors...

And pennies
For our pride
Goddamn these
Tired eyes
I'm so in love
With all
Our still born labors...

No homeland for the gentle-hearted
Lack and tears for the young departed
For all the good they never started

We're building train wrecks in the setting sun
We're building train wrecks in the setting sun
We're building train wrecks in the setting sun (in the setting sun)
