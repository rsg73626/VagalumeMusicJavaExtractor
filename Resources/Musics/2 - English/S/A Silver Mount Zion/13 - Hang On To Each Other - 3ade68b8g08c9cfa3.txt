HANG ON TO EACH OTHER

We all got born so afraid
We still search for words to describe that pain
And cling to each other
Like pigeons in the rain
And nuzzle over feathered breasts
With beaks all worn and cracked and stained

Hang on to each other
And hang on to each other...

So this one's for the lost ones
And the dead ones and the ones who fell away
All our busted brothers
Tumbled lovers spitting at the rain
We all got born so afraid
And still search for words to describe that pain

And hang on to each other
Hang on to each other
Hang on to any fucking thing you love...

Birds toss precious flowers
From the murky skies above...

Hang on to each other...
