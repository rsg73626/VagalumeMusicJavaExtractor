TAKE THESE HANDS AND THROW THEM IN THE RIVER

we got desperate waiting for our chance to come
i got drunk you got high
you would not let your eyes

we got desperate waiting for our chance to come
i got drunk you got high
you would not raise your eyes

cop cars on every corner
we're all alone
cop cars on every corner
we're crawling home

cop cars on every corner
we're all alone
cop cars on every corner
we're crawling home

take these hands and throw them in the river
take these hands and throw them in the river
take these hands and throw them in the river
take these hands and
bury them in your hands
bury them in your hands
bury them in your hands
bury them in your hands
