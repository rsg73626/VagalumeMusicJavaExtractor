TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S GUNS

Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son
You're a genteel rent boy choking on your tongue
And your bankers vain plazas never nutured no one
Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son

And your concrete expanses lay fallow in the sun
And your cities all collapsing while your corrupt mayors shrug
Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son

And your grownups all gone bankrupt and their children all on drugs
And your doe-eyed policeman demanding more guns
Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son
And your distained farmers waiting on the flood

Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son
Overfed and easy led and twisting in the wind
Your senators in diapers, all stinking of gin

Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son
Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son
Kanada, oh, Kanada, I ain't ever been your son...

Kanada, oh, Kanada, I have always been your son

Shop and save
Beneath the western Sun
Bought and paid for with
Teddy Roosevelt's guns

Teddy Roosevelt's guns
Teddy Roosevelt's guns
Teddy Roosevelt's guns...
