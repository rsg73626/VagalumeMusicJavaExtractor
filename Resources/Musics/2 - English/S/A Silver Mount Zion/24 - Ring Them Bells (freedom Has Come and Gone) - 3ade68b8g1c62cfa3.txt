RING THEM BELLS (FREEDOM HAS COME AND GONE)

Ring them bells
Ring them sorrowful bells
Now freedom has come and gone

We've been waiting so long
Never ever so long
Now freedom has come and gone

Shake that tail
Like any other worried soul
Now freedom has come and gone

Steam train's coming
Thirteen stories high
If that steam train don't come
I swear I will lay down and die

This city makes canyons
All littered with snow
And beneath their crummy towers
Our tiny bodies blow and blow

So drown them bells
Drown them miserable bells
Freedom has come and gone
Freedom has come and gone
Freedom has come and gone
Freedom has come and gone

We was all of us just tumbling birds hanging in the sky
And hauled our bones, long troubling roads, and didn't none of us know why
And as we staggered towards a frightening dawn
I swear all I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever believed in was all of us together all along

We was all of us just shot birds tumbling through the sky
We built cheap homes along company roads and didn't none of us ask why
And as we staggered towards a frightening dawn
I swear all I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever believed in was all of us together all along

Imagine the view
From a helicopter gun shift
And a man comes into view
And you hit that switch
And you cut that man in two

Imagine the view
When they bounce that shit off of satellites
And they hit that switch
And when they hit that switch
All the heaven shits on you

Imagine the view
From a helicopter gun shift
And a man comes into view
And you hit that switch
And you cut that man in two

Imagine the view
When they bounce that shit off of satellites
And they hit that switch
And when they hit that switch
All the heaven falls on you

Imagine the view
