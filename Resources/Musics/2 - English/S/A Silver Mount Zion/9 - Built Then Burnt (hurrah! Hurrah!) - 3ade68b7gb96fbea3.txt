BUILT THEN BURNT (HURRAH! HURRAH!)

Dear brothers and sisters 
dear enemies and friends 

Why are we all so alone here 
All we need is a little more hope, a little more joy 
All we need is a little more light, a little less weight, a little more freedom. 
If we were an army, and if we believed that we were an army 
And we believed that everyone was scared like little lost children in their grown up clothes and poses 
So we ended up alone here floating through long wasted days, or great tribulations. 
While everything felt wrong 
Good words, strong words, words that could've moved mountains 
Words that no one ever said 
We were all waiting to hear those words and no one ever said them 
And the tactics never hatched 
And the plans were never mapped 
And we all learned not to believe 
And strange lonesome monsters loafed through the hills wondering why 
And it is best to never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever wonder why 
So tangle - oh tangle us up in bright red ribbons! 
Let's have a parade 
It's been so long since we had a parade, so let's have a parade! 
Let's invite all our friends 
And all our friends' friends! 
Let's promenade down the boulevards with terrific pride and light in our eyes 
Twelve feet tall and staggering 
Sick with joy with the angels there and light in our eyes 
Brothers and sisters, hope still waits in the wings like a bitter spinster 
Impatient, lonely and shivering, waiting to build her glorious fires 
It's because of our plans man; our beautiful ridiculous plans 
Let's launch them like careening jetplanes 
Let's crash all our planes in the river 
Let's build strange and radiant machines at this jericho waiting to fall
