BABYLON WAS BUILT ON FIRE/STARSNOSTARS

Babylon was built on fire
And the bones of useless machines
It hurt to breath
And you fell away from me

Packs of helicopters divide
Across a crowded sky
What angels did you ride
As I staggered at your side

Babylon was built on fire
And the bones of useless machines
It hurt to breath
And you fell away from me

Citizens in their homes
Missiles in their holes
And citizens in their homes
And missiles in their holes...

This highway needs rain
Across both of its lanes
Until all that remains
Is this heart and its flames
And the rumble of trains
'Neath of a handful of stars

The brightest night I ever saw
Across an empty parking lot
No stars...
