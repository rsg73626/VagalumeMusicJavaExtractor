I BUILT MYSELF A METAL BIRD

I Built! My! Self! A! Me!tal! Bird! I! Fed! My! Metal! Bird! The! Wings! Of! Other! Me!tal! Birds!

And oh, how my baby flew!
With heart so high and aim so true!
Up to the roof and into the sky,
dumb as fire and twice as wise.

Did you see that star go out? (I seen it burn)
Did you see that star go out? (I seen it burn)

That little star went out,
your little eyes went out.
That little star went out,
your little eyes went out.

Our burnt little dreams are hid
up where the stars get lit.
Our burnt little dreams are hid
up where the stars get lit.

Now-time's the right time,
let's lay those demons down.
Our side's the right side,
let's lay those demons down.

We're virtueless in the white smoke.
Virtueless in the white smoke.
Virtueless in the white smoke.
Virtueless in the white smoke.

White smoke!
White smoke!
White!
