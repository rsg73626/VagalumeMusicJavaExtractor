SHAKE YOUR ASS GIRL

Dark hair dark eyes dream about me tonight
your olive skin stays on my mind
touching your back never felt so good
i felt the sweat between your thighs
you never told how you felt about me
between the sheets i heard you
i pray the sun stays out of our way
i dont want our nights to end

its all part of the game

goddamn girl you make me sweat.... its all part of the game baby

i wonder when i will have your full attention

dark hair dark eyes does he know you touched me
i never knew your kiss would taste this good

i know it makes him so jealous you stand up front during my show

goddamn girl you make me sweat....its all part of the game baby

i know this song makes you wet
i know this song makes you sweat
