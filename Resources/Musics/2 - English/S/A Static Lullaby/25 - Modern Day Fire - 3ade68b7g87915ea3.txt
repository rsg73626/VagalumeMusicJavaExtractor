MODERN DAY FIRE

Hold on tight, this is bound to lose your grip 
Take your ride, we took the stone off the pedal 
No time to be facetious 
We meant every word we said 

Last night awoke a bitter sweat 
A bitter taste in my mouth 
That has labeled me a weakness 
Tonight we'll entertain our guests... 
With a glass of water 
Yeah, to chase out our movement 

And you better get better 
(you better get better) 
Tomorrow we reinstate the dead 
(and we are, reinstate the dead) 
You better get better 
Today we're lining up instead 

Hold on tight, this is bound to lose your grip 
Take your ride, we took the stone of the pedal 

With time invites a lighter head 
That is followed by your body 
That is stapled to the mattress 
Don't tempt me 
Relay this broken pill that's just been siting in my pocket... 
I haven't lost my interest 

And you better get better 
(you better get better) 
Tomorrow we reinstate the dead 
(and we are, reinstate the dead) 
You better get better 
Today we're lining up instead 

(We can't be saved!) 

Light out, goodnight, sleep well, exhale! 
This pill, my mouth, time to, inhale! 
And in time the modern man will kill of the weekend 

And you better get better 
(you better get better) 
Tomorrow we reinstate the dead 
(and we are, reinstate the dead) 
You better get better 
Today we're lining up instead 

(and we are, reinstate the dead) 
And now I'm feeling much better 
(I'm feeling much better) 
You know, I'm feeling much better 
(reinstate the dead) 
I'm really feeling much better 
(reinstate the dead) 
Today we're lining up instead...
