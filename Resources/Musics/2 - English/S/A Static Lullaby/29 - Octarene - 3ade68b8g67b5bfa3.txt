OCTARENE

Can't wait to make this right
Fall in love and lose yourself tonight
I take the bus and I watch the streets go by
I take the bus and I watch the streets go by

As pages turn the plot begins to thicken
I'm bond to your seems
But I've fallen apart so many words
But I'm losing the place to my heart

There's got to be a better way 
To get what you want
Baby if I held you to the light
What would I find out?

Your sweetness is locked deep inside my bed
(Another)
And I believe that there's more of me to go around
Do you like how that sits in your stomach baby?
Will you sit and watch yourself turning around

There's got to be a better way 
To get what you want
Baby if I held you to the light
What would I find out?

Please wait just a second
Is that enough to make you stay?
Probobly not but here it comes
I believe my hand makes a better lover
But you're just the best I ever had

Let's find a new addiction I can no longer be your
fix
How does it feel to know that the magic's gone
There nothing you can do
These words 

Let's find a new addiction I can no longer be your
fix
Let's find a new addiction

There's got to be a better way 
To get what you want
Baby if I held you to the light
What would I find out?

Baby you can only lose this 
One day I won't come back
Baby if I held you to the light
What would I find out?
