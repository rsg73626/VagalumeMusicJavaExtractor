EAGER CANNIBALS

A savage thought becomes him
By the light shining through her dress
The flesh under his finger nails
The lips upon her chest
And with the night pressing on
She weakens behind his eyes
She urns for him inside her
Collapsing by the bedside

You want more
You got more
Cant be too safe girl
Its alright
Just undress
Her lips and
His caress

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Off of the blood of someone else

Two bodies lie shackled
By the clenching of their fists
One body lie injected 
Behind the others head
With the sun pressing on
She weakens behind his eyes
She urns for him inside her
Collapsing by the bedside

You’re up boy
don’t slow down
With constant temptations
Who said love
Its alright
Will become by the end of the night

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Of off the blood of someone else
Were sharpening the spectrum
Of these feelings
(We get along, along so well)
A puss eating believing we would
Ever share with someone else

I feel you breathing
Behind my neck

Can I still feel you breathing
Behind my neck

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Of off the blood of someone else
Were sharpening the spectrum
Of these feelings
(We get along, along so well)
A puss eating believing we would
Ever share with someone else

We went assaulted bodies
Fell asleep between her legs
Medicate before tomorrow
Is that love? Is that love?
