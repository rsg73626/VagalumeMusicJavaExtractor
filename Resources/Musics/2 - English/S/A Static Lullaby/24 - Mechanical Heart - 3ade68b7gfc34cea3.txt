MECHANICAL HEART

Retrace the steps that led
To a cellophane headdress
And they were found asphyxiated
In a pool of tears that follow

Retrace the steps that led
To a cellophane headdress
And they were found asphyxiated
In a pool of tears that follow

Breathe in
Breathe out
Rape this

And so then came discretion (suffering)
And all the secrets of the silent suffering (so they strayed)
And so they stray possession
Murdering the suffer in
The silencing behind our walls

In the script of blood
They state that this is the purpose
And they were found asphyxiated
By all the words that were painted

Keep your children locked up
There's the one they wanted
Will they betray since departed
If its the way we wanted

And so then came discretion (suffering)
And all the secrets of the silent suffering (so they strayed)
And so they stray possession
Murdering the suffer in
The silencing behind our walls

What did we say
Bring us to earth
Please rape our adolescence
Please rape our adolescence
What did you say
Bring me to earth
Please rape my adolescence
Please rape my adolescence

And so then came discretion (suffering)
And all the secrets of the silent suffering (so they strayed)
And so they stray possession
Murdering the suffer in
The silencing behind our walls

So child close your eyes
And rest your head
It bleeds with slumber
So child close your eyes
And rest your head
It bleeds with slumber
So child close your eyes
And rest your head
It bleeds with slumber
So child close your eyes
And rest your head
It bleeds with slumber

So child close your eyes
