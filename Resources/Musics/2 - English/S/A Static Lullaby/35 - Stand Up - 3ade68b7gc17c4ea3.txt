STAND UP

This town of sober answers
Feel free to watch your city
Become more than a sitcom appendix
As we walk, the streets are bleeding
From the telium that they're bringing
The stars will pave your journey
To another x-rated love story

The hills have become your idles
The hills have become your idles

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better
We'll do anything
(this town has killed us both)

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better
We'll do anything
(this town has killed us both)
Stand up cause this town is failing us

This town is shifting power
Covered under useless ratings
Let's decide how to feed your children
Let's appall to the sound they're scripting
Seeing smile of the pain you're buying
Will it hurt when we live in paradise?
We'll wash it off on sunset

Seeing smile of the pain you're buying
Seeing smile of the pain you'll buy

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better
We'll do anything
(this town has killed us both)

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better
We'll do anything
(this town has killed us both)
Stand up cause this town is failing us

This might be your chance
And when you find them running with
Your gun in hand

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better
We'll do anything
(this town has killed us both)

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better
We'll do anything
(this town has killed us both)
Stand up
