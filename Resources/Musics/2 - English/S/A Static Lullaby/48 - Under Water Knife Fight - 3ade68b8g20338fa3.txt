UNDER WATER KNIFE FIGHT

I smell the shit and piss
I swear i found my equal
A gutter philosopher
He's not clean, He's from the streets
But his words are holy to me

He narrates his life as a silhouette
He's legendary, A martyr for despair and tragedy
Yet post-traumatic he shares with me
Sleep and surrender
The bandage of past resides in my dreams
My blood is oil, fossilized, poisoned and perfect black

Release me to the night
In the darkness I'm behind the light
Transparent flight
As you see (I'm fading)
That I've begun to fade
A shadow I remain

Were mortal in humanity
Immortal after being

Does the burden of life proceed?
(After I'm dead) Or do we lie peaceful as we enter sleep?
He's falling over screaming at me

Choke you pretender
Your spitting out phrases of fallacy
Love is lie, paralyzed, by your reflection of staring back

Release me to the night
In the darkness I'm behind the light
Transparent flight
As you see (I'm fading)
That I've begun to fade
A shadow I remain

Young man learn to trust your drink
It only costs a fraction of the price
You pay to get her under sheets
Young man its better to have never loved
Then find the one whom
Will cast you into the shadows
Learning how to live your life as a silhouette

Were mortal in humanity
Immortal after being

Oh, It's just the price you pay
Oh, Just take the hint from me
Oh, if this goes another year
Oh, just say fuck the world you lost your girl

Release me to the night
In the darkness I'm behind the light
Transparent flight
As you see (I'm fading)
That I've begun to fade
A shadow I remain
