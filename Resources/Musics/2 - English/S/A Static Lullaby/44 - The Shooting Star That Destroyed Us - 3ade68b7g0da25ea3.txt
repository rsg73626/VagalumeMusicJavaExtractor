THE SHOOTING STAR THAT DESTROYED US

A star up in the sky
A poem to the death
Let this mistake
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
So drain out my lungs
Before the fluid brings a choke
I can’t inhale the sparkle of your voice

A star up in the sky
A poem to the death
Let this mistake
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
So drain out my lungs
Before the fluid brings a choke
I can’t inhale the sparkle of your voice

Let me walk on high wire of rusty nails
While barefoot shedding the flesh of our existance

I don’t want anybody to fall

A star up in the sky
A poem to the death
Let this mistake
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
So drain out my lungs
Before the fluid brings a choke
I can’t inhale the sparkle of your voice

Now’s it time
Now’s it time

The more I try
The more I lose
But today
Will you remember me ? 

But today
Will you remember me ? 
But today
Your eyes

Your eyes
They shine
Your eyes

Your eyes
They shine
Your eyes

Your eyes
They shine
Your eyes

Your eyes
They shine
Your eyes

Your eyes

Your eyes
They shine
Your eyes

Walking home
Street lights go out

Walking home
Street lights go out

A star up in the sky
A poem to the death
Let this mistake
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
So drain out my lungs
Before the fluid brings a choke
I can’t inhale the sparkle of your voice
