EVERYBODY'S GOT A LIL' FONZ N' EM

You know that time in your life
That single moment that defines exactly who you are
Well that only stings for a second
Go!

I ain't no Frank Sinatra
I ain't no Sammy D
But I'm a rodent, baby
And I got a love song to sing
I'm cool like Miles Davis
Hot just like Jerry Lee
When it comes to rocking, baby
No one's better then me
A music man can't keep his girl
This boy travels around the world
Her picture framed in his sleep
He'll be home in 3 weeks

Hey, I feel like I'm crashing
Bright lights flashing
What time does my flight leave?
Sounds to me like engines failing
I'm done praying
I'm ready

She ain't no Elvis Presley
But I think that she moves just like the king
I guess she's feeling lonely
So she walked out on me
She ain't no Paul McCartney
But she's the insect in me
Crawling through my body, baby
Her poison travels through me
A music man can't play anymore
Can't place his calls from the road
Without her voice he can't eat
He'll be dead in 3 weeks

Hey, I feel like I'm crashing
Bright lights flashing
What time does my flight leave?
Sounds to me like engines failing
I'm done praying
I'm ready

I slayed the dove
Betrayed by love
Can't find the vein
To escape the fame
I slayed the dove
Betrayed by love
Who killed Cobain?
His girl or pain?

I got a year till I'm turning twenty-seven
I got a manic whore and a healthy habit
I've been fucked by labels that had to have a record
Am I destined for this or will I buckle under pressure?
A music man can't save the world
But you get his heart and his soul
Transmitted through the song that he sings
I hope you bought this one from me

Hey, I feel like I'm crashing
Bright lights flashing
What time does my flight leave?
Sounds to me like engines failing
I'm done praying
I'm ready

I ain't Mick Jagger
I ain't no Bobby D
But I'm a poet, baby
And I got a rhyming scheme
Feel pain like Johnny Cash
And I cry like Frankie V
When it comes to loving you
I need therapy

I'll see you at the funeral
I'll see you at the funeral
I'll see you at the funeral

I'll see you at the funeral
