LET GO

Drink up, baby down 
Mmm, are you in or are you out 
Leave your things behind 
'cause it's all going off without you 
Excuse me, too busy you're writing your tragedy 
These mishaps 
You bubble wrap 
When you've no idea what you're like 

So let go, jump in 
Oh well, whatcha waiting for 
It's alright 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown 
So let go, just get in 
Oh, it's so amazing here 
It's alright 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown 

It gains the more it gives 
And then it rises with the fall 
So hand me that remote 
Can't you see that all that stuff's a sideshow 

Such boundless pleasure 
We've no time for later now 
You can't await your own arrival 
You've 20 seconds to comply 

So let go, jump in 
Oh well, whatcha waiting for 
It's alright 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown 
So let go, just get in 
Oh, it's so amazing here 
It's alright 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown 

So let go, jump in 
Oh well, whatcha waiting for 
It's alright 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown 
So let go, just get in 
Oh, it's so amazing here 
It's alright 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown 
'cause there's beauty in the breakdown
