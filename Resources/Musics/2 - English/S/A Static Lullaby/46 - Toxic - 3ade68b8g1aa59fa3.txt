TOXIC

Baby, can't you see?
I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling

There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it

Too high
Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're
toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're
toxic?

It's gettin' late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my Devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high
Can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're
toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're
toxic?

With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're
toxic?

With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're
toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're
toxic?
