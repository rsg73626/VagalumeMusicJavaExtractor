EASIER SAID THAN DONE

Why don't you try harder?
Next Time, we're better safe than sorry
When I'm gone
And I'm never coming back again
So now you think I'm crazy
And I know I love you and...
Who cares?

She's gone
Away
And left you sad and lonely
The world you knew before is gone
And you wish that she would
Call
To say
You know i'm sad and lonely
And everything before
Is everything I have

So why don't you say sorry?
Next Time
We're better safe than sorry
When i'm gone
And i'm never coming back again
So now you think i'm crazy
And now you know i love you and...

She's gone
Away
And left you sad and lonely
The world you knew before is gone
And you wish that she would
Call
To say
You know i'm sad and lonely
And everything before
Is everything I have

But you knew it
Without got your answer
But when you're gone
Without your answer
But when you're gone
Without got your answer
But when you're gone
Without got your answer

If you got your answer
But when you're gone
You pick out your answer
But when you're gone
Without your answer
But when you're gone
Without your answer...
