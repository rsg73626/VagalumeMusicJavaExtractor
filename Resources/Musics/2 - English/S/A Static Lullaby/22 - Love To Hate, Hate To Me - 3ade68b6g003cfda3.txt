LOVE TO HATE, HATE TO ME

Read the tale of my desire 
Never walked away 
A book of hate 
Never exhale 
1000 volts 
I never walked away 
For every smile you gave me 
Never exhale 

As your eyes close 
I'll bring before the sight of true unhappiness 
Whisper I care 
Then gracious enough to let you go 
Remember me for the times I ruined you 
Not I made you smile 
Take this blade to my wrist 
Help me end what makes you ugly 
Swimming in the pools of my mind 
You come to me at night 
Leave me black and save yourself 

Never walked away 
A book of hate 
Never exhale 
1000 volts 
I never walked away 
For every smile you gave me 
Never exhale 

The story prolongs 
With each word my stomach starts to turn 
I have swallowed nails 
So I can never say your name 
Now words are heard through my eyes 

Take this blade to my wrist 
Help me end what makes you ugly 
Swimming in the pools of my mind 
You come to me at night 
Leave me black and save yourself 

Can you see the fire that burns from my heart 
This song is for you 
So perfect 
I have made an attempt to have you 

Light up this cigarette 
Tonight I will sleep with the gun in my mouth
Good night my love
