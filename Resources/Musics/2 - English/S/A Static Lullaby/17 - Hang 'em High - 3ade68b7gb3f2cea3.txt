HANG 'EM HIGH

I have just been in a car crash
I have just been in a car crash
Making it out alive

He finds himself
He's lost it
The breath between life and drowning

Cauterize
These open wounds
The bloods rushes out
These too much around
Paralyzed
The world to move
Taking to much stakes
It will take years
It will take years

And it's more than just a lust
But it's over
We're not singing for the world
And it's over
(I can't wait)
Can't wait
(To get out of the way)
And we're giving up our lifes
For this revolution

For this revolution
This revolution

Realized
The broken glass
The concrete paint the lines
Too many times the steel have won
We're pulling out to make it on our own
Running through the crowded hallways
Can we make it out alive?

And it's more than just a lust
But it's over
We're not singing for the world
And it's over
(I can't wait)
Can't wait
(To get out of the way)
And we're giving up our lifes
For this revolution

These open wounds
Still run
This broken glass
Have cut me open
Stalling to make it out
Stalling to make it out
Stalling to make it out
This time
this is life in a car crash

And it's more than just a lust
But it's over
We're not singing for the world
And it's over
(I can't wait)
Can't wait
(To get out of the way)
Can't wait
(Can't wait)
And we're giving up the world
For this revolution

And it's more than just a lust
But it's over
We're not singing for the world
And it's over
(I can't wait)
Can't wait
(To get out of the way)
And we're giving up our lifes
For this revolution
