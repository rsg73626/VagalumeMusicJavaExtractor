THE PRESTIGE

No ounce of god
As the alter bleeds
No form of priest at this gathering
No ounce of god as the alter bleeds

So nice to meet detective Ace McCree
I appreciate your tactful timing
Can't say the same for your little girl
But here's something you might not know

She's pink inside just like my other toys
And the blue has been ripped from her ocean eyes
But Jamie, she no longer breathes

This is the famine, the flood
The locust that eclipse the sun
And as the sulfur and smoke surrounds me
Three plagues from heaven unleashed
And as the trumpet sings
The ocean bleeds
The army of god sets upon me
I wear the mark of the beast

Jamie speak
And Jamie oh god please
Just take me, please just take me

She's draped in red upon the cutting board
As I look through the butcher's eyes
Please Jamie, tell me his life or mine

One bullet for love
One bullet for god
One bullet for the monster in all of us

One bullet for love
One bullet for god
One bullet for the monster in all of us


This is the fire the blood
The hail that blocks out the sun
And as the sulfur and smoke surrounds me
Three plagues from heaven unleashed
As the trumpets sing
These angels are freed
The army of god sets upon me
I wear the mark of the beast

Now you see why you've come
It was your hand that killed her mom
You were driven insane because your daughter had her mother's eyes
I am you and you are I

Burn me alive
I've taken my daughters life

Buried alive
I've taken her mothers life

Burn me alive
Buried alive

This killing spree is no longer ecstasy
The burden of living is now what haunts me
I have exorcised my inner ghost
Another wounded lover lost control
Beyond the grave
She waits for me
