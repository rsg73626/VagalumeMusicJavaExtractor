LOOKING FOR PLAYERS

I look for people who wants to play,
musics in this style,
compared to a static lullaby,
i focus on a drummer,
and a guy that screams like joe,
the band is almost complete,
we wanna play our songs,
but we make some covers,
all around this style.

if you want to joins us,
send me a reply,
we're glad, and if you saw ths and know someone who likes to play this kind of music please tell him to make contact.
