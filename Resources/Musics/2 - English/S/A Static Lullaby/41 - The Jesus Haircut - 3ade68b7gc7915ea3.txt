THE JESUS HAIRCUT

It's time we took this holiday 
We thank you and send our regards 
The beach is great, this time of year 
4th of June we see 
The first sight of snow we'll sing 
and this was beautiful (and this is beautiful) 
and this was beautiful (and this is beautiful) 

and you must feel (that this is a better way of dying) 
We trusted you (we trusted you, we trusted YOU!) 

Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 
Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 
Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 
Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 

And maybe we'll say you lost your tongue 
Behind your fatal lies 
We know your starving for 
The chance to make this right 
A silent song that's left of your 
Important stories 
They honest have let you go 
For breach of your contract 

And you must feel (that this is a better way of dying) 
We trusted you (we trusted you, we trusted YOU!) 

Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 
Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 
Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 
Praise! Fuck! Destroy! 

We trusted you 
I trusted you.... 

We've all played the part 
We've all played the part 
played the part 
played the part 
played the part....
