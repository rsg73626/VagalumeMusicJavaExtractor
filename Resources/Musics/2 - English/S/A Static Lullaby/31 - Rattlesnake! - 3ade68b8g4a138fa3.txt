RATTLESNAKE!

God damn, holy diver
You made it right back to my bed
Manifested lips that whisper kiss
That whisper kiss

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Pull the shades, pull the shades (I'm gutted)
Guilty, plagued, guilty, plagued (And lonely)

I admit you won't see me again
My end is desperately engaged
Dark, departed, hollow
You see I'm just a shadow
This ravenous beast is chasing shame
A shadow he remains

How will my voice carry tonight?
How do I look under these lights?
Shove my head into the grand ivory keys
Maybe -this will teach me how to sing

Fuck hope, I'm a terror
Heavyweight human disaster
I think I found love (But what's love?)
Why can't we be loved?

Burn, burn, burn it down
Icarus just hit the ground
To the youth that thought they could fly
I bottled up just drank up and died

OH

How will my voice carry tonight?
How do I look under these lights?
Shove my head into the grand ivory keys
Maybe -this will teach me how to sing

Palest white
I'm blues and reds
This patriot is long past dead

Palest white
I'm blues and reds
This patriot is long past... dead

Forever ending remain
But still gone
Oh God, I fear the steel
Oh, I fear the steel

Forever ending remain
But still gone
Oh God, I fear the steel
Oh, I fear the steel

Burn! Burn! Burn!

How will my voice carry tonight?
How do I look under these lights?
Shove my face into the grand ivory keys
Maybe -this will teach me how to sing

My end is desperately engaged
