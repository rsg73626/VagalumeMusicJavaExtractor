NIGHTMARES WIN 6-0

This nightmare ends. 
as the cocoon fills with oil.
fossils bocome waste upon cemented wings. 
on the rocks father spills memories of mothers eyes. 
a kiss turns to brandy. 
a dagger learns to cut hair. 
lipstick stains her addiction...
watch the cresent moon turn clouds into frowns. 
watch to sea swallow and forget...
given up ambiton for and legs...
venom engulfs the most precious fairy tales. 
goldilocks fogets the bite for prince charming...
each window breaths smoke, pacement paces while ciggarettes burn.
