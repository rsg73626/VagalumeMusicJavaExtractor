BEAR TRAP

Engraved with the notion that love lies under the sheets
And that stanima is built by twice the number of drinks
Still so I'm led to believe it's no lack of morality
I lead young females with daddy complexes back to sleep

We're meant to breed
And so we breed
Just filling the void inside me
My seed won't see the earth
Ending reproduction

Silence the crowd's commotion and find what's ticking
Addict, depressive, so good looking the bomb inside me
My parents passed this on to me it's the same old story
But I refuse to let this be the last song that I sing

I've invested love back into the unloved
So where's my retribution, baby?
I've invested love back into the unloved
And found out that
(She'll never fill the void)
(She's always wanting more)

Just round them up, this is the calling of the gun
Just round them up, this is the youth extermination
Just round them up, this is the calling of the gun
Just round them up, this is the youth extermination

Oh my God, is she looking at me?
The perfect match for my insecurity

We're meant to breed
And so we breed
Just filling the void inside of me
My seed won't see the earth
Ending reproduction
The child exiled in me
(Ending reproduction)

I've invested love back into the unloved
So where's my retribution, baby?
I've invested love back into the unloved
And found out that
(She'll never fill the void)
(She's always wanting more)

So mommy fucked the mailman, and daddy left you both
So mommy fucked the mailman, and daddy left you both

So it seems I've fallen for another bruised Georgia peach
I'm convinced I'm only attracted to her through my own inadequacy
Fearlessly I lead young females with daddy complexes back to sleep
Is this breeding or filling the void inside me?

I've invested love back into the unloved
So where's my retribution, baby?
I've invested love back into the unloved
I've invested love back into the unloved
I've invested love back into the unloved
And found out that
(She'll never fill the void)
(She's always wanting more)
