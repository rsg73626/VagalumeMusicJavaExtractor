A SIP OF WINE CHASED WITH CYANIDE

Glorify her smile 
Condemn his frown 

Choke on the phrases left unsaid 
Silver bullets that pierce my ears 
Shadows of demons melt my persona 
Taken from the memory of the darkess lock 

Can I walk amongst the slave chained to the hopeless
and lenched from your smile 
Can I float upon your tears swealtering the hate for our non-existance 

Send the dove 
Bring her a star 
Throw me a raven 
Spoon out my heart 

With the last ounce of dignity 
I will pray 
Scream out 
My mistakes to the heavens 

Send the dove 
Bring her a star 
Throw me a raven 
Spoon out my.. 
Spoon out my heart
