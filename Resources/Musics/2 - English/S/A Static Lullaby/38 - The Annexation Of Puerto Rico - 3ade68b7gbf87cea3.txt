THE ANNEXATION OF PUERTO RICO

Sounding off in revelations
The end is far past near
Falling fast through a concrete passage
Down, down, down
These questions will
My question will I find her
That kiss so sweet, sweet, sweet
That body lies so gently down
As heaven weeps without her
Do what this beggar pleads and bury me, bury me
Do what this beggar pleads
Do what this beggar pleads and bury me, bury me
She's the one and I'll search forever
Latch onto the souls of these cliffs
Ask the damned to lend a hand
That body lies so gently down
Now heaven weeps without her
Salvation returns as I'm coming undone
Unlock your heart love
And please remind yourself
That breathings not the same
Since I take in air for you
And I'm pulling fucking through
