CASH COWBELL

the cash cow is feeding us
someone we don't know is buying us
and we are temporary

do you, want to feel
like the knife is in you?
(like the knife is in you)

can't complain, can't complain, can't complain
we have nothing left to lose
before we sleep together
(before we sleep together)

they've been pulling our strings
and i guess we're set for motion
with productivity

do you, want to feel
like the knife is in you?
(like the knife is in you)
do you, want to feel
a Swiss army proposition?
(a Swiss army proposition)

can't complain, can't complain, can't complain
i'm debonair, i'm debonair, so debonair
can't complain, can't complain, can't complain
i'm debonair, i'm debonair, so debonair

we are temporary
(we're temporary)
temporary

do you, want to feel
(do you want to)
like the knife is in you?
(like the knife is in you)
do you, want to feel
