STARE AT THE AIR

Itâ€™s in the air
For all our guests to stare
Their speech left pacified
With a cowards glare
Is she haunted by a glow
That beauty soft as now
A frantic pounding grabs his heart
The beats mimicked by his thought
To plot against this may be a deadly deed
With a shriek of horror
Fleeing bringing them to their weary knees
A poet crumbles by the alter
A shock from on to bare
The fainting of a man
By the lips under the veil
The reckless become the tragic
Reside night bring light to day
In the wake
Something may never beat the shame in pain
