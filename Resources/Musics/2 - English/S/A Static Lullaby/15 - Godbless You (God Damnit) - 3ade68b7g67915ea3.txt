GODBLESS YOU (GOD DAMNIT)

is this the end of all discretion 
has turning in left us tuning out 
and so this special song 
goes to my first all 
the ocean avenue, yeah 

and this winter will set aside our feelings 
cool it down, we'll set the standards 
for the emotionless we'll raise the stakes 
cool it down, we're cooling down 

is this the end of our obsession 
saying you love them just a little to much 
and so i guess thats how we got in this game 
i can play this game, yeah 

and this winter will set aside our feelings 
cool it down, we'll set the standards 
for the emotionless we'll raise the stakes 
cool it down, we're cooling down 

mutilation (mutilation) 
mutilation (mutilation) 
mutilation (mutilation) 
mutilation (mutilation) 

and this winter will set aside our feelings 
cool it down, we'll set the standards 
for the emotionless we'll raise the stakes 
cool it down, we're cooling down 

to help the storm in us 
we have no spine or scent 
we treat to the openless 
were all spent 
so deep in setting up 
with our hands held so high 
the snow begins to bleed 
and whos to blame?
