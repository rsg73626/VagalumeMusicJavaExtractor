ALLER AU DIABLE

So now I...

I fell in love with a fucking tragedy
And if it's passion that you want
Baby, I'll ignite the flame

So if it's sorry that you want
Take a second to see
No one can be as sorry as me

This awakening in me
That leaves the scalpel starving for flesh
So slice me up, crack open my ribs
To find nothing beating
Oh baby, I'm flat lining

Oasis, you said you loved me
Instead you left me frozen and cold
Just keep the rope tight
Keep me wrapped up tonight

And it's a struggle
And I've been choking
On the right words to say to you
My heart, my soul, my fear, my faith
All have encompassed you

So find a way to put me
Please, find a way to put me down
When the surgeon gets the shakes
I'm filled to the brim with empty
Can't you see you're the best of what's inside me?
I've murdered myself in your name

Flat lining, still drowning, she's burning, I'm fucking freezing

Drown the whore
No not yet we still gotta get it right
Fire and Flame
Well it's about right, burn that bitch tonight

And so we are a grim psychosis
My slumber serves me another lethal dose

Please, find a way to put me
Please, find a way to put me down
When the surgeon gets the shakes
I'm filled to the brim with empty
Can't you see you're the best of what's inside me?
I've murdered myself in your name

One love in two lives
Love dies in her life
Leaves me with a still framed love life

She left me trembling in this white robe
Locked up and shackled in this dark room
You left me trembling in this white robe

So find a way to put me
Please, find a way to put me down
When the surgeon gets the shakes
I'm filled to the brim with empty
Can't you see you're the best of what's inside me?
I've murdered myself in your name

Can't you see?
Can't you see you're the best of what's inside me?
I've murdered myself in your name

Flat lining, still drowning, she's burning, I'm fucking freezing

I'm filled to the brim and it's all right
I'm filled to the brim with empty
I'm filled to the brim and it's all right
I'm filled to the brim with empty
