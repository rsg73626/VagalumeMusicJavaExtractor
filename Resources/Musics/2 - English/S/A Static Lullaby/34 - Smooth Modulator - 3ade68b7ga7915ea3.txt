SMOOTH MODULATOR

(One day we'll crush this van 
wind up in your attic 
And with what we learned last night 
We can never take ourselves away) 

No self control 
We are blown to the winds and we'll float 
From state to wretched state 
Crematories for past relationships 
(We separate ourselves) 

Can we push this any further (stand back) 
And watch your family fall apart (much more) 
Much more than playing off of words but 
Losing a piece of myself 

(With what we learned last night 
I can never take myself away) 

I'm sure we're all the same 
And we've found a way to 
Associate ourselves for love of money 
and we're glorified 
(We separate ourselves) 

Can we push this any further (stand back) 
And watch your family fall apart (much more) 
Much more than playing off of words but 
Losing a piece of myself 
A piece of myself 

Our lovers drink alone tonight (our lovers drink alone tonight) [x3] 
Tonight, tonight, tonight! 

Can we push this any further (dead end) 
And watch your family fall apart (much more) 
Much more than playing off of words but 
Losing a piece of myself 

Our lovers drink alone tonight (our lovers drink alone tonight) [x4] 
[chorus repeated in the background]
