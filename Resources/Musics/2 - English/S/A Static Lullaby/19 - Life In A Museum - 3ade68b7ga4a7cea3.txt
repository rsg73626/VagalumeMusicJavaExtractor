LIFE IN A MUSEUM

The scene has retaken shape
It seems your stuck in the middle
The legs of your lover
Have spread for another
You're invaded and coming undone

Retrace, recount, reuse (undone)
Become, believe, be well
Impress, impose, embark (undone)
Conceal, connect, conquer

You give it all
And sometimes fade away
We give it all
We all just fade
It's not love
We're not love
[x2]

But I'm not perishing
(Cause vengeance holds my hand)
To be lost amongst the slaves
(While shackled)
Shackled and blistering
(Its now lust that holds my hand)
Tonight I'll find my way

So now you think this is safe
Oh boy you better be careful
And oh, I've never had the chance for
This kind of love
I'm infected, I'm coming undone

Retrace, recount, reuse (undone)
Become, believe, be well
Impress, impose, embark (undone)
Conceal, connect, conquer

But I'm not perishing
(Cause vengeance holds my hand)
To be lost amongst the slaves
(While shackled)
Shackled and blistering
(Its now lust that holds my hand)
Tonight I'll find my way

Find my way!

Retrace, recount, reuse
Become, believe, be well
Impress, impose, embark
Conceal, connect
Retrace, recount

But I'm not perishing
(Cause vengeance holds my hand)
To be lost amongst the slaves
(While shackled)
Shackled and blistering
(Its now lust that holds my hand)
Tonight I'll find my way
(Tonight I'll find my way, way)
