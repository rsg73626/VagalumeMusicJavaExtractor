CONTAGIOUS

So child, we have to see this through
The choking has you foaming at the mouth
Our bodies convulsing on the floor
Like a fish out of water
The price of wanting more

Epilepsy seems
seems safe enough for me
It’s alright girl, it’s alright

[Chorus:]
Contagious, contagious as this seems
And girl, you’re catching on to me
Shut down, shut down, break away
And this is slightly what it’s meant to be
The perfect line, the perfect time
When our bodies align

A pale smile struggles behind tears
While passion meets you striking at your face
Instantly we bottle our feelings
So tell me why are you crying
The price for wanting more

But then again it seems
You’re safe enough for me
It’s alright girl, it’s alright

[Chorus]

What defines this man
What defines this man finding space in lovers' hands.

Is this what it seems to be?
Who said this lasts forever?
[5x]

Who said this lasts forever
Who said this lasts forever

[Chorus]

Contagious, contagious
Contagious, contagious
Contagious (when our bodies align)
Contagious.
