NOVEMBER 24, 1995

1-2..
1-2-3..
1-2-3... Go!

It's fucking all the same
And "hello" was all I could muster to say
With a hate-filled lie screaming my name
I grab a photo and begin to play
We never find a way out
Put on some raspberry chapstick
I am the knife that loves to cut
And make lunch out of his guts
It resembles something I can feel
I was a man who fought no sin
And I pour a bowl of surreal
Come home before you find one

Lost, lost, lost, lost
In my opinion longer than it should
And if only I could

Last chance to change this
Lost but found, Lost and found
I don't believe people contribute to it
The lost life is underground
Say, say something else
Anyway I might as well

It's fucking all a game
And "hello" was all I could muster to play
With a hate-filled lie screaming so tame
I grab a photo and begin to say
We never find a way out
Put on some raspberry chapstick
I am the knife that loves to cut
And make lunch out of his guts
It resembles something I can feel
I was a man who fought no sin
And I pour a bowl of surreal
Come home before you find one

Lost, lost, lost, lost
In my opinion longer than it should
And if only I could

Last chance to change this
Lost but found, Lost and found
I don't believe people contribute to it
The lost life is underground
Say, say something else
Anyway I might as well

It's all the last thing I thought about
She sighs her way in listens to the shouts
It's all the last thing I thought about
She sighs her way in listens to the shouts
It's all the last thing I thought about
(Give me, give me almost something)
She sighs her way in listens to the shouts
(And that future rose in the mourning)
It's all the last thing I thought about
(Give me, give me almost something)
She sighs her way in listens to the shouts
(And that future rose in the mourning)
It's all the last thing I thought about
(Give me, give me almost something)
She sighs her way in listens to the shouts
(And that future rose in the mourning)

Lost, lost, lost, lost
In my opinion longer than it should
And if only I could

Yeah.. that's all
