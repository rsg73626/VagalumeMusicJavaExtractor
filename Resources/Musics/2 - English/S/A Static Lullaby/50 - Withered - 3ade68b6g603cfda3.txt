WITHERED

Where did summer go? 
Left me to wonder when the bottle will tap out. 
And the sun will arise. 
I woke up yesterday with a hole in my chest...

(Yet i feel no pain) numb to all feeling 
(Like in winters chill) to feel the warmth from this bottle is useless 
(When you wake up it's gone) when you wake up it all starts again. 

I learned to break yesterday. 
Destroy tomorrow. 
I've watched each leaf fall off my tree. 
I've watched the seasons change.

(yet i feel no pain) numb to all feeling 
(like in winters chill) to feel the warmth from this bottle is useless 
(when you wake up it's gone) when you wake up it all starts again. 

(Why?) it all starts again
(Why step aside when you fall back in place?) it all starts again
(Why? why? why?) 
(Oh misery is so beautiful...)

(Yet i feel no pain) numb to all feeling 
(Like in winters chill) to feel the warmth from this bottle is useless 
(When you wake up it√Ωs gone) when you wake up it all starts again.

I need this...
