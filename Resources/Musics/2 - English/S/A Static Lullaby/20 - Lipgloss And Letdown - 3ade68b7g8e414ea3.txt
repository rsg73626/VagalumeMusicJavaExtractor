LIPGLOSS AND LETDOWN

Blind to the answers, find yourself,
Walk for the moment; find the reason in yourself,
There's a reason for you and I(x3)

Take this time to find a meaning,
A reason to sit back and measure the worst six years of my life,
Waiting for your legs to close on my best friends,
Last night I saw your life flash before my eyes,

Why did I laugh so hard baby?
(You won't be back and I'm still laughing)
I never meant to hurt you (but I did)
I'm sorry that you cried so hard darling, (you won't be back)
I'll never hurt you again,

Take this time to find your tongue,
A sorry excuse to stop your lies,
The best 30 seconds of my life,

My angel, take your pills,
My angel, I sold your ring,
And now you're speechless
And I can't stop laughing,

Why did I laugh so hard baby?
(You won't be back and I'm still laughing)
I never meant to hurt you (but I did)
I'm sorry that you cried so hard darling, (you won't be back)
I'll never hurt you again

Why did I laugh so hard baby?
(You won't be back and I'm still laughing)
I never meant to hurt you (but I did)
I'm sorry that you cried so hard darling, (you won't be back)
I'll never hurt you again

I didn't want it this way,
I hope you're happy where you are
And I'm glad to say I put you there,
Who's the one that's laughing now,
I'm the one who's laughing now
(Now there's nothing left to say I hope you're feeling my embrace, and I can't sleep
You should have left me sleeping
You should have let me sleep....)
