GLOBES AND MAPS

Light breaks underneath
A heavy door
And I try to keep myself awake
Fall all around us on a hotel floor
And you think that you've made a mistake
And there's a pain in my stomach
From another sleepless binge
And I struggle to get myself up again
I wanna hang on to something
That won't break away for fall apart
Like the pieces of my heart

Globes and maps are all around me now
I wanna feel you breathe me in
Globes and maps I see surround you here
Why won't you believe me?
Globes and maps they chart your way back home
Do you wanna leave or something?

Dreams came around you
In a hazy rain
You open your mouth wide to feel them fall

And I write a letter from a one-way train
But I don't think you'll read it at all

Globes and maps are all around me now
I wanna feel you breathe me in
Globes and maps I see surround you here
Why won't you believe me?
Globes and maps they chart your way back home
Do you wanna leave or something?

I can't take this anymore
I know that I can't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
Cause I know someday I'll see you walk out that door
Globes and maps are all around me now
I wanna feel you breathe me in
Globes and maps I see surround you here
Why won't you believe me?
Globes and maps they chart your way back home
Do you wanna leave or something?
