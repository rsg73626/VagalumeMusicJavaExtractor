THE PLEDGE

I pillaged your fairytale
I've scattered the seas to find a reason why
My whiskey tongue leaves sweaty palms
On a sawed off way to say I own the night

Keep your women and children inside, He's looking for a good time


Here lie my darkest passengers
Embodied in my mind is where they all reside
Here lie my darkest passengers
They lie awake tonight until shes put to rest

In search of a sailor, the headlines have said
This man is a monster, a vermin at best
You don't give a fuck that I'm a rat
Give a fuck that I'm a rat

Here lie my darkest passengers
Embodied in my mind is where they all reside
Here lie my darkest passengers
They lie awake tonight until shes put to rest

So bundle up and wrap up tight
My blade the chill in your fright
I'm just a man but I brought a legion of pain
Don't make me, don't make me
I'm feeling a lovers query

Please take my hand, your body's cold and I still see her face
Please understand, I'm giving back
they'll find true love in your loss
And you can be a part of this
And I can be a part of this
You don't give a fuck that I'm a rat
I'm just giving back

True passion a sadistic fiend
Revolver and the lives we lead
So rope me up or take me in
This always starts it never ends
I'm living dead

Here lie my darkest passengers
Embodied in my mind is where they all reside
Here lie my darkest passengers
They lie awake tonight until shes put to rest
