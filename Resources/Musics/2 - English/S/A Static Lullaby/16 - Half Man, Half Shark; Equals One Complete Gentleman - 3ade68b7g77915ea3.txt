HALF MAN, HALF SHARK; EQUALS ONE COMPLETE GENTLEMAN

we'll light up the segway 
we'll load them up and ship them out 
out! out! 

tonight this poet dies 
it isnt closed spoken 
its his last word 
his thoughts were left in fiction 
and his hope for substance 
had faded long ago 

you and i both need to know 
when we fall, you die, we die 
stand there, to get us get us now 
if we fall, you die, we die 
there out to get us now 

tonight the candle was left burning 
and a shred of dignity is lost within the flame 
his cry for silence had faded long ago 

you and i both need to know 
when we fall, you die, we die 
stand there, to get us get us now 
if we fall, you die, we die 
there out to get us now 

tonight this poet dies 
tonight this poet dies 
tonight, tonight, tonight 

you and i both need to know 
if we fall, you die, we die 
stand there out, to get us get us now 
if we fall you die, we die 

we'll light up the segway 
we'll load them up and ship them out 
out! out!
