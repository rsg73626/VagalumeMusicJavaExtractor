WE GO TO ELEVEN

in storybooks children grow up to become leaders
innocence leads our young to fall victim to
(we're not your slaves) 
the disadvantages our parents brought before them
grow up fast and lose sight of becoming an influence
(and i'll never sleep, i'll never sleep again)
they stole our innocence, you broke our foundation
broken by production, released at ten
before you kill your idols, kiss them goodnight
after birth the hand that feeds may bleed
transformers for abuse
(we're not your slaves)
legos build the outcome whether its mental or physical,
before you kill your idols, kiss them goodnight
(and i'll never sleep, i'll never sleep again)
mother i'll bleed for you, as father bled for me...

(1 2 3 4)
before you kill your idols, kiss them goodnight
