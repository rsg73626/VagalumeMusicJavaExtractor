MARILYN MONROBOT

Our little keepsake patterns, the ones that leave us shaking,
Take rest in sound pollution
Take rest in the vibration
A moment with our bodies exposed and decomposing

I'll stay awake to find this fear of lost and losing
Hang on, to whatever that you believe in
(This might mean) This might mean the world to you
But as for me, I've given up on our religion

A safe way (of letting go of nothing)
And they'll lie (why must I do this to myself?)
Why can you say? (I've heard this one a thousand times before)
At daylight (I'll break commitments of the night before)

I'll stay awake to find this fear of lost and losing
Hang on, to whatever that you believe in
(This might mean) This might mean the world to you
But as for me, I've given up on our religion

[interlude]

It's nightfall (it's nightfall) and my liver floats into the stars,
Baby don't ask (don't ask) how it will be when I am fourty
This song is a (and I'll stay awake) a contradiction
And I'm doing just fine

Someone save us from ourselves
Something to cut the ties
A promise that we made
Ashtrays and empty bottles
Someone save me from myself
Something to cut the ties
Our promise that we made
Ashtrays and empty bottles

I'll stay awake to find this fear of lost & losing
Hang on, to whatever that you believe in
(This might mean) This might mean the world to you
But as for me, I've given up on our religion

I've given up on our religion
I've given up on our religion
And I've given up on our religion
And I've given up on our religion
