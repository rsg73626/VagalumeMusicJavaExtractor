FASO LATIDO

break down the pavements 
so line up in our murder call forms 
they line us in stations 
so strip down the last destructions 
green eyes and felt in 
from the toxins that polute our insides 
were drowning (were drowning) 

were watching sunlight burn 
as you slip into through sun again 
were watching the world wide open in flames 
the daylight and the souls 
the night is taking control 
(the night is taking control) 

and this is life twenty years later 
after the dust and smoke have cleared 
after youve lost your wife and children 
when you have passed up the chance of revenge 
a chance to recreate a species 
a soul existence, a perfection at its best 
a pure anarchy. 

stained glass windows 
the lovely way to pass the time 
impair this vision 
to recreate pefection 
slow down transition 
from the moon thats taking over 
were choking 

were watching sunlight burn 
as you slip into through sun again 
were watching the world wide open in flames 
the daylight and the souls 
and its building from a magic stain 
the night is taking control 
(the night is taking control) 

and the moon is taking over 
the moon is taking over 
the night is taking control 

were watching sunlight burn 
as you slip into through sun again 
were watching the world wide open in flames 
the daylight and the souls 
and its building from a magic stain 
the night is taking control 
(the night is taking control)
