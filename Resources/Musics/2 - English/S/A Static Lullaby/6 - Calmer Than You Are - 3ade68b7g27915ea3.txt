CALMER THAN YOU ARE

Tickle me pink with laughter 
Backwards we wind up spinning 
Another shot of whiskey (another shot of whiskey) 
To train our feet to move 

We can't feel loved 
We can't feel free 
We can't feel at all 

(We're taking some time) we can't wait for 
(We're packing our bags) our bags, too full 
Unloved, we'll lose ourselves 
(We're taking some time) we can't wait for 
(We're packing our bags) our bags, too full 
Unloved, we'll lose ourselves 
(Once more we'll lose ourselves) 

We think and drink our cocktails 
Sit and watch the burning bridges 
Throw me another one (roll me another one) 
To train our minds to move 

We're taking some time 

Why can't you set the trucks to sunset 
And we forget 
Ride the sun to make us whole
