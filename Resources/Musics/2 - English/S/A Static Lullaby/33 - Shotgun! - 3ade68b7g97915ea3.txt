SHOTGUN!

We've done our time (we've done what you said) 
Twitch through the night (I wish I was you violation) 
So hold on tight 

I watch her spin out of control (she spins) 
I watch her spin out of control (she spins) 
I watch her spin out of control (she spins) 
I watch her spin! 

And we are the ones who held you tightly 
(the trigger is cold as blood 
and your pain is now my depression) 
And this feels like heaven 

The sin has become a massive piece of mind, 
I guess I ran it over a thousand times in my head, 
I can say I never felt this way 
because your violation was only skin deep 
I've ended your pain and written my own ending 
I'm guilty but flawless 
If this is justice, I'm your jury 
The chamber is loaded 
And now I have the shotgun riding shotgun 

Your open door (this pain will pull me through this) 
That leaves you helpless (this sorry plea that leaves you helpless) 
But life wont wait 

Why can't I just gain control (she spins) 
Why can't I just gain control (and she spins) 
Why can't I just gain control (she spins) 
While I watch her spin! 

And we are the ones who held you tightly 
(the trigger is cold as blood 
and your pain is now my depression) 

This feels like heaven! Heaven! 
A feeling of grief 
But life wont wait 
She spins She spins She spins! 

And we are the ones who held you tightly 
(the trigger is cold as blood 
and your pain is now my depression) 
And this feels like heaven 
And we are the ones who held you tightly 
(the trigger is cold as blood 
and your pain is now my depression) 
And this feels like heaven 
and this feels like heaven 
and this feels like heaven 
And this feels....
