TRIGGER HAPPY TARANTULA

violent strings have buckled down
(i buckle down)
from the weight that it saves
we need a remedy
embody me and kill this shaking emptiness
theses are just fantasies
embalming me
as i sleep

what if you covered the face of the sun
(i am just a man what gives me hope)
of shredding the pain for too long
i'm under the gun
(as i take a breath i'll take the plunge)
the edge tough as nails
as these two cities burn
in the back of our minds
(no will to move
no will to die)

so i guess these tombs lie
more suited for the enemy

behind the curtains reveals a man
(and i'm breaking down)
is it just possibly
revealing me
no time to breathe

what if you covered the face of the sun
(i am just a man what gives me hope)
of shredding the pain for too long
i'm under the gun
(as i take a breath i'll take the plunge)
the edge tough as nails
as these two cities burn
in the back of our minds
(no will to hope
no will to die)

what weathers you
in the night
and if misery shadows fade
when i've been caught
caught living on borrowed time
this is my life
life of most violent screams

(open my eyes
we'll fight this through)
swing by the sway
clench to the thread
this is my life
at the hands of a tarantula
(open my eyes
we'll fight this through
zip up my mouth
the most violent screams)

what if you covered the face of the sun
(i am just a man what gives me hope)
of shredding the pain for too long
i'm under the gun
(as i take a breath i'll take the plunge)
the edge tough as nails
as these two cities burn
in the back of our minds
its almost time
(no will to move)
its almost time
(no will to hope)
its almost time
(no will to die)
