THE PHYSICAL ANTHOLOGY OF VOIDED CONTRACTS

Hey baby run for your life is so precious were always signing contracts
I've got 100 demons I signed 10000 contracts you'll make a beautiful cadaver
You'll make a beautiful cadaver and you're breaking your neck to sign this contract
They rip these threads, they cut like like knives who though paper cuts would destroy our lives
Control control control out of the ashes of voided contracts ive made 1000 corpses i wrote 10000 mistakes you're such a beautiful cadaver
