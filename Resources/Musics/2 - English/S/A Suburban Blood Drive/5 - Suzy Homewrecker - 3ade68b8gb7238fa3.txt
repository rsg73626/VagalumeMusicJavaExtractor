SUZY HOMEWRECKER

Failure is so systematic so she sleeps with a semi automatic
She's a victim she's a sinner she'll scrape the bottom of the barrell break down of our life lines
Relax you're on your own now and she'll spend tonight in the gutter
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah and I'll never trust again
