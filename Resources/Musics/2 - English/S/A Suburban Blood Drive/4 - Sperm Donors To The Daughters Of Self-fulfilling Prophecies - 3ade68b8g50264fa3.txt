SPERM DONORS TO THE DAUGHTERS OF SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECIES

Sperm donors to daughters of self-fulfilling prophecies
Well I'm a ticking time bomb I don't know when I will
go off I'm not a terrorist,
I'm all alone i won't hurt noone well I'm a heretic
sinner I killed my brothers and sisters and if you
want to see their faces you'll have to dig them up
from their shallow graves i'd like to call you but i
don't think that you'd pick up the phone i'd like to
run away but i don't know where i'd go out past the
county line that's where i gave my life thirty rounds
of ammunition but i ain't going down with out a fight
i saw the bullets they're falling and when the smoke
comes i'm crawling and you know when you kill me
you signaled the death of the american dream we want
to be liberated our lives are not free until we lost
everything god damn.
