This town needs an enema a couple of fresh-faced fools to turn it upside down so just take this ticket and meet at the cinema and keep your fucking mouth shut,

they scream the civil defense we build the bombs but the bombs don't build security we're going tear this town down with our own bare hands we've got the right to know (you better bet we know) we'll walk around,
we'll walk around this town like anarchists in a three piece suit anarchists in a three piece suit and now were under your control do you love your god? do you trust the cops?
