VAMPIRES WALKING THROUGH RED LIGHT DISTRICTS

Up all night walk
These streets taking risks and losing sleep the morning comes we cannot donate blood, makes this life so depressing the life you save might be your own waking up after midnight strapping on my cape to make it to her home she had such a pretty face, who'd known she would be such a risk were not in high school anymore the life you change might be your own the life you save might be your own
