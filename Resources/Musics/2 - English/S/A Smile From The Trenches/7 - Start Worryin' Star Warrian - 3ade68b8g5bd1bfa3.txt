START WORRYIN' STAR WARRIAN

Oh
What have I done to you
All of the lies we've been through
And you're just not happy

No
What can I do to make
You believe it's fake
Everything I say to you

This mess has been made and it's been made of you
So just compose yourself before you enter the room
She's just a girl, she's not the world
Don't do something that you'll regret
Take your finger of the trigger
Your dreams won't let you forget

You messed with me girl
Oh how you'll choke on that mistake
Suffocate faster
Your lungs collapsing
By the force

Oh
What have I done to the girl of my dreams
She meant everything, everything
Lifeless and wrapped up in our bed sheets
She meant everything, everything
Love driven murder the thought taste so sweet
She meant everything, everything
Now my anger turned this to reality
She meant everything, everything

Oh what have I done (what have I done)
To the girl (to the girl of my dreams)
Love driven murder
Oh the thought taste so sweet

I'll take my hands and wrap them around your neck
Show you that I'm real and you're completely worthless
You're just a girl you're not the world
You'll soon be someone I regret
Your heart will flat line just give back
Mine you'll look beautiful dead

You messed with me girl
Oh how you'll choke on that mistake
Suffocate faster
Your lungs collapsing
By the force

Oh
What have I done to the girl of my dreams
She meant everything, everything
Lifeless and wrapped up in our bed sheets
She meant everything, everything
Love driven murder the thought taste so sweet
She meant everything, everything
Now my anger turned this to reality
She meant everything, everything

What have I done to you
Your body is lying lifeless here in our room

What have I done to the girl of my dreams
She meant everything, everything
Lifeless and wrapped up in our bed sheets
She meant everything

Oh
What have I done to the girl of my dreams
She meant everything, everything
Lifeless and wrapped up in our bed sheets
She meant everything, everything
Love driven murder the thought taste so sweet
She meant everything, everything
Now my anger turned this to reality
She meant everything, everything

What have I done to the girl of my dreams
