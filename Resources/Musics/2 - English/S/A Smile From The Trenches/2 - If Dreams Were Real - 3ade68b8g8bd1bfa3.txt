IF DREAMS WERE REAL

t's cold out tonight
I'll follow my breath to your front door
You'll be mine in my mind
Forever more

I am the shadow in the night
I am the cracking in the floor
I am the breathing on your neck
The reason why you lock your door

In my dreams
I figured out everything
From the weapon to the place
Now is your chance to scream

You showed me
What its like to be in love
(Whoa whoa) in love (whoa whoa)
My hands are shaking
I get weak from your touch
(Whoa whoa) your touch (whoa whoa)

So let me tell you
Exactly what i did to you
And all the pain that you endured
Before I drugged you in a room

Your body is perfect
Girls would die to be like you
From under the floor boards
I hear your heart beat in that room

In my dreams I figured out everything
From the weapon to the place
Now is your chance to scream

You showed me what its like to be in love
(Whoa whoa) in love (whoa whoa)
My hands are shaking
I get weak from your touch
(Whoa whoa) your touch (whoa whoa)

And now I know
The wrong I've done
I cut you up piece by piece with my tongue
And know I know
The wrong I've done

[Screaming and soft singing]

You showed me
What its like to be in love
Whoa Whoa
You showed me
What its like to be in love
(Whoa whoa) in love (whoa whoa)

My hands are shaking
I get weak from your touch
(Whoa whoa) your touch (whoa whoa)
