NEW YORK IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TONIGHT

Goodbye!

So hold onto it Baby take a deep breath and die
You started of amazing now let me mail you this goodbye
With hands around your throat and your digging in my back
So come on Baby tell me now what is up with that
I watched you through the key hole
As you shedded all your pride
Then you gently ran your fingers on the inside of your thigh

Did you feel me staring through you
Did I make you feel a lie
I'll smile from the trenches
As you lay there and cry [x2]

Lying to me won't help it just fuels the fire when we're done
How long did it take you to (perfect that single tear)
Red lipstick and black eyes won't do you any good
Neither will broken promise rings
With a pair of (hearts to match)

Did you feel me staring through you
Did I make you feel a lie
I'll smile from the trenches
As you lay there and cry [x2]

I'll eat you up girl
I'll make you something so sweet
I'll make you something like a
Delicacy [x3]

Did you feel me staring through you
Did I make you feel a lie
I'll smile from the trenches
As you lay there and cry
