DANI

Do you remember
The night that we first met
You were sitting by your self and I remember
Your hair, your dress, your eyes
The way you looked at me with a smile
I hope you do cause I remember....

I said I loved you and you said it too
I said I loved you

If I go will you go with me
Even if I left tonight?
And leave it all behind
We can build this life together
If you're ready
I never knew love
Was spelt with U and I

Will you remember the things that
We have done when we are old and gray
.. oh by the way you look beautiful tonight
Lets throw caution to the wind
We'll act like kids again
Make it a night to remember...

I said I loved you and you said it too
I said I loved you

If I go will you go with me
Even if I left tonight?
And leave it all behind
We can build this life together
If you're ready
I never knew love
Was spelt with you and I

If I go will you go with me
Even if I left tonight?
And leave it all behind
We can build this life together
If you're ready
I never knew love
Was spelt with you and I

I said I loved you and you said it too
I said I loved you
