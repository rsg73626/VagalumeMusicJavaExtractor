THANK YOU

Thank you for being honest
cause all I wanted was to take your breath away
And when it gets so hardest
I truly promise to keep you by my side and say?

I saw myself a year ago
It's close to what I thought was so
Was I thinking to my surprise?
I think I'm dreaming is this real life If I'm I
Here to make a name for me
If I can believe it I'm a keep my sanity
It'd be crazy to keep my dream alive
Keep me normal and keep me living the life tonight

So I'm not giving up
I will never be the one
I'm not leaving til I've won

Thank you for being honest
cause I wanted was to take your breath away
And when it gets the hardest
I truly promise to keep you by my side and say
You will always carry on
No matter the things they say will stay short
Thank you for being honest
cause I wanted was to take your breath away

Flash forward to a day ago
Reflect on the person that I used to know so close
Was I thinking to my surprise?
I let my guard down for the first time in my life
We were never gonna be the same again
I just wanna tell you that you'll always be my friend
Sayanara I will see you soon
Next time you see me I will be singing in a different tune

So I'm not giving up
I'll will never be the one
I'm not leaving til I've won

Thank you for being honest
cause I wanted was to take your breath away
And when it gets the hardest
I truly promise to keep you by my side and say
You will always carry on no matter the things they say will stay short
Thank you for being honest
cause I wanted was to take your breath away

I will never say goodbye, until the time is right
I will never call it quits, until your alright
I'm never giving in, I wont stop until I win
I will never wont stop until my?

GET THE FUCK UP!
