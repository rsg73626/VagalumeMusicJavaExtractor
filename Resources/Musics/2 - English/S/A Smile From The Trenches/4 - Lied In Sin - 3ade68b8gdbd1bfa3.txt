LIED IN SIN

You thought I died
But my soul was still alive
Inside and out
Screaming for your love
It's what I aim for
And all I ever wanted was in
But it worked out the way you wanted

So burn my body in the fire that you made
And I'm burning within so escape the fate
A tragic heart shed without hope within
Scream your name grab your legs as you walk away

I always thought it was meant to be
But the whole time it was a hateful theme
I'll lay my corpse in the water (so you won't get wet)
I'll smother the flames with my skin (you live in regret)

You thought I died
But my soul was still alive
Inside and out
Screaming for your love
It's what I aim for
And all I ever wanted was in
But it worked out the way you wanted

So burn my body in the fire that you made
And I'm burning within so escape the fate
A tragic heart shed without hope within
Scream your name grab your legs as you walk away

(Escape the fate)

So burn my body in the
Fire that you made
And I'm burning within so
Escape the fate
A tragic heart shed
I'm burning in the flames
Scream your name
Grab your legs as you walk away
