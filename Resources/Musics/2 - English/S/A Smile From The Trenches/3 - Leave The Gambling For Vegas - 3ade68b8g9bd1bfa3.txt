LEAVE THE GAMBLING FOR VEGAS

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

They say the sky was made
Before the stars
And pretty girls made graves
Guess what you're pretty
Lets make it a date

You took for granted
Everything we ever had
Your ran out of good luck
Just made a turn and thats too bad

You're gonna need a casket princess
Cause I can make a mess
Like nobodies business

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

So what do you think about me now
We could have made this work some how
And now your body's drifting out
Where no one will figure out

But not before I tied you up
Lets spell our names out with your blood
Your poker face is just too young
Thats why I'm bleeding out your blood

You're gonna need a casket princess
Cause I can make a mess
Like nobodies business

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

I have you right where I want you
And I can barely breathe (and I can barely breathe)
The reflection in your
Lifeless eyes could be only me

Ooohh
