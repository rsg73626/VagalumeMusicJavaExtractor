SHOW US YOUR SUCESS

So sit there and hide behind you vacant eyes
you'll never realize exactly what your hiding from
wrapped up in you attentions.

By rolling lights flying at me
at full speed in the opposite direction
and all I see is a red collection in the reflection of a mirror
a mirror with used to be.
Carried about what happens in the lives
of others before me.

Whoa-ohhh

Now I'm alone (now i'm alone) you're hiding in your cell
please take the time to remember what you forgot about.
I write these words (i write these words)
that to remind myself of all the things
that I have left behind.

You think you know but you have no idea
this life is harder than like drink.
What do you think that my drink
what do you think about?
The light that guide me
are the same lights that blind me.
Make me act the way i do
I gave yo mines so what's you excuse.
What's you excuse!

Now I'm alone (now i'm alone) you're hiding in your cell
please take the time to remember what you forgot about.
I write these words (i write these words)
that to remind myself of all the things
that I have left behind.

So find yourself that it's something else
other than what feels right.

Now I'm alone (now i'm alone) you're hiding in your cell
please take the time to remember what you forgot about.
I write these words (i write these words)
that to remind myself of all the things
that I have left behind.
