THIS WAIL IS ETERNAL

This wail is eternal
For it has become a piece of me
A devotion seeing to my life-span
In a plight of passion

Believe me
I will listen to the call of my faith

This wail is eternal
No matter how painful it may be
For I will live to dwell in it
With this mate called suffer

This wail is eternal
This wail symbolizes loyalty

our heart has roamed to my proximity
It knows the sequel of our promises
For this wail it recognizes agony
It is illimitable

This wail is eternal
Even if it leads me to my death
For you will live to eat your guilt
...and my regrets will haunt you
