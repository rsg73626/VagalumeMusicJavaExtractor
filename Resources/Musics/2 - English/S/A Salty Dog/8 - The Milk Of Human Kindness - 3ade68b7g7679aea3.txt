THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS

When you knew that i had given all the kindness that i had
Did you think that it might be time to stop?
When you knew that i was through
That i'd done all i could do
Did you really have to milk the final drop?
Not content with my mistake
You behaved just like a snake
And you left me for a wasp without a sting
Tell all my friends back home
That i did it on my own
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling

When you knew that i had given all the kindness that i had
Did you feel you had to break that lonely vow?
When you knew that i was through
That i'd done all i could do
Did you really have to sow that final plough?
Not content with my mistake, you behaved just like a snake
And you left me for a wasp without a sting
Tell all the folks back home that he did it on his own
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling
