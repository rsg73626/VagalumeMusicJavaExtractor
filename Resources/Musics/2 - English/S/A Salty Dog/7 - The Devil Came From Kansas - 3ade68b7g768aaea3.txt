THE DEVIL CAME FROM KANSAS

The Devil came from Kansas. Where he went to I can't say 
Though I teach I'm not a preacher, and I aim to stay that way 
There's a monkey riding on my back, been there for some time 
He says he knows me very well but he's no friend of mine 

I am not a humble pilgrim 
there's no need to scrape and squeeze 
and don't beg fors ilver paper 
when I'm trying to sell you cheese 

The Devil came from Kansas. Where he went to I can't say 
If you really are my brother then you'd better start to pray 
for the sins of those departed and the ones about to go 
There's a dark cloud just above us, don't tell me 'cos I know 

I am not a humble pilgrim 
there's no need to scrape and squeeze 
and don't beg for silver paper 
when I'm trying to sell you cheese 

No I never came from Kansas, don't forget to thank the cook 
Which reminds me of my duty: I was lost and now I look 
for the turning and the signpost and the road which takes you down 
to that pool inside the forest in whose waters I shall drown 

I am not a humble pilgrim
there's no need to scrape and squeeze
and don't beg for silver paper
when I'm trying to sell you cheese
