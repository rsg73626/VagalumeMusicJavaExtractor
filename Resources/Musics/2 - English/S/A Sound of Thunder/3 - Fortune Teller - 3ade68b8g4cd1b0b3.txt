FORTUNE TELLER

Step up to the window
Lonely travelling man
I can see your future
Glimpse the master plan

Maybe rags to riches
Walking tall or sinking
But you'll have to pay me
The devil cards are speaking

Superstitious mind
Looking for an out
There's no road to salvation
There's no time for doubt

One night
This time
You will give me your soul

Crystal ball has spoken
All your dreams are broken
Take a chance
Just lay your money down

Evil spirits haunt you
Seeking to destroy you
And your soul will never be found

Look me in the face
Don't tell anyone
Oh the spells I cast
They cannot be undone
No they cannot be undone

In this sacred place
Only you and I
These ancient words of magic
Make us one tonight

One night
This time
You will give me your soul

Crystal ball has spoken
Your dreams all are broken
Take a chance
Just lay your money down

Evil spirits haunt you
Seeking to destroy you
And your soul will never be found

The fortuneteller telling lies
I see through your cheap disguise
There's no place where you can hide
So far from home
No place to go
And I'll leave you there to die

Your days are numbered you will see
When you think that you are free
I won't leave them any sign
I'll track you down
Sweet revenge
At the end of the line

Crystal ball has spoken
All your dreams are broken
Take a chance
Just lay your money down

Evil spirits haunt you
Seeking to destroy you
And your soul will never be found

The crystal ball has spoken
All your dreams are broken
No final chance
Your world will come crashing down
You'll come crashing down
