HOUSE OF BONES

Speak to me father from beyond the grave
Come to me mother I have found the way
Here in the darkness where they cannot see
Call on the saints to set the spirits free

Bone, blood, and ash offered to the well
Open the doorway from heaven and hell
Mansions like graveyards
Foundations of the past
Death has been turned
And life begins at last

Our legacy was buried
Our names unknown
The bodies may be lost
But their souls live on and on
In the house of bones

Deeper through the swampland
There is music here again
Raging from the house built
On the backs of stolen men
Blood bound to the earth
Where bodies lie in unmarked graves
Two hundred years of servitude
From the children of their slaves

The house of bones will rise
The voodoo in my blood can't be denied
The time has come
For the servants of the past
To rise again and sing with pride
In the house of bones

Harmless little hexes
And a curse upon their name
Their egotistic cruelty
Was the only thing to blame
A plague falls upon the home
And carries loved ones to the ground
The mistress of the house
Is dragged into the swamp and drowned

The house of bones will rise
The voodoo in my blood can't be denied
The time has come for the servants
Of the past
To rise again and sing with pride
In the house of bones

The house of bones will rise
The voodoo in my blood can't be denied
The time has come for the servants
Of the past
To rise again and sing with pride
In the house of bones

You know that judgment
For your sins will come to pass
And you know the tyranny
Of greed can never last
You can't escape the past

The time has come for the lost
Forgotten souls to stake their claim
Rise above, sing, proclaim
They can never erase your name
Your blood cannot be tamed
