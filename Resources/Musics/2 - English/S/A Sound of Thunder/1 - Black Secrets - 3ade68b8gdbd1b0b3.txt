BLACK SECRETS

Silence broken by the whispers
Of the voices in my head
As they guide me past the light
And I crave to be misled

Did you break the sacred seal
Or was it all a dream
Can I deny the blissful madness
Coloring the screams

There's lust, illusion through the void
The light corrupted and destroyed

You can never hide the look within your eyes
When everything you say sounds like a lie
There is truth beyond the faces that they see
Black secrets that you only share with me

First troubled hesitation
For only moments at a time
Eyes opened, looking through the mirror
Reflecting every crime

I fought the urge to run
As the darkness claimed my heart
Days and months I spent in silence
Til your words tore me apart

Enthralled by long forbidden words
Enchantments cannot be unheard

Though in passing I cannot look at your eyes
I know you can see every hidden lie
There is nothing I can hide you cannot see
Black secrets that you only share with me

Conspiring in the darkness
Blind and silent by command
Casting charms and incantations
With the motions of our hands

Enthralled by long forbidden words
Enchantments cannot be unheard

You can never hide the look within your eyes
When everything you say sounds like a lie
There is truth beyond the faces that they see
Black secrets that you only share with me
