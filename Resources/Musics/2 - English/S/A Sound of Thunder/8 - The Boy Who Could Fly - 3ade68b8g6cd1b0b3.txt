THE BOY WHO COULD FLY

Each cold and lonely morning
When the sunlight hits the wall
I wake to find that nothing
Has changed for me at all

I know there was a better time
In a better place
But just like a fading dream
I can't recall your face

As the years pass me by
I can't remember why

Time steals the memories
From before we were apart
But time can't heal
This empty feeling in my heart
Home was the place where we shared a life
But you flew away and you never said goodbye

But there's a fleeting image
That clings still to my mind
Eyes of hope and sadness
Both so artfully entwined

And when the season changes
When the autumn leaves drift by
I try to remember the boy who could fly

What did you say?
Why did you go away?

Time steals the memories
From before we were apart
But time can't heal
This empty feeling in my heart
Home was the place where we shared a life
But you flew away and you never said goodbye

Fly from the window
To the darkness as it calls
Fly through the dreaming night
Stardust as it falls

There's a memory I hide behind a wall
You never really flew away at all
I hear the sirens wailing in the night
In a moment's desperation
You were gone from sight

I see your face in the mirror's glass
Won't you take me with you now at last?
