MASTER OF PAIN

The power is your passion
Control is in your hands
To make one bend the knee
And submit to your command

Sweat and tears and leather
The smell of human dread
Dripping from the skin
As your appetite is fed

Don't show any mercy
It's never the time

Screaming in the darkness
A piercing, haunting wail
Colored by the horror
Of your intoxicating hell

Flashes of the memories
Where pain was just a kiss
Nothing could prepare you
For an ecstasy like this

It's like a resurrection
A turning of the heart
A cardiac infection
Ripping flesh apart

You're a master of pain
With the eternal reign
Of a creature born of fire

Flesh is yours to enjoy
Yours to destroy
All is dark in your desire
Master of pain

I feel your fear is rising
Your muscles start to strain
But your heart is pumping faster
Blood is racing through your veins

The horror of your actions
Has torn your soul in two
It's a testament of fevered lust
That all began with you

Through all your mortal terror
Your hunger comes alive
Animal in nature
I see it in your eyes

You're a master of pain
With the eternal reign
Of a creature born of fire

Flesh is yours to enjoy
Yours to destroy
All is dark in your desire
Master of pain

I know the joy that you feel
Like you're going insane
The only joy that you feel
It lies in the pain

Through all your mortal terror
Your hunger comes alive
Animal in nature
I can see it in your eyes

You're a master of pain
With the eternal reign
Of a creature born of fire

Flesh is yours to enjoy
Yours to destroy
All is dark in your desire
Master of pain
