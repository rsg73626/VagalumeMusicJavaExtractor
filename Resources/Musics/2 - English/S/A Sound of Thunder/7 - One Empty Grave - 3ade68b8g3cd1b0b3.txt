ONE EMPTY GRAVE

Lonely soldier marches on
Cries of battle pierce the air
Feel the heat from the burning sun
All we have is hope and a prayer

Trapped inside the devil's den
Backs against the gray stone wall
Crossfire from everywhere
Look to the sky before I fall

And I know this bloody lane I roam
And I know it will forever be my home

One empty grave
Frozen in time
I will never leave this place
It's my revenge, the perfect crime
Killer's gone without a trace

I've waited a hundred years
Did you think we'd never meet again
A heart of vengeance has no fear
You have nothing left to defend

I see you tremble in front of me
Nowhere to run in the cold winter night
The bloody truth will set you free
When your filthy lies all come to light

And I know this bloody lane I roam
And I know it will forever be my home

One empty grave
Frozen in time
I will never leave this place
It's my revenge, the perfect crime
Killer's gone without a trace

So at last you come to me
Face to face where thousands bled
Eye for an eye
It's your fate
To walk with the undead

One empty grave
Frozen in time
I will never leave this place
It's my revenge, the perfect crime
Killer's gone without a trace
