BROKEN TAPE DECKS

I SPEND MY MONEY TO FAST 
HIP-HOP SURVIVOR YOU KNOW I GET IT LIVER 
AND WHEN I'M PLAYING BALL I'M STILL GETTING PICKED LAST 
MOVE MY WORDS THROUGH THE BEAT LIKE A CHEAP TAXI DRIVER 
BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT BABY BUBBA I'LL BE MAKING SOME CASH 
MY HEROES ARE DE NEIRO, PACINO AND MCGYVER 
AND YOU GONNA CALL ME PIGEON JOHN AND I'M A CALL YOU NOT USE MY THOUGHTS WHEN I SPIT AND I GET DEEP LIKE A DIVER 

OOOOWEEEE JUMP LIKE A CHIMPANZEE 
LITTLE LADY WIGGLING COME SEE ME 
LITTLE DRIBBLE THE RIDDLE IS SYMPHONY 
BOUNCING ON THE WAVES IN THE GREAT DRONE SEA 
COOKBOOK YOU BE GETTING THE FREAKS 
'EVERY SINGLE DAY?' NO EVERY SINGLE WEEK 
NOW THIS IS THE SONG THAT MAKES YOUR GIRLFRIEND DANCE 
AND IF YOU DON'T BUY MY RECORD I GOT MY ADVANCE 

IF YOU'RE BUMPING THIS IN THE KITCHEN, JUST COOK 
IF YOU'RE BUMPING WATCHING US DO IT LIVE LISTEN AND LOOK 
IF YOU'RE BOOGYING TO THE TRACK, JUST DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT 

IF YOU'RE BUMPING THIS IN THE TUB, THEN JUST BATHE 
IF YOU'RE BUMPING THIS WHILE IN TRAFFIC, JUST WAVE 
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FINISH YOU'RE HOMEWORK, JUST DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT 

HOW YOU GONNA TELL THAT SYMPHIN IS EASY 
I WAS CHILLING WITH MY CHICK OUT IN FOX HILLS MALL 
BEEN WORKING REAL HARD NOW I'M ON TV FOR SHEEZY 
THE REAZY WAS BEFORE I HAD A DEEZY 
I KNOW BROTHERS GONNA FRONT WHAT THEY RAPPING ABOUT? 
ME AND JOHN HIT THE STAGE SHARING THE GOOD NEEZY 
THAT'S MOST LIKELY WHY YOU ONLY HEAR THE LADIES SHOUT 

GOT MILK? HOW ABOUT A BEAT THAT'S SMOOTH AS SILK 
AND WHEN I GET A GIRL I WONT' TAKE HER TO THE HILT 
FOR REALT AND WHEN I GET A CAR I'M GONNA DRIVE IT 
WON'T FLOSS IT AND IF I HAVE TO TOSS IT I'LL SURVIVE IT 
AND WHEN I MAKE SOME MONEY I'M A TITHE IT 
AND WHEN I SEE THE SUBWAY I'LL RIDE IT 

AND WHEN I'M JUMPING CLIFFS I HANG GLIDE IT 
YOU EXCITED? WELL ALRIGHT ALRIGHT 

IF YOU'RE BUMPING THIS IN THE KITCHEN JUST COOK 
IF YOU'RE WATCHING US DO IT LIVE, LISTEN AND LOOK 
IF YOU'RE BOOGYING TO THE TRACK JUST DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, 

IF YOU'RE BUMPING THIS IN THE TUB THEN JUST BATHE 
IF YOU'RE BUMPING THIS WHILE IN TRAFFIC, JUST WAVE 
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FINISH YOU'RE HOMEWORK JUST DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT 

YOU ARE NOW LISTENIN' TO THE FISHERMAEN TRANSITION WHEN I BUST YOU CAN TRUST 
EVERY WORD WITH LUST CUZ I STAY FRESHER THAN THE REST OF THEM CATS WHO NEED 
TO ACT LIKE THEY WANNA WIN THE WRESTLIN' MATCH AND PUT THE PEN DOWN I BEND 
SOUND FREQUENCYS FREQUENTLY KNOWN TO BE THE NICEST PRECISE WITH THE MIC IF 
YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY OR JUST DON'T LIKE IT YOU MIGHT GET LEFT JUST LIKE THE HAND THAT I WRITE WITH WORD
