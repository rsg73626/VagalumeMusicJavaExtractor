NEUROBEAT

Candid impression
Obscenties obscured
Apologetically turning away
The awakand stream of thoughts
Hallucination sedatives,
The burden of reset
Supermarket sentiments
I never tried to wipe away the tears
Intensified conclusions
There is no turning back
The charcoal breath of age has stained my face
Salivating, now aroused
The feelings once opressed
Crumbling in the emptyness
In darkness I want to see you fall

Intense movement
Profferring glycerine hopes
Your hands obstruct the words
I want to stay
Neurobeat
Neurobeat
Neurobeat
Neurobeat
I wanna see you fall
