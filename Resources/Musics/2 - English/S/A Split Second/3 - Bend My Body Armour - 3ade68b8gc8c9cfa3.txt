BEND MY BODY ARMOUR

Ripping skin and crushing bones
Head-on collision of shallow cheek bones
Feel the beat creep into your bones
The putrefecation of another night
Alone

Muscles contracted in atrocity posture
Breakdown in a fractured smile
Bite the carpet, bite the dust
Crawl through shit on the brink of lust

Bend my body armour
Bend my body armour
Bend my body armour
Tear it apart

Bend my body armour
Take from the start
Bend my body armour
Tear it apart

Abdominal brainwaves closing in
Turn it over, give it a spin
No more sorrow, no more pain
No tomorrow
Never again, and
Bend my body armour

Scratch my back and I?ll scratch yours
Duet in collision course
Lick the boots that kick your ass
Watch it from the looking glass

No more love and no more hate
No more feelings
Never again, and

Bend my body armour
