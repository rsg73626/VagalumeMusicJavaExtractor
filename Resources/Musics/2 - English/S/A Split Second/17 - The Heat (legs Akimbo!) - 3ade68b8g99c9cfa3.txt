THE HEAT (LEGS AKIMBO!)

Waking up, going to pieces
Tearing plaster off the walls
Flames licking at the edge of your feat
Grinding nails and flashing teeth
Over the edge again
Legs akimbo

Just watch me, touch me
Stroking skin
No deviation, slide it in
Twisting and entangling
Entangling your limbs
Twisting and entangling
Entangling your limbs
Burning the veils of deceit before your eyes
Legs akimbo

Heat...oh

Steaming hours passing by and
Drowning in your sweat
A flick of the wrist and a blow of the tongue Warm, soft and wet
Twisting and entangling
Entangling your limbs
Twisting and entangling
Entangling your limbs
Violently draining the current from our veins
Legs akimbo!
