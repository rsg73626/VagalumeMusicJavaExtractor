The minute I?m coming, I?m up and about
I wanna tear your rhythm down
Your feet keep moving to the beat of the crowd
And I?d love to see you drown
I wanna lick your skin, I wanna suck it in
I wanna tear your rhythm down

Empty bottles and broken shells
I?m gonna hold you till you drop
Moving, falling, slipping fast
Your silk and purring voice won?t last
The pounding in my veins won?t stop
I wanna tear your rhythm down

Baby lies in bubbles
Floating on ice
Waiting for me to hold my breath
Looking for love and sudden death
Just let me wipe your sins off the face of the earth
I wanna tear your rhythm down
