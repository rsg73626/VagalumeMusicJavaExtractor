ARSENIC ON THE ROCKS

Supper time is over for the cannibal tribes
Slice me now
Plastic faces in a meltdown room
Chatter chatter
The glowing of the faces in the acid light
Slice me now
Bend my body, stretch my mind
Trying to be of your kind

Wash away the emptiness
And swallow me, swallow me
The venom of a hundred thousand snakes
Exasperation tears me down
Slice me now
Digging a hole for another conscience
And swallow me, swallow me, all of me
Wash away the emptiness and burn it up, burn it up
And now we explode
Hate incinerating in the acid rain
Drinking boredom, smoking pain
Slipping from my fingers
It's a passionate crime
Closer to your image
A cleansing shrine

Moisture on the cutlery, the taste of our decline
No way to stop me breathing now
The rhythm makes you mine
Gazing down the abyss, there's no sense in going on
Arsenic on either side
Just let me turn to stone
