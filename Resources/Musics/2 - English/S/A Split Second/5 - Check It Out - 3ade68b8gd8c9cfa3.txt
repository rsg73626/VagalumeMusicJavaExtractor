CHECK IT OUT

Old and sage
The mafu cage
The reason to target
But you know you're not alone
You dare not go to bed
There's always someone sneaking up
Watching your every move
The more you look, the more he moves

Where did I leave my hat (head)?
On the bed?

Checking under those broken lies
Check it out
An oriental facelift - mask
What dies inside the hollow cask
Erupture of suspicion breaks your spine
You feed your obssession along the line
Touching, feeling, holding back
Never trust a friendly face
Especially when it's breathing
Down your neck
