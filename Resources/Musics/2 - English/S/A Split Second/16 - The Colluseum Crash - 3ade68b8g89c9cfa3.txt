THE COLLUSEUM CRASH

"No more human sacrifice" she said
I?ll just have a dry martini
Just let me put my underwear in your computer
And we?ll have lots of software babies

Two minutes before she stopped her train of thoughts
She realised she was at the wrong station
She had another taxi for breakfast on
And started breathing out exhaust fumes
And drinking diesel oil

Zulu tribes roaring with exhilarated laughter at Victoria station
Civilisation is not my cup of tea
Even the dogs ain?t free
Suburban gladiators in shoplifter?s battle dress turning Brussels into a monument of excremental architecture
Weltschmerzzz
Herbert Von Karajan am steuerknuppel seines
Sportflugzeuges
Ã¼berall werden die Leistungen dieses Mannes als
Triumphe gefeiert

It takes a man wearing blue jeans
to eat a whole can of jellybeans
