BURN OUT

See her walking gently down the street
Watch her slipping swiftly

She knows the whole damn world is watching her
She couldn't give a hoot in hell
She'll never make the frontpage headlines
She knows the story far too well

Burn out
Taking her chances
Burn out
Backward glances

Her hands still sticky from the night before
What's the difference, it's all she's suited for
Dragging the relics of her emotions down the street
Burned out memories from between the sheets

Rien que rêves morcelées
Le désis, les fleurs maladives
Je ném Peux plus
Les gémissements dans les yeux révulsés
La vie dans les biotes D'ennui
La vie dans les boites D'envie
L'envie...
