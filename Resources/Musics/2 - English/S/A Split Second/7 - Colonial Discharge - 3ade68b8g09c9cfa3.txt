COLONIAL DISCHARGE

Under the incinerating sun,
The sweat of toiling bodies
On the pyramid building site...
The Smell of Buddha, Shiva, Osiris
An intoxicating gas...

Diving in sand
Moving land
Buddha's not drinking sand
Colonial Discharge
The Smell of Buddha, Shiva, Osiris
An intoxicating gas...
Drinking in sand

Heat like lead
Sacrifice set
Snakes are bread
Pharaoh's breath

Tracks of mindless wanderers
Under the desert sun
You tasteless wasted earth people
Crawling before self-destructive deceit
