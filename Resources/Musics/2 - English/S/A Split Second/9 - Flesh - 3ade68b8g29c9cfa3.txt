FLESH

This is when your flesh
Crimson and pale
Withers behind the blackened veil
The vacant flesh
A petrifying look, the choice is easy
The outcome always the same
The shortest way to cardiac arrest
The flesh that dreams are made of doesn't last
This when you turn
To sanctimonius rituals
The duty of the beast
