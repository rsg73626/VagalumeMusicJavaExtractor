LORDS OF THE NIGHT

Filthy lips of life
The touch that hurts your flesh
Cry out: the eternity

The paleness
In your derm
So beautiful like a fatal dawn

Embrace me, I feel cold
Flashes of light fly into me
A kiss and the blood
Saciate me
In the day I feel so sorrowful
At night
I know that I'm immortal

Infernal immortality
So divine
The coldness hardens the breast
Your vitreous tears
won't fall
For this cursed love
The wound that feeds this skin
they in the time

Never will be

We are the lords of the night

Kiss me, saciate yourself
this night
And flee from the beauty
of the light

The god sent
the immortality away....

I feel a sorrowful liking
and (I'm) without life< br />
Wish the heat of a soul
which is on a lake of tears


Now I'm the messenger
of life
And the disgrace of the impures

Embrace me, I feel cold
Flashes of light fly into me
A kiss and the blood
Saciate me
In the day I feel such a sorrow
At night
I know that I'm immortal

The kiss of death...
Like gods of the darkness,

we have the lament
and the eternity in our hands

We are the lords of the night
