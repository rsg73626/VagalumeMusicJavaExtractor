A SORROWFUL DREAM

Endless turns and begins
Resuming everything that was meant to be
Dead ends filled up with needs I care to seek
The barrier of time inside me
It's all a figure-out plan

Rules made from wishes that come and go
An insane hide and seek
Laid dawn with eyes open wide and still
Yet I could not see
Afterall is it just a dream?

Life after life (I breath)
Hereby the time's a high price (I cry)
To pay just to die (I feel)
To live just to die (I smile)

All the broken heart beliefs (I think)
All the dreams you'll never live (I cry)
Hidden sounds in your scream (I seek)
The beginning of your grief (I hide)

The needs you can not see (I live)
The words you can not speak (I find)
They lay down in your mind (I preach)
Claiming for a light sight (I lie)

All the reveries (I wish)
All the pleas we feed (I climb)
Hidden in an inner chest (I reach)
In an everlasting rest (I dive)

Live after live (I insist)
Hereby the time's high price(I'm up)
To play just to die (I resist)
To live just to die (I wonder why)

All the broken heart beliefs (I bleed)
All the dreams you'll never live (I don't mind)
Hidden sounds in your scream (I'm still)
The beginning of your grief (I'm wide)

The needs you can not see (My wills)
The words you can not speak (I sigh)
They lay down in your mind (I'm sick)
Claiming for a light sight (I'm blind)

All the reveries (I sleep)
All the pleas we feed (I fly)
Hidden in an inner chest (I dream)
In an everlasting rest (I die)

I never wake up

Hiding a mean
Hiding a ...
