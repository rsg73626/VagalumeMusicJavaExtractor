LAST WHISPER FROM A WINTER GALE

Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my ordeal
If you think
It’s just a tragedy
It’s my destiny

I bring all the colours
With my rise
Your rise is condemned
By the trees and their leaves
That have already fallen
Fell to rise again
With all flowers
Flowers that are already rotten
In my feet
In my needs
Nevermore For evermore

Now I understand
All the grey in your eyes
World needs
To feel the joy of living
It’s my turn
Wind may blow again

If you could feel 
All my last thousand dreams
You would see all the pain 
Of those who have left
I can feel
Your last thousand dreams
So I can see
Their lives in you

I keep the secrets
Of the night
And spread your crimes
All over lives
God is crying out 
For me and you
Die!

You’ve chosen your path
Among my flaws
In each color
Exists a scar
That is bleeding in me
Forevermore
I’m aware of your disguise!
  
I’ll just make ‘em 
Dry up all their tears
Turned into stones
By your moaning breeze

So when you shall 
Whisper again 
There’ll be hope for all

I bring all the colours
With my rise
Your rise is condemned
By the trees and their leaves
That have already fallen
Fell to rise again
With all flowers
Flowers that are already rotten
In my feet
In my needs
Nevermore For evermore
