THE RIVER THAT CARRIES MY LOSS

The river that carries my loss
Is louder than your cross
To dance with fire in the sky

Each silent scream I moan
Is a passing stream in my roar
To dance with fire
To dance with

She danced with fire
She danced with me
But I was drowned in my tears
To dance with fire in the sky

She danced with fire
She danced with me
But I was drowned in my tears
To dance with fire
To dance with

Now every love hidden in your face
Was taken by this stream disgrace
So it is a fever that is kept in the lake of my eyes

Silent dreams 
Fade away
They are flowing through my lake

Sins became
An only comfort
They are where my dreams will settle on

The river…
All the passion is going through and out my eyes…
All my sins and lies…

I can’t be taken away 
From the way you have turned to
You say no more
And I just go into my tears
The dreams you have lost 
Are not all of your fears
The dreams you have lost 
Are not all of your fears
