THE BRINGER OF LIGHT

Conflicts of feelings
compelled me to come and find out
who's the owner of this inconstancy
the one who brought me down

I brought the light you made me fall
you feared me you cut my flight
now's my rebirth and i understant 
my love for you my father of pain

For each step of yours
there is a different ground
for each note you play
a different sound

You must be one of them
who brought chaos and pain 
it does not matter what i do 
nothing will be enough (for you)

[they] followed me
'cause light blinded them
without me your creation 
would be too perfect
and unreal without flaws

I bring all the pain i hat is necessary
cutting life from the beggining I aughing with humanity
Im the water of the seed of hate i bring wrath and pain
to the souts that were pure once and you will ask me why 
Why?

Why 
you dont understand my burden (cry)
my path of wounds in your hands
I bless the thorns in your crown (cry)

I have my burdens too 
and i still cry for you

sorrow and hate make me strong 
dont cry for me, i choose this way (cry)
heavier than thar cross of wood
is to kill all your believes (cry)

My hate sorrow and doubt 
see all those things
reflected on you

I lie awake on this sky waiting for those screams of wrath
feeding all again and come satisfaction and cry

Conflicts of feelings
compelled me to come and find out
who's the owner of this inconstancy
the one who brought me down

I brought the light 
you made me fall 
you feared me
you cut my flight
now's my rebirth
and i understand
my love for you
my father of pain

What am i supposed to say 
to those who may complain 
it does not matter what i do 
nothing 
will justify (you)

Pain is (the) way to heaven 
without evil your sons
would not be completed
to be human 
is to have the choice

No light without darkness no peace without war
what is love without hate to show you what you have lost again?
i became the shadow i am the unborn and 
i am the emptness that made your god cry and then create all life
