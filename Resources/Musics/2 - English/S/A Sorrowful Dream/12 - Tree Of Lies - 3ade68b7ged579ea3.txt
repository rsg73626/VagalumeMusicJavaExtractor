TREE OF LIES

Fall your way
Which way?
Across the stars
If I can't reach the stars
Bleeding in me
You've chosen my fate
Your way is on dust
And I can't go too far

As a flower caught
in a spring's morning
I'll take your young life away

Oh, why?

All this regret is shalowness
Live now in this garden of beauty

Fall your way
Which way?
Across the stars
If I can't reach the stars
Bleeding in me
You've chosen my fate
Your way is on dust
And I can't go too far

Is it what they call winter dawn?
See no light, feel no strength, only pain
Just like the end of a spring's day
When we know only darkness
And coldness will remain

All your grief will not
Touch my pith (new creation)
I'm the tree of life
And I decide when
Leaves will fall on the ground
And their tears water me
And I can grow up

I'm just another miserable being in your life
Without my strength [I] cannot even cry
How would I serve you? How would I try?
Just one word would be enough for me
To understand why

And the flowers that
Are the most beautiful
[I] take to myself
[to] My private garden
Of lament and colors
Dreaming when one of
You will give me the seed
To make me company

You've take my life away 
just to satisy your needs. 
But your wishes may fail 
once they were born from greed. 
Drown in your own sanity. 
There's the result you'll find. 
You'll have a vast bloomy garden 
without any life.

Fall your way
Which way?
Across the stars
If I can't reach the stars
Bleeding in me
You've chosen my fate
Your way is on dust
And I can't go too far
