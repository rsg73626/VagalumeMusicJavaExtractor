TIMELESS

Means and matters lead us to death since the day we’re born
We plead we beg not 
but life is our last dying hope

We make our lifetime plans
Saving tears for another time, another chance
We keep our lies
In hope we can breathe as long as we still pray
 
Your time now has gone
No praying for your God
Just dress your grief and lie upon me

We give too much
Time for lies

Your path I have done
Since your hope was born
Just be on knees and die for me

The years are gone
Our dreams undone


No tomorrow for each of our days
We keep our lies
In hope we can breathe as they cover our graves
 
Your time now has gone
No praying for your God
Just dress your grief and lie upon me

We give too much
Time for lies

Your path I have done
Since your hope was born
Just be on knees and die for me

The years are gone
Our dreams undone

Your time is a lie
Each second you have spent
Is a step towards my arms

We will never live all our dreams and our hopes
We will never live long enough

You must never dream as long as I’m in your life
If a hope you need for a lie you can’t die
Hitherto you’ve lived thinking of being the one
But the truth is that you are a fool your past is mine
 
Your time now has gone
No praying for your God
Just dress your grief and lie upon me

We give too much
Time for lies

Your path I have done
Since your hope was born
Just be on knees and die for me

The years are gone
Our dreams undone

Your life, your god, your light are slightly dying
I, death, can burn every everlasting hope
Every everlasting crime
