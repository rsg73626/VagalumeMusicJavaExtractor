BODY, MERCY AND MADNESS

You did mouth all my grief and needs
When your hips crashed into me
I eye now better than I did
Under your feet my pleas are faded out

So hold me tighter
It’s all I need
So hold me tighter
Help me to be

You did hand all
my screams and dreams 
And sucked out every human sin
From the truth you have
kept me far
And I’m now nothing but yours

You allow me to die 
When your
heart
Turned to stone

So hold me
tighter
It’s all I need
So hold me tighter
Help me to be

I’m the drug in the blood that flows in your vains
And you just ask for more
And I make fun of your fall while you’re insane

Against your fate 
You can fight 
Pretending that are swords
My bones

And that’s not the way 
You hold me
It’s just the way
You beg for my help

I’m the drug in the blood that flows in your vains
And you just ask for more
And I make fun of your fall while you’re insane

Against your fate
You can fight 
Pretending that are swords
My bones

And there’s love even when there’s
Lust incrusted in your skin
And I make you beg
And there’s no way out
The more I get
The more I want
You gave me your sympathy
But now I long for more…

So hold me tighter
It’s all I need
So hold me tighter
Help me to be
