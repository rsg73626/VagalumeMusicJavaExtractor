IN YOUR DRY LIPS

What can you say?
what did you ask?
you cannot stop me
my lust defies my needs

cold
inside this flesh
but it still warms me
it gives me what i need

my body screams
in sinful pleasure
it's only a wet dream 
in her deep sleep

touch
in loneliness
desire of skin
Innocent and pure

I cannot say a word
you still cant have her soul
how can you find there a confort?

Your tongue so dry, still gives life to my lips
and your eyes, Oh your eyes! so white, still my mirror!
your breast so soft. Forever'll be my bed

Oh, you should let her go
you still can't have her soul
how can you find there a confort?

How long have you left
Oh yes she has gone 
spring has no one more
of its colors
It's just a state of mind

How long have you left 
Oh yes she has gone
and how long i am here
in this madness of insipid possession
Your choice, your waste of time

This war inside 
a disturbed peace in me 
as your eyes spit knives sharper than my breath
it seems like i am lost
lost in my own perversion
as i look into the mirror
i only see you

Oh please now let her go
you'll never have her soul
you'll never find there a confort 

your tongue, so dry...
still gives life to my lips and your eyes, 
Oh, your eyes! so white, still my mirror!
your breast so soft, forever'll be my bed

its so easy to you 
to say all these things
in your side of mirror
but you'll never know
No I'll never know
what a touch means
your lust cannot control
'cause sometimes 
feeling and lust
and avoid you both 
can be even greater than death
of becoming one soul
