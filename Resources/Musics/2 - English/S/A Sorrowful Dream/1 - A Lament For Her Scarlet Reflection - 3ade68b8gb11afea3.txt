A LAMENT FOR HER SCARLET REFLECTION

I tried to
Burn this pages
But they are all washed in tears

In this room
A red bed
Where no one ever could sleep

This grey clouds
Whith thin rain
All over my hidden place

And I close
My mouth
Not to drink this cold water


You've pointed a path that goes nowhere
On the floor I sleep hidden in stones
Waiting for your promiscous way of decay
And I have no dreams
She whispers in your dreams


And so now
Your time has come
To meet my own world

Your body
Beautiful like
An evening storm

But it doesn't 
Have any scars
In your words drawed

And so now
My hands will do
What your touch has done to me

Lies have broken your melody
Scars in you heal the wounds in me


You've pointed a path that goes nowhere
On the floor I sleep hidden in stones
Waiting for your promiscous way of decay
And I have no dreams
She whispers in your dreams


How did you
Open this
Garden of stones
Without names
But with flowers
To remeber
A lost peace
All dead

They never wake up
Nevermore
But their whispers
Still here
In cold winds
Of a spring
That never rise
All dead

A scarlet sin
On the wall
Growing darker
Than your eyes
Falling from the wall
To my womb
Begin for sacrilege
All dead

No sleepless
But no dreams
I can't remember
Any of them
How can I be alive
Without dreams
Or nightmares?
All dead

Fútil foi meu sentimento
Por pensar em felicidade
Já que nada é mais egoísta
Do que a própria harmonia
Que se conquista através de outrem
Pois se eu quisesse seu bem
Nada mais poderia fazer
Do que deixá-la em sua ignorância

It's raining...
