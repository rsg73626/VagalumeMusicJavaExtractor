EMPIRE ON FIRE

I ‘ve sold my heart
For stones
Just to overcome
What I fear
What I really hate

There is no way to live
Except being a crowned clumsy clown
So I got within my sins
Not to become so dumb

I have built my walls with fire
I’d rather live in my hell
I’m a king of an empire
I’ve made with my own hands
(No land, no crown, no queen)
I have built my walls with fire
So when this kingdom fall
I’m a king of an empire
I’ll make myself the queen
(No land, no crown, no queen)

There is no way to live 
Except being a crowned clumsy clown
I’m a king of an empire
In a reign of none

And I figure out a fear
But a fear that will never turn to faith
I’ve built my ruins to dream
Not to become undone

There is no life 
There is no time
In my dreams
Forever
I’ve decided not to live
So you should never
Lay down on my thorns
Because you have to
In life we fear 
[death
And in death we fear to live
Lost in a no return way
We stuck as everything dies

Fly away from me  
I’ve got these chains attaching me to my own safety
You know who I am…
Fly away from me  
Fly even when it seems the best just to wait?
You know who I am…

I bought my heart
For stones
Just to overcome
What I fear
What I really hate

There is no way to live
Despite being a crowned clumsy clown
So I got within my sins
Not to become so dumb

I have built my walls with fire
I’d rather live in my hell
I’m a king of an empire
I’ve made with my own hands
(No land, no crown, no queen)
I have built my walls with fire
So when this kingdom falls
I’m a king of an empire
I’ll make myself the queen
(No land, no crown, no queen)

My own queen
And I’ll never ever have to stand the fear (of another dream)
And I’ll never ever have to stand the dream (of another fear)
And I’ll never ever have to ask myself where I have lost myself

I have built my walls with fire
I’d rather live in my hell
I’m a king of an empire
I’ve made with my own hands
(No land, no crown, no queen)
I have built my walls with fire
‘Couse when this kingdom falls
I’m a king of an empire
I’ll fall in my disgrace
(No land, no crown, no queen)
