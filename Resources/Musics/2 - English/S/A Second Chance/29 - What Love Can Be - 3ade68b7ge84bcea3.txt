WHAT LOVE CAN BE

Start it all w/ a night like this,
And end it with,
A good night kiss.
Close your eyes and let me take you anywhere.
The choice is yours.
You want, you're there

Just don't,
Rush this night so fine.
Don't wory about,
What's on your mind.
Cuz I can't see a reason why,
You shouldn't be,
Here with me.

Lock the doors.
Just you and me. 
Let's just see what love can be.
Hold me tight and kiss me hard.
Drop your guard, cuz' tonight is all for you.

A special night for an oh so special girl.
Tonight we're in your world.
Just take my hand and lead me where you want to go,
Cuz' you know I love you...so..

Just don't,
Rush this night so fine.
Don't wory about,
What's on your mind.
Cuz I can't see a reason why,
You shouldn't be,
Here with me.

Lock the doors.
Just you and me. 
Let's just see what love can be.
Hold me tight and kiss me hard.
Drop your guard, cuz' tonight is all for you.

It's all for you.
All for you.
