HYPNOTISED

[a:] i'm in a trance
Hypnotised
Hypnotised
Hey yeah
Hey yeah

[r:] a funcky rife, a melo beat
Yo're in a trance
Yo're hypnotised!

[a:] no more troubles, no more troubles, music sets me free
'cause the music lives inside of me
No more worries, no more worries music lifts me up
I'm in a trance, i just can't stop.

[a:] i'm hypnotised
'cause the music takes me back in time
I'm hypnotised
No more worries i've got the music on my mind

[r:] tikkie techno to the bone
Tikkie techno to the bone
I'm hypnotised

[a:] hypnotised
Hypnotised

[r:] it's the music now, you can't refuse it
Listen close now, don't abuse it
You're hypnotised as you hear the sound
You lose control you're out of bound
Realize it's twice as nice
You get it free no there's no price
You fantasizeit's in your eyes
You got the feeling, you're hypnotised.

[a:] no more troubles, no more troubles, music sets me free
'cause the music lives inside of me
No more worries, no more worries music lifts me up
I'm in a trance, i just can't stop.

[r:] you flow with the beat you won't let go
It drives you mad in stereo
You're on your own down the zone
Tikkie techno through the bone
A funky riff-- a mellow beat
You get it all, you dance a treat
You're in a trance before you realized
When the music starts you're hypnotised

[a:] hay....

[r:] now dance puts you in a trance
Now dance puts you in a trance
Come on!

[a:] i'm hypnotised
'cause the music takes me back in time

Your hypnotised
