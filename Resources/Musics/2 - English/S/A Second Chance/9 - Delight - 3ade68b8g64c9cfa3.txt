DELIGHT

[ray:] stand right up and be your witness
2 unlimited o'yeah we're the fittest
Moving, don't dare to be a chicken
'cause the bass is so finger licking
Let it move you'll, till it suits you'll
This beat was put here to groove you'll
The a, n, i, t and a
Back to back with the homeboy ray

[ray:] i going to the galaxy like a bomb
Don't wanna come, heh and your dawn
On the scene, a beauty queen
And all the those things you ever dream off
Welcome to it, keep on swiving
'cause you know it's about surviving
Keep yours ears open with the deathtone
'cause we come from the lights just come along

Fills me up with nice sensations
On and on till i can't take no more
Delight is what i came here for
Please let me tell you this
