ETERNALLY YOURS

[ray:] oh baby...
It feels so good to be here with you
We have a love that will last forever
And girl, i want you to know how i feel
'cause i'm eternally yours

[ray:] girl you make me feel so good inside
When you're in my arms and i'm holding you tight
I touch your sweet body with a warm caress
Then i give you love and tenderness
You are like my dream come true
A dream to last my whole life through
Now, and forever more
Baby i'm eternally yours

[ray:] we'll be together 'till the end of time
Every night i'll kiss your body 'till your satisfied
And i'll never, ever let you go
Girl, i'm yours forever more
So wrap my heart in your protection
Let my love be your affection
Just like the sea to the shore
Girl, i'm eternally yours

[chorus:]
[anita:] a love like ours can only last forever
It keeps growing stronger than the day before
I know that we were meant to be together
I want to tell you, too, that i'm eternally yours!

[ray:] people think i'm crazy to feel this way
But i'm in love, what can i say?
The way i feel is my defense
I don't even see my old friends
I just wanna be with you cause this love is strong
I wanna be with you right or wrong
You are all i'm living for
Yeah, i'm eternally yours

[chorus]

[chorus]

[ray:] baby, you're the one that i adore
Let me touch your body when we're on the floor
Girl, i've got a lot of love in store
To give you what you want and even more
You are all i'm living for
Forever like the sea to the shore
Baby, i'm eternally yours, yeah, i'm eternally yours.

[chorus (x3)]
