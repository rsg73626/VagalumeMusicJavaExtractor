I CAN BARELY BREATHE

Tell me girl what were you thinking
hit me with something that'll make this worth my time
take it back, take it all back now,
every promise i made was just another mistake with you
tell the truth if you think that you can take it,
but i know you won't
i never felt so all alone but when it was safe
i turned my back and the blade came through

and i can barely breathe

stand on top of the roof top wonderin'
is it good, yeah it's good for jumpin'
to take back every word you said cuz i can barely breathe

Tell me now can you still taste him
cuz you know you'll never wash your hands of this
take it back, take it all back now,
every drunken kiss that landed on his lips from you
make a move if you think that you can make it,
but i know you won't
i never felt so all alone but when it was safe
i turned my back and the blade came through

hold your tongue, you know nothing about this
don't even get involved
I hope you watch as i'm falling down
because you are the reason i'm hitting the ground
you can be the one that breaks me,
you will be the one that breaks me
I hope you know that every tear you cry
is a memory left from when you watched me die
you know i'll haunt your dreams with all these pieces that you stole of me
