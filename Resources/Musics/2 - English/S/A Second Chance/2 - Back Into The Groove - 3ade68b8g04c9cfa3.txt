Oh yes, we're back!
We're here to remind you

And we're here to stay
We're on attack! leave your worries behind you
We're gonna party 'til the break of day

So come on let's see you move all night

We took some time to get it together
Right down the line to get it complete
Coz now's the time we're back and we're better
