All you have to do, yeah, you know the trick: just escape in the music!

[ray:] woow, uh uh, yeah come on!
[anita:] hehh....

[ray:] i mark the spot when the floor gets hot
Creative enough, easy but tough
The life we living strange and rough
All these situations- man, i've had enough

We gotta get away, gotta disappear
So release your feet and lend me your ear

[ray:] once you're with the music, it becomes addiction
It fascinates like science fiction
You're on a joyride, the tempo ain't slow
Everybody knows that you got to go
All surrounded by musical notes
The mighty dancefloor becomes a road
We gotta get away, we gotta disappear
3-2-1, i'm outta here!

[ray:] we gotta get away, gotta disappear

[anita:] theres sometimes you just need to get away from the troubles and worries of every day
All you have to do, yeah, you know the trick: just escape in the music!

[anita:] don't be lazy
Escape in music!
