HERE I GO

[anita:] ohhh... why don't you catch me?
[ray:] catch me, cause i falling deep down below
[anita:] i'm falling! yeah!

[ray:] there's no way out, man you try to escape
Concentrate on your mind 'cause it might just break
Into half, crack down fast
I keep my face straight no need to laugh
I did some right, i did some wrong
I regret these things, but i gotta stay strong
I feel the pressure, now don't you know?
Catch me, 'cause i'm falling deep down below

[anita:] oh, i can't escape, i'm trapped there is no safe place to go
And i do regret the things i did, but how on earth could i know?
Here i go!

Here i go
Here i go catch me i'm falling falling
Here i go

[ray:] here i go

[anita:] here i go
[ray:] catch me, come on

[ray:] now here's the question any suggestions?
You play it yourself, taught yourself a lesson
Out of your mind you feel like stressing
Searching for answers, you keep on guessing
You messed it up, you're living low
How far you'll go, man i don't know
Come out the dark, i'll bring you in the light
And leave your problems all behind
