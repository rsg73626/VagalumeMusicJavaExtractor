FACES

[anita:] look around you
What do those faces tell you?

[ray:] faces, joy and pain

(chorus)
[anita:] faces
All around different faces i see
Some are happy, some in misery
They express joy and pain
No two faces are the same.

[ray:] people, people all over town
Some of them are poor and others wear a crown
I've seen alot of many faces
Joy and pain in different places
Open your mind, set yourself free
Figure it out, what could it be?
Sympathise, understand
Give love and peace to the other fellow man

[anita:] faces
[ray:] faces, joy and pain
[anita:] look around you
Do you see those faces
What do those faces tell you

[anita:] everywhere i go, different faces i see

Repeat chorus)

[ray:] playing with your life, playing with your soul
You all scream out "i'm the one in control"
Killing of the colours, silly stupid games
You know who you are without no names
Don't mess the world 'cause that the sequal
Open your mind cause we talking about the people
In the world, all kind of places
Different races, different faces

[anita:] different faces, everywhere
