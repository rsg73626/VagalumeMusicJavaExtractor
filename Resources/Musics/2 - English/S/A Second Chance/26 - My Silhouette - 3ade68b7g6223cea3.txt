MY SILHOUETTE

I'm watching your eyes move slowly
Up and down my silhouette.
And I wonder if you get it yet
This is the last time I crawl away on broken knees.
And don't you wish it all would be okay?

Promise me you'll forget me
You said as you walked away.
Don't hold on please let go of me.
You make it so hard to leave.

And I can't breathe without you here
For fear I'll catch your scent.
And we both know how bad I get
I don't do well or dwell in change.
And don't you know that
Three small words could make this all okay.

You promised me,
You'll never forget me.
You promised me,
You'll never forget me.

You promised me.
