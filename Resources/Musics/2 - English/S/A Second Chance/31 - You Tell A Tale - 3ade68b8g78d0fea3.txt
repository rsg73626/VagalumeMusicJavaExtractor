YOU TELL A TALE

I search your words
Fish for breaks in every line
You say you'll paint a picture in my mind.
I'm pay attention to details
And searching for any misleading ideas
You tell a tale, one grand enough to carry me away.

Because I know where you've been
And I know what you've done with him
I hope it's worth what we lost
Take your time with your goodbyes
Because this will be the last time
I sit by with eyes closed tight

And it's hard to know 
If I had caught this months ago
Could have faced myself
Saved myself from this disease
It's killing me faster
With every single second you are gone
You needed an answer
But when I said yes, I meant for ever more.

I look into your eyes and
See that your color's changing,
And I wish that I could change with you.
And when you said forever,
Did you mean it to be true?
Or was it another tale from you?
