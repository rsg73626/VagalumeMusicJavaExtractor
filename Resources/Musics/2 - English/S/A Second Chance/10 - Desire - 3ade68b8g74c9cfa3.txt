DESIRE

[anita:] come closer baby
I wanna touch you
'cause i'm filled with desire
It's burning in the block, with a fever like fire
Desire!

[chrous:]
[anita:] oh... there's something on your mind
When you look across the room i know there's something you can find
Oh... you're on the borderline
When i look into your eyes i know there's something on your mind it's called desire

[ray:] desire!
The call of the heart
Fix you up and dish my apart
Attraction, without satisfaction
Sure ain't enough, cause you want interaction
Now, not a moment to waste
Hunger in you know wanna to be
Pulling at your heart, buring in your bud
With people like fire, desire

[ray:] lust, when your body says much
You can wish at a star, but don't trust luck
If you beaten by book, hooked on the draw
Then look for a girl to share your love
Heaven, where the angelsdon't go
Heaven, where dicks turn to green
It's pulling at heart, ruuning in your head
Makes your skin scream, uh desire!

[chrous]

[ray:] desess
Leave those bodys alone, you got it on your mind and you're not the only one
Attraction, the kiss of introduction
Look into our eyes and the kiss becomes abduction
Here, where the angels don't go
Heaven and nothing but dicks
You playing with your heart, playing with your life
But you know you got to start, desire

[ray:] oh... you fill me up
You fill me up
You fill me with desire
Oh... something on you mind
Something on your mind
Hay... hay...
Oh... burning like fire!

[anita:] yeah! you fill me with desire
You fill me with desire
Hey... boy
Something on your mind
Something on your mind
