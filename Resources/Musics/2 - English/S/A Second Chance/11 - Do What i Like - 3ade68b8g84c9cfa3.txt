DO WHAT I LIKE

[ray:] come let me enter in your brain
You know how it goes no pain, no gain
I'm a rough young brother, i care about another
I thank my life to my dad and my mother
Searching like a hunter, always into something
You wanna be down? first stop fronting
Please don't speak, pass me the mic
Cause no matter what you say i'll do what i like

[ainta:] this is the way i live my life
And there's no need to criticize
This is the way i live my life
And there's no need to criticize
'cause i do, do what i like
This is my life and i'm satisfied
And i do, do what i like
It's the way i live my life!

[ray:] rumours and lies start from the mouth
People hear little things and they start to shout
You see me on t.v. or a magazine cover
Lose our bonus, move under cover
Living that kind of effect, i'm in demanded
I do my thing when i on demanded
You don't even know how i live my life
Don't point your finger cause i'll do what i like

[ainta:] this is the way i live my life
And there's no need to criticize
This is the way i live my life
And there's no need to criticize
'cause i do, do what i like
This is my life and i'm satisfied
And i do, do what i like
It's the way i live my life!

[ainta:] do what you like
