IN YOUR SILENCE

Tell me dear,
How could I make this more clear?
When I say this is forever
And how is that so wrong
Is it too much to ask to not be alone
So what did I do wrong?
I'll take it back and start over again.

Well I fall asleep with you, 
And I wake up alone and unwanted
In your silence.
And I wish I could destroy you
But instead I'll just adore you
And know that you are silent.

I'll cross my fingers tight
And sleep to dream of you.
Cause when I wake
I know I'll be alone,
But it's worth it for you.

And I'd sleep through any dream for you.
And I'd wit through anything.
You're everything to me.

I'm still waiting.
