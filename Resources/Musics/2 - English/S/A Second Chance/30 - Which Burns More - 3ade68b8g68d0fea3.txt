WHICH BURNS MORE

Why can't I win?

Just let yourself go,
In all of your glory.
I'll keep you with me,
In all of your beauty.

If I was the one to say goodbye,
I'd say it so slowly.
Just soft enough to make you cry
Yourself to sleep
Every night without me by your side.
Because you are nothing
Without me, you're nothing.

So, I'll go on repeating you these few words
Because if you want it that's how bad it hurts
To say which burns more
To stay or walk away

Because you were the one to say goodbye
You said it so slowly
Just soft enough to make me cry
Myself to sleep
Every night without you by my side
Because I'm nothing without you, I'm nothing.

And I'm searching
For the words to say to you.
Like I love you and I need you
Yet you won't get the clue
And your green eyes 
Will turn these brown eyes blue
And I'm nothing
I'm nothing without you

Why can't I win
