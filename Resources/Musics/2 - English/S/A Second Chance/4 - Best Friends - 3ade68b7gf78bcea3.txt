BEST FRIENDS

I'm standing on my heels,
My back's up againgst the wall.
This is not the first time I've stood here waiting,
Waiting for your fall.

And I,
I guess it's the first time,
But this is the last time I will try.
And you're not the only girl,
To come along and break my heart.

This is not the way, 
We worked things out to be.
Cuz I thought this was special,
I thought you were different.
Something more to me.

But I,
I guess it's the first time,
that I didn't see this from the start.
And you were the only girl,
To come along and steal my heart.

And you say the best friends are,
The one's who never leave your side.
(Leave Your Side)
I'm trying that hard tonight.
And you say the best friends are,
The one's who would live and die for you.
(Live and Die For You)
Well, I'm dying inside Tonight.
(Tonight.)

I'm dying inside tonight..
