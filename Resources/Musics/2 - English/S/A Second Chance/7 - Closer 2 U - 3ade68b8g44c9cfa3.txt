CLOSER 2 U

I'm gonna get closer to you
Come closer!
I'm gonna get closer to you
Come closer!

I see you watching me boy
Like i've been watching you and
I think it's time that we get down
We're talking big attraction
We're talking interaction
I think it's time that we get down

I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can give you
I'm gonna get closer to you now
I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can bring you
I'm gonna get closer to you now

Closer to you

I'll take you on a journey
You'll see that there's no turning back
Just need a chance and we'll get down
It's time for stimulation
When we're in isolation
I'll make you feel up if you're down

I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can give you
I'm gonna get closer to you now
I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can bring you
I'm gonna get closer to you now

Come closer and closer still
Closer you make me thrill
Moving your body next to mine
Come closer and closer still
Closer you make me thrill
Closer i'll make you feel divine

Closer to you!

I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can give you
I'm gonna get closer to you now
Get closer to you now baby
I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can bring you
I'm gonna get closer to you now
Oh baby, baby baby baby

I'm gonna get closer to you
(closer to you now)
Show you all that love can bring you
(closer to you now)
I'm gonna get closer to you now
Whenever you are near

I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can give you
I'm gonna get closer to you now
I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can bring you
I'm gonna get closer to you now

I'm gonna get closer to you
Show you all the love can give you
I'm gonna get closer to you now
Only, only you!
I'm gonna get closer to you
(closer to you now)
Show you all that love can bring you
(closer to you now)
I'm gonna get closer to you now
Come closer !
