2 UNLIMITED

Refrain:
I wanna scream i wanna jump for joy
And i want everyone to know
I wanna scream i wanna jump for joy
I gotta let the whole world know

Everybody jump jump
Everybody jump jump
Jump for joy
(2x)

I wanna jump for joy - j. o. y.
'cause cupid shot your arrow in the sky
You know the feeling jumping and screaming
Here come the angels marked by demons
You must be dreaming your heart is steaming
Forget the pain and start believing
Butterflies are moving fast
Is this the last love look of the last?
Heavier as ever rhymes quite clever
Respect to the world it's time for whatever
Stimulate the feeling that you've got inside
Hold me down so we can take a ride
Hoaw my month for you to enjoy
Wave your hands in the air and jump for joy

(refrain)

Jump for joy jump for joy
Jump for joy jump for joy
I wanna jump for joy

Everybody jump jump
Everybody jump jump
Jump for joy
(2x)

(refrain 2x)

Jump for joy jump for joy...
(repeat to fade)
