I AM READY

C'mon everybody!
Listen to what i wanna say
I got news for you and it goes this way
Let's start by screamin' and shoutin' it all night long
Cause this is where we all belong

We've got soul in our hearts
We got soul in our blood
And you better believe that we just can't stop
C'mon baby!
C'mon baby!
If you hear my voice, baby let me know!

I am ready!
Yes i'm ready!
Ready for the sound
Ready for the groove
I am ready!
Yes i'm ready!
Let me, let me, let me bust a move!

Oooh, oooh
C'mon
C'mon
Get ready
C'mon
C'mon

You can't fake the feeling
Just be who you wanna be
I'm a part of you as you're a part of me
Cause baby this time we're taking it to the top
And we won't ever let it stop

If you wanna get up, if you wanna get down
I can turn you up and around and around
C'mon baby!
C'mon baby!
If you hear my voice baby let me know!

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

I am ready!
Yes i'm ready!
Ready for the sound
Ready for the groove i am ready!
Yes i'm ready!
Let me, let me, let me
I am ready!
Yes i'm ready!
Ready for the sound
Ready for the groove
I am ready!
Yes i'm ready!
Let me, let me, let me bust a move!
