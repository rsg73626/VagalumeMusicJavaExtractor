DO WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME

I'm movin' on up
I'm doing what's good for me
C'mon...
I'm movin' on up
Just watch me walking out that door

I'm taking my life in my hands
I'm gonna do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

I'm taking my life in my hands
I'm gonna do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

Do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

Do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

Listen up, push it down
This is the booming system sound
Floating around into your town
Open your eyes
See what i've found
Yes i keep it real
Do what i feel
Stop telling me, i know the deal
Female or male, inhale, exhale
No criminal no me never see jail
No more if's
I say no more maybe's
We'll be alright, i tell you baby
Let the leader lead, let the player play
Can you tell the world what we wanna say?

I'm gonna give it on up, give it in,
Give it out, give it all aw...
I gotta let it go, let it out,
Let it loose, let it roll, oh yeah...
You know i'm movin' on up, movin' in,
Movin' out, movin' on aw...
That's what i'm gonna do
That's what i got to do, yeah...

I'm taking my life in my hands
I'm gonna do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

I'm taking my life in my hands
I'm gonna do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

Wanna give it on, give it in
Give it out, give it all
Wanna give it on, give it in
Give it out, give it all
Wanna give it on, give it in
Give it out, give it all

I'm gonna give it on up, give it in,
Give it out, give it all aw...
I gotta let it go, let it out,
Let it loose, let it roll, oh yeah...
You know i'm movin' on up, movin' in,
Movin' out, movin' on aw...
That's what i'm gonna do
That's what i got to do

Yes i made it
I can't be faded
My x-ray eyes are activated
I buzz a rhyme, yo
And i clime, clime, clime
I'm going for gold, yes
I'm going for mine
I'm taking my life in own hands, you see
And doing exactly what's right for me
Nowadays thel all wanna see me
But listen close, they never can beat me

I'm taking my life in my hands
I'm gonna do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

I'm taking my life in my hands
I'm gonna do what's good for me
Do what's good for me

If it's good enough for me
It must be good enough for you
If it's good enough for you
It must be good enough for me

If it's good enough for me
It must be good enough for you
If it's good enough for you
It must be good enough for me

Do what's good for me

Do what's good for me...
