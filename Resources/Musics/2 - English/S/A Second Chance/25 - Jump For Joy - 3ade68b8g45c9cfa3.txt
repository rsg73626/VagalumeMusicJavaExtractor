Jump For Joy 

I Wanna Jump For Joy; J-o-y
'cause Cupid Shot Your Arrow in the Sky
You Know the Feeling, Jumping and Screaming
Here Comes the Angels, Marked By Demons
You Must Be Dreaming, Your Heart Is Steaming
Forget the Pain and Start Believing
Peace and Love Surrounding Earth
Respect to My Mum Who Gave Me Birth
Butterfies Are Moving Fast
Is This the Last Love, the Look of Last
Heavier As Ever, Rhymes Are Quite Clever
Respect to the World It's Time For Whatever
Stimulate the Feeling That You Got Inside
Hold Me Down So We Can Take a Ride
Hoaw My Month For You to Enjoy
Wave Your Hands in the Air and Jump For Joy!
