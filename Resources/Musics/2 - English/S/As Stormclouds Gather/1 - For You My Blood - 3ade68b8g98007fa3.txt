FOR YOU MY BLOOD

For you my blood my veins are still opened
As I lay dying in the hour of dawn
She left me as her thirst was quenched
And sweet her kiss on my frightened skin
Like flames of fire lust's still flowing through myself
And in the shadow she stands waiting for his time (to come)
The final hour of life
And he wants to take my soul away
I opened my eyes for a last time yearning for a glance
She turned her eyes

Looking at me she spoke her words and sweet was her
voice in my ears
"Follow me if you dare to dare to a life in darkness, to pleasure immortal,
to a life without end. As king and queen to rule upon the night
as long as eternity...together"

She left me as her thirst was quenched
And sweet her kiss on my frightened skin
Like flames of fire lust's still flowing through myself
And in the shadow she stands waiting for his time (to come)
The final hour of life
