MUSIC

Music
Music, that's what you are
You're music
You know I can't refuse it
Cause that's what I need from you
It's true

Juices, I'm flowing in your juices
And I'm blowing all my fuses
As you walk a mile in my shoes
Is true

(Chorus)

You take me up so high
And going down
I crashland by your side

You take me up so high
And going down
I crashland by your side

Muses, I'm flying in your muses
You know I can't loose this
I'm holding on to you
For good

You know I've been out looking
For somebody to be soul and body
Love is such a party
It'll lose you
You know I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
For you

(Chorus)

You take me up so high
And going down
I crashland by your side

You take me up so high
And going down, I crashland by your
Side

I want it, I want it
I'm waiting to get on
You know I'm holding on
I'm waiting to get on

(Chorus)
