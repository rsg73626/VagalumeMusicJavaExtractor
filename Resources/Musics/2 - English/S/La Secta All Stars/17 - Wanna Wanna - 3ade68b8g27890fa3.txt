WANNA WANNA

When I see your face,when I see your face
It makes me warmer,when it's cold outside
When I feel your taste,when I feel your taste
I remenber that I'm made of you
I wanna run always,right there by your side
And be always,right there by your side
What I feel inside,what I feel inside
I don't feel no blues

chorus:
You make me wanna holla
You make me wanna wanna
Wanna love you
You make me wanna holla
Wanna love you

You know what to say,you know what to say
When I'm stranded,you help me find a way
Standing in the rain
Waiting for a train that will never come
Want to store away,want to store away
For December,when it's cold and dark
I wanna be right,don't you want to be tight

chorus

And I know it's right,cause it can't be wrong
My heart can't fit where it don;t belong
And all this time and all this space
Your face can't hide what your heart just said
Traveling on this crazy ship of fools
And all I want to be is next to you

chorus
