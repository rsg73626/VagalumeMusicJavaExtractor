SEND THE PAIN BELOW (COVER)

I liked
Having hurt --
So send the pain below,
Where I need it.

You used to beg me
To take
Care of things,
And smile at the thoughts
Of me failing.

But long before
Having hurt --
I’d send the pain below,
I’d send the pain below.

Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating (I’d send the pain below),
Much like suffocating (I’d send the pain below).

You used to run me away
All while laughing...
Then cry about that fact
‘Till I returned.

But long before
Having hurt...
I’d send the pain below,
I’d send the pain below.

Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating (I’d send the pain below),
Much like suffocating (I’d send the pain below),
Much like suffocating!

I can’t feel my chest (chest, chest)
Need more, 
Drop down,
Closing in.
I can’t feel my chest (chest, chest) (RAHH!!!)
Drop down! (RAHHHHHH!!!)

I liked
Having hurt!
So send the pain below,
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating) (I liked...),
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating) (Having hurt),
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating),
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating),
So send the pain below.
