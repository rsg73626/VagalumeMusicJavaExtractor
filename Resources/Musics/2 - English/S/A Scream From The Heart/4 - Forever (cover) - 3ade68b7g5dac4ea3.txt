FOREVER (COVER)

Forever your eyes will hold the memory 
I saw your heart as it overtook me 
We tried so hard to understand and reason 
But in the one moment I gave my heart away 
The perfect breath where my mind lay beside me 
And all I knew is what had overtaken me 
With no explanation 
I am comforted by my inability to understand 
When I wake from this dream will you still be here? 
Will your smile still open my heart 
And leave me trasparent? 

GOD BLESS YOU
