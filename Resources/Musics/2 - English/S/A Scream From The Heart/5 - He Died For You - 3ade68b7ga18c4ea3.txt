HE DIED FOR YOU

My outstretched arms for you
My outstretched heart bleeds for you
A cry rang out, "Crucify the Lord"

and a cry saved my life, "It is finished"
This is Jesus Christ who came to die for you
now sins ripped apart He died for you

I'm free and I love it, I'll fight for this
I thank you God
You're so great
(He was so torn for you
He died though He did not have to and this pain was for you)

He was ripped and torn, spit on
and mocked because you were you
Then He died and rose again just for you to
All the pain within is because you sin for yourself

And Christ is the only one that will bring you through
He died for you
Thank you

God Bless You
