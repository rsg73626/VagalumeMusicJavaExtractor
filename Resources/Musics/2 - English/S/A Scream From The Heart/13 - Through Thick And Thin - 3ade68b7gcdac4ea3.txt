THROUGH THICK AND THIN

Who do you live for, whose side are you on,
Where do you put your faith before the eyes of God?
Will you live for something, or will you die for nothing.
I've made my choice, I'll live for righteousness,
I lift the name of Christ, I won't live by the fear of man,
Or by the threat of war,
This is where I separate myself,
This is where I fight the Tide.
Some are ashamed to say the truth they know,
I will not be swayed, by the high tide,
This is where we change the world,
When the smoke clears where will you be,
Through thick and thin whos side are you on?
The line is drawn, before your feet,
You need to make your choice right now,
This is the time to be a man,
This is the rest of your life,
What is your destiny, will you fight for this?
You've got the chance to make a change.
This is the time to be a man, this is the time to make a change.
