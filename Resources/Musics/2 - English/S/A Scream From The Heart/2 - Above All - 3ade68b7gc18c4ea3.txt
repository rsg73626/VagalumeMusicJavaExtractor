ABOVE ALL

Every morning there’s a warning that you follow
It's getting harder you know
To fill the moments of the morning
They’re so hollow
Fill up on empty and go

And every morning there’s a brokenness you swallow
You try to let go
Of every warning that your wanting, want to follow?
Your signs are starting to show

Chorus:
I can see it in your eyes
You were made to overcome
I can see it in your eyes
You were made to rise above
I can see it in your eyes
So take these wings and fly

And for tomorrow there’s a bottom of a bottle
It's getting harder you know
To dry the problem at the bottom of a bottle
Before it's out of control

(chorus)

And every morning there’s a warning that you follow
It's getting harder you know

(chorus)

God bless you
