LOCKED IN DAILY ROUTINE

I caught my sleep on my trip to self control
(please be careful when you)
Admire and inspire, cause your desire burns your soul
(let him get into you)
It falls apart, a scream from the heart for empathy
(equality, sympathy)
Don't turn your back the road isn't closed yet

But we're all locked in daily routine of life, the road isn't closed yet,
But we're all locked in daily routine of life, daily routine of life

The gates are open you are free to walk along
(as i saw myself in a)
Mirror as big as i was, but something was wrong!
(how could i?)
Look so big as i felt so weak and lonely?
I prayed all night, and felt i was not the only,
The road isn't closed yet
