PSALM 104

(Verse)
May the glory of the Lord endure forever
May the Lord rejoice in his works
He who looks at the earth and it trembles
He who touches the mountains and they burn
(Chorus)
I will sing to the Lord all of my life
I will sing to my God as long as I live
May my meditations please you
As I rejoice in you Lord
Praise you lord forevermore


DON'T FORGET : JESUS LOVE YOU
GOD BLESS YOU
