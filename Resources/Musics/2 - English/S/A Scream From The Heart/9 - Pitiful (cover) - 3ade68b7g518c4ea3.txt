PITIFUL (COVER)

Blindside - Pitiful


as I recall when my stomach turned 
and I was hiding away from myself 
away from you 
like nothing but something was terribly wrong 
and I admit that I was only waiting for the right time (night
time) 
right moment for you to look away 
though you never did I pretended for a while 
so I could walk where I don't belong 

I remember every word you said 
come back in time come back 
and I remember I would soon be dead 
pitiful so pitiful 

but I know as they hammered those nails 
into your beautiful hands 
your eyes they tried to search for mine 
but I look away 
now your eyes are the only thing that can save me 
I'm still afraid of them piercin' 
you break into my prison 
just pretended for a while 
my soul is dying, I won't look away 

I remember every word you said 
come back in time come back 
and I remember I would soon be dead 
pitiful so pitiful 

pitiful 
pitiful 
pitiful 
pitiful 
so pitiful 

and I remember every word you said 
but this time I won't look away 
and I remember every word you said 
and this time I won't look away 

and I remember every word you said 
come back in time come back 
and I remember I would soon be dead 
pitiful so pitiful 

and I remember every word you said (pitiful) 
come back in time come back (pitiful) 
and I remember I would soon be dead (pitiful) 
pitiful so pitiful

(GOD BLESS YOU EVERYBODY)
