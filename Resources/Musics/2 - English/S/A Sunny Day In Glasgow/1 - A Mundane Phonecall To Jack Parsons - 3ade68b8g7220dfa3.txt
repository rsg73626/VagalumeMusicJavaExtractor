A MUNDANE PHONECALL TO JACK PARSONS

Blanche dubois and it started to seem
Like the only things that happened happened in my dreams (in my dreams)
And my dreams they got so big
My head sunk into my chest

Underneath the autumn star
There are days when the dead of us are not so far (samhain)
And i never thought i could injure myself
By sitting still and staring straight ahead

Underneath the autumn star
There are days when the dead of us are not so far
"and that pain in your chest would go away
If you would only go to the movies."

Concentrating on the mundane
The dead among us are not insane.
And i never thought it could be so easy
To talk about nothing all day

No more of this jack for god's sake
You're not the devil
And how about this weather? can you believe it?
"i know"
Sixty-eight in november

Hello, hello
Hello, hello

So i got on my bike
"rode all the way across town"
Please samhain
Factorial be good to me.
