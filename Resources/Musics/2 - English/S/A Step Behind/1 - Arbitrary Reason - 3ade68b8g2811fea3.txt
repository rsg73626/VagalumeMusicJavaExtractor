ARBITRARY REASON

I am all alone and I see you waiting by the phone in my dreams in my dreams put your past on hold I'm dying in side put your blood sweat and tears on a line out to dry cause it's cold in here will someone hit it

Floor, time is fading faster than before innocent mind arbitrary reason why bloody beginnings

I am blind from sounds but I hear the light it's coming near in my dreams in my dreams take your time lay down face flat on the ground take a deep breath in but don't make a sound cause it's cold in here will someone hit it

I take back everything I said
