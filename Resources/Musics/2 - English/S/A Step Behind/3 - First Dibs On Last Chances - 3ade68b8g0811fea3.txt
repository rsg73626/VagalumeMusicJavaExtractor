FIRST DIBS ON LAST CHANCES

I am all alone I have nothing to fear I have been trough it all just by living here put your hands back down I don't want to fight if you judge me now then your mind's not right

Take it out on your own don't bring your problems to me I have had enough only fate will see where I go from here who I leave behind never coming back without peace of mind

This one goes out to you for me for my future not a story told with pictures from the past who's taking count who's keeping track I'm on a roll don't stop me now I'm pulling through I'm coming out I'm on my own with no regrets I'm never wrong but not the best

I am all alone I have nothing to fear I have been through it all just by living here put your hands back down I don't want to fight if you judge me now
