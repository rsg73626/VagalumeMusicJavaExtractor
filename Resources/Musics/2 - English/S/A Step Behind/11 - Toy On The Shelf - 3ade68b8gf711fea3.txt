TOY ON THE SHELF

You and me deserve to be here without you here I couldn't see myself anywhere just a toy on the shelf

Switch your roll tight put your hands in the air I just can't see lets be fair I don't want to make things harder then they are you're not playing by the rules I still can't see bitter cold and when you go outside I will be there oh I'll be there

I can't wait to get out there without you here I couldn't see myself anywhere just a toy on the shelf

Rethink your priorities I have all them straight in line music comes first I will say this every single f*cking time
