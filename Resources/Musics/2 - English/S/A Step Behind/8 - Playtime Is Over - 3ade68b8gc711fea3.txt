PLAYTIME IS OVER

I'm holding the door open to see through how about you I'm tired of waiting for the comfort of pleasure down below I've had enough I take the back routes I know my way don't tell me how I'll figure it out this is harder then you think

Your picture lingers in the mirror I know your past my feelings blinded by the future of sex gone bad I got you off before we started you're way too fast don't tell me how I'll finish you now this is harder then you think

You're not upset this time you're only freaking out on me the future's way too far ahead and memories all I've got instead of all those things I said to you were lies to get you naked to admit it's all your fault that you were wrong I can't pretend anymore with my heart on the floor and my feelings bursting out the seams I wont try one more time cause I'll die in my mind and my confidence is spilling out the sides it's spilling out the sides
