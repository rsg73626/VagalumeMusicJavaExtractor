UNDERSTANDING THE KNOTTY MIND

Your eyes adore me your hands they explore me emotions destroy me Im through
Writing this letter with hopes to forget her it wont be that easy Im told, Im told

I cant take it why dont you go head first and Ill wait my turn to see what you created
Ill be watching waiting taking notes with bottled up opinions sitting right beside me

Righteous and wealthy you tears they compel me Ive got my suspicions on you
Now that youre ready to leave and forget me, Ive lost all ambitions on love, on you

I cant take it why dont you go head first and Ill wait my turn to see what you created
Ill be watching waiting taking notes with bottled up opinions sitting right beside me

Right here I die, my thoughts and fears apart of me

I cant take it why dont you go head first and Ill wait my turn to see what you created
Ill be watching waiting taking notes with bottled up opinions sitting right beside me
