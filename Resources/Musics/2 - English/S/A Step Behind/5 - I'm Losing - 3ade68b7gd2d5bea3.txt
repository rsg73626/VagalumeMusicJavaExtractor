I'M LOSING

One thought one misconception you hold my body close I think Im losing my grip I think Im losing control your fear is my obsession kind hearts inside are cold I think Im losing my grip I think Im losing 
control

These interests kills me and looks they heal my wounds but why this time spent wasted and I feel your pain right now I think Im falling down Im wasting all my patience on you

Unmask your hidden passions this masquerade grows old I think Im losing my grip I think Im losing control deaf ears fall hard on silence attempted shock I know I think Im losing my grip I think Im 
losing control

These interests kills me and looks they heal my wounds but why this time spent wasted and I feel your pain right now I think Im falling down Im wasting all my patience on you/Im losing/we can have tonight
