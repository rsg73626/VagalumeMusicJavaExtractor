TRUTH BE TOLD

Cut the act cause your plays gone too long, intermissions an excuse for whats wrong
Stretch the truth too far it shows, theres a quiver in your voice I know
Whoa, waiting by the phone crushed to get the call decide your fate forever good luck good luck. Broken trust is a hell of a resume, running low on excuses and things to say I dont know who you are Dont lie is there something your hiding from, far fetched like the stories your riding from, I dont know who you are. You think that I would let this slip away, slip away you think that I would let you runaway, runaway

When tragedy strikes as you buckle inside watch your head, watch your head. Take my advice and just run away, run away far from whats right I hate you I hate you Tonight as I sit here and ponder your life as you lie to my face time after time and its killing you killing me why cant you see I hate you I hate you

Why must all your lies, be held inside its in your eyes

When tragedy strikes as you buckle inside watch your head, watch your head. Take my advice and just run away, run away run away far from whats right I hate you I hate you Tonight as I sit here and ponder your life as you lie to my face time after time and its killing you killing me tearing apart cant you see I hate you you you
