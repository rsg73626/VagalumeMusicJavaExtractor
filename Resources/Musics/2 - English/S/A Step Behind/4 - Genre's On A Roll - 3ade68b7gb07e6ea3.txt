GENRE'S ON A ROLL

Looks to kill moves a thrill 
away from funerals outside 
makeup's vain eyes are wide awake from everything but shy 
take your pick fashions host 
styles nothing but a ghost 
feelings gone genre's on a 
roll and taking sides

We will change the world we 
will make them see we will 
open eyes show them who will 
be on the top in the end at 
the finish line tell your 
friends goodbye cause they're 
wasting your time

Empty floors open soars 
soaked in bitter endings why 
feelings die after lies just to justify the right lose the 
fight take a hit taste defeat 
and not a win feelings gone 
genre's on a roll and taking 
sides

Genres on a roll and taking side/empty floors and open soars
