JAILBAIT JUDGEMENT

Don't judge me now I've got a brand new look I'm coming out I'm seeing faces turn around I can't look back I can't look down perceptions are a plus this time but nobody knows it nobody knows I don't live for tomorrow but I live for the now

Who would have thought this time you feed me lies oh how I tried to sway your misconceptions from a running start you stopped my heart I told you how I wanted things you let me down you let me down and judging by the looks of this you put it off

Your lies a fire put it out the ambers glow I have no doubt the heat beneath us keeps us warm your words are like a perfect storm

Don't judge me now I've got a brand new look I'm coming out I'm seeing faces turn around I can't look back I can't look down perceptions are a plus this time but nobody knows it nobody knows it I don't live for tomorrow but I live for the now
