OUT TO GIT MINES

Intro:

Yeah, Step X Step up in here
Yeah, this is Funky Dredds up on the mic
Comin at you one time cos I'm out to git mines, yeah

Oh yes, I'm out to git mi-ines, I thought you knew
I'm kickin it wit the platinum click, Buckdown is my record crew
I'm comin correct wit my intellects, I do what I gotta do
And on the microphone I'm still flexin
and checkin, all the suckers in my path
I'm flippin and rippin the script, WADOH! and givin you whiplash
I'm like the Energizer rabbit, I just keep goin and goin
And when I'm rockin a microphone I just keep flowin and flowin
I'm lettin you know, I don't be wastin my time
I'm makin the greens, by any means, cos I'm out to git mines
I gotta get this, gotta get that, gotta keep cashin in my dividends
Gotta be havin a gang of ends when I'm chillin wit my friends
(Can you spare a dime?) Nigga, I need you to get a job though
(But I don't have the time) Then I ain't emptyin out my chip, bro
I don't be makin them rules about you bein in the shoes you're in
I'm sure that Mcky D's and Burger King is probably hirin
Nevertheless, I'm keepin a count of every chip
I'm out to get what I can get, cos what I want be costin a grip
Yeah, when I be steppin and wreckin a mic on the stage
I got my people on my mind, I'm out to git mines, fool

Chorus: (x3)

Indo, be sure, you got to get what's yours
(I'm out to git mines, I'm out to git mines)
Indo, you know you got to get what's yours
(I'm out to git mines)

Oh yes, I be enquirin to those that be inspirin me
So I can obtain some results in the industry
Thankyou much, as I be earnin my own wealth
Till Omega Day, I will be compensatin myself
See only my ????? increase slowly but surely, you see
I got the ends cos I's be HOT on the M-I-C
It's some of them chicks that I clock from all of my success
A donation to my peoples cos of them, I'm blessed
I, remember back in the day, when I used to be poor
Now I got chips galore and you besta believe I'm out to git more
and then some, I ain't missin out on none
That's why I became an entrepenuer, on the mic, now I got a gang of ones
(Can I get a loan?) Man, you're trippin, where your peoples at?
(But I don't have a home) Here, you better not get no crack
Outta my way, I must commence to get my pay
I got just one thing on my mind, I'm out to git mines

Chorus (x2)

I'm out to git mines, how many times must I repeat it?
If you're not down wit my click, then I might just tell you to beat it
like Michael, Jackson, it's time for some action
I already made up my mind that I'm out to git mines
In the 9-5, my crew be rollin thick, I wanted to make my ends quick
So I'm out doin licks
on whoever, I never take a chance of bein broke
So don't test me, cos you know I ain't no joke
And I hope, you remember the point I'm tryin to get across
I'm out to git mines so I gotta be my own boss
At the crossroads of life, what should I do?
I gotta get mines, I thought you knew
(Here's a telegram) I wonder who that could be from?
(I think it's Uncle Sam) I thought I reported all my income
Oh well, no means, I'll just break em off a chip of my chunk
It's all good cos I still gotta make a hump

Chorus:

I do what I wanna do, when I want to
(I'm out to git mines, I'm out to git mines)
(I'm out to git mines)
(I'm out to git mines, I'm out to git mines)
(I'm out to git mines)
