SHOT TO RIGHT

If you're going to take this 
out on me then look around 
and see who's here and plea your case to me your right 
I'm wrong that's how it is 

I'm going back to broken 
standards by your mind so 
indecisive and your thoughts so contradictive of her heart 
that's mine

Broken glass and used up 
tissues all remains from the 
war they had last night but 
we didn't let it get to us 
too close too far it's sad 
we're going back to broken standards by your mind so 
indecisive and your thoughts 
so contradictive of her heart 
that's mine

When I had my doubts about her I had never second-
guessed we would be together 
now when we first met If 
accepting is not an option 
then I'll have to leave this 
time I'll be back before you 
know it when you change your mind

I'll never lie I've got the proof I'll be sincere I'll 
tell the truth when sunset 
falls I'll be there too I'll 
lie in bed with only you and 
with you I am not content 
instead I'm taken by her 
scent of beauty and maturity 
things leading up to future dreams
