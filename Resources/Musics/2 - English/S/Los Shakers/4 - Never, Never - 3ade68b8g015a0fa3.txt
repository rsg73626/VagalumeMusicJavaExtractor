NEVER, NEVER

I am not the only one who looks for you 
Never, never, never 
Never been the only one 
I have ever asked you to be true to me 
ever, ever, ever 
I have ever asked you 
I want you to tell all your feelings about me 
And never, never, never lie to me 
Now, we’re through so let’s remind the things we’ve done 
And never, never, never, never 
Never, never, never 
They will come again 
(Marimbo?) > solo 
I want you to tell all your feelings about me 
And never, never, never lie to me 
Now, we’re through so let’s remind the things we’ve done 
And never, never, never, never 
Never, never, never 
They will come again
