DON'T PASS ME BY

My heart it longs 
My soul it thirsts for more 
For more of You 
I'm reaching out 
I'm waiting here for more 
For more of You 

Pre-Chorus: 
 
Cause all I want is You 
And all I need is to be here with You  
I'm hungry for Your fire  
I'm desperate, You're my one desire  
Jesus, please dont pass me by 
 
 
I need You more than ever  
I'm thirsty for a touch from Heaven  
Jesus, please don't pass me by 
 
 
 
Bridge:  
Don't pass me by Lord  
I'm desperate for You (5x) 
  
Don't pass me by Lord  
I'm desperate for You (5x)
