THE LONGEST NIGHT (LA LARGA NOCHE)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
After I have a girl like you 
You said ????we’ve been untrue 
Oh,please, try to understand 
And I will 
I will be here my real love 
The real, the true, the only love 
If you let me you will see 
There’s no kind of ??? 
To love me, to love you, to wish you 
I will try to make you glad 
And I know you’ll understand 
That you and me are through with this forever 
Please, come with me tonight 
Tonight with me 
The longest night 
-brief solo- 
Tonight with me 
The longest night 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
