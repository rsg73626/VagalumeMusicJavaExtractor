BREAK IT ALL (ROMPAN TODO)

We want you to come (care?) 
We want you to hear 
We want you to dance 
Dance all night long 
But  when the music starts 
Don't stay there like a fool 
And break it all 
You listen me break it all 
You forget you're tired 
You forget you're sad 
Can I shake and dance 
With friends tonight 
But  when the music starts 
Don't stay there like a fool 
And break it all 
You listen me break it all 
If you're alone and nobody shakes with you 
Oh, please don't mind and shake – oh yeah! 
Now, WE KNOW YOU'RE FINE
Do the shake, do the shake – oh yeah! 
And break it all 
Youlisten me break it all 
We want you to come 
We want you to hear 
We want you to dance 
Dance all night long 
But  when the music starts 
Don't stay there like a fool 
And break it all 
You listen me break it all 
When you're alone and nobody shakes with you 
Oh, please don't mind and shake – oh yeah! 
Now, we're ??? 
Do the shake, do the shake – oh yeah! 
And break it all 
You listen me break it all 
We want you to come 
We want you to hear 
We want you to dance 
Dance all night long 
But  when the music starts 
Don't stay there like a fool 
And break it all 
You V break it all 
And break it all 
You listen me break it all 
And break it all 
You listen me break all
