BABY'S BREATH

If you think i look
pretty tonight,
Then you should of seen
the stars in my eyes
when i was in love
when i was in love
when i was in loooooooooo-
ooooove.

You think i look pretty tonight?
Then you should of seen 
when he was in my dreams
When i was in love
when i was in love
when i was in loooooooooo-
ooooove.

(I cant make out most of this verse.)
His eyes.
Everyone.. Everyone.

If you think i look 
pretty tonight.
Blushing...
When i was in love.
When i was in love.
When i was in loooooo-
oooooooove.

If you think i look,
pretty tonight.
Then you should of seen...
...
When i was in love,
when i was in love,
when i was in loooooo-
oooooooove.
