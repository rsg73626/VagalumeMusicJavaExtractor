I've got a chip on my shoulder
Got a hole in my soul
Got a heart that is broken
And a story that's already been told

Got a hole in my soul
Got a heart that is broken
And a story that's already been told

as my ego shines from inside
Unaware of the best of dirt
lost all my pride
Your eyes seem full of lies
Like I'm bursting from within'

And I'm screaming for help.

You'll fall in love at first sight.
You better rub your eyes.
And take a good look again.
