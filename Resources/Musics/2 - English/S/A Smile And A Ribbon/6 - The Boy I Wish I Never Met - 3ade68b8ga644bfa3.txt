THE BOY I WISH I NEVER MET

He's in every love scene
On the screen
He drives every blue car 
Right through my heart
He's in every song I hear
That I can't listen to
If I look down at my hands
They remind me of

The boy I wish,
I never met.

He's in every love scene
on the screen
He drives every blue car
right through my heart
he's in every song i hear
that i can't listen to
if I look down at my hands
they remind me of...

The boy i wish, 
I never met.

He's in every dream I dream
when I try and catch some sleep
He's in bad songs too
nothing compares to you
Hes the boy with long hair
.....?
If I look down at my hands
they remind me of

The boy i wish, 
I never met.

Heart beats slow when hes not there...
Every... can get him out of my head
He can be in two places at the same time
but wherever he is...

He can never be mine.

Hes in every love scene
On the screen
He drives every blue car 
Right through my heart
Hes on every song i hear
That i cant listen to
If i look down at my hands
They remind me of

The boy i wish,
I never met.

Hes in every dream i dream
when i try and catch some sleep
He's in bad songs too
nothing compares to you
Hes the boy with long hair
.....?
If i look down at my hands
they remind me of...

The boy i wish,
i never met...

never met...

Leave me alone (you are alone)
Leave me alone (you are alone)
Let me be
...?
Or else ill cry..?
Ive never seen him happier
when he said
Goodbye.
