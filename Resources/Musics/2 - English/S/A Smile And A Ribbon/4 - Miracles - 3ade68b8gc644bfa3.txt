MIRACLES

Darling, do you chase your dreams?
honey, do you think theres a heaven?
my love, do you believe
any..

Wish upon a star
Say your bedtime prayers
Blow out the candles
and darling, dream dream dream.

Darling, are you lost in darkness?
honey,...
my love is all you see misery?

Wish upon a star
Say your bedtime prayers
Blow out the candles
and darling, dream dream dream.

Owww!

This must be a dream but
please dont banish.. me
...heaven
cause theres a angel smiling at me
baby i believe {baby i believe}
baby i believe {baby i believe}

baby i believe {baby i believe}
baby i believe {baby i believe}
baby i believe
in miracles.
