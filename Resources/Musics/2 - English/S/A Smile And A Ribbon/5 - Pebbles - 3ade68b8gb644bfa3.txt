PEBBLES

It took so long before I could find my way to his house without getting lost
He lived at (?)
I knew that we were too alike for me to fall for him and then I fell
Well the pebbles crunched and rustled outside every time that sometime passed by...

We never met in the daytime but in the summer the nights are light
We never had trouble talking, somehow things always felt right
He told me this is where his parents had met
I looked out the window and freaked out just a bit
Well the pebbles crunched and rustled outside every time that someone passed by...

I didn't know then what I know now:
Pebbles are awfully shy when they rustle inside your heart
If I hung from a tree beneath his window and he saw that it was me
Would it make him cry?
Well the pebbles crunch and rustle outside every time that someone passes by...
