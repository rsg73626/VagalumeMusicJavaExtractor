SHADES OF BLUE

You see me tonight, arms left out to hold you so tight,
You see me here, eyes are leading hearts without fear,
And then I know, you are here.

Feelings come out, your voice shuns all of the doubt,
You see me now, you can't even tell how much 
I love you, you are here.

So try this, so try me, touch my lips, and you'll see.

Shades of red, of blue, of light, of dark, all of the shades of loves first start,
Out on the bay on the roof tops tonight, you can see at loves first start you are there.
