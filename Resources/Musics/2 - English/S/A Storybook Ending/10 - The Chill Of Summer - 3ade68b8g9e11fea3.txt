THE CHILL OF SUMMER

What should i write about, my life is not so bare
I have let it out this feeling’s not fair
Just let this be and feel your worst
Complacency has taken a turn
The chill of summer starts to burn as this day goes

Memories all but forgetten
Memory will, well its built up
Sometime ago i was tossed and
Just like that, just like that half filled cup

Leaving winter so far behind
Can’t seem to call you mine
I fear now that its time

To call you back cause youre the one
When dust meets dawn on top of the sun.
