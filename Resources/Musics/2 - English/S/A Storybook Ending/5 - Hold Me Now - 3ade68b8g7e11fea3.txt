HOLD ME NOW

let us walk no where just see our facial expressions
look at mine can't you see that i'm bleeding
6 months waiting, 6 months praying
i bit my lips around my teeth guard, retreating
retreating

i'm broken and beating, on the inside i'm beaming
fractured and dying inside, black hearts and filters beside me
a rose once whispered, what i thought love was
but petals fell, as storms embraced 
now i'm displaying my hearts in case of..

don't hold you breath, hold me now
set aflame that feeling, until my lungs stop breathing
don't hold you breath, hold me now
set aflame that feeling, so my lungs stop breathing
hold me now
hold me now

i'm broken and bleeding on the inside, i'm beaming
6 months waiting, 6 months praying
hold me now

set aflame that feeling, so my lungs stop breathing
don't hold you breath, hold me now
set aflame that feeling, so my lungs stop breathing

hold me now
so hoping you would pray
hold me now
hold me now
don't hold me if you dont pray
hold me now
hold me now
