DARK HEIR

Just breathe and I want you to know
With your arms around me I can't start to show
With you everlasting,

Grant me this now,
I can't see as I fall down
Be knowns to me.

As I said you did not exist
this sun warm stirs cold the night air.
The sun rises and we're left betwixt
and the sun light and it's dark heir.

It starts to take flight
Battling night, can't stop this without the dark heir.
As it's on my side, I choose not to hide.
I can't let this night end so go...

Believe in this, I can't do this
I just won't stop this still
And you stand there, just stop right there.
The clocks have to.

Grant me this now.
I can't see as I fall down
Be knowns to me.

As I said you did not exist
this sun warm stirs cold the night air.
The sun rises and we're left betwixt,
and the sun light and it's dark heir.

It starts to take flight
Battling night, can't stop this without the dark heir.
As it's on my side, I choose not to hide.
I can't let this night in so go...

Believe in this, I can't do this
I just won't stop this still.
Can you stand there? just stop right there.
The clocks have to.

Grant me this now.
I can't see as I fall down
Be knowns to me.

It starts to take flight
Battling night, can't stop this without the dark heir.
As it's on my side, I choose not to hide.
I can't let this night end so go...
