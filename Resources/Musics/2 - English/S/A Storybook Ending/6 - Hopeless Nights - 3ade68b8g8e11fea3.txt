HOPELESS NIGHTS

So go today, I will not see you next week, with you there and with me in between,
And then you won't be obligated to talk to those who've left you behind.

I can't tell, if you're even real or are you feign,
Try to judge, those you've left behind,
So look at me, standing in the hollow air and I'm now
Leaving you this time.

And then you will not say that everything's alright,
As you stand there, and swear on hopeless nights that go today

Don't bother me, your eyes are looking vicious overturned
Are those dreams I had of you.
What once were nice, turned into a million nightmares, 
Listen to me, I've got news for you.

These nights shine bright with anger tonight
As I'm calling you tonight
