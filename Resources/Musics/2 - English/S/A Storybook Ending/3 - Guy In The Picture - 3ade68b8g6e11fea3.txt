GUY IN THE PICTURE

when we began
decemeber was something to hold onto
a clear black curtain sky
lined with sequent stars
where we dreamed things seamed so simple
in the meantime, today is now useless
when you already lived a lifetime

you call love devotion
i've seen through your windows
been through your pain (to you he must be something)
enfauation, minor obsession, picture distorted our love had been framed
still shots become your memories

so i ask who's that guy in the picture
the one that's standing next to you
will he be there, when you are broken
do you still dream in blue

dimly lit streets and pale moon air, where we parade
our best fashions as we danced right through the ending
where we dreamed that things seemed so simple tonight
staring at these pictures that i want so badly
share the light

you call love devotion
i've seen through your windows
been through your pain (to you he must be something)
enfauation, minor obsession, picture distorted our love had been framed
still shots become your memories

so i ask who's that guy in the picture
the one that's standing next to you
will he be there, when you are

who's that guy in the picture 
the ones that standing next to you

when we began decemeber was something to hold onto (who's that guy in the picture)
when we began decemeber was something (the one that's standing next to you)

so i ask who's that guy in the picture
the one that's standing next to you
will he be there, when you are
