TASTE THE MERCURY

we're driving past unspoiled road signs gleaming in the moon light to trace edge of that bitter sweet coastline thats keeps us captive by our pupils again captive 'til we get home and baby i know that you haven't seen sleep since ive been gone but i'll keep my promises to you and wake up alone 'til we're there this isn't at all like wind biting our face this isn't at all like winter not at all now the coal burns red and warming every inch of our chests again now the coal burns red its our reminder that this kiss goes on with or without you so stop trying to pretend that you don't love the taste of mercury from my lips eating and beating its way through your veins
