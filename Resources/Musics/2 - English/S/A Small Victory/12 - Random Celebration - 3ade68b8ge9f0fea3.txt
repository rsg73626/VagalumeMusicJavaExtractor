RANDOM CELEBRATION

Give me the chance to stand and weather the storm
don't let the rain clouds drag you down
you're not the only one tossing and turning around
bite your lip and i'll play the fool
cause i know everyway to turn you on
right or wrong i still need you near me
because they keep things far from perfect

but when your breath falls on my neck
I'm content just in your arms tonight
vexed days get hard to bear
but I just look into those eyes
and I search for assurance
that I'm not wasting my time

so maybe you're a bit deranged to think that I should
make this right so your plight 
can throw me down in the dirt and make it hurt
I'll bite my tounge and you're giving in
cause I know every way to turn you on
so let's move on in the heat of passion

I can't stop playing your games
becuase they keep things far from perfect

but when your breath falls on my neck
I'm content just in your arms tonight
vexed days get hard to bear
but I just look into those eyes
and I search for assurance
that I'm not wasting my time

so I could laugh this all away
yeah I'm pretentious to say the least
but you'll get what you want
and that's all that matters in the end
it just gets useless to pretend
that i am living out my days so winsomely
