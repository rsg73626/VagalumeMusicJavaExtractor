BIRDS OF PREY

we haven't burned these bridges for the last time 
so i'll get the gas, you bring the matches. 
we can dowse these threads on our backs. 
no longer birds of prey we are just fuel for this fire. 

this has gone on for too long baby...

broke your heart when the winds got colder, 
broke my neck explaining things i can't explain, yeah.
back and forth, it's always back and forth 
when it comes to you and i.

we haven't burned these bridges for the last time 
so i'll get the gas, and you can bring the matches. 
we can dowse these threads on our backs. 
yeah we can dowse these threads on our backs. 

this is gone...
it feels so wrong yet sometimes it feels so right.
this has gone on for too long baby.

you had to wait for...
you had to wait for it 
and when the moment comes, 
you'll grab my hands and say this could be alright... 
if everything works out. <i>[x2]</i>

but this has gone on for too long baby.

broke your heart when the winds got colder, 
broke my neck explaining things i can't explain, yeah.
back and forth, it's always back and forth, 
when it comes to you and i.

broke your heart when the leaves changed color, 
broke my neck explaining things i can't explain, yeah.
back and forth, it's always back and forth 
when it comes to you and i.

but this has gone on for too long baby.
