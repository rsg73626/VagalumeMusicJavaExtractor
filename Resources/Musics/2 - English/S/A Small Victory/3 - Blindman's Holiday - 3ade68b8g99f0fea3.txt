BLINDMAN'S HOLIDAY

If I could just get out of this town...
Aurora, she can't ignore me now
And i know that you've got a lot of heart to pass around
But i've done a lot of things that you won't ever read
In your books and all your magazines
i've seen alot of places you will never see
Sitting there on your bed desolate daydreaming

You gotta keep your wheels steady racing a blindman's holiday
You gotta keep the even-tides moving on
Cause even with windows down and the warm air in
i still hear our songs. sweet stereo, it's driving me crazy
But "kinda crazy" is the mood i'm in
For now the gloves are off
i've softly spoken every word
But i still hear our songs. sweet stereo, it's driving me crazy
But "kinda crazy" is the mood i'm in for now

So take a seat for another round
The cold air just can't ignore me now
Just fall asleep and await the sounds
They're screaming in my head
But do i ever stop to think when you're all alone
You just close your eyes and you think of me?
Do i ever stop to think that i was wrong all along?
Not a chance in hell, such a wishful dream.

You gotta keep your wheels steady racing a blindman's holiday
You gotta keep the even-tides moving on
Cause even with windows down and the warm air in
i still hear our songs. sweet stereo, it's driving me crazy
But "kinda crazy" is the mood i'm in

Foot to the floorboard
Just ten more miles til we hit the shore and i'm daydreaming
But don't stop cause it's driving me crazy [2x]

Cause even with windows down and the warm air in
i still hear our songs. sweet stereo, it's driving me crazy
But "kinda crazy" is the mood i'm in
For now the gloves are off
i've softly spoken every word
But i still hear our songs. sweet stereo, it's driving me crazy
But "kinda crazy" is the mood i'm in for now
The gloves are off
i've softly spoken every word
But i still hear our songs. sweet stereo, it's driving me crazy
But "kinda crazy" is the mood i'm in for now
