TEDDY DUCHAMP IS NO LOONY

Can you atleast respect this time of silence
Because your the one who killed me after all.
Bolted to the ceiling and im blinded as you pick at my flesh.
Only you hear these voices and only you can hear me cry.

I would sacrifice endless warm nights to see you shattered.
I would sacrifice endless warm nights to see you torn apart.
I will reach for my one and only so i will never be alone again.
