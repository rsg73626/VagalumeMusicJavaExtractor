THEIR LOVERS FALL

sitting here alone at this one stop train station
with nothing to keep my mind at bay 
but the smiles on stranger's faces 
and the moment when I saw your eyes peering through that frosted window 
I swear I felt this scarf get tighter around my neck, around my neck
I swear I felt this scarf get tighter around my neck, around my neck
and now I just sit here waiting

now it seems that I don't even have to try to keep your mouth shut
and you know that I would do anything 
just to hear you scream and break this silence at the top of your lungs 
yet breaking the silence with you is like pulling my teeth out
yeah breaking the silence with you is like pulling my teeth out 
and now I just sit here waiting, 

Now we're spending this years holidays alone 
nothing left to keep us warm, 
nothing left to keep us warm
So we're spending this years holidays alone, 
nothing left to keep us warm, 
nothing left to keep us warm 

but the fire that burns in our guts and we can count the doves 
as one by one their lovers fall, 
as one by one their lovers fall, 
like the fire that burns in our guts, and we can count the doves, 
as one by one their lovers fall, 
as one by one their lovers fall, 
crashing into the ground, exploding in the air, 
as the earth opens up beneath to swallow their empty corpses

so we're spending this years holiday's alone 
nothing left to keep us warm, 
nothing left to keep us warm,
So we're spending this year's holiday's alone, 
Nothing left to keep us warm,
Nothing left to keep us warm,
but the fire that burns in our guts
and we can count the doves, 
as one by one their lovers fall <i>[x5]</i>
