THE PIECES WE KEEP

as your lips turn blue,
it only reminds me i'm not free
from your nightmare that i'm, that i'm living in when grey skies turn blue
i'm holding on to every scream trying to wake you
will you wake up now?

cut up on the floor your arms hold on to me
some how [2x]
but thats all you'll get for now

we can't pretend that this is
and as you turn cold and hold on to me this night because the ground will only break you
like morning skies filled with glimmering sunrise
i'd let you go if i knew that it would break you (knew that it would break you)
that it'd break you

and as your lips turn, every shade of blue
confusing everyone you look at
can you hear me now screaming out your name
i wont give up on this great night
it's the pieces that we keep for ourselves

when his lips wont do, keep mine in mind
it's gonna take time but it's gonna be fine
when his lips wont do, keep mine in mind
it's gonna take time but i'm gonna be just fine

if only you could mean more to me
if only i could keep cool headed
well itss the pieces we keep,the pieces we keep for ourselves
it's gonna be, it's gonna be fine

and as you turn cold and hold on to me this night because the ground will only break you
like morning skies filled with glimmering sunrise
i'd let you go if i knew that it would break you (knew that it would break you)
that it'd break you
