JAMES DEAN B-SIDE

I stare and stare as the words fall from your mouth
ands and buts and I doubt this conversation's going
anywhere with the words you're leaving out

just stare at the ground as the words fall from your mouth
ands and buts and I doubt your alibi and reasons
could satisy your angel's grief cause she dances in the rain
but she would crumble on a sunny day if she heard me
slip a word or two about the things you do
about the things you do, oh no

you, you know you got me thinking 
if i could catch you sleeping out tonight
i'm riding on your lies, don't think that i have never ahd this feeling
don't you ever forget you're being watched tonight... in the corner of my eye

my eyes will look away and my lips won't leak a word if you just say those
words, you and I both know I would kill a man or two, just give me a go
what kind of friend wouldn't put on a knife show? just point him out
I'd do anything for you if you asked me to
I gotta say that i've had i rough

you, you know you got me thinking 
if i could catch you sleeping out tonight
i'm riding on your lies, don't think that i have never ahd this feeling
don't you ever forget you're being watched tonight... in the corner of my eye

oh.i gotta say that i've had it rough
you know i'm a loner born and raised, until i'm dead
he said i'll live it up, i gotta say that i've had it rough
you know i'm a loner born and raised until i'm dead
she said that's so fucked up

you, you know you got me thinking 
if i could catch you sleeping out tonight
i'm riding on your lies, don't think that i have never ahd this feeling
don't you ever forget you're being watched tonight... in the corner of my eye
