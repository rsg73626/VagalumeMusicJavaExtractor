TOMORROW

And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it'll be okay
Yeah, I try to believe you
But I don't

When you say that it's gonna be
It always turns out to be a different way
I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today

[chorus]
I don't know how I'll feel
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
I don't know what to say
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day

Its always been up to you
Its turning around, its up to me
I'm gonna do what I have to do
Just don't

Give me a little time
Leave me alone a little while
Maybe it's not too late
Not today, today, today, today, today
Oh

[chorus]
I don't know how I'll feel
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
I don't know what to say
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day

Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
And I know I'm not ready
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Maybe tomorrow
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
I'm not ready
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Maybe tomorrow

And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it'll be okay
Yeah, I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today
Tomorrow it may change
Tomorrow it may change
Tomorrow it may change
Tomorrow it may change
