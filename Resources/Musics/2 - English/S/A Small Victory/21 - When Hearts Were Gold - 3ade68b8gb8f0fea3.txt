WHEN HEARTS WERE GOLD

We were never ones to give it all up and just let go
And no matter what I can’t help but think of you and I when our hearts were gold
And I remember that new morning when the sun never came up 
And I remember that look in your eyes, remember that look in my eyes
That’s when you thought you lost it all

Lately I’ve been doing some thinking 
I’m sick of hearing my favorite songs play on your stereo
On your stereo
On your stereo

We were never ones to give it all up and just let go
And no matter what I can’t help but think of you and I when our hearts were gold
And every rock seemed to fall into place
And just where we wanted them to 
Those steps were as rusty as our perception of days ahead

Lately I’ve been doing some thinking 
I’m sick of hearing my favorite songs play on your stereo
On your stereo
On your stereo
 
Sometimes we can’t stop the wind from changing
And darling it will be alright if we give it a good fight
Because something’s are worth holding on to forever
Like autumn nights
We can’t let this end
Because it means so much

Lately I’ve been doing some thinking 
I’m sick of hearing my favorite songs play on your stereo
On your stereo
On your stereo

And Lately I’ve been doing some thinking 
I’m sick of hearing my favorite songs play on your stereo
On your stereo

Lately I’ve been doing some thinking 
I’m sick of hearing my favorite songs play on your stereo
On your stereo…
