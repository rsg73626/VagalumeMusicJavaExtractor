LIMOUSINES AND CHEAP CIGARS

Haven't we met before?
I swear those fancy boots have danced
around this simple town before
I said haven't we met before?
I swear I've heard that voice ramble on and on
about limousines and cheap cigars before

the rain hasn't quit since you strolled in
so what's holding those shoulders proud
and what's hanging that chin up with the gray clouds
big shot with a big mouth you better
keep it quiet when your out and about
cause you're the number one to be gunned down

close the blinds, brace the door
that's right, when you sleep
you better keep an open eye at night
you're not alone tonight so
think twice to walk around from under
street lights when you're out
you better keep an open eye at night

the talk hasn't stopped since you strolled in 
and it's killing us slowly, now so...
pack your shit take a bow and get the hell on out
arms crossed against a brick wall you bet i'm
close watching cause you spit when you talk
so hold that tounge and get a head start running

close the blinds, brace the door
that's right, when you sleep
you better keep an open eye at night
you're not alone tonight so
think twice to walk around from under
street lights when you're out
you better keep an open eye at night

you'll hit the road i'll let the bad times roll
into a ditch would sure fix you up <i>[2x]</i>

close the blinds, brace the door
that's right, when you sleep
you better keep an open eye at night
you're not alone tonight so
think twice to walk around from under
street lights when you're out
you better keep an open eye at night
