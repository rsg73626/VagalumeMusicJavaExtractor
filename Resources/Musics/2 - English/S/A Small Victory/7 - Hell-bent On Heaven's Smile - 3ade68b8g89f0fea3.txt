HELL-BENT ON HEAVEN'S SMILE

Valium, blue lights flash and flicker to the beat
callow hearts spark in his burning blood shot eyes
consequence never reared its ugly head quite like this
and he will not be missed tonight one bit
but too heedless to make sense of this
hallucinations and this heave have got him thinking 

am i passed out on the floor?
all i did was ask for one more 
but now i'm only praying all get out of this dive
with a sinking in his chest 
he'll one kill his conscience at best
but now he's only praying he'll get out alive 

the dead weight on his shoulders keep him beat and bruised
bar the windows before the real world crashes in
the sharks will know that it is feeding time
send a signal before their teeth start sinking in too deep and too fast
he's just to slow to escape his past
the dizzy spells and throwing up have got him thinking

am i passed out on the floor?
all i did was ask for one more 
but now i'm only praying all get out of this dive
with a sinking in his chest 
he'll one kill his conscience at best
but now he's only praying he'll get out alive

who are you running from
and what are you running for
don't forget to tip your bartender
and we'll hit the dance floor <i>[2x]</i>

now he's thinking...
am i passed out on the floor?
all i did was ask for one more 
but now i'm only praying all get out of this dive
with a sinking in his chest 
he'll one kill his conscience at best
but now he's only praying he'll get out alive
