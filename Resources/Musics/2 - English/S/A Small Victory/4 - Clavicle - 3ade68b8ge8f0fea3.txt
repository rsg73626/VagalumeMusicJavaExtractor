CLAVICLE

with eyes so stunning tonight, 
you know that you could stop their hearts. 
so be careful not to kill yourself 
with the reflecting images in your room. 

and i will lose you in the emptiest of places. 

right now you mean everything... 
you mean everything to me. 
sometimes your all that i have. (all that i need)
hold on to the times we've got. 
sometimes this life it makes me feel just like...
makes me feel just like

so long as you cross your heart 
that the planets still spinning. 
and will you whisper into my ear?
when we are all just emptier now. 
and i will stare at you from here... 
with the blankest of stares. 
and this i never thought you'd hear me say...
i never thought i'd say this.  

right now you mean everything... 
you mean everything to me. 
sometimes your all that i have. (all that i need)
hold on to the times we've got. 
sometimes this life it makes me feel just like...
makes me feel just like
i could die right now without you.

because theres something about me
like theres something about your skin. 
it cant always be there for you, 
but in the coldest of nights it will keep you warm.

and theres something about me
like theres something about your skin. 
it cant always be there for you, 
but in the coldest of nights it will keep you warm.
 
and theres something about me
like theres something about your skin. 
it cant always be there for you... 
oh it cant always be there for you.

so ill try 
one last time
to tell you...

right now you mean everything... 
you mean everything to me. 
sometimes your all that i have. (all that i need)
hold on to the times we've got. 
sometimes this life it makes me feel just like...
makes me feel just like
i could die right now without you.

it makes me feel just like 
i could die right now without you.
it makes me feel just like i could die.
