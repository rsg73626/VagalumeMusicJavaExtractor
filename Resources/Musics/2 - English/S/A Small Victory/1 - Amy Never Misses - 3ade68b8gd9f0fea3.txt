AMY NEVER MISSES

hey amy, look at your destruction
taking form in reds and whites
to get us through the night
well so long i've got bridges in ruin to rebuild
because amy never misses a target that's shivering
and he said, "I've got a few things figured out
we all get lonely for her now and need her sometimes"

yeah, well i've almost got her figured out
i'm still longing for her now, i need her sometimes
sometimes she holds a dim complexion
the colors left are reds and whites in her swollen eyes
it's been so long since she's been my obsession
but amy always finds her own way to get through to me

scorch the meadows we often found ourselves in
we'll paint them black and gray
with trembling hands we open knives and open ourselves
under the blue light as we become another shade

"I've got a few things figured out
we all get lonely for her now and need her sometimes"

scorch the meadows we often found ourselves in
