HAMMER STRONG

So hear, it’s your last chance to apologize
For all the things I’ve done wrong 
And all these lonely walks I walked alone 
Went through all these terrifying nights I spent alone 

And you know that if I had it all
Every breath of your whispers good night
I would trade it all 
For the wind to sting our blood shot eyes 
And sweep us off our tired feet 
It spins us around so we can see 
If we just walk in circles 

It gets cold on the shore 
And I’m not sure it gets much better where we are going
So buckle up lock 
Your door because here on out I’m driving 
And I’ve got the radio tuned to the last station you cried to 
Well baby it gets warm tonight 
Well baby it gets warm tonight

And then you say we'll bury the hatchet now 
Well there’s a soft spot in my spine 
And you say we'll bury the hatchet now 
Well there’s a soft spot in your spine
With your fist, with your fists through these walls 
And your bones, and your bones through flesh 
Take a look at the mess; take a look at the mess we made

And you know that if I had it all
Every breath of your whispers good night
I would trade it all 
For the wind to sting our blood shot eyes 
And sweep us off our tired feet 
It spins us around so we can see 
If we just walk in circles 

And you know that if I had it all
Every breath of your whispers good night
I would trade it all 
For the wind to sting our blood shot eyes 
And sweep us off our tired feet 
It spins us around so we can see 
If we just walk in circles
