FAREWELL CAPESIDE

the easiest way that I
have found to say goodbye
is to whisper every word
the easiest road that I
can take is on an open highway
just cherish every curve

and I said don't be scared my darling
bare with me for a year
and i'll be home just to say goodbye
and whisper every word in your ear
i'll try to tell it to your ear <i>[3x]</i>
