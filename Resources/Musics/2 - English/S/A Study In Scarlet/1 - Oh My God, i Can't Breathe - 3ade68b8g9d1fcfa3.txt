OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BREATHE

Yeah, I know everything there is to know about these things
Call it what you will
What you wanted
But I'm a liar and it's catching up to me
It's catching up to me

Turn off the search lights
I'm hiding inside myself
And you'll never find me here

One step away
We'll make it out alive again
But it's not up to me, up to me

Flood the streets with color
The battle has begun

It's all a sick and twisted wreck
And I've got it tied around my neck
All the books I've ever read are making sense
Now that it's time to breathe
My eyes are open, but I can't see a thing
But I feel everything

Falling short of all the goals I've ever set for myself
Only tells me one thing
It's not about tomorrow
It's about right this second
And the street lights are dimming
But all I hear are a million voices
Saying, "Breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe

Breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe."
Oh my God, "Just breathe"

One step away
We'll make it out alive again
But it's not up to me

I can't stop this now
