WAIT FOR IT

Put the pieces back together
But it's broken
This isn't something you're ready to admit
Or even to believe
But I've waited way too long
For a change that you can't make

Two sides to every story
And I'm taking it way too far this time
But we only hear what we want to now

Forget the past and get your heart off the floor
Prove yourself

I'm running from my shadow
And I'm hiding inside myself
But I'm changing with the seasons
This is where I belong

I'm taking the princess hostage
So clear the court and get the king on the phone
I'm taking the princess hostage
You might as well have cut the skin to the bone
Oh, that's a bad idea

Two sides to every story
And I'm taking it way too far this time
But we only hear what we want to now

Forget the past and get your heart off the floor
Prove yourself
