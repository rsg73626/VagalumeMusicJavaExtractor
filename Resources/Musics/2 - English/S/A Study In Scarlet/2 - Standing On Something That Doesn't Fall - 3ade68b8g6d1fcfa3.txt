STANDING ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FALL

I know myself
And I will
Decide my fate
I'll make it worth the while

You said you can't forget
But I can't remember
Anything we said
Or what we meant
Or how it feels to be alive
To be alive
But I'm still breathing in the air

I know it's worth it in the end
I know I'll feel it when
My heart stops beating
And you baited the hook that caught my heart
And then you kept me close
As I'm watching the stars burn out
I know I'll hear you say
Come home

Tear down the walls around my heart
Just give me the strength to call you Father
Father, forgive me
Your blood is on my hands

Adonai, Adonai
Your voice is the only thing I hear
Adonai, Adonai
I'm coming home

You said you can't forget
But I can't remember
Anything you said
Or what we meant
Or how it feels to be alive
To be alive
But I'm still breathing in the air

I know it's worth it in the end
I know I'll feel it when
My heart stops beating
And you baited the hook that caught my heart
And then I kept you close
Now as I'm watching the stars burn out
I know I'll hear you say
Come home
