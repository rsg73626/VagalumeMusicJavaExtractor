THE BOTTOM LINE

You said it right when you said
"What's in a name?"
What's in a name?
You bring out the worst in everyone and everything you see
Call it by whatever name you want

You come like a coward
Ready to speak, but never to listen
You draw your conclusions with judgmental eyes
With your false accusations you'll be buried alive

Burn this plague

You said it but you won't see this through to the end
It's everything you asked for
Everything you need

You said it right when you said
"What's in a name?"
What's in a name, what's in a name, what's in a name
What's in a name, what's in a name, what's in a name?

You come like a coward
Ready to speak, but never to listen
You draw your conclusions with judgmental eyes
With your false accusations you'll be buried alive

Fight this to the death
This is a travesty
