JUST GO

Hey!
Hey!
Every time i see you
I think about all the things we used to do.
You say it's not over, i'm all about jealously
I say it is and dont come out to play.


Chorus:
Woah woah go go
Woah woah go go
Awaaaaaay

Just go, i dont want you here, no more.
It been too long.
Just go, it's time you walk right out that dooooor
Just go.

If there's anything you've ever said to make me, make me wanna keep ya.
It's about time that you repeat it. i didn't hear ya the first time round
