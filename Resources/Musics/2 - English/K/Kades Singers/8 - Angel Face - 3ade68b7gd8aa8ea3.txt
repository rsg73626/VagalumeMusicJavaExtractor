ANGEL FACE

It seems that you came from my dream
Sometimes I gotta think you?re not real
An angel face I lose what I mean
Protecting my little heart from evil, no loneliness

My hero I believe you are gonna save me
There?s nothing I can do without your great love
My heart wants to hear
My hero the flowers show being at spring time
The stars and moon seem to be more alive
As a romantic clip please rewind and let me dream

Gonna dream, gonna dream, gonna dream
Until we really become true
I will dream, I will dream, I will dream
Until I wake up beside you
