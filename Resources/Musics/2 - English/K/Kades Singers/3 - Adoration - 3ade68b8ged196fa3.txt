Lord you know my very heart
You know about my feelings
Touch me now, inside my soul, fulfill
Me with your spirit
Forgive-me,Lord,
For all I did, in all I need Forgive me
Lord you are in glory
Lord you are in strenght
Lord you are in power
To whom should I surrend?

l praise your holy name
In truth I shall proclaim
Almighty Lord of all, forever
You're the same
I praise your holy name,
In truth I shall proclaim
I was gifted when I gave you my heart
thats why Im standing here right
Where you are
