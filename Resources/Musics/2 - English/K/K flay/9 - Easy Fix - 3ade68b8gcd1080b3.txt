EASY FIX

Tell you that I'm looking for an easy fix
Watch my mouth stuttering
Whiskey sprite is a decent mix
Try to get my guts to spin
Couple cheap thrills yeah I'm needing it
I don't think I get enough of them
What I did last night don't speak of it
Fucked up yeah I must have been

See it my face, see it in my blood
Memories erased, turn it all to fuzz
Take a photo now while I'm in a pose
Can't remember how, that's the way it goes
Ripping up the pages I rifled though
Know you loved the taste yeah I like it too
Hole inside my chest and it's hard to fill
Consciousness too hard to kill

I don't know if you got a way but I do
I keep my eyes glazed and my mind blank
I don't know if you got a away but I do
I keep my eyes glazed and my mind blank

Had a long night with a friend of mine
Messed up I'm late to work
Everything's wrong try to set it right
But can't seem to get my legs to work
Do it all again like anytime
Oh you just say the word
Got to be my best tonight
Shot the dark, not guessing right
Start again, make it hurt

See it my face, see it in my blood
Memories erased, turn it all to fuzz
Take a photo now while I'm in a pose
Can't remember how, that's the way it goes
Ripping up the pages I rifled though
Know you loved the taste yeah I like it too
Hole inside my chest and it's hard to fill
Consciousness too hard to kill

Take a piece of my heart, tear it off
Let it all fall apart
You can hit me harder than that
Watch it come back around
Did you know silence is, is a sound
I can take it farther than that

At the click of a gun
At a turn of the knife
Said I'd do it just once
Now it's happening twice
Sitting somewhere beneath
See it under the ground
Give it up to the deep
I didn't utter a sound
