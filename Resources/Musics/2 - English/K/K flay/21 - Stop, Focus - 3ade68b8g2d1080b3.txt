STOP, FOCUS

Stop, focus, tell me what I'm looking at
It's hard to tell if I feel good or bad
Fate snapping at my heels like an alligator
You wanna say what's up, I'll call your ass later
Well the situation's grim and I've been in it so many times
That my life's on repeat, feel like a baby minus the weezy

Seinfeld episode on my tv
My mind is filled with blank stares
Abacus is skewed so the math just ain't fair
Perpetual vegetable, turn to my homie like pass the bowl
My brain is now mashable, images so fantastical
My limbs all go spastical, I watch as my mandible
Moves up, up, up, and down down, macking on casserole
If this lasts a full hour I might just be ok
But if not it's like bye bye flay
If this lasts a full hour I might just be ok
But if not then it's like bye bye flay

Stop, focus, tell me what I'm looking at
Stop, focus, tell me what I'm looking at
Life might wring me out to dry
but for now I'm feeling fine
Cancel my engagements, curled up with a blanket
Traveling through space and time
Life might rough me up a bit
but for now I'm feeling good
Wanna tell you everything
but you see all my words misunderstood

Basic situation I am a turkey that's been basting
And thanksgiving was three weeks ago
So I will just be waiting while my
Tryptophan becomes my kryptonite
In an inversion of my destiny so now
The best of me's caught by surprise

My eyes glued I'm blinking elmer's
Need some groceries but I gotta go to hell first
Outburst inward, inside out of mind
In my pocket out of range, I am running out of time
So now let's just blaze away
my mind ain't no place to stay
On stage I might break a leg
I be sharp as a razor blade
Saw the sign call me ace of bass, mj I hit fadeaways
No sleeping I've been wide awake
sweeping up my brain for days

Stop, focus, tell me what I'm looking at
Stop, focus, tell me what I'm looking at
Life might wring me out to dry, but for now I'm feeling fine
Cancel my engagements, curled up with a blanket
Traveling through space and time
Life might rough me up a bit, but for now I'm feeling good
Wanna tell you everything
but you see all my words misunderstood

I'm imminently empty, a cauliflower carrot broccoli medley
No matter what this life is deadly
So I lay in bed and wait for it to come and get me
My spirit set free, yes see
I am heavily into metal
will not be settling for some soft shit
Steadily threading the needle looking
For a piece of my dome but I lost it
Rocker I'm off it, possibly awesome but possibly not
Light years ahead, at this rate I can't possibly stop

Life might wring me out to dry, but for now I'm feeling fine
Cancel my engagements, curled up with a blanket
Traveling through space and time
Life might rough me up a bit, but for now I'm feeling good
Wanna tell you everything
but you see all my words misunderstood
