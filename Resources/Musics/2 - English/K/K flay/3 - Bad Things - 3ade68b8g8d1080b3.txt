BAD THINGS

Drink til I'm dead, toast to my life
Forget about it all in the process
Holding my breath, cold for the night
Difficult to know what the cost is
Call it what you want
Tell me that I'm fucked up
Tell me that I'm wrong, that I'm right

Tell me that I lost touch
Tell me that I'm like him
Tell me that I'm down for the fight
Would anybody care if I woke up
Thought a new day might feel different
Everyone's stripped down, coked up
Thought it might be real, but it isn't
My mind it goes to the darkest places
I've got so much to love, sometimes I fucking hate it

First I felt faded, then it got loud
Next I was wasted, then I blacked out
Said damn, gotta get sober
But it always starts right over
First I felt faded, then it got loud
Next I was wasted, then I blacked out
Not who I seem, I mean like
I've been doing bad things, bad things, yeah
I've been having bad dreams, bad dreams, yeah

Scared that I'll fail, knees in the dirt
Calling up somebody that I don't love
Weaving all my sad tales, even if it hurts
See the beast well it always seems to show up
Call it what you want
Tell me that I'm worthless
Tell me that I'm hype, that I'll blow up

Tell me I'm a fucked up person
Tell me every night that I'm spending on a sofa
Looking way back in the archives, locate the link
Cause I went straight from the hard times
To spitting in a kitchen sink
My mind it goes to the darkest places
I've got so much to love, sometimes I fucking hate it

First I felt faded, then it got loud
Next I was wasted, then I blacked out
Said damn, gotta get sober
But it always starts right over
First I felt faded, then it got loud
Next I was wasted, then I blacked out
Not who I seem, I mean like
I've been doing bad things, bad things, yeah
I've been having bad dreams, bad dreams, yeah

Wish I could steal every moment that I loved
Keep it in a safe place
Cause I can't deal with the stress of the lifestyle
Or the way you're looking in my face
And I wanna get away from it all
But I'm drawn right back, moth to the flame

Everything's better than it's ever
Been but I'm worse for the wear
Yeah it's hard to explain
I want a new name & a little bit
Of something that I ain't got
I want it two ways
like to kill all of my pain with the same shot
I'll be alone forever in my head
Dot my I's til they fill me out

I'll be alone forever in my bed
With a twisted smile and a filthy mouth
I mean like
I've been doing bad things, bad things
I've been having bad dreams, bad dreams
