SO FAST, SO MAYBE

Little did I know shit would get so crazy
So fast, so maybe
I'll get baked on the daily
Put my feet up, let my mind go hazy

Little did I know shit would get this gnarly
This quickly, I hardly
Had time to think
Uh-uh, no time to think

If you like S&M, go choke a bitch
If you wanna just blaze, go smoke a spliff
If you got an envelope, go open it
If you need to urinate, stop holding it
If you're mad fed up, find a bone to pick
And if you wanna get laid, then don't commit
Relax, bubble bath go soak in it
Dead broke, but you got a couple poker chips
Feeling hopeless, cause it's all downhill
From the moment that you're born to the moment that you're killed
Well, at least when you're dead
You could get a little G-d damn rest
See, I've been outta whack since '92
When my folks split up and I came unglued
And I haven't really slept that well since then
Staring at alarm clocks on my nightstands
But now I'm married to the kick drum
Sampling loops like they're dim sum
Tell myself I think I can, little engine
But sometimes it seems like it's all been done

I wanna end on a good note
But damn, I misspoke so
I retract everything I said
Outta rise and shine
Think I'll stay in bed

Little did I know shit would get so crazy
So fast, so maybe
I'll get baked on the daily
Put my feet up, let my mind go hazy

Little did I know shit would get this gnarly
This quickly, I hardly
Had time to think
Uh-uh, no time to think

If you want nice eyes, wear Maybelline
If you need a new friend, pick Rachel Greene
If you wanna act wild, go make a scene
Getting paid over here, baby ching-a-ling
If you're scared to propose, then save the ring
And if he can't hit it right, fake a scream
Life sucker punch might break your spleen
So you better get used to the pace of things
Cause basically, it's like stress non-stop
From the moment that you're born to the moment that you drop
Well, at least when you're dead
You could get a little peace in the head
See, I've been feeling blue since '99
When I realized I'm a slave to time
And the minutes that we got, all limited in stock
When I'm looking at my watch just wasting mine
Ah, caught a glimpse of the action
Since that day, I felt the passion
Don't just talk, go make it happen
Three points in the clutch, John Paxson
But I'm maxing everything out, damn
And the same doubts
Keep weighing on my brain
Outta rise and shine
Think I'll just complain

Little did I know shit would get so crazy
So fast, so maybe
I'll get baked on the daily
Put my feet up, let my mind go hazy

Little did I know shit would get this gnarly
This quickly, I hardly
Had time to think
Uh-uh, no time to think

If you like what you have and you got what you need
If your apartment is the place to be
If you eat sweet crepes or savory
Wanna get in touch so you're paging me
If you stalk down your rival, and break her knee
If you're wandering the earth aimlessly
Tryin' to learn it all, A to Z
But you can't get it up when you lay the D

Well, I suggest you switch your mind state
When people ask you how it's going just say, I'm great
Okay
Well, I suggest you switch your mind state
When people ask you how it's going just say, I'm great
I'm great
