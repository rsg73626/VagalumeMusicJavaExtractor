DOCTOR DON'T KNOW

No matter what you try to do
You're gonna die eventually
Tears inside my eyes I said
I'm scared to fade to black
He replied girl once you see
The light there ain't no turning back
My head hurts, my back too
Nervous breakdowns, already had two
Phone bill way past due

And all I got to eat's chicken katsu
Feeling kinda like a fat dude
My day's just a movie that I sat through
Meaningless sequence of snafus
Got no cash and an ass bruise
Wish I was more like an ashley or a Lindsay
I mean actually maybe deborah or Elizabeth

Life's a motherfucking bitch, isn't it?
Yeah it's fun to be carefree
Til you're clinging to the edge just barely
I have less sex than a mathlete
Wanna know the deal don't ask me
Last night I called the doctor and he said to me
No matter what you try to do you're gonna die eventually
Tears inside my eyes I said I'm scared to fade to black
He replied girl once you see the light
there ain't no turning back

All these folks telling me I'm about to be something big
But you see joke's on them
Sitting in a board room hella bored
Can't hear a thing though my amp's on ten
Mind in a permanent state of flux mental double dutch
Had a bag of cheetos ate em up
3pm and I'm still waking up
Wishing I could save myself, but I'm not brave enough

Sick of all these handshakes
Before I know it every morning bran flakes
How much bullshit can a man take til she finally breaks?
The difference between getting what you want
And what they want is nuanced
So listen baby girl put your boots on
Here's something to chew on
In the end we might go to hell or we might go to heaven
So you might as well cut it out with crisis of faith

Feeling crushed in the dome like a vice to the face
And you might just escape
All the time that you wasted
If you stuck to the basics
Get a grip, buckle up
Take a pill, what the fuck
Last night I called the doctor and he said to me
No matter what you try to do you're gonna die eventually
Tears inside my eyes I said I'm scared to fade to black
He replied girl once you see the light
there ain't no turning back
