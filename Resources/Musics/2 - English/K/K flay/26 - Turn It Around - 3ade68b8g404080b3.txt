TURN IT AROUND

Lately, I've been on a bender
Living on the edges, need to find the center
Least that's what my ex says, told me to remember
Just because you sin, shit that don't make you a sinner
Know a couple sad songs, play em on my Fender
Find something to light up, sleep under the embers

Stressed and indecisive, might have lost my temper
Message in a bottle but it got returned to sender
Gave a guy my number but but then I acted funny
Meanwhile I waited all summer for the motherfucking subway
Now my legs are getting number, wonder
if somebody loves me
Smoke I'd like to bum one, won't be feeling nothing

What I gotta figure, if it hurts is it worth it
Know that I know better, tomorrow I could turn it around
Turn it around
Lately, I've been acting mental
Say I'm too impulsive, need to slow my tempo
Handle full of vodka, mixed it with some Red Bull
Started feeling nauseous, for my daddy puffed a menthol
I would do whatever, whenever, if you said so

Won't forget your birthday, but I'm a fucking mess though
Even at my worst, well, kinda like the best though
Think of where I started, took it to another level
Yeah I got visions of us getting in trouble
Man that sip tastes just like cinnamon
and now I'm seeing double
Hold on give me just one minute, pack my shit into a duffle
Drive me far enough and I'll admit I love you

What I gotta figure, if it hurts is it worth it
Know that I know better, tomorrow I could turn it around
What I gotta figure, if it hurts is it worth it
Know that I know better, tomorrow I could turn it around
Turn it around

Lose my faith, gotta borrow some
We go higher, we go higher
New mistakes when tomorrow comes
We go higher, we go higher
Said too much and I went too far
We go higher, we go higher
Down on luck, well that's all we are
We go higher, we go higher

What I gotta figure, if it hurts is it worth it
Know that I know better, tomorrow I could turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
We go higher, we go higher
