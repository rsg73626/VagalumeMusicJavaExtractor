MAKE ME FADE

Don't think I've been this nervous with a cold drink
In my two hands, saying no thanks
Like any way it goes cause I know things
They shouldn't have told me
Now I'm thinking what for
Hanging by a sentence at the drug store
Barely even steady out the front door
Hate my own shit, but I love yours
Fuck I really love yours

7 In the afternoon, half asleep, count the cars
All I think about is you constantly, that's the hard part
Static on the line, I hear it all the time
But I'm quiet when you make me fade
Feel it coming back, watch it turn to black
But I'm brighter when you make me fade
You make me fade, you make me fade
You make me brighter when you make me fade

Tangled, found myself waking in the same clothes
Shaking from my temple to my ankles
Sunny but I need another raincoat
Waiting by a payphone
Finally I coughed up some awful information
that I thought up
Well they think I've been messing with the wrong stuff
Nah I've been messing with the right shit
Yeah I fucking like it

Waiting for the call to come, who could say it was easy
Sad about the bad I've done, on my grave
please believe me
Static on the line, I hear it all the time
But I'm quiet when you make me fade
Feel it coming back, watch it turn to black
But I'm brighter when you make me fade
You make me fade, you make me fade
You make me brighter when you make me fade

Swear I've been trying to reach you I'm dying
You kill me why you keep your phone all on silent
Recognize my role, I fucked up the timing
But you and I lately been acting like islands
Make a girl wanna get stupid and violent
But silently I've been eyeing the horizon
Patterns repeat, it shouldn't be surprising

You know you make me
You make me fade, you make me fade
You make me brighter when you make me fade
You make me fade, you make me fade
You make me brighter when you make me fade
Static on the line, I hear it all the time
But I'm quiet when you make me fade
Feel it coming back, watch it turn to black
But I'm brighter when you make me fade
