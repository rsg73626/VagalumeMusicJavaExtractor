I'M GOOD

Hopped in the back of a car, accepted an offer
To go get fucked up in some random bar
way outside of boston
Left hand covered with various scars
don't know how I got them
Mind all dissected in separate parts
but I'm feeling awesome
Never met one of them before, yet is seems simple
Run out so I'll get some more, both hands out the window
Feels like he's a friend for sure, talk comes easy
Go and take my temperature, just want you to need me

You know I'm focused, so I'll never fade away
See I'm hopeless, but I'm hoping that you'll stay
So here's a toast to all the friends I made today
Probably stab me in my back, but it's still too soon to say

No rush, I'm good, good, good
Go nuts, we should, should, should
Fell back and he can't get up, I'm good
Won't stop til I catch that buzz, I'm good
No rush, I'm good, good, good
Go nuts, we should, should, should
Got lost in the back of a club, I'm good
Won't stop til I catch that buzz, I'm good

I've been avoiding a call from someone I once knew
Ain't got no parachute breaking my fall
believe it's more fun to
Not give a fuck for a minute at all
yeah I'm looking for some truth
But I'm complacent when facing the wall
know you want me to want you
Never took one of those before, but I'm not nervous
You say I gotta go overboard, well it better be worth it
No smoke what you choking for, the room's all empty
Best off if I close the door, too many things gonna tempt me
You know I'm focused, so I'll never fade away
See I'm hopeless, but I'm hoping that you'll stay
So here's a toast to all the friends I made today
Probably stab me in my back, but it's still too soon to say

No rush, I'm good, good, good
Go nuts, we should, should, should
Fell back and he can't get up, I'm good
Won't stop til I catch that buzz, I'm good
No rush, I'm good, good, good
Go nuts, we should, should, should
Got lost in the back of a club, I'm good
Won't stop til I catch that buzz, I'm good
I don't know if I can face it all
Cause I don't know how I can fake, fake surprise
At how I managed to waste it all
I guess I don't know not to break, to break

No rush, I'm good, good, good
Go nuts, we should, should, should
Fell back and he can't get up, I'm good
Won't stop til I catch that buzz, I'm good
No rush, I'm good, good, good
Go nuts, we should, should, should
Got lost in the back of a club, I'm good
Won't stop til I catch that buzz, I'm good
