WE HATE EVERYONE

Wanted smoked turkey, instead they gave me roasted
Life would be easy if bitches just did what I told em
Bunch of rich kids, white shit up on their noses
Dickhead elected even though I freaking voted
No one Rsvp'd to the party that I hosted
Swimming in a pool of negative emotions
Get too close, I'll sue
Fuck you and your mom too
I hate beagles and sunshine
Losers and anime
Only thing I love is this world is a tragedy
Seven days straight, I'll complain, right
Wanna see me satisfied, better hang tight
I got beef with the Mta, all my relatives are my enemies
Everybody blows regardless of what I do
There's a hair in my Thai food

I hate my job, I hate my dog, I hate it all
I hate my friends, I hate my dad, it's all their fault
Sometimes I even think that I might hate myself
I hate everyone and nobody can help
I, I hate everyone
I, I hate everyone
I, I hate everyone and nobody can help

Crowded in the subway, robbed out my pockets
Od'ed on vitamin C but obviously got sick
Housewives addicted to gossip
A dozen idiots rubbing tits in a mosh pit
Paid all my bills but the water's still toxic
Only thing to do now is sit around and talk shit
Doing awesome, it's all Fubar
Fuck you and your cool car
I hate flowers and airplanes
Nice guys and good deeds
Only thing I love in this world is some good weed
Breathe in and out but I'm angry
My son does drugs, his teachers blame me
Boss won't pay me, government's faithless
Dislike things and I have no basis
Not sorry, how's that?
Dead rat in my mousetrap

I don't want to see beauty, I don't want to see beauty
I hate my job, I hate my dog, I hate it all
I hate my friends, I hate my dad, it's all their fault
Sometimes I even think that I might hate myself
I hate everyone and nobody can help
I, I hate everyone
I, I hate everyone
I, I hate everyone and nobody can help
