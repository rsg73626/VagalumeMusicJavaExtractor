WISHING IT WAS YOU

I've got something on my mind
Like I'm out every night
But all I do is miss you
And you're not even mine
Met your fucking girlfriend
She was looking perfect
Thought that I could change you
Fuck it isn't working

I don't know if I'm the one to blame but
Every time I hear you say my name
I can't move, I can't eat or sleep
I'm doomed, it's not fun for me
Sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you
Yeah I'm sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you

You put both arms around me
Said you're glad you found me
But only as a friend
My broken heart is pounding
Maybe I'm just selfish
But baby I can't help it
Look me in the eyes and say you never felt it

I don't know if I'm the one to blame but
Every time I hear you say my name
I can't move, I can't eat or sleep
I'm doomed, I can't fucking breathe
Sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you
Yeah I'm sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you

I've got room in my apartment, thought that you should know
If you take out the garbage, I'll pay for the phone
I don't need a wedding, let's stay home instead
We can both confess things we've never even said

Sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you
Yeah I'm sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you
Sucking on a bottle of Jim Beam, wishing it was you
