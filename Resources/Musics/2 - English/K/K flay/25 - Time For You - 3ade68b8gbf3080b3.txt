TIME FOR YOU

You got drunk & said you love me
But I wouldn't come inside
I've got options, trust me
Yeah I know other guys
Sometimes you're just so awful
And all my friends agree
But I can't help the way I stumble
You look good when you've been mean
You disappear for weeks at least, you barely have a job
Don't know why it feels like recently I'm choking on exhaust
And you held my head on the train that one night in the cold
Asked me could you stick around
And I fucking told you no, but

I, I, I've got time for you
You, you make me want to die without trying to
Be careful I'm easy to crush
Yeah I'm know I'm busy enough
But I, I, I've got time for you

How could you go chasing after me
And not see that it hurt
When you replayed all your histories
Of lines & ripping shirts
Now you're screaming that you're angry
That you retraced all my steps
Please stop saying that you're changing
Get the fuck out of my bed
Cause I need someone else
who every night remembers I exist
Who doesn't say that he's ready
but then can't ever commit
All I know is that you're bad for me
And I'm like bad enough
Still when I'm alone in some hotel room
You're the one I want, cause

I, I, I've got time for you
You, you make me want to die without trying to
Be careful I'm easy to crush
Yeah I'm know I'm busy enough
But I, I, I've got time for you

Only thing that I can count on is you not coming through
So why do I find myself wishing I was next to you
In a crowd full of people on south 2nd
but I'm still texting you
I'm sick of that, I'm sick of the second you leave
how I invest in you
Well I made plans tonight, but I'm panicked
Feel like canceling, damnit
I hang on your lips like they're a cliff til I slip & vanish
You said in a couple months you might be ready
And part of me's still hoping
But you won't be, and both of us we know it

I, I, I've got time for you
You, you make me want to die without trying to
Be careful I'm easy to crush
Yeah I'm know I'm busy enough
But I, I, I've got time for you
