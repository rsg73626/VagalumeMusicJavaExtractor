CAN'T SLEEP

Maybe I've been slipping back
Heading south,
carsick on a tuesday

Missing cash, blacking out,
heartless in a few ways
Shit for luck, elbows shredded
I held things steady
like too late

Please calm the fuck down,
I'll do whatever you say

I get it, I get it,
I'm living too hard
and it's time that I stop it
But rising on up
and then tumbling down
Well it's part of the process

Bar tabs on a hot night
in a cold basement
You say I'm crazy
But I feel amazing

My mother told me
that the world has got it's plans
I wanna hold them
'til they burn right through my hands

Don't ask me questions cause I'm
tired of confessing
And I know that it's not much to say
But I swear that I'd like to change

I can't sleep,
I hope I stay awake
Cause I've been running, running,
running all day
Long nights, no peace
I feel like everybody's eyes on me
I can't sleep

Maybe I've been freaking out
Moving quick, burning the wick
at both ends

Screaming loud, stupid shit,
scaring all of my old friends
Fell down on Bedford,
hope that it's not broken
Safe to say I might have had
Too much of some of these potions

I love you so much,
I'm staying here all night
Don't want to get up, I don't want to stop
I don't want to close my eyes

I'd rather not give a fuck
And end up with some scars
The night's just long enough for me
to build it all and let it fall apart

My mother told me
that the world has got it's plans
I wanna hold them
'til they burn right through my hands

Don't ask me questions cause I'm
tired of confessing
And I know that it's not much to say
But I swear that I'd like to change

I can't sleep,
I hope I stay awake
Cause I've been running, running,
running all day
Long nights, no peace
I feel like everybody's eyes on me
I can't sleep
