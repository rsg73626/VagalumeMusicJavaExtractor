THICKER THAN DUST

Me and my friends, thicker than blood
Just trying to breathe something thicker than dust
I need to keep my mind, my mind moving on up
Because it's always rolling down, always rolling down

I'm in a brand new time zone
we got a whole new state of mind
Buzzing all high on a tight rope, eyes lit up
like the Vegas sign
Nobody around got a husband
nobody around got a wife to call
Thinking about when I felt lovesick
doesn't really sound like a life at all
I'm in the mood for a plot twist
never cared what I'm supposed to be
Fuck living life in an office, my eyes, no not focusing
Wishing my future would carve out
bank notes and dinner plans
But we look better with the stars out
waking up to go to sleep again

Me and my friends, thicker than blood
Just trying to breathe something, thicker than dust
I need to keep my mind, my mind moving on up
Because it's always rolling down, always rolling down

I've got a brand new passion
we found a whole new way to see
Might spend a whole night smashing
wait for the blowback patiently
World never seemed like a fair place
bad people got the nicest things
Same shit playing on the airwaves
naked girls, diamond rings
All my life been a good kid, so what I got a broken car

Moved my shit out of Brooklyn, laughed out loud, fell apart
Money's overrated, sex ain't hard to find
We're not in love, since when is that a crime
Me and my friends, thicker than blood
Just trying to breathe something, thicker than dust
I need to keep my mind, my mind moving on up
Because it's always rolling down, always rolling down

I thank God, feeling warmer, getting closer
All we've got, push it further, almost over
One last sip, kiss me like you really mean it
Times like this, I want something to believe in
Me and my friends, thicker than blood
Just trying to breathe something, thicker than dust
I need to keep my mind, my mind moving on up
Because it's always rolling down, always rolling down
