GET IT RIGHT

Gotta get it right, gotta get it right
To make today mine
I wanna be the best
I wanna wake up feeling like I fucking slept
I wanna prove you wrong, that my story isn't written
I wanna be something gold, I wanna be someone different
Wanna turn back the clock, tell my father to be stronger

Cause he missed me growing up
And I want to tell the little girl in the corner of that room
Don't lose hope, just be brave, things get better soon
I wanna fall in love
I wanna crash and burn but learn to rise above
And I don't care about success
I just wanna make you proud
I wanna be the kind of person
who shows up and sticks around

I wanna stay sincere, but that kind of thing is tricky
When you give up all yourself and still the end result is iffy
Like nothing I've created even matters
So now I wanna do stupid shit
I wanna get fucking plastered
Want to get out my brain, want to shed my skin
I need to find someone to tuck me in
Want you to know that I wanna be better
But it feels like it's gonna take forever

Gotta get it right, gotta get it right
To make today mine
I wanna do it all
I wanna stand up straight but have the strength to fall
I wanna tell my cousin to stop treating people bad
I know you think that no one sees
but I've been keeping tabs
I wanna be consoled
I want the world to change, I wanna die when I'm old

And I don't wanna make mistakes
that I've been watching all my life
It's easy to do because, I want to be good despite
I wanna go somewhere else, I wanna get super high
Tell you to go fuck yourself, cause shit I'm doing fine
I wanna go break the chain of what I'm supposed to be
I wanna locate my faith, drop down on both my knees

And honestly, I wanna ask if you'd stay
For a night, for a week, or just a day
Always moving too late, shit I've been regretting
I wanna throw my phone, I wanna quit confessing
I wanna cast the blame, but nobody's at fault
Confusion got me building these walls
Want you to know that I wanna be better
But it feels like it's going to take forever
Gotta get it right, gotta get it right
To make today mine
