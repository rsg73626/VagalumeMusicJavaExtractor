LESS THAN ZERO

Brain dead, hit the snooze
No job, what's the use
Last night, pass the joint
Still life yeah that's the point
Get dressed, half awake
Ripped jeans and a stomachache
Try to puke but it won't come out
Think of all the shit I wish I'd known about

Kneel down, fade to black
Two fingers stick 'em back
Want food but I burned the toast
Little things always the first to go
Phone rings, don't care
Dead space, blank stare
Left and right inside my mind neither here nor there
Less than zero greater than the sum of my parts
Want to light a fire but I can't get a spark
Stop, stop, stop making me live like this

Both shoes filled with lead
Somehow rise off the bed
Head pounding, kill the lights
Scared to death I'll never feel alright
Ten paces more like miles
Lips cracked, fake a smile
Swear that I'll stop swimming in my afterthoughts
But it's nothing new
Too much shit I can't undo

And no matter what you say I know I've disappointed you
Get these demons off of me
Ask the man can I have a coffee please
Faded for hell of it, just a table of elements I am
Less than zero greater than the sum of my parts
Want to light a fire but I can't get a spark
Stop, stop, stop making me live like this

Before I know it, the day's already over
And I'm ready to go at it again
I wanna feel no thing is even real so
Drift into oblivion
