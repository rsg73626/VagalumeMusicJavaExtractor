NO

She's been hurt before but don't mind it much
Met a guy at a bar last night with a minor buzz
Said he liked it rough
So she got undressed dimmed the lights just a touch
Shut her eyes to fantasize for a second yeah
It felt like love
It's just that only when the moment's passed
Does the shit sink in
Bent back on a different mattress without thinking
Too young to be moving backwards, got years to go
See you can ask her
But she can't say no, she can't say no

He's been wrong before, but it feels so great
Met a girl in the neighborhood, he
Said name a place, she said fuck a date
After it happened, he wanna talk
But she wanna leave his place
And just walk away, he's screaming wait
For a second yeah it seemed ok
It's just that only when the moment's passed
Does shit hit the fan
Left cold on a different mattress, without a plan
Too young to be moving backwards, got years to go
See you can ask him
But he can't say no, he can't say no

Get a call 3am, guess who's on the line
It's gonna be you saying sorry but you gotta talk now
Cause you really fucked up this time
Cry out that you need my help
That you're breaking down, that you hate yourself
And you felt this great big emptiness
So you messed around, now it hurts like hell
Meanwhile I'm thinking you're weak
I'm seeing the cracks in the logic

Realize I resent every time we speak
Which is all too often
And I know that your dad was absent
And your mom sat back
Let it happen
So you spend like half of your life on your knees
And you're looking to me for a little compassion
All these excuses, they never stop
Say you're confused and I'm all you got
I know you use me, I know it's wrong
But when you ask me just to talk
