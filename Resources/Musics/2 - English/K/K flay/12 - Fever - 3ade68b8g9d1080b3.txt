FEVER

I doubt that this is love
But I don't got enough of it
A fever when it comes
A fever when it doesn't hit
I got a couple hundred dollars, but nobody to call
I got a couple hundred dollars, but nobody to call

Blacked out, lit up, no sleep in my system
Misspelled my own name, passwords well I guessed em
Maxims, well I test em, bedroom just closing in
Yesterday's too distant, write it down so I don't forget
I said I-I I've got some missed calls, oversights
Messages that I'll never get, pitfalls of a broken life

Texted him, no supply, waiting on shit to level off
Swear if I spill it I'll make sure to save it up
Off the carpet I plan to be taking off
Indigo shades, windows all tinted
It's just a phase that maybe I'll finish
Went from minimum wage to maybe no limit
I'm just afraid that my cynical ways might mean
That I won't be ending the sentence

I doubt that this is love
But I don't got enough of it
A fever when it comes
A fever when it doesn't hit
I doubt that this is love
Feeling more like suffering
Cause even when it comes
And even when it doesn't hit
I got a couple hundred dollars, but nobody to call
I got a couple hundred dollars, but nobody to call
Guess I'll be blowing it all

White teeth, real gold, head spinning like real slow
Wake me up at 10, 20s in my billfold
Got me with that steel toe
should have known there's a price to pay
Might be why I feel so fucked up like any time of day
I mean I-I I've got some deadlines, concerns
Asking me about how I've been, said fine but I'm unsure
Next line on the curb, you could say that that's desperate

But panic been seizing my chest
I've been pressed to the ceiling, I'm needing a sedative
Spinning in place, wanting a respite
Point that I break, not gonna respect it
Yeah I'm in la, but my mind is in texas
Like fuck it but what can I say
when nothing remains out of the question

I doubt that this is love
But I don't got enough of it
A fever when it comes
A fever when it doesn't hit
I got a couple hundred dollars, but nobody to call, call
I got a couple hundred dollars, but nobody to call
Guess I'll be blowing it all
Blowing it all
