BLOOD IN THE CUT

The boy I love's got another girl
He might be fucking her right now
I don't have an apartment
Thought if I was smart I'd make it far
But I'm still at the start

Guess I'm contagious
It'd be safest if you ran
Fuck that's what they all just
end up doing in the end
Take my car and paint it black
Take my arm, break it in half
Say something, do it soon
It's too quiet in this room

I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut

I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
Need some blood in the cut
I need blood in the cut

Met back up with the boy I love
Cried on the streets of San Francisco
I don't have an agenda
All I do is pretend to be ok
so my friends can't see
my heart in the blender

Lately, I've been killing all my time
Reading through your messages
My favorite way to die

Take my head and kick it in
Break some bread
for all my sins
Say a word, do it soon
It's too quiet in this room

I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut

I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
Need some blood in the cut
I need blood in the cut
