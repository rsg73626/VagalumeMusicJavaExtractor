EVERYONE I KNOW

Everyone I know, everyone I know is sad
Smiling in a bad way, high off stolen meds
Everyone I know, everyone I know's got plans
But they all just play the keys in shitty bands
Call my phone if you're feeling lonely
Cause I'm not anyone's one and only
I'm dead, I'm dead

Everyone I know, everyone I know is mean
Mad they're 25 not 17
Everyone I know, everyone I know's a kid
Who'll turn out like their fucked up brother did
Write me back if you're feeling empty
I like the rules, I don't like pretending I'm bad
Cause I'm not bad, cause I'm not bad

Everyone I know, everyone I know is great
Good enough to fight for second place
Everyone I know, everyone I know can talk
Until their lives get outlined in chalk
Come around if you're feeling frightened
I can see that the noose is tightening fast
Way too fast, way too fast
The city's gonna kill me, throw me
From a building, shoot me in a drive by
The city's gonna stalk me, knock out
All my front teeth, drown me in the high tide
