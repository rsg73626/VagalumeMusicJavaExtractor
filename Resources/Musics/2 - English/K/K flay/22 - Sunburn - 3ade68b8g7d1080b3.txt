SUNBURN

Feeling like I might might drift drift off
into a new dimension
Jack in the motherfucking box
I got quarter pounder distention
Too many made up characters vying for my attention
I'm cold and I'm lonely, just floating toward the light
Think that I might get a kick out of life
if life was more like a sitcom

Lies I've been fed by some bitch exec
boy that's what I bit on
So tired, all I wanna do's just find something to sit on
Don't tell me I'm melting please help me
unh uh wait a minute
So so soporific I'm in the midst of apathy, see
Sensing next to nothing but that's the point exactly
Suppose I better do what my toes have asked of me
People waving, blind to what I'm facing

Watch as I spin these blades
Let my mind just fly
Sun burning on my face
Time to say goodbye
So much I'll never know
No, I don't want an answer, answer
If you need to be questioning me
I'm separate see, so you can ask her

It takes a dozen hits just to numb out half my pain
My father looks down on me
and says what a crying shame
Incompetently navigating treacherous terrain
Sleep or stay awake well it's really all the same
Popping a handful of xanax just to just to just to manage
Filling my head with feelies
til my brain it turns to cabbage
Mapping up out my fate with a random collection
of mad libs

Aiming for slightly below average
Sinking slowly, getting sleepy
Living mostly cause it's easy
Sticking closely to the line
Looking happy, feeling breezy
Walking past now do you see me
It's getting better all the time

Watch as I spin these blades
Let my mind just fly
Sun burning on my face
Time to say goodbye
So much I'll never know
No, I don't want an answer, answer
If you need to be questioning me
I'm separate see, so you can ask her

Wasting everything, all my vigor and my youth
Diluting the confusion I am choosing what is truth
I've got no use for future plans
used to care but now I don't
Do almost anything I can to hide the fact I'll die alone
Not worried about my taxes, not giving a flying fuck
Not worried about my ashes
that one day will turn to dust
Not thinking that I should listen
just wanna be feeling great
Doesn't matter what's the prison
rest assured I will escape
