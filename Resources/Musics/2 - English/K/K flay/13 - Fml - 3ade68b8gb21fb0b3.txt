FML

I need to stop
I been doing too much
I been running too fast
I been testing my luck

I been living cloud nine
I been at it all night
I been feeling so loved

I been waking up lit
I been making up shit
I been spilling my guts

I been feeling so blessed
But stressed all day
So what?

I'm living out my dreams
Like every night
I love my life
But when I open up my blurry eyes
It's not as nice

Fuck my life
I love my life
Fuck my life
I love my life
Fuck my life

I need to chill
I been getting my ill
I been spreading that text
I been spinning my wheels

I been having mai ties
I been loving bad guys
I been seeking some thrills

I been wanting one more
Then I wanted like four
I been having some guilt

I been feeling so blessed
But stressed all day
For real

I'm living out my dreams
Like every night
I love my life
But when I open up my blurry eyes
It's not as nice

Fuck my life
I love my life
Fuck my life
I love my life

Babe, I don't know what to say
This is the way that I like it
And I can't be bothered to attempt to change
In no way

Babe, if you know what I mean
Low in my body, go darken by dark
Like it just went somewhere in between
It's so sweet

But fuck my life
I love my life
Fuck my life
I love my life

Fuck my life
I love my life
Fuck my life
I love my life
Fuck my life
