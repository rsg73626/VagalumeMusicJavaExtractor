FROM YOUR BREED

There is a thing you missed to give:
A guiding line to follow.
Build me walls that are not hollow,
Tell me not how I should live.

I feel like I was born alone
In a house that was no home,
In storms of stench, a wasteland,
You did never hold my hand.

Revenge is lusting in your heart,
Hate becomes your silent guard,
You reach a point of no return,
And freedom you will learn!
You will learn to fly, not to cry,
Born to rule, not as a fool.
I am a beast from your breed!
The day will come, I take the lead!
Inner beast, break free,
And death will be.
I am a beast from your breed!
The day will come, I take the lead!
I missed the warm and saving hands
And so I missed every chance
To escape from this hell.
This is my farewell!

In a life shattered like mine,
In a house cruel like thine,
I am a beast from your breed!
The day will come, I take the lead!
I see it's not too late.
While you try to watch me die
I will try to fly away
With blood, to change my fate!
Learn to fly, not to cry,
Born to rule, not as a fool.
I am a beast from your breed!
The day will come, I take the lead!
Inner beast, break free,
And death will be.
I am a beast from your breed!
The day will come, I take the lead!
