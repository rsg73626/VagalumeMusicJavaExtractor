THE VOICE BESIDE

I'm with him, he's the evil inside
I've lost you, but it was not me!

In my mind I'm not alone
There is someone with me
Strangest faces he has shown
Will he ever set me free?
It's wasting all I ever had
This voice beside my own
I wish I cried and showed regret
But he is me and I'm alone!

Feeling so strange, thoughts have gone wild
Feeling so weird, someone else is guiding me!
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
I kill you, my voice inside
Yes, I'll shoot myself!
Someone else is guiding me!
You won't break me!
You won't break me!
You won't break me!
I will break you!
You won't break me!
I will break you!
I kill you, my voice inside
Yes, I'll shoot ourselves!

In my mind I'm not alone
There is someone with me
Strangest faces he has shown
Will he ever set me free?
It's wasting all I ever had
This voice beside my own
I wish I cried and showed regret
But he is me and I'm alone!
