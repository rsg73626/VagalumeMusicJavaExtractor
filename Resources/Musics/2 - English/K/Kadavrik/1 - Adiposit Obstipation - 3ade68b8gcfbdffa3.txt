ADIPOSIT OBSTIPATION

He's a taker not a giver
Seven plagues will make all shiver
Locusts eat his own uncreation

Scum feeds him
They must unite
They should get a giant fire burning
With flames up into heaven
Teaching him the pain he brings to all of them

His forceful hand is hidden by crusts of blood
Spread a disease!
The ideas and ideals of mankind
Just a failed mutation of the apekind
To feed their god's adiposit stomach
Obstipation until his body bursts
They cannot see nothing is given back
Kept inside him to rot for nothing

If they don't love him he will darken their sky
Pretends he bled for them and wants his bill paid
Tries to obstipate instead of giving back
He keeps it in while for a miracle they wait
And if they don't love him he will darken their sky
Pretends he bled for them and wants his bill paid
He is fed up by his own uncreation
Adiposit obstipation

Scum feeds him
They must unite
They should get a giant fire burning
With flames up into heaven
Teaching him the pain he brings to others

His justice is no chance, just a promise of relieve
Obstipated to the max, begging for release

Merciless and ravenous
From consuming their obedience
Why don't you sacrifice a sip of spit
And a hammer blow right to the cross?
Or just don't waste any of your strength
You can make it the whole length
Without caring 'bout this man in the clouds
Eating to excess
'till the clouds can't carry him no more

If they don't love him he will darken their sky
Pretends he bled for them and wants his bill paid
Tries to obstipate instead of giving back
He keeps it in while for a miracle they wait
And if they don't love him he will darken their sky
Pretends he bled for them and wants his bill paid
He is fed up by his own uncreation
Adiposit obstipation

Scum feeds him
They must unite
They should get a giant fire burning
With flames up into heaven
Teaching him the pain he brings to them

And because he won't love them they will darken his sky
Because they bled for him and want their bill paid
They're fed up by their own uncreation
Adiposit obstipation
