LET MY BLOOD BOIL TONIGHT

Access to excess is never denied
Taking it to my inside
Light the joy within my blood
We're all burning for the beauty of the night

Everyone I'm talking to
Turns to ashes from the sparks I spit
I am the last one standing in this room
In fields of ashes I'm in bloom

Let my blood boil tonight
Knocks me down but I step up
To rule the world that I now own
The tiny moon is fearing me
Command the winds just as I walk
As I am on my way home

I am god, I want to create!

Reaching for the rooftop
Finally I'm there
Home is where the stars are
My home is in the sky
With a noise I'm waking up to fall asleep
Sleepwalking towards white
Never ever take me back from where I went
A journey to the end

Let my blood boil tonight
Knocks me down but I step up
To rule the world that I now own
The tiny moon is fearing me
Command the winds just as I walk
As I am on my way home

Let my blood boil tonight
Knocks me down but I step up
To rule the world that I now own
The tiny moon is fearing me
Command the winds just as I walk
As I am on my way home
