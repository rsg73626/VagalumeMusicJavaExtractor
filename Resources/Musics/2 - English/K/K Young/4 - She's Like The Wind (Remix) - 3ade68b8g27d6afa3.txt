*Rapping by snoop dogg*

K.young:
You’ve been saying that you ready to settle down
Well baby girl I’m loving the way that sounds
I don’t wanna be a player no more
I’ve done it all before and now

I think I am ready for something a little more
All I ever needed is you
I don’t wanna go away
I need you more everyday, yeah
Cause all I ever needed is you

Chorus:
Gotta keep it real
The way she makes me feel
I need her again
She’s like the wind
I worry bout her
Whenever I call
My lover, my friend
She’s like the wind

Snoop dogg:
Gonna rock with us
Vibekingz gonna rock with ya x2

K. young:
I can vision us growing old together
I know I love these hoes but I can love you forever
If you give me a chance I don have your life
Just say the words, I’ll upgrade you twice

I think I am ready for something a little more
All I ever needed is you
I don’t wanna go away
I need you more everyday, yeah
Cause all I ever needed is you

Chorus:
Gotta keep it real
The way she makes me feel
I need her again
She’s like the wind
I worry bout her
Whenever I call
My lover, my friend
She’s like the wind
Can I catch ya, breezy
She’s nice and easy
She knows how to please me
Only you x2
