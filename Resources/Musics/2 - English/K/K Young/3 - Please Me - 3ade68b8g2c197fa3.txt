You're my undercover lover
Nobody knows what we do
We got to keep this sound on the down low
Because baby if they knew about us
It would probably crowd around us
With our business in the streets
Let's keep this between me and you

She got class a big oh-ass
I loose my mind everytime she walks pass
My boys talk trash
They be saying I be stenten
But all around the world they know
I'm big pimping
It's really nothing
But I'm feeling your style
Behind closed doors
I be doing her wild
I don't rap but I sing
But I'm doing my thing
K-young and vibekings
Baby holla at cha boy

Did you know, I produced this track
I get major respect from American acts
I go to california
And in ma made back

Plus I'm bring shah back
It's the boss move(what)
Because the bosses here
I'm taking over now
Because the bosses here
I'm flossin
Like my name is Mike Jones
From Paris to Rome,
But Here is home

Your my new only super freak
I know, you know

Your idea is so unique
Yes the way I like my freak
You know what to do
