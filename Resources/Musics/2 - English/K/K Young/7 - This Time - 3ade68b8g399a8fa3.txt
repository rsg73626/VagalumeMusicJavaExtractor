THIS TIME

Somtimes I cry about us
Nobody really knows
The way I feel
I can't survive without you
How do I make you 
understand that I'm for real

I know I made some
Mistakes in the past 
Girl I really don't deserve
Another chance, but 
Baby please don`t turn
Away so fast 
Won't you let me show
You that I'm a better man 

(Chorus) 

Girl I promise this time
I'll be honest this time
Imma make you mine
Imm make you mine

If you stick with me
Soon you will see
I am all that you need
And that's all I wanna be 

If you wanna ride
With me baby
Come and roll with 
Me baby
Take the wheel now
Tell me how you 
Feel now

Girl I promise this time
I'll be honest this time
Imma make you mine
Imm make you mine, all mine

Girl I promise this time (3x)
I don't wanna hurt you
Girl I promise this time (3x)
I don't wanna hurt you
anymore

I know I broke your heart girl
I'll do anything to have
You back in my world
I'll prove that I am ready
I'll pass your class,
Come test me 

I will be here for you
Till the end
And I never wanna see
You hurt again, baby
You're my lover and
Very best friend
And it all depends 
On you

(Chorus) 

Girl I promise this time
I'll be honest this time
Imma make you mine
Imma make you mine

If you stick with me
Soon you will see
I am all that you need
Snd that's all I wanna be 

If you wanna ride
With me baby
Come and roll with me baby
Take the wheel now
Tell me how you 
Feel now

Girl I promise this time
I'll be honest this time
Imma make you mine
Imm make you mine, all mine

Girl I promise this time (3x)
I don't wanna hurt you
Girl I promise this time (3x)
I don't wanna hurt you
Anymore

(Chorus)
