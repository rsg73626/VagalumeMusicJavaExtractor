LAY YOU DOWN

[Intro]
Damn
You know you do it big right
OO woo woo

I know exactly what you got in those jeans
And I know what it feels like, so don't you be mean
Don't be a stranger girl its only me, oh
Tonight lets spend some time don't wanna be lonely

Baby kick your shoes off and relax
We ain't in a rush so just kick back (kick back)
All I need is your attention for what I'm needing, ooh
Don't hold your feelings just let go (don't hold your feelings)
But not because I just said so
I've done my part so let me know what your needing

Let me lay you down
Tell me how does it sound to ya
When you turn around
Girl you know I am proud of ya
Wanna freak you, oh I need you
Let me lay you down, wanna lay you down

Don't worry baby girl no I won't leave
Just lay your head down, you can be at ease
No I won't pressure you, but I will plead for it
I've had a taste or two, but I need more of it girl

Baby kick your shoes off and relax
We ain't in a rush so just kick back (kick back)
All I need is your attention for what I'm needing, ooh
Don't hold your feelings just let go (don't hold your feelings)
But not because I just said so
I've done my part so let me know what your needing

Let me lay you down
Tell me how does it sound to ya
When you turn around
Girl you know I am proud of ya
Wanna freak you, oh I need you
Let me lay you down, wanna lay you down

Wanna feel your beat, your heart in my hands, yes I do
Oh its true, that me and you
I'm man I can't stand not havin' you when I know what you've got
And I choose you, so baby come through

[x2]
Let me lay you down
Tell me how does it sound to ya
When you turn around
Girl you know I am proud of ya
Wanna freak you, oh I need you
Let me lay you down, wanna lay you down
