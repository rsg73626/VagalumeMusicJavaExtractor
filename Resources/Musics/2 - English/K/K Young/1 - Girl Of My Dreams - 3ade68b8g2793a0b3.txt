GIRL OF MY DREAMS

It's the simple things
It's the simple things yeah
That turn me on
You know just what to do
It's the dimples in ur smile
I'm addicted to ur style
You got what it takes to drive me wild

When dance just keep dancing this dance on me
I love when you put your hands on me
[x2]

Girl I'll be the one you need
Ur the girl of my dreams
Ooh baby
I love the way you had me daydreaming of you
I'm feeling for you
Ur the girl of my dreams

Girl ur bringin' sexy back
How can I be down with that
When u turn around ur so amazing
Girl my diddy is on fire
Come fulfill my desires
I just wanna try ur goods if it's cool with you

When dance just keep dancing this dance on me
I love when you put your hands on me
[x2]

Girl I'll be the one you need
Ur the girl of my dreams
Ooh baby
I love the way you had me daydreaming of you
I'm feeling for you
Ur the girl of my dreams
