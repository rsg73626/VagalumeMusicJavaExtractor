WHAT YOU WAITIN' FOR

[Verse 1:]
On the Block I'm In My Zone,
I call you up but you're Not At Home
I Can't Wait To See You Later on a Scene
And We Can Get Deep In too
None of us alone, nothing we do is wrong,

[Hook 1:]
I just wanna walk with you, talk with you
Better care not, sparks with you
Anything you wanna do
Said it always, it's All for You
Wanna get to know ya,
Think of places I can show ya
All the things you've ever seen in your dreams

[Hook 2:]
Let me know what the deal,
We can roll we can chill,
Ride at 5, if you're tired
We can vibe, all night
Tell you you're mine, you tell me yours
If we get bored, you lock the door
I don't need, none of my people they all can leave.

[Chorus:]
Now it's you and me, and me and you
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love, and all the times
So Happy Together

If I should call you up, invest a dime,
And you say you'll be home with me and ease my mind,
Imagine how the world would be, so very fine,
So Happy Together

[Hook 1:]
I Just wanna walk with you, talk with you
Better care spark with you
Anything you wanna do
Said it only it's All For You
Wanna get to know ya,
Think of places I can show ya
All the things you've ever seen in your dreams


(Hook 2)
Let me know what the deal,
We can roll we can chill,
Ride at 5, if you're tired
We can vibe, all night
Tell you you're mine, you tell me yours
If we get bored, you lock the door
I don't need none of my people they all can leave.

[Verse 2:]
It so many places I'd like to show ya
Take you trips out across the globe
Paris dinners have Romantic dinners
Keep room for desert when the food is finished
Time to break you off, like the roots in music
Pick you which chick that I choose to move with
So if you would tell me who you crew with
I tell you who you are
If they can rap if whether you just with me for the car
If the day when a man drives
Is what drives a man and for it the man dies
For the things he believes in,
If so when he dies it'll assume the he's leaving
Believe me I'm keeping you satisfied
Put the drama aside and just ride,
We could do the darkest weather
Get rich, stacking the cheddar who would keep the blunt licked,
Give me respect and I bet we'll be happy together

[Hook 2:]
Let me know what the deal,
We can roll we can chill,
Ride at 5, if you're tired
We can vibe, all night
Tell you you're mine, you tell me yours
If we get bored, you lock the door
I don't need none of my people they all can leave.

[Chorus:]
Now it's you and me, and me and you
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love, and all the times
So Happy Together
