YOU'RE SO BAD

[verse 1: K Young]
Hey shorty u've got skills

Push the 6 I push the range
Iced out watch n pinky ring (whooaa)

Baby girl come roll wit me

Let ur body all over me
Get loose take a lil dose of me

[verse 3: Crooked I]
I'm soo bad it hurts my heart
Good job god shes a work of art
I observe ur mini skirt swirvin part
My flirt game go to work thats a perfect start
Yeah me n u could do a couple of thingz
Money wit no quarter piece wat does it mean
Are u beyonces cousin
Ashanti's auntie
A body like that got'em ready in jeans
Girl just step in my lil office
We skatin on 28's we real bosses
My whip sits so high she feel nauxious
The desert e on dech I'm still cautious
I thought I told ya hop out the rover
These side chicks love a long beach solja
Even these highness offerin me branoja
Keep the se la ropa its over

[chorus: K Young]
Baby youre soo bad
N thats wat I like
I wanna get u home tonight
N give u all I have
Girl the way u movin
U kno ima get u right
Baby ur soo bad
The way u workin me
Tryna act all hard to get (uh ohhh)
Girl ur so scandulous
But I kno I can handle it
Baby ur sooo bad
