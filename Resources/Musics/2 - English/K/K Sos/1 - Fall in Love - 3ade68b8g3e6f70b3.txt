FALL IN LOVE

We were made to fall in love
You gotta know that nothings gonna last forever
Won't forget the times you were my best friend
All I know is we were meant to fall in love
We were meant to fall in love
Ya gotta know that nothings gonna last forever

Won't forget the times you were my best friend
All I know is were meant to fall in love
We were made to fall in love
Sometimes I can't believe we're not together
What am I to do without my best friend
All I know is we were meant to fall in love

Ok, ok things they change all the time
Somehow we can't combine
And its true if I just had you everything be fine
Can't get you off my mind
You're the whole reason I wrote this rhyme
Do anything just to get you back
But girl you know I'm a rolling stone
Far from home gotta paint it black
Got me guessing where ya at?

If your somewhere sipping drinks
Wondering if you've heard the record
Songs bout you girl what you think
You don't have to say a thing
I know that I missed your call
I been writing three straight days
A pencil beat and these four walls
Many problems still unsolved
Many problems still approach

Gotta keep my focus here or it might all go up in smoke
Know I gotta show em dear that noc is not no joke
Its all he ever hoped for
Its what he's always wanted most come in close
We were made to fall in love
You gotta know that nothings gonna last forever
Won't forget the times you were my best friend
All I know is we were meant to fall in love

And the stars dear are out tonight
Don't you see that
That the moon glows like a spotlight
Right on me
But I'm never gonna change my ways
So on a cloud is where I will be
Til its time for them to take me away
Or you come and set me free
Set me free

Light the flame its getting dark
Can't believe you stole my heart
Your so perfect, aren't I worth it
I can't stand when we're apart
Loving yous my favorite art
There's no end if we restart
I been through a lot of things
But life without you its so hard
You say drop the summer jobs
You know that I gotta stay

Allows me time to rock the crowds
Record the flows and get this pay
I paid my dues to pave my way
Worth it all the leaders say
We'll suffer through the trouble times
And bask in all our glory days
Tell me that its all ok

Tell me I have half a chance
What you gonna do with him
Girl he don't even like to dance
Let me show you what he can't
Let me show you want I know
Cuz we were meant to fall in love I know it cuz you told me so

We were meant to fall in love
Gotta know that nothings gonna last forever
I won't forget the times you were my best friend
All I know is we were meant to fall in love
We were meant to fall in love
Sometimes I can't believe we're not together
What am I to do without my best friend
All I know is we were made to fall in love
Playing to the stars above

Come and be with me through stormy weather
Times I spent with you some of my best and
All I know is we were meant to fall in love
I can't live without your love
Can't you see that we were meant to be together
What am I to do without my best friend
All I know is we were made to fall in love
