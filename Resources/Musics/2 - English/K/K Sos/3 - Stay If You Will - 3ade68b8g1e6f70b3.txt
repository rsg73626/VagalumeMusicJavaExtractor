STAY IF YOU WILL

She likes dancing to my music
But she doesn't know nothing about me
Doesn't know I plan to leave here
But I'll stay if you will, stay if you will
Its supposed to rain tomorrow
And yesterday was so cloudy
After tonight I gotta leave here
But I'll stay if you will
Stay if you will

Knows a thing or two bout romance
Little bit of everything
Boredom led her to seduce some
But very few have seen her wings
Cuz she doesn't want to be in love
I can tell cuz her pain shows
So I'm slowly walking over now
Whatever happens beats being alone

On the verge of yawning
Can I save the moment
Is she starting to think its getting late
I just said hello now, and I still don't know now
What it is that I am gonna say
I don't want her name yet, I want to remember
But I'm lost in her face, lost in face
She says she bout to leave and I know I gotta convince her to stay
I gotta convince her to stay

They always hit her with corny lines
I sip vodka and seven from the corner
Eyes on her know her tag says made in heaven
And I'm hoping that she saw me
But I definitely can't be certain
So I chose to make a move across the room to meet this person
Energy attracts me, legs that go for miles

We're still pretty far away but the girl has got such a smile
Then I bumped into my boy saying sos how you been
Come with me a sec I gotta introduce you to some friends
So we jet over to the bar stand two tall pretty blondes
One I think I saw with rams and the other likes my songs
So I say nice to meet ya I have to move along

Cuz the one I have to meet at any second could be gone
And its on, scan the room pray the moment isn't over
Did I lose my chance did some banker dude approach her
Then I looked over my shoulder and we're almost back to back
As she steps up to the bar with an almost empty glass

On the verge of yawning
Can I save the moment
Is she starting to think its getting late
I just said hello now, and I still don't know now
What it is that I am gonna say
I don't want her name yet, I want to remember
But I'm lost in her face, lost in face
She says she bout to leave and I know I gotta convince her to stay
I gotta convince her to stay
