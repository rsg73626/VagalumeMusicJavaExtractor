RELIEF

We drink away the night
And deal with it in the morning
Now my head is pounding
And I'm off to work again
I'm trying to get it right
But I can't help exploring
When its getting boring
And there's no relief in sight

We drink away the night
And deal with it in the morning
Some nights I'm reborn and some don't wet my appetite
I'm trying to live this life
For things that are important
But I can't exploring
While I'm trying to get it right

Another confession so dear diary
Call into work again and pray that they don't fire me
I should of known better, showered but could barely stand
Head for the toilet cuz I think I might throw up again
I'm trying to be the man on edge where its risky
Mixing tequila in while sipping on the whisky
A hangover morning bowls couldn't even cure
I keep swearing I'ma stop like I'm really sure
Another year passes, life flashes by tread slow long path
I did it all for the blondes and the bomb ass
Nah it was all for my moms if they gone ask
Why if I knew I had to work would I wake up smashed, shit
And spent all my cash, found my keys in the grass
Pizza crust in the trash sometimes lust for the past
Know futures much brighter learning life is the reason why I'm spitting such fire
Let me take you higher

We drink away the night
And deal with it in the morning
Some nights I'm reborn and some don't wet my appetite
I'm trying to live this life
For things that are important
But I can't exploring
While I'm trying to get it right

And lonely hearts clubs always got him stressed out
Back in the lab always trying to put his best out
Small rooms got his head all in a smoke cloud
Turns it up cuz he likes his music too loud, loud
And he's too cool to waste it, born in the flood baby she was his favorite
Times when I'm close I ain't too cool to taste it
Look into my eyes and you'll see we gone make it
Check the different flavors, No Ordinary Cats, four born creators
Post doggystyle like snoop dropping vapors
I'ma cross em all of the list for the paper what did ya'll wager
Baby we major, can't win if you don't play
And I'll be back for the world in a few days
So put your hands up top while the nights young
And do your thing it will bring you the right one, light one

We drink away the night
And deal with it in the morning
Some nights I'm reborn and some don't wet my appetite
I'm trying to live this life
For things that are important
But I can't exploring
While I'm trying to get it right

Tell me, tell me will they ever take me as I am
To most of my closest friends I'm one of your biggest fans
And you not being here was never part of the plan
So I hope they just respect it cuz they'll never understand
Damn, I'm a lone desperado, puff puff pass then pass me the bottle
They can't slow down you could call it full throttle
Still so much to say still feeling so hollow
Cali shores dreamin', high expectations
Sits in his bedroom with plans for the nation
Must get that bread soon, he's so sick of waiting
But good things all take time one of the few he has faith in
Pure dedication, dressed the occasion, he pops another pill when he lacks the motivation
Iron clad skill that's real innovation, he feels it coming soon have patience

And I don't want to be the last one
Chilling with my light on
Really thought I had this
Not sure where I went wrong
And its definitely not the first time
And it won't be the last
I'll see you when I see you
Don't you know you're the reason why I get so smashed
