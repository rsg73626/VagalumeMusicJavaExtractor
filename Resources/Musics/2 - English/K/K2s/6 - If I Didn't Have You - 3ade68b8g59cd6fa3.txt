IF I DIDN'T HAVE YOU

CHORUS:
I Don't even know what I'd do If I didn't have you
I need you in my life
I don't even know where I'd go without you in my soul
I need you in my life

At times I felt so all alone
Broken in pieces lost was my soul
I turned my life away from you
was empty inside my mind confused
my heart was aching unto you I cried
healing my pain you said for you I died
because of what you have done in me
Lord now I know your all that I need

KaBuc verse:
Now who was like the Lord in all the universe
I love him so much but he loved me first
I long for his touch he means so much to me
He's worthy of power, praise and all glory
Lift holy hands with me and worship him
The prince of peace, rose of Sharon
Mighty God eternal praises on my lips
Thy loving kindness my mind can't comprehend it
Why draw close to arech like me
When I was your enemy you were pierced for me willingly
That's mind blowing
You're an awesome and perfect God all knowing
You're my savior friend comforter and Lord
My heart, my mind, my will is yours
Holy, holy, I love you my heart just yearns
To look into your lovely face when you return

Smooth verse :
There aint enough words to express how I feel
All this joy and happiness Love completely real
A new man is what I am because of you
You took my old ways away and made me brand new
Showing Love when no one else did made me see
How much you cared for a sinful man like me
You've been waiting all along with open arms
Made my troubles gone you shielded me from harm
You were my father when he wasn't there
And when I didn't care you made me care
You took a man full of sin and hate and rearranged em
You saved em and cleaned his slate and then you gave him
Life forevermore I can't wait for the day
When I see the one who changed my life face to face
What a day that will be I wonder why
Love kept you on that tree just for I
I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you
Maybe dead or in prison maybe broke and confused
All I know is that I'm grateful for what you've done in me
I praise you father God for making me see thatâ€¦
