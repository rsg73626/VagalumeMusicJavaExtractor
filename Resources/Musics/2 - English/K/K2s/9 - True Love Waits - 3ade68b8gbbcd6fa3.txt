TRUE LOVE WAITS

Chorus:
If you wanna be blessed and please the lord
Gotta make sure you keep the wedding bed pure
So on your honeymoon you'll have no guilt or regrets
Practice abstinence and save sex
But you gotta recognize your mentality
Directly affects you sexuality
Gotta strive for a mind of purity
Keep yourself for your spouse
And your spouse only

Verse one:
Not safe but save c'mon yall flee promiscuity
Cause there's no ring on your finger and premarital sex always 
Lingers sometime causing a lot of strife between husband and 
Wife later in life it can also be an emotional bind with disease, babies or a guilty conscience

God didn't make sex to be a cheap thrill so pop the condoms and crush the pill

but I'm in love you say that don't make it legit cause like tina turner what love gotta do wit it

Sex ain't love so don't be deceived true love waits till you are married
And if you're both virgins the first time will be the bomb,
Can't compare her to mary or sue or him to david or tom word is bond
It's hard there's temptation galore but remember god's commandment 
Keep the wedding bed pure to ensure it doesn't accidentally happen check the wise counsel in this rap and
Don't put yourself in situations that cause temptation leading to sin
Hugging, rubbing and feeling is not recommended in fact till your married straight suspend it
That way you won't be tempted to go farther and at the same time you please the father
On a date communicate find out what there about that's the proper route
Hormones may rage but lock em in a cage until that day that you say I do
To you who have feel to sexual sin no need to worry just don't do it again
Make a purity pledge with god and your future mate that no matter what your gonna wait
It may be hard but you'll be pleasing god and kabuc confessing you'll receive the blessing
Cause ain't nothing like the real thing babe on the honeymoon the bride and groom
But its so much fun I just can't stop well fornicators have their place in hell where's it's hot
Take a strong stand with an ounce of pride and also remember to hold your head up high
Cause your not tripping whether your pregnant or not or what disease you might have caught
Cause your saving yourself as you stand on Christ the rock.

Verse two:
I once knew this young man, this mans name was sam,
He was once with this girl and this girl's name was jan
But before he met jan, sam was a party man,
Had sex with many girls but he never told jan
Understand, in the process sam picked up aids and,
Passed it on to jan in the heat of romance
A half a year later both broke up in half,
Then 12 years passed since they saw each other last
Now they're both dead six feet below sand,
Because it wasn't right death was the circumstance
Out there today there's a lot of sam and jan's,
So you better watch out before you get a change of plans
This is dedicated to all of you,
As an encouragement so stay pure and true
Cause I don't want to see you end up like these two,
And all the other people out there acting like fools
You wanna be a real man a real man waits,
Until the honeymoon night to be with his mate
As for me and kabuc that's what we plan to do,
So if we can do it definitely you can do it too,
True love waits!
