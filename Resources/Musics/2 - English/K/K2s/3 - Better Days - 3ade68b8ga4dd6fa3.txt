BETTER DAYS

INTRO:
I used to be in the Dark, now I'm in the light
Walking by faith and not by site
See the Lord above Change my ways
Now I'm living in these bright and shiny better days

So I'm sayin' a bright and shiny day comes after the rain
And goin' through trials deffinately bring you some pain
Double tryin' things to make your straight go insane
Let me share a thing or two wit' you that's on my brain
Now bag a batch, Lookin' at you one more time this K2S
Enough with the stress, it's time to be best
So Please, all attention over here
You don't have to live in fear
You don't even have to cry another tear
Just ask God and he'll make you better
No I ain't talkin about cheddar
But He'll clear up all your weather
Whateva yo situation is God will do it
Cuz God can make your hope Float like Mertey Pewitt
See I was in the pit of Hell when God came with the Key
And I was bounded like a chain when Jesus set me free
Knew everyday that he was shining bright
And with me that's ok
Because God heard my cry
Then he blessed me with these better days

Chorus:
I used to be in the Dark, now I'm in the light
Walking by faith and not by sight
See the Lord above change my ways
Now I'm living in these bright and shiny better days
I used to be in the Dark, now I'm in the light
Walking by faith and not by sight
So what you need to do is to pray
And ask the father in your life
So he can save you and bring you better days

Last Days, Maybe they'll fall away cuz they love sin
And others will fall away because of tribulation
But the K2S be bringin' those words that bring confidence
No matter  yo situation
Sit back and listen
It's been awhile since we've welcomed ya'll to the new era
Life for me hasn't been peachy
Something tried to impeed me
But I had to hold on to a brotha Cherone
And in this trouble life Christ will help you carry on
Christian, I know it ain't easy to walk by faith
It ain't easy to seek his face
It ain't easy to run this race but yo
The other way the wild path will to show ya
This world will be against Ya
But what does it matta, when God is for ya
Like the lawyer Christ has pleaded your case
And what?
So enter into the engine and know better days is comin’
So be of good cheer no need for cryin'
He’ll save you, like he saved me like
Tom Hanks in "Saving Private Ryan"

Chorus

I never thought these days would come
So do you be doubtin’ God so bad
Because you think that he has forgotten
What you got to do
Is be still and let peace reign
And cast your cares upon the Lord
Before you go insane
I know you think you can't take it, you can’t make it
Livin righteous for Christ you about to Foresake it
You feel deeply caught up
Just like yo English Bond
But God hears your cries
And Yo he's drawin 9 (be smooth)
No I'm not saying that I'm perfect
So listen, Total Christ submission
Better days you're wishin'
If this is what you want, see it might take a while
But the Final results are servin' God will be your key spot
See I was in the pit of Hell when God came with the Key
And I was bounded like a chain when Jesus set me free
Knew everyday that he was shining bright
And with me that's ok
Because God heard my cry
Then he blessed me with these better days

Chorus (4x)
