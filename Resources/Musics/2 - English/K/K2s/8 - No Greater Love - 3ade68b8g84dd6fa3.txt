NO GREATER LOVE

Chorus:
I never thought that I would meet someone,
That would give his own life just to give me one
Didn't think there'd be no one to love me for me,
Until you came into my life and you made me see
On my knees everyday thanking god above,
Because of you I see the meaning of no greater love

Verse one:
It's been a long time since the first day you stepped into my life,
You paid the price became my living sacrifice
Since then, I came a long way, so I thank you all day,
Because of you I see the world in so many new ways
I'm not the same man, my life is straight different now,
Sometimes I lay back and ask myself how
Why would this man pay the price for us all,
As I'm thinking to myself on my pillow the tears fall
And yet still....people just don't realize,
The power love has, with their hearts cold as ice
Treating other people as if they were not equal,
Let me tell you one thing... Love sees no evil
I never thought I'd feel love like I feel it now,
I always heard it was good and heard how it felt
Until the day you came in and made it reality,
Took the blinders off my eyes and you made me see.
If you dig deep down inside of your heart, 
You'll find a greater kind of love that's been waiting to start
It's a love that's been here since the beginning of time,
If you show me yours .... Then I'll show you mine
A long time you've been searching, nothing is working,
I've been hurt before now I'm smiling not smirking
You need a love that flows like a river,
Searching for love than come to the love giver.

Chorus

Verse two:
I lay my life down everyday when I get up to pray,
Sometimes my body doesn't budge but I do it anyway
I know it's hard for a man to put aside his pride,
Take all the wrongs in his life and make them into rights
Many times I've been hurt even stabbed in the back,
And if people talk smack.... Of course I feel jacked
But that's wac if I react with the intention,
Physically violent saying words I hate to mention
Stooping to that level boy you know I'm not a buster,
Fighting and killing don't you think we had enough of
But not enough love is spreading through our community,
It's time to come together.... Join hands in unity
My past is gone I'm looking forward to the future now,
And one day before the master we must bow
I had a friend that cared enough for me he died,
So now I live to keep his dream alive
If you dig deep down inside of your heart, 
You'll find a greater kind of love that's been waiting to start
It's a love that's been here since the beginning of time,
If you show me yours .... Then I'll show you mine
A long time you've been searching, nothing is working,
I've been hurt before now I'm smiling not smirking
You need a love that flows like a river,
Searching for love than come to the love giver.

Chorus

Singing chorus:
There's no greater love than the love I have for
you...no greater love
And when you feel like no one's there call on me and I'll be there..
Be there for you
