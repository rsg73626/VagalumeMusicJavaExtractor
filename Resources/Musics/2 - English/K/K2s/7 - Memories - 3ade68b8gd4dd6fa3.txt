MEMORIES

Verse one:
It's been a long time now right about five years
nothing but tears running down my face wishing you were here
Cause life ain't the same no more that your gone
I miss those days you were here now were all alone
I don't know who to blame so all I ask is why
Why did you have to die it wasn't your time
You were still in your prime, you had many days
I miss the way you made me happy in so many ways
Nothing can change what happened but I wish I could
Take a trip back in time and make it all good
I love you so much and I miss you dearly
I wish you were near me everyday wish I can hear you say
Everything's gonna be all right just have faith in God
And one day well meet again even though it's hard
All I want is for you just to see
That I'll always hold close to my heart ...Precious Memories

Chorus:
Since the day you went away I haven't been the same
I think I'm going insane calling out your name
Living life ain't the same since you've been gone
And even though your not here your memory lives on
(2x)

Verse two:
I still remember the day you passed away and left me here on this Earth
How I felt at the church, the hurt when I saw the hearse
Carry your casket to the graveyard, seen your body for the last time
All of these memories flooded my mind
The conversations we had, the times we shared,
The good and bad, happy and sad, you were there
You meant the world to me nobody can replace ya
You’re written on my heart no one can erase ya
I’d give all I own just to have another day
To spend some time with you, make another memory
If I had a clue your days on Earth were about to end
I’d a told you I loved you and hugged you more often
But for now, all I can do is reminece about you
Write a song or two about you but one things true
I'm a see you again in heaven until then
I'll be missing you like 24/7

Chorus till end
