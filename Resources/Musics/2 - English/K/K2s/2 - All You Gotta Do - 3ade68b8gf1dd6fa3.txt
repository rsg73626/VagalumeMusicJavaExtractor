ALL YOU GOTTA DO

Verse one:
There are times in my life when I don't know why
The situation that I'm facing brings a tear to my eye

And I really don't understand why I do

Sinful things everyday while I'm trying to be true

Something new is what I'm looking for where could I find
The answers to the questions in my head give me peace of mind
Because I want to be free,
And I'm tired of all the problems in my life overtaking me
There's gotta be an answer and a better way
So let me say that I'm praying for a better day
In hopes that this day soon will come
And I'll be living in the freedom, the kingdom
Cause that's where I wanna be, I gotta be
In the heavens with the lord for eternity
If I were you believe the word because the word is true
Cast all your cares upon him that's all you gotta do

Chorus:
All you gotta do is get down
Forget about the problems in your life and get down
Put a smile on top of that frown
Cause All you gotta ever gotta do is get down
(2x)

Vocal Hook:
All you gotta do is get down,get down
All I wanna do is get down, get down

Verse two:
I'm blasting harder than ever
Cause like a puzzle I’ve put it together
When you come to see us on tour Check you problems at the door
Get on the dance floor and give praise to the Lord
Whether you smashing down the highway doing 75
Or chilling at the pad checking out this new vibe
Or working like a dog on your 9 to 5
Don't Fret everythings gonna be all right
I'm just here to let you know ain’t no need to do wrong
Just give it to the Father check the 23rd. Psalm
Don't hold that grudge rather forgive just do it
You'll be happy as can be and lighter than starter fluid
Its hard to do right in a world so corrupt
It's hard to press on when you wanna give up
Butcha gotta keep it positive instead of negative
Christ will help you through this first life to live.

Chorus (2x)

Break:
Down, come on get down
K2S, come on get down
get down, get down, down, down

Verse three:
Proud I'm proud of what I am
Holmes I speak the truth so right
Please oh please let this song be
Itself not what you read or write
Oh no, I had a flashback of De La Soul
With everybody in the party feeling good saying ho!!!
Don't let your worries and your problems hold you down
Cause all you gotta ever gotta do is get down, what!
Reverse that frown babe and parlay
Let God lead the way to your brighter day
Hold on stand strong it won't be long
Till all your worries stress and strife is gone.

Chorus

Vocal hook till end
