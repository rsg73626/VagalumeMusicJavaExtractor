ETERNALIFE

Chorus:
It's all good to have a house and expensive cars
Nice coats for your spouse and your living large
It's all right to have Rolexes, to have a Lexus
Mercedes Benz's, money that horrendous
It's OK to live lavious you got to have this
advice in your life so that you might think twice
Why have these things that can burn in an inferno?
As for me I work day by day for something thatâ€™s eternal

Verse one:
I can't believe what's going on now a days
Nothing but praise for these temporary material things
It's everywhere I look on TV and billboards
In movies and magazine pages, even at the awards
Money, gold, fancy cars, diamond rings
It's in the way that they look, it's in the songs that they sing
Not to put it down, cause money makes the world go round
And even for a pound, people lay their whole life down
Now, I'm talking about idol worship, if money's your God
Then that's when it becomes wrong and this is your song
I'm down with cash but it ain't my life center
I'm down with the eternal having fun like Steve Urkel
See it's the root of all evil man I thought you knew
So take control of it before it gets control of you
It isn't all it's cracked up to be
So what you see on TV, most of it's fantasy and...

Chorus

Verse two:
Bling Bling I see these videos cats sporting diamond rings
Bragging bout what they own and all the joy that it brings
And I'll admit at times my flesh be like yeah that's tight
But the Spirit hits and convicts saying that ain't right
Don't get it twisted or you'll miss it living large ain't no sin
But you make mistake when you chase money instead of pursuing him
I know we all struggle trying to live nice so we hustle
Caught up in the bustle trying to flex financial muscle
To meet needs, fulfill dreams and our desires
Everybody wants to be admired for the things that they acquire
Ain't nothing wrong with it if you've been blessed problems start when emphasis
Is placed on making more money than righteousness
I sit back and observe cats who be paperchasin wasting
There energy trying to make a G and live the life they see on BET or MTV
They don't understand that rolle is rented
Gotta be back to the store by 4 or it's a thousand dollars more

Chorus

Verse three:
It's all good you want to try to prosper gee
You wanna be like Dr. Evil but your more like mini-me
On top of the world running things, money endless
You'd do anything for cash even if it left you friendless
A tremendous amount of thought is very necessary
Better pray that your name is found in God's library
Why have these things that can burn in an inferno?
As for me I work day by day for something that eternal
Its difficult to keep focus but remember this
Things attained won't remain cause life is just a mist
The only thing that will last in not that ice on your wrist
But things done for Christ and his purposes
So serve God and not money Serve others not your ego
Cause riches fly like eagles spread wings like seagulls
I'm storing treasure above heavenly currency
That's insured by G.O.D not the FDIC

Chorus till end
