COMMON GROUND

CHORUS:
One love, One goal, One common bond
One voice, one pact, gaining ground that we can both stand on
Stand tall, stand proud, side by side you and I
It's time to let the bygones be and focus on the unity

Joe's verse:
Here we come again with the newfound friends,
With the boom and the bass to bring this problem to an end
Too much talk and not enough love,
Who cares about other denominations
It's all about the Christ who has given us peace,
And showing it to others so that they may see
But instead we got to fight about the smallest things,
Like how tall was Goliath or how small was the sling
It's time to make a change and we'd better do it quick,
Cause I'm running out of breath and my patience wearing thin
A house divided will never stand,
You couldn't agree on the rock so you sunk in the sand
So this is why were here putting out a call,
To open up your eyes so that we can see all
Of the problems, the mishaps and the big mistakes,
To separate the leaders from the phonies and the fakes

Smooth's verse:
Somebody tell me why we do the things we do in church
When you know it hurts your brother,
Were supposed to love one another but instead we down each other
We make each other cry whyâ€¦whatever happened to love?
Were supposed to be the light to the world uplifting God above
To live in unity is the reason why we made this song,
I think I'll quote Rodney so cant we all just get along
So many different beliefs as long as you believe in the son,
Red, black, white, brown all standing on common ground

KaBuc's Verse:
Red, Yellow, Black, Brown, and White
We're all precious in his sight
Unite in Christ is a must
Cause we're Christians Lovers of Jesus
Rush to John 13:34
Love each other as were loved by the Lord
In one accord we're supposed to be
Despite the range of diversity
The world will see by the way
We treat each other if we love Yahweh
Obey James 2 1-13
If someone's different don't treat them mean
Rather unite to fight the good fight
Don't backbite, stay contrite
Invite the new guy out for fellowship
Follow Mark 12:31 despite differences
