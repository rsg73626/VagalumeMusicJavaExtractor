AFTER THE RAIN

Chorus:
A bright shiny day comes after the rain
Your going thru thunder....get ready for change
The mountain your climbing will go away cause
It's all gonna clear up ...after the rain
Vocal chorus
After the rain......all thing’s will change

Verse one:
Another cloudy day, oh my god,
I'm looking out my window and its raining cats and dogs again
Why am I always in this situation? It's really hard to be a christian,
Going through these tribulations
Trials and troubles, problems always double,
Can any one help me out of my struggles?
Bust my bubble if you have to master,
Do anything to take the pain away much faster
I'm on my knees please begging ya, I'm sorry I've forsaken ya,
Forgive me, father god live in me
I had to see it for myself to believe,
When I trusted in the father the rain just ceased
When I was going thru some perilous times,
I didn't think things would get brighter down the line but
He was there when I was feeling the pain,
A bright shiny day came, after the rain.

Chorus

Verse two:
So hold on, keep the faith never give my brotherin,
Indeed on account of christ we will be suffering
It's gonna get brighter child,
Put your trust in the father and he'll help you thru your trial
Smile now, smile later, that's what I do,
Even when I'm struggling I know it's hard to do
How bout you, you think you hit the end of the road,
Too much stress...you feel you're gonna explode
Relax, be still and understand he is the lord,
King of kings, like the family he's the reason why I sing
I can see the clouds on their way,
What to do what to say, be prepared for that day...uhh
Right now it might be raining, maybe even hailing,
You're failing no more smooth sailing
He'll be there when you're going thru the pain,
There's a bright a shiny day is coming for ya, after the rain.

Chorus

Verse three:
Rain drops were falling on my ministry, listen gee, 
Satan tried real hard but he didn’t diminish me
He tried to drown me in the storm water but I had on my scuba gear,
Now I'm in this to the finish gee!
I thank god for the rain cause from that I learned,
When I'm headed towards it I don't make a u-turn
But I keep going forward, always toward,
Even though it's really hard to walk right when it's snowing
Winds blowing hard makes you wanna fall down,
But still serve god all year round
Don't give up, don't throw in your towel,
Finish the race, you gotta keep it going now
If we give up who will kids look up to,
So the future of the world is counting on you
So when a storm is heading your way,
Let it rain......here comes a brighter day!
