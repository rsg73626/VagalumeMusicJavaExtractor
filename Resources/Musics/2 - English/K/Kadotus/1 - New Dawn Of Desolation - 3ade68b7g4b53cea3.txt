NEW DAWN OF DESOLATION

New dawn of desolation opens behind every mind
Desecrating human values
Lying in deep chamber, beyond ruins
Among the rotten corpses

Lost in the dungeons, wandering away
Torch withered by hate, searching new dawn of desolation...

Silent is the truth when it's founded

Chained in worthless life
Where evil dwells
