SINISTER ANTHEMS

The art of lust unchained
Angels falling down to drown in sin
Shapes moving towards the purified whore
Reign of tyranny melting into the human mind

Sinister anthems echoing as perversions bound
the inferior being (parasite) under the inhuman reign

Soon the body collapses, death taking reign
Still the art continues for Satan
The final gaze into the realm of hate
As the thorns impale the shell filled with worms
Skull risen to rot in the name of hate
