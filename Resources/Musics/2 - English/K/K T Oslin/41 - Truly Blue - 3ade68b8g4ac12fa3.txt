TRULY BLUE

You said you saw me 
I was with another guy 
Said it made you 
Want to go home and cry 
Well I know just how you feel 
Well baby I caught you 
But I never let you know that you’d been caught 
But the straw that broke my camel’s back 
Was that blonde too stupid to talk 
I swore I’d get even, even if it’s the last thing I do 
Now I’m just sitting here waiting for sweet revenge 
You know somebody told me it’s sweet as sweet has ever been 
Well that somebody lied, honey all I do is cry 
I evened it up the score but I went and lost the war 
(Chorus:) 
And now I’m truly blue since I don’t have you 
If I wrote my feelings down in a letter to you 
I’d have to sign it yours truly blue 
But now Miss Know-It-All 
I’m sittin’ here all alone 
Yeah once in a while I pick up my phone 
To see if the thing’s still on 
‘Cause it ain’t ringing, ringing 
I bet your phone is ringing off the wall 
And honey oh how I miss you 
And if you were here I’d kiss you 
Baby but baby you’re somebody else’ baby now 
(Repeat Chorus) 
I’d have to sign it you
