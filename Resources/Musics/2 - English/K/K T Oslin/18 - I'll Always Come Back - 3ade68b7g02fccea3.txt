I'LL ALWAYS COME BACK

Oh there's a nursery rhyme it's a fovorite of mine
Bout a little girl and some sheeps that she could not find
They told her not to worry they'd come back
Darling you're my shepherd I'm your little lamb
You ain't always gonna know where I am
Oh but don't you worry I'll come back

I'll always come back baby to you
I'll always run back straight to you
I'll never get too far away from you
I'll never get too lost that I can't be found
And I'm never gonna swim too far out I might drown
And I'll always come back come back baby to you

There's a wooden wonder from way down under they call a boomerang
If you handle it right it'll come back
If you must have had one when you were a boy
Cause you've got the touch that turns me into a toy
And like a boomerang I'll come back

Keep your eyes on the horizon and when you start to missin' me
Just look out your window and there I'll be

Cause I'll always come back baby to you...
I'll always come back come back baby to you
