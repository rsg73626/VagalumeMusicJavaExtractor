LOVE IS STRANGE

Love, love is strange 
Lots of people 
Take it for a game 
And once you get it 
You don’t ever want to quit 
And after you’ve had it 
You’re in an awful fix 
Lots of people 
Don’t understand 
They think love is money in his hand 
You sweet love is better than a kiss 
And when you leave me 
Your kisses I’ll miss 
Somebody asked me, they said, “K.T. how do call you call your lover boy?” 
I say come here lover boy 
And they say, “If he doesn’t answer?” 
Oh I say, oh lover boy And if he still doesn’t answer 
I simply say 
Baby, my sweet baby 
My sweet baby you’re the one 
Come on baby, my sweet baby 
My sweet baby you’re the one 
You’re the one, you’re the one
