HEY BOBBY

Hey Bobby 
Would you like to go for a ride in the country with me 
I’m celebrating 
You see the four-wheel beauty you’re leaning on 
Well it finally belongs to me 
I never owned a car before 
And I never picked a boy up 
At his own front door 
It’ll be a red-letter day 
If you’ll come out and play in the country with me 
Hey Bobby 
We’ll ride a little ways down 299 
To a lovely little spot I found 
To a lovely little spot I found 
It’s on a hilltop 
We can park in the shade and dance on the ground 
To a radio station where the hits don’t ever stop 
Watch the sun go down, see the moon rise up 
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup 
Rock the night away 
Looking at stars, talking about cars, Bobby and me 
(Chorus:) 
(Hey Bobby 
Do ya’ wanna huh 
Do ya’ wanna huh huh 
Do ya’ 
Watch the sun go down see the moon rise up 
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup 
In future times to be when you need a good memory 
Bobby think about me 
Hey Bobby 
(Repeat Chorus)
