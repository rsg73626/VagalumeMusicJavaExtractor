I’LL GET YOU BACK

I’ll Get You Back, wait and see. 
I learned my lesson, foolishly. 
I hurt you, I was wrong, 
Now let me make it right. 

I saw that apple hanging on the tree. 
A low-down snake held it up to me. 
It was shame, I was weak, 
So I took a bite. 

Forbidden fruit is so delicious, 
But it has a way of turning vicious on you. 
Temptation, its so seldom satisfying. 
That forky tongue is always lying to you, 
trying to fool you. 

But I’ll get you back, get back in, 
And share the garden with you again. 
I’m hopin’, prayin’ that I’ll get you back.

I’m hopin’, prayin’ that I’ll get you back. 
(Wait and see) I’ll get you back, 
(Foolish me) I’ll get you back, 
(Hopefully) I’ll get you back, 
(Wait and see) I’ll get you back, 
(Foolish me) I’ll get you back.
