THIS WOMAN

I can still see your head on the pillow 
I can still smell your manly perfume 
I can still hear your heart, heart a-beating 
Honey long after you’ve left the room 
I’m thinking about you when, when I’m working 
You’re breaking my power to concentrate 
Oh, better be careful ‘cause I might get fired 
For thinking ‘bout the fire we started yesterday 
(Chorus:) 
(This woman’s in love with you baby 
This woman don’t think you can do no wrong 
But I feel it’s only fair to warn you 
This woman don’t stay in love for long) 
And I will swear that I love, love you forever 
And when forever is over I’m gonna be kind 
‘Cause I don’t see any reason 
To leave a heart all broken and bleedin’ 
Especially when that bleedin’ heart might be mine 
‘Cause one day I’ll roll over 
And it’ll be over simple as that 
One day I’ll roll over it’ll be over simple as that 
(Repeat Chorus)
