MISS THE MISSISSIPPI AND YOU

I’m growing tired of the big cities lights. 
I’m tired if the glamour tired of the sites. 
In all my dreams I am home once more. 
Back to my home on the old river shore. 

I’m sad and weary everywhere I go. 
Miss the Mississippi and you. 
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam. 
Miss the Mississippi and you. 

Roaming the wide world over. 
Seems I’m always alone and blue. 
Nothing seems to cheer me underneath Heavens door. 
Miss the Mississippi and you. 

Yo di o ledi 
Mississippi and you 

Memories are bringing happy days of yours. 
Miss the Mississippi and you dear. 
Mockingbirds are sing all around the cabin door. 
Miss the Mississippi and you. 

Roaming the wide world over. 
Seems I’m always alone and blue. 
Nothing seems to cheer me underneath Heavens door. 
Miss the Mississippi and you. 

Yo di o ledi 
Mississippi and you
