CLEAN YOUR OWN TABLES

Well I ain’t exactly been what you call your all American girl, 
Some too many truckers took me home. 
I’ll admit my life reads just like a paperback, 
Some of what I’ve done I say is wrong. 

(Chorus:) 
But I say clean your own tables boys and bring out the beer 
Cause I ain’t gonna do it this time 
And drink to a used to be bar maid 
And be the man that I choose to be mine. 

Well he ain’t exactly been what you call your all American boy, 
Done time in Frisco and LA. 
Some of you have taken pride in what I am, 
Heard you cussin’ each decision that I made. 

(Chorus:) 
I say clean your own tables boys and bring out the beer 
Cause I ain’t gonna do it this time 
And drink to a used to be bar maid 
And be the man that I choose to be mine. 

I say clean your own tables boys and bring out the beer 
Cause I ain’t gonna do it this time 
And drink to a used to be bar maid 
And be the man that I choose to be mine. 

Boys if you’re able clean your own tables 
And let me take care of mine.
