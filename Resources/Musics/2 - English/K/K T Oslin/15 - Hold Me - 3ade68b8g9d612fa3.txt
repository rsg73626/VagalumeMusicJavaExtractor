HOLD ME

[Husband comes home and he says, “Wife turn down the radio, turn off the t.v., and listen to me. Let me tell you about my day.” So she sits down and she listens and he begins to speak.] 
When I left here this morning 
I was bound and determined 
I was never gonna come back 
Never, never, I was running 
I was running from you darling 
I was running from my job 
I was running from the kid in me 
He never knows when to stop 
Got as far as the edge of town 
Then I turned my car around 
And headed back to you 
[Husband says, “Wife, what do you think?” Wife says, “It’s very interesting. Before we talk about your day let’s talk about mine.”] When I left here this morning 
I was bound and determined 
I was never gonna come back 
Never, never, I was running 
I was running from you darling 
I was running from my job 
I was running from some wrinkles 
No cream will stop 
Got as far as the edge of town 
Then I turned my car around 
And headed back to you 
(Chorus:) Come here and hold me, tighter 
Tell me tomorrow will be brighter 
Kiss me, kiss me a little harder 
Don’t kiss like we’re married 
Kiss me like we’re lovers 
We looked at each other 
And we started to grin 
This morning it was over 
This evening we’ll start it all over again 
Come her and hold me, hold me tighter 
Won’t you tell me tomorrow’ll be brighter 
Won’t you kiss me, kiss me, kiss me a little harder 
Honey don’t kiss me like we’re married 
Kiss me like we’re lovers and hold me 
Hold me, hold me
