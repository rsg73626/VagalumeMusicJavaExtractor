WALL OF TEARS

Looking out my window staring through the pain
I can't see the rainbow for the rain
Someday I'll forget you life goes on they say
But they don't know what's standing in my way

There's a wall of tears I got to get over
Got to stop thinking of you got to learn not to love you
I know the sun will shine I'm gonna be fine but until then
The rain's gonna fall just like a wall of tears

Another morning finds me I'm still not over you
It's just another day to stumble through
Now my nights go on forever I've got nothing but time
And even time can't mend this heart of mine

Cause there's a wall of tears...
