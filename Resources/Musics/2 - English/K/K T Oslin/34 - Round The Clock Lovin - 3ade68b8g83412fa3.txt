ROUND THE CLOCK LOVIN

I don’t need your hard-earned money 
Honey, I’ve got money of my own 
I don’t need your helpful instructions 
To help me get to where I’m going 
I don’t need you to drive me downtown 
In your big shiny car 
My needs are simple if you’ll just sit down 
I’m gonna tell you what they all are 
(Chorus:) 
(All I need is ‘round the clock lovin’ 
Rolling easy loving the hours away 
All I need is ‘round the clock lovin’ 
I need it twenty-rour hours every day) 
I don’t need your mother’s phone calls 
Waking me up in the night 
Asking me “Well, what are ya’ll doing?” 
And “Are you treating my baby right?” 
I don’t need your good time buddies 
Spilling their beer on my floors 
In case you missed it the first time ‘round 
I’m gonna run it back one time more 
(Repeat Chorus) 
I don’t need designer dresses 
Perfume from Paris, France 
All that stuff just ain’t enough 
To make my little heart get up and dance 
I don’t need your diamond necklace 
Shimmering around my neck 
That’s not what makes me sparkle 
Honey, do you have the picture yet? 
(Repeat Chorus)
