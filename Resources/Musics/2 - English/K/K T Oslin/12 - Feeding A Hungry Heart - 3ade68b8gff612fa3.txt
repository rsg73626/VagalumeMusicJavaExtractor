FEEDING A HUNGRY HEART

She would be so pretty 
If she’d only lose that weight 
Women can’t be thin enough, you know 
Instead of eating take-out 
She should be out on a date 
Not dining with a demon that she can’t control 
So misunderstood 
She’d stop it if she could 
Heaven knows the hell she feels inside 
(Chorus:) 
(Cause she’s/he’s feeding a hungry heart 
Trying to fill the empty part 
She’s/He’s starving 
From a hungry heart) 
He’s out there every morning 
Way before dawn 
Running like a man whose heart is on fire 
Racing past his feelings 
On his daily marathon 
His loneliness is lessened by the miles and miles 
Up and down the hill, 
Oh, so much time to kill 
Heaven knows the hell he’s running from 
(Repeat Chorus) 
{Tag:} 
{Cause they’re thirsting for happiness 
Drowning in their own excess 
They’re starving 
From a hungry heart} 
(Repeat Chorus and Tag} 
Oh, starving from a hungry heart 
Oh, starving from a hungry heart
