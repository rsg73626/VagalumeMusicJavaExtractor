SHE DON'T TALK LIKE US NO MORE

Used to be my very best friend, we went everywhere together
Even shared a boyfriend once or twice
She was never satisfied, nothing 'round here suited her
She never phones, she never writes
Old friend, that ain't right

She don't talk like us no more
(she) done run off and got certified
She don't act like us no more since she moved away
Using words she never used before
(she's) almost as skinny as a movie star
She don't even walk like us no more

Now when she visits you'd think minor royalty'd come to town
All she does is talk about the city
And she puts all the local stuff down
She never asks me how I've been or what I've been up to
It's a lesson in geography
Ain't it amazing what a few miles can do

She don't talk like us no more
(she)done run off and got certified
She don't act like us no more since she moved away
Using words she never used before
(she's) almost as skinny as a movie star
She don't even walk like us no more

I don't believe how uppity she's gotten, do you believe it
Honey who, who does she think she is
Yeah I don't believe how uppity she's gotten, do you believe it
Oh honey who, who does she think is
