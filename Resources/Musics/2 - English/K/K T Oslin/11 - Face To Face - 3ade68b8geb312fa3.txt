FACE TO FACE

Run your fingers through my hair and softly kiss my lips 
Hold me close in your embrace and love me face to face 
(Chorus:) 
(Face to face 
Heart to heart 
Body to body 
Tingling tangle feelings 
Lovers face to face) 
I’ll caress your body and hold you close to me 
I’ll slide my hands around your waist 
and love you face to face 
(Chorus:) 
Face to face 
Heart to heart 
Body to body 
Lips on lips 
Arm and arm 
Body to body 
Tingling tangle feelings 
Lovers face to face 
{K.T.’s Part:} 
{Softly say you love me 
As you make love to me 
No one else can take your place 
We happen face to face}
