A HEART NEEDS A HOME

I know the way that I feel about you. 
I’m never gonna run away. 
I’m never gonna run away. 
I never knew the way that I lived without you. 
I’m never gonna run away. 
I’m never gonna run away. 
I came to you when no one could hear me. 
I’m sick and weary of being alone. 
Empty streets and hungry faces. 
The world’s no place when you’re on your own. 
A heart needs a home. 

Some people say that I should forget you. 
I’m never gonna be a fool. 
I’m never gonna be a fool. 
A better life, they say, if I’d never met you. 
I’m never gonna be a fool. 
I’m never gonna be a fool. 

Tongues talk fire and eyes cry rivers. 
Indian givers, hearts of stone. 
Paper ships and painted faces. 
The world’s no place when you’re on your own. 
A heart needs a home 

They I should forget you. 
They say I should have met you. 
I’m never gonna be a fool. 
I’m never gonna be a fool. 
Never gonna be a fool. 
Never gonna be a fool.
