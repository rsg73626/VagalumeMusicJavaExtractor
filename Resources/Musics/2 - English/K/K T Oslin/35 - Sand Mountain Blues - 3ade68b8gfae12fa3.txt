SAND MOUNTAIN BLUES

Raining on sand mountain, its raining kinda slow. 
When I leave sand mountain well I got no place to go. 
Lonesome feeling sand mountain blues. 

I went to the gypsy woman to just hear what she had to say. 
She said that man don’t love you and you better be on your way. 
He’s going to be sorry for breaking your heart 

There’s other boys around here, 
I could probably learn to love another one or two. 
But its a small town baby and everywhere I go I keep running into you. 

There’s other boys around here, 
I could probably learn to love another one or two. 
But its a small town baby and everywhere I go I keep running into, running into you. 
Sand Mountain Blues. 

And everywhere I go I keep running into you. 
You gonna be sorry for breaking my heart. 
Lonesome feeling Sand Mountain blues. Sand Mountain Blues. 
Sand Mountain Blues.
