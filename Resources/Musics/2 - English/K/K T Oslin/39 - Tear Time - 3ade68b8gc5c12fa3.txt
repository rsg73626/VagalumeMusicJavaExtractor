TEAR TIME

Tear time starts without warning 
Sometimes nigh sometimes warning 
All it takes is the smallest thought of you 
And then tear time 
Starts crying all night though 

(Tear) Its that time again 
(Tear Time) Crying time again 
(Starts) All the hurt begins 
Without warning 
(Some) Days my eyes stay dry 
(Sometimes) I forget but why 
(Why it) Brings new tears to cry until morning 

All it takes is the smallest thought of you 
And then tear time 
Starts crying all night though
