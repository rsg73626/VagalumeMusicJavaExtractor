YOU CALL EVERYBODY DARLING

Tho’ you’re always waxing sentimental 
And sweet words are all I ever hear 
You don’t really give a continental 
Deep down in your heart you’re not sincere 
You call everybody darling 
And everybody calls you darling too 
You don’t mean what you’re sayin’ 
It’s just a game you’re playin’ 
But you’ll find someone else 
Can you play the game as well as you 
If you call everybody darling 
Then love won’t come a knockin’ at your door 
And as the years go by 
You’ll sit and wonder why 
Nobody calls you darling anymore
