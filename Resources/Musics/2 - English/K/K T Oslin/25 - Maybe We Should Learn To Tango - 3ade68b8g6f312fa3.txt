MAYBE WE SHOULD LEARN TO TANGO

We tried a little time away from each other, 
It worked for awhile. 
We had candle light dinner, we made love like sinners, 
And it worked for awhile. 
Now its getting harder to make my baby smile. 

So maybe we should learn to tango. 
I’ll melt into your arms and you’ll tell me with your eyes, 
Its gonna be alright. 
Or maybe it’s just time we let go, 
Only diamonds last forever, even diamonds lose their shine. 
Are we wasting precious time? 
So let me know. 
Do I stay or do you go? 
Do we ever do we float? 

Or maybe it’s just time we let go, 
Only diamonds last forever, and diamonds lose their shine. 
Are we wasting precious time? 
So let me know. 
Do I stay or do you go? 
Do we ever do we float? 

Maybe we should learn to tango baby, 
Or maybe its time to go.
