JEALOUS

I see you every day 
But you don’t see me, no you hardly even look my way 
No your eyes are only for her 
And her eyes are often gazing another’s way 
She makes me jealous 
She makes you jealous too 
You’re jealous of these other fellas 
I’m just jealous about you 
Ain’t it a funny, ain’t it a joke 
The only heart that’s cheating 
Is the only heart that ain’t being broke 
She makes me so jealous 
And honey I, I oughta run up to you 
And tell you myself you know she’s throwing your love away 
Find the nearest sunset and love your night into a lovely day 
Honey if I could wouldn’t life be fine but here 
I stand afraid to try I’m rooted to this pot just like a tree, oh heartache, or misery (Repeat Chorus) 
Honey her cheating heart is the only heart that ain’t being broke 
She makes me so jealous 
Now I can’t help it she makes me jealous 
Oh, oh, oh so jealous 
I’m gonna go on jealous 
I just can’t help it she makes me jealous 
Oh she makes me so jealous
