DO YA

Do you still get a thrill when ya see me comin' up the hill?
Honey, now do ya?
Do ya whisper my name just to bring a little comfort to ya?
Do ya?
Do ya still like the feel of my body lyin' next to ya?
Well, I guess what I'm askin'
Do you still love me?

Oh, do you lie awake thinkin' I'm the biggest mistake you ever made?
Honey, now do ya?
And if just by snappin' your fingers 
You could snap them fingers and make it all go away.
Honey, now would ya?
Do ya miss me when I'm gone 
But sometimes wish that I'd stay gone just a little bit longer?
Well, I guess what I'm askin'
Is do you still love me?

'Cause honey, I sure do still love you.
At least I think I do.
And these questions I'm askin' 
You could ask them of me too.

Do ya still get a thrill when ya see me comin' up the hill
Honey, now do ya?
Oh, do ya?
Do ya whisper my name just to bring a little comfort to ya?
Do ya?
Do you still like the feel of my body lyin' next to ya?
Whoa-oa-oa yeah
Well I guess what I'm askin'
Is do you still love me?
Yes, I guess what I'm askin'
Is do ya still love me, do ya?
Do ya?
Oh, do ya?
