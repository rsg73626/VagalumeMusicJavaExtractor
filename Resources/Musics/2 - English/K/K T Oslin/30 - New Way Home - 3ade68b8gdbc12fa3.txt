NEW WAY HOME

Slowly I’m healin’ 
Broken hearts take a little time 
Now that I’m feelin’ stronger 
Time I changed one last pattern of mine 
(Chorus:) 
(I have to find 
Me a new way home 
I can’t be drivin’ by your house no more 
How’s that old sayin’ go 
You better leave well enough alone 
And find a new way home 
I have to find a new way home 
I have to find a new way home) 
Have to drive an extra mile or two 
What else can I do 
I don’t want to see 
Cause someday I’ll see 
Somethin’ I don’t want to see 
And it’ll only break my heart all over again 
Can’t afford it my friend 
This’ll have to end 
It’s the only heart I got 
And it needs a little more time to mend 
(Repeat Chorus) I have to find a new way home 
Gotta find it 
I have to find a new way home 
Gotta find it
