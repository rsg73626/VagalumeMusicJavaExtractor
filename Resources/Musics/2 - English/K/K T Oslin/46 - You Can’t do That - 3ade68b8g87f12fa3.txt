YOU CAN’T DO THAT

I remember breakfast 
Used to be my favorite meal 
Big ol’ eggs and lots of butter 
Food you could feel 
Now it’s figs and wigs fiber 
I’m pure as I can be 
Devils call, angels fall 
I want my BLT 
(Chorus:) 
(You can’t do that 
You can’t do that 
There’s no eating, cheating, treating 
You can’t do that 
You can’t do that 
You can’t do that) 
Well, let’s talk about my lovelife 
It used to be so free. 
If I saw something I wanted. 
I just drag it on home with me 
Now you’re talking blood tests and sexual history 
Aw, it used to be fun, 
To do run, run 
Now it’s life and destiny. 
(Repeat Chorus) 
{Tag:} Don’t say it feels good 
Don’t you do it 
If it tastes good 
Throw it away 
It’s a sad truth 
Don’t deny it 
If you’re gonna play, you’re gonna pay} 
They don’t read the constitution, 
Down there where I work 
My boss thinks he’s a Romeo 
I think he’s a jerk 
He’s always making passes 
He’s got hands in back of his head 
He’d love to see me naked 
Honey, I’d love to see him dead 
(Repeat Chorus)
