OO-WEE

Lets just stay in bed all day 
Don’t worry about the bills 
That we have to pay 
Let’s call in sick 
Let’s play hookey all day 
And then let’s ooh, ooh wee 
Order in our favorite Chinese food 
Wash it all down 
With a nice cold brew 
We could watch that good old movie 
On channel two 
Or we could ooh, ooh we 
(Chorus:) 
(Ooh, ooh wee 
In harmony 
How sweet it will be 
When we ooh, ooh wee) 
I’m gonna be a damsel in distress 
You be the knight in armor 
That hears my SOS 
Slay that dragon 
And come rescue me 
Then let’s ooh, ooh wee 
(Repeat Chorus) 
When we ooh, ooh wee 
Honey, you and me 
Yeah, in harmony 
Let’s ooh, ooh wee 
How sweet it will be 
How sweet it will be
