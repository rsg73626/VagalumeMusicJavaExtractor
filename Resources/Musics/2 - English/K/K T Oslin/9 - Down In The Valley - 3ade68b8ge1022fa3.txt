DOWN IN THE VALLEY

You know I’m down in the valley, 
In the valley so low. 
Gonna hang my head over, 
Just to hear the wind blow. 

Hear the wind blowing. 
Hear the wind blow. 
Hang you head over. 
Just hear the wind blow. 

You know the roses love sunshine. 
The purdy violets love the dew. 
The angels in Heaven. 
They know I love you. 

I’m gonna build me a tower, 
Build it 40 feet high. 
So could lean out the window, 
Just to see you riding by. 

I’m down in the valley, 
The valley and I’m feeling low. 
I’m gonna hang my head over, 
Just to hear the wind blow.

I’m down in the valley, 
In the valley feeling low. 
Gonna hang my head over, 
Just to hear the wind blow.
