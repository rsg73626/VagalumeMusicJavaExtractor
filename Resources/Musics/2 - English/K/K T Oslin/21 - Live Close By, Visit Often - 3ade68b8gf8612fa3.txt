LIVE CLOSE BY, VISIT OFTEN

I love ya baby 
I like your company 
You make me laugh 
You never make me cry 
I think you’re sexy 
I like to kiss ya 
Even my dog thinks you’re quite a guy 

I’m not lookin for a husband 
Found out the hard way it doesn’t work for me 
I need a friend 
I want a lover 
I have to be alone occasionally 

(Chorus) 
So live Close by, visit often 
That’ll work, that’ll work for me 
Live close by, visit often 
Save us both a lot of misery 

You fix me breakfast 
I’ll buy you dinner 
We’ll hit a movie on Wednesday night 
You go to your place 
I’ll go to my place 
Sounds like our plan is gonna work just right 

(Chorus) 
Live close by, visit often 
That’ll work, that’ll work for me 
Live close by, visit often 
Save us both a lot of misery 

It could be rough 
It could be easy 
It might be hell 
Might be heavenly 
How do you feel? 
How does it strike ya? 
Could you be happy with a woman like me? 
Why don’t ya? Why don’t ya? 

(Chorus) 
Live close by, visit often 
That’ll work, that’ll work for me 
Live close by, visit often 
Save us both a lot of misery 

Live close by, visit often...
