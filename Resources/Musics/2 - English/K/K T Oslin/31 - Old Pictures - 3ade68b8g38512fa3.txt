OLD PICTURES

There’s a little girl playing dress up 
Somewhere under all that lace 
Standing in her momma’s high heels shoes 
With a lipstick covered face 
Here’s a little boy on a pony 
He’s a cowboy all the way 
Used to pull my hair and make me mad 
At the Saturday matinee 
Oh who’d have thought I’d lose my heart 
To the same little boy someday 
(Chorus:) 
(Looking through my old pictures 
Faded photographs 
Some of them bring me close to tears 
Others make me laugh 
Old memories seem to come alive 
And open up the past again 
And let me dream inside) 
Here’s brother with his very first automobile 
We thought he’d wash the paint away 
He took a job that took him west 
He’s doing very well 
But we don’t see much of brother these days 
This is my favorite of my paw-paw 
He’s dressed up in his Sunday suit 
Wide brimmed hat 
A watch on a chain 
I’m gonna tell you the truth 
It’s a picture of a downright handsome man 
Caught in the prime of his youth 
(Repeat Chorus)
Ooh, ooh, who taught time to fly 
Ooh, ooh, who taught those years to just roll on by 
(Repeat Chorus)
