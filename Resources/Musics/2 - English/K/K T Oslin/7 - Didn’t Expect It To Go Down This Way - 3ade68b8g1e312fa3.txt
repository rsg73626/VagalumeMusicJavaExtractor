DIDN’T EXPECT IT TO GO DOWN THIS WAY

I’m overworked and I’m overweight 
I can’t remember when I last had a date 
Oh I didn’t expect it to go down this way 
I used to love and I used to be loved 
And now love’s a scary thing to think of 
Oh I didn’t expect it to go down this way 
Been dating for years, honey that ain’t natural 
I thought by now I’d find my man and settle down 
Ain’t a good one left in town 
I’m lonely, how in the world did I end up lonely 
I know life would be hard, but I didn’t know how hard 
I thought by now I’d be happy who’s happy, honey not me 
I’m lonely, how in the world did I end up lonely 
Oh I didn’t expect it to go down this way 
No I didn’t expect it to go down this way 
No I didn’t expect it to go down this way
