TWO HEARTS

You’re the picture of lonely if I ever saw one 
Sitting at that table so all alone 
Don’t know what happened, I don’t know your story 
But if you had somebody I think you’d probably be home 
Hope you don’t mind if I sit down beside you 
I believe that we’re two of a kind 
It could be better if we were together 
‘Cause hurtin’ together beats hurtin’ alone 
(Chorus:) 
(Two hearts are better than one 
Two hearts keep the pain on the run 
When its all night and the night’s just begun 
Don’t you know two hearts 
Two hearts are better than one) 
Honey we don’t have to face this all by our lonesome 
All tied up by heartache, surrounded by blue 
We found each other, don’t you know the hardest part is over 
Now it’s just a matter of following through 
We can hold on as the night swirls around us 
Sheltered in each other’s arms 
Oh and it could be better if we were together 
‘Cause hurting together beats hurting alone 
(Repeat Chorus)
