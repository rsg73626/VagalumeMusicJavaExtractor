WHERE IS A WOMAN TO GO

Doo-Da, Doo-Da, Doo-Da, Doo-Da Day 
Maybe he was wrong, maybe I wasn’t even right 
Whatever the reason I’m on my own tonight 
He’s gone a his way and I’ve gone mine 
But I’ll bet you get that story all the time 
Sometimes your friends ain’t always available 
To pick you up when you’re feelin’ down, down, down, down 
You know my daddy would die if he knew his baby 
Was seekin’ refuge in a little ol’ bar ‘cross town 
(Chorus:) 
(But tell me where is a woman to go 
When she’s feelin’ low 
And all she wants to do is feel a little better 
Tell me where is a woman to go 
When she’s feelin’ low 
All she wants to do is feel a little better) 
Hey bartender honey gimme change for a ten dollar bill 
Bring in back as stack of quarters, if you will 
‘Cause I’m gonna play every song on your jukebox that makes me cry 
Gonna find out how many tears ten dollars can buy 
(Repeat Chorus) 
All she wants to do is feel a little better 
Tell me where is woman to go 
When she’s feelin’ low 
And all she wants to do is feel a little better 
Doo-Da, Doo-Da, Doo-Da, Doo-Da Day 
I said Doo-Da, Doo-Da, Doo-Da, Doo-Da Day
