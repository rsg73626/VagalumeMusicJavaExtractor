I DON’T REMEMBER YOUR NAME

[From The Thing Called Love Soundtrack]

{Spoken:} 
There’s an institution in the South called the beer joint. 
And among the patrons is usually a woman around 45 40 on a real good day. 
She comes into the bar all by herself, sits down, orders a beer and drinks it about of a bottle. 
Usually got a big beehive hairdue that’s colored orange. 
Well one night she’s sitting in the bar and a guy comes in and he sits a little ways down from her. 
She turns looks at him and smiles walks over and its down and says,

{Music}
Why hello say haven’t we met?
Oh yes, it was last year right here at the bar.
She says honey I sure hope I don’t hurt your feelings when I tell you this 
But I don’t remember your name but I remember you. 
We were two people who were tired of the lives we lived 
We both were looking for a change. 
When you told me your story, I listened, and I told you mine, 
We spent the evening making everything right. 

You’re looking fine and I’m glad to tell you I’m feeling happy too 
Oh you still got those pretty eyes and that sweet smile. 
I don’t remember your name but I remember you.

{Spoken} 
Well they sat there at the bar laughing and talking. 
And every now and then she’d look in the mirror, 
And hanging above their heads was one of those Millers highlight signs. 
You know the kind I mean, got a clock on one side and a sailboat on the other. 
{Music} 
You told me your story, I listened, and then I told you mine. 
We spent the evening making everything right. 
I’m glad your looking so fine and I’m glad to tell you I’m feeling happy too. 
I’m no longer set in blue.
You still got those pretty eyes and that sweet smile. 
I don’t remember you name but I remember you.

I’m sorry I forgot your name but I remember you.
