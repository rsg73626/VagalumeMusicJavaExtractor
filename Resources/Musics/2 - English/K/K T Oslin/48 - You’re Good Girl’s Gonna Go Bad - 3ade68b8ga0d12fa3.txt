YOU’RE GOOD GIRL’S GONNA GO BAD

[From the 1998 Tammy Wynette Tribute]

I’ve never seen the inside of a bar room 
Or listened to a jukebox all night long 
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure 
So I’m gonna make some changes in our home 
I’ve heard it said: “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” 
So if that’s the way you’ve wanted me to be 
I’ll change if it takes that to make you happy 
From now on you’re gonna see a different me. 
(Chorus:) 
(Because your good girl’s gonna go bad 
I’m gonna be the swingin’est swinger you’ve ever had 
If you like ‘em painted up powdered up 
Then you oughta be glad 
‘Cause your good girl’s gonna go bad.) 
I’ll even learn to like the taste of whiskey 
In fact, you’ll hardly recognize your wife 
I’ll buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy 
For my journey to the wilder side of life. 
(Repeat Chorus) 
Oh! Yeah! Your good girl’s gonna go bad.
