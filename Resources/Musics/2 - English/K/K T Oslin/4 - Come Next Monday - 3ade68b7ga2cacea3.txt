COME NEXT MONDAY

Come next Monday
I'm goin' to bed early
I won't talk dirty for a week or two
Goin' on a diet
Just like sugar, honey
Come next Monday 
I'm gonna give up on you

(Givin it up) (Givin it up) 

X-rays show some
Excess baggage
Too much work for a little hard to do
Self-denial
Is never easy baggage
But Come next Monday 
I'm gonna give up on you

Aint gonna call you
After a day or two
Aint gonna miss you honey
An even if i do

I'll never tell you
You'll never ever know
How hard it is
To let you go

Come next Monday
I hope i'm a little bit stronger
Some of the mondays that i've been through
Tempation Tuesday 
Might be sorry
But come next Monday
I'm gonna give up on you

Aint gonna call you
After a day or two
Aint gonna miss u honey
An even if I do

I'll never tell you
You'll never ever know
How hard it is
To let you go

Come next Monday
I'm goin to bed early
I wont talk dirty for a week or maybe two
I'm goin on a diet 
Just like sugar, honey
Come next monday
Im gonna give up on you

(Givin it up)
Come next monday 
I'm gonna give up you

(Givin it up)
I'm givin it up
