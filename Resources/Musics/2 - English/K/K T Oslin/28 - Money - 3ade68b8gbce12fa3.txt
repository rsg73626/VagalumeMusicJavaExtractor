MONEY

Money let’s me fly to Paris for lunch 
And money puts caviar on the crackers I munch 
It’ll let me buy all kinds of expensive this and that 
But I’ll tell you a secret about money 
I been keepin’ undermy designer hat 
(Chorus:) 
(You know money ain’t what I need 
A dollar bill can’t give me kiss 
When a little kiss is all I need 
It can’t take me for a ride in the country 
Or walkin’ in the rain 
Money never feels any joy 
Honey it sure don’t feel any pain 
I don’t need money, all I need is you, oh, oh) 
Oh, oh, ‘cause honey, honey, honey without you I’d be dining alone 
Surrounded by those things I bought 
And they still don’t make my house my house 
What good is drinkin’ your coffee from a costly cup 
If you’re drinkin’ it all by yourself when the sun comes up 
(Repeat Chorus) 
All I need is you 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Honey, honey don’t need money 
All I need is you
