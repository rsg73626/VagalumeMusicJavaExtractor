PATHWAY OF TEARDROPS

A pathway of teardrops will show you the way, 
If you ever want to come back to me.

I want you to know dear that I cried all night and day. 
Since you told me you’d never be free. 

I loved you so but I let you go. 
Now I’m sending a message to you. 

A pathway of teardrops will show you the way, 
If you ever want to come back to me 

I loved you so but I let you go. 
Now I’m sending a message to you. 

A pathway of teardrops will show you the way, 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever want to come back 
If you ever come back baby to me
