LONELY BUT ONLY FOR YOU

My friends set me up with someone they know I'll just love they say
Oh he's just your type he's just the right one to chase your blues away
Friends are such good arrangers but I'm not in the mood for strangers

Honey I'm lonely but only for you
I'm only lonely for all the things we used to do
Hey I can function quite well hey you can hardly tell
That I'm lonely but only for you yes I'm lonely but only for you

Now I miss the love the touch that melted night into dawn
Oh I miss the talks I miss that shoulder I know I could lean on
It's the same old story no one else does anything for me

Honey I'm lonely but only for you...
I'm so lonely but only for you
