GET BACK IN THE SADDLE

I remember it well like it was last night 
Maybe the night before 
Standing there sweating under the 40 watt light 
For a kiss at my Daddy’s door 
Every star blazed above and the moon was a yellow ball 
We were there trying to connect the dots 
And make a little sense of it all 
And his best friend was in the car 
Slumped down behind the wheel 
And the radio played the tune 
Well I loved that boy with all my might 
At least a month or so 
Then he ran off with the girl next door 
I had to let him go 
Nothing, I swear, could ever prepare me 
For the way I felt inside 
Like somebody kicked as hard as they could 
Part of me died 
(Chorus:) 
(And I dreamed of him every night 
I saw him each day at school 
And a voice deep inside kept saying, 
“Get back in the saddle! One more time! 
Get back in the saddle! Swallow all of your pride 
Cause if you can’t take the fall 
You shouldn’t take the ride 
Get back in the saddle! One more time!) 
Well it only takes one broken heart 
To learn what it’s all about 
Some you win, some you lose 
And if you’re lucky you get some get rained out 
But you got to keep on, keeping on 
Walking to the light 
Passing all the wrong ones up To get to the one that’s right 
(Repeat Chorus) Come on girl 
Don’t let him get you down 
Get on back in there 
Try and try again
