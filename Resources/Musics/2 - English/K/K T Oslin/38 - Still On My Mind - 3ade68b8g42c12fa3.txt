STILL ON MY MIND

My lips on the bottle 
My hands on the phone 
Well, I’m callin’ everybody 
Nobody’s home 
I found your number 
I wonder if it’s the same 
Hello, long distance 
Won’t you get me to that man again 
(Chorus:) 
Cause you’re still on my mind 
Still on my mind 
Oh I’m still missin’ pieces 
From this broken heart of mine 
Now don’t get me wrong here 
I don’t do this kind of thing every day 
I was just doin’ a little drinkin’ 
Doin’ a little thinkin’ 
And it brought you to my mind again 
I was feelin’ lonesome 
Feelin’ my wine 
Now I feel like I need to talk to someone 
From those good ole times 
(Repeat Chorus) 
Still on my mind 
Still on my mind 
I’m still missin’ pieces 
From this broken heart of mine 
This broken heart of mine 
This broken heart of mine
