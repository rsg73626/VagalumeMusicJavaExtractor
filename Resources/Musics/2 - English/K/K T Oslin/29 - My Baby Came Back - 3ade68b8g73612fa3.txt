MY BABY CAME BACK

My baby got tired of a new love. 
My baby came back to a true love. 
Now by heart is beating with ease. 
Now my kiss is able to please. 

My baby is loving me better. 
My baby is sweeter than ever. 
No more sleepless night alone. 
I’m so glad my sweetheart, my baby came back. 

Some lose their love and they never love again. 
I’m tasting love that I thought I’d never win. 
My heart was waiting to take the wrong track. 
I’m glad that I waited my baby came back. 

My baby 
My baby

My baby is sweeter than ever. 
No more sleepless night alone. 
I’m so glad I waited cause baby came back. 

My baby
