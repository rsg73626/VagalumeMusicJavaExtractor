SILVER TOUNGE AND GOLD PLATED LIES

I can still hear your footsteps in the hallway. 
I still hear your voice behind the door. 
Hear the crying of my heart as it beats at a time. 
As it Waits for the one it will never see no more.

(Chorus) 
(Why why why did you leave me 
I can’t keep the tears out of my eyes 
Why Why did you deceive me in love 
With your silver tongue and gold plated lies.) 

I remember the first time I saw you.
Your clothes were black as mine. 
When you talked me your talk, you made me wish you could be mine. 
But somehow I knew something was not right. 
(Chorus)

You know my friends, when they see me they all wonder. 
And I don’t know to tell them when they ask. 
There ain’t nothing to explain, you just found another flame. 
Our love is just a thing of the past. 
(Chorus) 

You had a silver tongue you had a gold plated lie. 
you had a silver tongue you had a gold plated lie. 
You had a silver tongue gold and plated lies. 
Silver tongue, gold plated lies.
