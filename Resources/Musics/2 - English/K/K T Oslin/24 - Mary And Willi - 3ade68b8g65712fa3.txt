MARY AND WILLI

This is the story of Mary and Willi 
Modern lovers who never met 
They’re both lookin’ for that perfect love 
Neither one’s found it yet 
Ya see Willie wants his women beautiful 
Or Willi don’t want em at all 
If Willi can’t have a beauty on his arm 
Willi stays home 
Willi drinks beer 
Willi watches ball 
That’s why willi ain’t got no woman 
Let’s see why Mary ain’t got no man 
Let’s’ a take a look a look at ole har workin’ Mary 
Got a little business it’s doin’ well 
Well, she says her workin’ life is heaven 
Her personal life is hell 
Maybe Mary is much to choosey 
And she might wind up alone 
If Mary can’t have Mister perfect on her arm 
Everyone else is wrong 
Mary Ain’t got no one to call her baby 
Willi ain’t got no shoulder to learn on 
Nothin’ ordinary 
Ever do for Willi and Mary 
That’s why Willi ain’t got no woman 
That’s why Mary ain’t go man
