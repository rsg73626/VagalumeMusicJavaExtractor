MOMMA WAS A DANCER

My little girl asked me 
Momma, tell me what’d ya do for fun 
When you were young 
Did you date a lot of boys 
Or did ya just date one 
How’d ya get your fun 
Did ua talk on the telephone 
With your best girlfriend 
Whenever things went wrong 
Tell me Momma 
How did you get your fun 
(Chorus:) 
(Well, I told her 
Honey, Momma was a dancer 
Your momma could really get up and move around the floor 
Your momma was a real good dancer 
Before your daddy came along 
That’s all your momma lived for) 
I was known as Nelda Jean Prudie 
I was a real Texas cutie 
I drove a Thunderbird 
I had a ponytail 
And every day after school 
Me and Jimmy McCool 
Would drive to Nat’s cafe 
Where we’d dance the day away 
And every Friday and Saturday night 
I’d go down to the gym 
And I’d dance all night 
That’s how your momma, Nelda Jean Prudie 
Had fun 
(Repeat Chorus) 
Before your daddy taught me ‘bout romance 
Well, I’d drive a thirty mile dirt road in the ‘bird 
Just to catch a dance 
That’s how your momma, Nelda Jean Prudie 
Had fun 
(Repeat Chorus) 
Talkin’ about your momma 
Wanted to do
