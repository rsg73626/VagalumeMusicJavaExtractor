HOLD WATCHA GOT

Hold watcha got I’m coming home baby.
Hold watch got I don’t mean maybe.
I’ve been thinking about you,
I’m on my way.
I’m gonna sell my house. 
I’m gonna wreck the car.
Stay home honey right where you are. 
Hold watcha got I’m coming home baby to stay. 

I changed my mind I have to see ya. 
Its a purdy good sign that I need ya. 
Thats why I can’t wait to get home. 
See yourself hold on tight. 
I’ll be there before daylight. 
Hold watcha got I’m coming home baby to stay. 
(Chorus) 

I’m back and I ain’t leaving. 
Been too long and a little too much grieving. 
Thats why I can’t wait to come home. 
We won’t fuss we won’t fight, 
This time things are gonna work out right. 
Hold watcha got I’m coming home baby to stay. 
(Repeat chorus 2 times) 
Gonna sell my house. 
Gonna wreck my car. 
Stay home honey if thats where you are. 
Hold watcha got I’m coming home baby to stay.
