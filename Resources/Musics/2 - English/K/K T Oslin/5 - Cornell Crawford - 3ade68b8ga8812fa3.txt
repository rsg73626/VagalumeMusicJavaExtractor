CORNELL CRAWFORD

[This is the first song I ever wrote 
I read it on a bathroom wall. 
It said, “I ain’t never gonna love nobody but Cornell Crawford.”] 
I ain’t never gonna love nobody but Cornell Crawford 
He’s the one who turns me on 
He’s gonna pick me up in his pick-up truck 
Take me down the road to have a little fun 
He’s got a pack of camels 
He’s got a quart of whiskey 
And it’s all wrapped up in a brown paper bag 
Aw, I ain’t never gonna love nobody but Cornell 
Crawfod I’d go to hell for Cornell 
I ain’t had much luck with gool old Chuck 
All he ever want to is go the movies 
Aw baby, he’s dumg and he’s dirty and he’s way over thirty 
Honey, I’m too pretty to wasted my time on him 
Aw but that Cornell is so smooth 
He knows what to do 
He knows how to make me feel good 
Oh and I know some day he’s gonna take me away 
And it will just be me and C.C. 
Ya’ll I ain’t never love nobody but who? 
Cornell Crawford 
He is the one who turns me on 
He’s gonna pick me up in his pick-up truck 
He’s gonna take me down the road to have a little fun 
He’s got a pack of camels 
He’s got that quart of whiskey 
And he’s got it all wrapped up nice in a brown paper bag 
Oh we’re gonna stop 
We’re gonna park 
We’re gonna get down to it in stark 
I ain’t never gonna love nobody but that man 
If I can 
I ain’t never gonna love nobody but that man
