DR., DR

Doctor, doctor, can you spare me a minute 
It’s confidential just between you and me 
Would you listen to my heart tell me how it’s holding up 
Am I strong enough to fall in love again 
(Chorus:) 
(Tell me doctor, how many times can a heart be broken
Before it refuses to mend again 
Will it give out suddenly with warning 
Tell me how many loves have I got left) 
I’ve been reading all about the miracles 
Something wears out you replace it with something brand new 
But knowing my history what would you prescribe for me 
Have I healed enough to try just one more time 
(Repeat chorus)
