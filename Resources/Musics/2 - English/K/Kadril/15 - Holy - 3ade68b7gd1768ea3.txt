HOLY

Silence sings a sweet phrase
Got you in my suitcase
I will take you everywhere I go

Sailing on a soft breeze
Breaking waves of memories
Telling tales that no one ever told

Holy was the night and heaven was the day 
I never learned to smile this way
Listen to the mermaids
Songs that make your heart break
I never learned to sing this way

Watch the steps I'm taking
See the stars you're making
I am not the air for you to breathe
Catch the moon he's falling
Hear the sun she's calling
They haven't got the answers that we need

Holy was the night and heaven was the day 
I never learned to smile this way
Listen to the mermaids
Songs that make your heart break
I never learned to sing this way

Catch the moon he's falling
Hear the sun she's calling
Telling tales that no one ever told

Silence sings its sweet phrase
Singing with the mermaids
I will take you everywhere I go
