FULL MOON FULL OF LOVE

Coyote, oh coyote 
can you tell me why
everytime the big moon shines 
you sit right down and cry
he says 'it's not because i'm sad 
that i sing all night long,
i'm looking for someone to love 
and this is my love song'

Oooooooooooooo, 
oh i go crazy when that
moooooooooooon shines above
Oooooooooooooo 
won't someone save me
from that full moon full of love

Baby, oh sweet baby 
can you explain this
everytime the big moon shines 
i finally get a kiss
you said it's just the moonbeams 
that make you do these things
well, i think that i'll just sit right here 
and let that coyote sing

OOOOOOOooooooooo 
oh i go crazy when that
Mooooooooooooon shines above
Ooooooooooooo 
won't someone save me
from that full moon full of love
