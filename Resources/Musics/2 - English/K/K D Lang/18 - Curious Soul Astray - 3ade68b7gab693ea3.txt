CURIOUS SOUL ASTRAY

As a child my dreams ran wild
Through fields of disobey
Wandering, wandering, 
Wanting it all
A curious soul astray

As a child my heart ran wild
Through fields of disobey
Loving and laughing 
And longing to fall
A curious soul astray

*I ran with a passionate story
I ran for the wisdom and glory
Away, away I ran
As a child my dreams ran wild
Through fields of disobey
Wandering, wandering,
Wanting it all
A curious soul astray

*Repeat

As a child my dreams ran wild
Through fields of disobey
Wandering, wandering,
Wanting it all
A curious soul astray
A curious soul astray
