SUMMERFLING

early morning mid july
anticipation's making me high
the smell of sunday in our hair
we ran on the beach with kennedy flair

sweet sweet burn of sun and summer wind
and u my friend, my new fun thing, my summer fling 
laugh oh how we would laugh at anything
and so pretend a neverending summer fling 

this uncommon kinda breeze
did with our hearts whatever it pleased
forsake the logic of perfect plans
a perfect moment slipped thru our hands

sweet sweet burn of sun and summer wind
and u my friend, my new fun thing, my summer fling 
laugh oh how we would laugh at anything
and so pretend a neverending summer fling 


strange the wind can change so quickly without a word of warning
rearrange our lives until they're torn in two

sweet sweet burn of sun and summer wind
and u my friend, my new fun thing, my summer fling 
laugh oh how we would laugh at anything
and so pretend a neverending summer fling
