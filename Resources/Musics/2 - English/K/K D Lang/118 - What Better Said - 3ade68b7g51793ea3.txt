WHAT BETTER SAID

tell me 
of the things you feel 
of the visions inside your head 
surely 

your symphony 
could be playing with me instead 
can't you see me standing here 
hoping for the depths of blindness 
for the world to see 

why this 
synthesis 
whenever you are near 
truth is 
delirious 

in love's great atmosphere 
can't you see us standing here 
just hoping for the depths of blindness 
for the world to see 

what better said 
what better heard 
melt my heart with just one word 

what better said 
what better heard 
say this love is so observed
