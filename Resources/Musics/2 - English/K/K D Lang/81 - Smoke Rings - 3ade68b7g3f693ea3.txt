SMOKE RINGS

Gene Gifford/Ned Washington 
Tell me where do they go 
These smoke rings i blow each night 
What do they do these circles of blue and white 
Why do they seem to picture a dream of love 
Why do they fade my phantom parade of love 

Puff puff puff puff your cares away 
Puff puff puff night and day 
Blow blow them through the air silky little rings 
Those little smoke rings I love take me above with you 

Puff puff puff puff your cares away 
Puff puff puff night and day 
Blow blow them through the air silky little rings 
Those little smoke rings I love please take me above 
Take me with you
