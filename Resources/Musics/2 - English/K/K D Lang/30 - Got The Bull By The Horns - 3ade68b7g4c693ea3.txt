GOT THE BULL BY THE HORNS

I love the brunettes, blonds
And the redheads, too
Love 'em since I don't know when
I love 'em all right down the line
And then I start all over again
I tart all over again

I got the bull by the horns
In a downhill drag
Things are better Than they ever have been
I missed a lot of lovin'
In my lifetime
But I'm never gonna do it again, no
Never gonna do it again


Well, as a kid in school
I guess I done pretty well
All hung around me then
But I acted shy
And I let 'em get away
But I'm never gonna do it again, no no
Never gonna do it again


Over this town
Tryin' to find the places you've been
And I missed your huggin'
On the first go around
But I'm never gonna go around again
Well, let's go round again
