FLAME OF THE UNINSPIRED

I've spent a lifetime carving out my fate
things i like, things i hate
my very nature is to criticize
and cut myself down to size

on the cusp of compromise
to living hell
i slipped and fell

i'm in the corner licking my wounds
love's come and gone all too soon
looking back upon my life as such
and the remedies, they cost too much

such a frail and fragile place
this egg and shell
upon my face

fueled by desire
wind as to fire
flame of the uninspired
