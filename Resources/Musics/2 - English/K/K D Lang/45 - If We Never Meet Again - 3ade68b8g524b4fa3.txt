IF WE NEVER MEET AGAIN

If we never meet again 
I'll have a rose to remember
The snows of December 
Will bring you back to me
If we never meet again
I'll fall asleep 
In the flowers
Dream of the hours 
We spent in ecstacy

The leaves in the fall 
Will wreak of the beauty 
I found in your eyes
The birds in the spring 
When they sing
Will tell me 
That love never dies

If we never meet again
As sure as heaven above you
Forever I'll love you 
If we never meet again

The leaves in the fall 
Will wreak of the beauty 
I found in your eyes
The birds in the spring 
When they sing
Will tell me 
That love never dies

If we never meet again
As sure as heaven above you
Forever I'll love you 
If we never meet again
