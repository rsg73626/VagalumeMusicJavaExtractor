HOOKED ON JUNK

G. Elgar 
Through garbage dumps 
He sought his game 
The things thrown out 
Were the things he gained 

Back alley waste 
And dirt from litter 
He collected it all 
And he ate it 
For dinner... dinner... dinner... 

Hooked on junk 
Hooked on junk 
Hooked on junk.. junk...junk...junk... junk 

Sally looked in disgust 
How could a man write such stuff 
What about real life 
What about the way things really are 

What a gross person she was 
Sally threw her head back 
She began to up...up...  
Upheave violently 
Her guts tore from the sickening chore 

Detecting something foul 
She cried out for more bowel 
"More bowel" she cried 
"More bowel!" 

She found her head  
Lying in a bowl of toilet collectibles.... 
Collectibles.... 
Collectibles... 

I could see she was sick 
So i called her lawyer and ordered some 

Hooked on junk 
Hooked on junk 
Hooked on junk.. junk...junk...junk... junk.
