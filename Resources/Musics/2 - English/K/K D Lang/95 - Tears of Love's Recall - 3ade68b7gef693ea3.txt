TEARS OF LOVE'S RECALL

(kd lang/Ben Mink)

Love
Thing of might and dread
Stays the saviour and poison to all
Of heart and head

Love 
Force of death and birth
Still lies naked when next to the truth
So spins the earth

The tears of love's recall
Like blood to chocolate fall
(And) love
The common salt of thirst
Runs like water and cuts through the lives
Of blessed and cursed

The tears of love's recall
Like blood to chocolate fall

The tears of love's recall
Like blood of chocolate fall
