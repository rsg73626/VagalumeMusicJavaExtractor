HAIN'T IT FUNNY?

Jane Siberry 
We made love last night 
Wasn't good wasn't bad 
Itimate strangers made me kinda sad 
Now when I woke up this morning 
Coffee wasn't on 
It slowly dawned on me that my baby is gone 
My baby's gone 

Guess I shoudln't be so shocked 
I guess I shouldn't be so surprised 
Guess i sorta noticed the sadness in your eyes 
All this time together 
And I still feel so alone 
Two of us together couldn't make this house a home 
My baby's gone 
My baby's gone 
Oh so long 

Umf maybe I'm a little bit relieved 
Maybe even a little bit glad 
Now that you're gone maybe I won't feel so sad 
So I'm packing your things and 
Leaving them outside and 
Neighbours can talk themselves up into a storm I'll survive 
My baby's gone 
My baby's gone 
Oh ... so long 

Did you forget something my love 
I see you're back outside 
Looking at your suitcases looking oh so surprised 
Hain't it funny 
One of life's little jokes 
Thought you'd gone for good 
But you'd only gone ... for smokes
