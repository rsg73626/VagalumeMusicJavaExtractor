NOWHERE TO STAND

k.d. lang 

as things start to surface 
tears come on down 
scars of childhood 
in a small town 

hurt she pushed inward 
starting to show 
now she'll do some talking 
but he'll never know 

tables have turned now 
with a child of her own 
but she's blind to the difference 
what's taught is that's known 

numbed by reaction 
stripped of the trust 
a young hheart is broken 
not aware that it's just 

a family tradition 
the strength of this land 
where what's right and wrong 
is the back of a hand 
turns girls into women 
a boy to a man 
but the rights of the children 
have nowhere to stand 

memories of children  
are written in stone 
some they get buried 
not to be shown 
still they do linger 
deep down inside 
like a seed that's been planted 
and won't be denied
