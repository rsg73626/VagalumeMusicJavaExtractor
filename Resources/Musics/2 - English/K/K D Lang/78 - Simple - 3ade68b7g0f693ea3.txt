SIMPLE

flawless light in a darkening air 
alone...and shining there 
love will not elude you 

love is simple 
i worship this tenacity 
and the beautiful struggle we're in 
love will not elude us 

love is simple 
be sure to know that 

all in love 
is ours 
and love, as a philosophy 
is simple 

i am calm in oblivion 
calm, as i ever have been 
love will not elude me 
love is simple 
be sure to know that 
all in love 
is ours... 
is ours... 

that all in love 
is ours 
and love, as philosophy 
is simple... 
and ours...
