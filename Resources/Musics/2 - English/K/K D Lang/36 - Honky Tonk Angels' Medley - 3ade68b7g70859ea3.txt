HONKY TONK ANGELS' MEDLEY

In the evenin', in the evenin'
baby, when the sun goes down
In the evenin', in the evenin'
baby, when the sun goes down
Ain't it lonesome, ain't it lonesome
When your baby can't be found

Well, now if you love your baby
And you treat him right
But he keeps on fussin' at you
Every day and night
He's gonna trifle on you

Oh come on in Miss Kitty

They'll do it every time
and when your baby starts to steppin'
Lord, you really lose your mind

Now if your baby's mean
Take a tip from me
Wanna lock him up at home
And throw away the key
He's gonna trifle on you
Trifle on you
They'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin'
Lord, you really lose your mind

Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why you keep a hauntin' me

Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
Seems somehow we never can agree

Where's my baby, where's my darlin'
Baby, where you been so long
Where's my baby, where's my darlin'
Baby, where you been so long
Drop the money in the jukebox
And play another honky tonky song

Yeah
Ain't that right, Loretta?
You got it, kid
