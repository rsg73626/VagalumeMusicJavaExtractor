ANGEL WITH A LARIAT

Angel, angel from the sky
Came right down to sit beside
This lonely achin' heart of mine
That now, folks, feels sublime
Now I'm a walkin', talkin'
And a spinnin'
i can't keep my face from grinnin'
Things are roarin', soarin'
Oh what a feelin'
And to think it's just beginnin'


Angel with a lariat
Carry me home sweet chariot
With you


Angel toss your rope around
Yank me up from the ground
Sound the trumpets, send a hue
Ascending angels through the blue


I feel emancipation
No, I don't worry
Set my bugaboos down to worry
There's no aggravation
There's no worry
For I have found a true love surely


Yeah
With you
Angel!
