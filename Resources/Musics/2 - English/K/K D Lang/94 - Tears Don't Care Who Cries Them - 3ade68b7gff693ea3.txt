TEARS DON'T CARE WHO CRIES THEM

Tears don't care who cries them
They don't care at all
Any time a heart starts breaking
They will fall and fall

Rich man, poor man, beggar
Tears can fill each eye
They don't care who cries them
You just cry, cry, cry


*Once my love and dreams
Were in your keeping
Then you walked away
With someone new
Once you laughed at me
When (While) I was weeping
What happened to me
Has happened to you
Tears don't care who cries them
But my eyes are dry
I'm laughing now while you learn how
To cry, cry, cry


(repeat *)
