SUNDAY

Sunday, Sunday
The one day, I revere

Sunday, Sunday
Let no one-interfere

Six days a week 
Waiting 
I spend waiting-to 
Be spending

Sunday, Sunday
Let no one-interfere

Six days a week, waiting
I spend waiting-to be 
Spending

Sunday afternoon
(Sunday afternoon)
Naked in your room
(Naked in your room)
Love is all consumed

Sunday, Sunday
Let no one-interfere
When the world disappears
Let the world disappear
Let the world disappear
