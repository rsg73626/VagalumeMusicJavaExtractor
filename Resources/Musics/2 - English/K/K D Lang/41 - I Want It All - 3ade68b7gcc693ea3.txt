I WANT IT ALL

all of your body
all of your mind
all your affection
all of the time

all of the comfort
all of the ache
all of the giving
all of the take

every ounce of you
and your love
oh, is all i need
strong and tender
i'll surrender
i am on my knees

all the illusion
all of the truth
all the confusion
all of the proof

all of the pleasures
all of the pain
all i am losing 
all that i gain

i want it all
i want it all
i'll take whatever you can give me
but i want it all
