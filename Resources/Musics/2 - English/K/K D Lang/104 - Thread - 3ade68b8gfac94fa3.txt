One says love is tragic
One says miracle
One becomes a skeptic 
One is vulnerable
It's sad to me how quickly 
We define 
What's wrong with yours 
Is right with mine
You think 
That we could learn 
To let things slide? 
Just let things slide

One side moving closer 
One is more obscure
One side feeling open 
One in overload
All the time it takes 
To build things up
And no time 
Flat to deconstruct
You think 
We could learn 
To give it up? 
Give it up

The thin ice that we tread 
That's dangerously set
The intentions 
Go falling through

And you 
I had you in my web
Now here I am instead 
Hanging by a thread

I'm caught up back and forth 
Of balancing my fear
I'll tell though you 
For all it's worth
I fell for you my dear

It's sad to me how quickly 
We define 
What is wrong with yours 
Is right with mine
You think 
That we could learn 
To let things slide? 
Let things slide

The thin ice that we tread 
That's dangerously trapped
The intentions 
Go falling through
And you 
I had you in my web
Now here I am instead 
Hanging by a thread
