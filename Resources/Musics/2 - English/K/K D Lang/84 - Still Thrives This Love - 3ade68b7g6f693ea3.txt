STILL THRIVES THIS LOVE

(kd lang/Ben Mink)


I often wonder
Is it so
All I am holding
Wants let go
How could I manage
I don't know

I often question
Is it so
Life's contradictions
Tend to grow
Spawning the choices
And the woe

But, still somehow thrives this love
Which I pray I'm worthy of
Still somehow thrives this love

I often wonder
Is it so
The lessons of patience
Are learned slow
And earnings of labour
May never show

But, still somehow thrives this love
Which I pray I'm worthy of 
Still somehow thrives this love
