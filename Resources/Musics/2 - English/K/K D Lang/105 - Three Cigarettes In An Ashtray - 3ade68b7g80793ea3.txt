THREE CIGARETTES IN AN ASHTRAY

Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and I in a small cafe
A stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes
In an ashtray


I watched her take him from me
Now his love is no longer my own
now they have gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette
Burn away
