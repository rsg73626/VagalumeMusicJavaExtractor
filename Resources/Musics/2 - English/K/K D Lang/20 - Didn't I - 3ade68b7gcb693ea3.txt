DIDN'T I

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 
when I spoke to you 
i spit it out with honest tongue now 
didn't i 
and all i got from you 
was this thread of hope that i hung to 
didn't i 
for all the times i could let go 
i dangled there to let you know now 
didn't i 
then i spoke to you 
and you took away what i clung to 
oh didn't i 
love you baby 
baby 
oh didn't i 
love you baby 
how long till i panic 
how long do i wait
