CALLING ALL ANGELS

Santa maria, santa teresa, santa anna, santa susannah
Santa cecilia, santa copelia, santa domenica, mary angelica
Frater achad, frater pietro, julianus, petronilla
Santa, santos, miroslaw, vladimir
And all the rest

A man is placed upon the steps, a baby cries
And high above the church bells start to ring
And as the heaviness the body oh the heaviness settles in
Somewhere you can hear a mother sing

Then it's one foot then the other as you step out onto the road
How much weight? how much weight?
Then it's how long? and how far?
And how many times before it's too late?

Calling all angels
Calling all angels
Walk me through this one
Don't leave me alone
Calling all angels
Calling all angels
We're cryin' and we're hurtin'
And we're not sure why...

And every day you gaze upon the sunset
With such love and intensity
It's almost...it's almost as if
If you could only crack the code
Then you'd finally understand what this all means

But if you could...do you think you would
Trade in all the pain and suffering?
Ah, but then you'd miss
The beauty of the light upon this earth
And the sweetness of the leaving

Calling all angels
Calling all angels
Walk me through this one
Don't leave me alone
Callin' all angels
Callin' all angels
We're tryin'
We're hopin'
We're hurtin'
We're lovin'
We're cryin'
We're callin'
'cause we're not sure how this goes
