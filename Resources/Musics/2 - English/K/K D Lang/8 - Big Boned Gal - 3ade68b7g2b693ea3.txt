BIG BONED GAL

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 

she was a big boned gal 
from southern alberta 
you just couldn't call her small 
and you can bet every saturday night 
she'd be heading for the legion hall 

put her blue dress on 
and she'd curl her hair 
oh she's been waiting all week 
and with a bounce in her step 
and a wiggle in her walk 
she'd be swinging down the street 

you could tell she was ready 
by the look in her eye 
as she slipped in through the crowd 
she walked with grace 
as she entered the place 
ya, the big boned gal was proud 

hey hey the big boned gal 
ain't no doubt hse's a natural 
shakin' and a'snakin' 
and a'breakin' up across the floor 
hey hey the big boned gal 
ain't no doubt she's a natural 
reelin' and a'rockin' 
and she's yelling out for more 
now people would come 
from miles around 
and gather there to dance 
but when the big boned gal came shufflin' in 
she'd hold them in a trance
