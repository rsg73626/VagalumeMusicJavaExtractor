ONLY LOVE

you know it's true 
there's not much you can do 
but just try and ride it through 

let love carry you 
only love 
can bring you down 

only love 
brings you back around 
take this advice... 

these words from the wise 
to know of love's sacrifice... 
is a truth of living life 

and only love 
can bring you down 
only love 
brings you back around 
with every drop of life inside us 

with every heart we've left behind us 
everywhere you'll find 
it's only love 
brings you back around
