SWEET LITTLE CHEROKEE

Sweet little Cherokee
We'll meet by the linden tree
There, beneath to 
Stars that shine
That's where 
I will make you mine

When campfires glow
I'll be dreamin' of you
When soft winds blow
They will say I love you

Be tender, heart for me
My sweet little Cherokee

Be tender, heart for me
My sweet little Cherokee
