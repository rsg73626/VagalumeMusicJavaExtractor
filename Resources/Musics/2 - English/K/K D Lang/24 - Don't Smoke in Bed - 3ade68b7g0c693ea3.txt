DON'T SMOKE IN BED

I left a note on the dresser
And my old wedding ring
These few goodbye words
How can I sing

Goodbye, old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said
Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring

Chorus:
Don't look for me 
I'll get ahead
Remember, darling
Don't smoke in bed

Repeat Chorus
