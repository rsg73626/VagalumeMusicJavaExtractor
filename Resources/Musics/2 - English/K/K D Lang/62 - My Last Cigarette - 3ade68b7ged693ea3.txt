MY LAST CIGARETTE

Boo Hewerdine/Gary Clark/Neill MacColl 
The room in the morning 
Watching the rain turn to snow 
But outside my window 
Sometimes the rain falls harder than you'll ever know 
Sometimes the things that you love in the night 
The morning will choose to forget 

I have a habit i have been trying to lose 
Everyone thinks that they know what they want 
Sometimes your drug chooses you 
There are some things that i've promised myself 
Things i haven't done yet 

It's my last cigarette 
This is my last cigarette 

Sometimes the people you love in the night 
The morning will choose to forget 

This is my last cigarette 
My last cigarette 
This is my last cigarette 
My last cigarette
