THERE YOU GO

E. Miller/ D. Haddock/ W.S. Stevenson 
There you go 
Walking away 
Each step you take 
Bring heartaches my way 
She's won your heart 
I've lost it someway 
The way I feel  
You're walking away 
If I hadn't cheated 
And I hadn't lied 
I'd be the one 
Walking by your side 
I love you still 
I guess that it shows 
The way I feel 
There you go 

If I hadn't cheated 
And I hadn't lied 
I'd be the one... I'd be the one 
Walking by your side 
I love you still 
I guess that it shows 
The way I feel 
There you go 
The way I feel 
There you go
