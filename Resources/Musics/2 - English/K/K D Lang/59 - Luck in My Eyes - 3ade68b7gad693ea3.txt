LUCK IN MY EYES

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 

i can feel a mountain rain 
that'll wash away 
and shine again 
empty my pockets 
that were weighing me down 
sift through my soul 
to see what's lost and found 
gonna walk away from trouble  
with my head held high 
then look closely you'll see 
luck in my eyes 

i can hear a howling wind 
that sweeps away 
the pain that's been  
take all my sorrow 
and i'll cast away 
the worries tomorrow 
that i had today 
gonna walk away from trouble 
with my head held high 
then look closely you'll see 
luck in my eyes 

all my troubles, all my troubles, gone 
with luck in my eyes 
all my worry's all my worry's, gone
