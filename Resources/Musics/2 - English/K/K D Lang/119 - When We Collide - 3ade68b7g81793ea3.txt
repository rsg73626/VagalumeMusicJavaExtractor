WHEN WE COLLIDE

remembering the wind 
kiss soft the evening's end 
I'm floating in a world of 
where I wanna be 
I've played it in my mind 
at least a million times 
rewinding to the world of 
where I wanne be 

when we collide 
a universe of stars fill our eyes 
when we collide 
like heaven has exploded inside 

suspended in mid-air 
blissfully aware 
I'm drifting in a world of 
where I wanna be 

there must be something wrong 
all gravity is gone 
now I'm flying in a world of 
where I wanna be 

as the sun 
has begun to rise 
I realize my pride 
all my fears 
fall like tears of joy 
whenever we collide
