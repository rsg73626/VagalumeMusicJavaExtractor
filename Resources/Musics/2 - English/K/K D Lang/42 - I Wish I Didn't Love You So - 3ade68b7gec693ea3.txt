I WISH I DIDN'T LOVE YOU SO

I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you
Should have ended long ago

I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss
Torture me as long as this


*I might be smiling by now
With some new tender friend
Smiling by now
With my heart on the mend
But when I try
Something in my heart says no
You're still there
I wish I didn't love you so


(repeat *)

I wish I didn't love you so
