ONCE IN A WHILE

In love comes waltzing in
And gives my head a spin
With the answers backing one
Whose world turns upside down
Shattering the ground
Other expectations

Love beyond reason 
Is a love so hard to find
And love that can season you 
Make your heart 
A one tract mind
I will make you happy baby
I will make you smile
I'll drive you crazy baby
Once, in awhile
Once, in awhile

(Ohhhhh)
Love beyond reason 
Is a love so hard to find
(Ohhhhh)
Love that can season you 
Make your heart 
A one tract mind
I will make you happy baby
I will make you smile
I will drive you crazy, baby
Once, in a while
Baby once, in a while
Once, in awhile
