BIG BIG LOVE

BIG BIG LOVE 
oh can't you feel my love a'growin
can't you feel it
ain't it showin
oh you must be knowin
i got a big big love
it's not the type to be concealing
it's the type to be revealing
oh, you must be feeling
i got a big big love
i think it's time we done some walkin
i think it's time we done some talkin
well there's a great big moon above
honey, i got a big big love
this is not infatuation
it's true love's sensation
it's not my imagination
i got a big big love
for you
it's time we done some walkin
i think it's time we done some talkin
well
there's a great big moon above honey
and i got a big big love
this is not infatuation
it's true love sensation
it's not my imagination
i got big big love
it's not the type to be concealing
it's the type to be revealing
oh you must be feeling
i got a big big love
i got a big big love
i got a big big love
i got a big big love for you
