UPSTREAM

Straight 
Onto the beatin' path
Phase down 
Into it's aftermath
Kills me 
To find myself 
Here at last

I blame it on 
My human side
I blame it on 
The other guy
I blame the stars 
On the boulevard

The perfect body 
The perfect smile
The perfect lover 
Impeccably in style
I use to be I'd 
Laugh it off
Now it's just 
This joke I got
A halo promises 
A sinner's dream
The punch line 
Is I always 
Swim upstream

I blame it on 
My human side
I blame it on 
The other guy
I use to be 
I'd laugh it off
Now it's just 
This joke I got
A halo promises 
A sinner's dream
The punch line 
Is I always 
Swim upstream
Upstream

I use to be 
I'd laugh it off
Now it's just 
This joke I got
A halo promises 
A sinner's dream
The punch line 
Is I always 
Swim upstream
Upstream
