THE RIGHT TO LOVE

My love and I ask little of the world
The right to sigh together in the rain
And walk with heads up in the sun
And share our joy and our pain

And yet they said that we were wrong
We hadn't the right to our love
That this love was shameful to see

And yet we treasured our love
And so we go our solitary way
Indifferent to the cold unfriendly stares
Indifferent to the whispered talk

We don't care at all
We have all we need
As long as we can be together

We find our consolation in each other's eyes
That sweet look of wonder
We know we have earned the right to love
We know that we have earned 
that precious right to love
