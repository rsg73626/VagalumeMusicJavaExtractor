YOU'RE OK

i am wrought with paranoia
for i have brought myself before you
nakedly awaiting you're ok
could i be that i annoy you
flaunting ways that i adore you
i have no control here either way

*i awake at night with it
and in spite of it
it unravels me
it's begun to frighten

**but i'm alright
if you're ok
