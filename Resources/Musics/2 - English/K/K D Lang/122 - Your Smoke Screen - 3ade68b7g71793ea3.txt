YOUR SMOKE SCREEN

David Barbe 
The medicine has taken you over 
Washing away any desire 
How does it feel at the end of the day 
When your energy's gone and it's slowly replaced 
By the numbing sensation 
Cleaning both sides of your brain 

I remember the stars in your eyes 
But even the bright stars will fade out sometimes 
Do you remember our very last kiss 
Are you aware that you're terribly missed 
Do you remember how to remember 

I should have seen through your smoke screen
