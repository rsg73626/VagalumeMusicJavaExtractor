TICKLED PINK

k.d. lang/G. Matthews/F. Scott/D. Bjarnason 
Knowing things that I do 
And showing myself to you 
My habit-forming, tradition-ignoring ways to you are fine 
Well I'm tickled pink to think  
That you're mine 

I dug up a missing link  
When I uncovered you 
My lonely days are now extinct 
With this evolution of you 
I'm tickled pink 
Seeing things that you do 
And being one of the few 
Whose habit-forming, tradition-ignoring ways to me are fine 
Well I'm tickled pink to think  
That you're mine 

A glance from you 
I'm on the brink of melting to the core 
As told to me by my instinct 
There's ecstasy galore in store  
I'm tickled pink 
Seeing things that you do 
And being one of the few 
Whose habit-forming, tradition-ignoring ways to me are fine 
Well I'm tickled pink 
To think 
That you are mine
