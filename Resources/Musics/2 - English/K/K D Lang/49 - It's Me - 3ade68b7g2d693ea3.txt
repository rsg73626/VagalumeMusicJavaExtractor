IT'S ME

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 
what you see on t.v. 
all them sparkles 
it ain't me 
i am givin' what i can 
what i can 

things that i may tell you 
honey, i ain't lyin' 
it ain't me 
all this talkin' is how i feel 
how i feel 

i'm not asking for the world 
i just wanna be an ordinary girl 
might not be all you want 
but it's all you get, it's me 

on them shiny pages 
all that hairdo 
it ain't me 
i am showing just what i am 
what i am
