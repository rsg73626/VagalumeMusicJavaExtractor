LOVE AFFAIR

skies without stars
all the nights without you
I watch the world
from a room without a view
for you left me
with so few memories
I could close my eyes
and cling to
just a fading photograph
I'd sometimes sink to

all those smiles unexplored
all the words left unsaid
we strung our dreams
on and all to slender thread
for you left me
with so few memories
I could close my eyes
and cling to 
just a half-remembered tune
I'd sometimes sing to

now I found what we lost
time was all all it cost
love's always there
knowing someday I would share
in a life-long love affair with you

love was always there
knowing someday I would share
in a life-long love affair with you
in a life-long love affair with you
