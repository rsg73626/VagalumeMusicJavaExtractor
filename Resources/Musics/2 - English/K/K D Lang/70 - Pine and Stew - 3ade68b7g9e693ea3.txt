PINE AND STEW

Let's settle down 
The world won't stop spinnin' round 
We'll get out of this mess- 
Wait and see. 
Wait and see is that what you'll do? 
you think I'm mental in anguish over you? 
Does the fact that we may die urge you to pine and stew? 
Do you think I'm mental in anguish for you? 
I can't lie beneath the sky 
concern of mine is you. 

(Tell me that your tan is via the sun.) 
Tell me that the plan won't hurt anyone. 

OOOOOh... 

We will get out of this mess 
wait and see 
Wait and see is that what you'll do 
you think I'm mentally anguished for you 
Does the fact that we may die urge you to pine and stew 
Do you think I'm mentally anguished over you? 
I can't lie beneath the sky 
concern of mine is you 
No, I can't lie beneath the sky  
concern of mine is you 
think I'm mental
