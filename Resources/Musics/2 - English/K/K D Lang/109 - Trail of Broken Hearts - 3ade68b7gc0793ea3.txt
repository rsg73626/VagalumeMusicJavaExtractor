TRAIL OF BROKEN HEARTS

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 

trail of broken hearts 
looking back at you 
now and from the start 
these words will travel true 
the godspeed of trust 
will settle the dust 
we've been passing through 
leaving just a part 
down the trail of broken hearts 

broken trail so long 
a long and tired past 
an emptiness has gone 
i've found this place at last 
and here will remain 
with only the aim 
of staying sure and fast 
leaving just a part 
down the trail of broken hearts
