HANKY PANKY

k.d. lang/G. Matthews 
When I wink at you with one of my eyes 
Mean to meet behind the barn in 5 
I'll be waiting with a sweet surprise 

Oooh...  

Folks might wonder where we've wandered to 
Might be doing things we aint' supposed to do 
I just wanna spend some time alone with you 

Oooh...  

Hanky Panky 
Hanky Panky 
Hanky Panky    2X 

Maybe tomorrow we can go for a ride 
In the country sitting side by side 
I've got some things that I'd like to confide 

Hanky Panky 
Hanky Panky  
Hanky Panky      3X
