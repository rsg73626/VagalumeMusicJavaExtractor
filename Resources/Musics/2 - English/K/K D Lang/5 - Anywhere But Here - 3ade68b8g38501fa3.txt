ANYWHERE BUT HERE

Anywhere But Here
K. D. Lang
Composição: Indisponível

All too often I set my life aside.
All Too often my dreams went sailing by.
A chance of freedom, a chance of fate, a chance I'll take.

Oh leave it all to disappear. I'm heading anywhere but here.

All too often the dreams I've dreamed have died.
And all too often I'm never satisfied.
A chance of freedom, a chance of fate, a chance I'll take.

Oh leave it all to disappear. I'm heading anywhere but here.
Because I want a life, a souvenir.
I'll find it anywhere but here.

(California is gonna be the place for me.)

Oh leave it all to disappear. I'm heading anywhere but here.
Because I want a life, a souvenir.
I'll find it anywhere but here.

I'll find it anywhere but here.
I'm heading anywhere but here
