IN PERFECT DREAMS

In perfect dreams 
Love has no extremes
All the world can be endlessly 
In perfect dreams
In perfect dreams 
You can fly it seems
Sailing nakedly,
Wavelessly in perfect dreams

Dream, have a rendezvous
A flame or two
Dream, and I promise you
It all rings true

In perfect dreams 
Life is so quite serene
You and I can be happily 
In perfect dreams

In perfect dreams 
Love has no extremes
All the world can be endlessly 
In perfect dreams
Dreams
