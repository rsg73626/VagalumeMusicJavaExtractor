STOP, LOOK AND LISTEN

Patsy Cline 
An old cool cat from way downtown 
He's been boppin all around 
This old world were living fast 
Afraid some day were gonna run outa gas 
If your'e travellin that way too 
I'l tell you folks what you better do 
You gotta 
Stop, look and listen 
Don't know what you're missing 
Stop, look and listen 
You might be missing kissin 
If you're travelling slow  
You'll go a long long way 

Well Farmer Jones he came to town 
Saw that boppin all around 
Learned to do it, there's no doubt 
Fraid some day he'll burn his motor out 
If you're travellin that way too 
I'll tell you folks what you better do 
You gotta 
Stop, look and listen 
Don't know what you're missin 
Stop, look listen 
You might be missing kissin 
If you're travelling slow  
You'll go a long long way 

First came the boogie, then the bunny hop 
Now the (rumble, samba) then the bop 
I don't know what's comin next 
This old world's in a terrible fix 
If you're travellin that way too 
I'l tell you folks what you better do 
You gotta 
Stop, look and listen 
Don't know what you're missin 
Stop, look listen 
You might be missing kissin 
If you're travelling slow  
You'll go a long long way 

I know a cool cat from way outta town 
He's been boppin all around 
This old world we're living fast 
Afraid some day were gonna run outa gas 
If you're travellin that way too 
I'll tell you folks what you better do 
You gotta 
Stop, look and listen 
You don't know what you're missin 
Stop, look listen 
You might be missing kissin 
If you're travelling slow  
You'll go a long long way
