HUSH SWEET LOVER

**Hush sweet love, hush
And gently hold me 
In your trust
Lay down your walls
Let me love you with lust
Hush sweet love, hush
And gently fold me 
In your touch
I beg of you hush, lover hush

*Fall sweet lover, fall
Fall, giving me all
All you can give
Lover please give me all

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently sway 
This waking crush
Soothe my desire
And my wanting you so

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently stay
Within our trust
I beg of you hush,lover hush

*Repeat

I'm willing to fall
I'll give you my all
All I can give
I'll give my all

** Repeat

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently fold me in your touch
I beg of you hush, lover
I beg of your hush, lover
I'm begging you hush, lover hush
