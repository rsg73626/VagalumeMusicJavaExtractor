LOVE IS LIKE A CIGARETTE

Kent/Jerome Jerome/Richard Byron 
What is love 
You called it heaven above 
Star that shine in the night 
A bird that sings in its flight 
A flower that blooms in the spring 
There's no such thing 

Love's like a cigarette 
You know you had my heart aglow 
Between your fingertips 
And just like a cigarette 
I never knew the thrill of life 
Until you touched my lips 
Then just like a cigarette 
Love seem to fade away and leave behind ashes of regret 
And with a flick of your fingertips 
It was easy for you to forget 
Coz love is like a cigarette 

Then just like a cigarette 
Love seem to fade away and leave behind ashes of regret 
And with a flick of your fingertips 
It was easy for you to forget 
Coz love is like a cigarette
