I'M DOWN TO MY LAST CIGARETTE

The coffee's all gone
And my eyes burn like fire
It's way past the hour
When most folks retire
You told me you'd call me
But you haven't yet
And I'm down to my last cigarette

I'm down to my last cigarette
For I know what made you forget
You're sill out there somewhere
With someone you met
And I'm down to my last cigarette


I can't leave this room
You might call while I'm gone
The minutes seem like hours
Its soon will be dawn
And on top of all
Of my tears and regrets
I'm down to my last cigarette


I'm down to my last cigarette
And I'm trying so hard to forget
But you're still out there somewhere
With someone you met
And I'm down to my last cigarette
Oh I'm down to my last cigarette
