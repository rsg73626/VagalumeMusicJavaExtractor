IT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU

everything i do 
deliberately for you 
everything i see 
i'm seeing differently 
from every point of view 
it's happening with you 

in this crazy 
world full of lemons 
baby... 
you're lemonade 

everywhere i go 
i'm going with the flow 
every turn i take 
becomes a piece of cake 
no matter what i do 
it's happening with you 

everything i say 
comes out a different way 
every sound i hear 
is music to my ears 
it's too good to be true 
it's happening with you
