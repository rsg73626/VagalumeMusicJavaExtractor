FALLEN

The leaves have lost hold of the branches as always
And leaves us with gold and win colored pathways
In the same way I've
The same way I've fallen for you

You opened your arms like a school door to summer days
And opened my heard to the rumors of a higher place
Now where was I
Baby I've fallen for you

Love is always on the go
It never stays in one place
Day by day it changes and it grows
But you always recognize its face

Day by day it changes and it grows
But you always recognize its face

The leaves have lost hold of the branches as always
And leaves us with gold and wine colored pathways
In the same way I've
The same way I've fallen for you

Like the star in the night
Baby I've fallen for you
