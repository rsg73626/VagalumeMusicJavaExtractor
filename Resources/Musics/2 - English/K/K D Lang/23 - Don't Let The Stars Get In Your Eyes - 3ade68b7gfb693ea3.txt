DON'T LET THE STARS GET IN YOUR EYES

*Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh keep your heart for me
For someday I'll return
And you know (see) you're the only one
I'll ever love

Too many nights, too many stars
Too many moons could change your mind
If I'm gone too long
Don't forget where you belong
when the stars come out
Remember you are mine


(repeat *)


Too many miles, too many days
Too many nights to be alone
Oh please keep your heart
While we're apart
Dont't linger in the moonlight
While I'm gone



(repeat *)
