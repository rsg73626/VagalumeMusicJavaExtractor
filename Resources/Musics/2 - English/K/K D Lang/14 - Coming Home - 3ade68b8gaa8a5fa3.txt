COMING HOME

Oh sweet sorrow
lets write the book tomorrow

for I caught a glimpse
been obsessed with it ever since

My eyes no longer weak amongst the clarity that you pronuonce in me

won, you have won
my illumination has begun

I am happily indifferent to the ones who have consistantly been wrong
and all that once confined us like minutiae at its finest now is gone

oh sweet sorrow
lets write the book tomorrow

My eyes no longer weak amongst the clarity that you pronuonce in me
I am happily indifferent to the ones who have consistantly been wrong
and all that once confined us like minutiae at its finest now is gone

and all that that lies before me like the asphalt lures me forward towards home
home
coming home
