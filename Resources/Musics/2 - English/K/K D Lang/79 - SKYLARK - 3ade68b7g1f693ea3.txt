SKYLARK

Skylark, have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring
where my heart can go a journeying
over the shadows and the rain
to a blossom covered lane?

And in your lonely flight
haven't you heard the music in the night,
wonderful music,
faint as a will o' the wisp, crazy as a loon,
sad as a gypsy serenading the moon.

Oh, skylark, I don't know if you can find these things
but my heart is riding on your wings.
So if you see them anywhere
won't you lead me there?

Oh, skylark, I don't know 
if you can find these things
but my heart is riding on your wings.
So if you see them anywhere
won't you lead me there?
