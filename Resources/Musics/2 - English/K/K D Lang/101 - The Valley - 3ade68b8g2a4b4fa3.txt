THE VALLEY

I live in the hills
You live in the valleys
And all that you know 
Are those blackbirds
You rise every morning
Wondering what in the world 
Will the world bring today
Will it bring you joy 
Or will it take it away
And every step
You take is guided by
The love of the light on the land 
And the blackbird's cry
You will walk in good company
The valley is dark
The burgeoning holding
The stillness obscured 
By their judging
You walk through the shadows
Uncertain and surely hurting
Deserted by the blackbirds 
And the staccato of the staff
And though you trust the light 
Towards which you wend your way
Sometimes you feel 
All that you wanted 
Has been taken away
You will walk in good company
I love the best of you
You love the best of me
Though it is not always easy
Lovely? lovely?
We will walk in good company
The shepherd upright and flowing
You see
