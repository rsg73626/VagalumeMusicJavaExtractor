WORLD OF LOVE

far from above
a soul watched in silence
she dreamed of love
and innocence

the soul thought "how odd
and rare this beauty
this creature of god
that lies before me"

the touch of the sun, was
caressing her skin
the realm of the reason
came from within
and so the world love
begins...

the warm scent of musk
came rising slowly
lavish and lush
divine and holy

the touch of the sun, was
caressing her skin
the realm of the reason
came from within
and so the world of love
begins...

this was a dance
smiling with desire
this was romance's 
burning fire

the touch of the sun, was
caressing her skin
the realm of the reason
came from within
and so the world of love
begins...
and so the world of love
begins...
