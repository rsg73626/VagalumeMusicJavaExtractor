SUDDENLY

so peculiar 
you're way too familiar 
oh and so hard to ignore 
but somehow it makes sense 
that this acquaintance 
keeps me coming back for more 

then suddenly 
you got me 
got me thinging i might have been here
before 

my only distraction is this attraction 
that i'm dying to explore 
suddenly i remember you with me 
truly you're someone 
worth waiting for
