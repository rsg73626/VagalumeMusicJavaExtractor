I CONFESS

I confess
I need you badly
Hold me in your arms
Love me madly

I confess
I'll be your daddy
Ask for anything
I'll do it gladly

Life without you only brought me heartache
I've had all the lonely I can take
Now I know the letting go was my mistake
I'll say it again and again and again

Ask for anything
I'll do it gladly
Hold me in your arms
And love me madly
