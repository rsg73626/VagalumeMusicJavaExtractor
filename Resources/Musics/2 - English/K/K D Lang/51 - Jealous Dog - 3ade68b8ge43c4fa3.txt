JEALOUS DOG

Once i turned the TV on
I saw the green grass 
On the lawn
I don't know why 
It struk me off
That li(k)fe 
Was perfect 
As a catalog
I guess 
I'm just 
A jealous dog

I walked 
Into a house of prayer
I didn't feel 
So welcome there
I was looking 
For the hand of god
When it struk me hard
I was hit by a frog
Oh, the mean mean mouth 
Of a jealous dog (2x)

I had a friend 
With a handsome trait 
When hes done 
With his dinner 
Hed lick his plate

It's a way of living 
That i applaud 
Like the message 
In this monologue
To never be 
A jealous dog

Never be 
A jealous dog (2x)
