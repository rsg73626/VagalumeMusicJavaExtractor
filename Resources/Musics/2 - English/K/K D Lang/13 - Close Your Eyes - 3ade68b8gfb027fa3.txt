CLOSE YOUR EYES

If I were near you 
Would you feel me there?
Could you feel me 
Moving softly 
Through the air?
Lay me down 
And still your mind 
Say nothing, nothing
Now close your eyes

I will never leave
I'm a dream 
That answers to you

If I were near you 
Would you feel me there?
Say nothing, nothing 
Now close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes 
Close your eyes

I will never leave
I'm a dream 
That answers to you
Close your eyes 
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
(I will never leave)
Close your eyes
(I'm a dream 
that answers to you)
