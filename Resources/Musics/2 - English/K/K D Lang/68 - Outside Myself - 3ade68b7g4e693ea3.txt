OUTSIDE MYSELF

(kd lang/Ben Mink)


A thin ice
Covers my soul
My body's frozen and my heart is cold
And still
So much about me is raw
I search for a place to unthaw

Something in me
Broods love into fear
It veils my vision leaves my thoughts
unclear
My eyes

From blue turn to grey
Hoping to mask what they say

I've been outside myself for so long
Every feeling I had is close to gone
I've been outside myself for so long

I have been
In a storm of the sun
Basking, senseless to what I've become
A fool to worship just light
When after all, it follows night

I've been outside myself for so long
Every feeling I had is close to gone
I've been outside myself for so long

I've been outside myself for so long
Every feeling I had is close to gone
I've been outside myself for so long
