PULLIN' BACK THE REINS

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 
out of nowhere this gust of wind 
brushed my hair and kissed my skin 
i aimed to hold a bridled pace 
when with love itself i came face to face 

pullin' back the reins 
trying to remain 
tall in a saddle 
when all that we had well 
ran away 
with a will of its own 

i know your soul is wild and free 
like this galloiong inside me 
tossed by instinct and where we land 
is vast and certain of all that's planned 

you know, i learned to break the run 
and gently harness the love of someone 
yes, and equal parts of wait and trust 
is in control of the both of us
