UP TO ME

I feel frustration comin' back 
I'm not sure just where I'm at 
I'm losing touch w/ what I'm trying to be 
I need someone to show the way 
Not someone to share the blame 
Well it's not down to you 
It's up to me 

Don't wanna hang from someone's string  
Or answer someone else's ring 
The things I'm wanting most in life are free 
No, living hand-to-mouth's no treat 
Till bitter end the dream's still sweet 
It's not down to you 
It's up to me 

Well, it's up to me 
Lord it's up to me 
It's not down to you 
It's up to me     2X 

Well, I feel frustration coming back 
I'm not sure just where I'm at 
It seems the times and I just don't agree 
But I can stand on my own feet 
I won't quit until I'm beat 
Well it's not down to you 
It's up to me 

It's up to me 
Lord, it's up to me 
It's not down to you 
It's up to me
