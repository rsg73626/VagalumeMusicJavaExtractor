WASH ME CLEAN

You swim
Swim through my veins
Drown me
In your reign

My desire
Carries no shame
My will
Will harbour no pain

Wash
Wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreams

Drink
Drink from my spell
Quench
Love's drying well

Wash
Wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreams
