WALKIN' IN AND OUT OF YOUR ARMS

k.d. lang/Ben Mink 
problems find you, at least they try to 
sometimes too easy, just to teach me 
some things that i dare, others they don't care 
but still i know there's 

always somebody there to tell me 
'bout deep muddy water, why do they bother 
won't be roped and tied down 
no i can be found, comin' back 'round 
cause i know 

all your lovin', all your charms 
all the things that keep me calm 
time apart can do no harm 
walkin' in and out of your arms
