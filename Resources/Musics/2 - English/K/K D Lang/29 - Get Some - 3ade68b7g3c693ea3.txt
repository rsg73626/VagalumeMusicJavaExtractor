GET SOME

everyone, everyday
looking for some
along the way
sometimes you wonder why
it seems love just passes by
sometimes you wonder when
love will pass your way again

anytime, anywhere
you turn around
and love is there
someone with something new
right there in front of you
someone with the stuff
you can't get enough
of it

ã€€

love...
when love surrounds you

go on, get some
take all that you're given
go on, get some
get some of the love
that you're giving someone


love...
when love's around you
when love...
when love surrounds you

go on, get some
take all that you're given
go on, get some
get some of the love
you're given

just go on, get some
get some of the love
you're giving someone
