CURIOSITY

curious and bored 
stumbled through the door 
tripping over expectations 
she never knew before 

then, curiosity 
turns her gaze to me 
i think she caught me staring at her 
but i just had to see 

the beauty of desire 
is shamelessly inspired 
god, it's overwhelming me 

and basking in the sun 
seems dangerous and fun... 

god it's overwhelming 

curiosity... 
curiosity... 
curiosity... 
is killing me 

this infatuation 
is getting out of hand 
in this kind of situation 
one needs discipline
