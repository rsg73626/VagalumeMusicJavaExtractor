EXTRAORDINARY THING

laboriel jr./lang 

my ordinary days 
are spent inside the maze 
of never changing ways 

such ordinary days 
my ordinary spin 
showed itself again 

it never seemes to end 

then you came waltzing in 
waltzing in 
i'm falling... 
i'm falling in 
i never knew 
the likes of you 

extraordinary thing 
i do believe 
you are indeed, an extraordinary thing 
my ordinary game 
predictable and plain 
has never been the same 
since you came waltzing 
waltzing in 
i'm falling...
