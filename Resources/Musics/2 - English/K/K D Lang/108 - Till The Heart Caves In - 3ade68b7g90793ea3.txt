TILL THE HEART CAVES IN

T-Bone Burnett/Bob Neuwirth/Roy Orbison 
Stood together in an open field 
And share the secrets of the night reveal 
Then we chase the light 
Racing through the sky 

Can we untangle guilt and innocence 
How hard we torture this ambivalence 
Night will bring no dawn 
Where's the power gone 

For I'll steal your dreams while you are sleeping 
And sell them for dust and cheap lust 
And I'll turn your hope while you are weeping 
And cover your eyes with sad lies and dark skies 

Come closer to me on your hands and knees 
Alone when your will's gone 
How much is not enough how much is through 
How long will I be getting over you 
How much grief and sin 
Till the heart caves in 
Till the heart caves in 
Till the heart caves in
