LOVE'S GREAT OCEAN

love's great ocean 
came crashing down on me 
overflowing with 
possibility on me 

pull me under 
eternal wave 
pull me under 
i promise i'll behave 

love's great ocean 
come sweeping over me 
with this notion of 
positivity on me 

here in the ocean 
the ocean of deep blue dreams 
i'm dreaming of you 
here is the ocean 
the ocean i'm longing to be 
streaming into
