SHADOW AND THE FRAME

So I find myself and what I became
Having nowhere else to lay the blame
The darker side of me in my discovery
The shadow and the frame 
Are indeed the same

Does the taste for truth disappear with you?
Are my efforts all but wasted fruit?
The promise of my prime fading on the vine
But falling days indeed the seeds of time

And so we're losing this life we live
[Incomprehensible] but beautiful

The promise of my prime fading on the vine
But falling days indeed are the seeds of time
So I find myself and what I became
Having nowhere else to lay the blame

The shadow and the frame perfectly remain
The shadow and the frame are indeed the same
