SO IT SHALL BE

(kd lang/Greg Penny)


Shadows
Now curtain the moon
But faith swears
It will shine again soon
Shine with love 
You've been hiding from me

Your kiss
Has hindered the day
A longing
That won't go away 
You just keep knocking
And waking my heart
Like daylight chasing the dark

I can exist being caught by your kiss
Willingly
Or grant you control
Of my body and soul
Ask it and so it shall be

Shadows
Now curtain the moon
Still faith swears
It will shine again soon
Shine with love
You've been hiding from me
With that love
You've been hiding from me

I can exist being caught by your kiss
Willingly
Or grant you control
Of my body and soul
Ask it and so it shall be
Ask it and so it shall be
