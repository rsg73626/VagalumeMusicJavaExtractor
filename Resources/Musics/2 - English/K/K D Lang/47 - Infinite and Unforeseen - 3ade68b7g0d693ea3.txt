INFINITE AND UNFORESEEN

after
always
love becomes
a dream
infinite and unforeseen 

it takes you by surprise
there, before your eyes
a place you've always been
a place you've always been 

it takes you by surprise
there, before your eyes
a place you've always been
a place you've always been
infinite and unforeseen
infinite and unforeseen
