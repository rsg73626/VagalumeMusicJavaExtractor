SMOKE DREAMS

Smoke dreams
From smoke rings
While a cigarette burns
I keep yearning for you
Through smoke dreams
From smoke rings
That old feeling returns
Can't believe that we're through
I try to pretend
Our love has ended
But my heart tells me no
The dreams I resist
Won't be dismissed
Though I try to forget
With each cigarette
Still smoke rings
Bring smoke dreams
And although you are gone
Our love story goes on
