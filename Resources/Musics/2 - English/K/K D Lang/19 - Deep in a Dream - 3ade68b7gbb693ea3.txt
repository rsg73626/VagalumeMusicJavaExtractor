DEEP IN A DREAM

I dim all the lights
And I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette
Climbs through the air
The walls in my room
Fade away in a gloom
And I'm deep in a dream of you

Smoke makes a stairway
For you to descend
You come to my arms
May this bliss never end
We'll love and move
Just like we used to do
And I'm deep in a dream of you

And from the ceiling 
Sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lover's refrain
You're so appealing
And I'm soon revealing
My love for you over again

A cigarette burns me I wake with a start
My hand doesn't hurt but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep every memory I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you
