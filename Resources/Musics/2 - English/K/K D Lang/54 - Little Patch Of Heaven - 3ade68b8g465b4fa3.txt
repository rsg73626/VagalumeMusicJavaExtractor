LITTLE PATCH OF HEAVEN

I know a place
Pretty as pie
Out where the riverbend
Hits up 
With the end of the sky
It's left of Nebraska
And over a crest
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

Ev'rything's green
Know what I mean?
Darlin' it's quite 
The sweetest sight
Thatcha ever done seen
Ain't nothin' much out there
Just life at its best
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west

Bees by the dozen
Are buzzin'
Real peaceful
Ev'ry bluebonnet
Doggone it
Smells nice
Even 
The tumblin' tumbleweed
Slows down 
To match ter speed
On my tiny half-an-acre
Of paradise

Ev'ry which way
Buttercups sway
Out on the hill 
The daffodills
Are enjoyin' the day
What could be better
Than settin' to rest
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west?

Hummin' birds flutter
In utter
Contentment
Ev'ry dark daisy
Feels lazy
You bet
Even the skeeters 
An' the fleas
Say "May,I, "thanks"
And "Please"
Why, it's just 
As close to perfect
As you can get

Darlin', I swear
Once you been there
There aint a view
Beneath the blue
That could ever compare
The only thing missin'
Is you as my guest
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west

Why don'tcha come visit?
There's room in my nest
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west
