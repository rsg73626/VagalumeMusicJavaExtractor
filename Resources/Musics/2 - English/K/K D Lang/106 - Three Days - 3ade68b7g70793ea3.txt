THREE DAYS

willie nelson/faron young 
 three days that i hate to see arrive  
 three days that i hate to be alive 
 three days filled with tears and sorrow 
 yesterday, today, and tomorrow 

 there are three days i know I will be blue 
 three days i'll dream of you 
 and it does no good to wish these days to end 
 `cause the same three days start over again 

 three days that i dread to see arrive 
 three days that i hate to be alive 
 three days filled with tears and sorrow 
 yesterday, today, and tomorrow
