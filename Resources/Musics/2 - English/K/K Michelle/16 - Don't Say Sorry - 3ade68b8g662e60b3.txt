DON'T SAY SORRY

So you finally told the truth, well that don't impress me
'cause I already knew and I was just waiting to see
how long you was gonna keep
looking me straight in my face and telling lies
when you should know k. Michelle better than that, tonight

so you gotta be kidding me, or maybe you're crazy
to think an apology could just erase everything
'cause I give you the best of me, you gave me zero
there ain't no room for me with your big ego
so this is far as we gonna go, 'cause I heard that word before

don't say sorry, just don't do it
don't say you love me, boy, I ain't stupid
'cause you ain't new to this, you ain't no beginner
you know that you should know better
don't say sorry

know look here, my five year old son, he knows the difference
between right and wrong, so what's your explanation?
you don't play with people's time like that
people's life like that, people's dreams like that
'cause all the precious time you can't give back

don't say sorry, just don't do it
don't say you love me, boy, I ain't stupid
'cause you ain't new to this, you ain't no beginner
you know that you should know better
don't say sorry

just 'cause you came at me confessing everything
that don't erase what you've done, so starring ain't enough
now you say that you won't do this again
but I won't forgive and forget, so I don't wanna hear it, babe

don't say sorry, just don't do it
don't say you love me, boy, I ain't stupid
'cause you ain't new to this, you ain't no beginner
you know that you should know better
don't say sorry

don't say sorry, don't say it, don't say it
don't say you love me, I'm not stupid
I don't wanna hear it loud
I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna hear it no more
don't say sorry, no, no
don't say sorry
