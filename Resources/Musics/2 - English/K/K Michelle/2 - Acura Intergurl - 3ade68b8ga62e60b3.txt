ACURA INTERGURL

The day is long, what the hell is wrong?
I still ain't blown up yet
and I hate this fucking music that they made me sing
they can have the deal back
'cause I won't understand
I'm so sorry to my fans, I hope you'll understand
but I have, I'm through, I don't
wanna be famous, I'm through
you can't tell me what to sing no more

now I'm living through the music
I'm the best, now time to prove it, hey
what you mean you don't believe in me?
'cause you never see me on the kbj
but wait 'till I date a rapper, media
take out before and after
that's when I'll be a star in your eyes

why I still do this shit? I don't know why
feel like a rolling stone rolled away from home
should I find a rich man, have his kids and sit at home?
no, I wanna sleep under stars with the clouds in my eyes
I wanna found me a man who'll love me for life
he'll love me for life

what do I do when all the liquor's gone?
'cause I will need to pour another
just to finish these songs
that I don't wanna sing
all renegate a long way from home
