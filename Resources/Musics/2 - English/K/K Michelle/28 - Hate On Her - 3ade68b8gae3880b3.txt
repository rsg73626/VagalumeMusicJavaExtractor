HATE ON HER

There's a smile without a home
There's a heart that can't beat no more
How could she be the one you want
When I'm giving you so much
In this house we made are own
You have torn it down enough
And for the moment I was strong
You let it all go

Now she's calling your phone
Rolling her eyes at me
Like I'm the one who did wrong
Tryna play my role

But I can't even hate on her
Cause I know you got no heart
I can't even hate on her
Cause I know how low you go
And you made it feel right
When you know you was wrong
So I can't even hate on her

See that moment it can't be erased
Memories that can't be replaced
How could you even look me in my face
Years ruined in one day
Oh girl she don't even know
That grown boys don't even grow
She will always give her all

So when she's calling my phone
Next time I'mma let her know
She can have you I'm gone
Man love can be so cold

But I can't even hate on her
Cause I know you got no heart
I can't even hate on her
Cause I know how low you go
And you made it feel right
When you know you was wrong
So I can't even hate on her

I've giving my everything
But you took it all from me
I hope she can be all you need
Cause I can't be it

I can't even hate on her
Cause I know you got no heart
I can't even hate on her
Cause I know how low you go
And you made it feel right
When you know you was wrong
So I can't even hate on her
I've giving my everything
But you took it all from me
