PAIN KILLA

[verse 1:]
what would you do
being in love with somebody
who ain't never gon' love you back
that's me right now
and how would you feel
taking any love that you can
tryna get your life back on track
that's me right now

[pre-hook:]
I've become the man who hurt me
I wouldn't know love
if it stood right in front of me
and you can't judge
it's just what I've been through
I don't really care
you're just something to do

[hook:]
yeen nothing but a pain killa
pain killa
ain't need for me to paint the picture
paint the picture
I was never really fucking withcha
fcking withcha
cause I needed me a pain killa
pain killa
and it can't even get no realer
get no realer
I get lonely so I'm fucking withcha
fucking withcha
but I don't really care

[verse 2:]
and how do you feel
you done broke a lot of hearts
and now I'm here
and karma finally got you back
there's a girl out there laughing
and I bet it's sucks
if you never called me again
I wouldn't cry I really wouldn't give a fuck
that's me right now

[pre-hook:]
but you can't run around setting fires
the smoke done clear I realized you a liar
cause I'm gon' hurt them for they hurt me
it's gon' take a grown ass man to repair me

[hook:]
yeen nothing but a pain killa

I was never really fucking withcha
fcking withcha
cause I needed me a pain killa
pain killa
and it can't even get no realer
get no realer
I get lonely so I'm fucking withcha

but I don't really care

[bridge:]
some men out here
will bring you way down
and when you need love
there no where around
and ain't nobody got time
I be popping bottles like you
got a team of bitches too
I'm out here reckless like you
