I JUST CAN'T DO THIS

Know I love you
And I care about you
But you keep hurting me and I keep forgiving you
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this

You say you love me but we don't make love
You say nothings changed yet I pull and you shove
I call your phone several times, you don't pick up
And I'm not just gon keep on blowing you up
(had enough of this)
I'm always pleasing you
(boy did you forget)
That I got needs too
But I'm so afraid to walk away from you
I don't know what you want me to do

Know I love you
And I care about you
But you keep hurting me and I keep forgiving you
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this
Don't wanna lose you
Need you in my life
But your not giving back,
Why the sacrifice
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this

Now I take your cursing
Your drinking and even flirting
Smile for the camera when I'm really hurting
Everyday you make me feel it for certain
No matter what I do it just ain't working
(I had enough of this)
I'm always pleasing you
(boy did you forget)
That I got needs too
I'm just so afraid to walk away from you
I don't wanna hurt you but it's what I must do

Know I love you
And I care about you
But you keep hurting me and I keep forgiving you
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this
Don't wanna lose you
Need you in my life
But your not giving back,
Why the sacrifice
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this

Say you used to be my sunshine in the midst of the rain
And you used to ease my mind when my heart was in pain
I was the hand and you were my glove
Tell me what did you do with the man that I loved
You used to make me feel that I can fly
Now all I wanna do is lay down and die

Know I love you
And I care about you
But you keep hurting me and I keep forgiving you
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this
Don't wanna lose you
Need you in my life
But your not giving back,
Why the sacrifice
I just can't do this
Boy I just can't do this

I can't
I won't
I can't
I won't
I can't
I won't
I can't
I won't
