THESE MEN

Oh, these men
They don't know nothing about love
One woman ain't never enough
What am I to do?

Oh, these men
They sho' be getting around
Wifing all of these hoes 'round town
But I can't play fool
They don't know nothin', 'bout nothin', 'bout love

Rolling and rocking, always lying
To be out here popping
He's just getting started
With no signs of ever stopping
Listen
Two baby mama's another one coming
One thing for sure, it's always something
But still I hang on cause I can't stand sleeping alone

You see these men
They don't know nothing about love
One woman ain't never enough
What am I to do?

You see, these men
Sho' do be messing around
Wifing all of these hoes 'round town
But I can't play fool
They don't know nothin', 'bout nothin', 'bout love

Pain, it's life
Oh, every time I try to find somebody to love me
I end up hurting
I tried Lance
I tried Bobby
I tried Memph (oh, his ass was sorry)
Then I tried Idris
(ha-ha, and he still can get it even though he ain't shit)
I, I, I, I
See you're always be here be with the shit
And I ain't having it
Why can't they act right?
Before they come in (oh) and ruining my life

You see these men
They don't know nothing about love
One woman ain't never enough
What am I to do? yeah

Oh, these men
They just be laying hoes down
Guess, I just done figured it out
It's nothing I can do
They don't know nothin', 'bout nothin', 'bout love

They always on Ig doing something, you know?
They tryna get with her, they tryna get with him, hell
You know cause at the end of the day
If it ain't gone go my way, I don't want to play no more
No more, no more
