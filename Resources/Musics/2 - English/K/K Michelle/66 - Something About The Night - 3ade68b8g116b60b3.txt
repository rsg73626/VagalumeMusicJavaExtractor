SOMETHING ABOUT THE NIGHT

Oh I wanna roll one up, pull my hair up
Got a full cup, don't give a fuck, oh no, oh no
Oh, it'll be too long cuz when you're gone and I get home
I need to get on you, on you
Is it your good looks or your lips below that make me blow
Is it the way you act like you don't care
When I'm the only one who kiss you there, ohh
You know it's true

Something about the night
Might let you come in
Just might let you come in
Something about the night
That keep me coming
That keep me coming

Oh, I got my butter cake all in your face
My ovens hot, just watch me bake
Good lord, ohh
Ohh and eat it up and lick the plate
You know you just can't have one taste, no
No, no, no, no

Is it your good looks or your lips below that make me blow
Is it the way you act like you don't care
When I'm the only one who kiss you there, ohh
Something about the night
Might let you come in
Just might let you come in
Something about the night
That keep me coming
That keep me coming

Something about the night
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Something about the night
It's a different kinda high, different kinda high
Something about the night
Might let you come in
Might let you come in

Something about the night
That keep me coming
That keep me coming
Something about tonight
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Something about the night
Different kinda high, different kinda high
