FALLIN'

Feels like I'm fallin fallin fallin
Feels like I'm broken broken broken
Sun don't even shine I dont wanna go outside
Feels like I'm dyin dyin dyin

Can't believe that it's over
See I been cryin like 5 days straight and
I want this hurt to be over
Yea my girls be sayin the same old things

Sayin it's gonna be okay, alright but when's okay coming
Girl you dont need him, but their not the one that loved him
They don't know this pain, never felt the same
So let me explain

Feels like I'm fallin
I'm fallin and I can't get up (I've fallin and I can't get up)
Feels like I'm broken
And your not here to fix me up (And your not here to fix me up)
Feels like the sun don't even shine no more,
I dont wanna go outside no more
Ever since my sunshine been gone
Feels like I'm dying, dying to be back in your arms
That's what it feels like baby

All this time that we puttin in
See I dont wanna have to start all over
How I act like you dont exist
When there's portraits of your face all over

Every where I look I'm seein something
That reminds me of you
I do yea
I think my mind is playin games
Tell me if you feel the same
Baby let me explain

Feels like I'm fallin
I'm fallin and I can't get up (I've fallin and I can't get up)
Feels like I'm broken
And your not here to fix me up (And your not here to fix me up)
Feels like the sun don't even shine no more,
I dont wanna go outside no more
Now that your gone
Feels like I'm dying, dying to be back in your arms
That's what it feels like baby

I'm so torn inside
I just want you back here by my side
Cause you are the only thing thats real in my life
Boy I need you back with me
Ooo so tell me whats it gonna be

Feels like I'm fallin
I'm fallin and I can't get up (I've fallin and I can't get up)
Feels like I'm broken
And your not here to fix me up (And your not here to fix me up)
Feels like the sun don't even shine no more,
I dont wanna go outside no more
Feels like I'm dying, dying to be back in your arms
That's what it feels like baby
