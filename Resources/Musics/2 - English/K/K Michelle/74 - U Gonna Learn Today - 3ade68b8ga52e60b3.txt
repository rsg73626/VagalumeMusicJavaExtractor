U GONNA LEARN TODAY

Well since y'all here with me today, (k. Michelle)
I might as well keep it one hundred now
they say I drink too much, curse too much
I can be a little rough, but in God I trust
hypocrites so quick to judge
I'm loving all my fans, y'all be showing me love

he say this, she saying more
yeah, I was a stripper, but I ain't no whore
don't make me forget what I'm here for
keep your record deal, I don't want it no more
'cause you don't know what it's like to not kiss your son goodnight
I got my foot in my door, but everyday's a fight

if this record make you feel some type away
it might be a bullet shot out your way
'cause I'm a throw shade when I get paid
all I can say is you gonna learn today
hey, you gonna learn today
the dude behind the desk wasn't impressed
but no disrespect, they be cutting him checks
ooh, better watch what I say
record ex, throw you back, they don't play

I have been around the world, slept with some girls
smoked a little weed, but they don't define me
ooh, this is my life, who are you to
tell me what's wrong and what's right?
'cause you don't know what is like to not kiss your son goodnight
I got my foot in the door, but every day's a fight

if this record make you feel some type away
it might be a bullet shot out your way
'cause I'm a throw shade when I get paid
all I can say is you gonna learn today
hey, you gonna learn today
you know, people tend to talk the most
about things that they know the least about

my name's always in somebody's mouth
they like to talk a lot of shit about me
you know what I'm saying?
but I'm just grateful, I don't do it for them
I do it for the women, I do it for my family
and I do it for the love of the game and of music
know what I'm saying?

I think you all owe me some respect
I don't forget
more than you ever learn in all of your lifetime
you know what I'm saying?
so if you wanna know about me
you come see me and ask about me
so if you ain't know now you know
and for all y'all that keep throwing that hate
you can just kiss my ass
