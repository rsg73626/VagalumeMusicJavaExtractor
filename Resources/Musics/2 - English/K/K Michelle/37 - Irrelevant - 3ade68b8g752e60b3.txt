IRRELEVANT

I heard you have a thing for the big booty chicks
out trickin in the club at night
long as you held me down, won't even gonna trip
long as you kept me satisfied
all you have to do is keep it at a distance
let 'em know that I was your girl
all your dirt should have never had to witness
it's such a shame that you gave up on this good thing

see, love, it comes and goes, I just had to learn the hard way
ain't even mad at you, see I didn't peep game
'cause your love is so irrelevant, now that I found somebody else
your love's so irrelevant, so you can keep it to yourself
I don't need your love no more
so neglectful, disrespectful, how you used
to love me like you didn't want me
treat me like I'm your number two, three, four, five, six
I expected way more, 'til you hit my best friend

all you have to do is keep it at a distance
let 'em know that I want you
all your dirt should have never had to witness
it's such a shame that you gave up on this good thing
see, love, it comes and goes, I just had to learn the hard way
ain't even mad at you, see I didn't peep game
'cause your love is so irrelevant, now that I found somebody else
your love's so irrelevant, so you can keep it to yourself
I don't need your love no more
