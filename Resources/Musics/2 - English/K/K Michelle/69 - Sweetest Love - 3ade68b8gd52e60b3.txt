SWEETEST LOVE

Listen
lying here in my bed, I can feel the sweet caress
I can't wait for what comes next
hair messed up, I'm soaking wet
I'm filled all up from this sweet love
it's been 3 rounds, but we can't stop now
the greatest sex is going down
and it's your turn, I'm going down, down

cause I just wanna please you, hey
anything you ask I'm a do what I gotta do
it's all for you, yeah
so bend me over and turn me around
let's perform like we got a crowd
take control cause you the man
and I'll be screaming like I'm your fan

then I woke up, I realized it was
my own hand between my thighs
but no one was here
I know it's weird, guess I don't need no help
I just made the sweetest love to myself
I just made the sweetest love to myself

I'm confused what just went down
he was all in me but he ain't around
sitting here trying to figure out
who the hell has been in my house
can't be a dream cause it feels so real
can't explain how it made me feel
my clothes on the floor, I woke up wanting more, mm
am I crazy, I don't think ya'll hear me
all I know is tonight I had the greatest sex of my life

then I woke up, I realized it was my own
hand between my thighs
but no one was here
I know it's weird, guess I don't need no help
I just made the sweetest love to myself
I just made the sweetest love to myself
then I woke up, I realized it was
my own hand between my thighs
but no one was here

I know it's weird, guess I don't need no help
I just made the sweetest love to myself
I just made the sweetest love to myself
love my, no hands, no hands, no hands
I just made the sweetest love to myself, who, oh
I just made the sweetest love to myself
I just made the sweetest love to myself
I just made the sweetest love to myself
