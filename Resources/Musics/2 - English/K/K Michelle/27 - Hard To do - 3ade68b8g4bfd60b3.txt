HARD TO DO

I've been thinking bout ya
are you thinking bout me?
I know I went crazy
but you were wrong

I apologize, I'll let it go tonight
forgive me and I'll forgive you

[hook:]
cause what you gon' do
when I put that pretty thing on you
I usually don't do this
but I'll do it for you

[chorus:]
oh, baby cause
missing you is way too hard to do
I'd rather be fucking you
do you mind if I give you love
cause I just wanna give you love
won't you tell me if I'm doing too much
missing you is way too hard to do

lately I've been in my feelings
dealing with the daily thoughts of missing you
I ain't dialing but my body's calling for ya
breaking down
gotta give it to you

[hook]

[chorus]

[rap:]
don't get along all the time
just want your body on mine
and you can call it what you wanna
but I'm a call you when I want it
fishnets and trench coats
underneath, it's a bomb
american's most wanted
errbody upon on it
