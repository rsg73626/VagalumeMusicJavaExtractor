WHATEVER

Whatever
burning eyes
unanswered wise
a year ago today
he left me in my bed to die
I think about it sometimes
I can't even cry
ain't bitter
just ready to try
haven't seen his face
but I love him so much
close my eyes
I can feel his touch
don't know a lot about the future
but I know I'm ready to love

so I'm grateful
for every break in my heart
every time he tore me apart
the cheating
all of the lies
but now I'm ready
where ever you are
where ever you are
where ever you are
the cheating
all of the lies
but now I'm ready
where ever you are

what a change
in me today
I wear the scar
but I'm ok
I've come a long long wa-ay
but honestly I must say
I need love like everybody
what makes me different
cause I dream of holding hands
and making wedding plans
may sound a little bit crazy
cause once you've seen
the other side
you deserve a perfect life
I know he's out there for me

so I'm grateful
for every break in my heart
every time he tore me apart
the cheating
all of his lies
but now I'm ready
where ever you are
where ever you are
where ever you are
the cheating
all of the lies
but now I'm ready
where ever you are

where ever
you ooh are
where ever
you ooh ooh are
oh oh oh oh agh ah

so I'm grateful
for every break in my heart
every time he tore me apart
the cheating
all of the lies
but now I'm ready
where ever you are
all of the cheating
all of the lies
but now I'm ready
where ever you are
