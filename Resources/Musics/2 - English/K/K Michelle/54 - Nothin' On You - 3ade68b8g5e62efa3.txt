NOTHIN' ON YOU

Beautiful girls all over the world
I know you're in pain, it's all a part of love's game
'cause he don't deserve you baby
He don't deserve you baby

It's alright to cry but hurry up dry your eyes
He's only one man don't let him ruin your life
I know he left you lonely
But he don't deserve you baby

Hot damn doe, here we go again,
Here’s another lesson that I’m teaching by some man,
He told you that he love you, now he’s sleeping with your friend,
And now you’re crying rivers like your worlds gonna end,
But baby girl, it’s just the beginning,
Use your mind, not your body and you two could be a winning,
I used to be hurt, but men I got plenty they don't act right I throw them out like frisbees for most these niggas ain't shit it took all my life, but now I realize it; they do what they wanna do, they get what they get, hit when they hit, then they split when they split.

Get over it, and get on yo shit, it ain't that cruisol you can find some new dick cause most of these man is groupies they want a chick cause she on b.e.t.
