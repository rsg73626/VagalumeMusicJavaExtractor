A MOTHER'S PRAYER

Oohh, oohh, oohh

Last night I prayed on a fallen star that you never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold, just remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what people say
Even when it hurts it'll be ok

Tomorrow brings new promise so don't worry 'bout today
The first time I saw you I knew my life had changed
I would've been dead & gone but I found purpose when I brought you home
And even though I'm not there to tuck you in everyday
I'm not far away
This is what a mother prays

Last night I prayed on a fallen star that you never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold, please remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what the people say
In your darkest hours I'll help guide your way

Those dreams you have I want you to chase 'em (chase 'em)
These bond we got, let nobody break it (break it)
And when I'm on the road & I can't see your face
This music will never take your place
I love you chase (I love my chase)

And that's why last night I prayed on a fallen star that you never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold, please remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what the people say
Even when it hurts it'll be ok
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what the people say
In your darkest hours I'll help guide your way

This is what a mother prays

Your daddy loves you & I love you too
Sorry we couldn't work it out
We gon' do what's best for you
I pray ohh I pray
I love you
This is what a mother prays
