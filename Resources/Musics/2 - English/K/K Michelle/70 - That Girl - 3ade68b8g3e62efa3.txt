THAT GIRL

Sticks nor stones wont break my bones
Words only encourage me
Only you can stop the rain
Overcame the pain
And ain't nobody stopping me
When I young, I always knew
There was something in my life I was destined to do
I knew I would be the best that I could be
Fill my life with positivity no negativity
I said

Mama (yeah) ima be a star
Mama (yeah) ima work hard
Mama (yeah) ima go far
She said you can do anything baby just follow your heart
I know

I'm gonna be that girl
I'm gonna be that girl

Through tribulations I kept my dedication
I know I can make it
That's the test that I be facing
Pick up the pieces
Reach down inside
Swallow my pride and put jealousy aside
I said

Mama (yeah) ima be a star
Mama (yeah) ima work hard
Mama (yeah) ima go far
She said you can do anything baby just follow your heart
I know

I'm gonna be that girl
I'm gonna be that girl

That girl.
That girl, that girl (I'm going to be that girl) that girl, that girl, that girl
And they say I couldn't do it, I gotta prove it that girl
That girl, that girl, I'm going to be that girl, that girl
That girl hey I'm going to be that girl.....
