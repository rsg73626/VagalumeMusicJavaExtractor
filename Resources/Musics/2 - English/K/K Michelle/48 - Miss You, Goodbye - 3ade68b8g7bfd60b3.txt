MISS YOU, GOODBYE

I miss you in the day
I miss you in the night
I miss the way we used to talk
but I don't miss your lies

I miss the way we laughed
you used to make me smile
maybe you'll see
what we can be
and then you'll come around

I needed love
I wasn't enough
you can't say I didn't try
it might make me cry
it's gon' hurt, no lie
miss you, but goodbye

I wish that you could change
but I don't think you can
I wish that you could feel this pain
so you could understand

I hate you're not the one
I hate you're moving on
cause my bed it was made for two
but I sleep here alone

I needed love
I wasn't enough
you can't say I didn't try
it might make me cry
it's gon' hurt, no lie
miss you, but goodbye

and I hold on to the night
and I pick up when I'm down
but I won't argue

if there's any hope
my head says
let it go
my heart says: Fight for, fight for your love
but I'm giving up

I needed love
I wasn't enough
you can't say I didn't try
it might make me cry
it's gon' hurt, no lie
miss you, but goodbye
