PILLOW

My heart's been broken more times than I can count
I wish I could love, but I don't wanna be let down
'cause nobody wants to be lonely
I know there's a man out there for me
he'll turn my dark nights to beautiful mornings
that's not too much, that's all that I'm wanting

it's just another day alone, just me and my pillow
nobody to tell me "good morning" or "have a good day"
it's just sheets here
it's just another day alone, don't wanna wake up alone
it's cold in my bed, just me and my pillow
why my girls' the brides and I'm always they bride maid

and why I always catch the bouquet
but never seem to see the day?
'cause I ain't trying to be out here lonely
I need a good man to hold me, he can fill this space in my bed
somewhere to lay his head
that's not too much, that's all that I'm wanting
it's just another day alone, just me and my pillow

nobody to tell me "good morning" or "have a good day"
it's just sheets here
it's just another day alone, don't wanna wake up alone
it's cold in my bed, just me and my pillow
I don't think y'all hear me, I just wanna be loved
so tell me what's wrong with not wanting to be alone

I need you, I need you, I need you
come home to me
you can fill this space in my bed, come here and lay your head
that's not too much, that's all that I'm wanting
it's just another day alone, just me and my pillow
nobody to tell me "good morning" or "have a good day"
is just sheets here
it's just another day alone, don't wanna wake up alone
it's cold in my bed, just me and my pillow
