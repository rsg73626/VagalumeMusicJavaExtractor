GOING UNDER

My left side feels so heavy
Failing steady
It's like my heart is giving out
How come I'm
So hardheaded, so forgiving
Forgetting how you bring me down

Who's gonna pick me up?
Who's gonna give a fuck?
Who's gonna go the mile?
Fly me to the clouds?

I'm telling love, don't fail me now, don't count me out
OOh love, don't let me down, come back around
Hey, it's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under

My vision, so misleading, make believe in
In things I never saw
Deep inside, when I ride I know
Things got different
Oh, it's not what we thought, oh

Who's gonna pick me up?
Who's gonna give a fuck?
Who's gonna go the mile?
Fly me to the clouds?

I'm telling love, don't fail me now, don't count me out
OOh love, don't let me down, come back around
Hey, it's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under

Every day it's a fight
Sinking fast, going down
I just wanna get back right
So I need you out of my life

I'm telling love, don't fail me now, don't count me out
OOh love, don't let me down, come back around
Hey, it's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the jungles in time that make me wonder how I keep going under
