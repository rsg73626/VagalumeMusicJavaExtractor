HOW MANY TIMES

If you were hurt like I was before
Ladies go turn up your radio
Cause I'm gonna sing this one for us yeah
See they complain about our attitude
Talk about the things we do
To me it seems so obvious
They like it they keep coming back keep coming back
For more

you're always so quick to up and criticize
I got my flaws and yes I realize
I've become so hard to deal with
'cause this point of my heart is so tired

[chorus]
How many times, how many times, how many times
I caught you on the phone with her
How many times, how many times, how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Oh this song knows how I feel
You betrayed my love
And the moral of the story is
How many times how many times
Our sister our sister mary real love
she used to tell us about this in the 90's
I used to say that'll never be no never never me
But it's 2011 and I feel I can't get any lower
Taking out my anger out on any
and everybody that comes around me
I've become so hard to deal with
'cause this point of my heart is so tired
How many times how many times how many times oohh
I caught you on the phone with her

How many times how many times how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Oh this song knows how I feel
You betrayed my love
And the moral of the story is
How many times how many times how
How many times must I cry and how
Many times should my son see my tears
(only 7 years old)
How many of ya'll goin through the same thing
I've become so hard to deal with
'cause this point of my heart is so tired

[chorus]
How many times, how many times, how many times
I caught you on the phone with her
How many times, how many times, how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Oh this song knows how I feel
You betrayed my love
And the moral of the story is
How many times how many times
How many times do I gotta get hurt to know
It ain't never gonna get no better
How many times ladies have you been hurt
And you know in your heart it won't
Get no better
You you this one's for you
You you this one's for you
