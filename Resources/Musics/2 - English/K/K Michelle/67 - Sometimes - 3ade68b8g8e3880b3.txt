SOMETIMES

[Verse 1]
I would run down the street bare feet
If I could write my destiny
I can't accept you being over me
But when it comes to you
I'll believe anything
Just like when I believe she was nothing
She was something
You went running
How you gonna do me like that
I still want you back
Man I still want you back

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, Lord have your mercy
For loving him religiously
I should be praying for better things
Instead of praying for a man
Who don't give a fuck about me

[Hook]
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
Sometimes the love will last
But sometimes it won't

[Verse 2]
If I could write the perfect script
It would be on some notebook shit
And I don't like ya' mama
But I hope she fine
I think about her from time to time

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, Lord have your mercy
For loving him religious
I should be praying for better things
Instead of praying for a man
Who don't give a fuck about me

[Hook]
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
Sometimes the love will last
But sometimes it won't
(Repeat)

[Bridge]
I never felt so confused
I never felt so used and abused
What the hell did I do to you
Where's the man that stood in the rain
Brought me Sunflowers everyday

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, Lord have your mercy
For loving him religiously
I should be praying for better things
Instead of praying for a man
Who don't give a fuck about me

[Hook]
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
They tell you that they love you
Then turn around and leave you there
It isn't right it isn't fair
I can't believe you left me here
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
And I miss you so bad
But I know that you gone
