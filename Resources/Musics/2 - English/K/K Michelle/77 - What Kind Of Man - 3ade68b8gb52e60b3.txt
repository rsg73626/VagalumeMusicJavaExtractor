WHAT KIND OF MAN

You know what they say real men do real thangs
but u know its cool
no hate
no love but there ain't no hate
cuz if u knew better u do better
for real, yup!
I should have never loved you in the first place
now its hard for me to look you in your face

I am askin God to please remove this hate
if whats done is done then it just might be to late
you've become the enemy when you put ur hands on me
cuz I never thought I'd see, the day when I don't want you
with everything we been thru
now I am askin you what kind of man are you?

how u just gon up an leave?
when I gave you all of me?
this shit I cant believe
what kind of man are you?
your not the man I thought you'd be
no noo
so I am askin you again
what kind of man are you?
I love you so much that I prayed with you

your lifes been hard but my lifes been hard to
my soul my head my heart is so confused
didn't think that you could hurt me like you do
treat me like you do an I was good to you
had ur back when others turned they back on you
people warned me about you but I told em its not true
now I look just like ur fool

now I am askin you what kind of man are you?
how u just gon up an leave?
when I gave you all of me?
this shit I can't believe
what kind of man are you?
your not the man I thought you'd be
no noo
what kind of man would lie to me in my face

make love to me everyday
this is my life, not some type of game you play
but I promise this is the end
hell no we can't be friends
cuz I don't want to see your ass again
now I am askin you what kind of man are you?

how u just gon up an leave?
when I gave you all of me?
this shit I cant believe
what kind of man are you?
your not the man I thought you'd be
no noo
