PÃ€Y MY BILLS

Drip drip
Drop drop
Oh boy I'm real hot
Baby don't stop

I'mma put these legs behind my head
Throw these panties behind the bed
Remember all that shit you said
No foreplay I'm already wet

Back it up
Back it up
Boy it's going down
Drop it low
Drop it low
Ass to the ground
Baby baby I gotta know now
If you ready for what's about to go down

I'mma fuck you
Like I'm tryna pay bills
Georgia power
Cable bill
Baby sitter
Tonight you will

Let me tie up my weave
Don't wanna mess it up
When I'm deep up in them sheets
A lot of time spent on my knees
But I damn sure ain't praying
I'm gone tell you what you wanna hear
When you put them legs up in the air
Boy you got that work
Got my booty bouncing everywhere
Left to the right I'm gonna go all night
How you feeling good like that
Lean it it's right

Back it up
Back it up
Boy it's going down
Drop it low
Drop it low
Ass to the ground
Baby baby I gotta know now
If you ready for what's about to go down

I'mma fuck you
Like I'm tryna pay bills
Georgia power
Cable bill
Baby sitter
Tonight you will

I'mma give you birthday sex on a regular day
I'mma have you asking bout it
You gone give me praise
I'mma give it to you every type of way
Till it ain't nothing else for me to say

You know sometimes
You just gotta pay what you owe
I mean Sometimes
He does it so good you just need to tip him

I'mma fuck you
Like I'm tryna pay bills
Georgia power
Cable bill
Baby sitter
Tonight you will

I'mma fuck you
Like I'm tryna pay bills
Georgia power
Cable bill
Baby sitter
Tonight you will
