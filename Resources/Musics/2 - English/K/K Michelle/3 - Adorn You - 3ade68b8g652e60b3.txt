ADORN YOU

These arms will always comfort you
and I hope you do what's best for me
and I know that you're married and you got them kids
but this shit's getting real, can't help how I feel
hate to ask you to leave, but no more holidays alone
as your house was kindly home
I need you

let my love adorn you, hey, baby
I'm selfish 'cause I love you
always thinking of you
but I'm going to it and even if I walked away
my heart will still remain
let my love adorn you, oh, baby
let my love adorn you
I'm going to it, don't know what I'm doing
I just wanna love you

thank you for being a fan
travel down the road and back again
your heart is true, you're a pal and a comforter
