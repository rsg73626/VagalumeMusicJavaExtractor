WHEN I GET A MAN

It's been awhile
Since I had a love that's all mine
Niggas came to win
And not wasting my time
I'm maintaining screaming out
Fuck it I'll be fine
But I can't act like
It don't ever cross my mind
I would give all this shit up
Just to stay home and be your wife
Fold some clothes give you what you like
Boy you just don't know

[Pre-hook]
You gon' luck up when you get it
Boy you better not miss it
I'm gonna give you all this love

[Hook]
Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
When I get a man

[Verse 2]
I'm gon' roll it up
Back it up pour it how you like
Baby one hit
Just might change your whole life
Baby I'm down to ride
I'm in the passenger side
This good love we got can't be denied
I wanna give this shit up
Just to come home to you at night
Don't care how I feel
I'll make sure you right
You can have whatever you like

[Pre-hook]
You gon' luck up when you get it
Boy you better not miss it
I'm gonna give you all this love

[Hook]
Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
When I get a man

[Bridge]
I'mma treat him like a king
He gon' be my everything
He gon' love the hell outta' me
I won't hold back anything
No more heartbreak
I got a new song to sing

[Hook]
Cause when I find a man
He's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
Man he's gon' love me
I'm gon' cater serve ya
Give you what you deserve
He's gon' love me
When I get a man
