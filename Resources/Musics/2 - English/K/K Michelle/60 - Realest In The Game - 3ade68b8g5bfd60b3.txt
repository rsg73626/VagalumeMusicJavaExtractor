REALEST IN THE GAME

Still no fucks

cause I bring the pain

and that's a dam shame
I ain't a bitter

I'm a little different
I do what I want to
industry don't like me
cause I'm just like you
I sing for all of my girls
who been hurt all around the world

and they say I'm crazy
cause I'm not the type of chick
that's gon let you play me
I'm not your average r&b singer
I act a dam fool
I can be fly without designer shoes
been through too much
I got nothing to loose
I don't give a dam about you judging me
I can't help it I'm from the street
I'm really trying
tryna get better
ima take my time
ima get it together
oh oh oh
