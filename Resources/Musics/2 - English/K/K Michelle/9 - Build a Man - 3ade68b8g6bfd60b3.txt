BUILD A MAN

There was lance he wasn't ready
oh so young, baggage heavy
and there was chris
laid in tennessee but he fucked up and had twins on me
(oh) oh a little piece, piece of each thats all I need
little piece, piece of each
build him her a fan for me
there was kellz, he adored me
loved to hear me sang but control me
there was this actor, had a baby
not the same dude you see in the movie
is it love, was he acting?
but I missed him how did this happen
so many men gave me a song to sing
but none of them gave me a ring
a little piece, piece of each thats all I need
if only I could build me a man

why didn't mother tell me (tell me)
they would take the best of me
leave the rest of me in pieces
why didn't daddy tell me (tell me)
that they're only selling dreams
what they do is what they mean

oh (oh) if I could give him a heart back
only beats me (beats me)
always follow me
oh (oh) give me him a set of eyes that
only look at me (only look at me)

if only I could build me a man
he be everything (oh)
if only I could build me a man
I'll make him perfect (perfect) for me (for me)
'cause all the ones I know
they are disappoint and do whatever they want
if only I could build me a man (a man)
I'll make him perfect (perfect) for me (for me)

I wish it was as simple as a build a bear assembly
I'd have the necessary parts he be customized for me
and smoke a little weed (weed)
heartbreak but still a little street

oh ooh if I could give him a part that
only be for me
(always follow me)
ooh I give him a set of eyes that only look at me
(only look at me)

if only I could build me a man
he be everything (oh)
if only I could build me a man
I'll make him perfect (perfect) for me (for me)
'cause all the ones I know
they are disappoint and do whatever they want
if only I could build me a man (a man)
I'll make him perfect (perfect) for me (for me)

I'll build him up just to let me down
I'll give him some shoes so they can just walk out
a great hoe they were so they can be with her
and I'm here broken hearted

if only I could build me a man
he be everything (oh)
if only I could build me a man
I'll make him perfect (perfect) for me (for me)
all the ones I know
they are disappoint and do whatever they want
if only I could build me a man (a man)
I'll make him perfect (perfect) for me (for me

da la la da daa
if only I could build me (build me)
a ohh ohh um
cause all the ones I know (know)
they are disappoint (disappoint)
build me a man
I'll make him perfect for me
