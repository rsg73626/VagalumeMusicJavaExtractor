GO OFF

Think you bossing and
cause you bought some titties and some teeth
god made me, you're just a trick that upgraded me
'cause you can lie on every radio and shit
but your karma ain't gonna let you get away with it

so tell your bitch stop talking about shit she ain't seen
I don't mean no disrespect, but she don't wanna fuck with me
'cause I'll be on my bullshit, they just wanna
stop it, always try to question it
but this is just the way I is, take it or leave it

yeah, I might be crazy, but I'm talented as fuck
and all I wanna do is drink this jack in my cup
and go off, I go off, man, I go off, I go off
everybody's saying that I won't be shit
but them the same niggas that be riding my dick
I go off, I go off, man, I go off, I go off

it's funny how they do you, they love you, then they hate you
these real niggas is dying out, I'm listening to my radio
like 'what the fuck is y'all talking about? '
ain't nothing y'all can tell me about this music shit
I done seen it all, I done survived it
niggas want that fast fame, they never end up lasting
k. Michelle forever and I don't give a fuck if you feel the same
'cause I'll be on my bullshit, they just wanna stop it
always try to question it
but this is just the way I am, take it or leave it

yeah, I might be crazy, but I'm talented as fuck
and all I wanna do is drink this jack in my cup
and go off, I go off, man, I go off, I go off
everybody's saying that I won't be shit
but them the same niggas that be riding my dick
I go off, I go off, man, I go off, I go off
