DRAKE WOULD LOVE ME

I would be the apple of his eye
He would treat me like his grand prize
Trophy, make me feel every bit worth it
I would be his centerpiece and
He'd show me off while we're at the grammys
Winning, nominated, they'd hate it

But even though you don't appreciate me
You can't see what I see
But someone will believe in me
And the love that I'm giving
Drake would love me
He would kiss me
He would touch me like I need
Drake wouldn't leave me
He would keep me
Never break his promises
I'd be the best he ever had
He'd be on his best behavior
He would make me so proud
Drake would love me

I would never ever have to cry and
If I did, yes, he would make me right
Take care of me
For me he'd do anything
He wouldn't change
He always stay the same
He would tell the truth
He wouldn't play no games
His motto would be giving me his all

Oh I know that you don't appreciate me
You can't see what I see
Someone will believe in me
And the love that I'm giving
Drake would love me
He would kiss me
He would touch me like I need
Drake wouldn't leave me

He would keep me
Never break his promises
I'd be the best he ever had
He'd be on his best behavior
He would make me so proud
Drake would love me

There comes a time in a woman's life
When she knows it ain't worth a fight
This can't be love, this can't be life
I'm a good woman, not afraid to let go
That's how I know
Drake would love me
He would kiss me
He would touch me like I need

Drake wouldn't leave me
He would keep me
Never break his promises
I'd be the best he ever had
He'd be on his best behavior
He would make me so proud
Drake would love me
