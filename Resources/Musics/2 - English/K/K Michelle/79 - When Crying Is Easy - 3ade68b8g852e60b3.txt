WHEN CRYING IS EASY

Alot of yall think yall know me
yall don't know nothin bout me
(ohh oh oh) (yea yea yea yeahh)
this life is such a mystery to me
searching for something make me happy
I have everything, no reason to complain
is there any medicine for this pain?

for some reason I'm still struggling to find my way
I had times when I was full with no food on my plate and
I'm not rich but far from struggling
it seems the more I did the greater my struggle is (oh ohh)

(still fucked up, still acting tough
I'm my own worst enemy
always the life of the party
am I having fun? Not hardly)
if it wasn't for my son
I would probably be on drugs
this jack daniels ain't enough

when crying is easy
(can't stop the tears from falling
why do the streets keep calling me?)
when crying is easy
(I should be smiling 'cause God
has been so good to me)
when crying is easy
(I'm so scared that my life

will be taken from me)
when crying is easy
(oh oh)
when crying is easy
(I'm so tired of crying)

I've cried so much that I am feeling dehydrated
the more they say they love me
the more I'm filled with self-hatred
the label they believed in me
so they gave me what I said I need
new breast, new teeth but why
in the hell do I feel so cheap?

got me running from myself through my songs
this music is doing less help more harm
made me take a real look at myself
evaluate the little self-esteem I have left
(oh ohh)

(still fucked up, still acting tough
I'm my own worst enemy
always the life of the party
am I having fun? Not hardly)
if it wasn't for my son
I would probably be on drugs
this jack daniels ain't enough

when crying is easy
(can't stop the tears from falling
why do the streets keep calling me?)
when crying is easy
(I should be smiling 'cause God
has been so good to me)
(he's been so good to me)
when crying is easy

(I'm so scared that my life will be taken from me)
(I'm so scared)
when crying is easy
(oh oh)
when crying is easy
(I'm so tired of crying)

tried to find it in a man
tried to get it from my fans (I tried to get it from my fans)
tried to pour it from a cup
but I still ain't have no luck (yeah)
tried to find it in my heart
tried to cover up the scars
sometimes I feel like I'm from mars
how can crying can't be hard?

when crying is easy
(can't stop the tears from falling
why do the streets keep calling me?)
when crying is easy
(I should be smiling 'cause God
has been so good to me)
when crying is easy
(I'm so scared that my life will be taken from me)

(so scared)
when crying is easy
(oh oh)
when crying is easy
(I'm so tired of crying)
