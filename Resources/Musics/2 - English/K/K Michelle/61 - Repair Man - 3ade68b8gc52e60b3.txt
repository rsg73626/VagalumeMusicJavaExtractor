REPAIR MAN

I know he was the past, but the past tore me up in little pieces
I never knew I was a fool couldn't believe he was
capable of creeping cheating creeping
took me by surprise, couldn't see it in his eyes
but the lipstick on his collar brought truth to all
the lies, now I'm sitting in doubt with all these
feelings about... how all men are the same
maybe you can change that

I know you brought your tools today
my heart needs a few repairs
and I will open up (baby I'm not scared)
just a few adjustments here and there
can you be my repairman? (my repairman)
my repairman (my repairman)
can you be my repairman? (my repairman)
my repairman, my repairman

if I was blind I could see that you're the right
guy for a good position (and I guarantee)
all the girls ain't just no type of competition
(you took me by surprise when I saw it in your eyes)
this feeling is so real to me (boy you are the truth)
come and be my handy man and fix all the damage I have

to all my ladies up in here if you need
a handy man say oh... ooh... ooh
and if he putting in overtime, won't you treat
that man right say oh... ooh... ooh
cause I really need somebody, to pull it together
and mend all the pieces of my heart... come be my handy man... oohh
