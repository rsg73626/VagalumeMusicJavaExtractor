MY LIFE (FEAT. MEEK MILL)

My life
My life
Isn't my life

What you know bout the grind in the street
He move and work out of town every week
I know about it
I know about it
What y'all know bout them girls on the pole
She make her money every night
Taking off her clothes
I know about it
Yep I know about it

Cause all my life I've been struggling and stressing
That's why I come up in this bitch with aggression
Where I'm from niggas die everyday
Bet you ain't seen a nigga die right in ya face

The life the life
The sacrifice
The grind the grind
You get sometimes
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it
You try and try to live right
But we get blinded by the life
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it

These niggas turning hoes into wife's
Went in raw now you stuck with her for life
I know about it
Bet y'all know something about it
Three years he been doing the same thing
You can hang it up you'll never get a ring
Cause I know about it
Bet I know some thing about it

Cause all my life I've been struggling and stressing
That's why I come up in this bitch with aggression
Where I'm from it ain't flowers and candy
I'm just happy the life didn't get me

The life the life
The sacrifice
The grind the grind
You get sometimes
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it
You try and try to live right
But we get blinded by the life
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it

I said the life the life
The streets are a bitch and I made her my wife
I made her my wife
I couldn't afford but I made her my price
Cause under the lights the money the cars
Even the ice I wanted it all
Some nights we were up selling the raw
And ducking them d from a hell of charges
I wanted to shine amongst with the stars
I wanted to grind they telling me nah
I felt like these niggas was telling me starve
My mama she told me I'm headed for bars
Bars, and where did it take me
To a cell and a yard
Running bar with the killers
Talking fellas and all

The life the life
The sacrifice
The grind the grind
You get sometimes
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it
You try and try to live right
But we get blinded by the life
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it
