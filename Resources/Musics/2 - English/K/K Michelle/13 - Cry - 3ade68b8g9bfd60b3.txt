CRY

Yeah, yeah
nobodies off limits
not even your friends
I'm about to go in, about to go in, about to go in
I'm gon' do something I never do, I'mma try and hurt you, too
feels so damn good to be cold
and I don't even care if you know
I'mma let him kiss my body, touch my body
record and make sure you find it
how you gone trip?
boy, you've been with everybody
you started, I'mma finish!
you made that bed, now you gone lay in it
you gone suffer, you gone suffer
for everything you did
you gone suffer, you gone suffer
I then took too much of this

you gone cry, you gone pay me in tears
you gone cry, you owe me for all these years
you gone cry
'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge so
cry

I've learned from the best, I've learned from you
it's easy to do the shit that you do
I could just switch it up on ya
used to be me, that was out here stressing
so give what came and cares
now you missed your blessings
you gone suffer, you gone suffer
for everything you did
I'm not bitter, stay with her
maybe she can take your shit!

you gone cry, you gone pay me in tears
you gone cry, you owe me for all these years
you gone cry!
'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge so
cry

I deserve to get my point across
before all we had was lost
now we are both hurt by the one we love
I know it's wrong but I want to see you cry
cry [x3]
you gone cry, you gone pay me in tears
you gone cry, you owe me for all these years
you gone cry!
'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge so
cry
