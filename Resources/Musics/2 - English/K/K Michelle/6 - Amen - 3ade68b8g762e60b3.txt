AMEN

There's some rich niggas in the building (amen)
and a whole lot of bad bitches. (amen)
and my weave is laid hella tight (amen)
and your man just bought the bar tonight

say I'm the best and I'm like church
I see them hating bitches, I'm like church
my shoes cost more than your life is worth
he said he wanna fuck I'm like money first
get my money first

forgive me for my sins, I'm so sorry
I've been pimping all these men, I'm so sorry
but fuck 'em, man, I've been through too much
jack daniel is the only man I'll ever trust
bottle after bottle, I drink until I can see no more
I see why they mad, 'cause my ass won't fit through the door
left cheek, right cheek, everybody look at me
I'll be out here in these streets, respecting all the tennessee

there's some rich niggas in the building (amen)
and a whole lot of bad bitches. (amen)
and my weave is laid hella tight (amen)
and your man just bought the bar tonight

say I'm the best and I'm like church
I see them hating bitches, I'm like church
my shoes cost more than your life is worth
he said he wanna fuck I'm like money first
get my money first
amen!
