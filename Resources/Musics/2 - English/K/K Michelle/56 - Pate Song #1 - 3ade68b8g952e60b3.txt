PATE SONG #1

Love, where you've been? I've been missing you, old friend
and I wonder if you feel the same
I missed the feeling you bring and the song that you made me sing
and the smiles in the morning, now you're gone and I'm mourning
so come back to me, please, come back to me
'cause I miss the magic, this time I won't take you for granted
love, come back to me. Where are you now that I'm ready?

long time, no see. Long time, no see
it's been a while since I felt so strong
I'm telling you much too long
long time, no see
long time, no see. Long time, no see
long time, no see. Long time, no see
come back to me

love, once knew, things change, but not you
I like to think in my mind you're still here
so what I need is your hand, love me at this day
I won't take you for granted
I heard you good with second chances
so come back to me, please, come back to me

'cause I miss the magic
this time I won't take you for granted, no
love, come back to me. Where are you now that I'm ready?
long time, no see. Long time, no see
it's been a while since I felt so strong, I'm telling you much too long
long time, no see. Long time, no see
I apologize and I hope that I'll make it clear
that I appreciate the fact that you were near me

well, maybe I can change my wrong to right
baby, if I try
maybe I can send you back into my life
come back to me. Where are you now that I'm ready?
long time, no see. Long time, no see
it's been a while since I felt so strong
I'm telling you much too long
long time, no see
long time, no see. Long time, no see
long time, no see. Long time, no see
