NOT INTO YOU

Hey ladies, real talk
if yall dont never listen to nothing I say
yall listen to this, this that pain medicine
the real, so check it out
true story

I know that you want happy ever after
and I'm not saying it don't exist
but you can't keep forcing fairy tale romance
on a temporary prince
'cause love ain't supposed to hurt
remember what you're worth
you gotta come first
and no matter how bad you want him around
you can't be a star with him pulling you down, ooh

'cause he's just not that into you
quit chasing and face the truth
this ain't meant to discourage
don't keep giving him your heart
I'm tired of seeing us hurting
crying over men that ain't worth it
know when to walk away, 'cause he's not into you
people only do what you allow them to
so stop letting a man run your life

ooh 'cause no one cares for you
the way that you're supposed to, girl
you gotta learn the gift of saying good bye, saying good bye
'cause love ain't supposed to hurt
if he ain't coming home, quit calling his phone
oh yea, girl, be aware of the signs, quit wasting your time
he's playing with your mind, hey

'cause he's just not that into you
quit chasing and face the truth
this ain't meant to discourage
don't keep giving him your heart
I'm tired of seeing us hurting
crying over men that ain't worth it
know when to walk away, 'cause he's not into you

I've been where you've been
I've wasted tears and precious time
gave all of me just to end up empty
but I'm a living example
of what happens when you say 'no more'
don't ever let another to stop you from living
you gotta know

'cause he's just not that into you
quit chasing and face the truth
this ain't meant to discourage
don't keep giving him your heart
I'm tired of seeing us hurting
crying over men that ain't worth it
know when to walk away, 'cause he's not into you
all my ladies, he's not into you, yeah
