I LOVE THE MONEY

Luxury cars
I like nice thangs
creme
basic instinct
money here
money there
I got cash everywhere
look around
no my life ain't fair

everybody ain't able
so I stay on my hustle
I really do this
man I really do this
oh oh oh ooh

I love the money
yeah the money love me
all I need is that
green green green
pledge allegiance
to the paper chase
I love the money
I love the money

I love the money
yeah the money love me
all I need is that
green green green
pledge allegiance
to the paper chase
I love the money
I love the money

ain't always been
rocking mcqueen
(mcqueen)
bare-ly had food to eat
had a penny
made a dollar
turned that dollar to a million
now I'm throwing these racks
cripples falling from the ceiling

everybody ain't able
so I stay on my hustle
I've been through the shit
so I deserve this
oh oh oh ooh

I love the money
yeah the money love me
all I need is that
green green green
pledge allegiance
to the paper chase
I love the money
I love the money

I love the money
yeah the money love
all I need is that
green green green
pledge allegiance
to the paper chase
I love the money
I love the money
