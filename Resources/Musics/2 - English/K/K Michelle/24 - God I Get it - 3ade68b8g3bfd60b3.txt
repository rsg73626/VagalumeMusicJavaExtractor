GOD I GET IT

Always loving what don't love me
put my trust in things I don't need
my poor heart should be mad at me
I just leave my wounds to bleed

haven't I learned anything
you showed me signs to help me see
but I love so blindly
I'm taking full responsibility

god I get it
I'm a mess & I admit it... Whoa
I keep learning the same lessons
while I'm missing out on blessings
god I get it... Whoa whoa

god I get it
I'm a mess & I admit it... Whoaa
I keep learning the same lessons
while I'm missing out on blessings
god I get it

probably should of just had one glass
but instead I started a bath
don't feel better I still feel bad
not the first time won't be the last

haven't I learned anything
showed me signs to help me see
but I love so blindly
I'm taking full responsibility

god I g-e-e-t it
I'm a mess & I admit it... Whoa
I keep learning the same lessons
while I'm missing out on blessings
god I get it... Whoa

god I g-e-e-t it
I'm a mess & I admit it
I keep learning the same lessons
while I'm missing out on blessings
god I get it

I know the truth but still do wrong
no it can't be worked
I'd rather still be left alone
they don't know my heart
they tare me apart
tryna get it together

god! I get it!
I'm a mess & I admit it
I keep learning the same lessons
while I'm missing out on blessings
god I get it

god I get it
I'm a mess & I admit it
I keep learning the same lessons
while I'm missing out on blessings
god I get it
