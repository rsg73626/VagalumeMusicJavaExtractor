CRAZY LIKE YOU

Do you remember, that day in December?
I'm no beginner, and you not a first time offender
Pointing fingers like arrows
When is you out with these hoes
Oh boy you just don't know, you make me me wanna
Kill the one I'm with, you got me popping pills
So I don't feel shit
From where I'm standing, I'm convinced
That I didn't do it to myself, you did I-I-I-t

I-I-I hope you get this life times ten (ten)
Loose more than you w-I-I-I-n
Lord forgive me, I'm your sins
I'm so over men

Baby you, you make me crazy
You got me acting like a fool
Crazy like you
And baby you, I need someone who
Crazy like you
Crazy, crazy, crazy
You make me crazy
Crazy like, crazy like yoouu

Don't make me call your friend
Lie to 'em and tell em that you like men
Call yo momma up
Cause yo daddy be trickin' on my best friend
I would spend yo money up
But you don't even make enough
Versace Jordans', and Gucci
I burn all yo shit up

I hope you get this back times two
Hope your kids just as ugly as you
Lord forgive me of my sins
I can't let the devil win

Baby you, you make me crazy
You got me acting like a fool
Crazy like you
And baby you, I need someone who
Crazy like you
Crazy, crazy, crazy
You make me crazy
Crazy like, crazy like yoouu
Crazy like you
Crazy like you
Crazy like you
Crazy like you

Uh, uh, uh, listen
Pain and disgrace is that look on my face
When I think about that time I wasted with you
Walk in the club, if I see fuck nigga he askin' how I'm doin'
I say, better than you
Feeling yourself, I ain't feeling this lately
Took me for granted, I rocked with you baby
Now you want me back, get the fuck out my face
Needed a break cause you driving me crazy
Broke ass nigga, Joke ass nigga
Five dollars on the smoke ass nigga
Stay at home with ya folks ass nigga
Momma pay your car note ass nigga
Lil dick, weak stroke ass nigga
Gone on with ya shrimp ass
Ain't got nothing else to say to ya
Thats why I changed my number on yo bitch ass

Baby you, you make me crazy
You got me acting like a fool
Crazy like you
And baby you, I need someone who
Crazy like you
Crazy, crazy, crazy
You make me crazy
Crazy like, crazy like yoouu
Crazy like, crazy like
Crazy like you
Crazy like, crazy like
You make me crazy like You
