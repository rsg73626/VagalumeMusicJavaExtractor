SUMMER

Always
always
in my sight
never thought that you could be the one to
change my life
I loved you way before
I knew your name
outta nowhere you're the
healing to my growing pains
when you sing
your song
I get tears in my eyes
I believe I can fly
even when you're wrong
you've done so much right
that it's all justified
but tell me

how could you love summer
before winter nights?
I'll be by your side
just tell me
how could you love summer?
I'll hold your umbrella
in the rain
I'm down for
anything

when a
when a woman loves
she will let you go and
be with who you dreamin' of
be quiet
when she feels like screaming out
when she really wants to be
who you can't live without

(ooh oo ooh)

since you were the first
to call me queen
you're the only king
I'll ever need

how could you love summer
before winter nights?
I'll be by your side
just tell me
how could you love summer?
I'll hold your umbrella
in the rain
I'm down for
anything

even though
you're not my own
I'll still love you
through this song
and even if you
turn your back
I'll still love you
like that

how could you love summer
before winter nights?
I'll be by your side
just tell me
how could you love summer?
I'll hold your umbrella
in the rain
I'm down for
anything

how could you love summer
before winter nights?
I'll be by your side
just tell me
how could you love summer?
I'll hold your umbrella
in the rain
I'm down for
anything
