I KNOW YOU WON'T

I know you don't mean to be mean to me
'cause when you want to you can make me feel like we'd belong, oh, we belong
lately I feel like all I am is a backup plan
I say I'm leaving and you smile at me and I forget every word I said

I'm buy into those eyes, and into those lies
you say you'll call, but I know you
you say you're coming home, but I know you
you say you'll leave her alone, but I know you
you say you'll change, but I know you won't

I wish you were here with me, like you're supposed to be
but here I am, just starring at this candle burning bright
and still no sound, footsteps on my stairs, your voice and I'd be with

you say you'll call, but I know you
you say you're coming home, but I know you
you say you'll leave her alone, but I know you
you say you'll change, but I know you won't

you say you'll change, but I know you
you say you're coming home, but I know you
just leave her alone, but I know you
you say you'll change, but I know you won't
