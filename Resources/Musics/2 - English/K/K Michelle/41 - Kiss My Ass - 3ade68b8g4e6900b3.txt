KISS MY ASS

Listen, I'm tired of your shit, uhu
Turn me up so I can hear me,
I need to hear me
I'm so tired of your shit, oho
You ain't shit and I'm leaving

I'm so tired of paying these bills for you
And that chick keep saying she pregnant too
Hope that baby don't look like neither one of you
Now that's what I call an ugly truth
So I'm through, I'm through

Cause you weren't to love but she was ready, aham
Wanna show me it's real, here the ...for you
What you gonna do
By the way, don't try to play me
12 years of looking crazy for you, you
No, .... you, you

Cause I know who you are
And all you've put me through
To raise your glass,
I hate every man
You can just, kiss my ass
Baby you can just kiss my ass, mhm, oh

Cause you know who you are
And all you've put me through
Raise your glass, cheers to my past
I ain't even mad, kiss my ass
...kiss my ass, uhm

The streets be talking bout what you do
And I'm gonna be running home out 2
While you're searching acting crazy
All in my phone than you're lately
Maybe she can pay that bill too

Cause you weren't to love but she was ready, aham
If you wanna show it's real, haters like...
What you gonna do

Cause I know who you are
And all you've put me through
Raise your glass,
I hate every man
You can just, kiss my ass
Cause I know who you are
And all you've put me through
Raise your glass,
Cheers to my past
... than work, you were living I was hurt
But no more, I'm all gone
Cause I know who you are
And all you've put me through
Raise your glass,
Cheers to my past
I ain't even mad, kiss my ass
Oh you can just, kiss my ass

You and your mama, and a ... pair of drama
Even that baby, is it yours maybe
I don't know
Kiss my ass, oh.
