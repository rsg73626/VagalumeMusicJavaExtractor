LOYAL

I wasn't born last night
I know you niggas ain't right
you can ride for a nigga ya whole life
new pussy fuck it up in one night
now he done played you
got you in his bed
told you that he loved you

when he really loved your head
mane these niggas bout them games
pimp a nigga out
and treat a lame like a lame
I 'ont care
our money spend the same
but you don't fuck the niggas I do
it's levels to this game
I ain't preaching
that's a lot of shit I don't know
but one thing fa sho
never trust a hoe

I'm a show y'all how to do it
listen
get a team of niggas
put all they ass through it
girl you loved him
but he ain't love you
cause if he loved you
he wouldn't act like he do
while you sitting round crying

cause he left
he ain't worried bout you
worry bout yourself
stack that paper girl get your checks
fuck that nigga
be on to the next
cause these niggas ain't loyal
oh oh hoh ooh
so fuck being loyal

why you got an attitude
girl that's everybody dude
cause your nigga ain't loyal

had a 23 year old
with a baby on the way
fuck what people say
I'm a be with him anyway
got a crazy baby momma
she gon get her ass beat
I got hittas in the street
they'll do the shit for me
broke little thot ain't even worth it

she just jealous
of me
cause I'm hotter in these streets
then when the pacers beat the heat
ya living in a fairytale
you can tweet ya life away

is that his baby anyway

cause these bitches ain't loyal
when I was down for you
look at what you put me through
when them bitches want a check from you
cause these niggas ain't loyal
oh oh hoh ooh
so fuck being loyal

why you got an attitude

cause these niggas ain't loyal
oh oh hoh ooh
why you got an attitude
girl that's everybody dude
why you got an attitude
girl that's everybody dude
