JUDGE ME

[verse 1:]
heaven, heaven don't say bye to my soul
I just wanna make it, make it through the dull before the glow
oh I hate that I couldn't get right even if I tried
it's a sin how we love but only God can judge

[chorus:]
judge me, judge me all you want
I'm only human, and I'm perfectly flawed
I know it's easy to point your finger at me
'cause I say the things that only y'all think
so judge me if you need, I bet it works just like me

[verse 2:]
oh oh oh, who wouldn't bite the apple in front of your face
I know that I love, I love the way temptation taste
oh, I hate that I couldn't get right even if I tried
it's a sin how we love but only God can judge

[chorus x2:]
judge me, judge me all you want
I'm only human, and I'm perfectly flawed
I know it's easy to point your finger at me
'cause I say the things that only y'all think
so judge me if you need, I bet it works just like me
