SELF MADE

What you saying?

I'm not thirsty for a attention, I see you checking for me
I'm not impressed 'cause I know what I'm worth
More than a stare or a flash of your keys
Best believe I can do my own thing

Solo in the whip see me drop top coopin it
Ask about me they say k.michelle be doing it
Face it, homie, I ain't never been basic
Shine like a light and my swag is amazing, oh

I do my own thang drive my range
Pay my own bills 'cause I got my own change
Ten stacks in my purse wrapped in rubber bands
In the club popping bottles 'cause I'm the man
I'm a self made chick
What cha saying? what cha saying?

A hundred on the wrist let me teach you a lesson
Nothing came easy to me I guess I'm blessed with
(the drive to go get it)
I be stutting like my daddy
And losing not an option I'm in it to win it

Never be a bust it, baby
Take it for what its worth still f you pay me
Hell yeah, I'm the man but I'm still that lady
And there's no way I'ma let you play me

I do my own thang drive my range
Pay my own bills 'cause I got my own change
Ten stacks in my purse wrapped in rubber bands
In the club popping bottles 'cause I'm the man
I'm a self made chick
What cha saying? what cha saying?

If you a self made chick who got hatas in the place
Look 'em dead in the face and say?
(I'm on it)
If you a self made chick who got these dudes on the chase
Look 'em dead in the face and say?
(I'm on it)
I'm on, I'm on, yep, I'm on

I'ma self made chick, I did it all on my own.
I aint get no handouts check the name on the thrown,
Ms. trina, aka call me amazinn
Or ms independent I don't need you for nothin,
Nada, nothin, I grind like a nigga do.
24/7 so I stay undefeatable,
Get my own chips & my name on all my whips
While the bank account gain interest so the money flips,
Ain't nobody stoppin me, but me
You know I gotta hustle, gotta get it, gotta eat.
Me & k michelle on the grind every week,
Reppin hard for all the ladies who self made the street
Yeah,

I do my own thang drive my range
Pay my own bills 'cause I got my own change
Ten stacks in my purse wrapped in rubber bands
In the club popping bottles 'cause I'm the man
I'm a self made chick . what cha saying?
