MP3 (FEAT. AKON)

I won’t take off your MP3 address
Until you tell me yes
That you received my text
Now you’ve got the sex

I wanna MP3 with you
I’m on your laptop
Goin’ to download, baby

I wanna MP3 with you
Straight from my hard drive into your software
Gotta let you know I care

I wanna MP3 with you
I want ….. computer software
Gotta let you know I can’t
I wanna MP3 with you
This is the end of edition and ladies!

I wanna MP3 you need (o oh!) .. need (o oh!) need (o oh!)
I wanna MP3 you need (o oh!) .. need (o oh!) need (o oh!)
I wanna MP3 you need

Look at your body like me bu you say nobody
Always .. on PC, cuz she’s whole (?) body
Girl step into my chat room
Every time you think of me
And I’ll get right back to you
So expeditiously

Pushin’ on your keys
Touchin’ on your mouse
Imagine you and me
Runnin’ through your house

I’ll givin you the business
As we try to make some children

I wanna MP3 with you
I’m on your laptop
Goin’ to download, baby

I wanna MP3 with you
Straight from my hard drive into your software
Gotta let you know I care

I wanna MP3 with you
I want ….. computer software
Gotta let you know I can’t
I wanna MP3 with you
This is the end of edition and ladies!

I wanna MP3 you need .. need (o oh!) need (o oh!) need (o oh!)
I wanna MP3 you need .. need (o oh!) need (o oh!) need (o oh!)
I wanna MP3 you need
