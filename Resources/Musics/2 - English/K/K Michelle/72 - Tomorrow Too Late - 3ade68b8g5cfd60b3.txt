TOMORROW TOO LATE

I ain't fucking with you
no more
too familiar
I've been here before
I keep looking at my phone
cause I'm still alone
alone
I took a shower
combed my hair
these legs should be up in the air
but your never ever here
your always somewhere
but really nowhere

if there's a will
there's a way
you better find a way
to love me today
tomorrow's too far away
if there's love in your heart
you better find a way
to love me today
tomorrow is too late

don't you call with your excuses
what the fuck
you think I'm
stupid
boy I know what your doing
you don't have to prove it
cause I already knew it
you'll look back on this day
and regret that
you did me this way
please remember what I say
cause no other woman's
gonna love you the same way

these tears gon dry in the morning
remember what I said
I'm so over you
playing with my hea-ead
if there's love in your heart
you better find a way
to love me today
tomorrow is too late

baby I'm so fed up
time to pick my head up
and go our seperate ways
I hate to see us falling
somewhere love is calling
I'll find it one day

there's a will
there's a way
you better find a way
to show me today
tomorrow's too far away
if there's love in your heart
you better find a way
to prove it today
tomorrows too far away

don't you call with yo excuses
