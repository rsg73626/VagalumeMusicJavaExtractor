I DON'T LIKE ME

Laying in this bed with this man
I know it's sex, but I wish it was more
Praying when he get out this bed
He'll feel the same way he did before!
But I know good damn well when he walks out of that door
I ain't gon' hear from him anymore

Cause if I let him do it, I did it to myself
And I was so dumb, I admit it, I need some help
Cause all that I can see is she's prettier than me
Damn, I wish I had her body
I can hear my self-esteem
I don't like me, me

And I don't feel so pretty today
This mirror don't look the same
Thought I liked the woman I was
But people keep saying, "Change! "
Maybe they're right
I made a mess of my life
I don't know where or when I lost my sight

Cause if I let him do it, I did it to myself
And I was so dumb, I admit it, I need some help
Cause all that I can see is she's prettier than me
Damn, I wish I had her body
I can hear my self-esteem
I don't like me, me
