KILL A MAN

On a stairway of a place where my head lays
My heart is racing
What I'm about to face is a tragedy
'cause he got the best of me
So many deputies
Watching over me
And I'm saying now

Imagine if you were close to the edge and about to fall, fall, fall, fall
I thought about it carefully
But my pain wouldn't stop my glock

Mama, I just killed a man
Put a sparrow to his head
I pulled the trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
And now I gotta throw it all away

In a state of shock
Who would of ever thought
K could pull the trigger
Little old me, said I could pull the trigger, trigger
Now he's lying on the floor
Cause I told him once before
Don't you ever put your hands on me no more

Imagine if you were close to the edge and about to fall, fall, fall, fall
I thought about it carefully
But my pain wouldn't stop my glock

Mama, I just killed a man
Put a sparrow to his head
I pulled the trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
And now I gotta throw it all away

Oh my god what have I done
I took somebody's life to save a life
Hole in one

Now I'm checking my fears
Wont let me hide my tears
I told him once before
If he ever did this to me
It would be the end, be the end

So I just killed a man

No more pain
No more cryin

Imagine if you were close to the edge and about to fall, fall, fall, fall
I thought about it carefully
But my pain wouldn't stop my glock

Mama, I just killed a man
Put a sparrow to his head
I pulled the trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
And now I gotta throw it all away
