SHUT UP

Alot of y'all just got done judging me on tv, omg
I would be lying if I said that I gave a fuck
but y'all wasn't in the room, when he fucked me up
and stop calling joseline, joe she ain't a man, but she surely is a hoe
can't judge that bitch, she just wanna be on
karlie redd even la reid son couldn't put you on
where your boss? Where your check?
where the fuck is berry wise at?
when I need 'em, I remember when making it wasn't easy
you're barely rapping, barely singing

I wish I could say shut up
'less you've been through what I've been, through I'm a you da
shut up, r kelly passed the crown on me
I'm the new king of r&b, so shut up
everybody keep doubting me
you christian's better, stop judging me, so shut up
with this jolly rancher in my mouth I mean &, shut up
shut up, shut up

in the words of momma dee, umm in that order, in that order
I ain't playing with you niggas, out here in these streets
after the king, ain't nothing you could do for me
I don't give a fuck about no nba team
when I'm the one they're putting on that vh1 screen
you niggas wanna hid it, but when you're asking for some money
watch them lames get to running, 'cause they're broke

where your boss? Where your check?
tell me where the fuck is josh forest at
music dying, oh, we need 'em, motherfuckers try to sing and
I wish they would just shut they ass up
all you non-singing bitches, non-rapping niggas
I wish you would just shut up

'cause if you would been through what I'd been through
you'd go crazy, too
shut up
I'm feeling like little kim, a real bitch can never win, no
I bet you you gonna shut up
you're a six-er, but I need a ten
stay your ass on that bench
