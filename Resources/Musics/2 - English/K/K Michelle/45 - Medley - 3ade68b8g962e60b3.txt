MEDLEY

I'm looking good, I'm having fun, this is the best night of my life
uh. I'm off at that patron, I need a ride home, boy
this could be the best night of your life
it's k. Michelle on your motherfuckin radio
somebody call and ask jive, what they waiting for?
f-f-fuck it, it don't matter, though
'cause I'm still a star, I'm a shine baby even if they let it go

but thank you for the titties and the teeth, though
I keep trying, trying to tell 'em I ain't keyshia cole
no disrespect, though, I'm in the club with my heels on
watching black china swing down the pole
king of diamonds, you can find me throwing money like a nigga do
you ain't doing nothing I got liquor too
I have finger, too, shout it to my haters, what you gonna do?
'cause I will take ya nigga too
I'm from the hood, we're feeling good, this is the best night of our life

where's lupe? I wanna have a fiasco
lupe, do you mind if you have sex?
lupe, I think your lasers album is the best
boy, we can watch tv with the sound off
clothes all around the bed, keep the sex steamed up
do you mind if a wear my reeboks? 'cause with
these heels on I can't make it drop

I know this shit's unusual, sex with a mermaid in a pool
why you're sitting there looking confused?
gotta set the monkey bars in my room
I can't swing from them, or swing from you
you think you'll call me?

all I care about is money in this city where I'm from
I'm a sipp 'till I feel it, I don't drink until it's gone
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm grown
and I'm only getting bolder, somebody should have told you
I'm on one, yeah, damn it, I'm on one
how you ban me from the building, what the fuck did I do wrong?
I'm just sitting watching tv and my video was on
and on top of all that shit you tell me that my budget gone
if he ain't got no hits why don't you send his ass home?
I'm on one, yeah, damn it, I'm on one
