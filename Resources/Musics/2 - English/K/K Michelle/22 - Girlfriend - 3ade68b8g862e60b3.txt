GIRLFRIEND

Sorry, I know I'm not supposed to say this
But it's been killing me, so I'm about to say this
But I see you girl up in the club
Talking with her boyfriend, think I'm in love
He looking at me, I'm looking right back
But I'm looking past him, she looking right back
Like she wanna get freaky with k
I'm off the patron so I'm like "okay"
Plus she rocking him fresh fendis
That I like, walk like I like, talk like I like
My body gets me in the vip, close to him means close to she
I know who I am and I'm not confused
But tonight she make me wish I was a dude

I like your girlfriend and I think she's feeling me, too
I like your girlfriend, even though you think
'm talking about you
I like your girlfriend, I know why we caught each other's eye
I like your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

One more shot out of this shit that I'm drinking
And I will be all up in her ear singing
But you don't know what I'd be thinking
But I know she thinking what I be thinking
Shots with your boys, while your girl is dancing
All up on me, man your girl is dancing

Caught you in my eye, like fuck them guys
A crazy connection and I don't know why
My body gets me in the vip
Close to him means close to she
I know who I am and I'm not confused
But tonight you make me wish I was a dude

I like your girlfriend and I think she's feeling me, too
I like your girlfriend
Even though you think I'm talking about you
I like your girlfriend, I know why we caught each other's eye
I like your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

If you found love in the club, put your drinks up
If you're looking good and don't give a what
Put your drinks up

I'm feeling real good, feeling sexy tonight
Switch it up a little or I make you shy
She all on me and it feel so right
I'm just might tonight

I like your girlfriend and I think she's feeling me, too
I like your girlfriend
Even though you think I'm talking about you
I like your girlfriend, I know why we caught each other's eye
I like your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
