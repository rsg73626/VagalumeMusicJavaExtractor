RIDE OUT

You won't understand the tears I cried
All those nights you wasn't around
You crossed the night and now is time
All 'cause you wasn't around

So don't be mad I'm not get in
My shit ain't ride out
You gonna be mad when another nigga show up and show out
You gonna be mad, when you look back you see you missed out
You're gonna try to callin' back but I ain't without
It's too late, yeah ey ey
Oh it's too late, yeaah, ey

You never thought of walk away
But things change, you're not around
You're giving the chance, the chance to find
Why you were never around?

So don't be mad when I get in
My shit ain't ride out
You gonna be mad when another nigga show up and show out
You're gonna try to callin' back but I ain't without
It's too late, yeah, ey ey
Oh it's too late, yeaah, ey

Ain't nothing 'bout this love gonna work
Thought it could fix it but I'm still worth
You put me through more than I deserve
You had your chance but now it's this turn

It's too late, yeah ey ey
It's too late yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Huh huh huh

So don't be mad when I get in
My shit ain't ride out
You can't be mad when another nigga show up and show out
You're gonna be mad when you look back and see you missed out
Mhm ohh
