DEVIL IN YOU

Devil in you
the pain in my chest
the tears in my eyes
many sleepless nights
lord knows I tried
the calls to my phone
she won't leave us alone
makes me question
what I'm doing wrong

got my hands around her neck
and a slap to her face
who do you think you is
you ain't gonna take my place
the kids in the bed
remember what you said
cause my hearts not beating
I feel like I'm de-ea-ead

devil in you
the devil in you
no God fearing man
would hurt me like you do ooh
the devil in you
the devil in you
cause no man would ever
do me like you do
the devil devil devil
oh it's the devil oh ooh ooh oh ooh
hoh oh

the lies in your eyes
the smell of your clothes
not enough time
for me and yo hoes
I'm closing the door
open up the good book
apparently I read it wrong
let me take another look

saw your hands around her waist
you kissed her on her lips
you out here fucking up
acting like I ain't gon trip

the devil in you
the devil in you
no God fearing man
would treat me like you do ooh
the devil in you
the devil in you
how could you go and
treat me like you do ooh oh oh oh

when a man
finds a wife
he finds a good thing
I know
your bible wouldn't lie to me
it's you
it's you
now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to the lord
that the devil sets you free

the devil
the devil
no God fearing man
would treat me like you do
yeah you the devil
you the devil in you
how could you keep treating me
the way that you do
it's the devil
you the devil
