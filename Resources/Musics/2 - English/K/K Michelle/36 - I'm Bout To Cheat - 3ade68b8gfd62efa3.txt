I'M BOUT TO CHEAT

I know two wrongs don't make a right
But I don't give a damn
Thinking you can do whatever you like
But that don't make you a man
Its so crazy, I never thought
That I'd be the one
Tucked in them sheets
But you did it first
Now watch me do me

How about I just cheat on you
Can't you see what you're making me do
I'm bout to cheat on you
Just to show you what you put me through
You don't take care of your home
I've wasted my time crying
Said I'm so through
I'm bout to cheat on you

You don't pay me no attention
But you don't care enough
But you don't know what you got till it goes missing
Where is my quality time
Staying in every bed but mine
Out running them streets
Tucked in them sheets
Now watch me do me

How about I just cheat on you
Can't you see what you're making me do
I'm bout to cheat on you
Just to show you what you put me through
You don't take care of your home
I've wasted my time crying
Said I'm so through
I'm bout to cheat on you

I could have been more faithful and true to you (hey)
But you treat me like you got nothing to lose (baby)
