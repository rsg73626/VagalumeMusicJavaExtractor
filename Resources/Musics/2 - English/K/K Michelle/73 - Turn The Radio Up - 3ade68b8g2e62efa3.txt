TURN THE RADIO UP

This is for all, all of my girls who lost someone they really love
This is for you, you, you
This is for you, you, you
Turn the radio up high
You.....you.....you.......

I've had some rough days
And some lonely nights
Why he don't want me I'm asking god why
Cant make him love me cause he just don't care
I know that sound crazy but I still want him here
Whats wrong with me and what don't he see
When he told me he was leaving me
Oh I just died, died, died broke down and cried, cried, cried

If he broke your heart
If he made you cry
He keep telling lies (turn the radio up high)
You all alone at night
You know he ain't right
You gave him your life (turn the radio up high)
Praying one day that he might get better
Take it from me girl it don't get no better
Say ohhhhhh, say ohhhhhh (turn the radio up high)

You see me calling your phone
Why don't you pick it up
Don't make me ride by your house
I bet you're with her
You're stepping on my pride
And now I'm in disbelieve
What is this, how the hell you choose her over me
So whats wrong with me
I gave you everything
When he told me he was leaving me
Oh I just died, died, died
Broke down and cried, cried

If he broke your heart
If he made you cry
He keep telling lies (turn the radio up high)
You all alone at night
You know he ain't right
You gave him your life (turn the radio up high)
Praying one day that he might get better
Take it from me girl it don't get no better
Say ohhhhhh, say ohhhhhh (turn the radio up high)

Outside I'm smiling but inside I'm dying
If I said I moved on, then I would be lying
I know in my heart
I could do better than you
But my heart won't let me
I'm so confused

If he broke your heart
If he made you cry
He keep telling lies (turn the radio up high)
You all alone at night
You know he ain't right
You gave him your life (turn the radio up high)
Praying one day that he might get better
Take it from me girl it don't get no better
Say ohhhhhh, say ohhhhhh (turn the radio up high)
