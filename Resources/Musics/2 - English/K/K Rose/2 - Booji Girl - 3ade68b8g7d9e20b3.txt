BOOJI GIRL

If you wish to have me as your girl
Bring me all the money across the world
I don't want your kisses
I want pearls
Oh yeah!

If you wish to have me as your girl
Bring me all the money across the world

Of all the men across the land
It's you who loves me so
I'll tell you once
But never twice
For I'm the one who knows
To be the rich you kill the rich
You take just what they owe
To be a wealthy man
You need a booji girl

I want to be your booji girl
Boy, I can be your booji girl
And she can be your boo

I want to be your booji girl
Boy, I can be your booji girl
And she can be your boo

If you wish to have me as your girl
Bring me all the money across the world
I don't want your kisses
I want pearls
Oh yeah!

If you wish to have me as your girl
Bring me all the money across the world


Of all the men across the land
It's you who loves me so
I'll tell you once
But never twice
For I'm the one who knows
To be the rich you kill the rich
You take just what they owe
For every booji man
There is a booji girl

I want to be your booji
I can be your booji girl
I want to be your booji girl
Boy, I can be your booji girl
And she can be your boo
