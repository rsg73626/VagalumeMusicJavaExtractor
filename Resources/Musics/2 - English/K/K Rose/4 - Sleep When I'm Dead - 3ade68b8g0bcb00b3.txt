SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD

Love it, hate it
Love it, want it
Love it, hate it

Love it, hate it
Love it, want it
Love it, hate it

Mama says I need to take a rest
My boyfriend always wants me home
My doctor says I need to go to bed

No
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad

I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad

I dance, dance, dance awake
I want with who I like

Love it, hate it
Love it, want it
Love it, hate it

And you can't, can't, can't control
What I do tonight

Love it, hate it
Love it, want it
Love it, hate it
I said you can't, can't, can't control
What I do tonight

Love it, hate it
Love it, want it
Love it, hate it

Mama says I need to take a rest
My boyfriend always wants me home
My doctor says I need to go to bed

1, 2, 3 Go!

I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad

I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad

Love it, hate it
Love it, want it
Love it, hate it

Watch me work

I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad

I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
I'll sleep when I'm de-e-e-ad
