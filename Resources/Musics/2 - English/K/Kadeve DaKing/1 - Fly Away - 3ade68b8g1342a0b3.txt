FLY AWAY

Verse 1
Nights on other people's couch
Taking L's while I'm tryna flip a ounce
Street fulla (full of) shells hope none hit the house
Don't let em sniff around
Cuz (because) them pigs got snouts

Catch you in the mud or dirt
Unemployed but he love to work
She live in the hills but she love to twerk
So you catch her on the block
In a mini skirt

Ask a bum what a penny is worth
You life worth less on your enemies turf
We live and we die that's the rules to earth
So we pray for the best
Wear the vest to church

Amen
Beware of them fake friends
Long snake can't see where the head is
You behind can't see where ahead is
When the music stops keep dancing

Chorus
Keep your head to the sky
Just spread your wings and fly
Fly away
Come and fly away with me

People I must insist that
You keep your spirits lifted
Come and fly fly away
Come and fly away with me

Come fly away Come fly away
Come fly away
Come and fly away with me

Verse 2
You love to see the sun when it shines
All the same ya hate when it rains
Tell me this what's love without pain
What's dedication when there's nothing to gain

More stress more push for the process
When ya eat you gotta let it digest
Everybody too big till ya stand up
Look down on em
Then they out they hands up

(yaah)
I demand success
Keep your head up the neck don't rest
Hold on to your blessings
And trash the rest
Ya Damn near float when you at your best

Feeling Ghandi blowing ghanji
I succeed putting failures behind me
Gotta go but I left a trail behind me
So when I get to where I'm going
You can find me

Chorus

Verse 3
You got doubters fakers snakers haters
All of the above I just call em anchors
Leave em at the docks
Fly like you supposed to
Smile everyday get high if you want to

Stress less Gray hair come quick
Life short don't die over dumb
Shit
Live your life no matter carry on
Fly with me bring a carry on

Yeah
Its that feel good vibe
Young wild and free
Live a ill-life

To our soldiers who fight another man's war
Eyes open careful what you stand for
We never forget what you die for
Don't be the reason that yo momma
Gotta cry more
Let yo family be the thing you survive for
And happiness be the thing that strive for

Chorus
