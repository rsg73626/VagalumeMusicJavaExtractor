STONED ON THE SCHOOL BUS

I've been sitting on a smelly bus
To a fucking school that I've had enough of
Baby, I've been failing calculus
Cause the stupid rules weren't meant for us

Come home in the afternoon
My mom's drunk in her bedroom
She screams, "get out of here! "
I don't want to be here

If I could stay in bed all day
Dream I was in a different place
I would be just great
But I'm stoned on the school bus, babe

I've been sitting in the same damn stop
At the corner store
talking 'bout what I'm not
I've been working here a lot
Cause the child support, mother lost

Come home in the afternoon
My father yells out, "fuck you! "
He screams, "get out of here! "
I don't want to be here

If I could stay in bed all day
Dream I was in a different place
I would be just great
Stoned on the school bus, babe

Maybe I'll hitchhike
Maybe ride my bike
Anything to leave
this town tonight
Maybe I'll hitchhike
Maybe ride my bike
Leave me to my whole life

If I could stay in bed all day
Dream I was in a different place
I would be just great
Stoned on the school bus, babe
