NEW EMOTION

It's so unusual laying with you
I see in colors that are all brand new
And I don't recognize the feeling
I float into

You're not like anything that I've ever seen
We live in a strange land
in a violet dream

I've been sad for
most of my life
All my love only bloomed to die
But I love you deep as the blue ocean
You give me new emotion
You give me new emotion
You give me new emotion

It's so unusual being with you
A kind of odyssey I lose me through
And I don't recognize the feeling
I drift into

You're not like anything that I've ever seen
We live in a strange land
in our kind of dream

I've been sad for
most of my life
All my love only bloomed to die
But I love you deep as the blue ocean
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)

(I can't sleep, I can't sleep
Through the new emotion you give to me
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
Through the new emotion you give to me)
It's like I only just learned to breathe
It's like I only just learned to breathe
Been waiting on the new emotion
you're giving me

I've been sad for
most of my life
Had no luck in love, only new goodbye

I've been sad for
most of my life
All my love only bloomed to die
But I love you deep as the blue ocean
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)
You give me new emotion
(You give me new emotion)

(I can't sleep, I can't sleep
Through the new emotion you give to me
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
Through the new emotion you give to me)
