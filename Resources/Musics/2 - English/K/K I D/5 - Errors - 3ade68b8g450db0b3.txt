ERRORS

I'm sorry I couldn't meet
All of their expectations
Lately, I've got no energy
Now they're recommending counselors
And medications
From the corner pharmacy

[pre-chorus]
Everybody's asking me what's wrong
In the living room from dawn to dawn
Have a cigarette 'cause nothing's on

[chorus]
No, I'm not doing my best
Kind of fragile and depressed
I cannot even bring myself to get dressed
And I wish I could
Correct complications in my head
I've tried every little dose they recommend
There's an error in me, da da da da
There's an error in me, da da da da

I wanted to be good
But I was met with complications
Yeah, I got lost along the way
My mother, she called me to express
All her frustrations
I watch pornography all day

[pre-chorus]
Everybody's asking me what's wrong
Lying in a blue haze on the lawn
Took a little more than I should in the garage

[chorus]
No, I'm not doing my best
Kind of fragile and depressed
I cannot even bring myself to get dressed
And I wish I could
Correct complications in my head
I've tried every little dose they recommend
There's an error in me, da da da da
There's an error in me, da da da da

There's never enough medicine
Some bastards said I'd never win
I'll lay alone busy doing nothing
There's never enough medicine
I struggle to wake up again
I'll stay alone busy doing nothing

[chorus]
No, I'm not doing my best
Kind of fragile and depressed
I cannot even bring myself to get dressed
And I wish I could
Correct complications in my head
I've tried every little dose they recommend
There's an error in me, da da da da
There's an error in me, da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
