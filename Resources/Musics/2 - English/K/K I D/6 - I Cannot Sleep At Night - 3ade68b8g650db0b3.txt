I CANNOT SLEEP AT NIGHT

I cannot sleep at night
My anxieties run high and they build up inside
I cannot sleep at night
There's a creature in my room
And he won't say goodbye
Oh, I, when it's dark I go on walks alone
I don't wanna go home
Oh, I, put my head down but I never rest
And my mind is a mess

[chorus]
Steep the tea, watch the tv
I can't get no sleep
Pill I took don't work for me
I can't get no sleep
Steep the tea, watch the tv
I can't get no sleep
Pill I took don't work for me, I can't get no

I cannot sleep at night
The fridge is humming loud
And I can't shut my eyes
I cannot sleep at night
I'm sweating in the sheets
Now with a fever high
Oh, I, when it's dark I go on walks alone
I don't wanna go home
Oh, I, put my head down but I never rest
And my mind is a mess

[chorus]
Steep the tea, watch the tv
I can't get no sleep
Pill I took don't work for me
I can't get no sleep
Steep the tea, watch the tv
I can't get no sleep
Pill I took don't work for me, I can't get no

Have you looked out the window
And seen what's outside?
The images leave me terrified
On the evening news and on the internet
I see things and now I can't rest

[chorus]
Steep the tea, watch the tv
I can't get no sleep
Pill I took don't work for me
I can't get no sleep
See the re-runs on the tv
I can't get no sleep
Pill I took don't work for me, I can't get no

(no sleep)
I can't get no sleep
(no sleep)
(no sleep)
I can't get no
