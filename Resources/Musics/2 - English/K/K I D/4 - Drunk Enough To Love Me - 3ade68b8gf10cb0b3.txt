DRUNK ENOUGH TO LOVE ME

The dog's asleep under the bed
Room got dark, my eyes are red
You say you'll be here at ten
Then don't show, again

I undress and scratch my skin
Can't get you from under it
You make me lose all my religion

You only love me sometimes
Little boy run, make up your mind
Are you high, or drunk enough?
Come love me tonight
Sometimes, little boy, go make up your mind
Are you high, or drunk enough
to love me?
Drunk enough to love me

Little pills, all on the bed
Don't say that the phone was dead
You drink then send messages
At your convenience

I undress and scratch my skin
Can't get you from under it
You make me lose all my religion

You only love me sometimes
Little boy run, make up your mind
Are you high, or drunk enough
Come love me tonight
Sometimes, little boy, go make up your mind
Are you high, or drunk enough
to love me?
Drunk enough to love me

One more drink 'til you love me, love me
One more hit 'til I love you, love you
One more drink 'til you love me, love me
One more drink 'til you love me, love me

You only love me sometimes
Little boy run, make up your mind
Are you high, or drunk enough
Come love me tonight
Sometimes, little boy, go make up your mind
Are you high, or drunk enough
to love me?
Drunk enough to love me

One more drink 'til you love me, love me
One more hit 'til I love you, love you
