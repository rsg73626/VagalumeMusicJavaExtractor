TAKER

By the strip mall cinema
Through the night I wait for ya
I've been good to you
So why'd you do this?
I gave you transcendental love
Drove you 'round and bought your drugs
Now you're acting ungrateful and foolish

[pre-chorus]
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna, gonna give a little? oh, oh
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna give a little?

[chorus]
Every minute that I've got
Every penny I possess
Yes, I give it to you
What you giving back?
(take, take, take)
Falling to my knees a lot
Working hard to get you off
Yes, I give it to you
What you giving back?
(take, take, take)

Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna, gonna give a little? oh, oh
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna give a little?

Did your mother raise her child
To steal then disappear a while?
You show no remorse and show no mercy
Lose my pride, lie face down
In hopes you might come around
Leave me in the sahara, so thirsty

[pre-chorus]
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna, gonna give a little? oh, oh
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna give a little?

[chorus]
Every minute that I've got
Every penny I possess
Yes, I give it to you
What you giving back?
(take, take, take)
Falling to my knees a lot
Working hard to get you off
Yes, I give it to you
What you giving back?
(take, take, take)

Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna, gonna give a little? oh, oh
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna give a little?
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna, gonna give a little? oh, oh
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna give a little?

[chorus]
Every minute that I've got
Every penny I possess
Yes, I give it to you
What you giving back?
(take, take, take)
Falling to my knees a lot
Working hard to get you off
Yes, I give it to you
What you giving back?
(take, take, take)

Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna, gonna give a little? oh, oh
Taker, taker, taker, taker, taker
When you gonna give a little?
(take, take, take)
