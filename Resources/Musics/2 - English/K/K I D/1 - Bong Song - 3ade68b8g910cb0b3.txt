BONG SONG

Hey, what you doing tonight?
Hey, when do you finish your shift?
Hey, come over if you like
Hey, I got some good shit

Floating up 'til we are falling
Lighting up to London Calling

I've been in the basement all night long
Froggy, playing Donkey Kong
It's alright that we're all wrong
So c'mon
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
So c'mon
Pass my bong

Hey, where you at?
Hey, I don't wanna wait
Hey, I got it bubbling
Hey, come to my place

Floating up 'til we are falling
Don't pick up when Mother's calling

I've been in the basement all night long
Froggy, playing Donkey Kong
It's alright that we're all wrong
So c'mon
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
So c'mon, so c'mon
Pass my bong

This is a song about a bong
I could sing it all night long
Now I feel alright, but I'm all wrong
This is a song about a bong
I could sing it all night long
Now I feel alright, but I'm all wrong

I've been in the basement all night long
Froggy, playing Donkey Kong
It's alright that we're all wrong
So c'mon
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
So c'mon
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
Pass my bong
So c'mon, so c'mon
Pass my bong
