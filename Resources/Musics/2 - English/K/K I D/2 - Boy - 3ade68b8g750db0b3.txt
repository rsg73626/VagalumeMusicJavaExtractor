BOY

Whistle at me as you ride your bike down cherry street
Oh, you're very sweet
We spend two days with nothing on
But cassette tapes from 93'

[pre-chorus]
Boy, my joy's in your skin, boy
When we get to talking, boy
I really want it, boy
All of my real filthy dreams come true
When I pull you in the bar bathroom

[chorus]
Oh, boy, I like your tongue in my mouth
Oh, boy, I like my back on your couch
Oh, boy, c'mon and put my anxious heart to rest

Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy

Come outside and help me light my cigarette
Then I'll kiss your neck
Tell me why you hesitate, don't you love me yet?
Don't you love me yet?

[pre-chorus]
Boy, my joy's in your skin, boy
When we get to talking, boy
I really want it, boy
All of my real filthy dreams come true
When I pull you in the bar bathroom

[chorus]
Oh, boy, I like your tongue in my mouth
Oh, boy, I like my back on your couch
Oh, boy, c'mon and put my anxious heart to rest
Oh, boy, I like your tongue in my mouth
Oh, boy, I like my back on your couch
Oh, boy, c'mon and put my anxious heart to rest

Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy
Boy boy, boy boy

Boy, my joy's in your skin, boy
When we get to talking, boy
I really want it, boy
