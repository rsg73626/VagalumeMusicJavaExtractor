I wanna break your heart
I wanna let you know
Just what it's like
To be so dicked around and miserable
I wanna break your heart
Wish I could see you cry
But you're doing okay while
I sorta wanna die

You're making it look easy
You spit me out, then leave me
Do I make it so easy?
I wanna make you feel this

I wanna break your heart
I wanna let you know
Just what it's like
To be so dicked around and miserable
I wanna break your heart
Wish I could see you cry
But you're doing okay while
I sorta wanna die
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon

You're making me feel ugly
Like it's tough to love me
I bet you never feel this way
I wanna make you feel this way

I wanna break your heart
I wanna let you know
Just what it's like
To be so dicked around and miserable
I wanna break your heart
Wish I could see you cry
But you're doing okay while
I sorta wanna die
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon

How long 'til I breathe again?
I sit on curbs by your apartment
And I can't seem to walk away
I can't make you feel this way
How long 'til I breathe again?
I cry on curbs by your apartment
I can't seem to walk away
I can't make you feel this way

I wanna break your heart
I wanna let you know
Just what it's like
To be so dicked around and miserable
I wanna break your heart
Wish I could see you cry
But you're doing okay while
I sorta wanna die
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Dillon
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

I've been chain-smoking a lot
To calm the nerves you gave me, love
Dillon, you motherfucker
