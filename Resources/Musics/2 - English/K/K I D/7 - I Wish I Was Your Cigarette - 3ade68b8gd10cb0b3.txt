I WISH I WAS YOUR CIGARETTE

I see you out every night
Wednesday I asked for a light
If my lucky stars all aligned
Would you love me, love me?

Cause I wish I was your cigarette
Come breathe me, love
Take, take me in
I wish I was your cigarette
Come breathe me, love

I can't count the things
that I want to do to you
I can't even say what you're
putting me through
Every night, every night
every night
Every night, every night
every night

You're leaving town for a long time
On a rock tour of Europe, fly
Under the crescent moon shine
Could you love me, love me?

Cause I wish I was your cigarette
Come breathe me, love
Take, take me in
I wish I was your cigarette
Come breathe me, love

I can't count the things
that I want to do to you
I can't even say what you're
putting me through
Every night, every night
every night
Every night, every night
every night

Wish I was your cigarette, wish
I was your bubblegum
Really close to your tongue
Wish I was your cigarette, wish
I was your bubblegum
Really close to your tongue
Wish I was your cigarette, wish
I was your bubblegum
Really close to your tongue
Wish I was your cigarette, wish
I was your bubblegum
Really close to your tongue

I can't count the things that
I want to do to you
I can't even say what you're
putting me through
Every night, every night
every night
Every night, every night
every night

Every night, every night
every night
Every night, every night
every night
(Wish I was your cigarette, wish I
was your bubblegum
Really close to your tongue)
