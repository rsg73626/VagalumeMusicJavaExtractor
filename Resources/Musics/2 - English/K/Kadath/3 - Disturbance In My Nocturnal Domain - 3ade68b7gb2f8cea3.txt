DISTURBANCE IN MY NOCTURNAL DOMAIN

With the last blink of my eyes 
Total darkness enshrouds me 
Engulfed by an abnormal blackness 
Floating into a realm created by myself 

I'm flying in this astral state, darkness fades (away) 

Feeling free to do whatever I wish to do 
Mysterious domain unknown to any other man 
This is my place, my nocturnal home, my refuge 
Revealing secrets of a distorted mind 

Chorus 1: 

Obey your own thoughts 
Yield to the dream-demons 

Anti-reality, another dimension you need to live 
To refreshen from daily shit and all these humiliations 
Abstract reality, untouchable, so near and yet so far 
Never to reach, materialization of subconscious dreads 

Chorus 2: 

Obey your own thoughts 
Bow to the dream-demons 

Hidden for a long time, childish fears 
Coming out and eating away at me 

Appearing of unreal shapes frightens me 
Start to strike relentlessly, fierce attack 

Chorus 3: 

Obey you own thoughts 
Surrender to the dream-demons 

Wake up!
