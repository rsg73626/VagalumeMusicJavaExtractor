THIRST FOR REVENGE: CHAPTER V OF CHIKATILO

Part I: Back from imprisonment 

Time in jail was a cleansing time. 
Now free to pursue what he desires. 
Restless struggle against criminal impetus. 
Compulsive seek for innocent victims 

New job in a locomotive factory. 
Near future looking encouraging. 
One year after his last murder. 
An eighteen-year-old mentally retarded. 
Shortly after, she lay dead, mutilated. 
Thirty-eight stab wounds in the body. 

Refrain 

Nipples, genitals, tongues, 
Sweet young flesh bitten off. 
Lure, stab, disfigure, violate. 
Insatiable thirst for revenge. 

Part II: Around the country 

On business trips around the country. 
October 16, his fiftieth Birthday. 
Following another boy in the woods. 
Brutal attack, knife blade broken off. 

While travelling and killing. 
Police investigations gaining momentum. 
Anyone convicted of sexual crimes. 
Was checked in great detail. 

Refrain 

Part III: The End 

Decapitate, saw off her legs, 
Cut out her juvenile uterus, 
Slice off part of the face, 
Extreme cannibalistic ferocity. 

One more victim beaten and stabbed. 
The net incessantly closing in. 
Naked body covered with leaves. 
Finally, handcuffed, under arrest.
