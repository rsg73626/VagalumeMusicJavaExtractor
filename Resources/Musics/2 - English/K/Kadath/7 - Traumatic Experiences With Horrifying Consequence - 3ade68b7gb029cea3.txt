TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES WITH HORRIFYING CONSEQUENCE

Kids who kill (2x) 

Life's a badlam, misunderstood children 
Dangerous minds with intention to kill 
Harmless appearance hiding cruel desires 
Young psychopath in a perfect disguise 

Chorus: 

Raped from their own blood-twisted thoughts (2x) 
Resulting from barbaric sexual intercourse 

Impulse to kill starts with slaying birds 
Beating my brother, picking the dog 
Traumatic experiences with horrifying consequence 

"I have to kill! You are all my enemies 
Let me be and you may live 
But don't be sure, shozophrenic habit 
One mixture nice, the other bad 
Bloodlust in your eyes" 

Inner might forces you to take up the knife and to strike 
Voices in your head reminding of memories 
That'llforever remain inside your brain 
"You like to come with Daddy?"I'll do you no 
Harm, so please trust me" Ruled by perverse 
Tendencies, not able to overcome this urge for infantile sex. 

Chorus 

"Daddy, keep away from me, I love you 
But not this way, please don't hurt me" 
Traumatic experiences with horrifying consequence 

Pain and mental agony never to be healed again 
Perpetual damage leading to kill 
Not enough to kill my father, I need to kill all fathers 

Psychological conflict
