STALKING THE PREY: CHAPTER IV OF CHIKATILO

Part I: Six years of slaughtering 

The sixth year of an insane killing spree 
Restless spring, wicked deprecation 
Boring jobhunting, passionate ravaging 
Cruelty exploding into devilish mutilation 

Cut off the lips of innocence 
Put the organs in their own mouth 
Just vengeance for the offence 
Severed genitals in the abdominal cavity 

Refrain 

Stalk the prey, chase the hunter 
Make your pray, regret your blunder 

Living a perfect double life 
Unable to intimacy with his wife 
Seeking for peace of mind 
Sweet white bones to grind 

Part II: Tracked and arrested 

Tracked down in a bus station 
While engaging women into conversation 
Pursuit continued into restaurants, bars 
Chronic brain disease leaves scars 

Young woman sat down next to him 
She laid her head in his lap 
Fondling her juvenile breasts 
Giving him a wet blow job 

Refrain 

Stalk the prey, chase the hunter 
Make your pray, regret your blunder 

Shortly after, he was under arrest 
In the man's brown briefcase 
A length of rope, a long-bladed knife 
Charged with harassment in public place 

Learning of his penchant for children 
But the blood type didn't match 
After only three months of sentence 
Fiendish predator was released 

Refrain 

Stalk the prey, chase the hunter 
Make your pray, regret your blunder
