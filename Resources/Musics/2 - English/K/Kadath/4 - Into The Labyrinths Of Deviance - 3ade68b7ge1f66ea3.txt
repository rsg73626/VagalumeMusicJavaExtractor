INTO THE LABYRINTHS OF DEVIANCE

Still a young and innocent child 
Beaten by his mother and abused by his father 
She always told him ?Don?t look through the key-hole, 
When I?m busy with your uncle? 

Conflict and anger in his mind became worse and worse 
This beautiful cat of our crazy neighbors 
?I could torture and rip it up?, he thought 
Little experiment to control life and death 

Hate, death & sexual desire burning inside him 
Love he needs, but pain and suffering he brings 
The cat became a little pretty blond girl 
Raped and beaten to death, his first human victim 

CHORUS 
Welcome to the labyrinths of deviance 
Enter the gloomy world of depravation 
Into the labyrinths of deviance 
Enter the gloomy world of depravation 

Losing control of his murderous destiny 
What was wrong with this affectionate man? 
Dreams always turned to deviated sex 
Combined with mutilation, open wounds 

CHORUS 

One after one, raped, sodomized, killed 
Each murder more cruel and perfectionated 

The bodies lacerated, cut into pieces and burned 
Ultimate abomination, gruesome hallucination 

Dark fantasies became obssessive reality 
Body count growing month after month 
Sheer panic spreading out in the city 
Unstoppable bloodbath was his fate 

The bodies lacerated, cut into pieces and burned 
Ultimate abomination, gruesome hallucination
