CHTHONIC

To the land of no return
Goes the daughter of the moon
To the land of kurnugi
Through the seven gates of kur

To the dwelling of erkalla's god
Stripped according to rites
For her entering and walking
Sixty diseases unto her

Disease of the eyes to her eyes
Disease of the arms to her arms
Disease of the heart to her heart
Disease of the head to her head

Chthonic sleep of the goddess
By oath returned unto her sister
Anunnaki seated on their thrones
The dead shall smell the smoke offering

Descent of ishtar
Descent of inanna
Rites of passage
Rites of death
