CIRCLE OF MANIA

Crown of abhorrence
Exalted are the ways
Morbid sacrilege
Denial of the holy
Divine essence
Of sheer monstrosity
And the devil
Speaks unto you

Circle of mania

Branded with madness
The mark of the devil
Profound irreligion
Devastating ways
Descending and ascending
I sin to know thee
Searching new heights
and you emerge anew

Circle of mania

Exciting every sense
Demonic lust prevails
Satisfying every impulse
Submit unto the final
Death
