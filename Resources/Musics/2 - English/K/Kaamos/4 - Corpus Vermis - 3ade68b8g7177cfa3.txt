CORPUS VERMIS

Crucifix of man
Silent sterile emblem
Morals of slavery
And your martyrs rejoice

Atonement in holy Ways
Denied for the Path of Sin
Beware to trespass
The servants of the snake

Ascending spiral
The snake of fire
Always moving beyond
Our time and space

At the left hand of god
I'm an enemy of the lamb
My words proclaim heresy
End the body remains

Corpus vermis

Iniquity and madness
The desert's of Gift
Immortal verses
To the fallen

My name is many
For we are many
Oh, apostate ones
Our name is ...
Legion

Corpus Vermis

In the womb of Dur
Mother the dragon
We sow and reap
The rewards of
Godhead
