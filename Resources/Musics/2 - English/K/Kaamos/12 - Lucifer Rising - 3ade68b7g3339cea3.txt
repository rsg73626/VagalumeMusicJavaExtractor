LUCIFER RISING

A fall from grace that is eternal
Into endless maelstrom chasms
Through timeless chaos aeons
By virute of rebellion

Emerged into the fields of mythos
Reborn as beast and thus received
Heretic tongue with words of fire
Satanic might in darkness shrouded

Dawn of fire...son of flame
Lucifer...rising...

Flaming zenith
Mighty fiend
Dreadful light
Infernal star

Gruesome grandeur
Crowned as king
By terror known
Serve through sin

Lepaca lucifer
