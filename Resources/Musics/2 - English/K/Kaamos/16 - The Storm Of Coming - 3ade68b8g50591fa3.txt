THE STORM OF COMING

Come forth with vengeance
Come forth with wrath
Come forth destroyer
From the unknown

The winds bring havoc
The winds bring death
The winds are violent
Storms of the past

The chanting echoes
The chanting calls
The chanting cries
Verbs of mastication

Falling the crown of creation
Old Gods breaking through
Iniquity stars speak of entrance
God prayers won't hold them

Malignant gods of the threshold
Abhorrent their ways being loathsome
Lord prayers won't hold them
Twilight your crown is falling
