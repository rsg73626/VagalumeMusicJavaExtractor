Prophecies lurking front
The depths of time
From beyond the dark
Death shall arrive
And man feared the
Dawn of his demise
Crying out loud
"Oh, lord have mercy"

Doom of man

Crucified martyrs preach
Salvation is lost
The kingdom lies
Ruined, oh woe to thee
The dead shall rise
And walk the earth
Blessing the sheep
And setting them free

Doom of man

The bells of Satan chime
Tunes of damnation time
