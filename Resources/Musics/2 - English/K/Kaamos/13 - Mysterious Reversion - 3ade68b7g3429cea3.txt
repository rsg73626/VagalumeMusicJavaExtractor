The face of god
Cast its light
Unto the void
Creating shadow

The face of evil
Tortuous serpent
The eye of typhon
Lurks at forever

Known as chavajoh
Formula reversed
Of tetragrammaton

Nocturnal spirit
Reverse the flow
Rebellious act
Creates the gold

Gaze into the void
Gaze into the formless
Behold ten hells
In seven places

Secret name of satan
Known as chavajoh

Of tetragrammaton
