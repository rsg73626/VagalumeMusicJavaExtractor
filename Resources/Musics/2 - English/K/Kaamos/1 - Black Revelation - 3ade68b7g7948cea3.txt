BLACK REVELATION

Forgotten gods,demonic breed
Bringers of chaos seed
Beyond time,beyond sparr
Dwellers of the in-between

Mighty ones,sacrilegious
Desserrating holy ways
Walk unseen,walk supreme
The dogs of darkness
What once whas,again shall be
Yog-sothoth is the key
Ancient times come again
Echoes of a haunting past

Shadows cast,the darkest gates
In the realm of havohei
Depths of hell open wide
Singing praise unto demise

Black revelation
Doomsday incantation
Black revelation
Solemn devastation
Black revelation

Obscure stellar gods
Walking the earth again
Wickedness eyalts itself
Trimphs through darkness
