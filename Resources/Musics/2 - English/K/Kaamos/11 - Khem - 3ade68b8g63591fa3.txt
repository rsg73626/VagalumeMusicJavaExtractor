KHEM

My mouth -
Speaks of death and birth
My word -
Is for every Aeon
Infidel -
No seal shall hold my silence
No Curse -
For I am its shadow

Shrines of Khem

I am the venom that entice
I am the venom that Emancipates

Ia Apep, Ia Typhon
Amon Apep, Amon Teth
Ia Apep, Ia Typhon
Amon Apep, Amon Teth

I am the venom that entice
I am the venom that emancipates
