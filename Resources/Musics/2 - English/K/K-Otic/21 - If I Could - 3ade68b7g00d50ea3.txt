IF I COULD

I know it's not easy to find someone you love,
I know it's not easy to really find the one,
But if you find the greatest love of all.

I know it's not easy to let you go,
But I just want you, just wanna let you know,
That it's okay if you want to reach your goal.

I'll be behind you to help you get through
All the hard times you do on your own,
And i will remind you of who you are,
So you will stay as great as I know you.

I'll be behind you,
Through the journey that you make,
I will help you to take decisions of life.
And although it will hurt us,
You should do this as I would,
But I'd keep you here if I could.

Livin' without you creates an emptiness in me,
My life has changed now,
Yeah, it really made me see,
This is a new part, a completely different start.

'cause i just can't let you fly away,
In my heart is where you'll always stay.

I'll be behind you,
Through the journey that you make,
I will help you to take decisions of life.
And although it will hurt us,
You should do this as I would,
But I'd keep you here.

If I could I'd change what is,
So I'd still have what I miss,
I think we both will be just fine.

I'll be behind you,
Through the journey that you make,
I will help you to take decisions of life.
And although it will hurt us,
You should do this as I would,
But I'd keep you here if I could.
