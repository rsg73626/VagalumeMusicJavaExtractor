I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU

How was I supposed to know?
How could I prepare at all?
Not a word and not a sign,
You're fed up with what I am. 
I turn back the time,
And then it's so clear that I had already lost.

I don't understand you,
I can't say I blame you,
I keep telling me I did wrong.
I never had a chance to say,
Whatever could have made you stay,
I keep thinking, 'Have to be strong.'

It's so hard it takes me out,
I am back into square one.
I am sure that you're okay,
With me ending up betrayed.

I turn back the time,
And then it's so clear that I had already lost.

I don't understand you,
I can't say I blame you,
I keep telling me I did wrong.
I never had a chance to say,
Whatever could have made you stay,
I keep thinking, 'Have to be strong.'

Everything seems so unreal,
All my thoughts cannot be told,
I just keep thinking, 'Why?'

I hope that I have found something out,
The next time I know what it's about,
I'll just have to rebuild my mind,
Collect all the parts and combine.

I don't understand you,
I can't say I blame you,
I keep telling me I did wrong.
I never had a chance to say,
Whatever could have made you stay,
I keep thinking, 'Have to be strong.'
