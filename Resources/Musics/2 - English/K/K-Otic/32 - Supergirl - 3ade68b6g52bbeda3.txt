SUPERGIRL

You can tell by the way,
She walks that she's my girl
You can tell by the way,
she talks like she rules the world.
You can see in her eyes,
that no one is her Chain.
She's my girl, my Supergirl

And then she'd say it's OK, I got lost on the way
But I'm a Supergirl and Supergirls don't cry
And then she'd say it's allright, I got home late last night
Cause I'm a Supergirl and Supergirls just fly

And then she'd say, that nothing can go wrong
When you're in love, what can go wrong?
And then she'd dance, the night time into day
Pushing her fears further along

And then she'd say it's OK I got lost on the way
But I'm a Supergirl and Supergirls don't cry
And then she'd say it's allright I got home late last night
Cause I'm a Supergirl and Supergirls just fly

Then she'd shout down the line tell me she's got no more time
Cause she's a Supergirl and Supergirls don't cry
Then she'd scream in my face tell me to leave leave this place
Cause she's a Supergirl and Supergirls just fly

She's a Supergirl a Supergirl
She's sewing seeds she's burning tree
She's sewing seeds she's burning tree
She's a Supergirl a Supergirl
A Supergirl my Supergirl
