DON'T MAKE ME WAIT

You say you don't know,
You say it's not fair,
You got your problems and you don't care,
And you'd be happier without me. 
But if it's so good,
Then maybe we should,
Find a way to make it better.
You wanna fight it out,
And that's alright with me.

You'll see,
You'll be,
More then everything to me,
Why hesitate?

Don't make me wait.
Gotta say if you want me here to stay,
If you're feeling it don't hide it.
Don't you throw this love away,
Don't make me wait.
It can work if we just communicate,
'cause I want you here beside me.
Baby, don't you make me wait.

So make up your mind,
'cause I don't have time,
To search for something that you can't find,
And if you think it's wrong then I will walk away.

No blame,
No games,
But it don't have to be this way,
Why hesitate?

Don't make me wait.
Gotta say if you want me here to stay,
If you're feeling it don't hide it.
Don't you throw this love away,
Don't make me wait.
It can work if we just communicate,
'cause I want you here beside me.
Baby, don't you make me wait.

Does it have to be so complicated?
Should be as simple as we make it.
I don't wanna be the one to throw it all away.
Why d'you always try to find a reason,
Not to make this happen?
You should be the one who's asking me to stay.

Don't make me wait.
Gotta say if you want me here to stay,
If you're feeling it don't hide it.
Don't you throw this love away,
Don't make me wait.
It can work if we just communicate,
'cause I want you here beside me.
Baby, don't you make me wait.
