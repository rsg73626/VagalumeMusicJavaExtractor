NO PERFECT WORLD

There ain't no perfect world
Trying to find something that don't exist
Maybe I'm that kind of guy
Keeps stumbling 'round on shoes that just don't fit

Bridge:
Finding out the hard way
And now I can say
Believing in a better day
Is making me pay

Chorus:
My mind's got no secrets for me anymore
I'm finding out reasons, I feel more secure
There ain't no perfect world

There ain't no perfect place
You're trying to make the best of what you've got
If you're to quick to turn the page
What you read before you already forgot

Bridge:
Finding out the hard way
And now I can say
Believing in a better day
Is making me pay

Chorus:
My mindâ€™s got no secrets for me anymore
I'm finding out reasons, I feel more secure
I'm breathing, I'm seeing the scene and I know

There ain't no perfect world
There ain't no perfect way
I'd rather be a slave
to my own illusions
and try to find a world of my own choosing

Guitar solo

Bridge:
Finding out the hard way
And now I can say
Believing in a better day
Is making me pay

Choruses out
