MOONLIGHT ON WATER

What's goin on- down on the planet
What's goin on- inside your pretty head
What's life- without a mercedes
And the need- to feel adrenaline rush

Is it better than- moonlight on water
Is it better than- sex on the beach
Think about us- riding wild horses
Think about us- it's not our reach

I'm here for you
No matter wher you go- No matter what you do
I'm here for you
When there's a lonely night- Who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Simple and explain- uncomplicated
I am- for you  I am- for you

Who's gonna be- the competition
Who's next in line- for promotion baby
Everday- the real world is fading
Spinning out- on the wheel of fortune but


Is it better than- moonlight on water
Is it better than- sex on the beach
Think about us- riding wild horses
Think about us- it's not our reach

I'm here for you
No matter wher you go- No matter what you do
I'm here for you
When there's a lonely night- Who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Simple and explain- uncomplicated
I am- for you  I am- for you

You've been working so hard- don't you know it baby
You don't understand- what I want from you
Instead of dreamin- 'bout all that money
We got much- simpler things to do


Is it better than- moonlight on water
Is it better than- sex on the beach
Think about us- riding wild horses
Think about us- it's not our reach

I'm here for you
No matter wher you go- No matter what you do
I'm here for you
When there's a lonely night- Who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Simple and explain- uncomplicated
I am- for you  I am- for you 2x
