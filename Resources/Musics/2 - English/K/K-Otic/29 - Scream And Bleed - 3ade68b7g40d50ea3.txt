SCREAM AND BLEED

It's not easy facing reality,
When your dream has flown away,
Oh baby, it gets hard to see,
That you're not here to stay. 
The radio is only playing love songs,
TV only gives me bad news.

It makes me scream and bleed,
When all the sadness comes together.
Scream and bleed,
Everything starts to matter when you're gone.

They say that time will heal the pain,
And there's no need for those tears,
But I think by the time I've gone insane,
And all the good things changed to fears.

There's no bigger misery than loneliness,
And memory is stained on my heart.

It makes me scream and bleed,
When all the sadness comes together.
Scream and bleed,
Everything starts to matter when you're...

Scream and bleed,
When all the sadness comes together.
Scream and bleed,
Everything starts to matter when you're gone.

Ever since you are gone the world looks grey,
Everything I believe is blown away.
There's no structure in this pain.
Everything I do just seems in vain.

Scream and bleed,
When all the sadness comes together.
Scream and bleed,
Everything starts to matter when you're gone.
