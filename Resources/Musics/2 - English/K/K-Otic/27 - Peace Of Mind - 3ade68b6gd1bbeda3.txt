PEACE OF MIND

Looking through the tears, in a distant memory
Raising shadows above, are they haunting me?
But do they know, they hurt 'cause
When I'm lying here alone thinking about what used to be
I don't wanna live my life alone, so unbreak these chains that
Used to hold you and me

Chorus:
But there must be an answer,
To this broken heart of mine
I'm seeking to find
Some peace of mind

Have you ever seen the darkest side of life before
Or does that same old dream
Haunt you wherever you go
But there must be a remedy
To heal what's broken inside of me

Chorus

Just give me the answer
That I can't find

Bridge

I can't believe that there's nothing we can do
No I can't believe that there's nothing left to say

Chorus
