WHEN YOUR HEART IS CONNECTED

In this world of illusions
Nothing stays the same
In the land of confusion
The heart is not to blame
When the dreams turned to sorrow
And the hero walks away
There a reason why he's leaving
There's a reason why you stay

Chorus
When your heart is connected
The writings on the wall
You're always protected
Love will never ever stall
Call on emotions
And place them in my hands
When your heart is connected
Love will stay the same


When you walk disillusioned
Down the highway of hope
Blinded by the shadows
Running out of rope
So you cant make decisions
You let him slip away
There's a reason why he's leaving
There's a reason why I say

Chorus

In the world of illusions
