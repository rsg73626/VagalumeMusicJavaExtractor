CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY MIND

verse 1

Must be some other way
Must be something to say
There's no doubt you are changing
You're slipping away

It's been hard and I know
We have a long way to go
But I'll say it again - I love you so
Let me show...
There is something that I want you to know

chorus

Can't get you out of my mind
I'm not the easiest kind
I know I've done you wrong
Just wanna say - I'm sorry

Love was so easy and then
How could I hurt you again
Been acting like a fool
Just wanna say - I'm sorry

verse 2

I have asked you to stay
Nothing moved you this way
I gave you my heart
Don't throw it away

Please, don't say it's too late
Take your time, I can wait
Let me show you again - I love you so
let me show...

chorus

middle 8

No easy explanation
We've lost communication
You're not the same - and I'm to blame

My love is here, just take it
No fool for love could brake it
So just take it

Can't get you out of my mind
Oh Precious, say you'll be fine
Can't get you out of my mind
Oh Precious, say you'll be fine

chorus
