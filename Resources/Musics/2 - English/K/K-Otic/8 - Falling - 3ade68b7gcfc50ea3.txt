FALLING

I'm fallin',
Wish I wouldn't be,
'cause I hate the sound when you break me. (x2)
Sound when you break me.

Don't know what it was,
That made me turn around,
Can't find a way to forget you.
I don't know what it is,
That makes me act the way I do.

Got a thing for you don't what to do,
To get you out of my mind, (outta my mind)
Out of my head, (outta my head)
Before you've got me falling.

I'm fallin',
Wish I wouldn't be,
'cause I hate the sound when you break me.
Something keeps me falling back again.
I'm fallin',
Wish you wouldn't see,
The way through me so easily.
Fallin' all over again. (2x)

Now I'm giving in,
I'm gonna let you win,
'cause I got no defences.
Take your shot at me,
While you can. (while you can)

She know me too well,
I'm an easy game,
'cause I'm outta my mind, (outta my mind)
Outta my head, (outta my head)
I'm down on my knees, girl.

I'm fallin',
Wish I wouldn't be,
'cause I hate the sound when you break me.
Something keeps me falling back again.
I'm fallin',
Wish you wouldn't see,
The way through me so easily.
Fallin' all over again. (2x)

Fallin' away too easily,
I'm a sucker for your touch.
Fallin' away too easily,
Sucker for your love.
Fallin' away too easily,
I'm a sucker for your touch.
Fallin' away too easily.

I'm fallin',
Wish I wouldn't be,
'cause I hate the sound when you break me.
Something keeps me falling back again.
I'm fallin',
Wish you wouldn't see,
The way through me so easily.
Fallin' all over again. (3x)
