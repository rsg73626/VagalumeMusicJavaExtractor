WEIGHTLESS

(I'm going to make you weightless.)

I know just what you want,
'cause i've been living inside your dream.
I am all you ever needed,
And more if you want me to.
'cause Ican take you higher.
Come dance with me,
We'll watch the sun come down together,
And I will be your everything.

I'm gonna make you weightless.
I wanna watch you fly to the sky tonight.
I'm gonna make you fearless.
I'll be there when you come to life again.

We'll be careless and free,
Just you and I and no do's an don'ts.
One chance in a lifetime,
To do exactly what you want.
'cause I'm just here for you,
To be all you ever dreamed,
Dreamed that you could be,
And you could be just anything.

I'm gonna make you weightless.
I wanna watch you fly to the sky tonight.
I'm gonna make you fearless.
I'll be there when you come to life again.

You will be weightless,
Be weightless with me.
I wanna watch you fly to the sky tonight. 
I'm gonna make you weightless.
I'll be there when you come into my life again.

I'm gonna make you fly.
I'm gonna take you higher.
Weightless.

You'll be weightless with me,
You'll be fearless with me,
You'll be weightless with me.

I'm gonna make you weightless.
I wanna watch you fly to the sky tonight.
I'm gonna make you fearless.
I'll be there when you come to life again.
