I SURRENDER

Only the strong heart survives,
In troubled times like these.
Searching for some place to hide,
Like emotional refugees.
Whenever I'm lonely,
I know that you're with me. 
To the beating of my heart,
To the warmth within your arms,
I surrender, I surrender.
To this feeling in my blood,
To the forces of your love,
I surrender, I surrender.

Just when we dream what's in the air,
We never dreamed of giving up.
We kept the faith in ourselves,
And in each others love.
Build our defences closer to heaven.

To the beating of my heart,
To the warmth within your arms,
I surrender, I surrender.
To this feeling in my blood,
To the forces of your love,
I surrender, I surrender.

(To the beating of my heart)
(To the warmth within your arms)
(To this feeling in my blood)
(To the forces of your love) 

To the heart that calls my name,
To the one who holds the flame,
I surrender, I surrender.
To this feeling in my blood,
To the forces of your love,
I surrender, I surrender.
