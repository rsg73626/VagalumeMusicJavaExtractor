DAMN (I THINK I LOVE YOU)

For 20 days i’ve been lost in cyberspace
I surf thru the web
To catch up with your trace
And i wonder - who you really are?

I only caught a hasty screenshot
Of your smile
You told me all your hotspots
You really make me wonder -
Do you know who i am?

Breathe me - it’s so exciting
I only wanna know if you’re for real

Damn i think i love you
I think i really love you
Cause i believe you’re the one
Who can make it all come true
I think i really love you
Baby i need you
Yeeeh
Let’S set up a blind date tonight
Yeah yeah yeah yeeeh
Or i‘ll just say goodbye

It’s easy to confess to anonymous victims
But since i got to know you
Boy we’re getting deeper - are we going too far?

We talk about the weirdest thoughts
We’ve got in mind
And share the same desire -
It’s crazy how i found you
Do you know what i mean?
Yeah

Love me - enter my world
I only wanna hold you in my arms

Damn i think i love you
I think i really love you
If you mean what you say you don’t say what you mean ain’t true
I think i really love you
Baby i need you
Whooo
Let’s set up a blind date tonight
Yeeeh
Or i’ll just say goodbye

Yeah

Gently
Drifting
Along with the endless tide

Craving
Crossing
The boundaries where we’ll collide

Damn i think i love you
I think i really love you
If you mean what you say you don’t say what you mean ain’t true
Hey i think i love you
Baby i need you
Let’s set up a blind date tonight
Yeah yeah yeah
