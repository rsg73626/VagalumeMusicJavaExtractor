I WANNA BE THE ONE YOU LOVE

You're entire of the world
when its get you down
when you're flying tru the air and
you're crashing to the ground
when you're searching for the light
it's nowhere to be found
just find me baby

I don't wanne be distranged
every time you're down
i won't ever be the broken wings
that keep you on the ground
but when you start to sing
i will be the sound
just let me baby

(refrein)
I only wanne be the one you love
I only wanne be the one you want
so come and get me baby
let me lose inside your soul
I only wanne be your everything
I wanne be the star in all your dreams
I do anything to be the one you love

Baby you can tell me everything
all the secrets of your heart
you can look inside of me
and see how beautiful you are
i wanne show you everyting
each and every part in me is yours
just take it baby

(refrein)

Let me be the lover
no one to uncover
let me be the one you love
hey baby

(refrein)
(refrein)
