CRYIN'

If I never get to do things my way,
You will never get to know me more than this,
When I can't live out my life.
It's almost like you want me to loose,
Everything I am and want to be,
You're okay, but it's just not me. 
Then she says, "Don't waste my time."
When in fact she's wasting mine.

I don't like your cryin',
When you say you understand.
I bet you're lyin',
It's like I see it in your eyes.
'cause everytime I'm on a roll,
You turn me down.
Now I'm the one who's cryin',
You are always in my way,
When I am tryin',
Oh, you make me weak.

Now I am feeling like a plane without wings,
I'm standing on the runway, want to fly the skies,
I have never flown before.

I know you think you stand beside me,
The thing is that you don't help out at all,
No, no,
You make things up.

Then she says, "Don't waste my time."
When in fact she's wasting mine.

I don't like your cryin',
When you say you understand.
I bet you're lyin',
It's like I see it in your eyes.
'cause everytime I'm on a roll,
You turn me down.
Now I'm the one who's cryin',
You are always in my way,
When I am tryin',
Oh, you make me weak.

If you look inside,
You'll find the answers why I do the
Things you just can't fight, do right.
I will never hide,
Never satisfied until you see me as the saint I am.

I don't like your cryin',
Quit your denyin'.

I don't like your cryin',
When you say you understand.
I bet you're lyin',
It's like I see it in your eyes.
'cause everytime I'm on a roll,
You turn me down.
Now I'm the one who's cryin',
When you say you understand.
I bet you're lyin',
It's like I see it in your eyes.
'cause everytime I'm on a roll,
You turn me down.
Now I'm the one who's cryin',
You are always in my way,
When i am tryin',
Oh, you make me weak.
