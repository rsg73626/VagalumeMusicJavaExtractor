HAPPY

There's a man sittin' down by the 405
Hittin' some kind of tune on his ravin' guitar
He seems stranded in a dessert of a million dreams
Just like life hasn't been exactly as nice as it seems

Hello ! How are you ?
Why are you looking so sad on a day like this ?
Do you feel like talking ?
Now you got me started
I wanna see a smile upon your clueless face - Yeah Yeah

You could be so happy - yeah you got somebody to love
You could be so happy - ain`t that good enough
Ain't no use to sit and drag it on, thinking 'bout the mess
you've done - nothing's wrong, just bring it on

You could be so happy - eey you got somebody to love
Nanananana...
Nanananana...

You could be so happy - on this brand new beautiful day
You could be so happy - like kids gettin' ready to play
Come on and bring it on, on and on
Nothing that you do is wrong
Come along and don't drag it on

You could be so happy - aint that good enough?
Ain't no use to sit and drag it on, thinking 'bout the mess
you've done - nothing's wrong, just bring it on

You could be so happy - yeah you got somebody to love

I see a man sittin' down by the 405
Got a smile on his face thinkin': 'What a wonderful life'
