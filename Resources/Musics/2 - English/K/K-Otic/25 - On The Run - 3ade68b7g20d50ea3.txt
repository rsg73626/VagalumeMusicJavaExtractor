ON THE RUN

Let's roll the dice again.
The voice of reason in my head,
It says, "Just let it go.
You've got it coming my friend."
They say I jumped, I got pushed,
There's no way out 'til I've found you. 
We're on the run again,
Driving around like it's all we're living for.
We ride like the wind again,
And we fly, alright.

You don't have to stay awake,
You touch my life, you're home to me,
I'll be there in your hour of need.
Since I've heard 'em call your name,
It triggered something in my mind,
And it's been there all the time.

We're on the run again,
Driving around like it's all we're living for.
We ride like the wind again,
The wide open blue skies all we've been looking for.

Tonight we're guided by the stars up in the sky,
Tonight.

We ride like the wind again,
The wide open blue skies all we've been looking for.
You touch my life, you're home to me.
I'll be there in your hour of need.
