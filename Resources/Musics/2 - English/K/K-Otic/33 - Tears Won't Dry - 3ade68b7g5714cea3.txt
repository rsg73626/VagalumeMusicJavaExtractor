TEARS WON'T DRY

Tears won't dry

Yesterday was tuesday
Had a place to go
I had all I ever need
To satisfy my soul 

Wondering in circles
Wonder who I am
Nothing I would say or do
Will make you understand 

Looking at the ocean
Staring back at me
Think about the things I've done
Wish that I was free 

Maybe I was crazy
Maybe I was scared
Something I don't need to be
This is what I say 

refren':
Now I'm leaving
To say goodbye
Tears won't dry
No'w I'm leaving
To say goodbye
Tears won't dry 

Standing by a crossroad
Need to make a stair
To recognize my destiny
I need a helping hand 

Feeling this connecting
Nothing to embrace
If there is a promised land
Won't you take me away 

refren' 

No I won't, wanna throw it all away
And you say there will be another day
And the sun will be shining over me
Singing me a lullaby 

refren'
