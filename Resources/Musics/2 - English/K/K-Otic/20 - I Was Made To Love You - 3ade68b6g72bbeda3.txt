I WAS MADE TO LOVE YOU

Verse 1
The way our hands fit
The way our eyes meet
The way I melt when you’re holding me
There’s not a piece that’s out of place
I can see the way I feel it’s written on your face
And there is no mistake

Chorus 1
The way I tremble when you touch me
The way I shiver when you say you love me
One kiss and my heart knew
Oh baby I was made to love you
Every hour every minute
With every thought I think you’re in it
Without a doubt I know it’s true
Oh baby I was made to love you

Verse 2
The way I talk
The way you listen
The way you know just what I’m thinking
Long before I even say it
I’ll never understand it and I
Pray it never ends
But I know where it begins

Chorus 2
The way I tremble when you touch me
The way I shiver when you say you love me
One kiss and my heart knew
Oh baby I was made to love you
Every hour every minute
With every thought I think you’re in it
Without a doubt I know it’s true
Oh baby I was made to love you

Bridge
A love this strong isn’t bound by time or space
Anything or place
What’s meant to be will be
I was meant for you, you were meant for me

Chorus 3
The way I tremble when you touch me
The way I shiver when you say you love me
One kiss and my heart knew
Oh baby I was made to love you
Every hour every minute
With every thought I think you’re in it
Without a doubt I know it’s true
Oh baby I was made to love you

The way I tremble when you touch me
The way I shiver when you say you love me
