CALL FOR ME

what do you do when you’re down
when nobody else is around
who’s gonna love you forever
who’s going down for me and you
don’t know what to do
feeling like a fool
playing by the rules

but every day
the world gets stranger to you now
but some things never change
you can always

call for me
where ever you are
oh baby you can
call for me
no matter how far
its crazy
but some say
that love fades away
but you know
where I’ll be
call for me

so many lies you can say
something will give you away
cause nothing lasts forever
except for maybe me and you
tell it like it is
pain and happiness
and I'll be there to share it
like no one ever did
the world seems stranger to you now
but some things never change
you can always

call for me
where ever you are
oh baby you can
call for me
no matter how far
its crazy
but some say
that love fades away
but you know
where I’ll be
call for me

oh I'll be there
when you need someone to talk to
anyone won’t do then
I will be there
When you want someone to long to
I’ll be there
I’m the one to hold you
you don’t have to worry about a thing
baby
you can always

call for me
where ever you are
oh baby you can
call for me
no matter how far
its crazy
but some say
that love fades away
but you know
where I’ll be
call for me
