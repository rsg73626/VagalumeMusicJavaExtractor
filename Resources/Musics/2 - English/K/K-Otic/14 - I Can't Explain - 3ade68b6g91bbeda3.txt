I CAN'T EXPLAIN

Bart:
As the silence the growing
between us seems both you and I know
The words unspoken
The questions hanging in the air now
I can't see how we're getting anywhere

Stefan:
There's aline between love
and something that else we've quietly crossed
The feeling that we
both have lost I'm
not sure we can ever find again

Stefan:
I can't explain
Why love's lost it's glow
and it slipped away
How did it go
I just can't say
My heart leads the way
When to morrow comes
I may be on my way

Bart:
The future that we
Once thought we had turned into a past
Fading fast and
We tried but couldn't make it last and
Watched it  vanish
Now where standing here

Stefan:
I can't explain
Why love's lost it's glow
and it slipped away
How did it go
I just can't say
My heart leads the way
When to morrow comes
I may be on my way

Rachel:
What's nothing
What's something
What's love to you
What's life about
Just being
I'm feeling your soul

Rachel:
I can't explain
Why love's lost it's glow
and it slipped away
How did it go

Bart & Stefan:
I just can't say

Stefan:
My heart leads the way
When to morrow comes
I may be on my way

Rachel:
I can't explain

Bart:
I may be on my way

Rachel:
My heart leads the way

Stefan:
When tomorrow comes
I may be on my way
