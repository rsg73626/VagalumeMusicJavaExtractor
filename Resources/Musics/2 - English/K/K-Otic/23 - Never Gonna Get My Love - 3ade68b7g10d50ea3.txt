NEVER GONNA GET MY LOVE

You are never gonna get my love,
Whatever you're thinking of,
There's something you don't understand,
That I will never let you under my skin,
Never gonna let you in.
Now I'm saving all my love,
'til I find a real man. 
I'm tired of seeing you hanging round,
And you talk a little too loud,
'bout your women and just who you think you are.
Then you ask do I wanna spend some time,
Take a little ride,
Baby, you don't even have a car.

You say I'm the woman of your dreams,
Tell me that you're gonna be so good for me.
Dream on, baby.

You are never gonna get my love,
Whatever you're thinking of,
There's something you don't understand,
That I will never let you under my skin,
Never gonna let you in.
Now I'm saving all my love,
'til I find a real man.

I hear you told your friends a lie,
All about the way I tried to get you to stay the night
Well Idon't like that.
Seems all you wanna do is play,
Not man enough anyway,
To know that there are things you'll never have.

You say I'm forever in your dreams,
How you wanna spend you whole life with me.
Dream on, baby.

You are never gonna get my love,
Whatever you're thinking of,
There's something you don't understand,
That I will never let you under my skin,
Never gonna let you in.
Now I'm saving all my love,
'til I find a real man.

(Never gonna get my love.) (x2)

I'm never gonna let you in,
Now I'm saving all my love,
'til I find a real man.

You say I'm forever in you dreams,
How you wanna spend you whole life with me,
Dream on, baby.

You are never gonna get my love,
Whatever you're thinking of,
There's something you don't understand,
That I will never let you under my skin,
Never gonna let you in.
Now I'm saving all my love,
'til I find a real man.
