I REALLY DON'T THINK SO

Intro

Why does everything have to be a love thing?
Think of all the sorrows that love brings.
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Verse I

You know that I don't back
you doing what you want without you
letting me know that you do...
so I can do it too.

We've been so together,
and if there were ever
reason to change it,
I'm sure we could arrange it, baby.

Something's wrong, if you really think that 
you're the one to get away with it.
I know what you're thinkin', 
it's starting to sink in, why...

Chorus I

Why does everything gotta be a love thing?
Think of all the sorrows that love brings.
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Why does everything gotta be a love thing?
Why can't we dig each other and just hang?
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Verse II

I'm not one to go on
your preconceptions of
correct behaviour.
It's really not my flavour, baby.

Something's wrong, if you really think that 
you're the one to get away with it.
I know what you're thinkin', 
it's starting to sink in, now...

Chorus II

Why does everything gotta be a love thing?
Think of all the sorrows that love brings.
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Why does everything gotta be a love thing?
Why can't we dig each other and just hang?
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Bridge

I don't need a ring on my finger.
I kinda like bein' single.
Commitment don't fit me,
it bit me one time
and I still don't know...

Why does everything have to be a love thing?
Think of all the sorrow that love brings.
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Chorus III

Why does everything gotta be a love thing?
Think of all the sorrows that love brings.
Is it where you really wanna go?
No, I really don't think so.

Is it where you really wanna go?

Why does everything gotta be a love thing?

Ahh-ahh, ah...
Ahh-ahh, ah...
Ahh-ahh, ah...
I really don't think so.
