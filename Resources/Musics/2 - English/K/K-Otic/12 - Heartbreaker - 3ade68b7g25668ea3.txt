HEARTBREAKER

Here i sit all alone,
Thinkin bout what i should have known,
You made me think that i could need you,
You weaved your magic spell and i believed you,
Lookin back on you and me promises that will never be,
I really thought i was your lover,
But now i find im just like any other.

Heartbreaker should have seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker taking my heart and leave me behind,
Heartbreaker could it be just a little more down to me
