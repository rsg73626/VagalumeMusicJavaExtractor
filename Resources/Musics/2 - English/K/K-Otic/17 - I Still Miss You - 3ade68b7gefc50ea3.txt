I STILL MISS YOU

When I'm far away from dreaming,
And think about what I've done,
Is this really me,
Who I always wanted to be?
'cause it's you that I'm loosing,
My everything to me,
Life is so hard when it pulls you down. 
I had to make a choice in my life,
It was the hardest thing to do.
But I still believe in every word I said,
But that doesn't mean that I don't miss you.

And I take each day as it comes my way.
And I don't want to show my tears to the world,
'cause I've been wrong by letting you down so hard,
But try to understand me.

I had to make a choice in my life,
It was the hardest thing to do.
But I still believe in every word I said,
But that doesn't mean,
That I don't miss you,
And the things that you do.
I still miss you,
But there's nothing I can do.
I still miss you, every day, all the time.

When I am far away from dreaming,
And think about what I've done,
Is this really me,
Who I always wanted to be?

I still miss you,
And the things that you do.
I still miss you,
But there's nothing i can do.
I still miss you, every day, all the time.

I still miss you every day,
'cause I need you every day.
Baby, leaving you was the hardest thing to do for me.
