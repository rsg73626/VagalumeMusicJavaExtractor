HOLD ON MY HEART

Hey, hey, hey!
Anybody in this world,
Would have stopped believin'.
Hey, hey, hey!
Any person in their right mind,
Would have stopped breathin'.
And let it all go,
A long time ago. 
But I say, Hey! It's alright!
You've really had a hold on my heart forever.
I say, Hey! It's alright!
I really do believe we belong together.
I say, Hey! it's alright, it's alright.

Hey, hey, hey!
Anybody in this world who has a feelin',
Hey, hey, hey!
Andy person in this universe recievin',
What I found was true,
What I got from you.

But I say, Hey! It's alright!
You've really had a hold on my heart forever.
I say, Hey! It's alright!
I really do believe we belong together.
I say Hey! It's alright, it's alright!
