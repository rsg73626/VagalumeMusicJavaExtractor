GINA

Love always seemed an illusion to me
I could never make things fit
But now that thought turned around
Cause everything feels so right

You see I met you on this big day
I saw your face and got filled with emotion
So now the sky seems a different blue
Cause I know my heart belongs to you

Ohh Gina
Could you look at me once more
Before you walk out of that door
Ohh Gina
Just wanna look you in the eye
Cause I can’t stand sayin’ goodbye

I know it would be hard for us to be
Couldn’t we just give it a shot
But I know your heart must agree
Just wanna love you till the end of time

Ohh Gina
Could you look at me once more
Before you walk out of that door
Ohh Gina
Just wanna look you in the eye
Cause I can’t stand sayin’ goodbye

Don’t know how it’s gonna be
Don’t know what I’ve gotta do
I’m just tryin’ to let you see
That I’m giving this heart to you

Ohh Gina
Could you look at me once more
Before you walk out of that door
Ohh Gina
Come close in my arms tonight
I know that love has never died
Ooh Gina
Just wanna look you in the eye
I just can’t stand sayin’ goodbye
Ohh Gina
Ohh Gina
Ohh Gina
Just wanna look you in the eye
And never ever say goodbye
