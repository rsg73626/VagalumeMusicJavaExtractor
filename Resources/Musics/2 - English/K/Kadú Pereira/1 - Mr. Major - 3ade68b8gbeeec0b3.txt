MR. MAJOR

Went away with the Waves and made me sad
I just wanted to rosemary and cinnamon
to make their days happier
But you chose the waves and I was here, I was here

Left me at the mercy of 13 beaches
Made me walk in the garden of the Gods & Monsters
You made me Scream with your Ultraviolence
Pulled me by the hair and I screamed Salvatore

You were a good sociopath a sweet serial killer
I told you downstairs I had Pepsi Cola taste
And when you said that the head of happiness
tasted like cherry
You screamed wanting our honeymoon

Mr. Major, let's hit and run
Hit and run, let's hit and run

Catch me if you can, working on my tan, salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain: Ciao amore
Salvatore can wait, now it's time to eat soft ice cream
