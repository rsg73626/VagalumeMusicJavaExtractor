A GOOD START

You walk around with my heart in your pocket
You know I'd do anything you ask
Sometimes I sit around and wish this never started
But I know I can't improve on the past

And when you say goodbye
I felt my heart screaming in pain
And when you walked away
I knew I'd never see you again

Girl I lay here on the ground, I'm dust
I reach out for you but you're so far away
You hold the pieces to make me whole again
But you let go somewhere along the way

And when you say goodbye
I felt my heart screaming in pain
And when you walked away
I knew I'd never see you again

You know I'd never lie to you, 
I'll only tell you the truth, only tell you the truth

I'll never write another song about you...
