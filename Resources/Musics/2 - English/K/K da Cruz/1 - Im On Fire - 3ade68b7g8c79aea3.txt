IM ON FIRE

If you wanna sweet sweet love tonight
Call me and I'll make you feel all right
When you are just driving around
Playing games all over town
Turn around, come on down.
I'll be there, yeah, yeah
If you want some sweet sweet love from me
Take a chance with someone new, you see
I can make your fire burn
With the touch or just one kiss
Turn you on all night long.
You'll be gone, gone, gone

Honey now I'm on my way.
I'm on fire (Yes I am my baby)
Honey now I'm on my way.
I'm on fire (I'm in fire baby)
Honey now I'm on my way.
I'm on fire (Yes I am my baby)
Honey now I'm on my way.
I'm on fire (I want fire baby)

If you wanna sweet sweet love tonight
Call me and I'll make you feel all right
When you are just driving around
Playing games all over town
Turn around, come on down. I'll be there, yeah, yeah
