LOVE IS LIFTING ME HIGHER

Love is lifting me higher
Love is lifting me higher 

Love love love 
Is lifting me higher

Take my heart 
It's my desire 
Love love love 
Is lifting me higher 
Take my heart 
It's my desire 
Love love love 
Is lifting me higher 
Take my heart 
And feel the fire

Love is lifting me higher 
It makes me feel good 
Just give me a try to show you 
That my love is right 
Together we can spend the night 
Find the truth me and you 
Keep on trying just don't stop 
Feel the power of my soul 
To get you let it flow 
Come on feel the power 
Of my heart it goes like a shower 
Take me into the sky 
Take my hand and let's fly high 
Show me love  
'Cause I wanna love you  

Love is lifting me higher
My desire in fire
