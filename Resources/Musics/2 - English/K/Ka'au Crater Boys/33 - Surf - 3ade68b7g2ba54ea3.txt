SURF

Surf.......surf 
 
 
Surf is the only way I say 
To make music with the ocean day by day 
I surf all day play music all night 
And I just can't wait till the morning light to go  
 
Surf wooo  wooo  wah oooh 
Surf everybody go surf  wooo wooo wah ooh 
Surf, Surf      
 
I check all the island breaks I know 
But the place I go is the Kaiser Bowl 
I surf with the guys from the Kaiser Surf Crew 
Daddy Mooch, Bob and Dennis too we all 

Chorus 
 
Bridge 
Wamiea, Sunset, Pipeline Haleiwa, Belzy Land 
Bomburas, Rock Piles, Ala Moana and the Kaiser Bowl 
Everybody go 
 
Chorus
 
Once you learn all the radical moves 
I know it will put you in the groove 
Go off the lip and in the tube 
If I can do it so can you.  So go 

Chorus 
 
Surf will never never die 
Cause the feeling makes me fly so high 
My love for surf is very strong 
So the ocean is where I belong.  We go 
 
Chorus
