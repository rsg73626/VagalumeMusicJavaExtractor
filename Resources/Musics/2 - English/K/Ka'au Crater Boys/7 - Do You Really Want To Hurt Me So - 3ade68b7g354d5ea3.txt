DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME SO

I`ve seen the fire burning through your eyes 

I`ve seen the dark clouds overhead 

I`ve seen you cut the deck and roll the dice 

I`ve seen the strange shoes by your bed 
 
Chorus 
	                           
	All I know is that the storm is near,  
	   
	all I know, I`ve got to make it clear 
	
	Do you really want to hurt me so 
	
	Do you really want to let me go 
	
	Do you really want to hurt me so 
	
	I know, I know, I know you don`t mean it 
 

I know your love for me has changed somehow 

So walk the earth and find your soul 

All that I ask of you is forever 

Remember me as loving you 
 
Chorus/Instrumental/2nd verse/Chorus
