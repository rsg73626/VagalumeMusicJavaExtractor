RYTHM OF THE FALLING RAIN

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain 

Telling me just what a fool I've been 
  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain 
 
And let me be alone again 
 
  
The only girl I've ever loved has gone away 

Looking for a brand new start 

Little did she know that when she left that day 

Along with her she took my heart 
 
Bridge 2 
 

Rain please tell me that it's just not fair 

For her to steal my heart away when she don't care 
 
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away 
 
 
Bridge 1/Insrumental/Bridge 2/Bridge 1 

 And let me be alone again 
   
And let me be alone again
