TROPICAL HAWAIIAN DAY

Mountains roll down, to the sea,
  I wish that you were here with me.
The waves are breaking along the shore,
  It`s not the same without you no more

Chorus
               Whoa     Whoa      Whoa     Whoa

Repeat/Chorus


Watch the sun lift off the sea,
  Cast a shadow off a tree.
Soon the surfers will catch the wave,
  The beach will fill with local babes.

Chorus/Repeat/Chorus


Up above the clear blue sky,
The tourist cars come driving by.
Wind surfers across the bay,
  Just a tropical Hawaiian day.

Chorus/Repeat
