I HEAR MUSIC

I hear music, I hear music 
Oh  	 oh  	     oh  
I hear music, I hear music 
Oh  	  oh  	     oh .. 
 
Like to tell someone how to be as one 
They won't come out they won't come out to sing my song 
Mister reggae won't you help me now 
 
To sing a song about today 

(Chorus) 

 Just like birds of a feather, we got to sing together 
    
And spread our love across this lonely land 
	     
We've got to realize, we've got to stop the lies 
	    
We've got to love this land and give it a helping hand 
	     
We've got to love this land and give it a helping hand 
(Chorus)
