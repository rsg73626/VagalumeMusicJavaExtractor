ARE YOU MISSING ME

Are you missing me,      like I miss you. 
                                  
Do you miss the things, we used to do. 
       
Like a stroll on Lover`s Lane, do you still feel the same 
        
Are you missing me,       like I miss you. 
 
       
All our lives we were so happy, but now I`m sad and blue. 
        
Would you like to start all over, and make our dreams come true. 
       
Are you missing me,      like I miss you. 
                                 
Can we still make love and start anew 
    
If you`re not in love with me, like I want you to be, 
         
You're not missing me,      like I miss you. 
 
Solo 
 
Repeat 2nd verse 
  
Are you missing me,     like I miss you
