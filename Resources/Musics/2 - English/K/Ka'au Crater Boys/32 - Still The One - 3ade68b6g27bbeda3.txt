STILL THE ONE

We've been together since way back when,
and sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
That you're still the one I want whispering in my ears.
You're still the one I like to talk to in bed, still the one that turns
my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

Well I look at your face everyday, and I never seen it til it went
away
When winter came, I just wanted to go,
Back to a desert, how I yearned for the snow
You're still the one that makes me laugh, still the one that's
my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one that makes me strong, still the one I wanna
take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one that I love to touch, still the one, and I can't
get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one who can scratch my itch, still the one, and
I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one that makes me shout, still the one that I
dream about
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
