OPIHI MAN

Sounds like thunder,   gotta head for the high ground 
                    
White water coming,   no foolin` around 

Opihi man in the sun.  Opihi man grab your bag and run 

Opihi man another swell is coming your way 
                 
Opihi man another swell is coming your way 
 

Gotta fill up your bag,   with the yellow and black 
                                  
Keep your eye on the wave,   don`t ever turn your back 

Opihi man in the sun.  Opihi man grab your bag and run  

Opihi man another swell is coming your way 
 
Opihi man another swell is coming your way

Like the crab on the rock,   you gotta run real fast 
                                  
Keep your eye on the wave,   don`t ever turn your back 

Opihi man in the sun.  Opihi man grab your bag and run 

Opihi man another swell is coming your way 

Opihi man another swell is coming your way
