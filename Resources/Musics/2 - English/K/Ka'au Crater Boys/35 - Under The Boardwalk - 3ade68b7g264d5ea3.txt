UNDER THE BOARDWALK

When the sun beats down, and melts the tar upon the roof, 
                                                            
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fire-proof. 
          
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, 
                  
On a blanket with my baby, that`s where I`ll be. 
 
      
From the park you`ll hear the happy sounds of a carousel, 
                                        
You can almost taste those hot dogs and french fries they sell. 
      
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, 
             
On a blanket with my baby, that`s where I'll be. 
 
Bridge 
         
Under the boardwalk, out of the sun, 
          
Under the boardwalk, we`ll be having some fun. 
       
Under the boardwalk, people walking above, 
          
Under the boardwalk, we`ll be falling in love, 
      
Under the board-walk, board-walk
