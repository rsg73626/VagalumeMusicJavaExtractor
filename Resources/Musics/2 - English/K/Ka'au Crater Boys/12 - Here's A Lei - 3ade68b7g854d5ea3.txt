HERE'S A LEI

Here's a lei, I give to you 
      
For my feelings, that is true 

Remember the times we had, we had fun 
                        
Those were good and few were bad.     Nooooo 
 

When that lei is blowing swiftly 
                
I think of your hair blowing lightly 
     
When the sun shines in 
         
When the sun shines in 
 
Instrumental 
 

There's a brown spot on that lei 
                    
I'm thinking I don't want to stay 

 Remember that lei I gave to you? 
            
It means farewell 

 I'm going home now, so take care 
         
I'll see you    goodbye goodbye 
   
Goodbye
