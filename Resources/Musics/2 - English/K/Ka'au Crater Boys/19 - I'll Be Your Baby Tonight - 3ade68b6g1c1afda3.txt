I'LL BE YOUR BABY TONIGHT

Close your eyes
Close the door
You don't have to worry, anymore
Cuz I'll be your - baby tonight

Shut the lights
Shut the shade 
You don't have...to be afraid
Cuz I'll be your - baby tonight

Well that mockingbird's gonna fly away
Oh, forget it
The big ol' moon's gonna shine like a spoon
You gonna let it, you won't regret it
Take your shoes off
Do not fear
Bring that bottle... over here
Cuz I'll be your - baby tonight

(uke break!)

Well that mockingbird's gonna fly away
Oh, forget it
That big ol' moon's gonna shine like a spoon
You gonna let it, you won't regret it
Take your shoes off
Do not fear
Bring that bottle... over here
Cuz I'll be your - baby tonight

Cuz I'll be your - baby tonight
Cuz I'll be your - baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight 
(Bruddah)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby tonight)
(Baby...tonight)
Baby tonight (till fade
