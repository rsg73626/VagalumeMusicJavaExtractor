BLACK WATER

Well, I built me a raft and she's ready for floatin' 
      

ol' Mississippi, she's callin' my name 
      

Catfish are jumpin' that paddle wheel thumpin' 
      

Black water keeps rollin' on down to the sea 
      
Chorus 
 
 
Old black water, keep on rollin' Mississippi moon won't you keep on shinin' on me?    
                             
Old black water, keep on rollin' Mississippi moon won't you keep on shinin' on me? 
                            
Old black water, keep on rollin' Mississippi moon won't you keep on shinin' on me?      
        
keep on shinin' your light, gonna make every thing      
             
wo mama, gonna make everything all right 
      
Well I ain't got no worries 'cause I ain't in no hurry at all 
 
Instrumental 
 

If it rains, I don't care, don't make no difference to me 
     
Just take that street car that's goin' up town        
            
Oh yeah, I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland and dance a honky tonk 
            
and I'll be  buyin' everybody drinks all night long 
      
Chorus 
          

I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland, pretty momma gonna and take me by the hand 
             
by the hand, take me by the hand pretty momma, 
         
come and dance with your daddy all night long, I'd like to...Repeat an fade
