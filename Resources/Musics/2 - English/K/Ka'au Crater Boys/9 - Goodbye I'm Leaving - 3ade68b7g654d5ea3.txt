GOODBYE I'M LEAVING

I often think about you baby it makes me want to cry 
						 
and I can't find the words to say for telling you goodbye. 
						   
We've been fighting all the time you know our days are few 
						 
Now I feel I'm strong enough to say these words to you. 
 
Chorus 
	    
Goodbye..I'm leaving you darling, there's to much pain  
	             
There's too much sorrow...goodbye I'm leaving you baby  
	 
Can't take the pain anymore goodbye I'm leaving 
 

I'm tired of these lonely nights that you don't come right home 
					         
I stay up all worried about you and feeling all alone 
							 
I tried so hard to talk things over but you don't understand 
				 	
Cause your mind is occupied with another man. 
 
Chorus 
        
Can't take the pain anymore goodbye I'm leaving 
        
Can't take the pain anymore goodbye I'm leaving
