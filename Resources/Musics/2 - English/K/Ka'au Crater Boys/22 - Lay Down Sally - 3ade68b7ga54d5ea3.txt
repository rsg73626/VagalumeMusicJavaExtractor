LAY DOWN SALLY

There is nothing that is wrong 
				
With wanting you to stay here with me  

I know you got somewhere to go, but, 
					
Why don?t you make yourself at home    and stay with me 
	
Don?t you ever leave 
 
Chorus:
	Lay down Sally,   I?ll rescue you in my arms 
	
	Don?t you think you want someone to talk to 
	 
	Lay down Sally,   no need to leave so soon 
	
        I?ve been trying all night long just to talk to you 
 
 
The sun ain?t nearly on the rise 
			
We still got the moon and stars above 

Underneath the velvet skies, love is all that matters 
	
Won?t you stay with me?  Don?t you ever leave 
 
Chorus 

I long to see the morning light 
			
Coloring in your face so dreamily 

So don?t you go and say goodbye 
 
Cause you can make yourself right home 
 
And stay with me.  Don?t you ever leave 
 
Chorus (2x)
