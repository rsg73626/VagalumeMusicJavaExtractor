YOU DON'T WRITE

You don't write, and I been waitin' for your call
You say you busy, baby, but is that really all
Maybe it's just the loneliness that's driving me insane
When you used to play, or is it just a game

Chorus:
If it's so, then we were meant to be
Then why, oh why, did you go away
And leave me blue...oh
You don't write
No, you don't write

Verse 2: 
You don't write, don't gimme no excuse
Sick and tired of all'a your abuse
So don't say you love me when you're miles and miles away
Cuz when the cat's away, the mice pretend to play

Chorus:
If it's so, then we were meant to be
Then why, oh why, did you go away
And leave me blue...oh
You don't write
Oh, you don't write

(uke break)

Verse 2 (repeat):
You don't write, don't gimme no excuse
I'm sick and tired of all'a your abuse
So don't say you love me when you're miles and miles away
Cuz when the cat's away, the mice pretend to play

Chorus:
If it's so, then we were meant to be
Then why, oh why, did you go away
And leave me blue...oh
You don't write

Me anymore
You hardly call me on the phone
I'm all alone
Won't you come on home
No, you don't write...
No, you don't write
Oh, you don't write...
No, you don't write
