FRIEND OF THE DEVIL

I laid up from Reno I was trailed by 20 hounds 

Didn't get to sleep last night till the morning came around 
 
 
Chorus: 
	
	Set out running but I'll take my time 
	   
	A friend of the devil is a friend of mine 
	    
	If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight 
 

Well, I ran into the levee but devil caught me there 

Took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air 
 
 
Chorus 
 
Instrumental 
 

I got two reasons why I cry each lonely night 

First one's named sweet Anne Marie, she's my heart's delight 

Second one is person with the sheriff on my trail 
      
And if he catches me I'll spend my life in jail 
 

I?ve got a wife in Chino Bay and one in Cherokee 
 
First one says she got my child but it don?t look like me 
 
 
Chorus
