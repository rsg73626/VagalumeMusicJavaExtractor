MAKAHA

There's a place,  on the west side 

Called Makaha,  Makaha yeah. 
 

All the braddahs and sistahs, 

Surfing big waves and hanging around 

Playing music and having some fun 
            
Chorus:
        (At) Makaha,  Makaha yeah 
       
        We're going to Makaha,  Makaha yeah 


It's a really nice beautiful sight 

Breaking morning, noon and night 

Jamming music by the firelight 

Everybody's feeling all right 
 
 
Chorus 
Bridge: 
        
        Canoe surfing,  bullyboards banging everybody around 
 
        Braddah Mel,  Braddah Russ,  Sistah Rel,  Uncle Buff 
 
        Everybody ripping, shredding, jamming on down to 
 
 
 
Chorus 
Instrumental 
 

When the sun goes down 

And I'm not ready to head back to town 

Cause there's a lot of nice people to meet 

We all jamming to the reggae beat 
 
 
Chorus 
 
 

Well it's just about time to go 

I hear this song on the radio 

A place where Rusty and the gang compete 

In Uncle Buffalo's longboard meet
