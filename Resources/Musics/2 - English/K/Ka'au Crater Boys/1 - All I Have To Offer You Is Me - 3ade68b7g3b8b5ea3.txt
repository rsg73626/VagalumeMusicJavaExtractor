ALL I HAVE TO OFFER YOU IS ME

Before you take another step, there¹s something you should know. 
About the years ahead, and how¹ll they¹ll be 
We¹ll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow, 
Cause all I have to offer you is me 
                
There¹ll be no mansions waiting on a hill, no crystal chandeliers, 
And there¹ll be no fancy clothes for you to wear. 
Everything I own is standing here in front for you to see, 
Cause all I have to offer you is me.    
 
You know I¹ll give you all my love in every way I can, 
But make sure that¹s what you want while you¹re still free. 
All the gold I have to offer you is in this wedding band, 
Cause all I have to offer you is me. 
 
There¹ll be no mansions waiting on a hill, no crystal chandeliers, 
And there¹ll be no fancy clothes for you to wear. 
Everything I own is standing here in front for you to see, 
Cause all I have to offer you is me.

But make sure that¹s what you want while you¹re still free. 
All the gold I have to offer you is in this wedding band, 
Cause all I have to offer you is me. 
  
 
There¹ll be no mansions waiting on a hill, no crystal chandeliers, 
And there¹ll be no fancy clothes for you to wear. 
Everything I own is standing here in front for you to see, 
Cause all I have to offer you is me.  

Cause all I have to offer you is me.  
Cause all I have to offer you is me.
