HOUSE AT POOH CORNER

Christopher robin and i walked along
as the branches lit up by the moon
posing our questions to owl and eyore
as our days disappeared all too soon
but i wandered much farther today than i should
and i can't seem to find my way back to the woods

so help me if you can i've got to get
back to the house at pooh corner by one
you'd be surprised there's so much to be done
count all the bees in the hive
chase all the clouds from the sky
back to the days of christopher robin and pooh

winnie the pooh doesn't know what to do
got a honey jar stuck on his nose
now he came to me asking help and advice
and from here no one knows where he goes
so i sent him to ask of the owl if he's there
how to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

so help me if you can i've got to get
back to the house at pooh corner by one
you'd be surprised there's so much to be done
count all the bees in the hive
chase all the clouds from the sky
back to the days of christopher robin and pooh

so help me if you can i've got to get
back to the house at pooh corner by one
you'd be surprised there's so much to be done
count all the bees in the hive
chase all the clouds from the sky
back to the days of christopher robin
back to the ways of christopher robin
back to the ways of pooh
