HONOLULU BABY

Honolulu Baby, where'd you get those eyes 
 
And that dark complexion, I idolize 

Honolulu Baby, where'd you get that style 

And those pretty red lips, and that sunny smile 
 
 
 
Neath palm trees swaying, at Waikiki 

Honolulu Baby, you're the one for me 
  
Neath palm trees swaying at Waikiki 
 
Honolulu Baby, you're the one for me 
 
Instrumental  
 
 
Honolulu Baby, when you start to sway 
 
All the men go crazy, they seem to say 

Honolulu Baby, at Waikiki 
 
Honolulu Baby, you're the one for me 
 
Uke solo 
 
 
Honolulu Baby at Waikiki 
 
Honolulu Baby, you're the one for me 
 
Honolulu Baby at Waikiki 
 
Honolulu Baby, you're the one for me 
 
you're the one for me 
 
you're the one for me
