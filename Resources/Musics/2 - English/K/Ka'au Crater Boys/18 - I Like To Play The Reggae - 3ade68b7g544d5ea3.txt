I LIKE TO PLAY THE REGGAE

Chorus: 
I like to play the reggae, I like to dance to the music 
 
I jam on the rhythm of the reggae 
 
I boogie to the sound of the drum beat      
 
And when I play the reggae music 
 
I feel so good I just can't loose it 
 
It's a different kind of feeling 

You feel the love flowing through the air 
 
(Chorus) 
 
Repeat 1st verse 
 
(Chorus) 
 
(Instrumental) 
 
 
I wake up early in the morning 
 
Looking forward to a sunny day 
 
It doesn't matter come rain or shine 

I got the reggae music on my mind 
 
(Chorus) 
 
Repeat 2nd Verse 
 
(Chorus) 
 
 
I like to play the reggae, I like to dance to the music 
 
I jam on the rhythm of the reggae 

I boogie to the sound of the drum beat 
 
 
 
I love to play a lot of different music 

Sweet music from all generations 

But if there was only one kind of music 

I would hope that it is the reggae
