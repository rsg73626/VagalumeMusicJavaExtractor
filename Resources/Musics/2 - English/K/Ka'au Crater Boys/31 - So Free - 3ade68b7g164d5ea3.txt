SO FREE

I live by the waterside, the sun is good, and the days are fine 

Ocean flow, the sea is kind, and the sky¹s         
so free....so free 
 

Summertime, she¹s stepping right on out 
                        
She¹s looking fine, yes and running ?round 
              
Happy people, what it¹s all about 
      
The sky¹s         
so free....so free 
 

Get up, get on, go out of the city, you don¹t need it, 
just you let it be 
 
Take me, take me, take me to the country, where life¹s
so free....so free
