SHE THINKS I STILL CARE

Verse 1 
 
Just because I asked a friend about her, 
 
Just because I spoke her name somewhere, 
 
Just because I rang her number by mistake today, 

She thinks I still care 
 
Verse 2 
 
Just because I haunt the same old places 
 
Where the memorys of her linger in the air, 
 
Just because I saw her then win all the pieces 
 
She thinks I still care 
 
And If she's happy thinkin' I still need her, 
 
Then let that silly notion bring her tears 

How could she ever be so foolish, 
 
And where would she get such an idea?   

Verse 3 

Just because I ask a friend about her, 
 
Just because I spoke her name somewhere, 
 
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be, 
 
She thinks I still care
