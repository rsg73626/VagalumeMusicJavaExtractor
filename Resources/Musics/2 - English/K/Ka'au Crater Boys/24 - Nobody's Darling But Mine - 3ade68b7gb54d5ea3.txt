NOBODY'S DARLING BUT MINE

Come and sit by my side little darling 
         
Come and lay your sweet head close to mine 
 
And promise me that you will never 
     
Be nobody's darling but mine 
 
Chorus 
  
       Be nobody's darling but mine love 
       
       Be honest be faithful and be kind 
    
       And promise me that you will never 
          
       Be nobody's darling but mine 
 
Instrumental 
 

You're as sweet as the flowers in springtime 
   
You're as pure as the dew on the rose 

And I'd rather be somebody's darling 
        
Than a poor boy that nobody knows 
 
Chorus 
 

And promise me that you will never 
 
Be nobody's darling but mine 

Be nobody's darling but mine
