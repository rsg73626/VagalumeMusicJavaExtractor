SIOUX CITY SUE

Verse 1 
   
I drove a herd of cattle down from old Nebraska way 
    
That's how I came to be in the state of I-o-way 
             
In I-o-way I met a gal her eyes were big an blue 
  
I asked her what her name was an she said Sioux City Sue 
       	
Chorus:
	Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue 
	         
	Your hair is red, your eyes are blue 
	            
	I'd swap my horse an dog for you 
	
	Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue 
	        
	There ain't no gal as true  
	                    
	As my sweet Sioux City Sue      
 Verse 2 
  
So I asked her if she had a guy she said yes quite a few, 
  
But still I started courtin my sweet Sioux City Sue 
                            
First time that I stole a kiss, I caught her stealin too 
  
I asked her if she loved me an she said indeed I do
