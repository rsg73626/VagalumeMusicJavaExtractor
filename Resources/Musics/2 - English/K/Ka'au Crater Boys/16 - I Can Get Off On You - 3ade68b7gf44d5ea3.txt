I CAN GET OFF ON YOU

Verse 1 

 Take back the weed take back the cocaine baby 
                                            
 Take back the pills take back the whiskey too 

 I don't need em now because your love is all I was after 
                                           
 I'll make it now because I can get off on you    
 
Chorus:                                 
 I can get by on little or nothing at all, I know 

 I can get high just thinking about you,  and so      

  Repeat Verse 1 
 
 Instrumental (same chords as verse 1) 
 
                                    
 Who'd ever thought this was something that I'd ever do 
 
 Working it out, just mellowing out on you, it's true.  
 
 Repeat Verse 1 
 

 I'll make it I now cause I can get off on you 
 
 I'll make it I now cause I can get off on you
