CHAGES IN LATITUDES, CHANGES IN ATTITUDES

I took off for a weekend last month  
  
Just to try and recall the whole year 
                               
All of the faces and all of the places  

Wonderin' where they all disappeared 
          
I didn't ponder the question too long  
 
I was hungry and went out for a bite 
           
Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum  
       
and we wound up drinkin' all night 
 
Chorus 
             
     With these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes 
  
     Nothing remains quite the same 
         
     With all of our running and all of our cunning  
       
     if we couldn't laugh we would all go insane 
 

Reading departure signs in some big airport  

Reminds me of the places I've been 
                            
Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure  

Makes me want to go back again 
      
If it suddenly ended tomorrow 
        
I could somehow adjust to the fall 

Good times and riches and son of a bitches  
       
I've seen more than I can recall 
 
Chorus/Insturmental/Chorus 
 

I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine 
 
I wish I could jump on a plane 
                       
So many nights I sit an  dream of the ocean  
      
God I wish I was sailin' again 
    
Oh, yesterday's over my shoulder 

I can't look back for too long 
        
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me  
     
And I don't think that I can go wrong      
 
Chorus 
 
   
We were all crazy we would go insane  
  
We were all crazy we would go in - sane
