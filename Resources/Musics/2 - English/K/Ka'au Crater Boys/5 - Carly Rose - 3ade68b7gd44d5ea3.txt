CARLY ROSE

Now there's a little baby her name is Carly Rose 
			    
She is the sweetest thing no matter where she goes 
 
I think of her with tenderness and so much love inside 
		    
She's such a joy and fills me up with pride 
			
And she calls me Kako my little Hawaiian girl 
				
She dances to my music with the cutest ehu curls 
	
When I see her my little darling she always makes my day 
			
A baby thats so precious in each and every way 
(Instrumental)  

He pepe li'ili'i kapa ia o Carly Rose

And she calls me Kako my little Hawaiian girl 
				
She dances to my music with the cutest ehu curls 
	
When I see her my little darling she always makes my day 
			
A baby thats so precious in each and every way 
 
	 
A baby thats so precious in each and every way
