LION

Tell me why you lied, my love
(when I gave you a plan)
Both your eyes are on my heart
After all I've done

But I did what I did
And it's alright
To tell me that you think
It's not right

But you woke the lion up
The lion up
You woke the lion up
Up, up
You wanted fire, burn
Now the lights burn, oh
You woke the lion up
Up, up

Once or twice
You'd change your mind
Once you knew what it's like
Held your pride like all those times
I let go of mine

But I did what I did
And it's alright
If you play the victim
One more time

But you woke the lion up
The lion up
You woke the lion up
Up, up
You wanted fire, burn
Now the lights burn, oh
You woke the lion up
Up, up

So here we are
I'm in your arms
One more time
Say what you will
Another kill
With those lies
Out

But you woke the lion up
The lion up
You woke the lion up
Up, up
You wanted fire, burn
Now the lights burn, oh
You woke the lion up

(up, up)
