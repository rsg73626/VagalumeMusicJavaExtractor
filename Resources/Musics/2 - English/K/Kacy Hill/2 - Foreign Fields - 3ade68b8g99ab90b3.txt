FOREIGN FIELDS

Candles aren't lit yet
We just became friends
Friends again
I drove off my dreams
To make you real again

I hung my flag high
I won't ever forget
Eating my pride
I taste gold on my tongue
See white from my eyes

And when I'm asking for your hand
But you're coming home instead
I'll ask for so much more
Never to leave me again

If I leave this town for Tenn
I'll see mountains again
But if I can't see you
I've lost it all my friend
