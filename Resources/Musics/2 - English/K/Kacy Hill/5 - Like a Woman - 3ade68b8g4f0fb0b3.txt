LIKE A WOMAN

Heart was in an empty space
But falling in love never gave me grace
Spendin' all my time away
Better to want you in retrograde

And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

What makes you make me feel like a woman?
I'm sayin' things that I thought that I wouldn't
And now you cut me, remind me of my beatin' heart
I'll be your Venus if you were my Mars, yeah
What makes you make me feel like a woman?
Speak to me incredibly
Unfolding my arms until I'm in the deep
You bury me shamelessly
And leave me to want inescapably

And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

What makes you make me feel like a woman?
I'm sayin' things that I thought that I wouldn't
And now you cut me, remid me of my beatin' heart
I'll be your Venus if you were my Mars, yeah
What makes you make me feel like a woman? Oh

What makes you make me feel like a woman?
I'm sayin' things that I thought that I wouldn't
And now you cut me, remind me of my beatin'heart
I'll be your Venus if you were my Mars, yeah
What makes you make me feel like a woman? Oh
