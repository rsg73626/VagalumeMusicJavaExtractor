PARTYAHCOLIC

Everybody get this started
There's a party going on right here
Yeah you know my track just charted
So grab me some velvet beer
Like eh

Turn it up up up
You're a partyaholic
From the day to the night you're a partyaholic
Tear it up up up
Like you're a partyaholic
Put your hands up, put your hands up if you're a partyaholic
Like you're a partyaholic
Like you're a partyaholic

Get twisted up in this party
Sweat dripping off my body
Shots got you feeling naughty
You're blaming it on the Bacardi
Like eh
Ladies drop it like eh

Turn it up up up up
You're a partyaholic
From the day to the night you're a partyaholic
Tear it up up up up
Like you're a partyaholic
Put your hands up, put your hands up if you're a partyaholic
Like you're a partyaholic
Like you're a partyaholic
Cuz you're a partyaholic

Yeah, I'm not usually like this

Turn it up up up
You're a partyaholic
From the day to the night you're a partyaholic
Tear it up up up
Like you're a partyaholic
Put your hands up, put your hands up if you're a partyaholic

Turn it up up up
Like you're a partyaholic
Turn it up up up
Like you're a partyaholic
