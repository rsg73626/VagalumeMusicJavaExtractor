TOOL

Lipstick body boy you should join a frat
Crazy night stupid fights grab another pack
Beer bong champion alcoholic rad
You juice for now and make me sick and now you want me back

Drinking and drinking and smoking
And eating and flirting and drinking some more
Got everybody and went to the bar cuz that's what his money was for
Every time we'd go out he'd drink until he'd blackout
No I wont play the fool cuz I know he's just a tool

You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a tool with no value
Ordinary loser
You're just a tool

He was a late night candlelight perfect kinda guy
Sexy and good to me prioritizing right
Respect for me was clear to see knew how to treat me right
Then he messed it up the crown showed his other side

Drinking and drinking and smoking
And eating and flirting and drinking some more
Got everybody and went to the bar cuz that's what his money was for
Every time we'd go out he'd drink until he'd blackout
No I wont play the fool cuz I know he's just a tool

You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a tool with no value
Ordinary loser

You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a tool with no value
Ordinary loser
You're just a tool

A little potty boy
Now all you do is party
Get wasted
You get wasted
Don't call me at 3:30 in the morning

You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a tool with no value
Ordinary loser

You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a t-o-o-l
You're just a tool with no value
Ordinary loser
You're just a tool
