YOU GOT ME

Boy, you got me in the groove, yeah (oh oh ya ya)
Boy, you got me nervous, all up in a spell
I'm digging what you're doing, yeah as
If you couldn't tell
Eyes are locked together, palms are wringing wet
After everything you said, oh yeah, yeah

(You got me) You got me going crazy
(You got me) Boy you got me in the groove,
I'm so into you

You got me, you got me, you got me going crazy
You got me, now what you gonna do

You could take me riding, just don't go to far
You could steal a kiss, boy, when I let down my guard
Just don't keep my waiting, don't start acting shy
Make me yours, I'll make you mine

(You got me), you got me thinkin' more than maybe
(You got me), Going out of my mind, I can't deny

You got me, you got me, you got me going crazy
You got me, now what you gonna do
You got me, you got me, you got me going crazy
You got me, now what you gonna do

My head is spinning, I'm delirious, up in the clouds
I know you know this could be serious
so don't let me down
You got me, you got me

Boy, you got me nervous, all up in a spell
I'm digging what you're doing, yeah as
If you couldn't tell

(You got me) You got me going crazy
(You got me) Boy You got me in the groove,
I'm so into you

You got me, you got me, you got me going crazy
