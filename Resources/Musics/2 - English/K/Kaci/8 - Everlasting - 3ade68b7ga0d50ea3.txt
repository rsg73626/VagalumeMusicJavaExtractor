EVERLASTING

I've had enough of all these stops and starts
It always brings me back to these two hearts
Let's not put it to an end
Baby let's not lose it all again

(Chorus)
Here we are at the start
Of another great adventure to the heart
Will it be everlasting?
Now I know this is real
I've just got to let you know the way I feel
You and me, everlasting

I should have seen the pain I put you through, oh, oh
Forgive me for the things I did to you
And I'm sorry if I let you down
I'll make it up to you this time around

(Chorus)
Here we are at the start
Of another great adventure to the heart
Will it be everlasting?
Now I know this is really real
I've just got to let you know the way I feel
You and me, everlasting

So if you want me, I will be here beside you
Just let it run free 
I know that our love will take us through

You
You and me, everlasting, oh yeah

(Chorus)
Here we are at the start
Of another great adventure to the heart
Will it be everlasting?
Now I know this is really real
I've just got to let you know the way I feel
You and me, everlasting

(Chorus)
(Here we are) Here we are at the start (at the start)
Of another great adventure to the heart (will it be)
Will it be everlasting? (Now I know)
Now I know this is real
I've just got to let you know the way I feel
