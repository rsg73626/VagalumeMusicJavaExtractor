BRING IT ON

Heart beat pounding like a freight train coming like a hurricane
There's nowhere to hide
In the red meat hunker of the concrete jungle this is not a game
They will eat you alive

You got one shot to make it though the night
So you better man up when there's fight or flight

Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Got to bring it on
Got to rob the fight
I will stand alone
After tonight

Bring it on

Line up staring to the dark night looking for the first sign
No time to lose
All thoughts creeping like a sexed up kitten sneaking up behind
Its not up to me or you

You got one shot to make it though the night
So you better man up when there's fight or flight

Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Got to bring it on
Got to rob the fight
I will stand alone
After

I caught a glimps of my reflection now I'm starting to see
Why everybody in the world keeps looking at me
Ive got a sick model body I'm a new kinda breed
And if you think that you can take it go ahead try me

My eyes on fire they're looking at you
You think you got it figured out but you don't have a clue
So keep looking at my ass watch it leave you behind
You think if I was any diff.. it's all in your mind

Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Got to bring it on
Got to rob the fight
I will stand alone
After I bring it on

Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Got to bring it on
Got to rob the fight
I will stand alone
After I bring it on
