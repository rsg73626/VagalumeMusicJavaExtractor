KISS ME CRAZY

Baby I can't take myself away from you
It's absoutely positively what you do
So drive me outta my mind
Before you lead me on one kiss at a time

Come on baby kiss me crazy
Tell me that you miss me baby
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
Kiss me crazy come on baby
Only your two lips can save me
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
(I want you)

My heart is so impatient when I'm here alone
I need more you you so baby hurry home
I can't wait for your touch
It moves me, shakes me
Gives me such a rush

chorus

Baby baby kiss me crazy
Baby baby kiss me crazy
Baby baby kiss me 

You know you drive me outta my mind
So do it to me one kiss at a time
