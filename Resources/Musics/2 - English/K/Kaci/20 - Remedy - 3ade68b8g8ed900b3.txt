REMEDY

You're my remedy

To wake in your arms is all I desire and more
You're a fire that glows where I was hollow before

You're my remedy
Heaven sent to me
When you go away
I can hardly breathe
You're my remedy
You're my sweet escape
From insanity
You're my remedy

And I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
For you my remedy

Day after day the world it can make me so cold
With so many people why do I feel so alone
It all fades away when I see your face
You're linked to me like a melody
Cant you see babe how you heal me

You're my remedy
Heaven sent to me
When you go away
I can hardly breathe
You're my remedy
You're my sweet escape
From insanity
You're my remedy

You're my remedy
Heaven sent to me
When you go away
I can hardly breathe
You're my remedy
You're my sweet escape
From insanity
You're my remedy

And I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
For you
You're my remedy

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
For you

You're my remedy
Heaven sent to me
When you go away
I can hardly breathe
You're my remedy
You're my sweet escape
From insanity
You're my remedy

And I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
For you
You're my remedy

Cuz you're my remedy
