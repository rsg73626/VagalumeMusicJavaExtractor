I THINK I LOVE YOU

Do u think u love me? Ohhheee
Do u think u love me? Ohhhhh
Do u think u love me? Ohhheee
Do u think u love me?

I think I love you!

I’m sleepin at night in the middle of a deep dream
And all at once I wake up
There’s something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
I scream up in my bed
Screamin out the words I dread
I think I love you
Ohh
This mornin I woke up
With this feelin I don’t know how to deal with
So I just decided to myself
Id hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when u walk in to the room

I think I love you

Chorus:
I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I’m afraid that I’m not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I think I love you
Isn’t that what life is made of
So it worries me to say
That I never felt this way

Believe me you really don’t have to worry
I only wanna make u happy
And if u say go away I will
But I think better still  I better stay around and love u
Do u think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face
Do u think u love me

Chorus

Do u think u love me?
Do u think u love me?
Do u think u love me?
Do u think u love me?

Don’t know what I’m up against oh no
Don’t know what It's all about oh no
I got so much to think about… (Think about it)

Chorus to fade
