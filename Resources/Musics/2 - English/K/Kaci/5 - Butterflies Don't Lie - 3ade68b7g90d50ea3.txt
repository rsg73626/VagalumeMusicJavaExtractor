BUTTERFLIES DON'T LIE

You walk by and my heart beats
A thousand times at once it seems
And everytime you look at me 
I have to tell myself to breathe
With just a smile you capture me, and I start to melt
Emotions then take over me like I've never felt 

I could tell my heart each time,
It isn't love, you're just some guy
There's nothing there and what I feel
Is in my head,it isn't real
But I can't deny, can't even try
Cause I know inside, butterflies don't lie

Is there a chance you could be mine
If I let you see inside
Or do you love somebody else
Should I keep this to myself
I could risk a broken heart by telling you the truth
Or I could keep my secret safe and when I see you

I could tell my heart each time
It isn't love, you're just some guy
There's nothing there and what I feel
Is in my head, it isn't real
But I can't deny, can't even try
Cause I know inside, butterflies don't lie

Once again there you are 
Anxiousness, nervous heart
Buttflies fluttering
Can only mean one thing

I could tell my heart each time
It isn't love, you're just some guy
There's nothing there and what I feel
Is in my head, it isn't real
But I can't deny, can't even try
