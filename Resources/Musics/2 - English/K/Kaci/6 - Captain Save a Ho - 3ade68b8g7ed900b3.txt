Vision blurs then you go blind
You think you're something but she's messing with your mind
I bet you think she's a catch
Using daddy's money she's a felenal vixen

She's acting innocent for you but
She's got you looking like a fool
You say that love you fell in
But you fell in hell cant
Save that empty shell hello hello

You better watch out watch out where you go
You better look out captain save a ho
Tonight you better hurry for life
Run away
You better watch out watch out from below
You better look out captain save a ho
Tonight you leave the house alright
Get away

Glamorous bitchy attitude
Boy she makes you feel like you got something to prove
I get why but what you like's a lie
Hollow insecurities are all you're gonna find

You think you're getting something more but
Your standards are aiming for the floor
You think you've got in made but you're chick is a grenade
You better bag your face hello hello

You better watch out watch out where you go
You better look out captain save a ho
Tonight you better hurry for life
Run away
You better watch out watch out from below
You better look out captain save a ho
Tonight leave the house alright
Get away

How low can you go
Confidence on the floor
Pick it up and go
Cuz I don't want no captain save a ho

How low can you go
