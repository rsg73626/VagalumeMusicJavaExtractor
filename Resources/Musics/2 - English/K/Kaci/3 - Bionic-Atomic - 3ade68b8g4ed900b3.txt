BIONIC-ATOMIC

Hello..
I am Model 371
On Earth they call me Kaci

You think that you know but you have no idea
I'm more than what you can see
If you passed me in the street you would not believe it
Till I transform

From galaxy to galaxy I'm running the show
I'm the diamond in the sky
The infinite potential of a star
Light years and beyond discarded angel
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
Now I'm taking over

Lethal and elusive I may live next door
I'm a perfect stranger
I have come to be the one to save the world
From the human nature

I have so much power
I am so much stronger
In the final hour ill be there
I have so much power
I am so much stronger
But you wont know until I transform

From galaxy to galaxy I'm running the show
I'm the diamond in the sky
The infinite potential of a star
Light years and beyond discarded angel
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
Now I'm taking over

I'm your hero
You can watch me fly

From galaxy to galaxy I'm running the show
I'm the diamond in the sky
The infinite potential of a star
Light years and beyond discarded angel
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
Now I'm taking over

I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
And I'm taking over
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
I'm bionic atomic
And I'm taking over

And I'm taking over
