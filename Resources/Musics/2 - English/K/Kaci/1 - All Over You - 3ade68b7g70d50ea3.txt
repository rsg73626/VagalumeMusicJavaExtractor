ALL OVER YOU

Oh no, hey hey
Made up my mind, wasn't gonna do it this time
You called tonight, and suddenly I'm thinkin', oh my
If you're only gonna break my heart again
I don't wanna be the fool who lets you in
Lets you in, can't let you in

Oh no, here I go fallin' in love exactly when I said I wouldn't
Do, do what to do, fallin' in love all over you
Hey, hey big mistake jumpin' back in when I really
knew I shouldn't
Ooh, ohh what to do, fallin' in love all over you

You say you changed, but part of me is saying, no way
I pull away, but I know deep inside, it's too late
Guess I didn't get my heart broke bad enough
Guess I'm finding out that I can't give you up
Can't give you up, can't give you up

Oh no, here I go fallin' in love exactly when I said I wouldn't
Do, do what to do, fallin' in love all over you
Hey, hey big mistake jumpin' back in when I really
knew I shouldn't
Ooh, ohh what to do, fallin' in love all over you

I guess I must be crazy(no doubt about it)
Taking a chance again(so why am I doin' it)
I wanna walk away but my heart keeps
pullin me back in

C'mon Kaci you know he changed
Guys don't change
He said he wouldn't hurt you
but he did
Give him a break
You deserve better
Everyone makes mistakes
maybe he will again
Remember those eyes
Did you hear about last time?
Take him back
Oh no here I go

Oh no, here I go fallin' in love exactly when I said I wouldn't
Do, do what to do, fallin' in love all over you
Hey, hey big mistake jumpin' back in when I really
knew I shouldn't
Ooh, ohh what to do, fallin' in love all over you

Made up my mind
