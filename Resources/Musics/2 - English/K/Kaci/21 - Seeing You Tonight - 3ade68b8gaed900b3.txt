SEEING YOU TONIGHT

In the blue Tv light
From the corner of my eyes
Saw you standing in the doorway once again
Is it strange I never cry
As the days and weeks go by
I keep picking up the phone to catch my breath

The real world sets in
But I cant let the end begin
So I look to the stars and pray they make it right

Wish I may wish I might
Wish I had you here by my side
I'd do anything to bring you back to life
Wish I may wish I might
But I wont wish away my life
And I will make it though the day and I will smile
Cuz I'll be seeing you tonight

From your t-shirt on my floor
To the places where we were
I miss you so much sometimes I talk to you alone

The real world sets in
But I wont let the end begin
So I keep holding on until the darkest hour

Wish I may wish I might
Wish I had you here by my side
I'd do anything to bring you back to life
Wish I may wish I might
But I wont wish away my life
And I will make it though the day and I will smile

And I can face the light
Cuz I'll be seeing you tonight
In my dreams it's you and me just like the old days
We lay around but I was alive until we cry
Then I face the dawn and the lights come on
And it all comes back around
To mock me?

Wish I may wish I might
But I wont wish away my life
And I will make it though the day and I will smile
Cuz I'll be seeing you tonight
I'll be seeing you tonight
