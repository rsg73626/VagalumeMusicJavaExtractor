WATCH ME

I'm in 3d
I'm in 3d

Eyes I guess that they're starting to wander
Are you looking at another
Probably thinking that I'm not enough are you boy
I'm feeling kinda ignored
Maybe you're looking for more
I thought you wanted this girl next door

Some girls got the naughty
Some girls got the money
Some girls got the body
That makes you double take
With me you don't expect what you got coming next
A lesson in respect cuz baby I'm the best so

Watch me jump right out of your dreams
And into your screen
Watch me pop out from magazines
And into 3d

Boy you thought it was over for certain
You thought I was closing the curtain
You didn't know there was an act 1 scene 2
So you didn't know I had a stash
Pulling tricks out of my bag
Surprise I'm the best you'll ever have

Some girls got the naughty
Some girls got the money
Some girls got the body
That makes you double take
With me you don't expect what you got coming next
A lesson in respect cuz baby I'm the best so

Watch me jump right out of your dreams
And into your screen
Watch me pop out from magazines
And into 3d

I see you looking at me sneak a peek and baby its yours
Ooh this is easy
All that she wants and so much more
So watch me, watch me, watch me put on a show

Baby you see
I'm in 3d
Put it on me
Put it on me

Baby you see
I'm in 3d
Put it on me
Put it on me

I'm in 3d
Put it on me

Watch me jump right out of your dreams
And into your screen
Watch me pop out from magazines
And into 3d

I see you looking at me sneak a peek and baby its yours
Ooh this is easy
All that she wants and so much more
So watch me, watch me, watch me put on a show

I got it all babe
