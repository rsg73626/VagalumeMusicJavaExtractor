PARADISE

Could it be the little things you do to me
Feelings that i'm feeling are so new to me
I'm going through so many changes
Nothing ever felt as strange as
How my heart goes crazy, when you look at me

Aaahhh

When I'm with you its paradise
No place on earth could be so nice
Through the crystal waterfall I hear you call
Just take my hand its paradise
You kiss me once I'll kiss you twice
And as I gaze into your eyes, i realize its paradise
Ooohhh yea

Now I know the sweetest dreams can all come true
Cuz I found heaven here on earth when I found you
Its nothing I could ever make up
How I hope I never wake up
Just to find this isn't true reality

When I'm with you its paradise
No place on earth could be so nice
Through the crystal waterfall 
I hear you call
Just take my hand its paradise
You kiss me once I'll kiss you twice
And as i gaze into your eyes, I realize its paradise
Ooohhh

The world around us disappears without a trace
Telling me that I have found the perfect place
Let us stay this way forever 
Deep in love and may I never
Spend another day without you close to
Ohhh Paradise
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Ohhhhhhh

Just take my hand its paradise
You kiss me once I'll kiss you twice
And as I gaze into your eyes I realize its paradise

Just take my hand its paradise
You kiss me once I'll kiss you twice
And as I gaze into your eyes I realize its paradise

As I gaze into your eyes I realize its paradise
oooh yea paradise
oh (its paradise)
ohhh
