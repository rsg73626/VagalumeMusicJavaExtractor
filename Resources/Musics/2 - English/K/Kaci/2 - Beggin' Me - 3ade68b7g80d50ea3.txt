BEGGIN' ME

(3,2,1)
You made the choice you decided to go
I plead and cried, but you still said no
But now I realize that I just don't need you
Don't return beggin' please cause it's
done and we're through
We are just not meant to be
So baby I'm asking you please

Don't come beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
Trying to get to me get to me get to me
You'll start needin' me needin' me needin' me
Don't come beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
You'll run into me into me into me
And you'll start wantin' me wantin' me wantin' me
But there is no you and me you and me you and me
So don't come beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me

I know you though that you had me right there
In the palm of your hand but you just didn't care
Till you looked in your hand and you saw I was gone
Now the tables are turned and I suggest you move on
I am happier now that I'm free
So I'm asking, no telling you please

Don't come beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
Trying to get to me get to me get to me
You'll start needin' me needin' me needin' me
Don't come beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
You'll run into me into me into me
And you'll start wantin' me wantin' me wantin' me
But there is no you and me you and me you and me
So don't come beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me<rap>
gi...gi...give it up cause you know
that I want to have you back back
in my world and I know that I'm
sorry and all that never do it again
if you be my girl
yeh I see you and I want you let me
come back and be your boo
I was playin' you, now I'm prayin' you forgive me
Kaci I'm beggin' you

You threw it away and now you stand here today
Wanting me to forget everyhing you did

(beggin' me)

Beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
Get to me get to me get to me
Needin' me needin' me needin' me
Beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
(You'll run) into me into me into me
(And you'll start) wantin' me wantin' me wantin' me
(But there is no) you and me you and me you and me
(So don't come) beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me

(Don't come) beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
(Trying to) get to me get to me get to me
(You'll start) needin' me needin' me needin' me
(Don't come) beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me
(You'll run) into me into me into me
(And you'll start) wantin' me wantin' me wantin' me
(But there is no) you and me you and me you and me
(So don't come) beggin' me beggin' me beggin' me

Beggin' me
