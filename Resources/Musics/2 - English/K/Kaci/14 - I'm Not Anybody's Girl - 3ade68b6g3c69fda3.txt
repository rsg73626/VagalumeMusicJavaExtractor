I'M NOT ANYBODY'S GIRL

Leaving everything at home
I headed out in the pouring rain
Kept thinkin' bout the two of us
and how we ended up this way
It took you by surprise baby when
I told you yesterday
Cause you never thought that
I could be that strong

And I don't have a second more
I'm gonna waste on you
And you can hate me if you need to

I'm not anybody's girl
And I will not conform
And I won't play that good girlfriend you pushed
around before
I'm not anybody's girl
That's how it's gonna be
Can't tell me what to do or say or who to be
And the only one I'll ever answer to is me

Wasted too much time on analyzing everything I do
Only to figure out that I was wasting time on you
I don't really blame you baby I'm a little guilty too
Cause I never told you, you were wrong

And if you think that you gotta control
me just to be a man
Then baby you will never understand

I'm not anybody's girl
And I will not belong
And there's nothing you can do for me
I can't do on my own
I'm not anybody's girl
That's just the way it is
And I will do exactly what I wanna do
With anyone and anywhere I choose

and I will choose what's best for me
and I will do what comes most naturally
as long as I am free
and when I fall in love again
I'll take a vow to never bend To someone else's vision of me
Cause I'm free

But I'm not anybody's girl
And I will not conform
And I won't play that good girlfriend you pushed
around before
I'm not anybody's girl
And I will not belong
And there's nothing you can do for me
I can't do on my own
Not anybody's girl
That's how it's gonna be
Can't tell what to do or say or who to be
Cause the only one who owns this girl is me
And I will not conform
And there's nothing you can do for me
I can't do on my own...
