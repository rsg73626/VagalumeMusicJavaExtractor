CRAZY POSSESSIVE

I think I’m crazy I think I’m going out of my mind
Call me crazy I thought I saw you touching my guy
Are you crazy maybe I should take you outside and show you crazy
Ooh I got your crazy…

A little hazy maybe I’m just losing my mind
I think your shady I know that you’ve been calling my guy
Are you crazy now I’m gonna take you outside and show you crazy
Ooh I got you crazy…

CH:
Call my man again and I’m a fuck you up and I’m a fuck you up and I’m fuck you up
Touch my man again and I’m a fuck you up and I’m a fuck you up…
And then you call me your best friend
And then you call me your best friend

Verse 2:
Call me crazy but every time that I turn around
You’re on my baby ooh but I’m his lady
Am I possessive just because I’m claiming what’s mine
You’re crossing the line

Why are you constantly calling him up
To pick you up
Let me know now
How can you call me your best friend
Then turn around secretly text him
You call me crazy
Ooh I got your crazy

CH:
Call my man again and I’m a fuck you up and I’m a fuck you up and I’m fuck you up
Touch my man again and I’m a fuck you up and I’m a fuck you up…
Call my man again and I’m a fuck you up and I’m a fuck you up and I’m fuck you up
Touch my man again and I’m a fuck you up and I’m a fuck you up…
And then you call me your best frie nd
And then you call me your best friend

Bridge:
They call me crazy they say I’m crazy
(I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I?)
They call me crazy I think I’m crazy
(I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I?)
Ooh I got your crazy!
