BREAKNECK

On the run, they're after you 
Keep your head, don't come unglued 
There is nowhere you can hide 
From the all-seeing camera's eye 

Scanning every corner 
They track your body heat 
Running like a madman 
There's chaos in the streets 

Watching you- surveillance high tech 
After you- the speed is breakneck!! 
Breakneck!! 

Altered evidence in hand 
Making you a guilty manout to 
Prove your innocence 
A victim of circumstance 

Watching you- the tracers detect 
After you- the speed is breakneck!! 
Breakneck!! 

Almost out of breath 
Cannot stand the pace 
Got to stay one step ahead 
In this race...
