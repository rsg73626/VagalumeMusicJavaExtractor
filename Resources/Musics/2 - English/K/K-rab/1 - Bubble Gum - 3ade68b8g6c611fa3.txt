She's sexy, she's cool

So she likes to get loose

Tonite is going digital 
I want lemonade, watermelon, and orginal 
That's three for you,one for me,one for Jay,one for Skeet 
We heard about you in the streets

And we beat your mouth up like them Yung Money freaks like (bimh) 
Let me be your outside

They call me Skeet a Wee

[Hard Head of BHI] 

Ay Ay 
See I like'em like winterfresh 
Man she so high 
She froze my body stone cold 
I call her Dyntene Ice 

She put chills to me 
So I call her Ice Breaker 
I get the fresh out the pack 
All flavors like Now And Laters 

Round like Lifesavers 
Sweet like Cherry 
Thick hips,big lips 
And so I call her Big Red 

It's K-Rab on the track 
I picked up a Cry Baby 
Then I put her right back 

I like'em sweet like Laffy Taffies 
The taste it never ends 
She share me with her sis 
Call'em the Doublemint Twins 

We stop and go again 
I let Skeet jump in 
Call me the candy man 
I got'em for you and your friends 

[Hook]

Give me that Bubble Gum 
Give me that Bubble Gum 2 times 
I want that Bubble gum
