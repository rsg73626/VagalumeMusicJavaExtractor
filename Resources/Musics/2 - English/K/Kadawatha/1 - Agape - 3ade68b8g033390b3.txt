AGAPE

(Whoa) It keeps going down
Let me know, you're mine
(Whoa) it keeps going down
Let me know, that I'm fine

Moving on the rail of my life
Don't know where it's heading now
Saw my promised land pass me by
It stole my fire

I wanna turn this train around, head back
Regain my fragile pride, but I'm going on

(Whoa) It keeps going down
Let me know you're mine
(Whoa) it keeps going down
Let me know, that I'm fine

(Whoa) It keeps going down
Give me love divine
(Whoa) It keeps going down

Help me know, that I'm fine

My heart and my mind is gone
What's left is this desperate song
I'm singing out to the one, I used to know
I was told about a love divine enough
to break this fall
Let me rest in that, my dearest one

(Whoa) It keeps going down
Let me know you're mine
It keeps going down
Let me know, that I'm fine

It keeps going down
But I know, you're mine
Things are going to be all right
And I know, you're mine... I know, you're mine
