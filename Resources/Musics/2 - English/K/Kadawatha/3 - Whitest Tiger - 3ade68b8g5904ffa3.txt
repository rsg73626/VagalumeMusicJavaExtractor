WHITEST TIGER

There's a story of this little child
She was riding the back of a butterfly when she saw this
Tiger on the ground looking upon her at the sky
The child was scared and flew away but the
Tiger said, hey I wanna be your friend
They didn't meet again that day he said:
They don't now me as I am..

She was sure afraid but she saw the kindness in the tigers eyes
What if they're wrong about him?

I'm the whitest tiger but I won't fall in danger
Yeah im the whitest tiger should I say im sorry?
I never mean to lose it still im the whitest tiger.. around

He ran away from the fields to a cave
To the place where he was born and abandoned and he
Cried himself to sleep because
He didn't have a friend to give him
Love for the one he was for the one he was
And he thought about that child...
Yeah she was scared but her heart was as kind as mine

She was sure afraid but she caught a glimpse of tigers heart
That day what if I trusted him?
