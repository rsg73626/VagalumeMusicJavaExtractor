GONNA STAY

Stuck in the sand
I'm slowly going down
Underground
Oh if you're up above
Replace my heart

Stuck in the trance
Of whys ans whys
That regards confidence
I'm singing abou my thoughts
That stole my soul

Please let me know if they're
Gonna stay
Gonna stay

I am aching inside, I think I'm
Losing it
Losing it

Please let me know if they're
Gonna stay
Gonna stay

I am aching inside, I think I'm
Losing it
Losing it

Stuck in the sand
I'm slowly going down

Underground
Oh if you're up above
Oh if you're up above

Stuck in the trance
Couting all of my friends
That would stand

Oh god I need a cure
For this mania

Embrace my heart

Please let me know if they're
Gonna stay
Gonna stay
I am aching inside, I think I'm
Losing it
Losing it Come on just let me go
I'm not gonna fall out
Come on just let me go
Let me know

Come on just let me go
I'm not gonna fall out
Come on just let me go
Let me go!
