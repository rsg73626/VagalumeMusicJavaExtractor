HUNGRY N LURKIN

[intro]
Uh, ay
I'm just tryna elevate over all this bullshit
You hear me?

[hook]
I be flexin' on purpose
Ho that there make you nervous
Most these niggas too funny feel like
I live in a circus
I got a bitch and she worth it
I know I think for certain
These niggas sleep and I'm workin'
These niggas sleep and I'm workin'
I be flexin' on purpose
I'm out here hungry and lurkin'
How you hate when you hurtin'
Hungry and lurkin', hungry and lurkin'
[verse 1]
I know one thing for certain
I know niggas that servin'
I know bitches that's thirsty
And I ball like I'm kyrie irving
Jumped in the game as a student
Now I feel like the teacher
Check them niggas that's round you
Make sure them niggas ain't leachin'
Came to handle my business
That's the reason you lookin'
Fell in love with my presi's
And now she in that bitch cookin'
I'm in jersey like snooki
Searchin' round for them cookies
On that grind till december
Just hope you niggas remember that

[hook]
I be flexin' on purpose
Ho that there make you nervous
Most these niggas too funny feel like
I live in a circus
I got a bitch and she worth it
I know I think for certain
These niggas sleep and I'm workin'
These niggas sleep and I'm workin'
I be flexin' on purpose
I'm out here hungry and lurkin'
How you hate when you hurtin'
Hungry and lurkin', hungry and lurkin'

[verse 2]
I made that choice to go harder
You ain't loyal, why bother?
Must continue this saga
I learned my ways from my father
I learned my lessons while climbin'
I came in perfect timin'
Now I'm in, I'm like fuck it
But I'm in love with these diamonds
Bitch I'm in love with the shinin'
They want me to fall off
They want me to stop workin'
Bitch they want me to call off
But I'm love with these bitches
And I'm in love with this music
If you ain't know bitch I'm comin'
You better watch how you movin'

[hook]
But I be flexin' on purpose
Ho that there make you nervous
Most these niggas too funny feel like
I live in a circus
I got a bitch and she worth it
I know I think for certain
These niggas sleep and I'm workin'
These niggas sleep and I'm workin'
I be flexin' on purpose
I'm out here hungry and lurkin'
How you hate when you hurtin'
Hungry and lurkin', hungry and lurkin'

[outro]
Let's get it
I'm workin', I'm workin'
Aye
