LYRIC AVE

[intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[verse 1]
First off I am not a rapper
Second off we are not the same
Third thing, all you bitch niggas
On the internet, you should be ashamed
Closet full of alexander wang
Louis loafers, you can say I changed
Louis jacket just to block the rain
Eatin' lobster bisk with some champagne
Rip to bankroll
Shit all day been chasin' bankrolls
I ain't even change, I'm in the same clothes
Young wild nigga these hoes can't expose
Young wild nigga that came in on fleek
Gotta get that lil bitch out my sheets
Uber outside, I see you next week
Mover xl, you know a nigga cheap
Pull up to your function ridin' in
That foreign car
Shawty fuck me off that co-co
Feel like pablo escobar
Ain't no pressure I'ma still accept
Your ass for who you are
Now just hop in my jacuzzi
Lose the panties and that bra
[interlude]
Oh-oh-oh

[verse 2]
Bitch I'm that dope
King of pro tool
I am so rude
Feel like goku
Lunch and no boo
Don't do tofu
Say he know me but I don't know old dude
Why you trippin' man I swear she old news
Stop that bitch and girl you know you mine
Rollin' stone, get my rollie on
Rollin' raw cone, drinkin' red wine
But these niggas still know what's happenin'
I'm not just rappin'
Expressin' my emotions
Through some god damn captions
Ridin' through the city
And I'm god damn packin'
Cause I wish a nigga would nigga
I'm god damn lappin'
On my way baby wish me well
Young nigga finally came out that shell
I'm the motherfuckin' truth bitch
If you can't tell

[hook]
I got my change up
I got my name up
I wish a nigga tried to tell me
That I change up
These bitches dangerous
Fuck me like I'm famous
Bought a brand new foreign
So I had to switch my lane up
Change up
I got my change up, I got my change up
I got my change up
These bitches dangerous
Fuck me like I'm famous
Tell me why you hatin' cause a nigga
Switched his lane up
Let's get it

[verse 3]
Bitch I'm on, they can't help but hate
Round table with a full plate
I be in here, finest night chef
Shoutout (?)
Hand be so swift
Tokyo drift
Now I'm ridin'
Green on me add a thousand dollars
Young nigga got his money pilin'
When I seen a mil bitch I started robbin'

[hook]
I got my change up
I got my name up
I wish a nigga tried to tell me
That I change up
These bitches dangerous
Fuck me like I'm famous
Bought a brand new foreign
So I had to switch my lane up
Change up
I got my change up, I got my change up
I got my change up
These bitches dangerous
Fuck me like I'm famous
Tell me why you hatin' cause a nigga
Switched his lane up
Let's get it

[outro]
