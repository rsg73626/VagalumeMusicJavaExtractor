DROWNIN' IN BLOOD

[Verse One]
Came in this world with a loaded gun dead in my mouth
I stuck my hand off in some shit that I couldn't wash off
I need a brother, not a nigga, cuz a nigga be fraud
I be strivin tryin to make these haters give me my card
I never cried over no bullshit, you weak if you do
Cuz it's always somebody that strugglin harder than you
See back in 92, I would of laughed like it was a joke
If you would of told me that by 99 I'd still be broke
But being broke has kept me motivated, able to strive
I witness mutha fuckers dying around me tryin to survive
Brain stormin when I'm pissed off, dial switched in the rhyme
Infinite levels of deepness cuz I'm rich in the mind
These snakes fucked up my last tape but still it was good
But those bitches better not ever step one foot in my hood
I ain't ashame to say it's hatred, so envision the blood
I can't wait to see you mutha fuckers drownin in blood

[Chorus x2]
I can't wait to see you hoes drownin in blood
Drownin in blood, drownin in blood
Leavin all my foes face down in the mud
Drownin in blood, drownin in blood

[Verse Two]
Foo's live life defiant, claimin they computers are Y2K compliant
Shit, picture darkness like power lines cut down
Startin a famine, cuz America is shut down
Mutha fuckers runnin wild, killin for a taste
So called technology, ineffective, millions go to waste
Yo, benjamins ain't jack, you work years to get 'em
Now they worthless, you can even take a shit and wipe your ass wit 'em
Some say my life is like Jekel and Hyde
I'm cool in the world but on my tape it's straight homicide
It's like a war, deep inside the mind where murders are fast
I'm like an aggravated hurricane inside of a glass
But when I overcome this world, well I'll still need help
Cuz when I beat them hoes I'll still have to fight for myself
I ain't ashame to say it's hatred, so envision the blood
I can't wait to see you mutha fuckers drownin in blood

[Chorus x2]
I can't wait to see you hoes drownin in blood
Drownin in blood, drownin in blood
Leavin all my foes face down in the mud
Drownin in blood, drownin in blood

[Verse Three]
10 times 10 equals 100 ways to peel 'em
I listen to these rappers but I still don't feel 'em
Jockin cars, rims, and jewelery all on your hand
Ignant ass mutha fuckers need to rap about buying some land
Something to build on, something thats true
Something to live on, that shit you buying is livin on you
You gotta tight ride, you ain't in the roam
But your kids don't want to live up in no car when you gone
You need a legacy, a foundation, something thats clear
So a hundred years from now, people will know you was here
I heard your album, it was jammin, but your words lack powers
You need to think beyond the hood because the world is ours
Raise your mind level, how much shit can one foo smoke up
The planet got broke up when the sleepin giant woke up
If you hate me, I hate you, I got love if you down
I hope we all can touch a billion so them haters can drown

[Chorus x2]
I can't wait to see you hoes drownin in blood
Drownin in blood, drownin in blood
Leavin all my foes face down in the mud
Drownin in blood, drownin in blood
