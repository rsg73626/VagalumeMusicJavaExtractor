ULTIMATE FLOW

[Verse One]
Fillin 'em all, killin a bull, by drillin a hole, willin to skull
And blow torch your asshole when its freezin cold
Stage a raid, invade with a blade, made a killa spade
Still I sprayed and slayed your crusade
Witness a mercenary, vocalist high jacker
Attacker of a weapon packer Voluntary mind cracker
Scandelous vandelous lyricalstry, play by play analyst
Psychological stable staged panelist
Ran a list of every women and man it be, demandin me, handin me
Mental methods that fuck with my sanity, the murderers parasitic
Avalanche starter, harder than froze water
Homicide, kickin hoes the first quarter
Lyrical dose, in risen my brain, trapped in a prison
Caught in a vision, of verbal mack truck collision
Truth and veracity, never diss
None have outlasted me in 2000 cubic foot brain capacity
Mass the readvance, terminology, geology, its part of me biology
All that shit follows me, swallows me up
Mentally burn 'em and eternally shoot 'em
ya feedin, proceedin, tongue bleedin so eternally
Massacre whacker vernacular, quick
I'm articulate smack the shit outta victim
With hard ass boots I kick you with, domination
Every station's facin incarceration
The ??potions ya facin?? of lethal cyanide innovation
Causin wackin enemies attackin and I kept it
lyrical life jacket, terrible acrobatic knife hatchet
Runnin past, I slaps a brotha who jocks us
or knocks us, unmask his ass like ??Mil Mostrus??

[Hook x2]
10 in row, 20 in a row
30 in row, 40 in a row
Ultimate flow

[Verse Two]
Systematically translatin South Park sounds
You aint down with the sound, then you drown underground
Radical, dramatic attic acrobatic, I touch 'em and stomp 'em
And force in his fist, cuz I'm a lastingness arsonist
Brain patterns posess, manipulation of Manson
Mental multiplication, universal expansion
The verbal evolvacle, viscious royce, irresistable
Super vigerous, fillin vocal, invasions are physical
Just me in a balled room, I'm Steven Seagul
I get even wit' y'all, talk shit, now he's not breathin at all
Dedication to victims of a rougher nation
Suicidal somersault, psychological suffocation
Thoughts for better y'alls, hyperthetic theoretic
My system pressures pump, bring a personal paramedic
Decipher the script of this, hieroglyphic hyptnotist
Jelous motherfucker hit my face and it ripped his fist
Equivalent of a brass knuckle brick storm, bullet fighting beast swarm
Verbal Vietnam bomb, bone breaker of lyrics, paralyzed 'em and crushed 'em
Mentally performed brain surgery without touchin 'em
Yo
