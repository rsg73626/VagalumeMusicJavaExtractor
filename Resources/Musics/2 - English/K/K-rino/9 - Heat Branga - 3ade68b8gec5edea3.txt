HEAT BRANGA

[Verse 1:]
K-Rino the rectangular hyper
active genius creator of the rectangular cypher
South Park liver
ass whuppin giver
lyrics cold enough to make a fuckin snowman shiver
I don't listen to country soft rock or heavy metal
rap motherfuckers I take to unimagenable levels
the abductor of fools ridiculous rhyme raper
confiscatin repossesed spirits sell 'em hoes for paper
if push comes to shove that shove gon' lead to shootin [pump pump]
emcees die like ol ass trees I'm up-rootin
a contest I suggest not you gettin split
I battle 5 million sperm in the womb so you ain't shit
all that you can do is hate me your girl can only ride me
I got a microscopic scientist livin inside me who guides me
I'm oldschool to the fullest fool beatboxin and cuts
walkin internet so long I gon tell ya down low on these nuts

[Chorus:]
K-Rino is the motherfuckin heat branga
hard ass bomb dropper ruff beat banga
to yo woman I'm that motherfuckin meat slanga
hands up if you don't give a fuck feel what I'm sayin
K-Rino is the motherfuckin heat branga
hard ass bomb dropper ruff beat banga
to yo woman I'm that motherfuckin meat slanga
hands up if you don't give a fuck feel what I'm sayin

[Verse 2:]
My skills are genetic respect an atomic bomber
trainin started at 6 months of age by battlin my momma
she tought me well [yeah]
and every now and then I shook her
she was hard to beat but by the age of 5 I finally took her
man I'm trippin
but still rippin
subtract the whole by addin hands to heads multiplyin and ass whippin
you're roastin me
knowin you ain't no where close to me
the organ relocator puttin lungs were kidney supposed to be
reverse your parts I put your lips below your waist
give your mouth a shitty taste and glue your asshole to your face
I rise above petty shit and take a leak on it
fuck a lovesong I play a Dolemite tape and smash the freak on it
so hopefully
you might get the flow for me
your sweetest popery openly wreckin motherfuckers vocally
you came at me rhyme after rhyme after rhyme
but like Jordan you brought your ass back one too many times

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Stand in your midst I'm transparent you wonder were I went
calculus trickin a metric chemistry experiment
allows me to vanish
I'm the wrong man to pick out
loose my mind bust in the court room moonwalkin with my dick out
no for sho K-Rino go hard I crush one
like liquor I'm pourin lyrics out my book before I bust one
yeah thats for all the homies that ain't here to witness
the wizard cerebrally scarin these assholes shitless
lets battle for cash but if you're broke i'll take lamps
amps credit cards first borns and food stamps
man you're worse than 7 hundred rude tramps with mood cramps
recruit rappers and run they asses through lyrical bootcamps
disaster
man fuck livin happily ever after
retire my rap-jersey and hang my mic from the rafter
I'm always in a cop's scope [yeah]
like wresteling landin knee first on bastards from off the top rope

[Chorus]
