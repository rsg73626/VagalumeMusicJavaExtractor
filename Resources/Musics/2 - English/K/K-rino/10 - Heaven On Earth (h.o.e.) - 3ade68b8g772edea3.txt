HEAVEN ON EARTH (H.O.E.)

Straight from god a gift to bring calm to the storm
Soft and warm a heaven in human form
Black queen her touch is like energy from the sun
Can't imagine life without her cuz it wouldn't be none
My respect for you seems to increase with time
Blessed to find one who gives me constant piece of mind
Stress free which lets me overcome struggle & grief
A sacred specimen creation beyond belief
Her beautiful conversations like songs from a bird
Hidden power deep enough to move mountains with a word
React as if I ain't seen black women in days
I'm overpowered and phased by sweet feminine ways
Darkness come I find you bring light to the mind
Memories of you rewind time give sight to the blind
Keeping learning about each other it remains new & fresh
Let our souls merge together till we transcend flesh

[Chorus]
It's like heaven on earth when you're around
After all the things we been thru we still down
You show love for me (love for me) when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong
The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby

Ready to face whatever god plans to stay together
God leading the way so we ain't scared to pray together
Whatever you're past holding baby never mind that
Let's take the word relationship and redefine that
Never ever disrespect ya that's the ultimate rule
To curse a woman is to curse your own existence fool
It don't matter if she yella caramel pitch black
I be feeling what you say just thru eye contact
Able to take a man civilize him when he was wild
And reproduce a copy of him in the form of his child
Your like the sun in the daytime and the moon at night
Universal life I see you when my thoughts take flight
& if it's real we gonna step it up when trouble appears
And every second that we spend apart gonna seem like years
My life is gonna be judged by the way that I treat you
Lets start over boo my name is K-rino it's nice to meet ya

[Chorus]
It's like heaven on earth when you're around
After all the things we been thru we still down
You show love for me (love for me) when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong
The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby

Your life story got to be one developed in stages
y'all can't write the same book if you on 2 different pages
Understand it ain't about material stuff
If you don't stimulate her mind then the world ain't enough
She down to earth but if im in the wrong quick to get brave
Knowing how to be submissive without being a slave
Consolation that I'm needing when she feeding my soul
Cast my words into the universe and let them unfold
Anything I'm tryna get done she ready to roll
The most beautiful vision 2 eyes could ever behold
Knowing she will be the one from the second we meet
I strive to elevate and place the universe at her feet
Everyday is mothers day so don't ever forget it
Tryna keep it real and do better by staying committed
From body, soul to mind she Devine by design
Just to keep her safe I'm down to place my life on the line

[Chorus]
It's like heaven on earth when you're around
After all the things we been thru we still down
You show love for me (love for me) when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong
The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby
