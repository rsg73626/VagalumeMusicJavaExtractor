STILL

[Intro]
Murderers gon buss and snitches gon snitch
Enemies still plotting and bitches gon bitch
Cowards gon fold up and soldier's gon rise
G'z keep living on and haters straight die

[K-Rino]
Ain't nothing new under the sun some things still remain
Jackers still poppin' boys at point blank range
Dope fiends still be shooting drugs up they veins
A trick still quick to come up off all his change
Crack still kills blacks but niggaz still slang
Banging ain't bout jack but niggaz still bang
Material mind states and crying over goods
Blacks don't own nothing but dying over hoods
Hypocrites still lie and still ignite wars
Gals still fuck playas for having tight cars
People'll still rather have a ride then a roof
Holdin' around cappin' thinkin' they ass is bulletproof
Money still means more to folks than human life
This boy still thinkin' his partna wouldn't fuck his wife (yea right)
Alcohol still burn & crabs still itch
Motherfuckers make twenty grand and think they rich

[Hook x2]
Murderers gon buss and snitches gon snitch
Enemies still plotting and bitches gon bitch
Cowards gon fold up and soldier's gon rise
G'z keep living on and haters straight die

[K-Rino]
Ain't nothing new under the sun some things remain true
Brothers still go to jail for things they ain't do
Frauds be fakin' out and acting like scrubs
People still drink & get they ass whooped at clubs
A man gon' still fight a virgin still tight
Men still meet women and fuck the first night
Fools still makin' babies giving no cash
And women still filing child support on they ass
Rappers still gettin' fucked over in contracts
Society still don't give a damn about blacks
Money still green and blood is still red
And when a fool gets out of line it's still shed
H-town is wild and them boys is still agg
Crown royal still come in that purple ass bag
People still making love off Eisley brother's tapes
Ballers roll slabs and laws still hate

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
Same game a diff name
Clouds are drawing up by the moon to form rain
Too hard to swallow we still chasin' a dolla
Can't be a real leader till you first learn to follow
I gotta master my lower self still fighting satan
Universal solutions are verbally formulatin'
Contemplatin' my future still writing live rhymes
Still fucking with the girl that fucked over me five times
Boys acting hard but the grave is official
People dying everyday so why you think your ass special
Last days in times
Gotta elevate the mind
Knowledge out there for the taking but we still walkin' blind

[Hook]
