YOU ARE MY PLAN

You're used to carry my mistakes
Courage is all it takes
To show us a new beginning again

I give you all I have right now
I'll revert the bad somehow
You will only see our best 'til then

Don't be afraid, I won't let you down my love, no more
To see you smile is the reason I'm living for

Cause now, you're my plan
I'll do the best I can
I'll take care of you 'til the end
So, let this journey begin

My promises are here to stay
I 'll never be that far away
You can trust, this new man I've became

Don't be afraid


I have a paradise with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
For you
