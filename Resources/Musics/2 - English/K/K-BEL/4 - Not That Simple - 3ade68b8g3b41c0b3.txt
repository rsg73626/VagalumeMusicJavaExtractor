NOT THAT SIMPLE

You know I'm not that simple
I just can't fit unto the rules I don't belong
You know I trust my symbols
I'm always right until somebody prove me wrong

I don't care what people say
I'm not ashamed
I have my style, my way
Is like my only name

Come on now roll the dice
Play the game
Free yourself, loose the chains
And take the fast lane

And feel alive
Get into the vibe
Cut the strings and
Leave the world behind

You know I'm not that simple
I just can't fit unto the rules I don't belong
You know I trust my symbols
I'm always right until somebody prove me wrong

Getaway now
Oh oh oh
Getaway
Oh oh oh

I'm mostly misunderstood
The weird type
A mystery to decode
Wrong or right

And feel alive

(Bridge)
Desires; they come and go
Tomorrow will never know
