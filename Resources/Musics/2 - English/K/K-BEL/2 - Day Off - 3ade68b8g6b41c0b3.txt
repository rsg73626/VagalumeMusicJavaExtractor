DAY OFF

It's not even six
It's crazy, I know
Just Give me a kiss
Cause I gotta go

And hours from now
I will be free
I promise, we'll have some fun
Just you and me

Forget the chores
Hold me tight
Let's lock the doors
And Make love all night
We have our world
Between this walls, yeah
Day off, Day off

Perfect kingdom
Precious moments of freedom
We make magic nonstop
Drinking wine
See you dancing is so divine
Today is my day off

I left my land
Sometime ago
Before I return
I gotta reach my goals

I have your love
To make me strong
To fight, to excel
To survive the storm
Between this walls, yeah
Is my Day off
