TEARS AND PILLS

Just love me twice
For now and then
Maybe in a while
We' ll be no strangers

You have it all, don't forget, when you get wild
You enjoy torture
Play insecure; you're not a child

One wish
We meet again
Set free the pain
No regrets

Tears and pills
An ugly game
Afraid of shame
Who to blame?

Loosing us
In this sick love
Below and above
Was too much
My heart just broke
I still want you
Oh girl it's true

Your love
Is rough
Pure pain, no lust
Your love
Is rough
No faith, no trust

One wish
We meet again
Set free the pain
No regrets

Tears and pills
An ugly game
Afraid of shame
Who to blame?

Loosing us
In this sick love
Below and above
Was too much
My heart just broke
I still want you
Oh girl it's true

Your love
Is rough
Pure pain, no lust
Your Love
Is rough
No faith, No trust

Love won't die, don't suffocate it
You been too jealous
We have to split

Your love
