ARMS OF LOVE

Driving on a road that I've never been
Watching you with me, by far the best scene
I feel so good
The way I never knew I could

Smiling for no reason, I find myself
Lighter as a feather, with every breath
When I'm with you
All my dreams are coming true

Every time you say my name
I touch the sky
Is hard to explain
I want to feel this way
Today and everyday day

By surprise
My only choice is to fly
Always into the arms of love
Now and forever
By surprise
Before I open my eyes
You take me into the arms of love
Now and forever

Welcome to the first day of our new life
Funny, didn't think it would arrive
I fell for you
And I didn't care for clues

Every time you say my name
I touch the sky
Is hard to explain
I want to feel this way
Today and everyday day


By surprise
