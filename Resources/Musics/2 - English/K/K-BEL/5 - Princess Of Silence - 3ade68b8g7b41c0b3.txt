PRINCESS OF SILENCE

Some say that her lips were stilled and frozen
By a love that made her heart grow cold
Somewhere in her eyes I sense some healing
Do I hear a heart still beating slow?

Something in her smile let me know
Beneath the clock of sadness
Lay a ray of hope

Princess of silence
Hear my song
Darkness is slowly
Turning to dawn
My voice will awaken
All you've forsaken
Remember that love lies within, once again

They say she's just a shadow in the moonlight
Dancing with the pain that sealed her fate
Somehow I know I have to reach her
Show that love just takes a little faith

Something in the music of her voice
Like a song I can't remember
But I know I have no choice
