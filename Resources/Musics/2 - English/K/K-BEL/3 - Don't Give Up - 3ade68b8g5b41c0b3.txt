DON'T GIVE UP

I don't know what's right or wrong
I've been gone for long
Still walking like a ghost
Feeling so alone

I'm waking up from dreams
At night my heart bleeds

I always think of you
You're my guiding light
I'm almost there, it's true
I'm still your knight
Hold on to our love

Don't give up
Wait for me
I'm coming home
I'm running don't you see?

Don't give up
Sunday is near
We belong together
Don't you fear
Don't give up

When I'm weak, I see your smile
Everything is all right

When love runs the extra mile
There is no distance far apart
Hold on to our love

Don't give up

Don't have doubts
Every tear I cry
Make me stronger inside
Stay taking to the moon
I promise I'll be back soon
So don't give up
Don't give up
