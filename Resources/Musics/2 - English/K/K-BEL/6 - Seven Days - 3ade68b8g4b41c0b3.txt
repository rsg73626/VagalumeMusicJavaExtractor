SEVEN DAYS

Sometimes I forget the time has gone
I see you in my mind
We only had seven days
Where can I press rewind

When I had you lying in my arms
The universe was mine
There was nothing so divine
So much love, us combined

I'm needing you by my side
This heart of mine can't be divided

If you see me cry
Don't mind I just can't hide
Won't you take me high?
This love of mine is worth a try

Sometimes I just don't want to move
Maybe I can save yesterday
I can see our future now
Somehow I found the way

I'm needing you by my side
This heart of mine can't be divided

If you see me cry
Don't mind I just can't hide
Won't you take me high?
This love of mine is worth a try
