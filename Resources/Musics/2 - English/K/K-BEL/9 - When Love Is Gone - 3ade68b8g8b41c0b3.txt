WHEN LOVE IS GONE

My life, is changing
I'm far away from you
Is hard to explain
We're just dying
Dying

It's hard to see you crying
It's is breaking up my heart
But forcing desires
Is lying
Is lying

When love is gone
There's nothing wrong
This is no winners game
And no one else to blame

We can't avoid the truth
Since the end of June
Things were not the same
Please, pack your freedom
Be happy
Be happy

You deserve the best
You'll find a real love
That you can call your own
Cause nothing in this world can make a heart stay home
Can't Stay home
When love is gone

Cause
When love is gone
It's not right or wrong
This is no winners game
And no one else to blame
When love is gone
We don't belong
No reason to be ashamed
Cause there's no one else to blame


Break
When love is gone
It's not right or wrong
This is no winners game
And no one else to blame
When love is gone
We don't belong
No reason to be ashamed
Cause there's no one else to blame
