WAITING FOR YOU

Look at me
Don't run gypsy
Let me touch
Your mysteries

It's a spell
I'm possessed
With yours lips
I'm obsessed

Waiting for you
Waiting for you

You're temptation
Ring my bell
Drive me crazy
Do it well

You can read
My deeper thoughts
Kiss me here
Unleash the love

Waiting for you
Waiting for you

Waiting for the night
You will be mine
Waiting for the sign
To wake me inside
Waiting for your fire
In my heart
Waiting for heaven
In my arms

Waiting for you
Waiting for you
