MY TIME (FEAT. BRIDGET KELLY)

(chorus: bridget kelly)
And I swear the stars are falling faster then they ever did
And the sun is burning harder then it has before
And the moon is closer to my reach then it has ever been
My time is coming, my time is coming
And the night time plays the sweetest tunes you'll ever hear
A melody that brings me to my knees
And the wind is wild and knocks me down to whisper in my ear
Your time is coming, my time is coming

(verse 1: k koke)
Look, look, who ever would've thought I could achieve this?
Bet my teachers didn't middle fingers when I see ms
58 Longlents, stonebridge estate
I was on the blocks posted for most of my days
Sizzla, conroy, wales and the mandem
Beating off the wall making rhythms with our handem
Running from the law tryna push away the hand ting
Distributing raw cause being poor ain't worth a damn thing
But "staybizzy" is the anthem
I'm tryna buy mommy's house, push her in a mansion
Sweet 16 for my pretty little tantrum
My dreams turned real then they put me in handcuffs
And ever since I've been banged up
Life's been a roller, coaster, mad stuff
Life on the road kept me held up, anchor
It's like I can't float in my boats... plans are
(chorus: bridget kelly)
And I swear the stars are falling faster then they ever did
And the sun is burning harder then it has before
And the moon is closer to my reach then it has ever been
My time is coming, my time is coming

(verse 2: k koke)
Alright look, look, look, it was all a dream
Now they got me up in that magazine
From the block to the roc no scatty things
When my mixtape dropped, I had the effin streets
Now I get paid gwop to write a fresh 16
I made somethin' outta nothin'
Comin' from the bottom where we got to get it poppin'
It really ain't a problem if to do's your only option
I really ain't discussin' what we do to get the dough in
Goin', goin', I gotta keep goin'
I gotta leave poverty and everybody knows it
I gotta see property, I gotta keep it rollin'
But nothing like monopoly, I gotta really own it
Feelin' like b. I, buzzin' like a bee hive
Looking like money every time the honey's see I
Living life bummy ain't for me, no rewind
G I be til they r. I. p. I

(chorus: bridget kelly)
And I swear the stars are falling faster then they ever did
And the sun is burning harder then it has before
And the moon is closer to my reach then it has ever been
My time is coming, my time is coming
And the night time plays the sweetest tunes you'll ever hear
A melody that brings me to my knees
And the wind is wild and knocks me down to whisper in my ear
Your time is coming, my time is coming
