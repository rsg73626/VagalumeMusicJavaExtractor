LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS (FEAT. RITA ORA)

Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
If that means anything

Listen little manner, done told you for the hype thing
I done told you roll life in what it might seem
Where I'm from we do wrong for the right green
But out price can loose your life for some nice things
No nice dreams, just fiends inside veins
No lie, you don't wanna hear my scream
It's cold nights, got us sippin' like an ice drink
My bro light, you gonna hear like lightning
My 4 thug killin' me, imprisoned with the lifeless
Darling listen, can you vision where my mind is?
It's life sick and ... livewire
Friends turns bitch I know you heard about spider
I recommend you take the telly from me
'Cause I've been in it from the start dog,
It's hell in these streets
Once you in it, then you in it, ain't no sailing in beat
Lay down your weapons, ... get money ...

[Chorus]
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
If that means anything
Can we avoid war, search and destroy all
Learn what to live for, if that means anything
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
If that means anything

Defeat flags, looks one, well look a little closer
You just might find this life isn't what you hoped for
of life, and the proof's in the culture
The truth is you die or sit down, no sofa
Prison living is the image you don't know bout
Picture living in this prison and it's so dark
And when you listen you hear whispers from the cold draft
Looking in the mirror, like a sinner with a broke heart
I know it's so hard, I hope it won't last
I know you and you just wanna get your dough fast
But you don't wanna end up dead or stuck behind bars
Time is of the essence and the prison flies past
And die hard kids wanna play with guns
Listen to my voice, can you hear my pain
Before there isn't choice

[Chorus]
Lay down your weapons, weapons to me
That means everything
Can we avoid war, search and destroy all
Learn what to live for, that means
Lay down your weapons, weapons to me
That means everything, that means anything
