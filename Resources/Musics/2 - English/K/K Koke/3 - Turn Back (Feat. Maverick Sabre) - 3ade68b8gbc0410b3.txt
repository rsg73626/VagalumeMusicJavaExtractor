TURN BACK (FEAT. MAVERICK SABRE)

[Chorus ]
I've been living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

Born May 1985
Ten months later, my lickle bro arrived
Raised in the place where it's do to survive
Our mummy shot food to put honey in our hives
I can see the hunger in her eyes
I could see that something wasn't right
She taught me how to wrap and shot my first ticket
She told me watch my back and be smart with it
And I wish that I could take you there
To a place that my brain takes me every day
I can smile but it still won't take the pain away
I can try but remain in this lonely place
From a child I've been raised in the soldier way
Mummy didn't rap, she called us the Crays
No joke she showed us the ways

[Chorus]
I've been living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

Mummy couldn't cope so she turned to drugs
My aunty Tina gave us hope, she was there for us
I was raised on the roads where it's rare to trust
And my heart's been broke, now I'm scared to love
And I might seem closed until I open up
Feel the weight of the struggle I been holding up
Been betrayed by a cuddle and a heartless hug
I drink pain from a bottle 'til my heart feels numb
?Cause I came from the bottom of this bottle of rum
Ain't changed from a young'n, I been stuck in the slums
Grey days up in London, ain't no summer for us
They try'na take Adie but my brother in ?cuffs
And I just came home, this ain't nothing to us
Like the court don't know how a sufferer does
This was poor home grown but mum's love was enough
So I wanna give her more than she's given to us

[Chorus]
I've been living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time


I don't want to feel this
I don't want to see this
I don't want to hurt no more
I don't want to be this
I don't want to feel this
I don't ned to fight this war
?Cause I'm try'na be somebody
There's nothing I feel that can cloud it
I'm try'na be somebody
Need to get on up
Need to get on up now

[Chorus]
I've been living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Living this daily
With no peace
No daydreams to save me
Get high 'cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
