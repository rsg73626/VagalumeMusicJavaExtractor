KIND OF PERFECT

Why don't you talk about it ?
i know there's something on your mind
when you go on and get a cigarrete
i'll be waiting outside
The last few years have been much harder
Then we ever thought they'll be 
I know you hate when i say i'm sorry, But i'm sorry
There was never a point in our Love
That i didn't love you, not a point in our love
I always did, i always will, i always do
Love you still 
I always would
How could i know how ?
Just look at us, baby
We're kind of perfect
