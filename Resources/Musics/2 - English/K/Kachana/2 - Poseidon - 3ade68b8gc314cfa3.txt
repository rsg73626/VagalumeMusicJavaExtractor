POSEIDON

Future unknown, and sword by my side
My men will do battle with valour and pride
Ithaca bids us a last farewell
The blood red sun lures us forth 

Many moons have passed
And still the ocean a void
Mists enshroud us, choking our site
Then voices on the wind
Turn back! Turn back!
Before we're destroyed
The sirens their beauty concealing men's fate
Men, lash my sinful frame to the mast
Lust overwhelms me, this night be our last
Falling in
Temptation destroys me
Mortal sin
My weakness defiles me
Through my veins
Hope is rekindled
From this desperate state
Glory shall be mine
Dashed on the rocks, by the murderous swell
My men have been taken, this watery Hell
Floating for days, resigned to my fate
The sirens have lured me, a fool for their bait
I must be losing my mind
Will I ever awake?
Dragged to the depths, a powerless soul
And then, a glimmer of light
Awake! Awake!
A kingdom unveiled
Deep in the sea
Such riches such glory, heard only in stories
Once a myth, is now before me
Falling in
Temptation destroys me
Mortal sin
My weakness defiles me
Through my veins
Hope is rekindled
From this desperate state
Glory shall be mine
Above, his trident of steel
Astride a magnificent steed
Destroyer of worlds and the shimmering tide
Riches and murder and greed
Poseidon, Lord of the deep
My vow, I keep
To fight, and to serve and to kill for your rule
Our enemies die as they sleep
Falling in
Temptation destroys me
Mortal sin
My weakness defiles me
Through my veins
Hope is rekindled
From this desperate state
Glory shall be mine
