MASTER OF VICE

I am the traveller who comes from your core
I am the voice when you're screaming for more
I am desire, and you'll pay the price
Master and ruler
I am the lord

I'll make you tremble
I feed on your lust
I'll have no mercy
Your body is cursed
Hate me and love me
I'm here for the fight
No one will hear when you scream
In the night

Feel the pain
Nothing to gain
I'll take you down
I am the lord

Dead of night
Give up the fight
Now is the time
I am the lord

Feel the heat
Feel the cold
Fire and ice
I am the master of vice

Feel me inside you
Your god hath no name
Pleading for mercy
While i play my game
Hate me and love me
I'm here for the fight
No one will hear when you scream
In the night

Dead of night
Give up the fight
Now you are mine
I am the lord

Feel the sin
Pulling you in
Flesh over flesh
I am the lord

Feel the heat
Feel the cold
Fire and ice
I am the master of vice

Feel me inside you
Your god hath no name
Pleading for mercy
While i play my game

Answer your cravings
Watch me perform
Touching you there
In the eye of the storm

Dead of night
Give up the fight
Now you are mine
I am the lord

Feel the sin
Pulling you in
Flesh over flesh
I am the lord

Feel the heat
Feel the cold
Fire and ice
I am the master of vice

I am desire, and you'll pay the price
Master and ruler
I am the lord
Of vice
