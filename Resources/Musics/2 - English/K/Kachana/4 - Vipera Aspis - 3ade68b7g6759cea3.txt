VIPERA ASPIS

Armies of Egypt and legions of Rome 
Screaming the terror of war 
Burning their cities and raping their kin 
With only desire for more 

She's watching from distance, she's biding her time 
Playing them all with her eyes 
The lure of her body, the spring of her trap 
The seduction and then 
The demise 

Oh, kill them slow 
Take them down to death on the Nile 
Cos you feed nations' greed 
Men will fall for your flesh and your smile 
When you drain their blood 
Strip them of their power 
Choke their hearts on your poison wine 
Play your game, taste the pain 
Now the world won't forget your name 

Shrouded in mystery and dangerous man 
He wanted an emperor's life 
Fleeing from Caesar she left him to face 
The traitor, the Ides 
And the knife 

She'll sink in her fangs and she'll swallow them whole 
The general becoming the pawn 
For Anthony's pleasure she lay on her back 
There was blood on her hands by the dawn 

Screaming and naked and bleeding inside 
An emperor dead at her feet 
Enemies closing and nowhere to hide 
No longer time to retreat 

Clinging to life and determined to die 
She summons the demon awake 
Embracing the agony into her breast 
Deliver the fangs of the snake 

Oh, kill them slow 
Take them down to death on the Nile 
Cos you feed nations' greed 
Men will fall for your flesh and your smile 
When you drain their blood 
Strip them of their power 
Choke their hearts on your poison wine 
Play your game, taste the pain 
Now the world won't forget your name
