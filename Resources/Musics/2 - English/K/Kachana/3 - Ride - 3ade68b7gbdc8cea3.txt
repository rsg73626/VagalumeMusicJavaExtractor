RIDE

Metal is the black of your heart 
The sign on your weapon of steel 
insignia branded on warrior's breast 
It's only the battle you feel 

Metal drains the blood of your foe 
As we ride to the glory of night 
Blazing a trail through enemies' fields 
They'll die, as we bring them the fight 

Ride 
With sword of gold 
Ride 
Bring young and old 
Ride 
The hour is met 
Ride 
The sun hath set 


Ride 
And claim the night 
Ride 
It's die or fight 
Ride 
The flash of steel 
Ride 
This metal is real 

We will fight forever 
Blood and steel together 
We will bring destruction 

Take the sword of metal 
Feel the blood of metal 
We will live for metal 

Hymns of battle crying 
Unbelievers dying 
Feel the wrath of iron 

You will know my name and 
You will feel the pain and 
I will show you metal 

Ride 
And claim the night 
Ride 
It's die or fight 
Ride 
The flash of steel 
Ride 
This metal is real
