SHANIA TWAIN

We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and
Spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shoppin' every sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Chorus:)
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
It's such a beautiful thing ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when
You get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Repeat chorus)

Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on i know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Repeat chorus)

Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Ka-ching!
