OUT OF CONTROL

The sun is shining
 But I'm feeling bad
 I drink too much
 My nose is red
 
The sun is shining
 But I'm feeling black
 I don't know why
 But there is something in my head
 I'm out of control
 
I'm out of control
 I'm under control
 I'm out of control
 I'm under control
 
The sun is shining
 But it's a rainy day
 The sun is shining
 But it's a rainy day
 
I'm out of control
 I'm under control
 I'm out of control
 I'm under control
 
The sun is shining
 But it's a rainy day
 The sun is shining
 But it's a rainy day
 
I'm out of control
