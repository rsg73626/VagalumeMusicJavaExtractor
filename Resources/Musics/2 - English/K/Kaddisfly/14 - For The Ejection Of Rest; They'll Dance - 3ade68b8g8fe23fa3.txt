FOR THE EJECTION OF REST; THEY'LL DANCE

A couple words,
just letters that are human in denomination
A dumb stare may show either a lack of understanding
or a sign of genius.

Divinity rests in places unseen
Masked by a chance encounter
or an everyday occurrence

As streets divide cities your skin divides all of you
And as cells to the petal of a wilted flower
To soil we return in a… (magnificent rejoice
As for the ejection of rest they’ll dance)

A city on a hill cannot be hidden
So clap your hands, all you nations

You cannot hope to understand someone completely
until you cease to make assumptions about them,
but that will never happen
so (for now) we’ll settle with gentle acquaintances.
