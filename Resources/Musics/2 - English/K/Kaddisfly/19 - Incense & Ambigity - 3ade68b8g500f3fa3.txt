INCENSE & AMBIGITY

:chorus 1:
Come back honestly
We lack everything
But lack of self respect
Lose it for the rest of us

Distant phases fake salvation
In a new found waste of places
Distant faces were once close
But now are blurred by fairy fables
Deceitful benevolent acts cause
Disarray in combinations
And meticulously plotted grey reactions
Cast upon yourself

:chorus 2:
So grip tight your resolve
And fumble together broke intentions
Please give exit to that trite spiteful gift
She seemed to give you

She was first born from a circle of white foam
But came to take you
And has come from far away
Simply to mock us
Justify a lie and fake it
The only one needs more than one
So please don’t set sail from impletion
And reside with second worst
We don’t need a war

:chorus 1:

:chorus 2:

Stories will end as stories begin
And tables can turn
And always will
I long to save you from yourself
Today can never die too soon.

:chorus 2:
