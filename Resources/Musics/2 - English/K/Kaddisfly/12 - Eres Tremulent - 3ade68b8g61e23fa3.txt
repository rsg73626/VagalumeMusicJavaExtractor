ERES TREMULENT

We make the oceans sometimes, our sea
While poised aloft every swell, blindly
we’re in the same boat and we all share the same oars
We still stake our claims at stern, bow, port, or starboard

Just wait for others, holding offers
Make way for mothers, holding daughters
Wait for brothers, holding lovers

we’ll all at once burst from within
waves of light in human skin
Arguing its only life, we’ll live again
above the waves that tears have since formed
unabridged, en masse

We capsize our minds sometimes, by thinking
And throw the world overboard, wondering
If our ship stays divided and we don’t fast together
We will surely lay waste when there is inclement weather
