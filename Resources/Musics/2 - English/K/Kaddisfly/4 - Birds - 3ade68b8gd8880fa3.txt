BIRDS

Yesterday I met someone...


Last night I was inspired
she affected me like sunlight
providing vitamins necessary for survival

Her name was a foreign sky painted in auburn
her voice was the air, enveloping my back, neck and face
her motion was tactiful and engaging

As we said a prayer the night gave us a song
and gave us a voice so we sang along

As the melody closed so did our eyes
the song stole our heart rhythms
though we did not die alone
because we were together

Last night I became overwhelmed by the moon
but it was only her
full of light, full of magic, nurturing the sky

We hung on each note and rested our heads
counting the question marks inside each other's eyes

I waded in, waded out of a golden ocean
but left my body way back in the sea
still her motion was tactful and engaging
