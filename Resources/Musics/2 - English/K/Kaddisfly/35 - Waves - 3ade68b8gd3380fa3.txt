No prophet has ever been
Accepted in his own village

An owl on the hill knows the moon
And clear as a river, like flowers, we bloom
Faster when we're farther from the shade
Before you grow old, don't get snipped and sold

So what about animals
And all the poor starving souls?
Is it really worth our time?
Well, here's the thing with time, oh, oh...

It's our apartment and rent is still
Due even when our skin skips town

An owl on the hill knows the moon
And clear as a river, like flowers, we bloom
Faster when we're farther from the shade
Before you grow old, don't get snipped and sold

Since we all are dealt zero sum hands
We should have a little compassion
But people sure can be incompetent
At understanding this concept

Be offended by the things we've done
Be offended by the shade of our thumbs
Be offended by just where we stand
One day, I swear

No empire has ever been
True to those that helped it begin

An owl on the hill knows the moon
And clear as a river, like flowers, we bloom
Faster when we're farther from the shade
Before you grow old, don't get snipped and sold

They say, they say, they say... change
