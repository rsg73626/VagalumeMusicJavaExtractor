A MESSAGE TO THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY

Left is no more important than right
As right is not undoubtedly the correct way
Distance can be a line
Though the space amid two points is often a sphere

A man can plot evil on his line and win
Though as he traverses the line he discerns
that his way leads to his death
A fate not matched by his opponent
who traveled the distance instead

Flat is a concept that disregards round
And circular nature has us in a linear realization

As those humble in nature will also die
Though will never cease to exist
Not to say there is a correct fashion
But there is a correct line

they say love can move a mountain
they say love there is no other way
I say that its love that made those mountains
I say that love made us human
