SUMMER SOLSTICE

I am the blade of grass
trembling in the breeze
affected by surroundings

I am the lava
whose path nothing can stop
changing the land, for better of for worse

I am the forest
The one being cut down the size
Only the owls know the secrets that I keep

I am the sail
the one standing in awe of the winde
Amazed by the great lengths it carries me

All I see is white
