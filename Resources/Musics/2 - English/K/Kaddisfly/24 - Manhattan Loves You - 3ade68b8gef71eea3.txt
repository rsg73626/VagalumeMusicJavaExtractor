MANHATTAN LOVES YOU

there are some who are walking on 
a tightrope of inevitability, 
wearing a persona sewn with threads of blind reason, 
and cultivating landscapes whose 
erected palisades are fashioned with words, 
delusive cogitation that merely conceals their intendment 
and assures their vainglory 

meanwhile their hearts are failing by association 

as they mold pliable logic and fabricate palatable coincidence 
in hopes of unveiling a unique divine axiom 
which only masks their purpose 

i can only offer one simple solution that’s not biased in any way, 
in order to get what you need, 
you need to take care of those around you. 

Don’t hope to know anything until you know you know nothing, 
Don’t hope to have anything until you’ve given it all away.
