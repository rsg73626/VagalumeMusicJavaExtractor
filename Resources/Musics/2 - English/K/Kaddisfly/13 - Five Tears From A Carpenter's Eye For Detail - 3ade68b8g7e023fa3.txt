FIVE TEARS FROM A CARPENTER'S EYE FOR DETAIL

What is it like? What’s you’re defense?
One of you says look at this glass,
it’s half empty, One of you says
look at this carafe, it is half full
like two nuts in a jar arguing over their origin,
we have insight
to see they are brothers born of the same shell,
cast in (the jar) by fate,

still they bicker like strangers, fight like old friends,
I would like to tell them, hey look at you and him,
will not the same fate overtake both of you?
From the soil you came, and to soil you’ll return.

blast the folly of humans, if only they could see their shell,
still they argue like nuts (stuck) in a jar,
and look to the lid as they kill, claw, and scream,

Madam officer, lord or whoever, are we safe, can you say,
as the sky shouts back, if you want life back,
segregate (relegate) selfish ways
because currently you’re spelling “our lives” without
the r, u, l, e, s and the v, o, i

to find the rules
governing our value of investment in each other,
simply grab the words and read,
and I bet you will lose all your need to scream

sunlight on hillsides, our minds make the matter
as up steps, we’ll climb ethereal ladders
so inscribe in stone a statement of surrender
with a quill forged of light
