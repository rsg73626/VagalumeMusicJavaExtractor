EMPIRE

This is the swiftly tilting planet
Where perfect vision may not offer
The correct point of view; a place where
Right angles may not produce
The correct geometry

By far, a discerning eye is better than a critical mind

We are quiet like birds
With swiftly tilting minds
And wings that are made of humility, yeah
We are quiet like birds
With secrets like butterflies
And we can only fly if we use our wings

Bridges are built to get us from where we are
To where we are going
In order for them to be built in
A decent fashion
We need to believe
In where we are
And where we came from
And where we are going
We're going, we're going...

By far, by far, a humble heart beats a full stomach

We are quiet like birds
With swiftly tilting minds
And wings that are made of humility, yeah
We are quiet like birds
With secrets like butterflies
And we can only fly if we use our wings

Our lives are bridges
We all build bridges
Our lives are bridges
We all build bridges

How big is a rainbow?
How big is a smile?
And can you tell me which weighs more?

Are you scared of what's in your head?
Or the world outside of it?

We are... quiet like birds
With swiftly tilting minds
And wings that are made of humility, yeah
We are quiet like birds
With secrets like butterflies
And we can only fly if we use our wings

Our lives are bridges
We all build bridges
We can all fly if
We'd just believe
