CAMPFIRE

Welcome to your life
You better watch your steps
Well, they could turn to fire
That could sear through your shoes

And through your feet
Move up your legs and eat away your heart until you
You walk a path with love

Then you could be happy
And your feet and head and heart will
Get along comfortably

And you might even breathe easily

Albeit obvious
We hardly seek
But hope to find you there

Makes no difference how hard you try for any
Period of time or length or distance
Under any pressure, in any environment
Walk your path, but, man,
You better watch your step

They'll burst to flames
If you don't pay the ground a bit of respect
And walk your path with love

And thank the air above

Albeit obvious
We hardly seek
But hope to find you there

Albeit obvious
If we don't speak
No one can lend an ear

With anyone
Or with anything
Or underneath a budding tree

No matter how much you've thought
Or how much you've grown
Or how much you've learned
Or how much you think you know

Or how much you've grieved
Or you've forgiven
Or how much you love
You will never know

Albeit obvious
We hardly seek
But hope to find you there

Albeit obvious
We'll never die
We'll merely disappear
