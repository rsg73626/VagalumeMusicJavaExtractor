CRIMSON SOLITUDE

Soledad red, give the trees their key to green,
the color seen

Humans are trees with different leaves,
With differing shades of which each one perceives
And as sight has them think theyâ€™re alone in the breeze..

Evolution precedes the sky
and even the youngest children ask
why do we fight over who owns the sea and stars
when none of them are even ours

we did not bring anything new into the world
and we can take nothing out of it.
