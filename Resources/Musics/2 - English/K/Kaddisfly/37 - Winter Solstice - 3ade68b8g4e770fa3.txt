WINTER SOLSTICE

I am becoming ever more aware
in this hundred odd day of salty air.
Winter is peeking in through the sky
to defeat, for a while, my tepid smile.

In the eventide I have cried alone
as this big pond feels less like a home
than any place that I've ever been
my life defined by the wind.

What a state I'm in.
