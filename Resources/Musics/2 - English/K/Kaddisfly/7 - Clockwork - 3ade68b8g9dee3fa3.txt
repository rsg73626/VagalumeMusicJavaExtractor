CLOCKWORK

Your boundaries
Would have you thinking in segments
Does it hurt to pose the questions
Segments of what?

When you have pieces of something
There must be a whole
Of which the pieces
The pieces are a part, and

They say, "wait for such and such an event to happen,"
Call their bluff

There is not much time left
There is not enough time
Left to be making
These kind of predictions, ha

There is no basis for
These wordly hopes
Are you happy where you are at?
Keep telling yourself that, oh

They say, "wait for such and such an event to happen,"
Call their bluff

After all, the end is the beginning, my friend

Oh, we exist in four...

There are a million points of view
And a billion conversations
But there is only one end;
It will end in one day
There's one reason

We live in three dimensions
But we exist in four, not three, oh...

We exist in four, not three, oh
We exist in four, not three, oh
We exist in four, not three, oh
We exist in four, not three, oh

So sit back
And relax
And grab a cocktail
Oh, grab a cocktail
Grab a drink
