SNOWFLAKES

There was a man rich in the world
He said, "I have saved my money,
So now I'll buy everything I could want,
Then I will lack nothing."

His intentions seemed fair
The same night he died

There's a drought
Inside the human mind
And in the end, the head expands with fear
And lets in light that spills into the holes
Inside the human heart
And once it's found
The heart explodes
And offers us new life

A body's not a home
Free will is not an art
The wind can either help this sail or rip it apart
Show me your cornerstone
It will be the stone
That others cast away, and thus it's deemed unfit
We're not as much a part of Earth as we see fit

There's a drought
Inside the human mind
And in the end, the head expands with fear
And lets in light that spills into the holes
Inside the human heart
And once it's found
The heart explodes
And offers us new life, life, life...

Human experience can be a misleading cartoon(?)
The true nature of things shadows our human (??)

There's a drought
Inside the human mind
And in the end, the head expands with fear
And lets in light that spills into the holes
Inside the human heart
And once it's found
The heart explodes
And offers us new life
