CLOUDS

I like to breathe water
from the clouds
before it turns to rain

its taste is forgiving
and inviting

After all that we've said and done,
the sky still gives us the sun every
morning when we wake up.

So feel privileged that we're the ones,
who are given so much and
yet are so undeserving.

I appreciate when my
skin turns to air.
I am fond of being that weightless.

I appreciate when my lungs are
full of cloud water.
I am thankful for that feeling.
Much like the eyes of an old friend,
I am grateful for that energy.
