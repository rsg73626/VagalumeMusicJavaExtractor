LET WEIGHT BE MEASURED BY MERIT

tonight like any other,
yet sometimes between steps the world speaks,
though few listen.

our sense of time is bound by our sense of being,
and when they look at me what do they see,
(me or everything) in between?

as they laugh at the sky
the sky laughs at them and sighs,
as they ruin their brothers they too
will fall to ruin, speaking of laughter

your wisdom is frustrated and it is soon to be destroyed.
Take a knee before those who have less than yourself

will selfish smiles remain funny as the sky turns to fire?
