SET SAIL THE PRAIRIE

Just one fundamental notion of the sun
Just one notion fundamental to our blood

We’re all perfect, lost in our ways
We’re all worried, and hurting to

Find a hole in the ground and fall through to the stars

Look at my skin it smiles for you
The color of absent minds worn through

In moments past, fragments of a recollection, an utterance

show mercy to those who act in ignorance,
for the simple fact that you too are ignorant.

We are all lost, floating about (in space)
without the love that painted the scene,
drew everything, all of our being (all-ways)
