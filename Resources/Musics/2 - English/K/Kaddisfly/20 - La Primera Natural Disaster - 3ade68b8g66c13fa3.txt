LA PRIMERA NATURAL DISASTER

Fault lines formed through pride
leave no room for the divine
It took seven days for tears to make waves

Don’t stand for nothing and try to
build your name by shaming others
Why would we compete as if on opposite teams
when we are really siblings
High time we change all our minds

Fractions formed our bones and from those
measurements the earth became our home
or in better terms our life’s vacation
don’t take pride in anything that you’ve toiled to achieve
just make love your best friend and enjoy time

Don’t stand for nothing and try to
build your name by shaming others
Why would we compete as if on opposite teams
when we are really siblings
High time we change all our minds

no eye has seen
no ear has heard
no mind has conceived
what has been prepared for those who love
