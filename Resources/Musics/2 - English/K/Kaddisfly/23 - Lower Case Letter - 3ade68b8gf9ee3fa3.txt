LOWER CASE LETTER

I wish people would be kind
I wish the weight of our words
Would weigh more heavily on our ways
But people take and people say
Human discourse has been unsafe
I wish people would be kind
But talk is cheap and flesh is cheap
And anger is becoming
Currency these days

:chorus:
Hands have been dealt
Where cards have spilt
Like empires that have fallen before
And when the earth is flooded
We must not turn away
More than a kind remembrance
We have to leave a flame

I wish people would be kind
I wish the weight of the world
Would weigh more heavily on our ways
Since its ok that people take
They should first give more of what theyâ€™ve made
I wish people would be kind
Since talk is cheap when people speak
They should first place much more worth
With empathy than words

:chorus:

And time can stand still
While time still is being wasted
Remember where we started.

:chorus:
