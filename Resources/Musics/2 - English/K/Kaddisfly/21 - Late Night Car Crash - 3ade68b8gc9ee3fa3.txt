LATE NIGHT CAR CRASH

Broke down and it's hard to relay
The emptiness of fate
Not knowing where to turn
Street lamps seem to guide the way
As if to a better place for now

:chorus:
Headlights blinding
Car crash see nothing

Broke down I wish I could relate
My friends like digging graves
Our sheets stay different shades
Sadly but I can't fill their void
Beaucse I'm just another boy
For you

:chorus:

:chorus 2:
Then you appear from outer space
From clean white sheets
I see your face
Beautiful overwhelmed
You're my life thank you

Could you please send me
That tiny silver shell
So I could lie down and rest
My head for a while
Sorry to seem abrupt but it seems
That there are some things
Just slightly out of reach
Or impossible to find.

:chorus:

:chorus 2:
