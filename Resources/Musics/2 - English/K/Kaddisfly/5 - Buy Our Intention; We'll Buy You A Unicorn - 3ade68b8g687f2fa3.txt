BUY OUR INTENTION; WE'LL BUY YOU A UNICORN

My diction’s for you with your mind for these words
Whether you act in subversion or progress in vast herds
You may find contentment in quarters unseen
Or you may chance upon solace
through an inchoate dream

And all your vices, all your trails, your intention and denial

Everything, means nothing,
without the words, without the meaning
If all you want is all I have, then all you need is all I’ll give
If everyone could understand
then everyone would lend a hand

My address is for you both awash and converged
You with your crowns and your wits for these words
My refrain is for you with your heeds and your hearts
My life is for you as from subsistence we’ll part

And all your laughter, all your style,
synchronistic hands and smiles

If everyone could understand then
everyone would (make amends)
