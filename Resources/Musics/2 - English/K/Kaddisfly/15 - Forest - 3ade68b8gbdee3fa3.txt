FOREST

You are born today
To set sail the prairie
It is our birthday
You are there because you are around
It will be the best day of our lives
It will be the end of it all
Of it all, of it all...

There will be fire
There will be tears
We will be scared
But we will be together
We will not be prepared
But we will have faith

We will be the ones
With our hands raised to the sky

It will be the end of the world
It will be the beginning of it all
Don't let ignorance help you
Ignore your circumstance
Don't, don't be, don't be stubborn

What is sober judgment?
what is unbelief?
What is undying faith?
What's a prophecy?

What has been done?
What have we done to ourselves?

It will be the end of the world
It will be the beginning of it all
Don't let ignorance help you
Ignore your circumstance
Don't, don't be, don't be stubborn

It will be the end of the world
It will be the beginning of it all
Don't let ignorance help you
Ignore your circumstance
Don't, don't be, don't be stubborn

You were born today
To set sail the prairie

You were born today
To set sail the prairie

(There will be fire, there will be tears, we will be scared, but together)

(It will be the end of the world, it will be the birth of it all, oh of it all) [repeated many times]
