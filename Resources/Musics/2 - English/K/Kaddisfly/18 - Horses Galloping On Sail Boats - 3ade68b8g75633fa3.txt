HORSES GALLOPING ON SAIL BOATS

Beneath a flowering ash, or beneath a lonely oak
We will set sail the prairie
We can gallop upon the sea
If you realize what this means

It is now time to open the doors we have closed ourselves
When we realize what this means

We can travel forever this way
(Weâ€™ve committed piracy of our own lives)
