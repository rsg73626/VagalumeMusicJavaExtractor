ACATION ON AN INVISIBLE PLANE

Seasons will rain proportional matter 
As singularity lacks space until itâ€™s forgotten 
Violet light manifests in itself in patterns 
All can be everything when four is left as one 

Five photons, six rays, seven waves, and four falling leaves 

Intrinsic colors cast in infinite shades 
In both cool and warmth as hope remains winter fades 
A transparent reflection as in reflection 
All in clear as love refracts and winter dies 

As you look at my ink from your own point of view 
My words look at you and make judgments as you do
