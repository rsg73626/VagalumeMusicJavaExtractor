THE CALM OF CALAMITY

In the eye of the sky the night bent down and sighed,
And said with a smile, to the wind as it cried:

“your tears form the oceans and as with the tides,
time forms the tears that you cast from your eyes,

your salt forms the land and the earth becomes mortar,
which dictates your path with direction and order,

as rivers lay softly asleep in their beds,
you cry with great plumage from violet to red,

and as you to your sons and as you to your daughters,
I’ll keep gentle watch over earth and its waters,

And as much as you control the ebb and the flow,
And as sure as the currents carve pathways below,
And as swift as the tides rotate from high to low,
That’s as swift as you came and as quickly you’ll go”
