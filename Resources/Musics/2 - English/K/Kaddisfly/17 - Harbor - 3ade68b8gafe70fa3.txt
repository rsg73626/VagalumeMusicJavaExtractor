HARBOR

Here I sit, somewhere in the port of Spain, debating our existence with someone I've never met.


Read this moment like a rubber-band,
let it resonate like the birth of a loved one,
please let your opinions be flexible.

You say you've found the world and that you understand it, complete.
You have only found a dead man.

Understanding is only coming when you dispose of the breathless body.

my words are limited: their meaning is not
our lives are limited: our existence is not

Be aware for your eyes have deceived you,
because everything you can see
is just a piece, a tiny piece, of a letter in an eternal alphabet,
part of a word in a manuscript that never ends.

At this point I'm off on a search to better my tongue,
and for a better description of this state we're all in.

All we need and no more.
