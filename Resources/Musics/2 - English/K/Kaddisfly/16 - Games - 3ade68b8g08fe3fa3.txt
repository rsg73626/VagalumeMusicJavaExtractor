GAMES

Just listen to one thing
We're armed and good to go
And come strapped with next level parables
And blueprints for another dimension

Oh one is better than nothing
A chance for us to show all that we lack
Honesty is honestly the better plan of attack
Come on, man! Honorable intentions!

Oh with all these enigmatic games
We're right back to the start before we know who to blame
And their shits played again and again and again

Just listen to one thing
Every time you open up your eyes
Every angle seems to be another one in disguise
Talent is a difference of opinion

If I could just sell all my thoughts
I think that I could afford
An original idea, perhaps even more
And you better believe I drag on and on and on

Oh with all these enigmatic games
We're right back to the start before we know who to blame
And their shit's played again and again and again

Oh we're always off for an attack
But right back to the start before we know where we're at
And still their shit goes on again and again and again (always)

With all these enigmatic games (always)
Enigmatic games (always)
Enigmatic games (always)
Games (oh)

With all these enigmatic games (always)
Enigmatic games (always)
Enigmatic games (always)
Games (oh)

Oh with all these enigmatic games
We're right back to the start before we know who to blame
And their shits played again and again and again

Oh we're always off for an attack
But right back to the start before we know where we're at
And still their shit goes on again and again and again (always)

With all these enigmatic games (always)
Enigmatic games (always)
Enigmatic games (always)
Games (always)

This song is better than nothing.
