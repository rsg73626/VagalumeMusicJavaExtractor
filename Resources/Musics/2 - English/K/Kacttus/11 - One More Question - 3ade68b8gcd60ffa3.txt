ONE MORE QUESTION

Inside a world full of social conflits,
The greedness has take control
The caos now, is what i breath!
So now it's for real

The cameras get turn on!
Recording what is reality
All the things that, nobody wants

Awful feelings... and illusion
They left behind, another question
Faintful in words, of elections
Just question about the values for another reason

Life ask about
And your fall,
On vip seats
Many wanna see!

Walking down the streets
Nothing has changed
How long do you take,
To notice your mistake.

Walking down the streets
Nothing has changed
Violence and hipocreasy
They set up all your pain!

The same feelings
Has fortified us
Coz we're fighting for justice
The alliance has not breaken up

Our changes...
Is one into a million
So we fight for that
And it wonÂ´t be in vain!
