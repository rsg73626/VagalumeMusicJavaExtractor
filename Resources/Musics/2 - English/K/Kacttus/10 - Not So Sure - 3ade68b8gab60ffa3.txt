NOT SO SURE

Rise up your arms!
Let´s talk about values of your
Lives highlighteds!
Accepting all the alms they give to
You laying the ground!
All defeated, losing your
Control of your life!
And you believe in lies once again...

Tell me how many times
You realize the truth?
Does anything had changed?
Looking around, i´m not so sure!

Get out of line!
The principles are weappons to
Control your whole time!
Control your actions, keeping you
Inert, you won't go!
Fight along us a new dawning might
Come from the dark!
It´s just bilieve the power yourselves...

Tell me how many times
You realize the truth?
Does anything had changed?
Looking around, i´m not so sure!

Not so sure!
Not so sure!

No!
Not so sure!

Tell me how many times
You realize the truth?
Does anything had changed?
Looking around i´m not so sure!
