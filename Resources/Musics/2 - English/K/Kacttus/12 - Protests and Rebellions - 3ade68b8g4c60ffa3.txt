PROTESTS AND REBELLIONS

Entonces dime algo sobre tu sofrimiento
Se vá quedar tranquilo sin prostestar
Su vida no se vá a cambiar

Stop your authority!
I won´t be part of it,
I won´t let they control my actions
And keep me inert!

And all the things we say!
I know they try to hide it
They won´t silence our voices, no way
We will arise!

And tell me something about your sorrow...
They force us angry against the wall
To stop us marching towards,
And protest on the streets for what´e believe!

You don´t know what such a feeling
It´s have our own opinion
Everything seems to be done
And said, but people do not care!

You don´t know what such a feeling
It´s fighting in your rebellion
Don´t be blame once again
So tell the world

I protest!
I protest!
I protest in my own rebellion
I protest... and i´ll protest!

I protest!
I protest!
I protest in my own rebellion
You don´t know what such a feeling,
So don´t be blind again!

When the rage explodes
And hit the status of a wide fury
Then you realize,
There´s an awful truth that must told!

People all around
Realizing that they have another choice,
The spokesman
Is telling all the words…

You don´t know what such a feeling
It´s have our own opinion
Everything seems to be done and
Said but people do not care!

You don´t know what such a feeling
It´s fighting in your rebellion
Don´t be blame once again
So tell the world what we think!
