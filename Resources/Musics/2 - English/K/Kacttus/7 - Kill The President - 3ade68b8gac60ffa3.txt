KILL THE PRESIDENT

In massachussets he gets born
And tried to change the world
It was what he was looking for
And make the world a better place to live

Then we know what was the end
Of a good man,
That tried to change all the shit
And make the a better place to live

Did he change the things?
We just doesn't know!
Did he really chance?
It drove he to die!

Kill the president!
Let he dies...
One more question
Is it alright?

Kill the president!
Let he dies...
Long life to the bad man
That deserves to die...

I know that he tried to change
But they didn´t give here a chance
He tried to change without predent
But they were not interested
And i try to understand all the points
But now, i got no decision
And now, he´s dead,
He´s dead!

Kill the president!
Let he dies...
One more question
Is it alright?

Kill the president!
Let he dies...
Long life to the bad man
That deserves to die...

Yeaaaah!
Wo wo woow
Yeaaaah! yeaah!
It drove he to die!

Kill the president!
Let he dies...
One more question
Is it alright?

Kill the president!
Let he dies...
Long life to the bad man
That deserves to die...

Yeah yeaah!
