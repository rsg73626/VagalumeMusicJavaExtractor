WINNERS AND LOSERS

"anahali becan inoióiaa la kaban anahali oi kenpan tan haliou
olai, anthrui lebpan... jihaad!"

Winners and losers this is all we have in society,
But who can told you what you wanna be
People create names to always classify you
Winner or looser it´s not about your integridy

Money is the master of the humans relationships,
You´re not what you want be,
You are just the things you´ve got

You never can chose what you wanna be
They tell you based on the same old shit
Then once again we see the problems it creates
Winners and loosers are icons of our society

Money is the master of the humans relationships,
You´re not what you want be,
You are just the things you´ve got
You´ve got!

Always... putting you down!
Make... their way get easier
Tell... me now what´s right
I... refuse to accept... this shit!

Money is the master of the humans relationships,
You´re not what you want be,
You are just the things you´ve got
You´ve got!

Tell me now... what is right? or what is wrong?
Tell me now... who is the winner or the loser?
