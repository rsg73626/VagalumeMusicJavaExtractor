HOSTAGE

See a new dawning
And nothing has changed
The same old promises, get broken at last
Empty words just get me closer to the end!

You destroyed everything
That one day a man gave to you
That one day a man gave to you

All i wanted to say,
Everything i live,
It seems to be done, we can´t go back
I´m locked in a place where i don´t wanna stay
Where no one can hear me!

You destroyed everything
That one day a man gave to you
And no body can stop you

You destroyed everything
That one day a man gave to you
And no body can stop you

Let´s go!

We are under war looking for peace
Different movies with same endings
With starving eyes, people that only say amen
In this situation, we are just the hostages

Hostages!
