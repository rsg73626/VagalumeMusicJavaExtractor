BETRAYAL, FAKENESS, DESPERATION

Everyday i wake up early
Just to save my feed
They play tricks and mislied me
Always, always, always polite!

Behind the grin
They hide their ambition
Coz suit and tie mask you,
But it does not exempt the things you've got!

Betrayal, fakeness, desperation
Everyday is the same!
Betrayal, fakeness, desperation
Something will have to change...

It's could be anyone
But never could be you
Beacause of a nice position,
You threw your friends behind

And now you'll have to pay,
Ooah, you're gonna pay
Because suit and tie mask you
But it does not exempt the things you got!

Betrayal, fakeness, desperation
Everyday is the same!
Betrayal, fakeness, desperation
Something will have to change...

One day,
Every truth comes up and your mask comes down
One day,
Your time will gonna come,
With no predicted, date or place!
