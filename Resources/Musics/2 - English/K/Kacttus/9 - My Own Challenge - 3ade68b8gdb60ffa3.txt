MY OWN CHALLENGE

For thounsands times
we try to overcome all the rubs
I know there is a way...
A way not right to be follow

Realize... there´s another reason to believe!

And now once again...
I see myself into a doubt
The hardest way
That´s my challenge to face

We´ve gotta fight for what´s right,
We gotta do what is right!
We gotta do what is right!
We gotta always take control...

Don´t be affraid, keep always brave!
Problems we can face,
Problems we can face!
We gotta always take control

My own challenge was made to be faced!

That´s my own challenge...

The life will test,
Will test how much you resist
You must to be strong!
Hold on and do never give up...

Realize... there´s another reason to believe

Now
Face
Yourself

Don´t be affraid, keep always brave!

For long, long time I´ve been fighting
Against something I didn´t know
But now I know it´s against me
Fight against myself

Fight against myself...

That´s my own challenge!

We´ve gotta fight for what´s right,
That´s my own challenge... yeah yeah!
