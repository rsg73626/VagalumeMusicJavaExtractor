ONE STEP AT THE TIME

I just will look at you and smile
I'm standing in this crowded place
But all those people I cant see
It's us and nobody else

You want to be with me 
I see you inside out
It's in the way you look at me
Not hard to figure it out

Chorus:
I'm taking one step at the time
You what I want
One of a kind
I'm taking one step at the time
I'll make you mine

I'm taking one step at the time
I'm gonna wait

Won't cross the line
Just taking one step at the time 
To make you mine

one step at the time

If I decide I'll set my goal
I'd never quit, I can control
I see the way you look at me 
I know where you want to be 

I know I'm in your heart
Can't keep still on the ground
It's in the way you smile to me 
I could figure it out

I'm taking one step at the time
You what I want
One of a kind
I'm taking one step at the time

Repeat Chorus
