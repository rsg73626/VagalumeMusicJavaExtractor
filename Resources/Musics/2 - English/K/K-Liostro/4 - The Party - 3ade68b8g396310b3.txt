THE PARTY

In these times when there's nobody (nobody...)
And I realize, theorize that's not the way (not the way...)
Instead of feeling all alone that's not what to do
I need some fun that what I'm gonna do

Chorus:
Now I realize it's just a party
It's how I want to spend my life
(repeat)

It's a groove I feel in my body (in my body...)
I realize, theorize I found my cure (found my cure...)
I'm not feeling lonely and I don't feel blue
Cause I found the answer is to party with you

Chorus:
Now I realize it's just a party
It's how I want to spend my life
(repeat)
