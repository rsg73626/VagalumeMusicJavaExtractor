SUPER PROUD

In my life I have never met
Someone like you
It should be a dream
[People say there? s no way]
No chance to be
The woman you need
But I still dream

My sweet, sweet heart
I was not expecting you here in my life
But baby I want to open my heart
And if we go for a drink you' ll make me super proud

Sweet, sweet heart, I've never meet someone like [you]
Cause you know You make your dad super proud
You make your mom super proud
You make your friends super proud
Cause you're [so] sweet and [so] much more

Those times you won't forget
A woman like me
It's our dream
Send the rest away
It's my chance to be
All you need
It's still my dream
My sweet, sweet heart
I was not expecting you here in my life
But baby I want to open my heart
And if we go for a drink you' ll make me super proud

Sweet, sweet heart, I've never meet someone like [you]
Cause you know You make your dad super proud
You make your mom super proud
You make your friends super proud
Cause you're [so] sweet and [so] much more

In my life I have never met
Someone like you
It should be a dream
[People say there? s no way]
No chance to be
The woman you need
But I still dream

My sweet, sweet heart
I was not expecting you here in my life
But baby I want to open my heart
And if we go for a drink you' ll make me super proud

Sweet, sweet heart, I've never meet someone like [you]
Cause you know You make your dad super proud
You make your mom super proud
You make your friends super proud
Cause you're [so] sweet and [so] much more
