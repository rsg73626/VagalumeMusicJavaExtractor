MAN'S WORLD

I'll be the man you want
I'll change my whole life
If you  only give me this chance
I'll do only what you want me to do
I'll stay for every moment in time
And you will be mine

Chorus
And it's a man's world with man's laws baby
And it's a place where I can't live
With you here
And it's a man's world with man's laws baby
And it's a place where I can't live
Without you here
Without you here

I'll be the man you need
I'll change your life now
If you only let me into your heart
I'll do only what you want me to do
I'll stay for every moment in time
And you will be mine

Repeat Chorus

I would like to be your everything
To join our lives
To join our minds
So we can stay together all the time

I would like to be your everything
To join our lives
To join our minds
So we can stay together all the time

And 
I will be there
I will show you everyday
How much I care

You know what, you know why, you know who I am
I can't lie, I can't leave, I can't disappear cause you know
You know I will always love you 

Repeat Chorus
