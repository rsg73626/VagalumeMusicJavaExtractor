DREAM ON A STAR

Hush now, don't speak
This is just the start
Words can't save us
Spinning in my heart

Little things that bind
Stronger than you know
Gentle smiling heart
Will always be at home
Dream on a star
We're more than we are

Heaven's here tonight
Magic burning bright
An angel full of life
You're never alone
Dream on a star
We're more than we are

Heaven's here tonight
Magic burning bright
An angel full of life
You're never alone

Dream on a star
Dream on a star
Dream dream dream
Dream dream
