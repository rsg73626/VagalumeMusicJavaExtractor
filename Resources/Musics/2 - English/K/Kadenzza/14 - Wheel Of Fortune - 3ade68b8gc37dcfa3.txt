WHEEL OF FORTUNE

Ride on, wheel of fortune turning round
Never returns from the past

Move on, a myriad of times passing by
Only time will be telling truth, go on

Disguising sorrow
Face up to face
I'm waiting for you to shine
Chasing the shadow
Fight with yourself
Till sunrise comes again

Never surrender, you know doing to be
You never lose, you can dice with death

Cry out, lots of tears falling down
Only solitude left you blind

Get out, the light is clear to leave your dark
Behind memories of grief, no more

Never surrender, you know doing to be
You never lose, you can dice with death
Forevermore, as a river flows to the sea
Your wish comes true at the end of time
