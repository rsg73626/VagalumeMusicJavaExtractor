THE WOLFOID

Red eyes searching for your flesh and blood
iron claws for tearing up white skin
bloody fangs are ready for your first taste
I'm the wolf incarnated as man. 

Dead or alive?
You can't choose anything.
Anguish and fear
waiting for you're coming in hell. 

The sinful nectar dripping from your nasty lips
aroused my hidden nature in the beast as man
with screaming in the pleasure of sweet pain
you're fated to conceive my child, you bitch! 

Dead or alive?
You can't choose anything.
The way to survive
you must inherit my fate. 

I'm not man disguised as dog...
I'm wolf disguised as man...
society created me
and finally denied the existence.
But remember, the hunter only kills the wolf...
it's in the fairy-tale world... 

Dead or alive?
You can't choose anything.
I dare to die
to survive in the legend of terror.
