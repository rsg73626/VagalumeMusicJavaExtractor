KAMIKAZE BLOWS

Ephemeral life is going on
Only memories lying behind
The way I have to go
To change it before

Watch it, exploited by the material world
Enslaved to fame and fortune
Money begets much money
Plague in economy
For freedom, deceived in fighting with your foe
Despite you're a true enemy
Wasted my blood for your honor
Now, back from hell

Reborn to be a rebellion
Burning inside the evil will
Betokened raising hell
Covering the earth

White, imperial patriots
Follow the sign of my god
Devote your blood for my flesh
You hear the oppressed cry out

Be brave, I'll give you the eternal wings
To fly higher over the sea
One way fuel to target
Vengeance on attack

You ride on the iron wings
To be a blast of wind
Go ahead without fear
No pain, no need to feel

Obey, the holy war has just begun
You're nothing but a machine
Yes, the machine at the controls
No personality, no feelings and no sense
Just cling to an enemy's carrier
