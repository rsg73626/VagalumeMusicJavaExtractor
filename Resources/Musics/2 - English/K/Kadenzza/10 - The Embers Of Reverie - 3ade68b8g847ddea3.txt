THE EMBERS OF REVERIE

Every moment I feel your love 
you ought to know... 
every night you whisper in dream 
but you left me alone 
except my memories 
as the empty room is scented with you. 

I would believe in you 
it must not be a dream 
still wrecked mind 
everything reminds me of you. 

Even if you should be fake 
what would it matter for me? 
Waiting for you turn me on 
burning the embers of reverie of you. 

Have I been hacked my ghost? 
Was that the simulated past? 
Even so you're the one 
I can feel the embers of reverie 
I can see... 
I can hear... 
I can touch... 
I can't stand anymore...
