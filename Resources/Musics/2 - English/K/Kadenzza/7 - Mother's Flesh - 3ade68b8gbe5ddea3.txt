MOTHER'S FLESH

Relieve your thirst 
stave off your hunger 
what satisfy your desire is the very thing 
yes, it's mother's flesh and blood. 

My sword licks its lips up your body 
you will taste of my sword of lusts 
ready to do it 
no time to pray 
no way to escape 
no one to help you... 

Any happy childhood memories 
any touch of soft and warm mother's hands 
you have these memories no longer 
she is gonna be your flesh and blood. 

"Mother' I'm thirsty" 
"Drink some wine from the jar" 
"That's your mother's blood you're drinking" 
"Mother, a little bird in the chimney says I'm drinking your blood" 
"Throw your cloak at it" 
Having eaten the meat and drunk the blood, 
the little girl turned to her mother and said 
"I don't know why, but I'm very sleepy..." 

"Come over here and rest" 
The girl undressed and approached the bed... 
where her mother lay in a strange position... 
with a hood pulled over her face. 
"Mother, what big ears you have" 
"Mother, what big eyes you have" 
"Mother, what big claws you have" 
"Mother, what big teeth you have" 

Spouting warm blood I've been looking for 
your fresh heart still beating in my hand 
I suck your juicy brain from the skull 
your eyeballs stare into space at nothing. 

Ready for death 
no time to pray 
no way to escape 
no one to help you... 

Heaven loves hell 
hell needs heaven 
a fallen angel once has borne wolf a son 
that is me, a child of mixed blood. 

You only curse my fate, innate evil 
defile your purity with my original sin. 

I can suck the cock of your god 
I can fuck your sacred god... 

And then the wolf 
ate up little red riding hood...
