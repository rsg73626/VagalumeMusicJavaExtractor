GHOST IN THE SHELL

Can you see your own face?
Yes, real, true yourself in the mirror is just false
Bilateral symmetry could be made in your memory
The existing reality is no more than fantasy.

Don't you even know who you are?
Don't you even know where you're from?

Can't you hear you calling yourself
From the shell of lead-gray
The voice you've never heard, however it's just you.

Don't you even know what's your name?
Don't you even know why you live?

Ghost in the shell, lost in hell
To take your soul back beyond the deleted past
Ghost in the shell, lost in hell
We live as human, yes, warm blood we can feel.

This world is like a masquerade
Crazy dancing in slow death
Rape your minds of innocence
All of bodies are artificial,
All of souls are over-written
Ghost-hacked humans, you...
What are you longing for?
