THE ABYSS STARES AT YOU

When you look into the abyss 
the abyss looks back into your soul 
every fear hides truth 
until the rest of life turns to dust. 

I'm the abyss... 
I'm all that remains breathing out slow death 
I'm always looking at you from a crack of the matrix. 

Dance in the source 
just like a puppet show 
descending your body shell 
into a light in black 
enter my dreamland... 

Welcome to this decadent world 
waste your life, live a lie 
intercourse, copulate with, 
breed like rats, eat yourself... 
I'm the architect of this world.
