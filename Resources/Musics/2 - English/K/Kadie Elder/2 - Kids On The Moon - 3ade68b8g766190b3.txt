KIDS ON THE MOON

No you never do complain
About the man I am
I never get restrained
In a crazy plan

And I know my head is turned
In a different way
And I need that jerk
Never play it safe

Hoping with a lot of show
You accomodate
I never keep it low
Like they always say

We're the kids on the moon
Driving up slow
Going to the right planet

It's the way you hold my hand
So I can put my feet
Like a wellknown land
Living on in me

Knowing that we come back down
From another trip
Not a single frown
Just kiss my lips

You will be the only
You will be the only
Thing I love

We're the kids on the moon
Driving up slow
Going to the right planet

You can make me stay under your flag
Headed for the moon and going back

We're the kids on the moon
Driving up slow
Going to the right planet
