FIRST TIME HE KISSED A BOY

Troubled face
Headphones on
Forgetting time and place
All he wanted

Feeling stuck
Set him free
Running out of luck
On his knees

First time he kissed a boy
He had never never known
Cover up is what they told
Feel so cold

First time he kissed a boy
He had never never loved
Walks on a curvy road
Feel so cold

Keeping back
The ghost inside
Locked him in a pack
All his life
All his life

First time he kissed a boy
He had never never known
Cover up is what they told
Feel so cold

First time he kissed a boy
He had never never loved
Walks on a curvy road
Feel so cold

Get lost, get lost, get lost
Get lost get lost, get lost
