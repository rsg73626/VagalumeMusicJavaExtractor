WORK

These niggas speak on their word
Me, I just speak on the time
Time and the effort that I have invested
Inside of myself, I am losing my mind
I want it all, I said I'm mentally tough
Oh, what you thought I would quit?
Even in days when I feel at my worst
I will get up my ass
And then get back to work
Oh, lawd

Ain't nobody gonna get it for you
Better go ahead
And get it by your motherfucking self
By yourself, nigga

Ain't no lame excuses
All of those are useless
I don't ever use it
Don't ever confuse it
Lawd! what's the point of complain'
I said it
I'd never do it
I'm working in isolation
Silently I've been approvin'
Moving like I'm really focused
Fortified and then devoted
Sacrificing for a dream
I see myself inside a favored place
I can't escape
I'm panicking, I'm pissing in a corner
Cop a coroner then come and get me
I'm missing my sanity
I'm salivating over beats
I'm motivated by the pay
And now I spend the situation
I wanted them to connect
I resurrect the second
Descendant from any syllable
The sympathetic simile and apathetic energy
My appetite is actually enormous
I'm repetition
I practice, I promise that I'm so
Passing, I promise you, an independent
I been using irented to cause the picture
Personally I'mma that I made it to 24
As I forced the feeling to source
I'm definitely the voice
For anyone that isn't all
I can't atone
I tried this scheme
But god escaped my heart
From my happiness, I want another pill
I said I'll force a better one
I started with loosing
It with another prescription
I'm like a different person
I know my mother disappointed
From decisions I'm making
I probly should have stayed in college
She said I want to procrastinate
That was a couple years ago
So I was on a mission to make up
For all the time
I never let her down
I'm workin' to get it out, goddamn!

Ain't no lame excuses
All of those are useless
I don't ever use it
Don't ever confuse it
Lawd!

Yaah! nawledge!
Nigga! 's higher than a muthafucka
Cause niggas, niggas really work
Me n' my nigga jason we about to
We about to start
A real motherfucking project
And this is gonna be dope as shit

But this here just sum' quick, mane
Just sum' real fucking quick
Shout out to cliff for the beat
