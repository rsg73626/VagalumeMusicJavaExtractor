L.O.V.E (LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN)

"(L.O.V.E, L.O.V.E, L.O.V.E, L.O.V.E) 

There is one thing that's always on my mind 
shining so brightly in the velvet sky 
It's the way that I hope it could always be, 
you're my little piece of heaven 
You're the only one who has got this far, 
You're my shining star and it's really bizarre 
It's the way that I hope it could always be 
You're my little piece of heaven 

It's a little piece of heaven 
It's a little piece of heaven 
You're my little piece of heaven 
It's a little piece of heaven 

It's a little piece of heaven 
It's a little piece of heaven 
You're my little piece of heaven 
It's a little piece of heaven 
Shine on me 

It's a little piece of heaven

It's a little piece of heaven 
It's a little piece of heaven 
You're my little piece of heaven 
It's a little piece of heaven 
Shine on me 

It's a little piece of heaven 
There's no gravity tonight 
There's just this racing sunlight 
You're my little piece of heaven 
It's the only way I want it to be 
Shine on me 
It's a little piece of heaven 
There's no gravity tonight (It's a little piece of heaven) 
There's just this racing sunlight (You're my little piece of heaven) 
You're my little piece of heaven 
It's the only way I want it to be (Little piece of heaven) 
Shine on 
Shine on me"
