NEVER BE THE SAME

You’ll never take me alive
I’ll never surrender
No, I will stand my ground, stand my ground forever

I’ll never break the line it’s now or never
This time it’s do or die
We will always remember

And here we are eyes open wide
Fighting for

Change me from who I was and will be
I’ll never be the same
This time I’ll take my chances
And fan these sparks to flames
Break free from these chains
That hold me nothing can control
My skin and bones may fail me
But you cannot contain what I have gained

I hear a distant fire the sound makes me tremble
I know I’ll do or die to make this world remember

We’re never gonna stop now
We’re never gonna back down
It’s only coming straight from the heart
