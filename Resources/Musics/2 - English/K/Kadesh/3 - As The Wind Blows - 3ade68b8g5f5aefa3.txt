AS THE WIND BLOWS

I’ve been stuck inside this rut for months
Just wondering where I should go
And this feeling that’s inside of me
Hurts so much but I’m just pressing onwards

You and me are one and now I see
This feeling that I feel feels real
And I feel

Swiftly as the wind blows now, oh I feel you

Is it love after love, the only love I really need is your love
Cause everything I try to do, I do it for me and all I get is failures
