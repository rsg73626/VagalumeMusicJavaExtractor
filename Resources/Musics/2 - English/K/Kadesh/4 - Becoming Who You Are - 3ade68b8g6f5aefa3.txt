BECOMING WHO YOU ARE

I’ll tell you what I hear
In spite of what they say
The answer’s loud and clear
You don’t have to fear the day

You know there’s something more than what you’re seeing
You know there’s something more worth believing
There’s gotta be something more and you can feel it

You know the way you feel broken
You know this pain is real but you’re hoping
That someone understands where you are
You can’t do this alone

Wait for a sign becoming who you
Wait for a sign from far beyond the stars
From deep inside your heart
Becoming who you are

No matter where you’ve been no matter where you’ve gone
You’ll never be too far from the father’s loving arms

You know there’s something more than what you’re seeing
He’ll give you life and love if you’ll receive it
There’s gotta be something more and you can feel it
