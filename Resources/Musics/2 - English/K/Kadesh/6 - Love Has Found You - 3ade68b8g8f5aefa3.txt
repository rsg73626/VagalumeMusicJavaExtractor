LOVE HAS FOUND YOU

You thought that your fears had turned to failures
You gave up on the hope of something new
So just lift your head now and see
There’s more that you could be
Love has found you

There are hopeful skies if you’d open up your eyes
There is more to life if you look you just might find
Love has found you

You thought that you’d never change the moment
You broke down and finally dreamt of something real
So just lift your head now and see
There’s more that you could be
Love has found you

You can’t keep running away forever
You know your time has come
You can’t keep running away forever
There’s no escape from love
Love has found you
