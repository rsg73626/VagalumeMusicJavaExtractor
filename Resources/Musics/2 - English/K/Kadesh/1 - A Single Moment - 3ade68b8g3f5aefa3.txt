A SINGLE MOMENT

I breathe but the moment still feels wasted
Can it be that there’s nothing more than this
Tell me I’m dreaming
I feel like we’ve been asleep for years

Just as the sun awakes so I can see the morning
I feel it in my bones and now its got me shaking
We can change the world in just a single moment
Just look into your heart and keep the door wide open
Cause love’s the only fight that we should not abandon
We can change the world with just a single moment

Love even if you feel like running
And you can change the darkness of a day
All those around you they keep dreaming
Will they know what’s real
