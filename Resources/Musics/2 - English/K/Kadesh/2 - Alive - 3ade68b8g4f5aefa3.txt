ALIVE

I want to know the depths
And I want to climb the heights
I want to know a love
That makes me feel alive

And though I don’t see it now
Someday I’ll say
I’m alive with you now

I don’t wanna be afraid of love
Or find out it may never come
I don’t wanna feel safe somehow
And give up on broken vows
