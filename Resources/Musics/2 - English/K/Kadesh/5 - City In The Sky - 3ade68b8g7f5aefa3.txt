CITY IN THE SKY

Beyond the deep blue ocean
Beyond this cloudy sky
Before the wars fought by our father’s
And after the end of time
I hear a song repeating

One day we will fly
To the city in the sky

Tell your brothers and your sisters
There’s hope for the fallen here
There’s a cure for the pain filled faces
A place with no more fear
I hear a song repeating

One day we will fly
To the city in the sky

So lay down your burdens now
So lay down your weary heart and fly
