BODY SHOTS (FEAT. LUDACRIS)

(At the bar, at the bar, at the bar, at the bar)

Fresh 21, walk up to the club 
Got my girls, cut in line 'cause we're a step above 

Walk up to the bar, buying drinks like a star 
My girls they wanna try it, so we had to buy it 

Un huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down 
Uh huh, drink it up (uuuh I think she likes that) 

Un huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down 
Uh huh, drink it up (uuuh I think she likes that) 

Doing shots, at the bar 
Body shots, at the bar 
My girls they wanna try it, so we had to buy it 
At the what? At the bar 
At the what? At the bar
My girls they wanna try it so we're drinking like we're rock stars

Top alcohol (mix it up, mix it up) 
Got me laying down and I pull my shirt up 
Baby get the whip cream, feeling like a wet dream 
Got me at the bar, doing body shots now

Un huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down 
Uh huh, drink it up (uuuh I think she likes that) 

Un huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down 
Uh huh, drink it up (uuuh I think she likes that) 

Doing shots, at the bar 
Body shots, at the bar 
My girls they wanna try it, so we had to buy it 
At the what? At the bar
At the what? At the bar
My girls they wanna try it so we're drinking like we're rock stars

Un huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down 
Uh huh, drink it up (uuuh I think she likes that) 

Un huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down 
Uh huh, drink it up (uuuh I think she likes that) 

Doing shots, at the bar 
Body shots, at the bar 
My girls they wanna try it, so we had to buy it
At the what? At the bar
At the what? At the bar
My girls they wanna try it so we're drinking like we're rock stars
