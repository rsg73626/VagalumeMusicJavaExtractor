CAN'T HELP MYSELF

I can't help myself
I gotta get out
I can't help myself) 4X

Push and pull me
'round and round
We go until we're
broke and lonely
Talk it out
Strip it down
To make it honesty you bring me
Back to where we're
meant to be
Sparks ignite the flames inside me
Burn until fire feels
much bigger than the world around me

CHORUS:
Your love is like,
it's like a spell
and I just can not help myself
I'm hypnotized
because it's right
I love the way you make me high
You mess me up
You make me cry
And the I stay and I wonder why?
I want to love somebody else
but I just can not help myself

(I can't help myself.
I gotta get out.
I can't help myself) 2X

You gave me love I never knew I
needed til it was depleted.
'Cause it's real
It's worth the fight
So hold on through
this rocky ride

CHORUS

(I can't help myself.
I gotta get out.
I can't help myself.) 4X

CHORUS: 3X

(I can't help myself.
I gotta get out.
I can't help myself.) 4X
