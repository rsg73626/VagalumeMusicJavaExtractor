I WILL LEARN TO LOVE AGAIN

To love again
To love again
To love again
To love again
To love again

Driving in tears like on be me
I will soon be
Free from to change vow this pain inside
And the why cried
I won't be long
'Til I begin the strenght to know, I can go on
I will find my way
Through the heartbreak
I will not give up for love, I believe

Chorus:
I will learn to love again
I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mean
I will learn to, learn to love again

All of these tears
Time will drive in
I will survive in
And make it through into another day
All of this pain
Time will heal it
There'll be a time, sometime I know, I won't feel it
How live through
Like without you
After the hurting is gone
I believe

Chorus:
I will learn to love again
I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mean
I will learn to, learn to love again

And I'll find someone
Who deserves my touch
After all the hurt is through
I will be so over you
I will not give up for love, I believe
Yeahhh

I will learn to love again..
I will learn to trust...
Once this heart can start to mean
I will learn...to love again

To love again (repete at√© sumir)
