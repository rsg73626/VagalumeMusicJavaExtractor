CRAZY POSSESSIVE

Ohhh I got your crazy
I'm going out of my mind

I think I'm crazy
I think I'm going out of my mind
You call me crazy
I thought I saw you touching my guy
Are you crazy?
Maybe I should take you outside
And show you crazy
Ohhh I got your crazy

A little hazy
Maybe I'm just losing my mind
I think your shady
I know that you've been calling my guy
Are you crazy?
Now I'm gonna take you outside
And show you crazy
Ohhh I got your crazy

Call my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
Touch my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
And then you call me your best friend, and then you call me your best friend

Call me crazy
Everytime that I turn around
You want my baby
Ohhh but I'm his lady
Am I possessive?
Just because I'm claiming what's mine
Your crossing the line

Why are you constantly calling him up
To pick you up
Let me know now
How can you call me your best friend
Then turn around and secretly text him
You call me crazy
Ohhh I got your crazy

Call my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
Touch my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up

Call my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
Touch my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
And then you call me your best friend, and then you call me your best friend

They calling me crazy
They say I'm crazy
They call me crazy
They think I'm crazy
Ohhh I got your crazy

Call my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
Touch my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up

Touch my man again and imma **** you up, and imma **** you up
