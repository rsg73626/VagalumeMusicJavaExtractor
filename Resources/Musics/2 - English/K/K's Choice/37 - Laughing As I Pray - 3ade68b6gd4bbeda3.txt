LAUGHING AS I PRAY

As I'm walking through these streets again,
I'm crawling.
And as I try to live my life again,
I'm falling down.

Can you pick me up,
can you let it stop
can you make it go away.

won't somebody help me, is it hard
to let me find my way.
won't somebody love me, for a start,
i'm laughing as I pray.

Where is the road.
I must look at the road;
I must pray a little longer,
or laugh a little more.
