ME HAPPY

That's a stupid hat you're wearing,
it doesn't really match your hair.
Did I ever tell you that your breath is worse
than what you wear.

That's exactly what she told him,
at least that's what he told me.
So I guess we could conclude
they're not a happy family.

Love's not what you see
between the legs of the majority.

That's a lovely dress you're wearing,
too bad your figure can't make it work.
When I hear the things you say,
I wonder if your brain can work.

That's exactly what he told het,
at least that's what she told me.
I scream my calls, I lock my doors,
I'm suddenly filled with apathy.

Love's not what you see
between the legs of the majority.

Although I'd like to add
the game in bed is a necessity
to make me happy.

Love's not what you see
between the legs of the majority.

Although I'd like to add
the game in bed is a necessity.
