WE'RE ALREADY THERE

Go on my love
I know you will show
But if there was a way
I would keep you home
You fight for the tears
In the eyes of our child
As she stares at the head
Of her brother who died
For our future, our land
For the freedom to dance
Wherever the music might lead us my friends

You died all alone
And I no longer pray
Because if there was a God
He'd let you stay
So tomorrow I'll burn
Our house to the ground
And we'll join you up there
We no longer care
'bout the future, our land
Or the freedom to dance
