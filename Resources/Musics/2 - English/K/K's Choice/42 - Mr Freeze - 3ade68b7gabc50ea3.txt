MR FREEZE

I'm about to tell you about a man I've known
since I've been able to open up a refrigerator

I am wondering today in the sun on a boat to Dover
could you freeze me in and defrost me when it's over

Mr. Freeze, I feel your chill
as I inhale the urge to kill all my emotions
I ask you please, but all you do is make me sneeze
Mr. Freeze

I am wondering today in the sun on a boat to Dover
whose shadow it is that appears as I bend over

It's Mr. Freeze, I hear no sound
as I focus on the amount of my emotions
I ask you please, take the lead or let me bleed
Mr. freeze

my temperature is really low now; you're here
but you're not welcome any longer
I will release Mr. Freeze

no bangs,no yells, merely the sea
is Mr. Freeze inside of me...

I am wondering today in the sun on a boat to Dover
