ALL

Is there anything you want from me
My arms, my life, my energy
I don't know how far I can go
Everything says no
But you know how it goes when
Youâ€™re used to your side of the bed

I know you don't belong in this room
But you're here now
So what can I do

All that I am is
All I was taught to be
All that you are is
A wall between myself and me

Have you ever really looked at me
Or thought about me secretly
Do I make you wonder at all
About the speed of light
Outside our little world we might not
Feel so alone and

I know you don't belong in this room
But you're here now
So what can I do

All that I am is
All I was taught to be
All that you are is
A wall between myself and me

All that I am is
All I was taught to be
All that you are is
A wall between myself and me
