LOSING YOU

Welcome the rainbow, fading to gray
Spinning around us, making (me say) mistakes
I'm looking for something like most of us do
I'm looking at god but he's looking at you
He looks for a driver to take him back home
To get it together by being alone
I'm sure he's a writer, he wrote me just now
The letter is empty like I'm living now


But that feels good to do
Compared to losing you


Do I need a baby to smother the pain
To stop all (I) live through from being in vain
Vanity fills me, vanity's nice
But somehow it kills you by hitting you twice
So take it all brother, take it from me
All but my lover 'cause she is in me
So many lovers don't look but they find
We're lovers too but I'm losing my mind


Can I be a memory
Can I be a part of your ways
Can I be the moonlight
That shines on your beautiful face
You can make me glow
I don't think you know...

(SOLO)


| I keep on singing a song is a dove
| It lives in a desert to celebrate love

May be tomorrow, may be tonight
You will look up and you'll know I'm all right
But me I'll be searching
Looking for truth
Finding a gimpse in a picture of you
I will be ready, ready to ride
Ready to roam as I'm burning inside
But that....
