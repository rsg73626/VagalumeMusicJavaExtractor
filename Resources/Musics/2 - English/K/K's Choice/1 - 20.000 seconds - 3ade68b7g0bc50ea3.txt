20.000 SECONDS

20,000 seconds since you left and I'm still counting

And 20,000 reasons to get up, get some thing done

But I'm still waiting

 

Is someone kind enough to 

Pick me up and give me food, assure me that the world is good

But you should be here, you should be here

 

How colors can change and even the texture of the rain 

And what's that ugly little stain on the bathroom floor

 

I'd rather not deal with that right now

I'd rather be floating in space somewhere or

Worry about the Ozone layer

 

And it's almost like a corny movie scene

But I'm out of frame and the lighting's bad

And the music has no theme

And were all so strong when nothing's wrong

And the world is at our feet

But how small we are when our love is far away

 

And all you need is you
