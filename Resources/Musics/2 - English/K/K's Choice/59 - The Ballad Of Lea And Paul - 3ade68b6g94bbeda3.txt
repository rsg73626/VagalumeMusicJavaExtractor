THE BALLAD OF LEA AND PAUL

Paul studied a lot
at least he pretended to.
He had too much on his mind.
It was too small,
to see the beauty of it all.

Lea loved him a lot,
at least she pretended to.
He was always on her mind.
She said, Paul,
there's a fire in the hall.

And when it finally burned the questions
for the answers he had found,
he realised it ought to be the other way around.

There's a fire burning in the hall.
It looks great, I don't care, let it burn,
I don't care, I don't care,
I don't care at all.

They got married right on the spot,
at least I presumed they did.
i have too much on my mind
to tell you the fall
of Lea and Paul,
out in the hall.

For the moment that this song has stopped
they'll probably be dead.
So it's better, maybe wiser,
to leave the rest unsaid.
