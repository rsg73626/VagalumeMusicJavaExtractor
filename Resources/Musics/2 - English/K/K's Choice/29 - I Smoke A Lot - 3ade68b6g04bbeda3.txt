I SMOKE A LOT

I smoke a lot.
I'm not talking weed or pot,
I smoke the regular stuff.
I smoke a lot.

And if you're a smoker too,
you've got to know sometimes it's tough
to be in healthy company.
People who always say:
'You smoke a lot,

Imagine the amount of money
you could save if you'd quit.
You smoke a lot,
by now you'd have a bike,
aren't you concerned about the kids?'

Well, of course, sure I am,
concerned a bit.
But about that bike,
i could get killed on it.
And is that what you really want,
it's not.

So I smoke a lot,
I smoke a lot.
My god I smoke a lot, and I feel fine,
I smoke a lot.

I smoke a lot,
sometimes it's great,
sometimens it's not,
but I smoke a lot.
