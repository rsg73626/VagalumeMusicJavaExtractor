ALL RIGTH

I lock the door and lock my head
And dream of butterflies instead
The beauty of their coloured wings
The trees, the grass, and pretty things
Imagination fills the void of my existence

Daddy says: "I love you girl, it's not your fault
Your mum and me don't get along"
I know he's lying, I know there is no such thing as inexplicable
I hear and forget this world in bed and suddenly the sun comes up
That's when my pets all come alive
They cheer me up and tell me:
"Everything's all right, stuffed animals are always right"

My favourite song, my favourite show
I wonder if they even know or if they care
Or if they even notice I am standing there
I want my pets to come alive and cheer me up and tell me:
"Everything's all right, stuffed animals are allways right"
"Everything's all right, stuffed animals are allways right"

My eyes all red, the baby's wet
Someone has to get that phone
I want my pets to come alive and cheer me up and tell me

Alright

I lock the door and lock my head
And dream of butterflies instead
