I NEED A LOVER

I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
Some guy to thrill me and then go away
I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
Some girl who knows the meaning of
'Hey hit the highway'

Well I've been walking the streets up and down
Racing through the human jungle at night
I'm so confused, my mind is indifferent
Hey I'm so weak won't somebody shut off the light

Electricity runs through the video
As I watch from this hole I call home
All the stony's are dancing to the radio
And I got the world calling me up here
Tonight on the phone

I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
I need a lover who won't drive me mad
I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
Some guy who knows the meaning of
'Hey hit the highway'

Well I'm not wiped out by this poolroom life I'm living
Gonna quit this job, go to school or head back home
Well I'm not asking to be loved or be forgiven
Hey I just can't shaken in this bedroom
One more night alone

I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
I need a lover who won't drive me mad
I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
Some girl who knows the meaning of
'Hey hit the highway'

I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
I need a lover who won't drive me mad
I need a lover who won't drive me crazy
