ANOTHER YEAR

I wish you could adore
The way you did before
Now you're living through another year
Oh, the light you were
Will soon become a blur
As you're living through another year

Oh, what a waste of time it is
To indulge inside of bliss
Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

You're not sick, so you can’t heal
But I wonder do you feel
The need to cry: 'I'm out of here'
Oh, your goal is safe
But is it all you crave
As you're living through another year

Oh, what a waste of time it is
To indulge inside of bliss
Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

Is it me on how I see
The face of mediocrity
I try to smile you see
Your lightness darkens me
Filter all of your emotions
Fake you’re never low
Or face the one you fear
You’re living through another year

Another year to lie
Another year goes by
Another year to lie
Another year goes by
