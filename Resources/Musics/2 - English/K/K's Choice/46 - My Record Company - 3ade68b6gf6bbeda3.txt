MY RECORD COMPANY

Beware, beware
they're on their way
They're getting closer every day
but I'm prepared
I'm sure some common sense will 
blow them all away

They like your band
they shake your hand
they smell like food that has gone bad
Today it's you
today will pass
I'm so sick of all this trash...

(Don't take it personally, oh, no...)

And sometimes in the middle of
the roaches' nest
you find a little soul
that understands the content of a song, so...

(Don't take it personally, oh, no...)
