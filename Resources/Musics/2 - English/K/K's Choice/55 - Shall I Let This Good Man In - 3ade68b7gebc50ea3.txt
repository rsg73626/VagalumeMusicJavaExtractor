SHALL I LET THIS GOOD MAN IN

Hey, Stranger
Would you come in through my door
If not now I'll leave it ajar
And then maybe you could come back
I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be hoping here for you
I'll be praying here that you'll believe it's true
That in all these lonely years
I would have loved your company
But I never could give in
To this fragile side of me
You see I've always been a man of great ambition
But success just turned his back & never came
And now I find I became a man
Of even greater solitude
And I wish I'd spend more time making friends
With guys like you
Oh, Stranger
How can I make you stay?
For a little while
Oh, Stranger
Please, don't go away

I'm living on
I'm singing on
Just let me sing one song for you

Hey, Stranger
This is my song
It is old & it is wrinkle
I tried it for too long
I tried it time after time
To forget about myself
And to hide in it a while
But a while's been goin' on
Since I can't remember when
And got catched up by the life
Of a lost & lonely man
I think I'm-a sung away a little faster
Then I planned

Hey, Stranger
This is my life
I can't use it anymore
For I share it with no one but myself
I can't fool you anymore
Let me hide with you a while
Let me try a little while
And then maybe
You'll believe it's true
That in all the years I spent
With the glory of a fool
Making diamonds outta tears
On the highest bid to go
I've been searching for a friend
To tell my troubles to
But I could never understand
How to get out of that cell
