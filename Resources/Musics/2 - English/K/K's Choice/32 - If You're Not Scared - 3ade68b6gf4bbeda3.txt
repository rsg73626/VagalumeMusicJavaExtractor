IF YOU'RE NOT SCARED

Outside it's raining, still you shine
How I've missed your trembling hands inside of mine
I've been away for ages, still you care
Do you count the Sundays when I'm there

Teach me how to watch this game
The way you see it through your magical frame
Time is ticking, try to see
That I am you and you are me

Don't deny that you're afraid to go
Don't deny that you want to cry
Look around and watch your children grow
I feel love in every sigh
If you're not scared, then why am I

Tell me stories, tell me more
Make me feel guilty for being bored
Tell me how to pick up things I've dropped
Please keep talking, never stop

Don't deny that you're afraid to go
Don't deny that you want to cry
Look around and watch your children grow
I feel love in every sigh
Pray for eternity to fly
Don't understand but how I try
If you're not scared, then why am I
I feel love in every sigh
Pray for eternity to fly
Don't understand but how I try
If you're not scared, then why am I

If you're not scared, then why am I
If you're not scared, then why am I
