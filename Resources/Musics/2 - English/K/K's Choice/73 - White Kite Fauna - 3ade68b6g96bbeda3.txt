WHITE KITE FAUNA

in a dark well
late at night
children crying, they've lost their Kite
they're left with nothing but

giant lizards
eating deer
growing appetite as they notice that
their prey's still breathing

lizards' eyes reflection
shows a glimpse of imperfection
through the spastic sighs of Innocence
of deer's blood and its cruel attraction

white kite fauna, do you feel
white kite fauna, is it real...

in a dark well
I found a kite
bloodstained, so beautiful
recognizable

I close mmy eyes and
I perceive
marble Emptiness
looking for my soul to bless

lizards' eyes..
white kite fauna, do you feel
white kite fauna, is it real
white kite fauna, do you feel
white kite fauna, will it heal

in a dark well
late at night 
I am crying
I've lost my Kite
left with nothing
