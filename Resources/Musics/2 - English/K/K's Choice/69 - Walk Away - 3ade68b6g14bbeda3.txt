WALK AWAY

I will walk away from you,
don't stop me,
I will walk away from you,
don't blame me.

I have felt the ugly midget knocking on my knee.
I have seen the ugly midget walking over me.

I will tell you what I've learned.
Were through as far as I'm concerned.
Break up and just before we do,
I will walk away from you.

I will walk away from you,
stop me.
I will walk away from you,
blame me.

I have had enough of you,
tell me you hate me too.
Or embrace me and forget
what I have said to you.

I will tell you what I've learned.
We're one as far as I'm concerned.
Make up and just before we do,
I will be walking back to you.

Walking back to you.
