I WILL RETURN TO YOU

Today there's nothing more to say,
but someday I'll return to you.
Today things didn't go our way,
maybe tomorrow I will return to you.

Today I'd like to slip away from all this pain.
Someday I will return to you.
Today I'd like to be a cell inside your vein.
Maybe tomorrow I will return to you.

Once more I'd like to put a spider in your bed,
for that, I will return to you.
I want you to hear the things I never said,
for that, I will return to you.

Dry the rain inside my head,
to hear the things I never said,
I will return to you.

To be a light beam through a cloud,
to laugh at things I'm singing now,
I will, I will return to you.
I will return to you, to you.
Someday, I'll return to you.
