WAIT

I hold it
I fold it
I throw it on the floor
I rolled it Maybe I'm afraid the you'll be bored
It's very real and true and sad and hopeful just like me
It's one of tose things I'll never tell
I'll carve it in a tree
I follow you.  I watch you
I thank god you're in my class
I picture us in the school bus and we're holding each others hands

I need a plan for you to fall in love with me and then
I'll make you marry me
I'll Wait
Wait wait wait
wait

I never wear my glasses when I know that you can see me
You act as if I'm not around but deep down you must need me
I draw you every single feature in my head
I try to do my homework but I dream of you instead

I need a plan for you to fall in love with me and then
I'll make you marry me
I'll Wait
Wait wait  wait
wait

I'll make you marry me
I'll make you marry me
I'll make you marry marry me

I'll wait
(I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait)
