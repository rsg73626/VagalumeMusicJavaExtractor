HIDE

Watch me, I'm coming closer
I am the mood you're in tonight
Pretty poser, perfect armageddon bride
I am a circle, it feels right
I am the one who swallows light
Multiplying parasite
Perfect features, perfect sight

You who thought you had it all
Lost your leaves before the fall
You should have killed me
You should have tried
Armageddon bride, hide, hide

Watch me, bright but blurry
Yet you knew I've always been
In a hurry to contaminate what's clean

Drawing whiskers in the sky for fun, to cover up the sun
As you sting me with your laughter

Hide, hide, armageddon bride, hide, hide
You who thought you had it all
Lost your leaves before the fall
You should have killed me
You should have tried
You better hide
Armageddon

You who thought you had it all
Lost your leaves before the fall
Hide, hide, hide
