ALREADY THERE

Go on my love
I know you must go
But if there were a way
I would keep you home

You'll fight for the tears
In the eyes of our child
As she stares at the hands
Of her brother who died

For our future, our land
Or the freedom to dance
Wherever the music
Might lead us my friends

You died all alone
And I no longer pray
Cause if there were a God
He'd have let you stay

So tomorrow I'll burn
Our house to the ground
And we'll join you up there
We no longer care

About the future, our land
Or the freedom to dance
Wherever you are
