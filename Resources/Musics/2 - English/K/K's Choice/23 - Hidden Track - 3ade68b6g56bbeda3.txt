HIDDEN TRACK

go on my love
I know you must go
but if there were a way
I would keep you home
you fight for the tears
in the eyes of our child
as she stares at the hands
of her brother who died
for our future our land
for the freedom to dance
wherever the music might lead us my friend.
you died all alone
and I no longer pray
' cause if there were a god
he had let you stay
and tommorow i'll burn
our house to the ground
and we'll join u up there
' cause we no longer care
for our future our land
for the freedom to dance
wherever you are
we already went
