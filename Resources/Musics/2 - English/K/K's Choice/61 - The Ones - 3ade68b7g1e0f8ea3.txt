THE ONES

It was nice of you to come
I appreciate you stopping by
And I know you'd like to be here

You have somewhere else to go
Everyone always does
I appreciate your efforts to be supernaturaly nice
And I know it's not your fault that you're not God or 
Jesus Christ

To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
But I know I can't expect you to give as much as I do

When it's always about me
That's not who I wanna be
Do you forgive me Jesus
Silly (silly) silly ...

How far i'm willing to go
To assure myself of love
To make sure that I'm a part of who you are
And what you love

To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
But I'll try not to expect you to give as much as i do

To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
But I'll try not to expect you to give as much as i 

To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
To the ones who let me down, you really hurt me
But I'll try not to expect you to give as much as i think i do
