TIRED

Show me where you found your faith and
Does it help you sleep at night
I am not that complicated
I just need some time

Because it doesn't feel right
And I’m mostly very tired

Life is easy when you fake it
Right until you realize
Your happiness is unrelated
To anything you have inside

And it doesn’t feel right
And I’m mostly very tired

Every chance I get to distract myself
I won’t try to convince myself
That there's anything for real or
That we're sure of what we feel

Quiet time is underrated
I still can’t stand to be alone
That might be why I’m so unstable
Barely able to hold on

And I just don’t feel right
And I’m mostly very tired
