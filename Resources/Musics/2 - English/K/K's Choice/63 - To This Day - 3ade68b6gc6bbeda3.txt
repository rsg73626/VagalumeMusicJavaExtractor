TO THIS DAY

I'm waiting for the bus to come
I'm lying on a bench
thinking of a book I read
and wondering what it meant

I hear footsteps coming closer
it's an ordinary man
He comes up to me, shakes my hand
and asks me who I am

I'm paralysed, I can't talk or move
what could I say
and before I have the chance to think
I tell this man my name

He smiles and looks away
but I still don't know the answer to this day
