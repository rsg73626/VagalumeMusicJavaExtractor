I FALL ASLEEP

Asleep, asleep, I fall asleep
I'm never waking up
I wish I could accept me
But I think I'm giving up

There's so much love and beauty
Yet to come, I am aware
But what about the other things
I can no longer bear

Asleep, asleep, I fall asleep
I'm never waking up

Please, just let me be at peace
I want to feel the peace
I want to be the peace

Asleep, asleep, I fall asleep
