WINTER

You're crying but as long as it's transparent and not red
there's no real reason to be sad to the people who are
smiling, always happy, always gay they do not know
that the egdes of the mouth can move the other way.

You're freezing, the ice on which you nearly slipped outside
is in your body, in your mind, getting warmer you are
dreaming, quite useless but it feels okay to you
in a world tht's dreaming too, in a world in which you

Keep on searching for a thing sublime
when all you need is inside of you.
Everybody's waiting for springtime,
well winter can be cozy too.

Cherish the moments, cherish the key
that leads to sane insanity.
Cherish incompetence, cherish me
don't ever cherish somebody who

keeps on searching for a thing sublime.
When all you need is inside of you.
Everybody's waiting for springtime,
well winter can be cozy too
