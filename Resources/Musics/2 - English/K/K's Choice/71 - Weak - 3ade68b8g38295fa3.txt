WEAK

Lost in time can't count the words
I said when I thought they went unheard
All of those harsh thoughts so unkind
'Cos I wanted you

And now I sit here I'm all alone
So here sits a bloody mess, tears fly home
A circle of angels deep in war
'Cos I wanted you

weak as I am, no tears for you
weak as I am, no tears for you
weak as I am, I'm not ones fool
weak as I am

What am I now but love last hope
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
If I opened my heart, there'd be no space for air
'Cos I wanted you

Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, I'm no ones fool
Weak as I am

With this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?

With this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?

Weak as I am
Weak as I am
Weak as I am
Weak as I am, am, am
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?

Weak as I am
