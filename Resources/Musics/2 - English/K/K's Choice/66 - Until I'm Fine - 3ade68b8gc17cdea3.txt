UNTIL I'M FINE

Cracked this morning 
Worst and weak 
Tears roll from inside my cheek 
Strange timing
Opportunity knocks 
Sun comes up
Paradox 

Take the whole part of this whine 
Take a rope and tie these thoughts of mind out 
Until I'm Fine

Don't ask me if I'm hungry
I'm not sick 
Something's tearing me apart 
Brick by brick
And I feel guilty 
As I'll sigh
I'm feeling guilty 
Why do I 

Take your hands inside of mine 
To take a rope and tie these thoughts of mind out 
Until I'm Fine

Cracked this morning 
Worst and sad 
Or have I already told you that 
Forget my plans to grow a vine
You went dressed to burn these thoughts of mind 
Until I'm Fine
Until I'm Fine
