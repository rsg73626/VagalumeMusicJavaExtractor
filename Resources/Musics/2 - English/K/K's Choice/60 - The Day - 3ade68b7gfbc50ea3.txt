THE DAY

There must be something more I can buy in the store
And I can not ignore the resemblance
With a tune I have heard in a dream that referred
To a beautiful world in which everyone wears maroon


Surprise, surprise, bright light into my eyes
And in the red sky I saw angels fly by
And the angel of death standing next to me said
Now there's only one thing left to do for you, sing with me

Ooooooooooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooooooooooh

And they danced and they drank and they thought it was love
And they prayed and they thanked the great lord up above
For the money he gave them the sex and the booze
The American dream in which no one can lose
They didn't stop singing with tears in their eyes
Their mouths filled with chocolate and strawberry pies
They were all so excited, they were all very dumb
They had chosen to party the day they dropped the bomb

They dropped the bomb
They dropped the bomb

And they danced and they drank and they thought it was love
And they prayed and they thanked the great lord up above
For the money he gave them the sex and the booze
The American dream in which no one can lose
And they didnt stop singing with tears in their eyes
Their mouths filled with chocolate and strawberry pies
They were all so excited, they were all very dumb
They had chosen to party the day they dropped the bomb

They dropped the bomb
