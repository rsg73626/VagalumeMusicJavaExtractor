ALWAYS EVERYWHERE

You turn off the light, you kiss me good night
Mother, I know that I’m gonna be alright

And I just can't wait to grow up
Find my own life, be a good wife
And a smart one, I’m sure

I never took us for granted and I always knew
You and I are special
But I never knew how much I'd miss you

So much has changed and been rearranged
And I see that I’ve lost
What made me so young and incredibly strong
And never ever wrong
You were always there
'Cos you're always everywhere

I used to cry for no reason
And that's still the same
Except that I had adolescence to blame
But not now

Now I feel sad 'cos I don't know what’s true
And I miss thinking I could be just like you

So much has changed and been rearranged
And I see that I’ve lost
What made me so young and incredibly strong
And never ever wrong
So much has changed and been rearranged
And I see that I’ve lost
What made me so sure that I could endure
How hard it is to lose and lose and lose and live again
And never understand

You are always everywhere
You are always everywhere
You're always there
You're always there
You're always everywhere
You're always there
Cause you're always everywhere

You turn off the light, and kiss me goodnight
And mother, I know that I’m gonna be alright
