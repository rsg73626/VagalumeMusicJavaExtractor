JULIAN

I was feeling awful
and I had too much to drink
And I could only get a bit better
if I just knew what to think
I wanted to caress you
and to hold you in my arms
I wanted you to touch me 
while you strangle me with charms
Raise your glass for love, 
for Julian
I took you to my bedroom 
with just one thing to do
And only seconds later 
you were me
and I was you
And in silence there together,
with the moon born on that line
My mother woke me up
and asked me wether I was fine
This one goes out to you,
my Julian
You were too beautiful to look at
and to talk with far too kind
So all what's left is a picture of you
scratched inside my mind
Raise your glass for love,
for Julian,
for Julian.
