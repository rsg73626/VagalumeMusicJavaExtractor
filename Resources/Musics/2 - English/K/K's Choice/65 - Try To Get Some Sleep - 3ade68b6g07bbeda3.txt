TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP

There's a reason, 
so well hidden
Why was I torn apart from you
Like a song I've never written
like a joke without a clue
No, I don't want to close my eyes
and think of you
How I'd like to get you back
But he won't let me
How I'd like to sing the songs
We knew by heart
'Farewell' sounds really cheap 
for pain you left me
And it is growing mushrooms in my heart
No, I don't want to close my eyes
and think of you
I want to try to get some sleep
But it is hard, can't take the leap
(I'm going to try to get some sleep)
But I'm afraid to wake up
Do you realize 
I don't know what to do?
Did you become just an idea,
are you still real?
Do you still have that snapshot 
that I gave you?
Oh, don't answer me,
it wouldn't change the way I feel
Do you feel as if you're having a ball?
Oh, I guess, I hope 
you don't feel anything at all
I'm going to try to get some sleep
Join the great subconscious-club
I'm going to try to get some sleep
But I'm afraid to wake up
Try to get some sleep.
