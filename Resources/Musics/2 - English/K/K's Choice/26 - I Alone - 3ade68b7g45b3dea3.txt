I ALONE

It's easier not to be wise 
and measure these things by your brains 
I sank into Eden with you 
Alone in the church by and by 

I'll read to you here, save your eyes, 
You'll need them your boat is at sea 
Your anchor is up, you've been swept away 
and the greatest of teacher's won't hesistate 

to leave you there by yourself 
chained to fate 

I alone love you, 
I alone tempt you 
I alone love you, 
fear is not the end of this! 
I alone love you, 
I alone tempt you 
I alone love you 

It's easier not to be great, 
and measure these things by your eyes 
We long to be here by His resolve 
Alone in the church by and by 
to cradle the baby in space 

and leave you there by yourself 
chained to fate 

I alone love you, 
I alone tempt you 
I alone love you, 
fear is not the end of this! 
I alone love you, 
I alone tempt you 
I alone love you 
Yeah 

(I alone love you) 
(I alone tempt you) 
I alone love you 

Oh, now, we took it back too far 
only love can save us now 
all these riddles that you burn 
all come running back to you 
all these riddles that you hide 
only love can save us now 
all these riddles that you burn 
YEAH YEAH YEAH!! 

I alone love you, 
I alone tempt you 
I alone love you, 
fear is not the end of this! 
I alone love you, 
I alone tempt you, 
I alone love you, oh 

(I alone love you) I 
(I alone tempt you) I 
(I alone love you) I alone 
(I alone love you) I alone, I alone 
(I alone love you) I 
(I alone tempt you) I 
(I alone love you) I alone 
(I alone...)
