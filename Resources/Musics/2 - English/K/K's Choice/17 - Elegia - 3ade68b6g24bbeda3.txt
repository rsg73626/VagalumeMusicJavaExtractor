ELEGIA

Oh, God, I haven't read your book.
I'm sure it was divine,
especially the part
where you turned water into wine.

Oh, God, I want you to clear my mind.
It's covered with dirt.
And I want to taste your skin
one time before I taste the earth.

Oh, God, I apologize,
I didn't knock when I arrived.
Oh, God, I apologize,
i didn't say goodbye last night.
Oh, God.

Now I guess you have your way,
as I taste the earth today.
now I guess you have your way,
as I taste the earth today.
