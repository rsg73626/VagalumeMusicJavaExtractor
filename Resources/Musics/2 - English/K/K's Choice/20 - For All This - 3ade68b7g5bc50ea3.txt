FOR ALL THIS

For All This

I feel it too, try not to talk
Try not to think of why we're here
You guide me, hit me
Somewhere inside of me

And no one here to verify
No camera shooting what your eyes say
This way I might forget about today

Ooh how, good how
Wonderful it is
It almost makes me wanna think
There is a reason for all this

I used to be a disbeliever, love was unreal
Just like moviestars and crashing cars
And shooting stars and Star Wars
But it's true

Ooh how, good how
Wonderful it is
It almost makes me wanna think
