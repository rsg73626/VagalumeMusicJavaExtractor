CHRISTMAS DON'T BE LATE

[verse]
Christmas, christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
I've been good, but I can't last
Hurry christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, christmas, don't be late

[outro]
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I still want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, christmas, don't be late
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, christmas, don't be late
