A WILLIE NICE CHRISTMAS (FEAT. WILLIE NELSON, TRIGGER)

[verse 1: kacey musgraves]
I'm gonna wrap my presents up in red bandanas
And leave some special cookies out for santa
Throw my troubles to the wind
'til we're back on the road again
Here's to finding
Your own little piece on earth

[chorus: kacey musgraves]
And I hope you have a really
A really, really, willie nice christmas
If you're in luckenbach or waikiki
Yeah, I hope you have a really
A really, really, willie nice christmas
And may we all stay higher
Than the angel on top of the tree
[verse 2: willie nelson]
Don't get caught up in the hustle
And the bustle
This time of year ain't supposed
To be so stressful
Here's to easily silent nights
And finding your own paradise
'cause whatever family, might call your own

[chorus: both]
And I hope you have a really
A really, really, willie nice christmas
And may it be a lot more green than blue
Yeah, I hope you have a really
A really, really, willie nice christmas
And, willie, happy new year, too
