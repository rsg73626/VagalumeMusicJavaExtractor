CHRISTMAS MAKES ME CRY

[verse 1]
It's all red and gold
And nat king cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights
And snowy nights and kids still believe
And I know that they say
"have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but christmas, it always makes me cry

[verse 2]
It's the ones we miss
No one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by
Just one more that I
I couldn't make it home
And I know that they say
"have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear I sincerely try
Oh, but christmas, it always makes me cry
Always
[verse 3]
Seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts
Just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad
Getting a little grayer
And they always say, "have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but christmas, it always makes me cry
