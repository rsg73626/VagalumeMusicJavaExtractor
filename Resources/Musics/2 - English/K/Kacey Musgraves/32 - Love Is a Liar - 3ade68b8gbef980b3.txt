LOVE IS A LIAR

You take another pill just to kill another hour
ha
and then you're smokin' cigarettes
and you're countin' dead flowers
'cause you're crazy
and screwed two ways from Tuesday

Love is a liar
makes you think you're on a high
When you're really just on a high wire
If love were pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

Candy coated promises they're always tryin' to sell ya
But there's a whole lot of stories
That the books never tell ya
and you're cryin' and sleepin' in your clothes

'Cause love is a liar
makes you think you're on a high
when you're really just on a high wire
If love were pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
'cause the grass is always greener
through the rose covered cracks
There's a reason for the pain is what they say if you ask
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass

'Cause you're crazy
and screwed two ways from Tuesday
'cause love is a liar
makes you think you're on a high
when you're really just on a high wire
If love were pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar
yeah, love is a liar
(here we go good two three
always push you in your face can't eat can't sleep
why's it always gotta be a liar)
