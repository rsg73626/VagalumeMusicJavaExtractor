STEP OFF

You sure look pretty in your glass house
You probably think you're too good to take the trash out
Well are you dumb or are you blind
Cause it's a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning a knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

Step off, step off
Yeah you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
I'm just trying to make a difference here
So why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain, your dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Yeah

Screwed everybody over in this town
There ain't nothing between you and the cold hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
Whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

So step off, step off
Yeah you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just trying to make a difference here
So why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain, your dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top

Sticks and stones may build a throne but
You'll be up there all alone

So step off
Yeah yeah step off
Keep climbing that mountain your dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off, step off, step off
