LET IT SNOW (FEAT. THE QUEBE SISTERS)

[verse 1: kacey musgraves]
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, jet it snow, let it snow
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, jet it snow, let it snow

[chorus: the quebe sisters]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
[verse 2: kacey musgraves]
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, jet it snow, let it snow

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, jet it snow, let it snow
