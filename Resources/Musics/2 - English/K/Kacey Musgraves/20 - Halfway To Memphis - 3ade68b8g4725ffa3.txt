HALFWAY TO MEMPHIS

I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
Take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
You drove me outta' my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

Instead of wastin' my time trying to make you feel good
I'm gonna see what kinda' life is up in front of my hood
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
**I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis**

I can drive away far and I can run pretty fast
The plan for my future's puttin' you in my past
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

So don't bother to call and don't bother to write
Cuz' freedom's just ahead in the beam of my lights
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

Chorus 2x

Repeat: I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
You can take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
