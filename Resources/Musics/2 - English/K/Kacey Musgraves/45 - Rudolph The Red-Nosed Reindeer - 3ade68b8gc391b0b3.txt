RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER

[intro]
Well, here's one for all the little kids
You know dasher and dancer
And prancer and vixen
Comet and cupid and donner and blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

[verse]
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
Well, and if you ever saw it
You would even say it glowed
(like a light bulb)
All of the other reindeer used
To laugh and call him names
Oh, they never let poor rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Oh, then one foggy christmas eve
Oh, santa came to say (ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (hee hee)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
[outro]

Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (hee hee)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
Yeah, you'll go down, go down in history
