WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE?

When the bells all ring
And the horns all blow
And the couples
That we know are finally kissing
Will I be with you
Or will I be among the missing?

Maybe it's much too early in the game
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing new year's, new year's eve?
Wonder whose arms
Will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly 12 o'clock midnight
Welcoming in the new year, new year's eve

Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive

Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
