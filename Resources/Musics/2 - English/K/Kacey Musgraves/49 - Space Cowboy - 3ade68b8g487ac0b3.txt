SPACE COWBOY

You look out the window
While I look at you
Sayin' I don't know
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run
there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies
that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
There ain't room for both of us in this town

So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run
ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Oh, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run
ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space
Cowboy
