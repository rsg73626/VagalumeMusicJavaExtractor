APOLOGIZE

Holdin on your rope
Got me 10 feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that your sorry
Didn't think I 'd turn around
And say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I'd take another chance
Take a shot
Take a fall for you
And I need you
Like a heart needs a beat
But that's nothing new
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
And im afraid
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's to late to apologize
It's to late
Woah oh woah
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's to late to apologize
It's too late
Yeah
I said its too late to apologize
Yeah
I'm holdin' on your rope
Got me 10 feet off the ground
