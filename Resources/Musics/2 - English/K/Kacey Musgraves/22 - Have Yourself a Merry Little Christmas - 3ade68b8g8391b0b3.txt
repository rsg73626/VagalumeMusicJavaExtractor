HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS

[verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little christmas
Make the yule-tide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

[verse 2]
Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
[verse 3]
Through the years
We all will be together if the fates allow
So hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough
And have yourself
A merry little christmas now

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

[verse 3]
Through the years
We all will be together if the fates allow
So hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough
And have yourself
A merry little christmas now
