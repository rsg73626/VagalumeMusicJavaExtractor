MELE KALIKIMAKA (FEAT. THE QUEBE SISTERS)

[verse 1: kacey musgraves]
Mele kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright hawaiian christmas day
That's the island greeting
That we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway
Here, we know that christmas
Will be green and bright
The sun will shine by day
And all the stars at night
Mele kalikimaka is hawaii's way
To say merry christmas to you
