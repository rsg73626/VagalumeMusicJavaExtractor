BLOWIN' SMOKE

Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus
From Vegas
We're all out here talking trash
Making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good
To be a waitress

Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in
We'll just sail away

But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm out here going broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

Well Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten
And longer
Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's about to graduate
From college

I'm just flicking ash
Into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm out here going broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin'

We all say that we'll
Quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake
We all say that we'll
Quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm out here going broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
