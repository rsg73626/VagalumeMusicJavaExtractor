BUTTERFLIES

I was just coastin'
Never really goin anywhere
Caught up in a web
I was gettin kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

Now you're lifting me up, instead of holding me down
Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, mhm
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder
where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt
till you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down
Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, mhm
You give me butterflies

Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down
Taking my hand instead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied

I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, mhm
You give me butterflies
