RIBBONS AND BOWS

[chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

[verse 1]
Don't get me wrong
A shiny new mercedes
Would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket
For a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

[pre-chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find
And it's already mine

[chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can light me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'cause I just need your love

[verse 2]
All the ladies down at the hair salon
Are gonna brag about what they got
I walk in drippin' in their bobbles
And trinkets and their [?] and whatnots

[pre-chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

[chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can light me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'cause I just need your love

[bridge]
Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

[chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can light me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'cause I just need your love
