I WANT A HIPPOPOTAMUS FOR CHRISTMAS

[verse 1]
I want a hippopotamus for christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a doll, no dinky tinker toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for christmas
I don't think santa claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

[chorus]
I can see me now on christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there
[verse 2]
I want a hippopotamus for christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me, too

[verse 3]
Mom says the hippo would eat me up
But then
My teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
There's lots of room for him
In our two car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there
And give him his massage

[chorus]
I can see me now on christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

[verse 2]
I want a hippopotamus for christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses-es
I only like hippopotamuses-es
And hippopotamuses like me, too
