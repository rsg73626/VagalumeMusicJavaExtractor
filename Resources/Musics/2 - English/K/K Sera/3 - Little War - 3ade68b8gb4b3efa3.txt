LITTLE WAR

Have a little War. Have a little war for
Everything I am, everything I could be.
Don't let me fall before my feet hit the ground.
Take a little time. Take a little time to
Understand that I can't go on with
My heart and my mind living on two different shores.

To the sound of falling apart
You let your pride closer than me.
Left in a room falling apart
Learning to walk then run.

In another life, in another life we
Could have had it all but we lost it.
Fired all our guns at those who matter most.
I've seen better days with my eyes closed.
Holding on to those words that you said.
You're sick because you'll never know how lucky you are.

To the sound of falling apart
You let your pride closer than me.
Left in a room falling apart
Learning to walk then run.

Have a little War. Have a little war for
Everything I am, everything I could be.
Don't let me fall before my feet hit the ground.

To the sound of falling apart
You let your pride closer than me.
Left in a room falling apart
Learning to walk then run.
As fast as I can!

So get away from anyone who ever told me I was wrong.
I wanted things that I deserve and knowing that I simply.
Here will be the death of me.
Extreme will be the reason why I miss home.
