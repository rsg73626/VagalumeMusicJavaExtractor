CONSIDER YOURSELF

Dear love, I write to tell you I,
I won a battle but lost the war.
So take my hand it's gonna be a lonely road from here.
Just stay close where I can see.
Please don't go. Please don't go.
Please don't.

Two years ago, I never thought that I'd
Ever see the coast like this,
Be in Poland on a 4th of July.
But the road I chose, it took me far away from you
And my new home that I can't risk.
So please don't go. Please don't go.

I need your skin to keep me warm at night.
I'm drifting away.
I'm floating in the cold.
I Feel it in my bones.
Give me something to hold.

So tell me now, If I wrote a song that gave you reason to stay
Would you ever listen to the words I wrote.
These notes in my throat
For you. So tell me now.

Oh God, I, I fell in love
With someone without a heart, someone without a heart.
And oh God, I, I fell in love
With someone without a heart, someone without a heart.
Please don't go, Please don't go.
