AND SO IT GOES

I've been told this or the pencil.
What comes out of my mouth next.
Well I fail to see the problem
While my, eyes stay this red.
Now my best friend hangs up.
I write my words down
But I only speak the truth,
And the truth is a lie to everyone I've ever known.

But I've still got time to find another way out.
So as my heart beats, you sing along.
Sing me that same old song
Beginning itself and losing everything you had.
Like when you thought that life was so predictable.
Time left your dead friend hanging on the wall.

And so it goes am I dead or just lost in conversation.
I'm drowning in a sea of people who mean nothing to me.
So I've got these big city lights,
Lighting up the black empty sky.
Lye in wait for this time to open up and swallow me whole

But I've still got time to find another way out.
So as my heart beats, you sing along.
Sing me that same old song
Beginning itself and losing everything you had.
Like when you thought that life was so predictable.
Time left your dead friend hanging on the wall.

And I've still got time to find another way out.
So as my heart beats, you sing along.
Sing me that same old song
Beginning itself and losing everything you had.
Like when you thought that life was so predictable.
Time left your dead friend hanging on the wall.
