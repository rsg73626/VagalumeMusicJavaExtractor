[Chorus]
I'm in Miami and the girls are eye candy
I'm pushin eighty on the freeway strip
Switchin lanes with the souped up whip
Spittin games like a seventies pimp
And I just stopped in

I'm in Miami and the girls are eye candy
I'm pushin eighty on the freeway strip
Switchin lanes with the souped up whip
No lie we roll, we ride, we, we dangerous

[Verse 1]
Hey yo mami, I just got in Miami
We gonna party at the beach, better get at me
We gonna party with my peeps, you and your chicas (hot little mamacita)
That's for sugar

It's on you, what you gonna do?
When I roll through in my souped up Coupe
Baby it's amigo
Push the pedal to the floor (pedal to the floor) (hey yo, ma what's up)
Push the pedal to the floor, then my dub still spins

And I just wanna be the one to please ya

Push the pedal to the floor (and I tell ya girl)

Push the pedal to the floor and my dub still spins
