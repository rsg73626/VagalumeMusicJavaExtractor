I'LL NEVER FORGET

I fell in love with you the first time I saw you
I'm so proud of you; I don't know what to do
Baby, I swear I wanted to

Tell you how I feel, baby I'm for real
You got me under a spell
Everything has changed
Loving you is plain
It's nothing I've ever felt

Could it be I'm helplessly?
So much in love, it's killing me
I love you even more each day
With you it's where I'll always wanna be

Whenever we touch, whenever we kiss, I'm falling in love all over again
I still remember when I first touched your lips
It's like a feeling I'll never forget
[Repeat]

And you are the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the earth,
You're my girl, baby you're my world
And you are the air I breathe, making my heart beat
Baby, can't you see
That I really care for, I'll be there for you
Like the first time I touched your lips, only took one kiss
That's when I knew you would be mine (leader)

Whenever we touch, whenever we kiss, I'm falling in love all over again
I still remember when I first touched your lips
It's like a feeling I'll never forget
[Repeat]

With you is where I always want to be

Whenever we touch, whenever we kiss, I'm falling in love all over again
I still remember when I first touched your lips
It's like a feeling I'll never forget
[Repeat]
