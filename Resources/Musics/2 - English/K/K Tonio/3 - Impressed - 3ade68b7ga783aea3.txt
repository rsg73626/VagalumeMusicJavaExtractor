IMPRESSED

romeo and juliet
louis and ms. antoinette
napoleon and josephine
mickey and the rodent queen

antony and cleopatra
nicholas and alexandra
ken and barbie, dick and jane
superman and lois lane

impressed
i am not impressed
i love you the best
i am not impressed
it's a bunch of losers
a lot of fools
a list of victims
not all that cool
and we've got nothing in this world
to live up to

i'll never kill you this i swear
then kill myself just to be fair
i'll never need another queen
we'll never face the guillotine

because love is gentle love is kind
Doesn't poison baby's wine
isn't jealous or provoked
doesn't quit or give up hope

impressed
i am not impressed
forget all the rest
i am not impressed
it's just a bunch of losers
it's a lot of fools
it's a long list of victims
it's got nothing to do with me and you
