ROMEO AND JANE

i've heard of unfaithful lovers but this is outrageous
soon the national enquirer will run the front pages
i saw shakespeare and cheetah 
crying in their margaritas
bad news

romeo loves jane
the jungle will never be the same
and juliet's crying again
romeo loves jane

now in a wold full of hurt how can anybody blame them
and in the heat of wild love how can anybody tame them
they have fallen east of eden now

good love gone bad
bad love gone wild
wild love gone mad
mad love out of control
