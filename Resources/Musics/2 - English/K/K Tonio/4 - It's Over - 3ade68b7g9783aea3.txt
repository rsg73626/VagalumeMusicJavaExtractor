IT'S OVER

"Mest" "It's Over"

(VERSE:)
You've been waiting for
You never knew for sure
Cause time was goin' by
And never asked you why

When I would talk to you
The words they went right through
Your head

But I couldn't tell
You were under her spell
She had full control
No one would ever know

How much you didn't care
Just like Sonny not Cher
The beat didn't go on

(CHORUS:)
She looked at you and she said to your face
It's over, it's over
She's got a new man and it's time for you
To move over, move over
You're drunk and mad you wish that you
Were sober, were sober
Cause now you can't get it out of your head
That it's over, that it's over, that it's over

(VERSE:)
She said she doesn't know
It's like the Springer show
She said that she loves you
But that she loves him too

So you keep holdin' on
Your love for her is strong
Until she says so long
And you did nothin' wrong

But this keeps happening
Time and time again
You're thinkin' to yourself
She was your only friend

But you're so fucking wrong
That you're so fucking lame
You realize you're all the same

(CHORUS:)
She looked at you and she said to your face
It's over, it's over
She's got a new man and it's time for you
To move over, move over
You're drunk and mad you wish that you
Were sober, were sober
Cause now you can't get it out of your head
That it's over, that it's over, that it's over
Cause it's over, it's over, it's over
And it's over, it's over, it's over

(BRIDGE:)
Tell them lies and they will believe you
When you're honest they will deceive you
If you love them they will just leave you
But if you play them they will stay with you

Tell them lies and they will believe you
When you're honest they will deceive you
If you love them they will just leave you
But if you play them they will be with you

And I'll be here when she says

(CHORUS:)
She looked at you and she said to your face
It's over, it's over
She's got a new man and it's time for you
To move over, move over
You're drunk and mad you wish that you
Were sober, were sober
Cause now you can't get it out of your head
That it's over, that it's over, that it's over
Cause it's over 
She said I'm sorry it's over
(Well it's over, it's over, it's over)
She said I'm sorry it's over
(And it's over, it's over, it's over)
She said I'm sorry it's over
(And it's over, it's over, it's over)
She said I'm sorry it's over
(And it's over, it's over, it's over)
