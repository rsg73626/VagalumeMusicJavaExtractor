STAY

These aren't the greatest days for love
It's such a fallen world
It's such a dangerous place
It's so hard to find someone to trust
So easy to get hurt
So hard to get a break
So many broken hearts
So many broken homes
Don't wanna even try sometimes
It's safer to be alone

Stay, darlin' stay
I know you wanna run
I know you're so afraid
Stay, darlin' stay
This doesn't have a thing to do with yesterday

I've been looking all my life for you
I didn't know your name
But I knew I'd know you anywhere
You've been out looking for me, too
Well, honey here we are
It's like the answer to a prayer, or something

Darlin' stay
This ain't no accident
This isn't any mistake
Stay, darlin' stay
Honey, don't give in just when you're finally safe

Now this is not the golden age of kindness
And you haven't had a lot of luck with love
But honey, that was then, and this is real
And I'm not them, this is a whole new deal

So stay, darlin' stay
Ain't gonna do no good
For you to run away
Stay, darlin' stay
This doesn't have a thing to do with yesterday
Darlin' stay
I know you wanna run, I know you're so afraid
Darlin' stay
Ain't gonna prove a thing
For you to throw it all away
So darlin' stay
