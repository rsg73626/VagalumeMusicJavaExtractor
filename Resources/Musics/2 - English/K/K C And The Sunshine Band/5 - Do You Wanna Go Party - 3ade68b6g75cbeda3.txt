DO YOU WANNA GO PARTY

Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Do you wanna go party
We'll get funky there, party
Drink a little wine, party
Have a funky time, party
Come on baby, sexy lady
Let's go out tonight
We'll go party
we'll go dancin'
Let's go get satisfied
Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Como on baby, sexy lady
Let yourself unwind
I wanna love you
Kiss and hug you
Make it last all night
Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party

Ooh, ah, party
Ooh, ah, party
Do you wanna go party
We'll get funky there, party
Drink a little wine, party
Have a funky time, party
Ooh, ah

Ooh, ah

Do you wanna go party

Do you wanna go party
We'll get funky there, party
Drink a little wine, party
Have a funky time, party
Party
