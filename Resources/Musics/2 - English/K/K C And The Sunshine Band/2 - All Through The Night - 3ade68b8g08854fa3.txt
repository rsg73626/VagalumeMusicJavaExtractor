ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT

Spoken:
You know, girl
You're so busy reaching for a dream
That doesn't even exist
You can't even see someone

Who's standing right here
Who loves you so much
And i've tried
Oh i've tried
But i want you to still know this
That all you got to do is reach out for me
And i'll be there
Anytime you want me

All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And you feel the magic
Don't be afraid

Quit searchin'
Anticipatin'
Stop reachin'
For that distant star

I been waiting
Girl don't pass the moment
The light's right before your very eyes

All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic
Don't be afraid

Quit dreamin'
You're so mistaken
A perfect stranger
Will never call

Stop wishin'
If you want let good be
Me waiting at your door

All through the night

Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic
Don't be afraid

All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic
Don't be afraid

Stop searchin' girl
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin', yeah
Stop searchin', oh yeah
Why don't you stop it
Quit searchin', anticipatin'
Stop reachin'
For that distant star
I've been waitin'
Girl don't pass the moment
The lights right before your very eyes

All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic
Don't be afraid

All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And if you feel the magic
Don't be afraid
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Stop searchin'
Cause i'm right here
