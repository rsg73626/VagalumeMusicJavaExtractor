KEEP IT COMIN' LOVE

Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Don't let your well run dry, don't
Don't give me no reasons why,
Don't stop it now
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Don't build me up just to let me down
Don't stop it now
Don't turn me on just to turn me off
Don't stop it now.
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Don't tell me there ain't no more,
Don't stop it now.
Don't turn me down and just
close your door, don't stop it now.

Keep it comin' love
Ooh, keep it comin' love, Oh yeah
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Don't stop it now, don't stop it, no no
Don't stop it now, don't stop it.
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
Keep it comin' love, keep it comin' love
