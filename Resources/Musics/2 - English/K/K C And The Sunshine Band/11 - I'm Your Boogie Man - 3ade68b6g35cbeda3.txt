I'M YOUR BOOGIE MAN

I'm your boogie man, that's what I am.
I'm here to do whatever I can.
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight. It's never too soon
To want to please you,
To want to keep you
To want to do it all, all for you
I wanna be your, be your rubber ball.
I wanna be the boy ya love most of all. Oh yeah.

Chorus:
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
Turn me on!
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
I'll do what you want.
(Repeat)

I'm your boogie man, that's what I am.
I'm here to do whatever I can.
Be it early morning, late afternoon.
Or at midnight. Aww it's never too soon
To want to take you, to want to hold you.
I want to give my all, all to you.
And I want you to completely understand.
Wherever I'm at, and wherever I am, oh yeah.

I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
Turn me on!
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
I'll do what you want.
(Repeat)

I'm your boogie man, that's what I am.
I'm here to do whatever I can.
Be it early morning, late afternoon.
Or at midnight. Aww it's never too soon
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Yeah be together, you and me
I wanna see you, oh get near you,
I wanna love you up, from sundown sunup.
oh yeah - oh Yeah!

<interlude>

I'm your boogie man, that's what I am.
I'm here to do whatever I can.
Be it early mornin, late afternoon.
Or at midnight. Aww it's never too soon
To want to please you, to want to hold you
