GIVE IT UP

Everybody wants you, everybody wants your love 
I´d just like to make you mine, oh, mine 

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now 
Baby give it up, give it up, baby give it up 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now 
Baby give it up, give it up, baby give it up 

Everybody sees you, everybody looks and stares 
I´d just like to make you mine, oh, mine 

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now 
Baby give it up, give it up, baby give it up 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now 
Baby give it up, give it up, baby give it up

Come on baby, I want your love 

Give it up, some of your love 
Come on and play the game of love 

Everybody feels with me, give it up

Can I touch you, can I love you 
Come on baby, baby, I love you 

Can you give it, give it up 
Come on baby, give me your love
