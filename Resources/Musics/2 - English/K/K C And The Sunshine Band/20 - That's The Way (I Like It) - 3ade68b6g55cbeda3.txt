THAT'S THE WAY (I LIKE IT)

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

When you take me by the hand,
tell me I'm your lovin man
When you give me all your love and do it
Babe, the very best you can

Oh, That's the way I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

When I get to be in your arms,
when we're all all alone
When you whisper sweet in my ear,
when you turn, turn me on.

Oh, that's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

Say O.K. That's the way, that's the way
Say O.K. That's the way, that's the way
That's the way, I like it
That's the way, I like it

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it

Say O.K. That's the way, that's the way
Say O.K. That's the way, that's the way
