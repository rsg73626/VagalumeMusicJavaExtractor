YES, I'M READY

I don´t even know how to love you
Just the way you want me too baby
But i´m ready to love, yes, i´m ready to love
To fall in love, to fall in love, to fall in love with you
Oh, oh baby
I don´t even know how to hold your hand
Just make you understand
But i´m ready to love, yes, i´m ready to love
To hold your hand, make you understand, to hold your hand
I´m ready now, oh, yeh, yeh
I don´t even know to kiss your lips
In a moment life fells one moment
But i don´t learn how took
All the things you want me took, yeh
Are you ready?

To fall in love, to fall in love, to fall in love with you
Are you ready?

To fall in love, to fall in love, to fall in love with you
Are you ready?

To love you, hold you, kiss you, want you, sqize you, need you
