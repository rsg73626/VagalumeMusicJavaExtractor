MADNESS OF THE MUSIC

honey i can tell by one real look in your eyes,
you're just a little boy,just about a thousand miles...

And the girl you say is always on your mind,
you just sit and watch,let get out of your life

cause, while you talkin low and you changin your sheets in me,
you doing things that i don't like,
it ain't right,
weather it must be the madness,
and the music that i feel inside,

I wanna tell you i love you, i love you,
but i can't deny,
.
a boom-bigge,and boom-bigge,
digge-dige-dige-de-yeaaaa,
ohhhhhhhhhh.

.....................must be the madness and 
the magic of the music that i feel inside,
madness of the rhytm and the geo-graphy
playin with my side........

......boom-bigge-boom-bigee,digge-digge-digge-de-yeaaaaaa
......ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
