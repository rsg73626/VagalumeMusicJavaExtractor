IT'S THE SAME OLD SONG

You're sweet as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favourite song
The one we dance to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's teh same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
To hear an old love song
And wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Everytime I hear our favourite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music (used to dance to the music)
Make romance through the music

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
(repeat)
