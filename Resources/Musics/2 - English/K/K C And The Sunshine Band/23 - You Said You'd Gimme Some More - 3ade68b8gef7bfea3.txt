YOU SAID YOU'D GIMME SOME MORE

Liar, liar

Telling me a bag of lies
You don't mean a thing you say tonight
You promised me days and days
Now you’re gonna go and change your ways
I've seen you 'round somebody else
You must be doin' something else
You said you'd gimme some more

You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more

No, no, no, no
Liar, liar, liar

Why you wanna do this to me
I've been so good to you, can't you see
I've given everything you want
But seems to make no difference at all
I want your body, I need it now
I need some lovin', I need it somehow
Baby, you'd gimme some more

You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more
You said you'd gimme some more

No, no, no, no
Don’t stop what you’re doing (no, no)
You said you'd gimme some more
Don’t stop what you’re doing (no, no)
You said you'd gimme some more

Don’t stop what you’re doing (no, no)
You said you'd gimme some more
Don’t stop what you’re doing (no, no)
You said you'd gimme some more
Don’t stop what you’re doing (no, no)
You said you'd gimme some more
