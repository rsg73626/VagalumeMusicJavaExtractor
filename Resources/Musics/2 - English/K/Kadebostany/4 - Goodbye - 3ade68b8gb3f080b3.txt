GOODBYE

Goodbye, and never come back
My back is not heavy enough to carry you on my shoulder
Goodbye, just disappear in the sky, in the sky
We used to be the powder of the stars
But now we're just the dust of the tears

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Now you gotta follow your path
Until you would see the light
Oh no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more fight

I'm not ready for this again
Oh goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
My ex sweet lover
My piano is my only true and faithful friend
and faithful friend
You're the shadow of the stars, of the stars
We're the shadow of the stars
Come, come closer, come closer, come closer
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
