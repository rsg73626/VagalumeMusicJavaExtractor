BUGS & FLOWERS

Bugs and flowers sample the corpses
Their feelers stroke them for ages
What a nice pleasure
What a wonderful leisure
The wind as a cherished friend
Announces his delightful end
Can't you hear them laughing

There is no reason to be afraid
You will feel great in this glade
Spirits are dancing
Their tears are melting
Our mystical experience is waiting for you
