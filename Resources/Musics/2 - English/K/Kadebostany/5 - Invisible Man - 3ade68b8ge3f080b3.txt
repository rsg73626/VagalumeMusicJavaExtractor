INVISIBLE MAN

I'll be there next to you
I'll be your hidden light in the dark
If you take the time to look around
If you take the time to look around
I know you feel sad, it's hard nobody understands you
I'll be your light in the dark
I'll be your light in the dark

I know what you've been through
I'm your one and only friend
I'm an invisible man
I know what you've been through
I'm your one and only friend
I'm an invisible man

Look at the sky
And try to grab a star
No matter if you shy
The end is not far
Look at the light
No need to fight
We have a solution
It's not an illusion
Just listen to my voice that would show you the way
Sometimes it's hard for you to survive
Everything seems so grey
You don't know why but you gotta believe in me
I know you will be free
Just count 'til one two three

I know what you've been through
I'm your one and only friend
I'm an invisible man
I know what you've been through
I'm your one and only friend
I'm an invisible man

I'll be there next to you
I'll be your hidden light in the dark
if you take the time to look around
if you take the time to look around
I'll be your light in the dark

I know what you've been through
I'm your one and only friend
I'm an invisible man
I know what you've been through
I'm your one and only friend
I'm an invisible man
