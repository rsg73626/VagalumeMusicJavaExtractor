K-AIRLINE

When I walk around this city
I feel like I could give all of me
And when they sing this kind of melody
I hold myself and feel a bit melancholy

I run from home for a sweet escape
Took an aeroplane for my favourite state
I wanna be a part of this country
I wanna live in kadebostany
Here people are singing all night long
The wind is like a beautiful song
I hear your sound big and round
Lost and found

The president is watching you
Be careful what you do
The president is watching you
Be careful what you do

Don't call me a runaway
Oh please I really I wanna stay
I'm not only a turisty
I'm deeply in love with this city
Here you cannot be thirsty
Cos the vodka is for free
Stamp your postcard have them sent
Say hi to the president
Say hi to the president

When I walk around this city
I feel like I could give all of me
And when they sing this kind of melody
I hold myself and feel a bit melancholy
When I walk around this city
I feel like I could give all of me
And when they sing this kind of melody
I hold myself and feel a bit melancholy
