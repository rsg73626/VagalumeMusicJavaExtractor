THE WILDERNESS

Ain't nothing new under the sun
A poor man's work is never done
So much is always on your mind
You're too cold or too kind
So many years just getting by man
You're so busy living or too busy dying
Trying

We've cried out since you were a child
A wilderness within the wild
And we're screaming from the choir
If God is a fire
Burning in a tree
Then why won't he speak to me
We're tired out here in the field
And all of us need to be healed
So I tore you down and built a wall
And it's a hundred living lovers tall

Searching for the truth
That you lost in your youth
And now you're standing still
Like life is just time that you kill
The birds they eat the fish
The men they eat the birds
And the men are eaten by the worms
Lost in the wilderness
Are we lost in the wilderness?
