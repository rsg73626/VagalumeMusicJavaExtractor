BECAUSE YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE

When ever I around you
I go home a little bit
There's just something about you
Where the pieces all fit

There's a lightness that surrounds you
And it guides me like a star
Who I am, who I am
Because you are who you are

Put your hand in my hand
When I'm made brand new
Somehow you just gonna stay
You always know just what to do

Even when you are away
You never all that far
Who I am, who I am
Because you are who you are

Truth is this and don't forget
That my world better cause you're in it

There's a lightness that surround you
And it guides me like a star
Who I am, who I am
Because you are who you are
