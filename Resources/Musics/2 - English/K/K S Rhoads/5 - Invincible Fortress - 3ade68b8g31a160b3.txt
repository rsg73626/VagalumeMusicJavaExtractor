INVINCIBLE FORTRESS

I'm seeking the place
In infinite space
Deep beneath the rising sun
Asleep like a lion and her young
The light in his calls
Beyond enemy walls
From the billowing smoke that began you
Your love, your lost, together again
An invincible fortress
Oh oh
Oh oh
An invincible fortress

I see a child
Broken home
Blood by tears
Crying out the window
For the first of many things that will come to pass
The dogs are put to sleep
And dreams are meant to be
You will wake up and the best is behind you
Don't forget, it ain't over yet
I'm here to remind you

You're an invincible fortress
Oh oh
Oh oh
You're an invincible fortress
Oh oh
Oh oh
You're an invincible fortress

You're an invincible fortress
You're an invincible fortress
Invincible fortress
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
You're an invincible fortress
