HARVEST

You're out on a mission
You're gonna settle a score
You got trigger happy
But you don't know who you're gunning for

There's too many fingerprints
You don't know who to blame
Only you got a bullet
And that bullet's got a name

There are those who are guilty
And they will never get caught
They reign on the justice that can be bought
They steal from the old woman
To put the young man into war

Keep the people busy fighting
And they'll forget what they were fighting for
The harvest is coming
Oh, you know that
The harvest is coming

Now is the mission dog hour
To find the masters head
They hold on to the power
As long as we don't understand

But there will come a reaping
When the weed is burned
For right know they have a seat at a table
But the table will be overturned
Because the harvest is coming

Oh, the harvest is coming
The harvest is coming
