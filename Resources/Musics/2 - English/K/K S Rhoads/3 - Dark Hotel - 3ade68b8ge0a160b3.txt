DARK HOTEL

My voice is broken
Got a broken string, a broken wing
And everything makes me wanna cry
And my only love's gone away to stay
Can't even look forward to the end of the day
To come home to her at night
Oh, lord, give me peace
And put my sorry, singin', sad old soul to ease

And bring me hope
I need a little, just a little
Give me strength
I need a little, just a little
An offering of faith
I need a little, just a little
Bring me hope
I need a little so I can hold on

A dreamer in a dark hotel
Like a silver coin drowin' at the bottom of a well
The blue bird's back, singin' in the willow
Washin' his wings in the water in my pillow
So wake me up in autumn leaves
To the part of me that still believes
There's beauty on the other side of the river

Oh, lord, give me peace
And put my sorry, singin', sad old soul to ease
And bring me hope
I need a little, just a little
Give me strength
I need a little, just a little
An offering of faith
I need a little, just a little
Bring me hope
I need a little so I can hold on

Oh, get me out of this wishing well
A dreamer dying in a dark hotel
Break me out of this prison cell
Only love can save me now
