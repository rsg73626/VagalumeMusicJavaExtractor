COULD THIS BE LOVE

We sank into the sand like starfish in the sea
Pioneers upon new land like manifest destiny
Into each other's treasure: Lost, and sunken ships
As one by one I lift the grains of sand of stone from off her lips
And I found new fears in between the life that light her eyes
For when beauty comes to life, some other beauty always dies
And by the sunrise and the pumpkin patches would I soon be missing
Brought back to life by the face that was formed from my kissing

Could this be love? Love?
And into the air rose I upon metallic bird
The slight case of her face oft upon my lips like unspoken words
And had I known her better I would have missed this light
To see her once again swim in her secrets in the belly of the night
And there below the train yards lay like sinister smiles
With boxcars going back to her for too many love long whiles
Puppets under parachutes could leave this bird of metal
And fall upon her autumn hair with drops of morning seem to settle in the sun

Could this be love? Love?
Could this be love? Love?
Could this be love? Love?

If you're going to kiss me like that, be careful
If you're going to kiss me like that, be true
If you're going to kiss me like that, be careful
'Cause each new time you kiss me, I miss you
If you're going to kiss me like that, be careful
If you're going to kiss me like that, be real
If you're going to kiss me like that, be careful
'Cause each new time you kiss me, I heal

We sank into the sand like two starfish lost in the deep blue sea
(Could this be love?)
And the boxcars going back to you, oh baby why can't I be?
(Could this be love?)
Oh, some things were meant to last, and some things were meant to fade
(Could this be love?)
If I had to go, then I'll never know, could this be love?
Could this be love?
