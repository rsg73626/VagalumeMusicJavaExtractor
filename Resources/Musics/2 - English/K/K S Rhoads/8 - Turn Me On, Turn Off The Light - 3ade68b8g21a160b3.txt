TURN ME ON, TURN OFF THE LIGHT

I live on the fourth floor above a bar
I kinda wanna go in
Go find a pretty girl, ask for her number
And never see her again

Say that you love me and I'll
Be right back in no hurry
'Cause it's a lonely life
And I can't change overnight
So just turn me on
And turn off the light

I'll go and pull up a stool
Real cool, light up a cigarette
Look brilliant and mean
And then that girl will come over
And tap me on the shoulder
And I'll talk just like james dean

And if she says that she'll love me
And I'll be right back in no hurry
'Cause it's a lonely life
And I can't change overnight
So just turn me on
And turn off the light

And burning in the smoke
I see an old man just the same
Oh, like my father done
All he ever gave me was a name
Stars shattered in his eyes
And they felt to my soul like rain

I'm down at the bottom of my last beer
Just starting to see clear
My eyes feel like stones
I stumble up to the piano
Stumble through a number
And find the last girl's who alone

And if she says that she'll love me
I'll say alright
I live right above here
And I'll carry her up into my arms
Carry her up a couple of flights
And she'll turn me on
And I'll turn off the light
Turn me on, and turn off the light
