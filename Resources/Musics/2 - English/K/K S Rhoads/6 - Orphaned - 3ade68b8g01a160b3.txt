ORPHANED

I float in a basket of coyote alone
Get born into a union but you die on your own
A bear on the iceberg is burning in the sun
What if I go behind the curtain and see no one?

Are we orphaned?
Are we orphaned?
Got lost on a planet
We don't understand
What started in the water is stranded on the sand
They live in the shadows
And they lie about the sun
I satellite the black hole between the brilliant and babylon

Are we orphaned?
Are we orphaned?
We're all the same side
Thrown into the fight
The voices in the back row
Don't know what we don't know
We yell into the night
Are we orphaned?
Are we orphaned?
