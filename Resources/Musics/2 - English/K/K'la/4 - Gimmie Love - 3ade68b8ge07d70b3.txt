GIMMIE LOVE

If I ain't the baddest bitch rappin', then nigga find another
I got other mothafuckers doin' covers on my covers
I got niggas cryin' and dyin' to lye inside my covers
They watchin' mothafuckas whether we be friends or lovers
No other woman you know
can make you hate em' and still want em'
Keep niggas runnin' to me like a public pool in summer
Bitches got so much to say but I wonder why they stutter
'Cause every word I tell them smoothly slowly meltin' butter
I hear the rumors they utter and I pay it no mind
Niggas livin' in the gutter so I stay with no shine
What the fuck I look like stuntin' while my niggas still grind
'Cause a bitch went from nothin' to somethin' in no time
No grind, no hustle, no work, no nothin'
I keep saying that I'm blessed, they keep tellin' me I'm lucky
All these bitches wanna kill me
all they niggas want to fuck me
But all I ever wanted was for somebody to love me

Give me all that you can give me
and then give me some mo'
Give me quarters of your Kush, give me bottles of the Mo
Give me quality to push, give me somethin' I can grow
How I'm supposed to reach the top, if I'm startin' from below
Yeah I used to play the fool but I'm startin' to know
I gotta a lot of hate around me and it's startin' to show
Bitches been turnin' salty since I started to blow
But it's probably just 'cause I'm the only star that they know
Sometimes it's hard to let go of the part that you know
But I'm the type to keep on going like it's part of the show
And when I'mm in the building they be guardin' the door
When I'mm in the spot, it's a party you know
That's why I'm part of the show
and this is only the first season
And the cheatem? Niggas greasy
trust the fires you can see em'
Some people last forever, others for a season
And even when they don't show love
I don't turn my back and leave em'

Look, I ain't askin' for much man
Just askin' that, if you feel me
when you hear me, when you see me
