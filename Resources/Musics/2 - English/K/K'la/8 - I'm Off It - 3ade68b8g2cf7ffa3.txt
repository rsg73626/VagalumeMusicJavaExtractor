I'M OFF IT

It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby

Simmer down, simmer down now,
Let's take some time to finish dinner for you wild out
You've been flashing and sarcasm for a while now
I tried to ignore it in a moment I'm going wild out
But not now, cause I ain't in the mood for attitudes
I can multitask my ass out but I cant manage you
You all see and now I see there ain't no catching you
So I don't taste you, I replace you and imagine you
But I ain't mad at you, this the way you always been
I used to beat around the bush but now I'm going in
You got a problem keep the peace but I ain't no within
That's when you lay beneath my trees and get to know my wind
You knew me then but now you always got a problem though
If I'm too much to handle maybe you should let it go
You holding on to that girls like it's gonna take you home
And I hope they do cause if not be going home alone
Just thought I'd make it known

It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby
It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby

Damn you get loud when you mad, huh
I mean what difference do we make where I got this bagfrom
If you ain't buying tell me what you asking questions for?
Since I'm no liar I will show you really wanna know
Cause I can tell you but be careful cause the truth hurts
And if you trying catch a broken heart the truth works
Now you breaking shit that cost more than you worth
Boy if it's something that you wanna say then use words
Cause what you think you heard ain't really what I said
And what they told you ain't really what I did
So let me hold you, or you can stay mad
But if that's so then let it go, this conversation's dead

It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby
It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby
I'm off it baby, I'm off it, baby
I'm off it baby, I'm off it, baby
It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby
It's too late to be arguing baby
Please don't make me get started baby
I just wanna be off it, baby, I'm off it, I'm off it, baby.
