WHO I AM

What happened to the way things were?
Used to make you happy now im on your nerves
And every time you look me in my eyes
The only thing you see is lies
And I always think that you're using me
Cuz im not the girl that I used to be
You say you love me but I know you can't
Cuz you don't even know who I am

I used to be the sweetest girl ever
Until I found out being the baddest bitch was better
I used to sit back and let these bithces do whatever
Now I shoot out like a .45 beretta
Bet you aint ever think that this the way I be
But after all these years
Did you think I still be na√Øve?
Real recognize real
And I call it like I see it
And if ya do the same
Then I guess thats why ya calling me

I aint got nothing to tell ya
Cuz I don't wanna be the one to fail ya
Cuz I could no longer relate to having somebody to hate
And having someone else to help you up
And don't let go and leave you stuck out on youre own
Your music gets hot - this world gets cold
Especially when you go around exposing you soul

What happened to the way things were?
Used to make you happy now im on your nerves
And every time you look me in my eyes
The only thing you see is lies
And I always think that you're using me
Cuz im not the girl that I used to be
You say you love me but I know you can't
Cuz you don't even know who I am

And I know that lately ive been distant
But baby I been out here on a mission
And I know I come off as a bitch
But when you got fame - you don't really need forgiveness
In this industry everything is business
But you gotta figure out what kinda business this is
Major labels will pimp you like a cheap hoe
But a rookie in this game is an attraction at a freak show
Everybody wants to see you
But nobody wants to meet you
So you land in every airport with nobody there to greet you
When you watching everybody 
cuz you think they tryna cheat you
Don't trust the ones that love you
Eventho they tryna keep you save
You don't see it their way
Cuz genuine concern turn into hate
When you don't get a call back on the same day
You tell people that ive changed
When the truth is ive been this way

What happened to the way things were?
Used to make you happy now im on your nerves
And every time you look me in my eyes
The only thing you see is lies
And I always think that you're using me
Cuz im not the girl that I used to be
You say you love me but I know you can't
Cuz you don't even know who I am
