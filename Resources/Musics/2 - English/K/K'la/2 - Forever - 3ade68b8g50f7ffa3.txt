FOREVER

For the moment that I've seen your face,
From the day I saw your face,
Right then I knew it be Ok,
Then I knew it be Ok!
I hope that, I hope that this moment, moment
Would last forever, ever, ever!
Made to last forever, baby!
Last forever, ever, ever!
Made to last forever, baby!
Last forever, ever, ever!

Ever, and ever, and ever in a day,
I sit and reminiscent on this and let the music play,
Keep on repeat everything you need,
Cause you can't believe anything you see!
If you don't see nothing, well I guess I'm just?
Guess is not Amy, then why would they envy me?
Why would anyone envy when everyone is in Vip,
Cause everybody sings, everybody raps,
Everybody models, so who is left to clap
When is no one in the back, you still be my audience,
So whenever I have my name I know is you who's calling it,
If I'm an work of art, I know it's you who's drawing it
You who puts my picture in a frame,
You who smiles when they're mentioning my name.
You who stands out dressed up in the rain,
Just waiting to buy tickets just to see me get on stage!

From the day I saw your face,
Right then I knew it be Ok,
Then I knew it be Ok!
I hope that, I hope that this moment, moment
Would last forever, ever, ever!
Made to last forever, baby!
Last forever, ever, ever!
Made to last forever, baby!
Last forever, ever, ever!

He speaks directly to my soul,
Whenever you're rapping is like I'm indirectly told
Everything you're thinking versus everything you know,
That's why bitches try to switch your verses everywhere you go!
Get inside your head, try to make ?em think they comprehend,
No one that can touch you, so they try to do it, under hand.
All up in your face smilin' hard baby you the man,
Really all they had to say was listen, baby, I'm a fan!
He say he is Octobers very own,
Ain't seen him since Octobers cause he is very known.
He don't think I want him, just because his very own,
If he's thinking that, well then he's thinking very wrong.
My feelings very strong, but I fight them back,
If he bite like that,I might bite him back,
If I drive him mad, that's why I drive him back.
I don't think I ever heard a verse I like like that,
So don't let it in!
Baby, baby, just don't let it in!

For the moment that I've seen your face,
From the day I saw your face,
Right then I knew it be Ok,
Then I knew it be Ok!
I hope that, I hope that this moment, moment
Would last forever, ever, ever!
Made to last forever, baby!
Last forever, ever, ever!
Made to last forever, baby!
Last forever, ever, ever!
