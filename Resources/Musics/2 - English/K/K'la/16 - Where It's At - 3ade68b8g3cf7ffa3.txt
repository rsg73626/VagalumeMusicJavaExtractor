WHERE IT'S AT

Sometimes I feel like I'm in this thing by myself
Cause I can't even turn around and ask you for your help
Without you trying to say that I'm just digging on your wealth
Boy if that was the case I would've been had better nails
Cause all this cooking and cleaning
You got me washing machine-ing
And I ain't never been the type of bitch to be on this scene
I'm used to diamonds and rings, I'm used to drowning in drinks
I'm used to beauty shops, crooked cops, and fraudulent things

Boy I was harboring dreams, I was plotting and scheming
I was bout to make a way for us to all live our dreams
I'm talking mountains and skis, I'm talking all of them thing
But you too busy trying to keep up out in them streets
While I'm steady to trying to pull you out of them streets
Boy you turn around debating and you battle with me
Boy I'm just trying to tell you who them tattlers be

And who them tattlers be, and who them tattlers be
I'm trying to act like its me, I'm trying to act like a team
I'm trying to be the ride or die bitch you asked me to be
Boy are you joking with me, nigga you broke as can be
Unless you doing magic, boy you hocus pocus-ing me
Cause you ain't you fucking with me, I'm the one that you need
I'm the bread making, dinner baking, raiser of seeds,
Who does it greater than me
There ain't no hater in me, and the more 

I think about it boy its plainer to see
Boy you ain't sheltering me, nah you ain't bettering me
You just bring your doubt and balance out and level with me
You just failing with me, you just weathering me
I swear to god sometimes I fell I got the devil with me
I think it's easy to see that you're just not what I need
I think it's time for us to part and for me to take the lead
I think this whole operation would run better with me
Cause if I say tomorrow nigga then that's when it will be like

Baby we can't live on dreams
And right now we don't have anything
You said you'd have it yesterday
But yesterday is gone away
Where it's at baby?
Where it's at baby?
Where it's at baby?
Where it's at baby?

Together forever, that's what I always told you
But I ain't know that I would have to make and mold you
I guess nobody ever told you
You gotta have money to make it through
And as I hold you and console you
I know other powers control you
Cause that jewelry that sold you
Ain't worth the money that they told you

Baby we can't live on dreams
And right now we don't have anything
You said you'd have it yesterday
But yesterday is gone away
Where it's at baby?
Where it's at baby?
Where it's at baby?
Where it's at baby?
