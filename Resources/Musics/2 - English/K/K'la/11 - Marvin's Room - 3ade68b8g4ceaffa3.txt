MARVIN'S ROOM

Turned over just to see your face, 
found somebody laying where you lay,
I can't recall what I did yesterday, but I woke up in a mess today.
I know I don't have to explain, but I wanna tell you anyway,
That he ain't you, no, he ain't you and I promised you, 
I'd wait for you.

Why did I fuck this nigga that's inside my bed?
I'd give anything to have you here instead.
I said fuck this nigga that's inside my bed,
And if you with somebody, fuck that bitch instead.
She ain't me, no, she ain't me.
You know it [x4]

Look, I know it hurts, I know the feeling,
So, when I say I'm sorry, you know I mean it.
You only heard about it, I really seen it,
And I did my best to never let him come in between us.
You'd be heartbroken if you seen us, so just be glad you didn't
And you think that I wanted to give my love to a different man?
Hand in hand, said you'd be there to the end
But the day you walked away from me, you held a different hand.
And I still save my goods for your exports,
But you still got former relations with all of your ex whores.
So, yeah, I did it, I ain't got nothing to flex for,
But why you tripping, when you know you slipping sex more?
Yeah, I know, two wrongs don't make it right,
I mean, I make mistakes but hey, they make my night,
And you can't make me cheat, no, you can't make me lie,
But if I say I want it, you better make the time.

Before I fuck this nigga that's inside my bed,
I'd give anything to have you here instead.
I said fuck this nigga that's inside my bed,
And if you with somebody, fuck that bitch instead.
Cause she ain't me, no, she ain't me,
And you promised me, you'd wait for me,
And you know it, you know it [x4]

That's why I'd fuck this nigga that's inside my bed,
I'd give anything to have you here instead.
I said fuck this nigga that's inside my bed,
And if you with somebody, fuck that bitch instead.
Yeah, you can fuck that bitch instead.
