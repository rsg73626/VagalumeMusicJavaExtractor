I DON'T BELIEVE YOU

Nope, nope, naw, I don't believe you 'cause
You make the story better whenever you need to, cuz
Tryna do it big to make sure that we see you, cuz
I mean I can do it better, ion need to, cuz
What you bout, what you on?
My guess is nothing

Runnin' that bullshit out yo mouth
nigga you sick or something?
You claim you back up what you saying
but you steady frontin'
Get that light-weight action outta here, we heavy stunnin'
My music steady bumpin'
Haters just keep on comin'
Behind a man who think
making millions'll make me want him

You stackin' paper that you pulled out of your trust fund
While you stack paper, we stack haters where I come from
Got 99 but I'm tryna make a hundun
Now you niggas understand why I'm on one
On one, on two, on three, go!
Beat me to the top
I'll even sing slow

Niggas talk a good game
But they just talkin' it
Yeah they rockin' big chains
Oh but they borrowed it
You swear you the realest thang
But you're just hollywood
'Cause niggas talk a good game
But I don't believe you
No I don't you
But I don't believe you
No I don't believe you

And I never will
So I could never care about the way the nigga feel
My conversation sick, my attitude is ill
And I get heated quick
That's why he always tell me "chill, chill, chill, chill, chill"
Relax
Listen to the facts
I tell him, fuck that, boy, listen to my tracks
If you tryna get to know me, that's exactly where it's at

And anything else is a mothafuckin act
Don't mothafuckin act like you don't know
I mothafuckin crack that whip at home
And I ain't tryna play you like you don't hit strong
Just face it, it's a fact
Even yo bitch strong
We the best, we the mothafuckin best, baby
Even out east, we the mothafuckin west, baby
Strong hard head on the black and red chest, baby
Fuck with the bull you get the horns
You could've guessed, baby

Niggas talk a good game
But they just talkin' it
Yeah they rockin' big chains
Oh but they borrowed it
You swear you the realest thang
But you're just hollywood
'Cause niggas talk a good game
But I don't believe you
No I don't you
But I don't believe you
No I don't believe you
