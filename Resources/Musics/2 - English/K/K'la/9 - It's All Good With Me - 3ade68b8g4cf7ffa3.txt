IT'S ALL GOOD WITH ME

It's all good with me (yeah) [x4]

It's the weekend and I'm feeling good
Hop in his chevy fuck the levy we gon' hit the hood
And if he rollin' let me hold it let me hit the wood
I'm talking backwards cuz they pass like you know they should
Cuz we smoke hella weed 
and we drink hella liquor these niggas sweatin'
Me so we take hella pictures
Cuz I look hella good can't find a bitch that's sicker
And if you think you could
Then how the fuck you figure that?
Can't even picture that
No poloroid
Not even stevie wonder can make a nigga feel over joy
Cuz he on overload
Got him like oh my lord
Soon as a came
Turn on the game
Like nigga what's the score?

I'm down for getting drunk
I'm down for getting high
I'm down for finding love
I'm down with getting mine
I'm down to hit the hood
I'm down for riding high
I'm down for looking good
I'm down for getting fye

It's all good with me (yeah) [x4]

It's all good over this way
Just stepped out looking like a fuckin display
Let my fuckin disk play
Put my shit on replay
Cuz I don't give a fuck what he or she say
We play these games all night all day
Usher in this muthafucka we gon' do it my way
Or you can hit the highway
Better yet the freeway
I cut these niggas no slack cuz I get all the lead way
She get all the weak lames that I turn down
While I be with the bosses that she heard bout
All up on they side like
Too tight button downs
But if my niggas wanna ride
Then they always know I'm down like..

I'm down for getting drunk
I'm down for getting high
I'm down for finding love
I'm down with getting mine
I'm down to hit the hood
I'm down for riding high
I'm down for looking good
I'm down for getting fye

It's all good with me (yeah) [x4]
