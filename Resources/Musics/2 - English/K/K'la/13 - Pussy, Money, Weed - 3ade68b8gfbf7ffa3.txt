He say he love me like
He say he love me like
Yes I love her like
He say he love me like
He say he love me like
Yes I love her like
But he don't ever love you right
Yes I love her like

They tell me sex sells
But I ain't buying it
Cause hoes learn to hard way
That it's free when you just trying it
But a bed always feels so much better
With a guy in it
So they figure celebrities will probably keep it ?
But they the lyingest tell you what you wanna hear
No baby it's cool no one's ever gonna know you are here
So you listen to them
Ducking doubts and fighting off your fears
Every time you get around his boys
They are looking weird
Whispering in your ear like
I heard about you girl
Don't take it wrong but I heard you [?] cool girl
I heard you are down if I wanna try two girls
You ain't gotta worry about my man
He got a new girl
Uh girl now you are feeling embarrassed
You got a bad reputation that nigga was careless
But this new nigga said he could take you to paris
And since you fuckin why not fuck em 
might as well get your share in

Every girls spends her life looking for a prince charming
But if he takes too long she will settle for the door man
She don't really care just as long as he ain't poor man
But if he is fuck it
Then she will settle for your man
But don't call her a home wrecker
Never had a home so she don't really know better
All she had was hope so she turned into a go getta
Ran away from home but she ain't have no one to go get
She convinced her friends to go and get up
On that pole with her
Tipping where she stripping 
so she is going home with your figures
Go figure now she is feeling like she owned
And she swear this life is like the best she ever known
Except the fact that niggas hitting then
They send her home
Guess somebody should told her all
That glitters isn't gold
So don't trade it for the soul
And don't forget your coat
Cause this world can be cold
So I just hope you know

Shorty used to be the type with a head on her shoulders
A dream of rovers casanovas kept on pushing her forward
Over and over had to put a nigga back in his place
Out of her face and on to the next hoe that he chase
She stayed on top of things never blinded by the bling
Or the rings or anything that the nigga had on the scene
She was convinced no prince will sweep her off her feet
And it was obvious that she'd have to get her own shit
On her own tip so she went and copped her own whip
But unlike the average caddy she copped her a big body
Just to let these niggas know 
they ain't have to show her shit
She hopped outta the whip
Cracked a smile and showed [?] grill
White gold matching the chrome 
that was holding up her wheels
But still felt incomplete so she copped her some green
So now she is pushing the green
Therefore she is kushing the green
Cause you can't lose when you know t
hat you got kush on the team
