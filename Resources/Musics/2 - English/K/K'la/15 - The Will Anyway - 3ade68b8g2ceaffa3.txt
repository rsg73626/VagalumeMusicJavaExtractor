THE WILL ANYWAY

Uncontrollable forces we living under
Hot as hell winter's hell frozen over summer
We can tell you what the temp be but can't control the number
Cause our educated guesses are the same thing as a ponder
Point and laugh at the niggas driving honda's
Speed past them in the benz's they can't ride beside us
Chasin after cash are probably right behind us
Ain't thinkin' bout the money then 
you probably shouldn't mind us
Know who you flying with, smoke the finest
King kush roll royally your highness
Don't wanna fuck with us cause we be on that grind shit
Looking for trouble well I swear you're about to find it
So just rewind it, gone and back it up
You really tripping and I don't think that you packed enough
You should have read the script before you started acting up
I give you what you need and guarantee 
you it ain't what you want

You keep saying what it is you say
But all I hear what you want
Well let me tell you what it is I see
No one gets the shit they want
No one wants to lose the game
No one wants to feel ashamed
No one wants to die today
But they will anyway

You can't escape the inevitable
So your best option is just living it and letting it go
They say they take your life but really they just sweatin' your soul
Ain't never killed before, 
so most of them just say it for show half-way murderers, 
you fucking kill me
Cut me up frankenstein me but I'm still me
So I don't worry about the backstabbing hippies
Stab me in the back but I bet you that I still breathe
I got that kill freeze, immortal flow
While all these ten buck rappers give you quarter rolls.
Fuck the song up then tell you to enjoy the show
When they don't deserve it I still give the people
What they want, make that what they need, 
cause this is necessary
If hip hop was dead it's time for it to be in burried
I'm here to take the titles all these half-way rappers carry
If they fear the future then I know the thought of me is scary

You keep what it is you say
But all I hear is what you want
Well let me tell you what it is I see
No one gets the shit they want
No one wants to lose the game
No one wants to feel ashamed
No one wants to die today
But they will anyways
But they will anyway, hey
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

Ya tryna tell me what you think that you need
But ain't your mama ever tell you life is more than you see
That's you I keep on giving more than want you want and for me
Cause what you need and what you got or what you want it to be
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
