JUST A GIRL

I'm just a girl
Already broken
Trapped in a world
Ran by emotions
Constantly searchin' to heal whatever is hurtin'
'Til I come 'cross a man who can make me feel like a girl

'Cause I swear I'm tired of being grown
It takes a lot of work to lift the world up on your own
I wasn't made to be the man, but I can play the role
Until I find a nigga strong enough to take control
So let's take a stroll
Tell me what you know
Can you take the wheel and get us there if I let go?
'Cause I can fry it if you try to bring the bacon home
And I won't even take a cut of whatever you make alone
Ion need you, ion need you, man I swear I don't
Youn need me, youn need me, but I'm what you want
I always say it's not fair when you don't come home
'Cause I still get scared when I sleep alone

I'm just a girl
Already broken
Trapped in a world
Ran by emotions
Constantly searchin' to heal whatever is hurtin'
'Til I come 'cross a man who can make me feel like a girl

Young girl, young girl, this world is yours
But just avoid all the handouts and open doors
Don't fuck around and put your hand out
and loose your voice
'Cause once you choose the wrong way
you don't have a choice
Stuck in the cycle of getting used and being recycled

You know a couple gold diggers, but they nothing like you
You use to date them old niggas, but they don't excite you
But anything you say
you want you know them niggas buy you
You let them niggas try you
You let them niggas play you
You let them niggas tear your temple up and desecrate you
The only thing you didn't do was make them niggas pay you
And now you run from man to man praying one will take you

I'm just a girl
Already broken
Trapped in a world
Ran by emotions
Constantly searchin' to heal whatever is hurtin'
'Til I come 'cross a man who can make me feel like a girl
