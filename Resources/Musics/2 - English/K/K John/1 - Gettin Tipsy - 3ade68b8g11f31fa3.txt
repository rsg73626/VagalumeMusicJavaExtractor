GETTIN TIPSY

[Intro]
Teen drinkin is very bad
Yo I got a fake Id tho'
(Beat starts)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Two step nigga, two step nigga

[Verse One]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Errybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass just look like she want more
Like she a groupie, and I ani't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I rock out the stores
Bottom of the ninth, and this nigga gotta score
If not I got to move on to the next floor
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin he dont know I got a gun
When it come to poppin we do this for fun
You ain't got one nigga you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin head from a hun
While she goin down I'm braggin on what I done
She smokin my stuff sayin she ain't havin fun
She ain't give it back now you don't get none

[Hook x4: Whispering]
Now errybody in da club gettin tipsy
(Errybody in the club gettin tipsy)
[x4]

[Verse Two]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass now I'm lookin' at her thighs
Now she tellin me how much she had a guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes high
Oh you twenty one girl thats alright
I wonder if her shake comin with them fries
If so baby can I get 'em super size?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feeling on my chest and right out the blue
And she super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of one life I'mma need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewls
Scratchin on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
The average manditory I ain't gotta sound rich
This single man ain't tryin to get hitched
Nickel wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it off now I'm back to gettin lit
Get some orange juice man this some good shit
Homeboy trippin 'cause I'm sturing at his chick
Now he on the sideline sturing at my click
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the arr if yo cats drunk as me
Club on the set Quan cut out them trees
Dude I don't curr I'm a P.I.M.P!

[Hook]

[Outro x4: Whispering]
(Errybody in da club gettin tipsy)
[Beat continues til fade]
