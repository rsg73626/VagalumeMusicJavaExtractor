HIGHER

we might want to take you higher than.. 
you might want to take it higher take it 
we just want to take it higher than.. 
you might want to take it higher... take it 
we just want to take you higher than.. 
you might want to take it higher take it 

(K-OS) 
Love do we really know the meaning, cause we always fuss and fight 
and the mind is so deceiving, when the heart cant stead you right 
So I wrote this song to tell you, that I cant stand alone in the fire 
forget the lies they sell you, Only you can take me high 

Love without a second... Far to close to mention 
Love without a second... Far to close to mention 

(K-OS) 
You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above 
You can take this higher.... than I can 
You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above 
You can take this higher.... than I can 

(K-OS) 
Theres no need keeping it seperated. 
Just show me we moving together now 
Ain't no need keeping it seperated. 
Just show me we moving together 

(K-OS) 
yo yo 
You really got me going, you took me for a ride 
Funny how you got two faces, Dr. Jeckle, Mr. Hyde 
I try to swallow my pride but then I choke 
people thinking this is just a joke 
Never really got the verses I wrote 
Its just a rap song thats all, people do not care 
Do it for money and power and rolleys in the air 
But you know who be returning so people dont fear 
I got to take it high and disappear 
I got to do it 

You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above 
You can take this higher.... than I can 
You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above 
You can take this higher.... than I can 

Theres no need keeping it seperated 
Just show me we moving together now 
Ain't no need keeping it seperated 
Just show me we moving together 

You say you say you say you flying 
and it feel so good 
(repeated to the end of the song)
