BLACK ICE (HYMN 4 DISCO)0

Sometimes the way we look at life can be too serious 
Cuz were dancin by the pale moon light 
I wake up in the morning and I get delerious 
Cuz of something that I did last night 
But then the neighbor came on to me 
She said that life is more than we see 
You've got to be the change that should be 
So dont die, just try.... 
Were just some fool with the light song 
Open your gun in two 
And turn in up the moon 
I play it cool till the night is over 
When are you comin back 
To save this heart of mine 
Time to take it slow 
Black ice, white snow 
What if the truth is we dont really know 
If so then life is a mystery 
this could be then end of all history 
but wait the sun rises in the east 
And the world still spins 360 degrees on its axis 
This isnt the galactic practice 
of rhymin, cruises no beginning of ending of timing 
reminds like the sun to take your back off the wall 
People in the party in the light game show 
once again be dummin down the e's off the globe 
once a definition of this thing called black 
I had a preminition 18 way back 
That black is the color of the universe from whence we came 
I wonder if my soul is on ice again 
Who put the light song open your gun in two 
And turn in up the moon 
I play it cool till the night is over 
When are you comin back 
to save this heart of mine
