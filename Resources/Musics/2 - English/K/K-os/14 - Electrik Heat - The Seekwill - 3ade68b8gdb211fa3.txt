ELECTRIK HEAT - THE SEEKWILL

[Intro:] 
Ok, its about to go down 
Please step up 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go 

[Verse 1:] 
Its the return, burn like a supernova 
Spit the plates, the great debates over 
Dont rush, take it easy, slow down 
Earth is a space ship spinning round and round 
Were in it, together, we can make it better 
Don't sweat a, thing swing with no vendetta 
I rhyme in a graph style, carve every letter 
To move every B-boy king like Coretta 
Scott, keep it hot block once rock 
The plot that we tried to recignise was not 
The L to the O-V, M-O-V-E 
K dub dropin' the dub, thats new TV 
The E-M-C double E no doubt 
Runin' the route, wakin' out, turnin' the part out 
We all fall from grace and make mistakes 
And race the pace the base with the anidote "base" 
And every single word in the verb wildstyle 
Its not a mission its a riddle lifestyle 
I'm still in the struggle and I see the light guile 
Turnin' pretend accend whats in the profile 

[Chorus:] 
Can you feel it, to the beat ya'll 
Let the music play for the people 
And if got a rock, whether your ready or not 
yo, guess whos back with the sequell 
Oh ya, just do it 
Oh ya, just do it 

[Verse 2:] 
Now, in the beginning the light shined so bright 
Within the city of my mind-scaped night 
Listening, glistening the moon refliceting the sun 
making me one with the music 
Oh, get low, get for, get ho 
Its different black gold 
Yes I'm in the house but I never ever sold 
Rhyme like vynl, 20 years old 
With the mic in my hand, ringin' alarm 
Singin' the song, bringing the calm to dramas so hard 
To much info, been so instrumental, prtential, exponential 
My DJ's cuts are presidential 
Yo Jazz, let the rythm hit 'em 
I woke up to make the main cut, to face the pain 
What does space contain love? 
Its the heat-seaker, packin' the speaker to beat the sleek creature 
It was written the sequel 

[Chorus] 

[Outro:] 
Now 
The world is yours unless the world is ours 
What casting stones from afar 
We're like people driving in our cars 
On los highway, my way
