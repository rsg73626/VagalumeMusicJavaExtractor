I WISH I KNEW NATALIE PORTMAN (I CAN'T REALLY MAKE YOU LOVE ME)

I'm on the run for my life
It seems that everything that you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you ever thought you've done your best
When you were under the gun, that's right
I know I've seen this place before, 
But it's never been so fun
It's never been so fun
(Check it out, here we go)

(Chorus)
I've been on a run
This shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me, no, no
You know I can't really make you love me 
I've been on a run
My shadow weighs a ton
I know I found a recipe, for me
But I can't really make you love me, no, no,
You know I can't really make you love me

You know I'm haunted on overseas,
Haunted on each coast,
Play them like Ebaneeza
I made them see the ghost
Back from the future,
Dawned in Japanese kimonos, 
Even thought the streets show love to try to see me go, 
I often see me floating, 
But my shadow it weighs a ton, 
Call it baggage,
I use it all to advantage
I can't make you love me, 
This time it's on you,
And you can't try to deny,
These words when they're true,
I'm on the run

(Chorus)

(oh no, aye oh)

Let's get a steppin, 
Your tongue is like a weapon,
This is cappin from heaven and yet
So are y'es, since the age of seventeen,
I've been taking apart microphones,
You've been taking apart men you've blown
Whit glowing skeleton bones in the closet, 
Animals strike curious poses,
They feel the heat between us (2x)
But you need a woman's glorious diamonds and fetus
Carry my penis, 
I'm like the man in the moon, 
When we kiss the you soon on the run

(Chorus)
I can't really make you love me 2x
