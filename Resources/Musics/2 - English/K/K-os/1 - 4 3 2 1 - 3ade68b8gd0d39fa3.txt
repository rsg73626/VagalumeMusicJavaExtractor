Verse 1: 
You say hello I say goodbye 
don't leave me high off clothes to dry 
feels so good when your bye my side 
check my done depth playin' my role like were fly yea whatever 
I thought together would toughen the leather 
and never pull put the pleasure under pressure 
but it seems all that glitters is gold 
baby you sold your soul for the golden goose 
but the truth is aslong as i keep ryhming 
eyes keep shining soul stays divine 
I remember '96 we used to dance 
i had two pairs of pants but you had that glance 
yo we used to hang out in the park and juct chill 
now we swing swords in the dark and act ill 
doesn't really matter i got to go 
peace the maistros that rock fo sho we did it 

Chorus: 
4 3 2 1 what were fighting for 3 2 1 
I don't know what for 3 2 1 
what were fighting for 3 2 1 
i don't know what for, for, for, 

Verse 2: 
Guess whos back but never left it all 
with a brand new pencil and a crystal ball 
let it fall 
sometime break down the wall 
you can't give what you have to recieve it all 
its the truth 
full proof 
but fools need proof 
so I slide to the side and I act uncool 
But its just an act 
cause i might react 
to those who never held a mic that fed back 
listen its just a day in the life 
of a man living in the dark on headlights 
wake up to dealin 
village raised the villan 
I wirte raps well I watch myself on the ceiling 
4321 its a countdown 
I roll like a laser through the downtown 
mind over matter you tame the glow 
piece the metric LJ (era) oooh.. 

Chorus: 
4 3 2 1 what were fighting for 3 2 1 
I don't know what for 3 2 1 
what were fighting for 3 2 1 
i don't know what for, for, for, 
what fooor.. 
what for what for what for 
what fooor.. 
what fooor.. 

Hook: 
Clap your hands everybody 
don't act like you never saw that 
just clap your hands everybody 
and everybody clap your hands 
Clap your hands everybody 
don't act like you never saw that 
just clap your hands everybody 
and everybody clap your hands
