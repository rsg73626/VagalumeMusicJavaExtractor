HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS

Turn this up (x2)
Yo uh-huh
Yes no no no beat yeah no no no beat
Bring it (x2)
(Chorus)
Heaven only knows, cause I don't understand (understand now)
Won't you tell me please (tell me) what's the master plan (master plan)
Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (only God knows), so I'll just move the crowd
Now I break out of my physical shell and exhale past this so called body
Used to go to the party, but now I sit and chill with a pen and a pad
Dropping ill philosophical science me and my dad, we talk about life and how it started
How we departed from life's path and probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that were not who we think we are
But in this land of the lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be gettin high, wondering why we die
But it's all planned, forget your fear take the hand
We keep on returning cause the lessons need learning
Concerning (what) fact I sing and I rap, I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analyze, I energize, cosmic rays of days the igno
Then get my signal for the sun
(Chorus)
Heaven only knows, cause I don't understand (don't understand)
Won't you tell me please (cause I pray everyday) what's the master plan (the master plan)
Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (only God knows), so I'll just move the crowd
So uh riddle me this, riddle me this like this
Melodical prodigal flows, hypnotical blows to brain pieces (ooh)
Telekinesis (ahh) when I reach this pinnacle, cynical, clinical
Microphone autobots, waiting on lotto spots, trying to rock
But yo they can't understand, there's only one plan
The time is at hand, in the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to save the righteous children
Now, I know you wanna be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl
Watching your jacuzzi swirl (uh), seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust (me)
It's kinda hard you rhyme sometimes everybody wants to scrutinize
Redefine who you are, but every person is a star
So let your light shine far, and praise god
(Chorus)
Heaven only knows (only knows now), cause I don't understand (don't understand now)
Won't you tell me please (tell me please) what's the master plan (I wanna know the plan)
Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (yo if you feel this sing it wit me now), so I'll just move the crowd
La la la la la la la la la la I'll just move the crowd for now (gotta move the crowd (x3)
La la la la la la la la la la (la la) I'll just move the crowd for now
Somebody told me they said uh
If you free them (uh huh) they will start revolution and Babylon can not defeat them
(right yo)
And they don't want that (x3)
If you free them (free them) they will start revolution (uh huh)
and Babylon can not defeat them (mind revolution (x2))
And so uh huh huh, my sister (??)
My girl (??) (do you know the time)
The shadows forehand and thats love baby
(And I gel)?? and uh the Figure Four uh huh
The Rascalz and uh Kardinal and uh
My Mom and Dad uh huh
My brother A and uh my brother J and uh
The whole world uh huh

You get love uh huh
