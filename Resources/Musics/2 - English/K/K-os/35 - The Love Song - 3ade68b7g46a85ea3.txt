THE LOVE SONG

Contrary to popular belief, know what yo
This is not a lovesong
It's a sonnett
Damn if feels good to have people up on it but
I'm just a fool playing with the masters tools
Learning how to break the rules of this record company
coup
Hallucination - I see with my eyes
But my heart's telling me lies
Why do I fantisize?
Why am I telling lies to the people from the stage
Pretending it's all good when inside it's fire and
rage
Cuz I can't understand how a man lives off the life of
another man
Tryin to pimp the universe - that's a joke
I stay rockin the boat down on my last note
It's murder she wrote
Assassination vocabulary
I see your termination is heavily necessary
I should known - they do it for Forbes alone
I do it to break the walls if I fell off then let me
know people
 
It's funny how life can go
First you ride high then you might lay low
Don't get high off your own supply
Someone said first before a four comes five
This is my message to the world
Just tryin to reach every boy and girl
Not tryin to say if it's right or wrong
This is not a love song

Lyrical optometrists with 20/20 vision
Are serving rounds like my granny used to serve
provisions
Chaotical amneotical fluid
The rap druid is fluent in the art of onomatopoeia
Metaphysical microscopic topic dropper
When I was a kid I wanted rollerskates and a bike
chopper
But alas, pop, pop never thought to keep me in style
Thats why I'm schizophrenic now
So God bless the child that has his own
The harvest we reap is what we sow
Chrome microphone - shoot it
Towards a dome of computer digital clones that mimic
philosopher stones
Sayin a style's their own when they bite like Mike
Furounsville
The sounds ill
Relationship is a mirror
That you see yourself up in and the picture is
clearer
Thats why I'm on the scene with a mike like Ernesto
Guevara
Why I may exploit with lights like Geraldo Rivera,
they just.

It's funny how life can go
First you ride high then you might lay low
Don't get high off your own supply
Someone said first before a four comes five
This is my message to the world
Just tryin to reach every boy and girl
Not tryin to say if it's right or wrong
This is not a love song

It's easy not to care what people say
It's harder to pretend and try
Cuz they can only love you from yesterday
I'm looking at them now they pose high
I'm just a man who's walking
They stand around and keep talking
They tried to clip my wings
But wisdom fills so many things
Say it again
I'm just a man who's walking
They stand around and keep talking
They tried to clip my wings
But wisdom fills so many things

It's funny how life can go
Dont get high off your own supply
This is my message to the world...

Not tryin to say if it's right or wrong
This is not a love song
