THE ANTHEM

Don't ask me why when they're coming from the sky, just let it go, there's some things you'll never know x3

This right here...this will last forever. plausible of god...this is a beat down
So all my peoples, if you've had enough. you wanna bring it back.
sing the anthem...sing it with me

Chorus: I won't fear anymore more, Hip-Hop is back for sure sure
Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for emcees cees
Who sold out so easily ly
But the truth shall set them free free
Have no fear no no fear, oh no

Verse 1:
It's the return of original man from outer space
The human race, is like eyes without a face
I pull ya car, I saw you try to fool God
And now you wanna switch up the game it's rather odd
Damn, I thought that they were down for mine
But alas a good woman is hard to find
So I get up, I'm really fed up with infadelity
This is my penalty for infiltrating with the melody
At times, I look at my face in the mirror
And wonder if the picture is clearer to me than to them
But then again, they sell crack to kids
That's what is, so I just attack the biz
And it's just my sole obligation
To unite this whole Hip-Hop nation
Face it, we're taking over your radio station
Hey sid, this is the time for jubilation

*Chorus*

Verse 2:
Now we can break it down like this
Or we can break it down like that
They stole Hip-Hop, come on let's take it back
To east coast stompon, rompin
Over the rhythm and then I hit 'em with the
Most beautiful jewels that shine through the darkness
Spark this, some are concerned with who's the hardest
Artist, call me the fluid MC
Slippin' through the cracks bring it back definitely
Now, who is the man that's forgotten his name
Living in shame but can't recall the place where he came from
The same one, dancing on your video screen
Hideous dreams, I can't believe we do it from cream, yo
But it's the anthem to turn back the tables, fables
Wack emcees working for labels
I'll see you all in the next life time
It's not Kevin, just a message from serious seven 

*Chorus*

Don't ask me why when they're coming from the sky
Just let it go, there's some things you'll never know X4
Yeah...uh...You wanna rap with me I'm a rap hater
You wanna rap against me I'm a rap terminator
I'm getting mad props like on a movie set
And if the time runs out then ???
Take it to the end and...def with the record, def with the record
A universe without life is lifeless
Easy on the motion not equals locomotion
