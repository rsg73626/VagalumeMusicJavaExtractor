CALL ME

Call me
(call me)
If you wanna go
we don't have to stay
In a world that is slippin' away

Call me
(call me)
If you wanna go
we don't have to stay
In a world that is slippin' away

Face the world
my father told me
that life is mystical
beautiful bliss-ful
Now, in troubled times
I find soul in reaching
what I'm seeking seems so far

My mother told me

it blows my mind
just what we'll be reaping
and weeping so help us god
Never knew that I
could be looking why
are so many
breaking
making castles of sand
every man
wanna be the one
wanna be the one to be
king for a day but its slipping away
and I'm happy
most melodical things I say
to release the pain
and cease the rain
in my brainstorm
I can't hide
from inside
escape to, the outside
and I'll be flying away.

Chorus (repeat 2x)

Never know, never know
whats right until you walking death
everyday is just a struggle
we take till there's nothing left
when I wake up pray that I can see the truth between the dark
for the rest that don't care this a message straight to your heart
nothing you say now can turn me away
I'm walking the path, never-le me a stray
many they hold mics I don't know what to say
whats going on today?
And you walk to fast
on the broken glass
on the smoking pass
hoping that
worshipping the cash
but it never lasts
won't you ask
what can we be?
can we be free?
where can we go?

Chorus (repeat 2x)

Call me
Call me (if you wanna go)
Call me (you
