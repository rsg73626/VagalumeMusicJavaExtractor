DIRTY WATER

CHORUS

I don't know where I'm coming from
Only know where I belong
There's dirty water in my bones
She... I know she will follow me
But she ain't got no sympa...
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got soul but no money
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got soul but no money
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

VERSE

At the age of eighteen,
came on the scene clean,
now I know what pains means.
Spent time in the darkest places,
beautiful faces in the dark oasis.
Trying to take this to the full extent.
Am I real heaven sent?
Clark Kent's my alter ego.
Took that girl down to Puerto Rico.
Now I find out that we're not amigos.
Treated her foul never as an equal
Now I'm all sad just because my ego,
Had a golden key, couldn't find a key hole.
Yo, stop let the beat rock,
conscious hip hop is gettin dropped.
Wake up saw B and the little one,
little son had b-phids done.
Easy come, easy go.
Everyone thinks they know,
'bout the thing, high unknown.
Put their thoughts on a throne,
then they name it G-O-D,
colonize, you and me.
But I'm free, in the sky,
me, myself, and I. Word.

CHORUS

I don't know where I'm coming from
Only know where I belong
There's dirty water in my bones
She... I know that she will follow me
But she ain't got no sympa...
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee

Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

VERSE

I was walkin down the mountainside.
No matter what I did I couldn't hide,
from all the things inside of me.
Seems that I was living fantasy,
singing, oh, how time flies, with crystal clear eyes.
This life I know is gone.
Oh, how time flies, with crystal clear eyes.
This girl I like is gone, and now I leave home.

She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee
