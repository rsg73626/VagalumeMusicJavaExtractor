CRUCIAL

[Intro] 
see this here 
this is Crucial, yea 

[Verse 1] 
This is an emergency 
They shot down in the dark 
They did cause the paid a fee 
Now there's nothing to die for 
All the kids from miles around 
Are fools in paradise 
Don't know about the pirate sound 
So the scene is an eyesore 
Coming back we fly away 
Jaja coming so I live to see another day 
All I think about if I were just to run away 
Would I come back to love you girl? 

[Hook] 
I don't wanna change the world 
I only want to stop pretending 
What you say? Come again 
What you say? Come again now 
Nothing left to do but let it burn 
I only hope we're all ascening high 
What you say? Come again? 
What you say? Come again now? 

[Verse 2] 
All around my hometown 
They tried to chop me down 
But the truth shall not forsake me 
Take me up to higher ground 
And you-ou-ou-ou-ou 
You're the life when the feeling is dark 
Not pretending the game is a race 
Because you're born and you die'll in my heart 

[Hook] 
I don't wanna change the world 
I only want to stop pretending 
What you say? Come again? 
What you say? Come again now? 

I will never let you down 
I'll be right here beside you, hanging around 
So if you think you let me down 
Leave me here in silence, Without a sound 

Change words Ch-Change burns 
We came first 
That's why we're in chains 
and there's nowhere to play at night
