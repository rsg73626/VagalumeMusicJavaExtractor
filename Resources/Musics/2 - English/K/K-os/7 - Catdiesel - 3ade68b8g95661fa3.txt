Hey
Recognize
I got a new name; get up on this x8
I got a…

I was sad x3
Until I heard her guitar
Shinning like the stars
From outside an opera bar
On the east side
The way she played it made me feel like I was back home
Her eyes are like two suns shinning down on this desert I roam
Tell him… x2
That is why I…
I can’t take this feeling in my heart anymore
Hey…x 7
Time for me to step and make my way through the door
If by chance I see you on this road once again
I can guarantee you that I will not pretend 

Ok, so what’s new is it really the old pursued
I meet the home girl on the corner of Broadview
And Queen, and she was that, power to hypnotize
Strumming on the guitar and telling me no lies
Behind the dark skin, was a soul of Isis
Priceless, Aquarius Pisces I was a fish
And she was the water, heavenly daughter
With southern twang claiming to be from Georgia
But I couldn’t believe she had to be from galaxies
Far beyond and Kevin was so fond
Of the shape of her hands
I studied the lines in her face
Wondering if she knew what’s the secret of human race is
Face it
I drop the Megatron Bomb
Thanks to Terry and Jackie I just stay calm
I got my heart broke one shot gun…Blow
But that’s ok; I got a new name now

I got a new name; get up on this x8

Yo!
Dance to the x8

I can’t take this feeling in my heart anymore
Time for me to step and make my way through the door
If by chance I see you on this road once again
I can guaranty you that I will not pretend 

Better recognize C.A.N.A.D.A...eh...eh...what we say

Shame on a… that tries to run game on a…

Ha ha ha…
