HALLELUJAH

Verse 1: 

I walked down this city streets 
Just a lonely man inspired 
Hoping God would send the water down 
To quench this burning fire 
If I left here for the mountain 
A monestary man 
Things are still the same so I remain 
To show just who I am 
Seen things around me 
Bonny & Clyde 
Graffiti with no message 
Doctors medicine and pride 
But it doesn't really matter 
They're blowin' in the wind 
On the cover of a magazine 

Chorus: Hallelujah 

Babylon is falling 
Babylon is falling 
Hallelujah 
Babylon is falling 
Babylon is falling 

Verse 2: 

I try wash my dirty hands 
But they won't come off with water 
Hoping truth will make me clean and then 
Redeem my sons and daughters 
Though they're not ? we're very happy 
Vast along the nose 
That's why I left my memories far behind on nature's road 
Seems so simple, the future's the past 
The present are the things we holdin' on to make those last 
But it doesn't really matter 

*Chorus* 

Hallelujah x4
