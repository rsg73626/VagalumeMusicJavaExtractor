DESIRE

The will to find you it remains in my heart, 
the souvenir of its look it illuminates my darkness I know that it does not advance I to try to run away and to deceive me.
Therefore my suvenirs never will go to erase themselves, I do not know to deal with this feeling that it is appearing.
Perhaps he would be better I never more to see you and to hide what I´m feeling,
I dissimulate not to suffer with this and I follow faces, my heart is trying to dominate my mind, 
I don´t know if I´m ready to risk, I don´t know if I must leave for to try to find you.
Perhaps for you I faced this fear, but my silence never will say this desire to you.
