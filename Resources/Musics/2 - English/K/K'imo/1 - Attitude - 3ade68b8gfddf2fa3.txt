ATTITUDE

Prison in my life, my revolt and my pain, illusion every night sadness in my face,
The solitude it´s my friend I cry every day, this drug of life is destroying my head!

I want an exit and I want to try again, I see other world ahead in my eyes,
I don´t have fear and don´t have nothing, I see misery of mirror I hear words mercy.

Fuck my life…Fuck my life.

I´m going blind I´m going for way death, I do of the world my suicide note,
Revolt in my hate history repeats itself, tears and dark days closed in my mind.

Always I think in to speak always I´m in silence, nothing change in my life desperation of cry,
The world died in my thought pain constant in my face, my life´s disturbed
Solitude in my eyes.
