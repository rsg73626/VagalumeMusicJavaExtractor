NEW LIFE

When it´s new everything and we not know what to do,
When the fear of fail is present and to feel life running in ours vains,
Sometimes we think in desist itself before of try…before of try.

We born again for a new world, a new life and a new position,
To be different in right monent, we´re and living ways of changes.

We born again for a new world, a new life and a new position,
