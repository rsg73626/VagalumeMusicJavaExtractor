THE OLD MAN

I believed that I could see it all
When the old man sings the song of life
You leave it down
Just pray for my mind
When the time has come to realize

I wanna know will you still remember me?
When the sun is set behind the fears
Keep a secret and hold it
Right between your hands
My pain will get along with your tears

On my way men
From the crimson skies

And the old man sings the song I know
While he moves down below
I take myself into my dreams
And the old man sings this song
This song I wrote

I believed that I could see it all
When the old man sings the song of life
You leave it down
Just pray for my mind
When the time has come to realize

And this old man sings the song I know
While he moves down below
I take myself into my dreams
And the old man sings this song
This song I wrote
