COME BACK LIFE

Your eyes
Do reflect the world
That I call my own

Thrown in a cage
Around my life
Where I was thrown

Hello darkness
My old friend
I wanna talk to you again

As the stories stay the same
Despite waiting all the way

The answer
To the questions that go by in you

The kingdom
Of my heart is within you

By night
Some thinks they seem to be the same

Oh I
Oh how I wish the wind could change

Come back life
All is forgiven now

I'll take you back
Half for any how

Let me go
Oh, let me go

I will forgive
Let me forget

You think
You care about you wish you could

And I
I know you can and I wish you would
