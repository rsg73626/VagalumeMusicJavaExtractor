BACK HOME

Some times in life
We have to forget
Don't talk to much
You did what you could
The face in the mood
Tring to figure it out
Losing all the truth
Turn it down
Shut up your mouth
We want everything now

I can't
Can't find my way
Back home

That's the reality
Live it day by day
The man who fight is
The man that dies
It's happening all the time
We've lost all the beliefs
We just want to fight
Starting now
Spill the blood
Alone in darkness we burn
