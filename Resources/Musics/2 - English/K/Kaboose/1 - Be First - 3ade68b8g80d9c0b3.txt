BE FIRST

He's back in the lab
He's mastered the craft
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first
He's back where it's at
He's packing them raps
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first

I stay blasting with words of passion
Never the type to write in an unorderly fashion
It's Christ, family, then hip hop, it's everlasting
I stick with mic mashing, quick to make it happen
Got my people all over saying "Time for action! "
So I feed off the adrenaline then start reacting
Come equipped to rip, rocking mic's in closed caption
I penetrate minds with lines that stay accurate
Do what I say with no delay, I'm not a pacifist
I fight for the cause and let love be my purpose
Look to the skies and reach high as a servant
So bare witness when I kick this verbal fitness

He's back in the lab
He's mastered the craft
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first
He's back where it's at
He's packing them raps
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first

I run laps with raps to catapult your interest
From simple to complex to simply complex lyrics
Through blood, sweat and tears I perspirate vision
Do what it takes to awake mind states and give them
Lifelines pipelined through your sound system
Some would say a positive rapper, others say Christian
But I stand as a man who seeks
to use what I've been given
Learn from my mistakes and elevate with tools to fix them
Improve the transmission, heavy on the grind
And never lose my ambition, steady with my time
To climb with rhyme skills, build and kill that nonsense
Use knowledge and wisdom
to bring it back to the essence

He's back in the lab
He's mastered the craft
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first
He's back where it's at
He's packing them raps
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first

You can call it poetry or call it music
I call it medicine when I'm peddling word fusion
Saturated in sounds to set the mood in orbit
Rotating the sun until I'm back on course it's
A matter of facts cause the fact of the matter is
I rip tracks to kick facts remain a catalyst
To battle this life of an average rhyme ripper
Trying to climb your spine into your mind to give ya
Music from the soul in the form of hip hop
Non-stop around the clock, I got to rock the spot
Make it hot for my people all across the globe
Travel and unravel the depths of my soul

He's back in the lab
He's mastered the craft
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first
He's back where it's at
He's packing them raps
The first shall be last
Kaboose shall be first
