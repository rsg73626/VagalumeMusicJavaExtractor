THE WALTZ

"The Waltz"

The touch - The rush...oh [3x]

You turn around and make me wanna make you think I'm in to you
An easy catch - the perfect guy with perfect lines - it's nothing new
I guess I'll let you have a little taste cause I have nothing here to lose
And if nothing's better than this then I guess that's better than nothing
What cha think I'll do?

The more you play hard to get
The more I think I could get in to you
The way you dance and walk away
I can't believe you're gettingme confused!

[chorus]
You make me feel so...
You make - you make - you make
You make me feel so...
Let's go - you know - take it slow - uh uh

You say don't worry baby I've got it all under control, and I'm like...
Yeah right Casanova I'm gonna waltz right over you
You play your petty games and I have to admit it's sorta kinda cute
But it won't be enough to make me fall in love with a shallow guy like you

You're so naive if you believe
I'd fall under your spell just cause you snap
What's wrong with me could ya tell me please
How did you ever manage to do that?

[chorus]

The touch - The rush...oh [4x]

[chorus 2x]

DUM DUM - DUM DUM DUM
DUM DUM - DUM DUM DUM
DUM DUM - DUM DUM DUM
IT'S LIKE
DUM DUM - DUM DUM DUM
