MAKE YOU LOVE ME

Can't walk down the street
Can't sit in my room
Can't close my eyes
Without thinking of you
Can't smell a rose
Can't look at the moon
Can't take a breath
Without missing you

It's such a beautiful thing
But it doesn't make sense
Without you babe
If I could I would make you love me
If I could I would leave this place
I'm the one who could make you happy
I try so hard but I can't walk away

Why can't you be here
Why did you leave
Is it my fault
You don't love me
Why do I cry
Why don't you call
Why does it seem
You don't care at all

You don't feel a thing
I don't understand
Why I need you babe
I'm the one who could make you happy
I try so hard but I can't walk away

Get away get away
If I could I would make you love me
If I could I'd forget your face
I know I could make you happy
I try so hard but I can't get away
Get away from you
