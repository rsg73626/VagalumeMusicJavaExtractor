INSTIGATOR

"Instigator"

Dark mascara on my eyes and I've got
My black shirt and my jeans fittin' just right
Val and I gonna kick it tonight like
Dum dum dum - dum dum dum
Leave to house in the car goin' to the club
Slide through the doors give my girl a good luck
Gonna scan the floor to find myself my first stud
Dum dum dum - dum dum dum

[chorus]
I'm an in I'm an instigator
Is that your boy? Girl we'll see you later!
I'm a tra I'm a trouble maker
One boy - two boys - three boys - and I...
I'm an in I'm an instigator
And if he's cute then I'll take the waiter!
I'm a bum I'm a bum bum shaker
One boy - two boys - three boys - and I...

All the girls here seem to have an attitude
But there aint no stoppin' me - I'm in a party mood
2am and the bass still kicks like
Dum dum dum - dum dum dum
My girl Val's hittin' it with the bad boys
And I'm shake - shakin' it with the shy boys
And we won't leave till we've had all the hott boys
Dum dum dum - dum dum dum

[chorus]
