FIRST KISS

Hey, Yeah
Will I close my eyes?
Will I hold my breath?
Will I want to cry?
Will our souls connect?
I've been thinking about it 
When I go to bed
At night I wonder, wonder

Will you hold my hand?
Will you speak of love?
Will the stars be shinning in the sky above?
Will it be all that I've been dreaming of
For so long, holding on

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know I'm gonna say
Wait on my lips

Will it taste like candy?
Will it be that sweet?
Will our hearts be racing
To a heavenly beat?
Will the moment sweap me of my feet,
And draw me under, under?

Will I tramble, tramble?
When I beg for more?
Will it be like anything I've never felt before?
Will we be down for a little more?
One thing I, I know fore sure..

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know I'm gonna say
Wait on my lips

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know what It's gonna stay,
Gonna say now

I can picture it all, inside my head
Just how It's going to be.
But a girl can only dream so much.
Well, now she wants to make it real.
Make it real

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait,
Wait for me
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know I'm gonna say
Wait on my lips

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait,
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know It's gonna stay
Gonna stay now

Make it real now

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait,
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know I'm gonna say

Our first kiss won't be the last time
Our love is too deep to end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait,
I belive it's only time
That keeps us from the thing devine
And when it's here you know I'm gonna say
Wait on my lips
