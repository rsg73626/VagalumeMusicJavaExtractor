YOU FOOL

It's in your eyes
It's in your smile
You couldn't hide it if you tried
You can't deny
It's on you mind
And I won't lie to you
I feel it too

[chorus]
Just close your eyes and kiss me you fool
WHat are you waiting for
It's just me and you
This moment is yours
You know what to do
Just pull me close to you
You fool

Without words
Without a sound
I can still hear you speak
Don't be afraid
There's no doubt
There's something between us
To believe in...
Oh...

[chorus]

It's all in your hands
So hold me while you can
Don't let this go
You fool

[chorus]
