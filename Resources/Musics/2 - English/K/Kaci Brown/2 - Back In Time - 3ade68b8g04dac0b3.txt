BACK IN TIME

As a result of all the little things you claim to do
I bite my pride and sincerely thank you
For what, I cannot say
Will always haunt my mind
What goes around eventually come back in time

I'll have a partial smile with sad eyes on the side
I guess to fully live we have to cry
Some people think that it's alright
But what goes around will eventually come back in time

Run, run, run
I run at last
You placed the cross that's on my back
When the curtains close you know that I'll be fine
What goes around will eventually come back in time

The treasures that I hold inside I made myself
They're safe and put on the highest shelf
I'll give you little pieces, but they're always mine
What goes around eventually come back in time

Run, run, run
I run at last
You placed the cross that's on my back
When the curtains close you know that I'll be fine
What goes around will eventually come back in time

As a result of all the little things you claim to do
I bite my pride and sincerely thank you
For what, I cannot say
Will always haunt my mind
What goes around eventually come back in time

What goes around comes around
