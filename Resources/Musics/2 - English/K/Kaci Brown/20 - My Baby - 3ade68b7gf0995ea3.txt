MY BABY

Lights are turned down way down low
Get on the floor now here we go
Move a little closer rock my body
Feelin' kinda hot but don't get naughty

[chorus]
My baby turn me on
My baby turn me on
Give me what I want - want what I want
You know what I want - I want it baby
Give me what I want - want what I want
You know what I want
Dance with me baby
My baby turn me on

Crank the noise up way up high
I could dance to this all night
Don't stop baby don't you leave
Cause I can feel you feelin' me

[chorus 2x]
