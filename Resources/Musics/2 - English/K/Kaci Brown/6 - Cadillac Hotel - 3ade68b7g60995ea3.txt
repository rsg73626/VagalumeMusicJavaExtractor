CADILLAC HOTEL

"Cadillac Hotel"

Crazy man's preachin' in the street in the mornin'
Sayin' white man's corrupted the world
And Jesus aint comin'
The seagulls are laughin' and I finish my coffee
In a little cafe on the corner of Rose and Dudley
The sand falls from my hand as I pick up my guitar
I lay out a blanket - kiss the sun as I sing
Words from my heart...
Then you make your way to the place where I am and I'm like hey
Won't you come listen to me play

[chorus]
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel
I wanna spend the whole night under the stars
Singing to you until...
I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel with you

The evening sun falls in to the ocean over
Malibu skies
And I can't help but drown in the blue of your emerald eyes
Your smile and say hey baby - won't you come up to my room
And I'm like...
Just come with me I know a place with a better view

[chorus]

The moon lights your face in the dark of the night
I pull you in with my sweet lullaby
The city is sleeping, I'm melting inside...
La la la la la la la

[chorus]
