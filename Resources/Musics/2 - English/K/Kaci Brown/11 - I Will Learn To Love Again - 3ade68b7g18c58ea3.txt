I WILL LEARN TO LOVE AGAIN

To love again (x5) 

Drowning in tears, that won't be me 
I will soon be free from the chains of all this pain inside 
And though I cry, it won't be long 
Til I regain the strength to know I can go on 
I will find my way 
Through the heartbreak 
I will not give up on love 
I believe 

I will learn to love again 
I will learn to trust 
Once this heart can start to mend 
I will learn to learn to love again 

All of these tears, time will dry them 
I will survive them and make it through into another day 
All of this pain, time will heal it 
There will be a time sometime I know 
I won't feel it 
I will live through life without you 
After the hurting is done 
I believe 

I will learn to love again 
I will learn to trust 
Once this heart can start to mend 
I will learn to learn to love again 

And I will find someone who deserves my touch 
After all the hurt is through I will be so over you 
I will not give up on love 
I believe 
Yeah 

I will learn to love again 
I will learn to trust 
Once this heart can start to mend 
I will learn to love again 
Ohh yeah, yeah 
Again 
I will love again 
To love again (fades)
