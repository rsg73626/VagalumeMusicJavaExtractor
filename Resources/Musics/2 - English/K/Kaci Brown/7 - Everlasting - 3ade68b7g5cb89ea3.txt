EVERLASTING

I've had enough of all these stops and starts
It always brings me back to these two hearts
Let's not put it to an end
Baby let's not lose it all again

Here we are at the start
Of another great adventure to the heart
Will it be everlasting
Now I know this is real
I've just got to let you the way I feel
You and me everlasting

I should have seen the pain I put you through
Forgive me for the things I did to you
I'm sorry if I let you down
I'll make it to your this time around

Here we are at the start
Of another great adventure to the heart
Will it be everlasting
Now I know this is real
I've just got to let you the way I feel
You and me everlasting

So if you need me, I will be there beside you
Just let it run free, I know that our love will take us through
