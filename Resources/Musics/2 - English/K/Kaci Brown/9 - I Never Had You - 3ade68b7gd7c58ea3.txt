I NEVER HAD YOU

Waiting for you to come back
But I can't help to think
You're something that I never had
Is It true or am I dreaming again
Chorus

I can't help pretending
That your only gone for the moment
I still dream of my happy ending
It's been so long since I've seen you
I won't be the one to chase you
I won't be you first love
I can't to help to think that I never had you
Ohh I never had you

Where are you now
Do you care about me
I keep telling myself its not my fault
You're not happy

Chorus

Am I shadow on your wall
Am I a figure of your imigation
Now you don't stand too tall
Please let me know what I am to you

Chorus
I never had you x3
