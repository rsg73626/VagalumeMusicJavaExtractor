I THINK I LOVE YOU

Do you think you love me? ohhheee
Do you think you love me? ohhhhh
Do you think you love me? ohhheee
Do you think you love me?

I think i love you!

I’m sleeping at night in the middle of a deep dream
And all at once i wake up
There’s something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before i go insane i hold my pillow to my head
I scream up in my bed
Screamin out the words i dread
I think i love you
Ohh
This morning i woke up
With this feeling i don’t know how to deal with
So i just decided to myself
Id hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when u walk in to the room

I think i love you

Chorus:
I think i love you so what am i so afraid of
I’m afraid that i’m not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I think i love you
Isn’t that what life is made of
So it worries me to say
That i never felt this way

Believe me you really don’t have to worry
I only wanna make you happy
And if u say go away i will
But i think better still i better stay around and love u
Do you think i have a case
Let me ask you to your face
Do you think u love me

Chorus

Do you think you love me?
Do you think you love me?
Do you think you love me?
Do you think you love me?

Don’t know what i’m up against oh no
Don’t know what it's all about oh no
I got so much to think about… (think about it)

Chorus to fade
