LIKE 'EM LIKE THAT

"Like 'Em Like That"

Boys all these boys only boys
Got nothing but boys on my mind
Asian Hispanic Caucasian and Black
So many I just can't decide
They lick their lips blow me a kiss
Whenever they see me walk by
Some cute some naughty some sweet sexy bodies
I just can't resist them cause I

[chorus]
I like I like I like 'em like that
I like I like I like 'em like that
I like I like I like 'em like that
I like 'em good, but I love 'em bad

Love is it love when a boy gets that look in his eyes (Ooh La La!)
They never quit coming they've got their something
They've got their je ne sais quoi
Instant attraction sweet satisfaction
Its almost too easy for me
To get into trouble cause boys are like bubbles
Their promises don't mean a thing, no no...

[chorus]

Give me a man that would give me the world
No I could never be his girl
But show me a man that has nothing I need
And he'll mean the world to me...

[chorus]
