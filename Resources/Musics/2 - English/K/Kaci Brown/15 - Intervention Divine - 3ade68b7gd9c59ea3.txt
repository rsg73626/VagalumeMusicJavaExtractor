INTERVENTION DIVINE

Sarah's screaming,
Another Daddy's leaving,
How can that much hurt be justified?
Ooh,
Frankie's a dealer,
His nickname is 'The Healer',
He makes a living helping people die,
Babies making babies,
People going crazy,
Andy's new best friends are 45.

[Chorus]
Circle us with Angels,
Walk us through the danger,
Give us light to get us
Through the valley full of shadows and
Deliver us from evil, we are only people,
You know we can't make it on our own
Oh,Lord,we need Intervention Divine.

Hei-ei-ei-iii

Michael's surfing,
Revenge at school is certain,
He's clicking Triple W dot bomb,
Street gang invasions,
We've become a dead bolt nation,
Security and innocence are gone,
We're still discriminating,
We're angry and we're hating,
We're living in a modern Babylon.

[Repeat chorus x2]

Ooh
From America to Asia,
Europe to Australia,
We're on our knees
Lord, hear you're children cry.

Our Father in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy name
Forgive us, and lead us
Oh Lord we need.

[Repeat chorus]

Circle us with Angels.....
Deliver us from evil,
we are only people.
