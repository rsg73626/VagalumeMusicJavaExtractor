I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR HEART THIS TIME

Everytime I see you baby I get crazy dizzy
playin like I'm busy
And I never stop to notice you around the friends
the crew I bet you never knew
The feeling that I always hide away no longer will I
keep locked up so deep in me
Gonna use what I got, to get what I want.
I'm not gonna stop till I break your heart.

Well I used to sit up in my room waiting
for the phone to ring
Wishing that it was my baby
Drifting down the hallways just a praying
for my pager to sing
Didn't know what to do I went crazy
So I searched for a spell I could put you under
And I waited and I wondered
Heard a voice on the breeze of a distant thunder
Saying, take him if you want him girl you know
what you gotta do

Come on Come on
I'm gonna break your heart this time oh baby
Here I am
I'm gonna make you see that your
love will be mine
Come on Come on
I'm gonna break your heart this time
Baby I have arrived
And I'm right on time
My time for breaking your heart my baby

I know you don't consider the potential
to be much more than friends,
If I left it to you baby
So I intend to show you what a girl can
do when she plays to win
So you better come through, and get crazy
So we danced for the stars we were wishing under
And we waited and we hungered

Heard a voice on the breeze of a distant thunder
Saying show him what you've got, you know the
powers in you

Everytime I see you baby I get crazy dizzy
playin like I'm busy
And I never stop to notice you around the friends
the crew I bet you never knew
The feeling that I always hide away no longer will I
keep locked up so deep in me
Gonna use what I got, to get what I want.
I'm not gonna stop till I break your heart.

My time for breaking your heart...
