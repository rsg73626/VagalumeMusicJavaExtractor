SOS

"SOS"

Staring at the phone all day won't make you call me
And sittin here plain' it off won't change a thing
Writin love letters that I'd never dare to send you won't tell you
How far deep I've gone since I met you

[chorus]
I feel I'm stranded on an island
ANd you're miles away from here
I try to make waves but the ocean's quiet
Can anybody hear
My SOS

Closing my eyes to the truth won't persuade you
And letting you hold my heart will only cause more pain
Whispering prayers in the wind cannot save me
Cause I'm still holding on to what's been gone

[chorus 2x]
