FLAGSTAFF BY MORNING

Flagstaff by morning,
She don't know i'm coming.
Maybe i'll wake her softly from a dream she's dreamin' sweet.
Flagstaff by morning,
She don't know i'm coming.
Maybe i'll just gently slip between the sheets.
I promised her one day
My songs would make the big time
And i'd buy her a big house where the hills meet the sky.
Well, i'm still playin' jukejoints
And very roadside attraction.
My dreams may be grounded but my pick-up can fly to
Flagstaff by morning,
She don't know i'm coming.
Maybe i'll wake her softly from a dream she's dreamin' sweet.
Flagstaff by morning,
She don't know i'm coming.
Maybe i'll just gently slip between the sheets.
