MOLLY IN THE MIRROR

Molly's in the attic as the sun goes down
Looking through some boxes for her wedding gown

Now she's standing in the mirror in dusy white
Talking to herself in the rusty light

She says "I've never been to Paris, but I've wanted to go
To see the moon reflecting in the Seine, you know
To climb the Eiffel tower with the city lights sparkling below

Now they're just some tired cliche's
Just some wrinkles that the mirror betray
Singing old woman, old woman what have you done with you days

I've never been to Venice, but my dreams are divine
Riding gondolas under lantern shine
Listening to guitars and sipping sweet Italian wine

Now they're just some tired cliche's
Just some wrinkles that the mirror betray
Singing old woman, old woman what have you done with you days

I was a wife
I raised a child
But in my dreams I still go running wild
It's a good life
I see my friends
But can this be how all my dreaming ends?

I've never seen Morokko, but the things I had planned
To savour all the spices in that faraway land
To buy a silk sarong and wear it dancing in the sand

Now they're just some tired cliche's
Just some wrinkles that the mirror betray
Singing old woman, old woman what have you done with you days
Old woman, old woman what have you done with your days
Old woman, old woman what have you done with your days
