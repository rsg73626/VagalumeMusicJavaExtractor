WAITING IN GREEN VELVET

Waiting in green velvet with a suitcase in her hand,
Standing down a ways from the bus stop sign,
Looking at the sky, like she was bound for the promised land,
Checkin' out her watch like she was losing time.
She was checkin' out her watch like she was losing time.
Thought i heard her talkin' somethin' 'bout
"rainbow lights, a psychedelic sight, it'll be here soon,
Comin' down to fly us all away.
Can't you hear the roar of the distant engines from a far-off moon?
Are you packed and ready for judgement day?"
So i just sat there on the bus stop bench awhile
And watched her stare into the sun.
Reminded me what my grandma said when i was just a child,
"that'll hurt your eyes, dear little one,
That'll hurt your eyes, dear little one."
Thought i heard her talkin' somethin' 'bout
"rainbow lights, a psychedelic sight, it'll be here soon,
Comin' down to fly us all away.
Can't you hear the roar of the distant engines from a far-off moon?
Are you packed and ready for judgement day?"
The bus pulled up and i got in but the girl didn't even move.
This was not the ride she was waiting for.
The bus driver just shook his head 'cause there's nothing in the world to do
And i waved good-bye through the slowly closing door.
I just waved good-bye through the slowly closing door.
Thought i heard her talkin' somethin' 'bout
"rainbow lights, a psychedelic sight, it'll be here soon,
Comin' down to fly us all away.
Can't you hear the roar of the distant engines from a far-off moon?
Are you packed and ready for judgement day?"
