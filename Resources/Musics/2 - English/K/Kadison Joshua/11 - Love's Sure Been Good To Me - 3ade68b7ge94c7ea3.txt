LOVE'S SURE BEEN GOOD TO ME

The morning sunrise through the window spillin' on to your pillow,
And as i watch you sleepin' sweet as can be,
I say to myself, "love's sure been good to me."
Last night's clothes scattered here and there, a sleepin cat on the old green
Chair
And your arms around me gracefully.
I say to myself, "love's sure been good to me."
Love's sure been good, love's sure been good,
Love's sure been good to me.
To fall asleep in your arms each night,
Then to wake to hold you by the morning light,
Love's sure been good to me.
Now, a smile crosses your face as your eyes wake to this place
And your lips press to mine so tenderly
And i say, "love's sure been good to me."
Love's sure been good, love's sure been good,
Love's sure been good to me.
To fall asleep in your arms each night,
Then to wake to hold you by the morning light,
Love's sure been good to me.
