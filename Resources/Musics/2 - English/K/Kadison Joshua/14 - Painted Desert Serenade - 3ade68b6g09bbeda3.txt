PAINTED DESERT SERENADE

He tells her "I wanna paint you naked on a big brass bed,
with bright orange poppies all around your head"
And she says "Crazy old man, Im not young anymore"
"Thats all right" He whispers. "I've never painted before."

Chorus: And do you love me Lady Jane, Lady Jane?
Do you love me Lady Jane, Lady Jane?
You got me talking to the moon, you got me walking in the rain.
Do you love me? Do you love me, Lady Jane?

Oh, and I wanna read your tea leaves by candle-light
On a fat red velvet sofa, I wanna be with you all night
I wanna tickle your feet, with a peacock plume
And she says "Can you talk a little softer, there are people in the room"

CHORUS

Jane says "My children bought me here, and promised they'd call"
"But you know that kids forget, thats the way that they are"
And he says "Well that makes us both footloose and fancy-free, so Jane,
do you wanna come see the painted desert with me?"

CHORUS

Do you love me, do you love me like I love you, Lady Jane?
