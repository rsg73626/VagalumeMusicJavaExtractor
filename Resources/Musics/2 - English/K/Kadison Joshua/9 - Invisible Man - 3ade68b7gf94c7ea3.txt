INVISIBLE MAN

Woke up this morning with a funny feeling,
Wasn't really sure what it was all about.
But it felt like i was dissapearing,
So i ran to the mirrow to check it out.
I said, "here i am, here i am, here i am
...but why do i feel like the invisible man?"
I stumbled back into the bedroom,
And stared up at the rising sun.
Then i heard my self shout out the window,
Not really talking to anyone,
I yelled, "here i am, here i am, here i am
...but why do i feel like the invisivle man?"
Lights went on, people started
Yelling,
"will the crazy man go back to bed."
And there i was, laughing out my window,
Feeling much better now, somebody heard what i said.
Well it's no big thing, no revelation,
No answer to all these lives we lead.
But i think i do know one thing:
Sometimes i think we all need to say,
"here i am, here i am, here i am."
When life makes us feel like the invisible man?
Lights went on, people started yelling,
"will the crazy man go back to bed."
And there i was, laughing out my window,
Feeling mu
Ch better now, somebody hear what i said.

Oh, here i am, here i am, here i am
...but sometimes i feel like the invisible,
Here i am, here i am, here i am
...but why do i feel like the invisible man?
