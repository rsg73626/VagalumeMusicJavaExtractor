THE SONG ON NEFFERTITI'S RADIO (MY LOVE)

A heart is fragile, baby.
It can break so easily.
So, just for safe keeping, darlin',
Why don't you give your heart to me?
Don't you know...
My love won't ever let you down?
My love won't ever let you down.
Trust in me, baby.
What i feel is real and true
And i just want to spend my life
Idolizing you.
My love won't ever let you down.
My love won't ever let you down.
I'll never lie to you darling,
I just ain't that way.
I'll stand right by you, baby,
Forever, come what may.
Lay your head on my shoulder
And dance with me real slow.
Listen to the words
Of the song i'm singing low.
Don't you know,
My love won't ever let you down?
My love won't ever let you down.
