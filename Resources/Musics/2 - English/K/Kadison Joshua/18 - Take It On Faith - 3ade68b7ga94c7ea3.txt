TAKE IT ON FAITH

Hey, I didn't mean a thing I said last night.
I swear I didn't mean a word I used.
You don't have to listen, baby. You have every right
to feel that heart of yours has been abused.
I know I've used up all my chances a long, long time ago
and I really don't deserve to call you mine,
but, if I told you that I loved you, could I lay back down beside you?
Could you take it on faith one more time?
Look at me I'm crying... imagine me crying.
Well, it's time I learned to anyway,
'cause if you're really set on one of us leaving,
I guess there's really nothing left to say.
It seems like such a shame,
but baby, I could never blame you, baby,
for leaving this old story far behind
and if I told that I love you, could I lay back down beside you?
Could you take it on faith one more time?
I know I promised to you before
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you no more.
If I could take it all back and start again... take it all back, well maybe
then,
I could tell you that I love you. I could lay back down beside you.
I could tell you that I love you, lay back down beside you.
If I told you that I love, could I lay back down beside you?
Could you take me on faith one more time?
