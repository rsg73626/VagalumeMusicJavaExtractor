WHEN A WOMAN CRIES

When a woman cries, when a woman cries,
She can wash your world away.
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes,
You never know just what to say.
Don't say a word, don't say anything.
She don't need your truth or lies.
Just hold her close and love her.
When a woman cries.
When a woman cries, when a woman cries,
There is no sadder songs.
So you apologize, you apologize,
Even if you don't know what you've done wrong.
But if you really want to make her happy,
To stop her sobbing and her sighs,
Just hold her close and love her,
When a woman cries.
Now, don't you waste your time thinking
'bout the right thing to say.
Just put your arms around her
'till the clouds roll away.
When a woman cries, when a woman cries,
She can tear your dreams apart.
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes
It can break a...break a man's heart.
And if you find that you are crying too,
Don't let if come as no suprise.
Just hold her close and love her
When your woman cries.
