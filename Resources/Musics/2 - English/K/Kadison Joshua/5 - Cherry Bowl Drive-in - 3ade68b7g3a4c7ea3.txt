CHERRY BOWL DRIVE-IN

Saw her at the Texaco just the other day.
Even more beautiful, her hair had a touch of grey.
We both stood and stared at each other, couldn't say a word.
Then I said "God, it's good to see you."
And she said "Well, have you heard...
"They're tearin' down the Cherry Bowl Drive-In tommorow
Where I first kissed you and ran my fingers through your hair.
She's goin' the way all things must go someday
but I will still remember you there.
Yes, I will. Yes, I will.
I will still remember you there."
Then I said, "Little Melissa, she's lookin' more and more like you.
Saw her down on Maple Street, she's even got your same smile, too.
And my Jake Jr. says 'Daddy, someday I'm gonna marry that girl.'
Isn't that just perfect? Such a crazy world.
"So, they're tearin' down the Cherry Bowl Drive-In tommorow?
Where I first kissed you and ran my fingers through your hair.
She's goin' the way all things must go someday
but I will still remember you there.
Yes, I will. Yes, I will.
I will still remember you there.
"Hey, can you get away tommorow?
If you can't, I understand
It's just that when the big screen falls
I'd like to be holdin' your hand,
holdin' your hand
"when they're tearin' down the Cherry Bowl Drive-In tommorow.
Where I first kissed you and ran my fingers through your hair.
She's goin' the way all things must go someday
but I will still remember you there.
Yes, I will. Yes, I will.
I will still remember us there.
