GEORGIA RAIN

When all my dreams are fallin' on stony ground
And i start wonderin' why i'm even around,
Can't find the sunshine anywhere,
Jessie puts her arms around me and runs her fingers throgh me hair.
And jessie sings soft as the georgia rain
Comin' down easy o
N a windowpane.
And jessie sings warm as the late night summer breeze
Hummin' some faraway tune to the willow trees.
And life is everything god meant it to be
When jessie's singing soft as the georgia rain to me.
She call me angel and says, "let me dry your eyes.
You mean by now you still don't realize
That everything i want is what i got.
So angel stop your thinkin' 'bout all the things your not."
And jessie sings soft as the georgia rain
Comin' down easy on a windowpane.
And jessie sings warm as
The late night summer breeze
Hummin' some far away tune to the willow trees.
And life is everything god meant it to be
When jessie's singing soft as the georgia rain to me.
There's a trailer by the sea down in mexico.
We dreamt a lot about it but we never did go.
Some dreams are better from afar, that's just how things are.
And everything's alright 'cause jessie's singing me to sleep tonight.
Jessie's singing me to sleep tonight.
And jessie sings soft as the georgia rain
Comin' down easy on a window
Pane.
And jessie sings warm as the late night summer breeze
Hummin' some far away tune to the willow trees.
And life if everything god meant it to be
When jessie's singing soft as the georgia rain to me
When jessie's singing soft as the georgia rain t
O me.
