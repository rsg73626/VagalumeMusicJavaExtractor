BEGGING FOR GRACE (DRAGONFLY WINGS)

I was locked up in a crazy place
They found me on the streets begging for grace
I don't remember but they say I lost my mind

She was in the garden after the rain
In a white robe we were dressed the same
She took my hand and said my eyes looked kind
Then she said,

"You must be the boy she sent me from the other side
Well, I've been waiting for the longest time
And you can tell her it's been a crazy ride
Tell her I think I've learned the lessons she sent me to learn
Tell her I think I know what I wanna be should I return

I wanna be blues, I wanna be greens
I wanna be flying on dragonfly wings"

Sittin' on the banks where the river twists
Showing me the marks up and down her wrists
She told me there was sacred writing in the lines

She said the language was from a long time ago
And she could find out all she wants to know
If she could just decipher those sacred signs

"You must be the boy she sent me from the other side
Well, I've been waiting for the longest time
And you can tell her it's been a crazy ride
Tell her I think I've learned the lessons she sent me to learn
Tell her I think I know what I wanna be should I return

I wanna be blues, I wanna be greens
I wanna be flying on dragonfly wings"

I found her walking in the northern fields
I said I had to leave, 'cause they called me healed
I told her I could see my face in the mirror again

She said, "Should you ever see the Dragonfly Queen
Tell her I'm a waiting for my wings
Tell her I'll be waiting where the river bends

I wanna be blues, I wanna be greens, I wanna be flyin' on
I wanna be blues, I wanna be greens, I wanna be flyin' on
I wanna be blues, I wanna be greens, I wanna be flyin' on dragonfly wings

Blues, greens, flyin' on dragonfly wings
Blues, greens, flyin' on dragonfly wings

I wanna be blues, greens, flyin' on dragonfly wings
Blues, greens, flyin' on dragonfly wings
Blues, greens, flyin' on dragonfly wings
