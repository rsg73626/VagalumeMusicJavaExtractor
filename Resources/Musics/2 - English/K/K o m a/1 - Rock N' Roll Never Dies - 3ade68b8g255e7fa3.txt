ROCK N' ROLL NEVER DIES

Where I search for inspiration
There´s no place for evil waves
From deep inside my heart 
My words come to light
Immortalized in my songs
Lullabies for other souls
A heritage of mankind
Keeps spreading happiness
Let the true sound roll

Almost all my idols passed by
My tribute to every one of then

Nobody will stop this fire
Burning out of control
All I wanna hear is rock´n roll
Believe me honey cause I never lie
Rock´n Roll Never Dies 

The radio plays what I used to hear
When I was a little child
Reminding me of what mama said
Oldies are always the best
Yeah, but if it comes from the heart
New things can also be great
