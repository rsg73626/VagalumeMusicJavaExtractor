I AM MURLOC

From the coasts of Westfall.
To Black Fathom Deeps.
Silent I'll hunt you.
Silent I will creep.
Gliding trough the depths.
Gliding to your death.
Upon the shore I rise.
Hold my flippers to the skies.
I am more than a fish.
I am more than a man.
Death will rise from the tide.
I am murloc!
I am king of the sea.
But I'm not Aqua man!
Death will rise.
Hear our cry!
I am murloc!
Hunter of the tides.
I will end your life.
Mourn your fallen brave.
Sleep in a sunken grave.
Feel the deadly fin.
My nets drag you in.
Blood stained sand and gore.
All that's left upon the shore.
I am more than a fish.
I am more than a man.
Death will rise from the tide.
I am murloc!
I am king of the sea.
But I'm not Aqua man!
Death will rise, hear our cry!
I am murloc!

Empty eyes, never blinking.
Armored scales, but never sinking.
Puddlejumper, the Coastal Runner.
Call me, the Tide Hunter!
Raise your flippers to the sky.
I am more than a fish.
I am more than a man.
Death will rise from the tide.
I am murloc!
I am king of the sea.
Not a queen like Aqua man!
Death will rise, hear our cry!
I am murloc!
I am death!
