POWER OF THE HORDE

Storm, earth and fire... heed my call...

I am the son of the wind and rain,
Thunder beckons and i heed the call.
If i die upon this day,
In battle i will fall.

Hear me brothers gather up the wolves, (howl)
To battle, we will ride.
Wardrums echo the beating heart,
Pounding from inside.

Storm
Black clouds fill the sky.
Earth
I hear my battle cry.
Fire
Thunder will bring forth...
Death
From the power of the horde...

Farseer to the warsong clan,
To no matter will i kneel.
Feel the power and the energy,
For the black blood, honor and steel.

I feel the fire burning in my veins,
Lightning strikes at my command.
By storm and earth, axe and fire,
We come to claim this land.

Storm
Black clouds fill the sky.
Earth
I hear my battle cry.
Fire
Thunder will bring forth...
Death
From the power of the horde...

Yeeeeaaaahhhh!

Surrounded by the enemy,
The wolf among the hounds.
Thunder turns to silence it-
Took the hundred to bring me down.

Wolf brothers falling at my side,
With honor i will die.
Upon the altar of the storms,
I will be reborn.

Storm
Black clouds fill the sky.
Earth
I hear my battle cry.
Fire
Thunder will bring forth...
Death
For i have been reborn.

Storm
Earth
Fire
Death (death sound)
The power of the horde........
