PULL UP (FT. IAMSU!, KID INK & SAGE THE GEMINI)

[hook: Kid Ink]
I know, I know, you been waitin' all night
it's alright, I know what you wanna get full of
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up

[verse 1: Kid Ink]
pull up right on your bumper
more like right on that dump truck
nah, you ain't lookin' for no butler
you a bad bitch, lookin' for some tough love
but I ain't gon' chase, not a hunter
back then used to pull up in a Honda
now I don't pull up if it ain't valet
hood nigga lost in the valley
what you sayin', what you sayin'
when I pull off, no these bitches ain't stayin'
they ain't with me, these niggas just stains
it's a after party, tell me where you stayin'

[hook]
I know, I know, you been waitin' all night
it's alright, I know what you wanna get full of
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up

[verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
heartbreak, see that's my game
niggas want beef, I tell 'em relax that plate
[?] and the plane smash into the altitude
but they start servin' drinks in the main cabin
grew up in the streets, if it ain't action
niggas couldn't go to sleep at night, we been action
2-2-3 thru a bullet wound
got some bullet wounds stretched from my bullet wound
niggas think they butterfly, I make 'em cocoon
[?]

[hook]
I know, I know, you been waitin' all night
it's alright, I know what you wanna get full of
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up

[verse 3: Iamsu!]
goin' in, more bars than a lifer
send a text, bet she pull up like a diaper
hyper, active, balin' no practice
smokin' on sherbert, we don't smoke cactus
pull up anytime, yeah still will, under still
tryna Ink the Kid like Ill Will
but I'm, self-made, self-paid my nigga
put my homies on the payroll and paid my niggas
hbk my nigga, we the wave, we the wave my nigga
brought the whole Bay back, we did it
makin' good with decisions so I decided to get it
so if you lookin' for me then you pull up wit it

[hook]
I know, I know, you been waitin' all night
it's alright, I know what you wanna get full of
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up, pull up
I'm bout to pull up
