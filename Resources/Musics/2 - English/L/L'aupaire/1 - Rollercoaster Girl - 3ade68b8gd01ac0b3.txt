ROLLERCOASTER GIRL

She looked like a barbie doll
And she's way too young
Smoking a cigarette like a rolling stone
She tells me about the life she lives
And the man she has
While asking for another beer, another smoke
Waiting for the phone to ring
Waiting for the show to sing
The cover's short and two front row seats
at the boxing ring
And I, I, want to save her
Oh oh, she, she's waved goodbye yeah
She tips the ash of a cigarette
And smiled
Rollercoaster girl
Rollercoaster world
Rollercoaster girl
Rollercoaster world
She wants to marry a money maker
Sooner or later
Buy her highs to dry her eyes
His credit card keeps her satisfied
She tells me about the life she lives
And a broken heart
It all started some years ago
Dancing in the club
Hanging in the pub
Getting high
On the the parking lot
And I want to save her
Oh oh, she, she's waved goodbye, yeah
She tip the ash of a cigarette
And smiled
Rollercoaster girl
Rollercoaster world
Rollercoaster girl
Rollercoaster world
Rollercoaster girl
Rollercoaster world
Rollercoaster girl
Rollercoaster world
