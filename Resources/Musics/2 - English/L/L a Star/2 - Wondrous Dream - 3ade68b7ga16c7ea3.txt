WONDROUS DREAM

Life is a wondrous dream, also it seems
When you belong to a posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
Was it all in your dream?

[ verse 1 ]
Many people and places i've been
Before you can start you first must end
Tend to all that is needed
Or your purpose in life is defeated
I know this from trial and practice
Stand up, young man, if you lack this
Knowledge to proceed, exact attitude
Get in the mood for a new interlude
Sonic call to arms
As a female stand and flex with her charms
Is it game on our feelings playing
Come on, boy, if you know what i'm saying
Each time, each day
A brother struggles, then lose his way
A path in the wrong direction
Searching for the meaning of perfection
Time and time and time again
A life decided by the point of a gun end
Oh, what a way to go
It was a brother we all know
Not yet lived, ain't full grown
Coffin closed cause a hole in your dome
Yo, life is a wondrous dream

Life is a wondrous dream, also it seems
When you belong to the posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
Was it all in a dream?

[ verse 2 ]
Knowledge reigns supreme over all
If you have it, you'll never fall
You can go up against the wall
Cause love conquer all
Preach, but pretend not to see it, reach
And some day try to be it, each
And every man must have a goal
Instead some sell their souls
To fly cars and truck gold
Tec-9, and you're ready to roll
If you could see within yourself
Feel how the next man felt
Bless the father, protect the son
Don't try to solve it with a gun



Nothing change when someone dies
Over money, drugs and lies
Wake up and ope
