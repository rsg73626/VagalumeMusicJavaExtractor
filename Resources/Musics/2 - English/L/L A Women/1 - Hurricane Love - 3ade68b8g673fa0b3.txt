HURRICANE LOVE

We're so loud
As we run around this empty town
And we get drowned
Headed back to my house, feeling so wild

You got me calling
Calling for that real love
Like a whirlwind
You got that hurricane love

The way you're taking me up
You got me hooked on your high love
Just like your beat in my heart
Oh, you're my hurricane love
Yeah, we just do what we want
And in the end we can break it off
Oh I just can't get enough
Of this hurricane love

She's at it again
Like a wildfire deep within you
You tell me we're friends
But we just sat only to pretend

The way you're taking me up
You got me hooked on your high love
Just like your beat in my heart
Oh, you're my hurricane love
Yeah, we just do what we want
And in the end we can break it off
Oh I just can't get enough
Of this hurricane love

The way you're taking me up
You got me hooked on your high love
Just like your beat in my heart
Oh, you're my hurricane love
Yeah, we just do what we want
And in the end we can break it off
Oh I just can't get enough
Of this hurricane love
