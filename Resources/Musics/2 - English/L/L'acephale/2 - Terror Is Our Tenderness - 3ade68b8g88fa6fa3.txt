TERROR IS OUR TENDERNESS

Throat opened by the sun
Cursed sky, black graveyard night
Cemetery of sleep
Mausoleum of human meat
Stench of death
A wall of sleep
Parched in holocaust
A barrow of shadows
Frozen black sun
Empty with fetid nausea
Wide dead eyes
Impenetrable night
Heavy with coffins
(Black wings silent)
The sweet dead dressed in a cemetery of sleep
Dark star and God damned graves
Feet in frozen earth
Arms aloft in infinite black night
Terror is our Tenderness
Black death our bread
Terror is our Tenderness
(Madness in hand, slit the throat of man.
Welcome the wretched sun and frozen light.
Airless icy maggot sun eclipse.)
