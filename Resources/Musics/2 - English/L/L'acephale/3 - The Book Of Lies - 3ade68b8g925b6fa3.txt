THE BOOK OF LIES

Daggers held aloft
Above the heart of earth underneath
Thought is disease
Depraved and debauched
To beget is to die
The broken manifests light
Cast the seed into the field of night

Nature is Cruel
Existence is Eternal Warfare
(the Universe is but a Coffin Worm)

The swollen mask mutters an Atheistâ€™s prayers
Sleep with faith and wake a corpse
Slaves of reason
Blind under the dominion of reason
In the coffin of our hopes
Death still lurks
Sealed in the tomb of the slain

Nature is Cruel
Existence is Eternal Warfare
(the Universe is but a Coffin Worm)

A-llumination.
