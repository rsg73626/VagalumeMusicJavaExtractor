CRYSTAL EYES

With crystal eyes she gazes
Like a desert flower
In the morning rain
She's well aware
of every promise made
She's a child of light
in a world of pain

Oh let her be free
Holy Zion
Give us eyes to see
Something to rely on

Crystal eyes, I still love you
You're my one desire
Crystal eyes, I can't live without your touch
You are my crystal eyes

Crystal eyes, she don't say much
But she sees right through
Your thin disguise
You'll never know she comes and goes
Slips through the veil of the dead of night

Oh let her be free
Holy Zion
Give us eyes to see
Something to rely on

Crystal eyes, I still love you
You're my one desire
Crystal eyes, I can't live without your touch
You are my crystal eyes

Crystal eyes, she's an angel
That fell to earth like a gift from God
Sweet, serene, skin like cream
My love protects your every thought

Oh let her be free
Holy Zion
Give us eyes to see
Something to rely on

Crystal eyes, I still love you
You're my one desire
Crystal eyes, I can't live without your touch
You are my crystal eyes
