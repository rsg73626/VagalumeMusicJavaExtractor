IT'S OVER NOW

It's Over Now - L.A.Guns

Just another night and I'm all alone
I wonder where you are, who you're holding
And I'm wasting time by the telephone
It gets harder when there's no way of knowing

I thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow, but it's over now
Thought you'd be comin' 'round, but it's over now

When I close my eyes, I can see your face
There was still so much to discover
All the time we shared can't be erased
No you're in the arms of another

I always thought we'll make it someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow, but it's over now
Thought you'd be comin' 'round, but it's over now

If you broke my heart, I can't let it show
I can take the pain, I can't let you go
Some people change, I guess it had to be
Even though you're gone now, you still mean so much to me...

Just another day, I'm still holdin' on
No matter how I try, I can't shake this feeling
Yeah I'm sitting here like nothing's wrong
I'm still lookin' for someone to believe in

I thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow, but it's over now
I thought you'd be comin' 'round, but it's over now
Coulda worked it out, but it's over now...
