NO MERCY

Come on Jane, I wanna hold ya tight, yeah
Give ya love, make you feel alright, yeah
I say the things that you wanna hear
I'm gonna whisper in your ear.

Show no mercy
Show no mercy
Show no mercy

But did you think you were the only one
Just a victim of a love and run
Lonely heart and a woman in black
I broke your heart and I ain't coming back

And I'm sorry if I broke your dream
Watch your life come apart at the seam
I know it ain't fair
I broke your heart, yeah yeah

Show no mercy
Show no mercy
Show no mercy

I'll be standing in the shadows of love

Hey yeah, so I'm indiscreet
Shattered dolls and a fait accompli
I wonder why, why I keep up the chase
I'm just a fool for a pretty face

Show no mercy
Show no mercy
Show no mercy
