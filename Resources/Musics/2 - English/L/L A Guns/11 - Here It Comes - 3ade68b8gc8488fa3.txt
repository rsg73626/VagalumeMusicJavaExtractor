HERE IT COMES

When you see me 
I'm coming down the road to your back door 
Sound of a gun - she stood there laughing 
Like her life has no tomorrow 
I watched her fade into the dark and cruel night 
Something sounded like a promise 
Round and round - heaven bound 
Stranded in a stranger's town 
Here it comes, Another heartache 
Here it comes, Another fall 
Girl, I want you 
You've got the prime time in my morning imagination 
I'll be creeping like perfumed smoke 
No place for you to hide 
I'm gonna shake you girl and keep you satisfied 
You and me, This time forever 
Feel the motion set me free 
Love the things you do for me 
Here it comes, Another heartache 
Here it comes, Another fall 
Sweet liberation, just like a woman 
She can make the water wine 
Jubilation, your sweet caresses 
Gonna drive me outta my mind 
I want to let you know just what you mean to me 
You and me this time forever 
Climb inside my Jaguar 
All your friends call you star 
Cross your fingers, make a wish 
Got the stuff I can't resist 
Here it comes, Another heartache 
Here it comes, Another fall
