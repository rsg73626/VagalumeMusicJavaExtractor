SEX ACTION

Talk about love
Talk about love

I've been around this great big world, yeah
Had my share of shady deals and girls, hey
Now, I've been thinking of the coming attraction
The wink of an eye and the gleam of satisfaction

Talk about love
Talk about love

Here she comes, never get enough
Of that sex action
Baby knows wherever she goes
She got sex action

Howze baby, I got the potion
You're a cool operator got the machine in motion
Now, we're all alone
Doing all the talking
She's got me on my back
Let her fingers do the walking

Talk about love
Talk about love

Here she comes, I never get enough
Of her sex action
Baby knows wherever she goes
She got sex action

Talk about love
Talk about love

Here she comes, I never get enough
Of that sex action
S-E-X, who's next, yeah
Sex action

And it always feels so good

Girl she got style
Boy she got sleaze
Ah, she's knocking them dead
She's got me down on my knees

Now listen, I'm a sex gun lover in the heat of the night
Don't run for cover I got you in my sights

Talk about love
Talk about love

Here she comes, I never get enough
Of that sex action
Baby knows wherever she goes
There'll be sex action
S-E-X, I know who's next for sex action
Baby knows wherever she goes
She's gonna get it (sex action)
She's gonna get it (sex action)
I'm gonna give to her (sex action), yeah

Sex (sex action)
