BIG HOUSE

Psychotic 
Neurotic 
Alcoholic 
You might call me imbecilic 
I'm dirty I'm so mean 
Like no other you've ever seen 
I'll take down the other side 
A place where you can meet and hide 
I'll take you down the darker way 
To a game - a game that I play 
And what you see is what you get 
A wicked man with no regrets 
I get whatever I want 
You won't forget 
Goin' back to the Big House 
Goin' back - back inside 
Pathetic, rejected, full of doom 
Some people call me Mr. Gloom 
I sold my soul - sold my soul 
When I went down the fire hole 
I'll take you down, down with me 
A nice place for you to be 
I'll take you down to my home 
I'll leave you there to die alone 
And what you see is what you get 
A wicked man with no regrets 
I get whatever I want 
You won't forget 
Goin' back to the Big House 
Goin' back - back inside 
Goin' back to the Big House 
Goin' back inside 
Goin' back to the Big House 
Goin' back inside - back inside 
Goin' back to the Big House 
Goin' back - back inside
