ELECTRIC GYPSY

Electric Gypsy - L.A.Guns

I need the highway wind blowin' in my hair
5 thousand miles I've roamed now, I'm gettin' there
This is my destiny, the way that I choose
Don't need no one to talk about, 'bout love and blues

Round, round, up and down, moves so fast, never touch the ground
High, high, touch the sky, don't come down, don't make me try
Lost in space or any other place, living my dream on the moving train
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow, yeah

I remember way back when, I was just like you
Yeah, I killed myself to live, but I didn't have a clue
I got saddled in chrome and steel
750 reasons why I can't stand still

Oh no, here I go, gotta keep moving, gotta let go
'Nother town, 'nother girl, can't stand still 'till I've seen the world
Till I've seen the world, when I cry, get in my spaceship, watch me fly
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow, yeah, ooh, ah...

Don't need no one to tell me to settle down
Life in the fast lane suits me to the ground
This is my destiny, the way that I choose
Don't need no one to tell me 'bout love and blues

Round, round, up and down, moves so fast, never touch the ground
High, high, touch the sky, don't come down, don't make me try
Lost in space or any other place, puttin' my dream on the moving train
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow
Gypsy, electric gypsy, oh
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow
Gypsy, electric gypsy, (n-n-no no) round I blow
Gypsy, electric gypsy, (oh oh oh oh oh) round I blow
Gypsy
