I FOUND YOU

Somebody love me 
Somebody care 
Somebody hold me 
When I am scared 
Somebody reach out and hold my hand 
Somebody somewhere must understand 
I found you 
You wanted me too 
Somebody touch me 
Somebody give 
Give me a reason 
I wanna live 
Oh, I don't ask for much 
All I want darling is a little trust 
I found you 
You wanted me too 
I found you 
You wanted me too 
Somebody trust me, Somebody care 
I ain't got much, girl 
But I'm willing to share 
Oh it's hard, this world can be so cold 
We all need a little love 
It's what makes us whole 
I found you 
You wanted me too
