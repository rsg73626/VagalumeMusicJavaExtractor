BITCH IS BACK

Yeah and this time comes in my life, hey what's your story
Save your conscience
For some other cheap soul Puerto Rican spiritual number
And I thought "The further from home, the closer to you"

I need a whiskey, I'm bleeding gasoline
You play the starring role in my psychedelic dream
Don't need no witness, don't need no referee
They're running hot tonight, her danger symphony

Please don't save me
Don't tell me when it's time to go
It could not faze me
I only want to let you know

Bitch is back, right on track
Bitch is back, I like it like that

Let me come inside your sacred heart
Let me feel your warm embrace
I love you, hate you, confiscate you
Can't live without your face
If you're in jail, I pay your bail
I shouldn't but it's a fact
Stop the world in motion, swim the ocean
Just to get you back

Please don't save me
Don't tell me when it's time to go
It, it could not faze me
I only wanna let you know

Bitch is back, right on track
Bitch is back, I like it like that, yes I do

Bitch

There ain't no justice, no need to compromise
There's so much mystery, behind those steel blue eyes
She give me music, she give me sanctuary
She moves just like the wind, her dark identity

Please don't save me
Don't tell me when it's time to go
It could not faze me
I only wanna let you know

Bitch is back
