SLEAZY COME EASY GO

Baby lives in a trailer park
Only comes out after dark
Hates her mom hates the old man
Don't like living in a caravan
Oh taxi cab
It ain't nice 4 girls 2 grab
She's leaving town on a greyhound bus

Doing time 4 your baby
Sleazy Come Easy Go
Doing time 4 your man
Anyway u can

New York City, Hollywood
Just like she always knew she would
She's riding high she's playing the game
Moving fast as a hurricane
Oh taxi cab
It ain't nice 4 girls 2 grab
don't make a sound don't make a fuss

Doing time 4 your baby
Sleazy Come Easy Go
Doing time 4 your man
Anyway u can

Private plane crystal queen best Peruvian
You've ever seen
Lady luck took a dive
She's in stir doing 3 to 5
Oh where's that cab, I told you it ain't nice 2 grab
She's leaving town in a greyhound bus

Doing time 4 your baby
Sleazy Come Easy Go
Doing time 4 your man
Anyway u can
