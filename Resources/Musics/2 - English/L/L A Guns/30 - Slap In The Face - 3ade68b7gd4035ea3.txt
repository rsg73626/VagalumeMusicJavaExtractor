SLAP IN THE FACE

Slap In The Face - L.A.Guns

Kamikaze hit man, love on the run
No mercy for the children of the night
You tangle on my brain, you drive me insane
I want what you got, no surprise

Cold sweat my hands shake

[Chorus:]
No point getting excited, she's on the case
Knock you off, knock you off your rocker
Like a slap, like a slap in the face

You fuss you fight, you think you got the right
Make love, the camera never lies
We got the power, we got the moves
14 thousand killer watts just to make you groove

And it's just like smoking lightning

[Chorus]...
