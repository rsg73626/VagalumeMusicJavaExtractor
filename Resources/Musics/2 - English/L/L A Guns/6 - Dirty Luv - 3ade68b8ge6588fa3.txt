DIRTY LUV

Come on everybody I'm back in town 
Gonna bring you up, gonna shake you down 
Gonna set you up to another place 
Gonna wipe that smile back on your face 
I'm calling all the home girls in L.A. 
I've got some thing good, gonna come your way 
All the fine girls from old Times Square 
I love your style and savour faire 
Don't want your conversation 
Don't want to talk about trust 
I want excitation 
I want your Dirty Luv 
Dirty Luv 
Come on little baby I love your stuff 
I'd die 4 U, Can't get enough 
I'm a back door lover in a limousine 
I'll show you streets you've never seen 
I'll do you baby 
Do you good 
On the trunk and on the hood 
Take it faster, take it faster 
Call me slave or call me master 
Don't want conversation 
Or the stars above 
Just gimme some stimulation 
and a slice of your Dirty Luv 
Dirty Luv 
I'm watchin' you 
Dirty Luv 
Oh come on baby 
Come on love 
My sweet baby got the stuff 
Don't want your complications 
Or the stars above 
Just gimme some stimulation 
I want a slice of your Dirty Luv 
Dirty Luv 
I'm watchin' you 
Dirty Luv 
Dirty Luv
