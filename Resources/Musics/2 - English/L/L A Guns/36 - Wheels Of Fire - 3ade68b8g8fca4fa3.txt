WHEELS OF FIRE

I've been dreaming 'bout this night 
Praise the lord 2 make things right 
Hold so tight 2 your embrace 
Feel your breath against my face 
Hey baby I've got plans 4 u 
There ain't nothing I won't do 
Set the spark that sets my soul on fire 
I'll take u higher, higher, higher 

Chorus 
I'm burning baby can't u see my hearts aflame 
I'll be the 1 u call by name 
There's no denying that u just take the pain 
I'll never ever break the chain 
Innocence fuels my desire 
Wheels Of Fire 

Darkness fall my blood starts racing 
My heart's beating like a drum 
Beating out like a jungle rhythm 
4 beats 2 the bar 
Falling down like thunder from heaven 
Shooting star 

Chorus

Wheels Of Fire
