MY KOO KA CHOO

When I saw you on the corner 
You looked like the cover of a magazine 
And I thought to myself 
She's about the finest thing I've ever seen 
Baby my blood was burning up 
I saw your face, wanted your love 
Looked in your eyes, it felt so right 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I am crazy for you 
Girl you put a spell on me 
My Koo Ka Choo 
Everything you do 
Going down in history 
She was out here for the summer 
All alone and I could tell you needed a man 
She said her nights were so lonely 
And I just told her that I understand 
I look at you, You look at me 
We can't deny, It's destiny 
Always remember the summer with me 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I am crazy for you 
Girl you put a spell on me 
My Koo Ka Choo 
Everything you do 
Going down in history 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I'll tell what I'll do 
Take you just a little bit higher 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I'm standing next to you 
Baby can you feel my fire 
She's a mystery 
That girl's a fantasy 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I am crazy for you 
Girl you put a spell on me 
My Koo Ka Choo 
Everything you do 
Going down in history 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I'll tell what I'll do 
Take you just a little bit higher 
My Koo Ka Choo 
I'm standing next to you 
Baby can you feel my fire
