GIVE A LITTLE

Long time ago
Knew a sweet little lassy
Hair like fire
And a walk kinda sassy
She had ruby lips
And sleazy eyes
Jungle hips
And Lucy Lucy thighs

Chorus
Baby baby take my hand
Baby baby understand
Give a little love 2 your baby
Give a little love 2 your man

She had a reputation
And a cruel smile
Give her an inch and she'll take a mile
Holy waters only make believe
Betty Boop what u doing to me

Chorus

Now I'm driving all night
In a limousine
She's showing me things I've never seen
There's a place in the world 4 a woman like u
Doing all the things that u getta do

Chorus
