DREAMTIME

If I ever thought my whole world be torn apart
If I ever dreamed I was the lucky one
I wanna touch you, wanna reach you
It's stormin' all the time
The lonely one's alone again

There's no daylight comin'
Where did it go
Where did it go
And it seems
Seems like a hundred miles away

And the stars above
Are shining for real love
And the sun is coming through
For dreamtime

If I could've fixed it
Stormin' all the time
Used to be the king of the world
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout that little girl
And the hardest part
How many words that you can't say
But you would though
If you could go
Back again
Yeah

Now you're gone
How can anyone be so wrong
But it hurts too much

I'm just a lonely boy
For your touch

And the stars above
Are shining for real love
And the sun is coming through
For dreamtime

Now you're gone
How can anyone be so wrong
That it hurts too much
I'm just a lonely boy
For your touch

And the stars above
Are shining for real love
And the sun is coming through
For dreamtime

It's coming through
For dreamtime
It's coming through
For dreamtime
Dreamtime
