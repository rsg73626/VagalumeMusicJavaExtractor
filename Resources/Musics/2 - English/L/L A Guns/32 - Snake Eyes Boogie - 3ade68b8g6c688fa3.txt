SNAKE EYES BOOGIE

Fire bomb Sally shook my goose 
Old one-eyed Jack cut me loose 
I've dot southern moonshine in my veins 
I'm gonna break that bank again 
Jokers, jacks, queens of hearts 
Fortune lies within these cards 
Stakes are high, theres much to win 
Reckless pleasure ain't a sin 
So I blow the dice and make a wish 
Dame luck made no promises 
I roll 'em good, I roll 'em fast 
This Irish luck is gonna last 
They'd all like to see me dead 
But I just stayed one step ahead 
Three bad sixes and a four 
And I'll be off this killing floor 
Shake, rock and roll 'em baby 
Roll those dice 
Shake, rock and roll 'em baby 
Snake eyes make me shake 
The devil, he's a gentleman 
We cut a deal in old Japan 
A thousand sobs on the red 
And take a bottle up to bed 
The odds are good I make a break 
Don't look back or hesitate 
Three bad sixes and a four 
And I'll be off this killing floor 
Shake, rock and roll 'em baby 
Roll those dice 
Shake, rock and roll 'em baby 
Snake eyes make me shake
