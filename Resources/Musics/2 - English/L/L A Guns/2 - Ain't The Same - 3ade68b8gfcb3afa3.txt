AIN'T THE SAME

Hey Baby, baby, you drive me crazy 
I'm gonna leave you one more time 
Don't try to stop me 
Don't say you love me 
I've gotta have my way this time 
If I try hard enough 
I'll live without your love 
This time it's plain to see 
That it's no good for you 
It's no good for me 
It just ain't the same without you 
Now these nights are so long 
It just ain't the same without you 
Now I know I was wrong 
I'm so sorry 
I must have been crazy 
How could I leave this love behind 
I'm so lonely 
Just like you told me 
Take me back just one more time 
It just ain't the same without you 
Now these nights are so long 
It just ain't the same without you 
Now I know I was wrong
