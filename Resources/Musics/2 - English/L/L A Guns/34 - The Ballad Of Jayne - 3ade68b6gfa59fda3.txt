THE BALLAD OF JAYNE

The Ballad Of Jayne
 
She was always something special
A diamond shining bright in the rain
everybody dreams of angels
No one will ever know how much I loved ya so

Now it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What happened to Jayne

U were always on my mind
A childlike summer days in the sun
Slowly wishes turn to sadness
Time don't heal a broken gun
I wish I'd never let u go
Hear me now cause I want ya to know

Now it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What happened to Jayne

Now she's breakin' hearts in heaven
Shining bright in the sky
I still hear her voice in the wind
I still think of u in the night
Well I guess she'll never know
How much I need her so

Now it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What happened to Jayne
