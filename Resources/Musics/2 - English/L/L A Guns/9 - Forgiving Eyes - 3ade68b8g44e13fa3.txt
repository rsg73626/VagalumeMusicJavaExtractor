FORGIVING EYES

Waiting for the day to raise itself
Some say it comes sulight so shine
I believe some evil some steal
Some make their hell
Denying who is real
I live, I breathe
Same breath I scream
On an even keel
Bring on, bring on Genesis
Lay it on, lay it on Genesis
Bring on, bring on Genesis
Lay it on, lay it on Genesis

'Cause you got all forgiving eyes
Man of stars, forgiver of lies
God bless forgiving eyes
The deceiver of fools was born a lie
Waiting for the day to save myself
It doesn't seem to come
Dark black I'm dyed
I have a good friend
I'm beginning to know

One more time
My redeeming ever glow
Bring on, bring on evil
Laying out, laying down evil
So bring it on, bring it on evil
Laying out, laying out evil
You got all forgiving eyes
Man of stars, forgiver of lies
God bless forgiving eyes
Deceiver of fools, born a lie
Gothic eyes, red-blood lies
Conceiver of fools
Conspiracy, temptation eyes
Patience, strength to decide
Whoa, oh forgiving eyes
Whoa, oh don't let me die
Whoa, oh forgiving eyes
Whoa, oh don't let me die
Can't you hear me
Can you hear me, I'm calling
Can you hear me, I'm calling
Don't let me die
