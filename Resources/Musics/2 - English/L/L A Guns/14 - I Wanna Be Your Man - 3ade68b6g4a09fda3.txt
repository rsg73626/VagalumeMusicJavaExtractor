I WANNA BE YOUR MAN

See me coming down the road
I'm coming down for you
Standing by the end of the line
What you gonna do

Intuition can't you see
Mistreat or got the shake on me
Fire and water rollin' dice
I'm gonna get you
No matter the price

I'm a hard man fight
I'm an easy man to please
Baby don't you mess with me
'Cause you couldn't take the heat

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your lover baby
I wanna be your man

No complication let me explain
I'll take you higher than an airplane
Look in the mirror, what I see
I see the devil and he's looking at me

I'm a hard man fight
I'm an easy man to please
Baby don't you mess with me
'Cause you couldn't take the heat

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your lover baby
I wanna be your man

Come here, come on

Come on baby take a chance
I'm a rock 'n' roll [Incomprehensible] on a single base
Fire and water rollin' dice
And now I've got you
Oh it's so nice

I'm a hard man fight
I'm an easy man to please
Baby don't you mess with me
'Cause you couldn't take
You couldn't take the heat

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man

That's right
