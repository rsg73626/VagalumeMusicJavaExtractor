SHOWDOWN (RIOT ON SUNSET)

Street fight
Black night
Heads are gonna roll
Sleazy bar
Stolen car
Where u need 2 go

Evil see as evil man do
And the walls come down
But u never letting go
Gonna stand your ground

Chorus
Showdown Riot On Sunset
Showdown we're coming ready or not
Gonna give u all that we got

Love sucks
Pick up truck
and a bottle of rye
Fighting Talk
Pussies walk
Another suicide

Here comes Jodie with a MIG
And a heart of stone
She's gonna blow u away
From the combat zone

Chorus
