HOLLYWOOD'S BURNING

If I wanted to, would you let me do
All kinds of crazy things to you
When I wanna fly, way up in the sky
Will you be my guide, will you

Everybody gets a little crazy

Hollywood's burnin' house by house
Goin' down in flames, can't put it out
Hollywood's burnin' mile by mile
Can't put it out, burnin' down in style

And through burning flames
I will call your name
We'll watch it burn from way up high
From the ashes rise, be my alibi
We take back the night

Hollywood's burning
Hollywood's burning
