17 CRASH

I groove in stereo
She make the moves
I love the nasty girls
How 'bout them shoes
You are so pretty girl
I love ya thighs
Take a trip in my Cadillac
2 the wild side

17 Crash chaos all around me
17 Crash hot sticky sweet
17 crash burnin' the house down
17
 

You're coming back with me
Don't say a word
Fire's burning down below
Ice in my blood
I ain't no Romeo
No daddy sweet
Just a bit of rock n' roll
Found on the street

17 Crash chaos all around me
17 Crash hot sticky sweet
17 

I bet u 10 2 1
Cause I fix the race
Put it down 2 xperience
A different kinda taste
O my pretty 1
Don't look so sad
Drink 2 me occasionally
And all the fun we had

17 Crash chaos all around me
17 Crash hot sticky sweet
17
