WILD OBSESSION

With your long black hair 
Fallin' down your face 
Red lips and lethal pout 
Send me to heaven 
Seein' is believin' 
Baby, you're so strange 
Something about you makes me sweat 
When I call your name 
Oh oh oh oh 
Goin' nowhere 
Oh oh oh oh 
Gettin' further out of control 
Wild Obsession - in the heat of the night 
Wild Obsession - and baby you know it ain't right 
She's got the sun and the moon in a velvet glove 
Showers of diamonds fall from high above 
She's a vicious queen 
She's a little girl 
I know she's a cornerstone of the underworld 
Oh oh oh oh 
Goin' nowhere 
Oh oh oh oh 
Gettin' further out of control 
Wild Obsession - in the heat of the night 
Wild Obsession - and we both know it ain't right 
Wild Obsession - runnin' beneath the neon stars 
Wild Obsession - Tearin' us all apart 
Oh oh oh oh 
Goin' nowhere 
Oh oh oh oh 
Gettin' further out of control 
Wild Obsession - in the heat of the night 
Wild Obsession - and we both know it ain't right 
Wild Obsession 
Wild Obsession - Tearin' us all apart
