I NEED IT (I’LL MISS YOU)

I need it (I’ll miss you)
Composição: Indisponível

(Verse 1)
You’re messing with my life
You’re messing with my head
The tattoo close of your ass is killing me

You’re not cloying for me
You’re not cloying for no one
Your way to walk on street mess with everybody

(Bridge)
Sometimes I think you let me in a bad way
Sometimes I think I’m fine with you
I know my mind is confused 
I think I’m going crazy

(Chorus)
I need stay by myself
I need stay alone for a minute
I need you stay far away from me during any time
I need you go away
I need you let a think about myself
I need you take a bus and go to another place, far away from me.

(Verse 2)
I didn’t fall in love for you
I didn’t make any mistake to have it
I really don’t know if I get to live with it with me

I know you’re really interesting
I know how your behavior on bed is
I always have inside of my heart and on my mind

(Bridge)
Sometimes I think you let me in a bad way
Sometimes I think I’m fine with you
I know my mind is confused 
I think I’m going crazy

(Chorus)
I need stay by myself
I need stay alone for a minute
I need you stay far away from me during any time
I need you go away
I need you let a think about myself
I need you take a bus and go to another place, far away from me.

I am asking for you with all the respect I have for you
You can shout for everybody hear how I am being fool with you
But there’s no another way to I say it for you
I’m sorry.
I’ll really miss you.

(Chorus)
I need stay by myself
I need stay alone for a minute
I need you stay far away from me during any time
I need you go away
I need you let a think about myself
I need you take a bus and go to another place, far away from me

I need stay by myself
I need stay alone for a minute
I need you stay far away from me during any time
I need you go away
I need you let a think about myself
I need you take a bus and go to another place, far away from me.

I need it.
I need only it.
