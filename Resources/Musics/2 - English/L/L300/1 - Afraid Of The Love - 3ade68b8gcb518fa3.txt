AFRAID OF THE LOVE

Afraid Of The Love
Composição: Indisponível

(Verse 1)	
Let’s go for other place
I wanna see your face
Don’t wanna be in a race
Don’t run away from me

I am a nice guy
But you don’t know why
But I can tell you
If you give me a time

(Bridge)
I am not afraid because my time is UP!!!

(Chorus)
I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid
Afraid of the love

I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid 
Afraid of the love

Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Afraid of the love

(Verse 2)
You are inside my heart
If you go out it'll stay hurt
I don’t know what to make
I am going crazy

I cannot more hear
You’re stuck to my head
Everything is so confusing
I am getting crazy about you

(Bridge)
I am not afraid because my time is UP!!!
I am not afraid of ANYTHING!!!

(Chorus)
I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid
Afraid of the love

I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid 
Afraid of the love

How everything changed so quickly?
Before I did not know who you were
I did not know who I was to speak the truth...

It’s so difficult to have everything
No one ever told me
I really did not know of nothing this is the purest truth…

(Chorus)
I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid
Afraid of the love

I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid 
Afraid of the love

I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid
Afraid of the love

I am not afraid
You are so afraid
We cannot be afraid 
Afraid of the love

Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Afraid of the love

Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Afraid of the love
