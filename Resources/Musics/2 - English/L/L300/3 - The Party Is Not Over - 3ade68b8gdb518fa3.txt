THE PARTY IS NOT OVER

The party is not over
Composição: Indisponível

(Verse 1)
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who is going away?

From
From
From
From my party

Doesn’t
Doesn’t
Doesn’t
Doesn’t he know?

That
That
That
This is a part

(Bridge)
Of all…
I have!
Of all…
I got!
It doesn’t…
Is right!
I’ll change that
I’ll change

(Chorus)
Get back here and say me why you are going away?
(Hey, hey, hey, why you are going away?)
Get back, sit on a chair and wait the party end
(Hey, hey, hey, wait the party end)
There’s so much girls dancing inside of house
(Hey, hey, hey, inside of house)
I don’t wanna see anybody going away
The time is not up.
The party is not over.

(Verse 2)
Hey…
Hey…
Hey…
Hey guy, get back

You…
You…
You…
You can’t go away now.

I…
I…
I…
I won’t let it happen


Turn…
Turn…
Turn…
Back and sit down.

(Bridge)
Are you…
Afraid of me?
Are you
Afraid of all?
It doesn’t…
Is right!
I’ll change that
I’ll change

(Chorus)
Get back here and say me why you are going away?
(Hey, hey, hey, why you are going away?)
Get back, sit on a chair and wait the party end
(Hey, hey, hey, wait the party end)
There’s so much girls dancing inside of house
(Hey, hey, hey, inside of house)
I don’t wanna see anybody going away
The time is not up.
The party is not over.

You can say that I am keeping you in a prison
Because I really am (‘cause I really am)
Everyone is enjoying the party
But you are not (I don’t know why)

I call many people for the party
And they’ll stay till the end (Till the end)
Why do you want to go away…?

Are your mom and your dad waiting for you?
Are they sat on the sofa?

Wake up to the life
You are not more a boy…
You grew up.
You grew up.

(Chorus)
Get back here and say me why you are going away?
(Hey, hey, hey, why you are going away?)
Get back, sit on a chair and wait the party end
(Hey, hey, hey, wait the party end)
There’s so much girls dancing inside of house
(Hey, hey, hey, inside of house)
I don’t wanna see anybody going away
I don’t wanna see anybody going away…

Get back here and say me why you are going away?
(Hey, hey, hey, why you are going away?)
Get back, sit on a chair and wait the party end
(Hey, hey, hey, wait the party end)
There’s so much girls dancing inside of house
(Hey, hey, hey, inside of house)
I don’t wanna see anybody going away
The time is not up.
The party is not O-VER!
