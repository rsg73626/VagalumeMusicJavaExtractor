SOME BELIEVE

To hear the swallows roosting beneath me
And watch the moonlight trickling by
I come down to the bridge when I'm troubled
Ohi and I'm troubled tonight

'Cause I was tucking my girl in at bedtime
As I got up she grabbed on my arm
She asked about the underground silos
And who are the people they'll harm
I told her...

Some believe the final fight
Will be won with greatest might
But weapons aren't what make us strong
I believe that they are wrong

So I'll raise my voice up high and clear
Let them know that I am here
For if we don’t stand and fight
I believe that they'll be right

Well it's more like a shame than a hopelessness
That I feel on the bridge at this hour
We feed this shadow of fear with our silence
Until it's intoxicated with power

For regardless of whether the warheads
Ever release in our skies
They are killing our kinship of nations
And the hope in our children's eyes

Some believe the final fight
Will be won with greatest might
But weapons aren't what make us strong
I believe that they are wrong

So I'll raise my voice up high and clear
Let them know that I am here
For if we don’t stand and fight
I believe that they'll be right

And as I watch the Big Dipper pour blackness
Down over the field's fading light
My daughter reminds me that the morning sun
Will rise up through the darkest of nights

Though our governments tell us we're different
My heart knows we're one and the same
The sun warms their wheat fields in Kansas
Just like my beloved Ukraine

Some believe the final fight
Will be won with greatest might
But weapons aren't what make us strong
I believe that they are wrong

So I'll raise my voice up high and clear
Let them know that I am here
For if we don’t stand and fight
I believe that they'll be right
