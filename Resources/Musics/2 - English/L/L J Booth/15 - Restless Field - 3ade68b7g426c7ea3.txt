RESTLESS FIELD

Out in a clover field
Through each moon rising
There is a sapling tree
Improvising
The wind pulls like a thief
At every trembling leaf

Love take me now
Come hold me now
And carry me
Over this restless field

Love take me now
Move through me now
And raise me up
Over this restless field

Beneath the moon's full face
That field...a lace gown
I spread a blanket out
You let your hair down
The wind pulled like a thief
At every trembling leaf

Love take me now
Come hold me now
And carry me
Over this restless field

Love take me now
Move through me now
And raise me up
Over this restless field

In time, that Maple tree
That grows between us
May run a springtime sap that 
Recalls this sweetness
And high above the ground
Will spread that moonlit crown

Love take me now
Come hold me now
And carry me
Over this restless field

Love take me now
Move through me now
And raise me up
Over this restless field
