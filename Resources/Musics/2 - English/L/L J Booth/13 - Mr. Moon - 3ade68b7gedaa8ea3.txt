MR. MOON

Up there in St Mathew’s belfry
There’s bats slipping out for the night
It’s black as a funeral tuxedo
With one button shining out bright
(Old moon in his ivory light)

Tonight when you cleared the horizon
And rose with such ease
Through the tangle of trees
I heard some silent tune...Mr Moon

If you can tug on the oceans
And waver the depths of ihe sea
And if most of my body is water
Then how much are you pulling me?
(What’s in your beams I can’t see?)

‘Cause down ‘neath the hulls in the harbor
There’s a feeling inside
Like a warm rising tide
And some soft ancient tune...Mr Moon

Let’s ask the hands of the hungry
We’ll question the needy and cursed
Just how many billion that they would have spent
So now we can say we were first
(My country loves to be first)

But I’ll bet you’re glad we stopped coming
To silently spin
Through the heavens again
And humm that ancient tune...Mr Moon
