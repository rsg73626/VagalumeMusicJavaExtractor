AKASHA WIND

There's something moving out tonight
It sifted through the trees and the last horizon light
Down where the creek flows through the fence
You can hear it singing in the wire

Singing...oh oh Akasha Wind
oh oh Akasha Wind

Hear the rustling in the trees
Its thumbing through the documents
As it passes down the ridge
What it finds it leaves no clue
'Cept for a whistling in the flue

Singing...oh oh Akasha Wind
oh oh Akasha Wind

Some say there's hands on the night wind
That are reading the forest like braille
And every tree is a library,
'cause every line of every leaf tells a tale

There is no scholar like the wind
It touches everything it passes
And circles around again
Reading history's relief
In every line of every leaf

Singing...oh oh Akasha Wind
oh oh Akasha Wind

From the whisper up high on the white pine
To the wires out along the fencerow
Is an ever unraveling story

'Cause it's reading out loud as it goes
There's something moving out tonight
It sifted through the trees and the last horizon light
Down where the creek flows through the fence
Oh you can hear it singing in the wire

Singing...oh oh Akasha Wind
oh oh Akasha Wind
