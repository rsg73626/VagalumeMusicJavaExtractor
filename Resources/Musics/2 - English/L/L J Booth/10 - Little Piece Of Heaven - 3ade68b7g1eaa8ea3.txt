LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN

I’m a good worker
I’m a hard worker
I seldom miss a day
I assemble all these pieces
Like I’d make them for myself
Though the boss man never has good words to say
And it hasn’t made a difference
In my take home pay

Still it gives me
This little piece of heaven
Here in my heart

I’ve got a blues harp
In my socks drawer
I play sometimes at night
No one’s heard me- no one needs to
It helps the lonely feel alright
And though I’ll never hear an encore
On an opening night
I’ll take my blues harp
My kitchen and candlelight

‘Cause it gives me
This little piece of heaven
Here in my heart

I see the advertisements
They tell me what I need
To be healthy, to be happy
To satisfy my greed
They’re just trying to make a living, I know
But there ain’t no way in hell
I’d trade my little piece of heaven
For the crazy things they sell

On the weekends
This apartment
really comes to life
It’s not parties
It’s not nightiife
It’s when I get my little girl
You’ve never seen a sparkler in July
Until you’ve seen one
Light up my little girl’s eyes

She gives me
This little piece of heaven
Here in my heart
Here in my heart
