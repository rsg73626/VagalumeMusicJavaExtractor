HYMN FOR THE LIVING

Fantail of a red-tailed hawk
Red-wing on a cattail stalk
Black crow in a trickling spring
Yes, it means everything
Lord knows, I'm a lucky man
To watch the view from where I stand

And I'm living in the light of your love

Sometimes I get feeling low
Spinning in my own shadow
But while I'm all caught up in me
You wait so patiently
To greet me with your morning song
And ask me, "John, what took so long?"

To be living in the light of you...
So proud to be a part of your...
Living in the light of your love

Joe says. 'There's no free lunch pass
You work like hell and watch your ass."
While he's talking suits and ties
His kids are catching fireflies
His daughter runs up, with a smile
Hands Joe the jar and for a while

He's all lit up by the light of their love
Living in the light of you
In spite of all he's going through
Living in the light of your love

Blossoms on an apple tree
It don't take no honey bee
To know those flowers 'cross the road
Are an olfactory overload
Not satisfied with looking great
They fill my lungs and fill my plate

And I'm living in the light of their love
Living in the light of you
In spite to all Iâ€™m going through
Living in the light of your love
