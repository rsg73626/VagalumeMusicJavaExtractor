MOONBEAM

Hello little moonbeam
Such a welcome sight
I've got nothing in my pockets
Walk with me tonight

Old cars in the tall grass
Broken glass and chrome
Down along the railway
Behind my parent's home

Hiding in the sumac
Waiting for a train
Got a penny on the railway

Hello little moonbeam
I forgot your song
Every crosstie tells me
I've been gone too long

Seems to me
That you give your light so freely
Won't you shed your beams on me
I need you, little moonbeam

When I was a young boy
Balanced on this rails
I'd hold my jacket high lord
Wind would fill my sail

Hello little moonbeam
Balanced on this rail
I'll hold my jacket high, lord
Wind come fill my sail

Hiding in the sumac
Waiting for a train
Got a penny on the railway
