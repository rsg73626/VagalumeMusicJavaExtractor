FASCINATION

I been out walking on the ridge tonight
Wondering what beats stronger
Locomotive engine or the hummingbirds heart

And tell me who's pushing all these needles of light
In through this huge pincushion of night
I wanna know
It's got my goat

It's the fascination
That's what I’m living for
Ain't nobody knows
Just how far it goes
Just how far it goes

Still we've got to hold on
Yeah, we're going to hold on
Still we've got to hold on
Every day

As I come out on the logging road
The night wind rises from below
And brings a sweet
Blossom on the breeze

In this darkness I could never say
What kind of tree or how far away
It's just sweet mystery

It's the fascination
That's what I’m living for
Ain't nobody knows
Just how far it goes
Just how far it goes

Still we've got to hold on
Yeah, we're going to hold on
Still we've got to hold on
Every day

Way up high at the big top show
The high wire walker knows
That gravity
Is a quick way to retire

But when they turn the house lights low
And he tests that lifeline with his toes
It's gravity
That holds him to the wire

It's the fascination
That's what I’m living for
Ain't nobody knows
Just how far it goes
Just how far it goes

Still we've got to hold on
Yeah, we're going to hold on
Still we've got to hold on
Every day
