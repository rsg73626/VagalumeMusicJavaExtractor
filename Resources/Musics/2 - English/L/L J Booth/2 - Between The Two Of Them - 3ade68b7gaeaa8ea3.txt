BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM

They married back in '32
They were young and love was new
And every day that feeling grew
Between the two of them

Work got scarce and times got bad
Hope would chase away the sad
Hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them

The forties came and the fifties went
Mortgage note replaced the rent
They made the most of each day spent
Between the two of them

The children all turned out fine
He retired in '69
Left with oh so little time
Between the two of them

Today I braved the graveyard rain
Placed a rose between their names
That's the most that ever came
Between the two of them

Though I miss them both so much
Her crooked smile, his gentle touch
The pleasure of just growing up
Between the two of them
