THE ECONOMY NEEDS A WAR

Ask any foreman or front office Joe
The nation’s production is moving too slow
The dollar has slipped to its lowest degree
The kingpins on Wall Street to this, they agree

The economy needs a war
That’s what they’re pulling for
There’s talk about fighting for freedom
But the bottom line reason
Is supply and demand are bored

We know you’re confused son. your mind needs a rest
So let us do your thinking; we’re America’s best
Just think, in a year you’ll be giving commands
You’ll know how to kill in six seconds
With Just your bare hands

The economy needs a war
That’s what we train them for
They think they’re fighting for freedom
But the bottom line reason
Is supply and demand once more

Just pick a small country, it’ll never be missed
Then fix it to look like they threw the first fist
Be sure and teach us they’re all communist rats
Before we kill them we hand them black hats

But I don’t care if he’s Russian
He’s a brother to me
You call them future communists
But they’re children to me
And I won’t fight for freedom
If it means killing family

But ask any foreman or white collar Joe
The nation’s production is moving too slow
The dollar has slipped to its lowest degree
The fat cats on Wall Street, to this, they agree

The economy needs a war
That’s what they’re pulling for
You’ll see flags waving tor freedom
But you best not believe them
It’s supply and demand
That big greedy hand wants more

Well, it took me a long time
To fish out this straight line
But I won’t fight for your
Dirty war
