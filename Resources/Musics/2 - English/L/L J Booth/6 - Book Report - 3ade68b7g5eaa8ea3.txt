BOOK REPORT

Just before our recess time
Becky Lane tapped me from behind
And slipped this little note in my hand
Next thing I hear is that call
Young man, meet me out in the hall
And now I've got to write this book report

It's never bothered me more than a touch
To get kicked out in the hall this much
Usually there's somebody else out here from some other class
We'll slide down the hall to the kitchen
And see what type of cookie they're fixin'
Buti what am I gonna do
About this damn book report?

I'd rather give Amy Banks a look
Than read what someone says pretty is in some book
That library's so quiet, you'd think the librarian died
I imagine she'd probably get shook
If I used comics instead of a book
Oh, what am I gonna do
About this damn book report?

Maybe I'll build me a time machine
To take me back to the Pleistocene
If other kids wanna come, I'm sure we could build more
We' l watch as each century passes
I hope I remember my glasses
I'd sure hate to have to squint
At a dinosaur

Maybe then I'll play like a wild west Tex
And I'll lasso a Tyrannosaurs Rex
And bring him back in my time machine to class
Well he'd have to get his jaws pretty wide
But maybe he'd eat Miss MacBride
Then I wouldn't have to write
This book report

Just before our recess time
Becky Lane tapped me from behind
And slipped this little note in my hand...
