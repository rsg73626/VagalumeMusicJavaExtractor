NINE MONTHS OF DISTANCE AN ODOMETER CAN'T READ

This morning I held the meaning between these calloused paws.
The honesty of it all. 
This morning I woke up healing, humbled by what I saw. 
The honesty of it all. 

Words are the walls not what they hold inside 
bend around the structure, lean behind cotton masks 
holding babies who will never see it all with such little eyes never close them, let them soar and burn and tear until 

This morning I held the meaning between these calloused paws.
The honesty of it all. 
This morning I woke up healing, humbled by what I saw. 
The honesty of it all. 

That tired fear ticking too fast to realize, 
Just try to catch your breath keep dancing with the pulse rise. 
Language is far too weak, sloppy, and thin 
the music is good todd but it will never be as real as this 
So vulnerable. So innocent. So human.

This morning I held todds baby, between theses calloused paws, 
The honesty of it all.
