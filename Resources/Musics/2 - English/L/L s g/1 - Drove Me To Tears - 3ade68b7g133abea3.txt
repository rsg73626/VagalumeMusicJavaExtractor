DROVE ME TO TEARS

How could you leave
How could you go
I've told you I changed
And baby, you know

You know that I can't live without your love, no
How could you laugh and tell your friends
That you'll be cool if you don't see me again
You got me all messed up, yeah

Grown men shouldn't cry
But no matter how hard I try
I can't stop these tears
From falling from my eyes

1 - Baby, you drove me to tears
Because I can't have you here
Baby I ain't cried in years
I need you here
I need you near

Baby, you drove me to tears
Because I can't have you here
Baby, I ain't cried in years
I need you here
I need you near

What can I do
To make you see
That I can be all you want me to be
You see I'm gonna get ya back, yes I am

Whatever it is you don't like
I'll do my best to make it right
To put us on the right track, oh yeah, babe
I know grown men shouldn't cry
But no matter how hard I try
I can't stop the tears
From falling from my eyes

Repeat 1 until
