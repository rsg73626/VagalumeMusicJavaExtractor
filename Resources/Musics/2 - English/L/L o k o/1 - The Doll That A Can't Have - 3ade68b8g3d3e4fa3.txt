THE DOLL THAT A CAN'T HAVE

Anny in m heart you here
You can change my life
And make me feel
A big father
I never forget you { parte 1 (leon) }
For good tme that make
Pass for happy days
Your mon and i your dad


Now i cry
Because you dont here now
In my side 2x
Why god get you for me

I dont understand
You die young
The doll that i cnat have you is { refrao ( dueto) }
The doll that i cnat have you is

[ primeira parte ]

I dont understand
You die yong
All .... all days
I dream of day that you birh
My daugther .... my daugther ....
