BEHIND THE LIGHT

I have a gift for you tonight,
more pressures then to go,
much more than these lines are write,
before it's getting cold.

Without you i am nothing,
and nothing i will be,
but there is just that one thing,
i want you to see.

I show you the world,
the world behind the light,
i take you there,
i take you there tonight.

Since the day i saw you,
you walked into the drew,
i knew my dreams had come true,
i knew you'd be my due,
i tried so hard to make you see,
that i'm the one for you,
the one who it is who will be your love,
for eternity.

Without you i am nothing,
and nothing i will be,
but there is just that one thing,
i want you to see.

I show you the world,
the world behind the light,
i take you there,
i take you there tonight.

I show you the world,
the world behind the light,
i take you there,
i take you there.

We went to be together,
i know that you agree,
i'm dying here tonight,
and i'll take you with me.

I show you the world,
the world behind the light,
i take you there,
i take you there tonight.
