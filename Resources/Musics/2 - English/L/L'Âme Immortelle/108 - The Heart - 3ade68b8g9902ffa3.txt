THE HEART

My heart was never made of marble
I do not have what it demands
To watch my life just flowing by
Like sand flows thru my hands

There'll be nothing left
No more love and no more tears
My heart will turn to stone
Nothing left but tainted years

I can't recount how often
My heart was dragged thru hell
But why give it to anyone?
I cannot say as well

My heart was never made of stone
I bear it open
Wide and clear

I cannot mute my hearts calling
As it starts bleeding with your name

My heart was never made of stone
I bear it open
Wide and clear
And pieces of it will be broken

As they disappear

All I can do is live on
It will always stay the same
I cannot mute my hearts calling
It starts bleeding with your name
