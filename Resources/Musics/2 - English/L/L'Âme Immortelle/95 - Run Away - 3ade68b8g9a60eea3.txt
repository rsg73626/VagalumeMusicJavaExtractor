RUN AWAY

Lying weeping on the floor
Like so many times before
As the ice is getting thin
Walls come closing in
I cannot take it anymore
Like so many times before
My soul a war-torn battlefield
With bridges burned and portals sealed

I can never run away
From the war inside of me
I can never turn away
From this bleeding words I say

I travelled endless miles and more
To flee from who I was before
Through deepest pain and agony
To be somebody else but me
The pain I suffered in the past
Made me what I am at last
But all that I've overcome
Made me who I have become

I can never run away
From the war inside of me
I can never turn away
From this bleeding words I say

We are just what we've become
We can't make what we did undone
But we can change who we will be
In everybody's memory
