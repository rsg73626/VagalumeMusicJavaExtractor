REBORN

I am alone
With the banners I have flown
Inside
A man who's stripped of all his pride

On darkened shores I was stranded
All my shelters I abandoned
The sun of truth has struck me blind
A crying soul, left behind

I have lived and I will die
By the oath that I have sworn
My flames will lighten up the sky
And I will reborn

My eyes can see
The shadows of a memory
Inside
A lonely child who's been denied

The emptiness of summer's gone
The thin black line that I have drawn
My love and hate, in one combined
Define the one, who's left behind
