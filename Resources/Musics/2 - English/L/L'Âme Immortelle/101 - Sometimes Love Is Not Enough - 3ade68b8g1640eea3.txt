SOMETIMES LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH

It's our past that holds us captive
That made us who we are
That blinds us when we have to see
Beyond every scar
It is you who wants to hold me
Until the end of time
Hold me so hard I cannot breathe
But our words don't rhyme

Sometimes love is not enough

Your love just makes me colder
Although I want to feel
The fire that I gave to you
Hoping it would heal
The bleeding wound deep in me
The emptiness inside
To unveil the buried love
That I try to hide

Sometimes love is not enough

We are still so different
Love doesn't conquer all
If we want to fly together
We are damned to fall
