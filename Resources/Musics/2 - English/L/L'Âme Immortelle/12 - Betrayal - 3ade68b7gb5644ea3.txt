BETRAYAL

In these moments when I think of you
And suicide seems the way of choice
I think of your betrayal
Which still echoes with your voice

I gave you all that I could give
My soul, my heart, my mind
And I didn`t see the future coming
Because I`ve been too blind

Tell me: Why did you betray me?
Why did you do the thinks you`ve done?
Tell me: Why did you betray me?
Destroyed my life with so much fun

You took all that you could get from me
Until the final day
My pride, my light, my energy
My sight to see my way

You left me empty on the floor
Without even looking back
And then you walked through the door
And my life turned black
