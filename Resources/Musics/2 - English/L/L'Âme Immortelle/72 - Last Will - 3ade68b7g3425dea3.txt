LAST WILL

Is this the end of the road
We travelled for so many years
Of my life's best journey
Full of joy and tears
is this the end of the summer
To pave my winter's way
The end of all salvation
In the words I say

Let my songs tell them my story
When the final chapter's done
Songs of love, defeat and glory
Sound on when I am gone

Are these the ways of destiny
To tell me I was wrong
The painfull thruth of fortide
That carried me along
Are these the ways of life itself
That I had to master
The trials of the gods above
That led to this disaster

Let my songs tell them my story
When the final chapter's done
Songs of love, defeat and glory
Sound on when I am gone

How could i believe
That this would last forever
All that gave my soul relief
