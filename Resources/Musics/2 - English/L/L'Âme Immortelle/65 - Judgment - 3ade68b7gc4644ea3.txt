JUDGMENT

Standing still here for a moment 
Breath held tightly in my body 
A world that´s growing darker 
Not worth a longer stay 

All the wisdom that I earned 
Can´t make a change to this state 
As I lay down my spirit´s arms 
On my knees to seal my fate 

I cast my hopes into the waters 
Awaiting judgement from the sea 
And someday the tide will rise 
Up so high to swallow me 

Collapsing pride and fading joy 
Are marking my capitulation 
To a world that cries in pain 
And slowly dies in misery 

Come the demons of my soul 
To carry my sane mind away 
I´m just a noble soul of honour 
Who has left its way
