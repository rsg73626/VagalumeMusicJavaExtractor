VOICELESS

I watch the stars collapse at night 
When demons haunt me once again 
In the sky, their death shines bright 
Every loss brings a new gain 

The peace of voiceless darkness 
Silence voices who scream at me 
And through the gentle night- time 
I gain the knowledge, that I´m free 

When you´re in your darkest hours 
Seek the embrace of the night 
Open up to all its powers
I`ll show you what`s behind the light

We`re blinded by the brightest shining 
And see not what`s behind 
So we watch our own declining
Life, that made us far too blind

We will not see the pleasures offered 
When they´re not obvious to see 
Beauty´s just what they will look at
Close the door and drop the key
