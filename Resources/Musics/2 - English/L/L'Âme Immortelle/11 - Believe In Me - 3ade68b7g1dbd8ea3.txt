BELIEVE IN ME

Believe In Me

My dedication for the cause
And the wishes I’ve withdrawn
Blessed me with nothing but the blame
For friendships lost and virtues gone

My loyalty and honesty
Held nothing but decay
Blessed me with nothing but the blame
If we had lost our way

Why don’t you believe in me
Despite the battles we have won?
Why still sacrifice myself
I have no strength to carry on

The invidia of those surrounding
Forges doubts in what I do
And breaks the chains that years have tied
After all that we’ve been through
