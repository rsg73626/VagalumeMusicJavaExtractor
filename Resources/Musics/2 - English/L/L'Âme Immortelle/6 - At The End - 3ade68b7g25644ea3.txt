AT THE END

Trodden paths they seem outdated
To many reasons I have stated
The path divides I have to decide
A new life, a new way to stride.

Hollow eyes are watching me
Tell me which way to go
Do not believe the fading footsteps
In this winter`s snow.

Hear the thunder coming down
Dreams of forbidden lands, where I do drown
Here at the hilltop, proud I stand
A new beginning at the end

Trees that have seen many ages
I hear them speak to me
Moving forward, hide away
The consequence is hard to see.

Reflecting 'bout what might be
A life of lust, and restlessness
Or full of love and warm retreat
The goods I currently posses
