THE BEAST

Enemies lie waiting
Like vultures for their prey
While I am this weak
Waiting for decay

With greedy eyes they stare at me
Longing for my soul
With hollow lies they care for me
Just to gain control

I praise the dark inside of me
Unleash the beast and set it free
To take revenge for what they've done
To crush their souls, to rule as one

With open eyes, come stare at me
And turn away in fear
Your hollow lies will stay with me
Echoing each year

I praise the dark inside of me
Unleash the beast and set it free
To take revenge for what they've done
To crush their souls, to rule as one
