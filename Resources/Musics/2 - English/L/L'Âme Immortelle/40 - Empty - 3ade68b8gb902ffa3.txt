EMPTY

There have been days where I thought
The world revolves around me
There have been days where I thought
I outrun my destiny

But in my heart I will be broken
Empty deep inside

There have been days where I thought
I am not tainted and small
There have been days where I thought
Life's not hard, life's not hard at all

But in my heart I will be broken
Empty deep inside
No matter, no matter what's been spoken
Across our great divide

There have been days where I thought
It can't rain forever
There have been days where I thought
No, never say never

There have been days where I thought
Life is not just war
There have been days where I thought
Life is so much more

It can't rain forever
No, never say never
Life is not just war
Life is so much more
