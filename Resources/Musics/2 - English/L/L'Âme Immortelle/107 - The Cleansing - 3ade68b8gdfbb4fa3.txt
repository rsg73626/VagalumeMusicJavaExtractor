THE CLEANSING

Like a ship on untamed oceans
I’m lost without a trace
Clouds in their gentle motions
Mock me with their grace

And I watch the fading sunset
As the waves come crashing in
I hope the sea will cleanse me
From the pain within

In seas of sin, I lost my soul
Never to be found
A life astray, without control
Sinking to the ground

And I watch the fading sunset
As the waves come crashing in
I hope the sea will cleanse me
From the pain within

And on the next day’s morning
I shall be offered to the sea
To wash away my guilt forever
And end my misery
