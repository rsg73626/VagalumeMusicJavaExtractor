RESURRECTION

Feel the cage 
Let free the rage 
See the lies 
That surround us 

Feel the laws 
Let free your rage 
See the walls 
That do bind us 

Resurrect your soul from its forced sleep 
Resurrect your thoughts, that were silenced long ago 
Resurrect your love, from It's dense keep 
Resurrect your passion, unleash your will,  unleash your soul 

Break the chains 
Of all morality 
Unleash your will 
And you will see 

All you are 
All you can be 
All you are 
All that you will be 

Break the laws 
Of our society 
Unleash your will 
Be all you can be 

Resurrect your soul from its forced sleep 
Resurrect your thoughts, that were silenced long ago 
Resurrect your love, from It's dense keep 
Resurrect your passion, unleash your will, unleash your mind 

"Those who bear no doubts in their beliefs 
can become and achieve everything by 
the sheer power of their will. 
Once unleashed its force can only be tamed 
by death's seductive powers" 

All you are 
All you can be 
All you are 
All that you will be 

Resurrect your soul from its forced sleep 
Resurrect your thoughts, that were silenced long ago 
Resurrect your love, from It's dense keep 
Resurrect your passion, unleash your mind
