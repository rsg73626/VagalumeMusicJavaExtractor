WHEN THE SUN HAS CEASED TO SHINE

I've had a thousand faces
A fiction million smiles
I've walked the path of denial
For a thousand miles
I've kissed a thousand demons
I killed a hundred sheep
And there is no way out
Cause I'm in too deep

At the edge of my existence
At the peak of my decline
Only shadows drive me onward
When the sun has ceased to shine

I’ve seen a thousand mornings
I’ve lived a million nights.
I’ve walked within the shadows.
Beneath the city lights.
I‘ve fought a thousand battles
I’ve been in a hundred wars.
And I will always live on
Behind close doors

At the edge of my existence
At the peak of my decline
Only shadows drive me onward
When the sun has ceased to shine

I’ve killed myself a thousand times
But that didn’t kill the pain.
My live's a poem without rhymes
