REARRANGING

I´ve walked the holy grounds of justice 
For too long now, I assume 
I cleared the paths for those too week 
And walked blind into my doom 

The time has come to change the sight 
To find a new perspective 
To search the world for inner peace 
Leave shelters, so protective 

But in the end it all stays the same 
No changes made no lessons learned 

Seasons change as time goes by 
When tears are cried, they always dry 
A change be made, to understand 
That I will find my promised land 

I cared to much for people´s thoughts 
And forgot about my own 
If I´d continue to suit their needs 
I´d lose the treasure that I own 

My powers focused, they shall be 
To treat my treasure properly 
To conserve its beauty, and its love 
And never threat our unity
