DYING DAY

A lonely chord’s resounding
In the hallway of my soul
And a drum is slowly pounding
Out of my control 
Falling lonely through the ceiling
A water drop does find its way
Wounds that never will be healing
Scar me since that very day

There is nothing left to do but pray
The day you died I lost my way
You always cared and helped me see
Out of this misery

You`ve always been my shelter
Always been my guide
In joyful days of summer 
And in the days I cried

Now you’re gone and I’m still here
Lost and left behind
A new born visionary
Who has gone blind

There is nothing left to do but pray
The day you died I lost my way
You always cared and helped me see
Out of this misery
