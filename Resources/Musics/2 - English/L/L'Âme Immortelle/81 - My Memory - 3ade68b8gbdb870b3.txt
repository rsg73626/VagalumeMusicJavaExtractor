MY MEMORY

Pages blank, needing reason
Time has taken life away
Years of fighting, sin and treason
Will be turning into grey
Dim the lights and draw the curtains
Close the door and leave me be
All I have now in this moment
Is my memory

With my blood I write a poem
Into the morning sky
An effort taken just to show them
All the reasons why
Why I'm struck with solitude
With people at my side
Why I'm still lost, I conclude
Without you as my guide

Time has taken life away
Paint has dried on prison walls
My everlasting hideaway
In these cold and empty halls
This is all I have to say
