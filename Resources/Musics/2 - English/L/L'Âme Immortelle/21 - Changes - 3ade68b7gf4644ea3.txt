CHANGES

Another daybreak waking up
Drinking from a bitter cup
That's somehow sweet and oh so tender
This poison confirms my surrender

Surrendering to all day life
No more wars and no more strife
Stars upon a deep dark sky
I bow down and I ask why

But in the end it all stays the same
No changes made, no lessons learned
Am I the one who is to blame
For smashing crowns that I have earned

New possibilities each day
They offer me a different way
To live, to walk or just to be
Or lead me into misery

I am just as small as you
Although I do not want me to
With all the powers I posess
I'm just afraid of loneliness

Let me dream here of a freedom
That will never be my own
If I do not pay the prize
Of forever being alone
