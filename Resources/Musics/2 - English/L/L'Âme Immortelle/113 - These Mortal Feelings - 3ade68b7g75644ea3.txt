THESE MORTAL FEELINGS

All my life I wanted to be different from the prey
All my life I had absolutely nothing to say
But my mind grew up as time passed by
And so I realised that friendship is nothing but a lie

These Mortal feelings keep telling lies
And you're just too stupid to realise
The pain deep within my heart
Deep within my soul

I left my past behind me
Except for the things you did to me
Atrocities of a mental kind
Made me sick, they made me blind
