JUST A SHADOW

It's so cold
I can hardly breathe
It's so dark
My longing for release 

It's so pure
As I let go of everything
I'm so free, I'm so free
But this freedom's killing me

I keep screaming out your name
What have I become
A mere shadow of myself (just a shadow)
Fleeing from the sun

I'm so numb
I don't feel a thing
I'm so lost
In this burning suffering

But I stay, I stay empty
As I try to fill the void
It's just me, it's just me
Tumbling into misery
