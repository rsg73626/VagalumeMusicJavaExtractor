NEVER AGAIN

A tyranny of ignorance 
Shatterd all our pride 
A curse that is still present 
While the swords are laid aside 

The masses cheer and gather 
As the false prophets speak 
Of a new order, a new way 
To all those who changes seek 

Never again shall we be ruled 
By the demons of our past 
Never again shall we be conquered 
By the shadows that still last 

Have they learned nothing 
From our country's history 
Why don't they understand 
That they won't be free 

If they summon demons 
Who will bring them misery 
Are they marching into war 
Or are they just to blind to see 

But why are we held responsible 
For the crimes our fathers have commited? 
Why are we the ones who are to blame? 
Why do we have to bear the shame 
For what they have done, at the dawning of the sun?
