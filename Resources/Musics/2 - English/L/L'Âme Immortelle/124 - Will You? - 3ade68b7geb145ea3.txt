WILL YOU?

Like a vast landscape 
My soul lies open 
Is it the fear, is it your voice
That turned me mute 

Cries unheard 
For a time too long 
Is it the pain, is it your beauty 
That made me blind 

Will you ever desire me? 
Will you ever take me in your arms? 
Will you ever desire me? 
Will you ever feel the same I do? 

Although you´re so near to me 
You´re still so far away 
Although I´ve known you for such a long time
I´ve never met you before 

My lips they´ll be sealed 
Until I lay down into my grave 
Then the time, it has now come 
Where I do you no longer crave 

And then will you stand by my tomb 
Perhaps the only one who will 
I wish that you spell out my name 
When death has come my soul to tame
