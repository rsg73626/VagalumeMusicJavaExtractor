LAKE OF TEARS

My path into the shadows 
It seemed so well defined 
A labyrinth of darkness 
No joy for me to find 

The path that leads to you 
Is so hard for me to find 
And with every step I take 
I hope the gods are kind 

You took my doubts, you took my fears 
You led me through this lake of tears 
So close we are, but still apart 
Not in mine, but in your heart

You took my doubts, you took my fears 
You led me through this lake of tears 
So close we are, but still apart 
Not in mine, but in your heart 

Your warm and schizophrenic heart 
Still does not beat for me alone 
As it still bears rememberance 
Of feelings that I think are gone 

Every day I hope and pray 
For your love and sense 
That you will come into my arms 
And give our love a chance

You took my doubts, you took my fears 
You led me through this lake of tears 
So close we are, but still apart 
Not in mine, but in your heart

You took my doubts, you took my fears 
You led me through this lake of tears 
So close we are, but still apart 
Not in mine, but in your heart 

You took my doubts, you took my fears 
You led me through this lake of tears 
So close we are, but still apart 
Not in mine, but in your heart

Is there someone who can lead me
Out of this fate and to the light?
Is there someone who can guide me
Through the lake of tears I cry?

You took my doubts, you took my fears 
You led me through this lake of tears 
So close we are, but still apart
