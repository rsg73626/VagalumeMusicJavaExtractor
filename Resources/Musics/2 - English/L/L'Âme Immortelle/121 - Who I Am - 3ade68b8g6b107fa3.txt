WHO I AM

I was never what you wanted
Who you wanted me to be
I never walked the easy paths
That you laid down for me 

I've always been a dreamer
Who just wanted to see
That everything is possible
To make these dreams reality

All my hopes and all my fears
My dreams and visions, all the tears
All my demons I condemn
Make me up, that's who I am

I was never satisfied
With what I had achieved
I always reached up to the sky
For things I had believed 

I've always been impulsive
Always stood in my own way
Saw more in every spoken word
Than it could ever say

I am still what these lines say
But now I can admit
That I show no remorse
And I am proud of it
