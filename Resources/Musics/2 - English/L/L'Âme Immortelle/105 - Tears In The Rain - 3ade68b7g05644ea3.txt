TEARS IN THE RAIN

Hollow cries and fading faces
Searching all those empty places
Alone in pain, alone in fear
And rain washes away my final tear

The words I suffered in decay
Leave me no more room to stay
The things that you have said to me
Are washed away, along with my memory

We are all lost
Like tears in the rain
And the water from above
Kills the eternal flame

Dreams I've dreamed and wishes ceased
I feel the inner demon's pleased
The wheel keeps turning endlessly
I let the rain fall down on me

The gentle water flowing down
A collapsed soul that wants to drown
This was my kingdom, now it's lost
In the gentle rain, I trust
