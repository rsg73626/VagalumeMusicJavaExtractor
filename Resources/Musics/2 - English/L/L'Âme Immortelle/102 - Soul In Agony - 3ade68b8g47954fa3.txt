SOUL IN AGONY

The snow has nearly covered
Every aspect of my soul
And the rain has washed away
The whispers that i stole

Fallen, closed down and disbanded
I stay here gazing at the sky
And swallow, like i always did
The tears that i should cry

Have you come to tame
the raging storm inside of me ?
To mute the voices that keep screaming
words of lie and agony ?
(but...)

You created, You created me

The Darkness that is haunting me
Raping my reality
The raging storm inside of me, created me...
In agony

I used to smile every morning
When the sun opened my eyes
I used to believe in human nature
And in the absence of lies

I used to fall asleep safely
When the moon had closed my eyes
Until you stepped into my life
And turned the truth to lies

(that day i asked you:)

Have you come to tame
the raging storm inside of me ?
To mute the voices
that keep screaming words of lie and agony ?
(but...)
