ONE ETERNITY

Wilt thou go with me sweet maid
Say maiden wilt thou go with me
Through the valley depths of shade
Of night and dark obscurity


Where the path hath lost its way
Where the sun forgets the day
Where there's nor life nor light to see
Sweet maiden wilt thou go with me


Say maiden can thy life be led
To join the living with the dead
Then trace thy footsteps on with me
We're wed to one eternity


Say maiden wilt thou go with me
In this strange death of life to be
To live in death and be the same
Without this life or home or name


At once to be or not to be
That was and is not-yet to see
Things pass like shadows-and the sky
Above, below, around us lie.


Where stones will turn to flooding streams
Where plains will rise like ocean waves
Where life will fade like visioned dreams
And mountains darken into caves
Say maiden wilt thou go with me
Through this sad non-identity
Where parents live and are forgot
And sisters live and know us not
