HAVE I EVER?

Have I ever been in love? In love with you?
Have you ever been in love? In love with me?

Why is my memory still longing?
Is it longing for you?
Why is my heart never beating?
Is it still beating for you?

As time has passed
Nothing has changed
As tides have turned
I'm still the same

As time has passed
Nothing has changed
And I am still the same

Have I ever been in love? In love with you?
Have you ever been in love? In love with me?

I believe in you, you believe in me
And as times do pass, the gods agree
I'm in love with you, you're in love with me
But you're just too blind to see

Why am I still breathing?
Am I breathing because of you?
Why is my pain never ceasing?
This is, this is because of you

Have I ever been in love? In love with you?
Have you ever been in love? In love with me?

I believe in you, you believe in me
And as times do pass, the gods agree
I'm in love with you, you're in love with me
But you're just too blind to see

Have I ever been in love? In love with you?
Have you ever been in love? In love with me?

Have I ever been in love? In love with you?
Have you ever been in love? In love with me?

Have I ever been in love? In love with you?
Have you ever been in love? In love with me?

I believe in you, you believe in me
And as times do pass, the gods agree
I'm in love with you, you're in love with me
But you're just too blind to see
