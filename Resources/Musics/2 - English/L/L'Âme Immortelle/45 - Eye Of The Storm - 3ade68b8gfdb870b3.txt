EYE OF THE STORM

I walk with the wind
With my head up high
Limitless in motion
Heading for the sky
Try to follow me
Or be left behind
Down here there is nothing
Left for me to find

From the lies of the fire
To the eye of the storm
Bound by endless desire
Forever reborn
I walk amongst the living
Like you walk amongst the dead
Limitless in motion
Thoughts outside my head

Try to see with me
Will you remain blind
In darkness there is nothing
Left for me to find
