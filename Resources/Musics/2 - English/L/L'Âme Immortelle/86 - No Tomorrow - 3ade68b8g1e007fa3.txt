NO TOMORROW

These grey roads seem endless
As the days go by
Waking up each morning
Under a different sky

Far away from home
We step into the light
To resurrect the sleeping
For another night

Tonight we will go up in flames
Driven by our pain and sorrow
And they will all scream out our names
As if there's no tomorrow

We bleed our minds into the air
Behind a veil of grey
And feed upon your holy screams
Whatever they may say

Your tears will satisfy our thirst
And guide us on the way
As they told us in the past
That we haven't gone astray
