COME CLOSER

The victories, the battles won
They`ll never come back to me
The joyful moments, free from care
They`ll never come back to me

Come a little closer angel
Let me see where I belong 
I`m ready for your sentence
In this moment, I am strong

The victories, the battles won
They`ll never come back to me
The suffering, the struggles gone
But still no light to see

The joyful moments, free from care
They`ll never come back to me
The fear and desperation`s gone
But still no light to see

Hollow moments
Hollow times
The punishment for all my crimes 
A hollow truth 
For me to face
Like an angel who fell from grace

Come a little closer...
Even time can`t dry the tears
Come a little closer...
I spilled while searching for the light
Come a little closer...
No absolution for my soul
Come a little closer...
My deeds demand their bitter toll
