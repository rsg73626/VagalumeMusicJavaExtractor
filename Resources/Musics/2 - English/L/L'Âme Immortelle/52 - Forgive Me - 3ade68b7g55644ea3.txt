FORGIVE ME

All the dreams that I have had 
They lie shattered on the floor 
But I found waht I was searching 
I have never wanted more 

I am forced to leave this life behind 
You remain behind the door 
But our love stays in my heart 
I have never wanted more 

Please forgive me, but I have to leave 
Stand up proud and show no grief 
In this hour, I will pray 
That we´ll be joined again some day 
Our love is stronger than the sun 
And will still shine, when I am gone 
I´m so afraid to cross this line 
Please hold me for one last time 

The marks I left, the deeds I´ ve done 
Will remind the world of me 
Some hearts will bear my memory 
I have never wanted more 

Also these lines shall shine up high 
To show the people who I´ve been 
A loving man of pride and passion 
I have never wanted more
