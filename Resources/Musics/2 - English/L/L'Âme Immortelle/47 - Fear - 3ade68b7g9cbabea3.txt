FEAR

Fear
M: Rainer, Kraushofer, Dayour / T: Rainer

										
I am far from what Iâ€™ve been
A new world for me to see
All precious things that I have seen
Look simple and so small to me

All banners waved are set aflame
As mountains rise in front me
No mercy and no one to blame
For the darkness I will to see

With every aspect of my soul
I am longing for relief
From this darkest certainty
I wish I could believe

Every second I seek answers
To the question that has none
That has to remain unanswered
Until we are gone

With every hour that I spend
On exploring this terrain
Fear is growing, ever onward
How long can I stand this pain?

With every aspect of my soul
I am longing for relief
From this darkest certainty
I just wish I could believe

That there will be something
After bodies cease to be
The fear that there could be nothing
Is paralysing me
