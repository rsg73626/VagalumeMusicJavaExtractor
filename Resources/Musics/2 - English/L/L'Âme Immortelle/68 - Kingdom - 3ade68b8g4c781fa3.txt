KINGDOM

my summer’s worn out
and my winter’s just begun
my last snow has fallen
with the dawning of the sun

i see them staring at me
with their greedy eyes
i clench my fist and hatred rises
as I fall into demise

i want to take their lives for freedom
and consume their souls for peace
a total war to find my kingdom
my total war to find release

when bones are broken, blood is spilled
by a fist that’s led with force
will the minds change bitter plans
or continue on their course

can the pain that one might bring
change a state of mind
can the taking of a life
bring light to the blind?
