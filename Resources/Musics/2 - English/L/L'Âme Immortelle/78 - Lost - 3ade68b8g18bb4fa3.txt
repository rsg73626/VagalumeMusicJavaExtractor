LOST

The weight of the world lies on my shoulders
The castles I builtare made out of sand
Everyone is a little bit lost sometimes
When everything seems to get out of hand

My best dreams have turned to nightmares
The demons inside have not yet been bannned
Everyone is a little bit lost sometimes
When everything seems to get out of hand
