DISHARMONY

My poems fade as flows of time
Tear apart my withered state
The written words no longer rhyme
A broken soul, the paper torn

Letters that once made up words
Don`t have a meaning anymore
Carried away by nighttime birds
A blank page left to die

The songs I wrote fade with the wind
As the wheel of ages turns
The muses once upon me grinned
But now they speak no more

Notes that made up melodies
Distort into disharmony
Like a ghost that swiftly flees
And vanishes as daybreak comes
