DROWN THEM

I sing your songs of wisdom
Painful sorrow and relief
Words that heal the bleeding
Wounds of disbelief
I tell you stories of perfection
Dreaming and asking why
Words to heal the painful longing
Staring at the sky

The sun will set on the horizon
Like how it's meant to be
Let those bleeding wounds be gone
And drown them in the sea
I whisper words of healing
Onto your skin at night
Words that make you tremble
With delight

I breathe my soul into you
With every tear you cry
Everyone will hold the truth
Staring at the sky
