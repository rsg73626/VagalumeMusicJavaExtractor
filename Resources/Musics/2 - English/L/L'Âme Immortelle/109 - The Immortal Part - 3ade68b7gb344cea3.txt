THE IMMORTAL PART

When I meet the morning beam 
Or lay me down at night to dream
I hear my bones within me say 
Another night, another day 

The man of flesh and soul be slain 
And the man of bone remain 

These today are proud in power 
And lord it in their little hour 
The immortal bones obey control 
Of dying flesh and dying soul
The immortal bones obey control 
Of dying flesh and dying soul

'This long till eve and morn are gone
Slow the endless night comes on 
And late to fullness growns the birth 
That shall last as long as earth 

These today are proud in power 
And lord it in their little hour 
The immortal bones obey control 
Of dying flesh and dying soul

These today are proud in power 
And lord it in their little hour 
The immortal bones obey control 
Of dying flesh and dying soul

Wanderers eastward, wanderers west, 
Know you why you cannot rest 
'Tis that every mother's son 
Travails with a skeleton 

When shall this slough of sense be cast, 
This dust of thoughts be laid at last
Bring the eternal seed to light 
And morn is all the same as night 

Rest you so from trouble sore, 
Fear the heat o' the son no more 
Nor the snowing winter wild 
Now you labour not with child 

Empty vessel, garment cast 
We that wore you long shall last 
Another night, another day 
So my bones within me say
