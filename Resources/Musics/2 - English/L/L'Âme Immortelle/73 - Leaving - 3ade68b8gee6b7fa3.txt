LEAVING

Unfold your heart and let me see 
The pain you bear, because of me 
IÂ´m innocent but broke your heart 
Destroyed your dreams, ripped them apart

Ask gods above and gods below 
To tell you why I have to go 
Have I deserved this punishment 
Please guide me to understand 

Ask gods above and gods below 
Why my life will stop its flow 
The gods deserved this punishment 
To guide you to understand
