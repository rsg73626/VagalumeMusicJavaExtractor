DEMON BE GONE

The moment I first saw you
Time froze before my eyes
Have you been a gift of god
Or a devil in disguise

Your beauty made me tremble
Made me fall down on my knees
In blood red snow I'm begging
For this pain to cease

Leave me alone
You are blinding me
Demon be gone
You push me into misery

Leave me alone
For you'll give me life
Demon be gone
And end this strife

I can't let go of all desires
I want to make you mine
But I know that this will end
End my empire's decline

I cannot ruin all I treasure
I cannot lose my way
I will not give into temptation
But you'll always be with me
