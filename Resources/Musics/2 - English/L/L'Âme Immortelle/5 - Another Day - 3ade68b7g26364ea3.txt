ANOTHER DAY

As I sit along the shore
Of my wishes and my dreams
My pride lies scattered on the floor
With the fading sunlight beams

My thoughts embraced by nothingness
Mindwaves passing by so slow
I long for your tender caress
As innocent as young fresh snow

As the silence fades away
I gather strength for another day
Another day I've to go through
Another day here, without you

To flee from my addiction
I go out, to seek the voices
That speak an empty benediction
Of hollow words and empty choices

But these words, they keep me sane
Until the moment you return
Where I let go of all the pain
Free of anger and concern

And I feel your warmth and love
As it into me doth flow
I come to only one conclusion
I will never let you go
