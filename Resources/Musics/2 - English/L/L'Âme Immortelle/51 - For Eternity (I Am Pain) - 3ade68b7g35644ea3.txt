FOR ETERNITY (I AM PAIN)

Awaiting the final hour
Before I go away
Awaiting the darkness
I have nothing to fear 

When the soul leaves the body
Blanket of bloody stains
There is nobody
When I leave for the astral plains

This is the solution 
For your problems
Death will come and make you free 

Never me, eternally
After death has come
I’ll be released and free
For eternity

But when you’re gone
There’s no reason to be sad
As long as someone loves you
You won’t be dead
