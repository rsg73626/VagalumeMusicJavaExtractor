WITHOUT YOU

Without You

You drove away my winter
Covering my soul
The veil that paralysed me
With the sunlight that we stole

You stand by me in times of need
You heal my wounds in my defeat
You make me complete

I `d rather die
Than live without you
I don`t want to see the sun
Without you be my side

When I look into your face
Your eyes seem innocent and pure
And your breath caresses me
In your arms I feel secure

You stand by me in times of need
You heal my wounds in my defeat
You make me complete
