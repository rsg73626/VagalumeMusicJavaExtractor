ECHOES

I hear echoes of past voices
Of a time that's over now
It distorts to hollow noises
And it slowly fades away

I hear echoes of our dreams
Where the other had a place
It disappears in distant schemes
In this dawning day

I will not waste a tear for you
For all the pain, you put me through
And I hear echoes of the past
When they stop I'm free at last

Echoes that do guide me well
Through my walks on lonely streets

Streets that lead the way to hell
That I now roam alone

Echoes that do follow me
Everywhere I go

That reflect in all I see
One day they'll be gone
