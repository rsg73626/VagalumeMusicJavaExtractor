DUSK EMBRACES LONILENESS

Dusk embraces loneliness
My futile misery
Slowly I die away
For all of you to see

Deep inside my soul
Time passes by
For one last time
No more tears are left to cry

When the sun has risen
My eyes have grown so dim
I close them for the last time
To conserve the joy I`ve seen

When the night is overwhelmed
To make room for the day
I move on to some other place
Like a rose I`ll fade away

Like a rose you`ll fade away
With every hour, every day
Thorns and blossoms die away
Like the words you forgot to say
