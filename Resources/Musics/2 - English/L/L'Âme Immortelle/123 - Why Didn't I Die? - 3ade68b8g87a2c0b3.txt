WHY DIDN'T I DIE?

(Into the sky
What do you see when you're in the dark?
And the demons come?)

I've put my trust in all your senses
Put down all my defences
To let you peek inside
The abyss that I try to hide

I've tried to open up my eyes
Started lifting my disguise
To let you peek inside
The darkness that I try to hide

Back in the days, everything seemed allright
Back in the days, the Sun was bright (it hurt me)

Why did the darkness go away?
Why did I long for the new day?
Why did I look up into the sky?
Asking myself: why didn't I die?

Why did the darkness go away?
Why did I long for the new day?
Why did I look up into the sky?
Asking myself: why didn't I die?

(And the demons come)

I've put my trust in all my senses
Put up all my defences
To close up again and hide
And not to let you peek inside

I tried so hard to close my eyes
Started improving my disguise
To close up again and hide
And not to let you peek inside

Why didn't I die?
Why did the darkness go away?
Why did I long for the new day?
Why did I look up into the sky?
Asking myself: why didn't I die?

Why did the darkness go away?
Why did I long for the new day?
Why did I look up into the sky?
Asking myself: why didn't I die?

Why didn't? Why didn't I die?
