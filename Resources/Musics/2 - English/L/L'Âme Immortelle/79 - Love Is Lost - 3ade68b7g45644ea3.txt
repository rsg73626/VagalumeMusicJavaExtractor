LOVE IS LOST

When the sun drops behind the mountains
Never to rise again
When comes the death of the starlit fountains
Never to shine again
Then the gardens show withered flowers
Never to bloom again
And the crops will enjoy their last harvest

In our time where love is gone
The harvest of souls it has begun
The dark clouds from above come down
Satan came to claim his crown

Hear the weeping of a thousand widows
In this time of war
Where powermongers expand their wealth
Fall victim to the evil lore
Hear the mourners come and pray
To bury their beloved
Who lost their lives in senseless wars
Will somone understand

It's not the evil from down below
Which creeps and lurks under the snow
It's not of Satan's will we fall
It's due to the evil in us
