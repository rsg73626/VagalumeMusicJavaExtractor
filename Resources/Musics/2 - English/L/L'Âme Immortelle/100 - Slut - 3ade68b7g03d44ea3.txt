SLUT

Misled children 
Tortured souls 
Masochistic need 
A bell tolls 

For those who feel 
Nothing inside 
No love, no hate 
No stars bright 

Raped by life 
They give their pride 
And will end up 
With no one at their side 

You´re just a slut with no honour and no pride 
You´re just a slut and it is time for you to finally confide 
You are a slut, you are alone 
You will die here on your own 
You are a slut you ran astray 
And you´ve thrown your life away 

Loneliness your destination 
No helping hand and no salvation 
For those who do not know 
The meaning of feelings 

I turn away 
And you don´t care 
There´ll be another one waiting 
In the city square
