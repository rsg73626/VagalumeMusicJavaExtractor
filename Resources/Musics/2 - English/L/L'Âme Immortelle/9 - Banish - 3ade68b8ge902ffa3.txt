BANISH

Overshadowing the beauty
The sun and light of day
Standing guard to solitude
Keeping life away

Ghosts who cloud my senses
Embrace the night and sway
Leaving nothing but a wasteland
Of my soul back to decay

To those demons of the past
You are forsaken
And the buried spells I cast
Shall not awaken

To long I've been haunted
And lost without control
Give me back my freedom
And all the days you stole

Obey my will demon
Banished you shall be
As far behind illusions
There's so much more to see

To the lies you said, the tears I shed
And all the songs I bled
I sing these lines to banish you
To banish you
