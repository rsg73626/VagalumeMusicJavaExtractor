WHY CAN'T I MAKE YOU FEEL

The emptiness my hands do touch
When I long to hold you close
Without the words that mean so much
Down a path I did not choose

With willingness I speak these lies
To make you go away
It breaks my heart with endless cries
Cause I want you to stay

Why can't I make you feel
How much I love you
Why can't I make you feel
How much I care

My hopelessness keeps us apart
With all this pain of mine
It's just a veil that clouds my heart
To force it not to shine

The loneliness devours my soul
Dying, drowning in its tears
My life and lies out of control
After all these years
