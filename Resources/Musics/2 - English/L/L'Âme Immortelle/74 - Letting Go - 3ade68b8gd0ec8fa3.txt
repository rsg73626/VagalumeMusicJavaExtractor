LETTING GO

Your face that seemed like heaven
From now on is pure hell
The aweful truth that held no answers
Ripped me from my revery

The meaning lost, the innocence
That kept me going on my way
My world be shattered by your lips
That summon up the words you say

This is the time of letting go
Both of us will find new ways
Life will continue in its flow
But the memories stay

Unnoticed moments full of anger
This turned you into what I see
Or did the truth that I do face now
Build this throne of misery

Times do pass and wounds do heal
My soul was struck by all this strife
Every rose does bear its thorns
But it`s beauty stays alive
