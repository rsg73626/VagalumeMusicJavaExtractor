WINTER OF MY SOUL

My soul is frozen to the ground
My mind is crippled, left no sound
I'm lying here await my doom
For my future won`t be coming soon

Lying lifeless deep inside
All that's left of joy and pride
Waiting for the final hour
Like a bloodred, withered flower

In this night I'll achieve my goal
It's a night in the winter of my soul

Please give me deliverance
Oh, grim reaper let me dance
One final time before I die
when time has come no one will cry

Forgotten like a winter morning
Life's decision wheel keeps turning
No one hears the silent mourning
Deep inside my heart is burning
