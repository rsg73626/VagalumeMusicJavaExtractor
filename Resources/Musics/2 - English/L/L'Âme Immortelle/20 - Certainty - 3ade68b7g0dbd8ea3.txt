CERTAINTY

Certainty

I tried to wash your scent
From the surface of my skin
I tried to drown my memory

I tried to mute your voice
That still echoes in my ear
I tried to chase away the shadows

Will I ever find peace, will I ever be free
Will I ever be blessed with certainty
If you were the one to make me whole
And bring enlightement to my soul

I tried to rip the skies apart
That threw their shades at me
I tried to cut my eyes wide open

I tried so hard to destroy
But didn`t find salvation
To find relief, to realise
