THE TRUTH BEHIND

On the edge of this world
In the darkness of your soul
The only hold you have
Are your beliefs, that conquer all

All the doubts and all you hide
Like a curtain these will fall
And reveal the truth behind
The lies that obey your call

There are dreams I do believe
That do guide and not deceive
There are dreams I do believe
That reveil what you conceive

Shatter your illusions
To conquer what is real
Surrender to your fellings
Cry out loud what you conceil

Believe in your powers
Your dreams will come true
As long as you believe in you
Nothing in this world can stop you
