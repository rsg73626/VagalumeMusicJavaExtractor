NO TRUST

Every word you say
Every hour you spend
Feeds the dagger
In the traitor's hand

Everyone you trust
Everyone you believe in
Will be your enemy
Life's a game you cannot win

No trust, no trust
In this world of lies
No trust, no trust
The devil in disguise

But even with this knowledge
We keep on searching
For someone to trust in
For someone to believe in

We are liars to ourselves
Even oneself deserves no trust
We seek and seek, find empty shells
And are backstabbed instantly
