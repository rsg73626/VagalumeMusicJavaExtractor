FINAL SECONDS

The day has come, out of time
Journey's end - it's the end of the line
A time for tears, to face your fears
Retrace the years, here by fate or by design
Will you stare back in sorrow
Or remember the smiles and the sighs

So farewell everyone
One look back now the race is all but run
End of day, no more to say
Accept your fate
Or do you pray it's some mistake

Be it leading or follow
Face the truth, were you all you should be
In the final seconds of your life
Will you cry or fly
As you walk into the light
"So take me"
One last reflection on your time
As it fades away
And you face your last tomorrow
Forever
Your time has come
