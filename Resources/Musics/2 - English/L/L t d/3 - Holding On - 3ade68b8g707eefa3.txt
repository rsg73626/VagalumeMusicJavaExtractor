HOLDING ON

Holding on is very hard to do
When love is gone and that's no lie
Holding on is very hard to do
When love is gone hey, hey, hey, ya

I betcha you're unhappy
I know you gotta be (I know you gotta be)
'cause it can drive you out your mind
There ain't no sense in cryin'
It's time for you to leave (time for you to leave)
Baby, that's the bottom line

I betcha lie awake nights and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear (ya ya ya)
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair

(repeat chorus)

Ha-ha-ha who are you kidding
Doo doo doo doo doo
Ha-ha-ha who are you kidding
Doo doo doo doo doo
Ha-ha-ha who are you kidding
Doo doo doo doo doo
Ha-ha-ha who are you kidding

(repeat chorus)

I betcha you're unhappy
I know you gotta be (I know you gotta be)
'cause it can drive you out your mind
There ain't no sense in cryin'
It's time for you to leave (time for you to leave)
Baby, that's the bottom line

I betcha lie awake nights and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear (ya ya ya)
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair

(repeat chorus)

Said holding on is very hard to do
When love is gone and that's no lie
Holding on is very hard to do
When love is gone
When love is gone, hey

Holding on yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
When love is gone oh I said
Holding on so very hard to do
So very hard to do, yeah
I said I said I said
Hey, I said
Listen to me now

When you know the feeling's gone
Then you've got to stop holdin' on
'cause that makes it twice as bad
You can't give a love that you don't have
So why drag it on and on and on

Holding on (on and on, yeah)
When love is gone (love, love, said now)
Holding on is so very hard not to do
When your love is gone
When your love is gone
