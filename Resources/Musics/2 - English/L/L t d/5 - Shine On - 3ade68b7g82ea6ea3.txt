SHINE ON

Just yesterday I cast my eyes
Upon your loving face
But that was yesterday
Now just a dream
A dream that lives inside my memory
Wish it could be reality

Shine on yesterday
Carry me away
And let me be back in your arms
Holding you again
Shine on yesterday
Carry me away to be with you
Somehow let my dream come true

You know sometimes I stop and stare
No matter where I am
Thinking of you again
Once in a while I call your name out loud
Hoping you'll hear
Hoping my prayer will bring you here

Shine on yesterday
Carry me away
And let me be back in your arms
Holding you again
shine on yesterday
Carry me away to be with you
Because this is for me, my one and only dream
I ever wanted to come true
Somehow let my dream come true
