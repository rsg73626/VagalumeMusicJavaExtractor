NEVER WAS

I know you lie I'm well aware
I just want to be that dumb
It's like it never happened
It's like it never was


Chorus:
I did everything you wanted
But it wasn't what you want
I did everything you needed
But it wasn't near enough


Life's a bitch and then we die
Said before and still applies
You try to make it happen
And suffer all along


Chorus


It's like it never happened
It's like it never was


Chorus
