HEART SHAPED SCAR

A fire in the night
You're better without me

I'm seeing colors coming back
A lightness in the black
You're better without me

I am never going to change
I never wanted to
We've been blind to what we hear
We have to see what's true

It's all we know
It's all we are
Then all that's left Is just a little heart shaped scar

It's all we know
It's all we are
Then all that's left Is just a little heart shaped scar

I know I've been wrong a thousand times
But baby I ain't blind
You're better without me

There's no telling what you're going to find
Shit happens all the time
You're better without me

We've been running blind so long with everything so wrong
But the screams they go so loud
We couldn't turn them off

It's all we know
It's all we are
Then all that's left Is just a little heart shaped scar

It's all we know
It's all we are
Then all that's left Is just a little heart shaped scar
