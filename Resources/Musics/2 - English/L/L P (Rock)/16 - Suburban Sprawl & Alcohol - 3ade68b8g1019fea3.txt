SUBURBAN SPRAWL & ALCOHOL

Suburban sprawl and alcohol
And what's the use in anything at all
When you can't remember and you can't forget
And you want to change
But you haven't yet and . . .


We all turn back in the end (2x)


I couldn't wait to get away
From all the things I love to hate
Like the kitchen table and the sewing room
When it was finally over
It was too soon and . . .


We all turn back in the end (2x)


Suburban Sprawl and alcohol
And what's the use in anything at all when . . .


We all turn back in the end (4x)
