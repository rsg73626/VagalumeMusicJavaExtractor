NOWHERE

Sick of it all
I'm sayin' I'm sorry
Can't we escape for one more day
When memories fail I got a photograph smile
I'm making it last for one more day
Hear all the laughter fading away
It's here in my head for one more day
Lying awake I lie to myself we're holdling on for one more day
So leave me behind
Don't leave me behind


Chorus:
I'm goin' nowhere
I can't decide what's best for you
You're waiting somewhere
I wish that I could go there too
But I'm gonna wait for you


I heard a song while I was driving away
It brought it all back for one more day
Here comes the sun
Baby nobody knows maybe we'll make it one more day
So leave me behind
Don't leave me behind


Chorus


Leavin me behind was always understood
You've got to take your time in the sun
Said you gotta go when flowers turn to snow
The river's gotta flow
You got where you have to go


Chorus
