DARKSIDE

Let's go back and talk about the beginning
And what we liked so much about each other then
And I hope you're happy with your ordinary life
It's the wrong place
The wrong time
The darkside


Hoppin' bars in the summertime
And no one cared if you lost your mind
But you were not amused, no you were not amused
I hope you're happy with your ordinary life
It's the wrong place
The wrong time
The darkside


I wanted to say the right thing - I really did
But I know you're right
And I hope you're happy with your ordinary life
