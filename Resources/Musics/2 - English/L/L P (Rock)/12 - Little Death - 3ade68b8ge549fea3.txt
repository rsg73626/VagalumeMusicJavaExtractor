LITTLE DEATH

Can you come for me when I get down
Can you catch me when I hit the ground
We're connected baby
We're the same
Did you feel that, baby?
I just came


Can't be near you without there being fire (2x)


Girl you know what makes me go like hell
My mouth just waters when I hear the bell
I'm a dog for you but I move like a cat
I can't help it when you look like that


Can't be near you without there being fire (2x)


I know where you're coming from
You only really want it once and you're gone
You know that you are


Don't look down we're way too high
I'm the only one who makes you fly
Because you're mine


Can't be near you without there being fire (2x)
