CLING TO ME

I know it seems blacker than midnight
No one knows you, no one to hold tight
Everything you are isn't what they thought
Everything you learn isn't what they taught
Everything is wrong, no you don't belong
Before you slip hopelessly, cling to me

You can say anything to me
When you're lost, turn and see
You know I'll always be here,
Never let go
Cling to me. (oh)
Cling to me. (oh)

When you're too hurt to talk, I am a rock
Cling to me. (oh)
Cling to me.

Cold and Dark and running through the streetlights
Leading someone, and not a soul is in sight
It's hard inside your head, wishing you were dead
Always by yourself, calling out for help
I'm right over here, don't give into fear
When you are hurt, I bleed.

Cling to me
You can say anything to me
When you're lost, turn and see
You know I'll always be here,
Never let go
Cling to me. (oh)
Cling to me. (oh)

When you're too hurt to talk, I am a rock
Cling to me. (oh)
Cling to me.

Oh, before you slip hopelessly
Cling to me
You can say anything to me
When you're lost, turn and see
You know I'll always be here,
Never let go
Cling to me. (oh)
Cling to me. (oh)

When you're too hurt to talk, I am a rock
Cling to me. (oh)
Cling to me.
