WASTED

Don't waste it,
It's only here for today,
You don't own it,
So you can't just give it away,
Forever, Forever is half a moment away,
So don't waste it,
It's only here for today,
Everything is waiting here,

Don't mess with my heart, don't mess with my mind,
Won't let you get us down this time.
You'll like what you see, and take it from me,
You'll learn to see it over time.
Get wasted on love, get wasted on life,
Get wasted on anything that's right.
Get wasted, get wasted, get wasted,
Get wasted with me.

It seems empty,
I don't know what you expect,
If you don't give,
You're never going to get,
Forever is half a moment away,
You don't get, back what you thew away.
Everything is waiting here.

Don't mess with my heart, don't mess with my mind,
Won't let you get us down this time.
You'll like what you see, and take it from me,
You'll learn to see it over time.
Get wasted on love, get wasted on life,
Get wasted on anything that's right.
Get wasted, get wasted, get wasted,
Get wasted with me.

Everything is waiting here

Don't mess with my heart, don't mess with my mind,
Won't let you get us down this time.
You'll like what you see, and take it from me,
You'll learn to see it over time.
Get wasted on love, get wasted on life,
Get wasted on anything that's right.
Get wasted, get wasted, get wasted,
Get wasted with me.
