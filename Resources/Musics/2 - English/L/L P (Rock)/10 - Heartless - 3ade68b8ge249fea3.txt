HEARTLESS

Lottery tickets piling up
I'm in a dead end job don't know what up
I'm rushing around
God knows this city has got no soul
Killin' time and it kills me back
I'm lost in space and I got no map
They're pushin' me down tryin' to break my back
Baby you're so cold


Chorus:
You're heartless
You make me feel loveless
I thought there was one less person in the world to bring me down
You're heartless
You make me feel reckless
I thought there was one less person in the world to bring me down
You always told me not to worry
But lately it's a different story


The pawnshop guy knows me much to well
And I'm starting to go to bars by myself
This life on the edge shit can be such hell
It's a hard way to go
My horoscope says I got no hope
I'm afraid to know if there's much more rope
I think I'll move to the western coast
Start again


Chorus
