GET OVER YOURSELF

You like to be first, treated like a king
And people you know they give you everything
You're fucking spoiled rotten from all the things you've gotten


Chorus:
Get over yourself you're not that great
We're all just trying to make our way
No one is above anyone else
So baby just get over yourself


You're hateable
It's not debatable
For everything you gain you lose some of yourself
You feel superior and everyone is inferior, so . . .


Chorus
