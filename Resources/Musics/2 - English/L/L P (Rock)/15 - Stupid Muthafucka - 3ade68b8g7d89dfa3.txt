STUPID MUTHAFUCKA

I've been looking
I've been searching
your face for a clue somewhere
you keep on lying
while I'm trying
to keep us together baby

you got me thinking this whole thing's a mess cuz of me
but it's you
and I wish I had known just one thing...

Those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
that you would break my heart
those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
that you would leave me in the dark
those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
you would be leavin'
they shoulda told me you didn't care
you stupid muthafucka yeah

I was foolish, fucking clueless
I'll be screwed for the next 5 years
I'll be cryin', there's no denying
but you'll never see my tears
I'll never speak to you or see you again
not next week, not next year, not next life
and my friends suck right now
yes they do....

Those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
that you would break my heart
those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
that you would leave me in the dark
those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
you would be leavin'
they shoulda told me you didn't care
you stupid muthafucka yeah!

I'm the one, I'm the one
but you're too dumb to know
and this one's for my friends
you know who you are
and I just wanna ask you one more time...
What the fuck??

Those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
that you would break my heart
those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
that you would leave me in the dark
those stupid muthafuckas shoulda told me
you would be leavin'
they shoulda told me you didn't care
you stupid muthafucka yeah!!!
