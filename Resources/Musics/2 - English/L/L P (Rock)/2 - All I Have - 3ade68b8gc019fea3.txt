ALL I HAVE

Hold on another time is waiting for us someplace close
A gun to the head you made your bed and you can't stop the ghosts


I was wrong when I lied
I was going to tell you
I was wrong, we were young
And I can't forget you


Chorus:
I had a dream last night and you were walking all alone
I couldn't reach you and you slipped away into the crowd
Now all I have is a photo of you smiling at me
All I want is you here with me and I'll be happy


Hey close the door I'm waiting for the light to knock it down
They say experience will recompense what you lost today


I was wrong when I lied
I was going to tell you
I was wrong we were young
And I'll never forget you


Chorus


Oh I'd do anything


Oh to have you here again


Chorus
