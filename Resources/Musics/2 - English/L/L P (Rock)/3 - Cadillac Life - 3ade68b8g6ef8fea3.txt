CADILLAC LIFE

Ten dead soldiers in the middle of the table
And what do I know about love
I wanna run away from every damn thing and just run


But baby this is harder than I ever expected
What if I lose my mind
This long dark night of the soul is sure long and dark


Chorus:
I wanna trade my Chevy for a Cadillac life and drive it on and on
Crank that motor to a hundred and ten and then wave goodbye
I'm gone
I'm gone


Cause the drinkin' don't stop and the drugs chime in
But I can quite any time that I want
Since the concrete jungle came tumblin' down we're all lost


Chorus


Gasoline get me to a place I love and I promise that I'll never look back


Chorus
