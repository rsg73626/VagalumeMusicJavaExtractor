INTO THE WILD

Are we on the lonely side
Say oh now the past long away
Are we're so lost in the dark of our hearts
That there's no light of day
No oh oh oh
No oh oh oh

1, 2, 3, 4!

Somebody left the gate open
You know we got lost on the way
Come save us a runaway train
Goin insaane

How? do we How do we not fade
How do we how do we how do we not fade away
How do we how do we ooooh

Into the wild
How are we living living living
Into the wild
How are we living living living

Wooohooo
Wooohoohoo
Heeeyy
Heeey

Oh please believe me Im more scared than not
That oh now this isnt the way
And please be there I can barely hang on
But oh I wait til I break
Yea eh eh eh
Yea eh eh eh

Somebody left the gate open
You know we got lost on the way
Come save us a runaway train
Goin insane

How do we how do we not fade
How do we how do we how do we not fade away
How do we how do we ooooooooh

Into the? wild
How are we living living living
Into the wild
How are we living living living

Wooohoooh!
Woohooahoo
