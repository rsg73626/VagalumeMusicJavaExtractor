TALKIN' 'BOUT RAMBO

Rambo -
Deep in the jungle
fighting for justice and freedom

No one can beat him
that human fighting-machine.
Eyes like an eagle
a big knife and iron arrows.
No one can catch him
if you know what I mean -
The strongest man I know.
Talkin' 'bout Rambo
he's my hero

talkin' 'bout Rambo
my hero !

Rambo-Rambo-Rambo-

He was betrayed
they send him out for a mission.
To find the soldiers way-out the woods of Saigon.
It was a trap
yeah
by the Russians and Americans.
They can't believe it: he survived and he won.

The strongest man I know.
Talkin' 'bout Rambo
he's my hero

talkin' 'bout Rambo
my hero !

Rambo - Rambo
my hero - Rambo
my hero - Rambo -
