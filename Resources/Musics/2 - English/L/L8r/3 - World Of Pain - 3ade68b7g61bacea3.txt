WORLD OF PAIN

Washing your brains
Trying to remove the stains
Of personality  -  individuality
Better behave  -  do as they say
Welcome to govern mentality
Theres no reality
It's a game
With a name called lies and corruption
-  disease interruption
You wanna play  -  don't be afraid
We're only using weapons of mass destruction

Hey now, you better pray now
That things will get better tomorrow, yeah
But hey now, every day now
Children living in the streets, begging, steeling and borrowing
Hey now, what will you say now
When the truth comes out, that you've been lying
Hey now, don't run away now
Now there's nothing left but the tears we're crying

And we're all falling down
(In a world of pain)
And we're all falling down
(In to a world of pain)
No one can save us now 
Can you hear me crying out
In a world of pain

It's a shame, media denies the blame
They got us living in cages
Feeding us fear on pages
Boom  -  Ratatata â€“ Kaboom
Now war is contageous, fun for all ages
Fantastic, everybody is wearing plastic
It's a chemical parade for the underpaid
All for greed, taking all they want, they need
Watching youbleed, knocking us down so we won't succeed

Hey now, you better pray now
That things will get better tomorrow, yeah
But hey now, every day now
Children living in the streets, begging, steeling and borrowing
Hey now, what will you say now
When the truth comes out, that you've been lying
Hey now, don't run away now
Now there's nothing left but the tears we're crying

And we're all falling down (falling down)
(In a world of pain)
And we're all falling down
(In to a world of pain)
No one can save us now ( save us now)
Can you hear me crying out
(In a world of pain)

And we're all falling down (falling down)
(In a world of pain)
And we're all falling down
(In to a world of pain)
No one can save us now (no one can save us now)
Can you hear me crying out
(In a world of pain)

Yeeeaah! Yeeeaaaah!

Into a world of pain

In a world of pain
