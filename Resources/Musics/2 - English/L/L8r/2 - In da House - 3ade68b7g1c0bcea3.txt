IN DA HOUSE

In da house.. (Hey!)

Check it out…

L8r…

come on, come on (ah, ah)

We're the cream of the crop we don't take no crap
the new kids on the block with a new kind of rap
strap yourself in your seat and get ready to rock
we were built for speed, we're gonna beat the clock

We'll knock you off your feet like a rolling stone
we hit the lowest keys and the highest tones
we move the biggest crowds to the biggest halls
we like to play it loud, we've got the biggest balls

You can’t stop!
If you wanna go, you gotta go with da flow
So get up! 
L8R’s In Da House!

Everybody sing...
Hey now, hey na-na-na!
Let loose and get down, the future is l8r..
Hey now, hey na-na-na!
Get up and get loud, we’re gonna show you
Hey now, hey na-na-na!
We’ll not gonna stop until we reach the top
L8R’s in da house…

From the back to the front you just can't sit still
when we rock the mic you know we've got the skills
to pay all our bills we never pay to play
and we couldn't care less what our parents say

We kick up a storm every time we perform
we're dressed for success but no uniforms
It's all strictly street but with a new kind of beat
and it's all guaranteed to make you move your feet

You can’t stop!
If you wanna go, you gotta go with da flow
So get up! 
L8R’s in da house

Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-naaa!
Let me hear you say
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-naaa!
One more time
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-naaa!
come on, come on
You just can’t stop, you just can’t stop!
