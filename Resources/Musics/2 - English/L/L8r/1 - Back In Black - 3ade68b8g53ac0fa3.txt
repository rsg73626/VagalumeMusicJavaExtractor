BACK IN BLACK

Back in black, I hit the sack,
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm let loose from the noose,
That's kept me hangin' about
I been livin like a star 'cause it's gettin' me high,
Forget the hearse, 'cause I never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes 
abusing every one of them and running wild

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!

Back in a band,i got Cadillac,
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes I'm in a band with a gang,
they gotta catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack,
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now, I'm just a makin' my pay,
Don't try to push your luck, just get outta my way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yeah, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!
Let's go!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black-ow!

Aww yeah! Let's go!
Keep on goin'! Yeah yeah!
Yeah... aww yeah yeah!
Here we go!

[Chorus]
Well, I'm baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack... (Well, I'm back!)
Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack...
Yes, back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black...

Outta sight!
