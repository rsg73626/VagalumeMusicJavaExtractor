GOOD MORNING HIDE

The scene you accept and you see
It's easy for me to understand
It must be the same as mine
Why are not they tired?
Why are not they tired?
I don't do the thing like that
I just do it instead

If a morning starts at the moment
When you wake up
It has been morning still now
I don't need a night 
I can not define this place
Except a certain additional value
Everything is unnecessary

It's ok if your destination is the same
The scene will never change

The scene you accept and you see
It's easy for me to understand
It must be the same as mine
The scene they accept and they see
It's different from mine, I don't imagine
I don't do the thing like that
I just do it instead

It seems it has been morning
I'll keep this morning no matter
I spend much time, I go far away
I don't need a night yet
I can take it like this
They will keep their night forever more
You don't need the night at this moment

By the time when the morning turns into the noon
My action will be harmonized

The scene you accept and you see
It's easy for me to understand
It must be the same as mine
The scene they accept and they see
It's different from mine, I don't imagine
I don't do the thing like that
The morning hides all

Why did not you show it?
Why did not you notice it?
Where is your scene from everything?
Please tell me now
Why did not you have it?
Why did not you repeat it?
I don't do the thing like that
I just do it instead

"Yes, everything is an imagination"
"Yes, it's also a realization"

Why did not you show it?
Why did not you notice it?
Why did not you show it?
Why did not you notice it?
Why did not you have it?
Why did not you repeat it?
I don't do the thing like that
Wish I've done it instead...
