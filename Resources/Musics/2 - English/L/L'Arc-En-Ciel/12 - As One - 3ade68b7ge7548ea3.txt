AS ONE

As One
L'arc~En~Ciel
Composição: Lyrics: hyde / Music: hyde

DNA ni haritsuita ooikakusenu shoudou

*1 History repeating - panic and confusion
History is weeping - sense of disillusion
History repeating - pieces of a puzzle
Why can't we just live as one?

*2 Nowhere to run - we're seeking redemption
No waiting for divine intervention
Search for the tree that overcomes death
Taking the fruit - discover a new way to breathe

michi e no KEY wo sashite ochiyuku sei ni sousa wo

*1, *2 repeat

History repeating - science and perversion
History is weeping - weapons of destruction
History repeating - in our final hour
Why can't we just live as one?

*2 repeat
