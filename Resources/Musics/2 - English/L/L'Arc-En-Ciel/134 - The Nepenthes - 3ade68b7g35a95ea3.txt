THE NEPENTHES

Afuresou na ore no toge 
Soko nashi no idenshi 
Sono kizuguchi kakimawashite 
Kuchizuke shiyou karadajuu ni 

Inner-self is calling from the DNA 
I want to lick you around... seductive welcoming 

As if sheltered in the bed of the nepenthes 
As if sheltered in the bed of the nepenthes 

Atama no naka wa sore bakari 
Ai nanka ja shibararenai 
Risei to usotsuki wa kamihito he 
Buchi kowashitara saa ikou 

Inner-self is calling from the DNA 
Pouring my honey to you all night long 
(Pouring you, honey!) (2x)

Inner-self is calling from the DNA 
I want to lick you around... seductive welcoming 

As if sheltered in the bed of the nepenthes 
As if sheltered in the bed of the nepenthes (2x)
