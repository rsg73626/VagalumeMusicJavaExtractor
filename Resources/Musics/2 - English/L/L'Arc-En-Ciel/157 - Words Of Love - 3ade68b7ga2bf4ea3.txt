WORDS OF LOVE

I lost myself I think I need someone in here?
I know I'm sane but still my daemon calls me
A lot of bruises to remind me what I'm hear for
Let's play six six six

You better picture this
I'm not a hopeless case
You want a piece of me?

Say the words of love
If you wanna kiss
If you wanna kiss me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance with me (justify your love)
Let me be
Let's play six six six

You better stick with me
I wonder who is right?
I know you want me too

Say the words of love
If you wanna kiss
If you want a kiss of me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance with me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna kiss
If you want kiss of me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance with me (justify your love)
Let me be

I just want some peace of mind
I need the perfect situation
I want to be a stimulator
I don’t need no other complication
Stop dragging me in your misery

It’s not enough You know how hard it is to make it clear
I might be wrong but no one’s ever told me
Inside my head I hear these voices telling me
Let’s play and kiss kiss kiss

You better picture this
I’m not a hopeless case
You want a piece of me?

Say the words of love
If you wanna kiss
If you want a kiss of me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance with me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna kiss
If you want a kiss of me (justify your love)
Love, if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance with me (justify your love)
Let me be

Let’s play six six six
