ALL DEAD

It's time to fall
It's time to say goodbye
I wish you were gone
I wish you were all dead
kienai omoi
I wish you were all dead

It's time to fall
It's time to say goodbye
I wish you were gone
I wish you were all dead

onaji kizuato o tsuke onaji kutsuu o
kare ni mo ataete agetai
nuke dasenai akumu o ima sugu
kare ni mo ataete agetai
kurui soo na kyoofu o nando mo
kanawanu negai

Say so long!

juyuu o ubatta anata ni
sukoshi mo kienai itami wa
itsumade tsuzuku no ka oshiete
sukoshi mo kienai satsui ni
nayamasarete iru to tsutaete

It's time to fall
It's time to say goodbye
I wish you were gone
I wish you were all dead
all dead
all dead
