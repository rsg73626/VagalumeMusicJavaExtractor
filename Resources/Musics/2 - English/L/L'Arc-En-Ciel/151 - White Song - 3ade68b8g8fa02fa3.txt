WHITE SONG

Breathe
Crisp and cleansing the winter air
I dream of a world ina peaceful sleep
Snow falling gracefully down
Rejoice in winter's deep charm
I can't wait
I can't wait

Freeze
People gather around the fire
I feel all the warmth that the cold inspires
Frost covered tree tops are bright
Shimmering silver tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait

I hope snow will fall upon us soon
Everywhere
The whole world veiled in white
I'd be reset to face the seasons
Once again

Yes on and on falls the snow
Like diamonds from the sky

Kowareta kokoro e furisosoida nara
Haruka na kisetsu mo watatte ikeru!

I hope snow will fall upon us soon
Everywhere
The whole world veiled in white
I'd be reset to face the seasons
Once again
