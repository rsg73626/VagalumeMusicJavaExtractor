GET OUT FROM THE SHELL

worried heart is beating with darkness
feeling so cold and tight inside of the skull
nerve function has been out of order
kissing to the sleeping beauty in the forest
dream is still a dream that never changes
dream is still a dream that never changes

blind fear is lingering around
falling to the deepness of the inner spiral
dream is still a dream that never changes
dream is still a dream that never changes

get rid of your notions
haven't you realized yet? (do it)
get feel of your passion
haven't you realized yet? (go for it)
perceive through the soul

dream is still a dream that never changes
dream is still a dream that never changes
destroying illusion with your hands
destroying illusion with your hands

get rid of your notions
haven't you realized yet? (do it)
get feel of your passion
haven't you realized yet? (go for it)
you get out from the shell

get rid of your notions
haven't you realized yet? (do it)
get feel of your passion
haven't you realized yet? (go for it)
perceive through the soul

get rid of your notions
get rid of your border
get rid of your notions
get rid of your border
