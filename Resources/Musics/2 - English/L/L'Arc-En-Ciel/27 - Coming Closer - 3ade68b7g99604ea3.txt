COMING CLOSER

Coming closer
Hurry on, hurry on time It's going so fast
Hurry on, I can't save you
Can't slow it down You know this is your fate
Are you feeling lonely? So lonely, lonely
Cry to the wind

furisosogu hikari wo abi te wo nobasu dokomade mo takaku
tada kimi ha kaze ni yurarete mitsumete ha hakanaku hohoemu
nemuri no toki wo shitteru no?

Coming closer
Hurry on, hurry on time It's going so fast
Hurry on, I can't save you
Can't slow it down You know this is your fate
Are you feeling lonely? So lonely, lonely
Cry to the wind

afuredasu nagare ni nomare tachitsukusu nasu sube mo nakute 
kono te ha kimi wo iyasenai? 

Coming closer
Hurry on, hurry on time  It's going so fast
Hurry on, I can't save you
Can't slow it down  You know this is your fate
Are you feeling lonely? So lonely, lonely
Cry to the wind

Coming closer
Hurry on, hurry on time It's going so fast
Hurry on, I can't save you
Can't slow it down You know this is your fate
Are you feeling lonely? So lonely, lonely, lonely,

No one cares, no one cares you
No one cares what you do
Can't slow it down You know this is your fate
Are you feeling lonely? So lonely, lonely
Cry to the wind
