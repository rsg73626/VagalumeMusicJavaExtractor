FEELING FINE (ENGLISH TRANSLATION)

Feeling Fine

Are you feeling fine?
On sleepless nights, the illusion of you...
She said, "Loving you made me happy everyday"
Don't talk to me with the innocent face you had back then

Though these feelings must have connected us from the start
I learned what it means to break up a long time ago 

When did the thread get cut and leave you hanging?

Are you feeling fine?
In the middle of the long road, instead of 'goodbye'
She said, "Loving you made me happy everyday"
The world keeps turning, leaving me behind as if I were nothing

Unending freedom...Far more time than I have a use for
But at least I'm free to lock those days behind me

I've forgotten how to open the door that leads into my heart...

Are you feeling fine?
On sleepless nights, the illusion of you...
She said, "Loving you made me happy everyday"
Don't talk to me with the innocent face you had back then

You were somewhere in my fever...

Even now, I can't help but knowing you'll be in my dreams

Are you feeling fine?
Stop trying to resist, move on to tomorrow
I said, "Loving you made me happy everyday"
When did I start sleeping without seeing your smile?
