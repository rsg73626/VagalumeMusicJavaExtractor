MIDNIGHT CELEBRATION

I know what I've seen
Midnight celebration
I want to be free
Midnight celebration
I want you to rise
Midnight celebration
I play you obey
Midnight celebration

I have no plan but that's alright
Can you trust me when I'm mad
Have no time to set things right
Can you trust me when I'm sad
I have no plan but that's alright
Can you trust me when I'm mad
Have no time to set things right
Can you trust me when I'm sad
