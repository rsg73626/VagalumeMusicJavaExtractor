THE SILVER SHINING

in the moon want to sleep want to sleep 
with the silence you heal me again 
through the long and trying day you save me 
in the moon I'm just veiled in the silver shining 

asa no kagayaki wa kegare sae utsusu 

there is nothing I want I stay with you 
and lose all stand still 

in the sun want to sleep want to sleep 
with the sunrise you wake me again 
and make a fuss without notice you confuse me 
in the sun I just beg longest sleepless night 

yoru wa machichu no yasuragi o tousu 

there is nothing I want I stay with you 
and lose all go and sail the sea I've never gone in the sun 

setsunai hibi ni kokoro wa naita 
chigireta koi wa samayou bakari 

there is nothing I want I stay with you 
and lose all stand still 
close to the moon 
lose all we will go 
please stay with me 
and lose all go and sail the sea I've never gone in the sun
