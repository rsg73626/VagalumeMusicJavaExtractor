LOVE FLIES

LOVE FLIES

Hateshinai kimi no moto e
Dore kurai chikazuita darou
Right side of the dream
Left side of the truth
Show me the way

The color is singing
Afureru kagayaki o ataete
Kanawanu sekai e kimi yo hanatte
I feel love flies
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake

Genei ga temaneite iru
Saigo no ai hikikaeyou ka
Right side of the soul
Left side of the life
Show me the way

The color is singing
Toosugita yami o koe tobitatsu
Tsubasa yo takaku e todoke
I feel love flies
Motto soba ni kite kanjite itai
Motto nani ga hoshii kaitte saa
The color is singing
Shining rain is overflowing
All in your mind
Look at the skies
And then I feel
I feel love flies
You have to make my way
The color is singing
Shining rain is overflowing
All in your mind
Look at the skies
And then I feel
I feel love flies
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
Go on fast awake
