SPIRIT DREAMS INSIDE

I wake from a nightmare now
In the day it haunts me
It slowly tears me apart
With dreams of a distant love
I'm a wandering satellite

Somewhere in the wasteland
I see you smiling at me
A vision out of my dreams
Will everything change
Take the pain away
Lead me with your light

Heading for the sun
Leave the sadness behind
Crossing oceans dry
Yeah

My world spinning out of time
Won't somebody stop me?
I may be losing my way
Will you make it right?
Take the pain away
Hear me as I cry

Heading for the sun
Leave the sadness behind
Crossing oceans dry
Deep inside I go

Spirit dreams inside
Spirit dreams inside

What can I do, I ask?
There's nothing left to say
What can I do, I ask?
There's nothing left to say
Why am I here?
Why am I lost?
Where is love?
Lead me with your light

Heading for the sun
Leave the sadness behind
Crossing oceans dry
Deep inside I go
Heading for the sun
Leave the sadness behind
Crossing oceans dry
Deep inside I go

Spirit dreams inside
Spirit dreams inside
Spirit dreams inside
Spirit dreams inside
