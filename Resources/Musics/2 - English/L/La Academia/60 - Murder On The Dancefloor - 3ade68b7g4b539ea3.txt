MURDER ON THE DANCEFLOOR

Murder... 
It's murder on the dancefloor 
But you better not kill the groove 
Dj, gonna burn this goddamn house right down 

Oh, I know I know I know I know I know I know
About your kind 
And so and so and so and so and so and so 
I'll have to play 

If you think you're getting away 
I will prove you wrong 
I'll take you all the way 
Boy, just come along 
Hear me when I say 
Hey 

Chorus: 
It's murder on the dancefloor 
But you better not kill the groove 
Hey hey hey hey 
It's murder on the dancefloor 
But you better not steal the moves 
Dj, gonna burn this goddamn house right down 

Oh I know I know I know I know I know I know 
There may be others 
And so and so and so and so and so and so 
You'll just have to pray 

If you think your getting away 
I will prove you wrong 
I'll take you all the way 
Stay another song 
I'll blow you all away 
Hey 

It's murder on the dancefloor 
But you better not kill the groove 
It's murder on the dancefloor 
But you better not steal the moves 
DJ, gonna turn this house around somehow 

Repeat chorus 

Don't think you'll get away 
I will prove you wrong 
I'll take you all the way 
Boy, just come along 
Hear me when i say 
Hey 

Repeat chorus (2 times) 

It's murder on the dance floor 
But you'd better not kill the groove
