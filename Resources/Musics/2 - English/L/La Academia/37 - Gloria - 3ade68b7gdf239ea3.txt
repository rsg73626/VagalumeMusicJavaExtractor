GLORIA

Gloria you're always on the run now 
Runnin' after somebody you gotta get him somehow
I think you've gotta slowdown before 
You start to blow it 
I think you're headed for a break down 
So careful not to show it 
You really don't remember 
Was it something that he said or the voices 
In your head calling 
Gloria 

Gloria don't you think you're fallin' ? 
If ev'rybody wants you why isn't anybody calling? 
You don't have to answer leave them hanging on 
The line calling Gloria 

Gloria I think they've got your number 
I think they've got the alias 
That you've been living under 
But you really don't remember 
Was it something that they said or the voices 
In your head calling Gloria 

Gloria how it's gonna go down 
Will you meet him on the main line or 
Will you catch him on the rebound 
Will you marry for the money take a lover 
In the afternoon 
Feel your innocence slipping away; 
Don't believe it's coming back soon 
And you really don't remember 
Was it something that he said or the voices 
In your head calling Gloria. 

Gloria don't you think you're fallin' ? 
If ev'rybody wants you why isn't anybody calling? 
You don't have to answer leave them hanging on 
The line calling Gloria 

Gloria I think they've got your number 
I think they've got the alias 
That you've been living under 
But you really don't remember 
Was it something that they said or the voices 
In your head calling Gloria 

Gloria ... Gloria ... 
Gloria Gloria 
Gloria Gloria
