THE ROSE

Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
and endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
and you it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
that never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
who cannot seem to give
and the soul afraid of dying
that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
and the road has been too long
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
far beneath the bitter snows
lies the seed that with the sun's 
love in the spring becomes the rose
