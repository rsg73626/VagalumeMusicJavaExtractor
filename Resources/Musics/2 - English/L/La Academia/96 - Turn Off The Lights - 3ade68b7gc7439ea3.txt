TURN OFF THE LIGHTS

Its gettin' so lonely inside this bed 
I don't know if I should lick 
My wound or say woe is me instead 
And there's an aching inside 
My head telling me your better off alone 
But after midnight, morning will come 
And the day will see if you will get some 

Chorus: 
They say that girl ya know 
She acts to tough tough tough 
Well its 'til turn off the light 
Turn off the light 
They say that girl ya know 
She acts to rough rough rough 
Well its 'til turn off the light 
Turn off the light 
And I say follow me follow me follow me 
Down down down down till you see all my dreams 
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems 

I looked above the other day 
'Cuz I think I am good and read for a change 
I live my life by the moon 
If its high play it low 
If its harvest go slow but if its full then go 
But after midnight morning will come 
And the day will see if you will get some 

Repeat chorus 

I'm searching for things 
That I just cannot see why don't you don't 
You come and be with me 
I pretend to be cool with me wanna believe 
That I can do without my heart on my sleeve 
I'm running I'm runnin' catch up with me life 
Where's the love that lookin' to find? 
It's all in me 
Why can't you why can't you see that its all in me
