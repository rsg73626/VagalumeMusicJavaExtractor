I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU

If I should stay,
I would onley be on your way.
So I'll go but I know I'll think of you
every step of the way.

And I will always love you.
Will always love you.

You, my darling you. Mmmm.

Bittersweet memories,
That is all I'm Taking with me.
So goodbye, please don't cry.
We both know I'm not what you, you need.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.

I hope life treats you kind, 
And I hope you have
All you've dreamed of.
and I wish to you joy,
And happiness.
But above all this, I wish you love.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you...
I will always love you...
