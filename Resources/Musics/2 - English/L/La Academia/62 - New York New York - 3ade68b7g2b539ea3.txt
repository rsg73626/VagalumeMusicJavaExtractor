NEW YORK NEW YORK

Start spreadin' the news, i'm leavin' today. I want to be a part of it
New York, New York.

These vagabon shoes, are longing to stray, right through the very 
heart of it, New York, New York.

I want to wake up in a city that doesn't sleep. And find i'm King of the
Hill, Top of the Heap.

These little-town blues, are melting away. I'll make a brand new start 
of it in old New York. If I can make it there, i'll make it anywhere.

Its up to you New York, New York.

New York, New York. I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.
And find i'm A-number-1, top of the list. King of the Hill, A-number-1.

These little town blues, are melting away. I'm gonna make a brand new
start of it, in old New York. And, if I can make it there, i'm gonna make 
it anywhere. 

It's up to you New York, New York. New York!
