LOSE MY LOVE

I want to tell u something
But now I'm sacared
If you really love me don't lose my breath away
Sit down there and let me explain 
What I'm feeling now
I wanna throw away everything we had before

Refrao
You're gonna lose my love
This hard way
You're gonna break my heart
And let it fly away
Don´t wanna listen your voice
Look in your eyes
Feel hurt anymore
And see you lose my love

I know that you are murderous
Of my soul
I know what you're thinking now
And i won't
You have to be stronge
To hurt me again
And you'll never see tears of a cry in my life anymore

Refrao
You're gonna lose my love
This hard way
You're gonna break my heart
And let it fly away
Don´t wanna listen your voice
Look in your eyes
Feel hurt anymore
And see you lose my love

Please get out of my live
Don't let me lose my time
If you wanna see me
living, shining, breathing
Just walk away

Refrao
You're gonna lose my love
This hard way
You're gonna break my heart
And let it fly away
Don´t wanna listen your voice
Look in your eyes
Feel hurt anymore
And see you lose my love
