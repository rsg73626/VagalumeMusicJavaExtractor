JAMES BROWN IS DEAD

James Brown is dead…

James Brown is dead…

Mass hysteria, this is techno
House is not my home but it rocks though
I checked up on the late great J.B.
His death is said on national TV
How when, and why this are the main
Things that I heard when I stroll down the lake
Now memory, man are you with that
James Brown is dead…

Total chaos, man it's resurrected
I'm confused that things are gettin' hectic
In my brain, what is happenin'
Could this be a big misunderstanding
It is
The hardest working man in show biz is alive so (???)
Don't be mislead, cause the newsman said
James Brown is dead…

James Brown is dead…

Nightmare is over
Now I'm alone
Grab the mike rip shit an go for broke
Music masterpiece release with this
Now I will get much respect from EmCees


Along the way oh I heard him say
This is fly, this cool type of guy
He's total, and I'm so bad
James Brown is dead…

James Brown is dead.
