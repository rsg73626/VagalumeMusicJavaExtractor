INCREDIBLE

Can't let anybody tell me not to dance
Can't let anybody bring me down
Can't let anybody stand in my way
And nobody's gonna rain on my stage
I'm more than next
I am the now
And if they don't see me
I'll shine brighter
And if they don't hear me
I'll scream a little louder
Until they all take notice
I'm the one in my way
I don't care what they say
And if they don't feel me
I'll push a little harder
They tell me stop dreamin'
I'll shine brighter
Until I decide what has been in my mind
I'm not wastin' my time
I'm not stuntin'
It's just how I move
You should watch me
Cause I'll be
Incredible yeah
Incredible
I'll keep shining
Cause I am
Incredible yeah
Incredible yeah
Heart of a fighter I
Can't be denied don't try
And it's an uphill climb
But when it gets hard I go hard
Gotta chase your dreams and
Believe whats's in your heart
Oh play the hands
We were dealt shuffle your cards
Until you reach the top don't stop
The sky ain't the limit
It's only the beginning
And if they don't see me
I'll shine brighter
And if they don't hear me
I'll scream a little louder
Until they all take notice
I'm the one in my way
I don't care what they say
And if they don't feel me
I'll push a little harder
They tell me stop dreamin'
I'll get a little smarter
Until I decide what has been in my mind
I'm not wastin' my time
I'm not stuntin'
It's just how I move
You should watch me
Cause I'll be
Incredible yeah
Incredible
I'll keep shining
Cause I am
I haven't reached my peak yet
On a winning streak yeah
Don't know how to lose
I'm incredible
Ooh
And if you're with me stay with me
But if you're not with me
It's cool
Ooh
But I suggest you stay humble
Cause humble looks better on you
You can't stop my light from shining
Can't stop my star from rising
I'm incredible
And if they don't see me
I'll shine brighter
And if they don't hear me
I'll scream a little louder
Until they all take notice
I'm the one in my way
I don't care what they say
And if they don't feel me
I'll push a little harder
I'll never stop dreamin'
I'll get a little smarter
Until I decide what has been in my mind
I'm not wastin' my time
I'm not stutin
It's just how I move
You should watch me
Cause I'll be
Incredible yeah
Incredible
I'll keep shining
Cause I am
Incredible yeah
Incredible yeah
