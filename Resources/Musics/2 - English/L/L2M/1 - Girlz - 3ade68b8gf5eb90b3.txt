GIRLZ

Bring on the lights at the stage and the moon too celebrate
We're stick together through whatever hand in hand

Don't need no boys to tell us no
Werent refused to be controlled
We're shooting stars or do your scenes glow

Make it where you want, ya that's the model
Doing our thing like oh oh
Drum what we got like we won the lotto
Girls, come on turn it up and sing along

There's an hour in the noun
Like diamonds in the crowd

Star of the show
