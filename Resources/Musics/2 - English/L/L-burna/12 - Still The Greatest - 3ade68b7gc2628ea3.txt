Hook x4 

[Flesh~N~Bone] 
Now he better lay down 
Test me boy 
I trust my dawgs 
In the name of the Lord 
T-H-U-G 
Were not raised in hell 
Just spray 
With the G-A-G-E 
Smack em with the buck shot 
Guard your face 
Next mornin' 
I read on the front page news 
And o-bit-uary 
You stup[id mothafucka 
Shoulda known not to step to Flesh 
None the less 
He is one less bitch 
For me to worry about 
For the people in time 
I sex my wine 
Hit em up two times 

With a three peice nine 
then dumps the body and 
He's the one got the gun 
With the most of niggas 

Realease the beast 
Nevertheless 
They sleep in silence 
It ain't over for you snitches 

Can't handle the truth 
It hurts punk 
And the next shot 
Off the floor 

Inside his stomach 
Bitch now put em in the mud 
Slowly slowly 
See it inside you 

Open your mind 
Deep in your mental 
Flesh'll get your best 
Shoulda made you realize 

I stay thirsty by the flesh 
It'll be test to try me 
Little bit on the front 
In the aftermath 

When the long gone home 
It ain't shit 
Thought you knew me 
Til I made it known 

Nothin' to pick up the gage 
Explotion blow 
Contest not the Fith Dawg 
Never they know 

Check out my future 
From the second league 
They take out the streets 
Where this thugsta dwell 

All up in St. Clair 
Hit em up S-C-T 
Where them hang 
Niggas trippin' 

Sippin' the fifth of rose 
Everybody buzzed 
Steady remenissin' 
On back and to think how they roll 
Unloaded fo-fo's 

Niiga makin' my money daily double 
It's the reason they call me stack 
That nigga to peel back 
Your mothafuckin cap 

Hook x4
