MY NIGGAZ

(Chorus) 
Stop, stop, everybody what's that sound? 
Ak-47, so you better hit the ground 
Stop, stop, everybody what's that sound? 
Ak-47, nigga get the fuck down! 

(L-Burna) 
Have you kicked it with this thug lately? 
Well, if not, you need to try, 
Baby,look deep into my mind, and you could find just what the game made me 
Rough and rugged, come get this thuggish ruggish rush 
Get a taste of what these bitches just can't touch 
And I be the number one assasin, second to none and steadily blastin' 
All of my niggas that know me ain't askin' what I be doin' to get this cash 
And ?? went out of fashion ?? to get you laid down 
This St. Clair thugsta Bone 
So all of them niggas that's flossin' the industry 
We put one thru your dome 
Nigga, here I go again, thuggish ruggish in the Benz 
Bitches love me with these ends 
Braids blowin' off in the wind 
Tossin' forties out the windows with the top dropped, and my glock cocked 
Little nigga, that block made hot, and i'm that nigga that blew the spot 
Double nine to the 2 tripple zero, millenium hero 
Nigga, I stay right with my people, 'cause these wicked ass streets be lethal 
Niggas is see thru, they transparent, they ghost writin' 
'Cause a nigga like me, i'm tired 
Keep a good reach up on my pile day and night 
It's about that business, nigga, get checked, respect what's mine 
Any you niggas cross the gunline, you can bet that ass is mine 
Nigga, we done sold 30 million plus, who fuckin' with that? 
Nigga, wanna test me and what I represent, i'll fuck you with a rap 
That's why I be tuckin' my strap up under my lap when I get my creep on 
Reason I stress this shit in each song, 
'Cause I mean it when i'm screamin' murda 
Have you ever heard of a nigga that went and got it? 
Got a glock, then really shot it, mothafuckas that's bout it bout it 
Little young niggas that's doin' they thing 
True of game, are Thug Emortalz 
Nigga, don't make me have to force my hand and body 'round your torso 
But of course, hold no remorse for enemies or advasaries 
It be body bags and caskets, skull and bones and cemetaries 

(Chorus)4x 
Stop, stop, everybody what's that sound? 
Ak-47, so you better hit the ground
