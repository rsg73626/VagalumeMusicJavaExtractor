DEADLY MUSICALS

(Chorus)
I keeps one in the chamber,when i'm in danger
Releasin' anger over deadly musicals
And I don't blame ya, I do the dame tah
It ain't in my game tah fuck with none of you groupy ho's
I bring the pain tah, and rearange ya 
And blood stain ya, look at the way we do these ho's 
Lil' Lay'll bang ya, ya pistol slanger 
Ain't been no stranger to fuckin' up these studios 

(L-Burna)
All aboard the mothership up in this bitchand we gon' blast off
Nigga, we gon' smash off
Nigga, my niggas work they ass of (for the third time)
They gettin' paper runnin' with the thug by nature
Nigga, don't make my family break you
Shake you, take you on that other level
My mighty rebel's comin' quick to shoot, to do ya
Blowin' buddah for the love, us come with shit that shock the future
Who the baller now? 
Nigga, where your lady 
And why you can't call her now? 
She runnin' with a thug
And you the scrub with a smaller pile
Mothafuckas better raise up before I put my gauge up
And turn into a deranged nut
Nigga what?
Don't come too close, man 
Don't play the wrong hand
You fuckin' with a grown man
You listen to what the song's sayin'.
Did I hear Bone playin' in your direction? 
Last year you was playa hatin', now you bumpin' Resurrection 
Checkin' chins, tryina bend the wind
Layin' thin in the Benz 
Ballin' for our dividends, nigga what?

(Chorus)

(L-Burna)
Click click, kaboom when I step in the room
You better assume I got that nine milli in my jacket
And i'm thinkin' of visions of doom
I presume with the music
Blazin' right, sho' you right
These are the days of our lives, of our lives
Everyday I get my grind on 
A workaholic whatever you wanna call it 
Nigga Mo Thug be flowin' like flossers, toss it up 
Little lady, shake that ass for Layzie
Like Ken, this shit don't stop baby we doin' this on the daily 
Ay we don't give a fuck and flip out empty the clip out 
Before the po po hit the scene, we dip out
Harass some mo' niggas 
If it's yo' niggas, it's over we comin' thru full throttle 
Mo Thug be the motto, nigga done I roll with Desporitos
E.M.T., Seldom Seen all my thugstas down to roll
Nigga, don't make me call up Bone
And none of my niggas home 
Menenski mobbin' thru the mellenium
Bendin' laws for fun
If you see us thuggin' the hood, better believe I got my gun, son

(Chorus)

(L-Burna)
Now see, I do what I can do
But I can do what you did
And nigga, I know I can build these pyramids
Y'all niggas better take me serious
Here it is mothafucka, your Mo Thug captain
Buckle up prepare for the journey, takin' you mothafuckas platinum
What's happenin' ready for action, satisfaction guarenteed
Movin' at speeds you wouldn't believe
Smokin' on nothin' but trees
Play with the fire, the fire, ya get burned 
Lets go pump the riot, the riot 'til it hurt
We hitmen up for hire, for hire that need work 
Stompin' in the battlezone livin' in the battlefield
Heated heavy for y'all niggas that don't get the picture
We champions, winners rebels for realer
They just don't get the picture
But ya gon' get the picture
It's the mothership

(Chorus)repeat til fade
