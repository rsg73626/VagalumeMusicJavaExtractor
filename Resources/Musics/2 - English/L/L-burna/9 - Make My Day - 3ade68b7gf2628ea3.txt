MAKE MY DAY

You ready to face this whole new millenium ha 
Nigga you raw you aint got no fears ha ha 
Tell me what you gonna do when they be droppin them bombs 
Cause I'm gonna ring me alarm 
try to stick it nigga now you know you got to do me 
Gone try to shoot me 
Or retaliate with this Ozzie got me showed you this is heavens movie 
Watch out nigga I'm gonna knock out any motherfucker 
who thinking that they bout it
Wanna talk about it, do something about it
Them Cleaveland boys get rowdy 
Get buck with me get buck with me
Now you know I'm ready to die for Thugs-N-Harmony
Nigga spark the weed you feeling my Desperados I know

[Chorus: Baby S & L-Burna] 
Niggas on my dick, Niggas wanna come my way 
(hey o hey oowayyy) If you ready to ride then nigga make my day 
Niggas on my dick, Niggas wanna come my way 
(hey o hey oowayyy) If you ready to roll then nigga make my day 

[Baby S] 
Man oh man 
World coming living way bad 
Gotta get me a drink and a new broad 
let me think now I got a bad broad that you pass 
So I download my mind with the icky-sticky-tricky bon bon 
Now I'm ready for whatever what the fuck come 
Im off the chain 
The ear piece platinum Ring 
Had a fake bitch on my team 
But a lemonade two rats now I came back 
with an album sold more than Sting 
And they said he wanna come my way gonna be holy without a day 
You could be about peace on the street aint still gonna put in work. 

[Chorus x2]
 
[L-Burna] 
You a nigga, I'm a nigga, we some niggas
theysome niggas, we gonna be some niggas for Life
im gonna be a richer nigga, can u feel a nigga, dig a nigga.

It's just like rollin a dice 
And at the end of the night 
I be the nigga with the longest braid 
Callin all the shots with the big Gator blocks and the fat knot 

Then they hit the block straight setup shots screaming fuck the cops 
It don't stop till they law down 
Im make a nigga draw down I'm a cock my glock and squeeze 
Put a motherfucker on his knees 

and if he don't believe me get these nuts 
Nigga when I put it down real with my nigga Baby S 
I'll make the whole world damn nigga best 
Better yet I'mma make them holla damn they raw the realest nigga you saw 

Who wanna step to this? 
Aint no thug in the line that could feel these shoes 
I gotta pay my dues 
I got the right to fuck 
If you step on my feet you'll be whippin it off 

I give a fuck about a motherfucker who be liking the boss 
I uppike the cost 
Make em all bow down,way down, niggas wanna test me now 
Im willing to bit I go round for round pound for pound 
See if these worst criminal niggas Got tips on they sleeves 
What about these real cleaveland niggas called SCT's

[Chorus x3]
