THUG BY NATURE

(L-Burna) 
I'm callin' my shots just how I see it, believe it 
My nigga, I G it 
Got a few things that's on my mind 
So nigga gon' listen up while I free it 
Whatever's needed, I'ma get it 
And if I wanna get weeded, I'ma hit it 
All of these dramas, niggas ain't sayin' they did it 
Lil Lay commited (damn right) 
Niggas is bucklin' up under pressure 
Nevertheless still screamin' they thugs 
If crap don't work for the number 1 
I'm packin' my heat, sellin' more drugs 
Ain't a damn thing ceasin, if my bankroll decreasin' 
Open up shop at the first of the month 
nigga, continue my creepin' on a come up 
until I'm done up, dead and gone 
You can look at my life and call me bad 
But nigga, you read me wrong 
And, nigga, I be head over heels 'til I get fifty mill or mo' 
If it's this dough these niggas wanna kill me for 
Well I refuse to be broke 
I'm contemplatin' murder on the government 
Desporito be the motto 
All shit be hard to swallow be ready for war if you follow 
Atend hut, two, three, fo' 
Soldiers get your paper 
Nigga, you die if you a hater 
Take it from a thug by nature, by nature 

(Chorus)x4 
Cause I'm a thug by nature, thug by nature, yeah, yeah 
(Gotta keep thuggin', we're thuggin', thuggin', thuggin') 
(Livin' the life of a thug, thug, thug) 

(L-Burna) 
Now, it's a few rules to the game 
By now, I'm thinkin' everybody should know 
Number one when you get your paper 
Don't go around trickin' it off on these ho's 
God bein' a thug ain't nothin' easy 
Now, when you rollin' in a Benz 
Everybody be out for your ends 
You really don't know who the fuck your friends 
And paranoia might overrule ya 
But look to the future, don't blink 
Nigga, and your ship might sink 
Endin' up dead or in the clink 
And it take a raw dog 
Mothafucka, to stay on top of the pile 
Now, I got a style and you got a style 
But is the weight gon' pull you down? 
Not me, I'm blowin' pounds 
I see a cloud that's how I do it 
Picture me rollin' thru a city near you 
And stayin' true to it 
Nigga, you seen me in the video 
I know you seen me at the bar 
Seen my diamonds glisten and shinnin' 
And you thinkin' I'm a star 
But nigga, by far I'm just a thug 
Mission sharper than a razor 
When you on the go, lil' Lay gon' take ya 
I'm a thug by nature, by nature 

(Chorus)x4 
Cause I'm a thug by nature, thug by nature, yeah, yeah 
(Gotta keep thuggin', we're thuggin', thuggin', thuggin') 
(Livin' the life of a thug, thug, thug) 

(L-Burna) 
Roll, come and roll with me 
As I take you on a journey thru my hood, mothafucka! 
You can hear the police sirens blazin' 
After these niggas that's paper chasin' 
Throwin' house parties in the basement 
How niggas doin' it in the wasteland 
Nigga, get down and dirty quickly 
Really, did he wanna commit that crime? 
One for all my nigga, we had to grind 
We had to get down for our crimes 
Mental mindstate about money 
Murder and bitches, to say the less 
Even I know it ain't good to stress 
These wicked streets really a test for all niggas 
My niggas, y'all niggas be ready to ball 
Niggas ready for war for when we call niggas 
Talkin' about them raw niggas 
Throw your fist up take a chance 
Niggas is hustlin' out here, gettin' it 
What you tryin' to do, I did it 
How you tryin' to live, I done lived it 
I only be fuckin' around with major moves 
Niggas done heard the stories 
If your shit ain't tight then I played you fools 
You losin' to get the glory 
That's straight up and down 
Nigga, pound for pound, round for round 
We can make this happen 
Niggas be snappin', guarenteed satisfaction 
Bringin' y'all nothin' but action 
Nigga this here is what the game made me 
But Layzie, I'm just a thug, and that's the thang to be, to be 
Nigga this here is what the game made me, made me 
I'm just a thug, and that's the thang to be, to be 

(Chorus)x4 
Cause I'm a thug by nature, thug by nature, yeah, yeah 
(Gotta keep thuggin', we're thuggin', thuggin', thuggin') 
(Livin' the life of a thug, thug, thug)
