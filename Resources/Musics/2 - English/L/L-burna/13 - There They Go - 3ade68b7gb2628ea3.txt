THERE THEY GO

Livin' legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin'
It's all platinum, we make it happen
Livin' legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin'
It's all platinum, we make it happen
Look here, playa I make this money
Nah, this money ain't make me
And you better believe that you outta your mind
Thinkin' you gon' try to play me
Lately Layzie been grindin'
Member that thug about perfect timin'
Dropin' that heat that you keep rewindin'
Comin' outta the cut, look who's shinin'
L Burna, L Dog, lil' Lightnin's a go-getter
Still claimin' St. Clair wig splitters
Ain't wastin' no time with them bullshitters
I'm a heavy hitter, and the game don't wait
So I gotta get down for my thang
Let the whole world know who run this thang
Bone Thugs, and it just don't change
I'm the crook that wrote the book
Showed y'all niggas how to really get it off the hook
Better do your thang, and I'ma do my thang
Better open your eyes and just look
You'll see me ballin' on you bitches
Livin' life flawless with the riches
Mo Thugs'll kick the real shit
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness, can I get a witness?
Nigga, Little Lay'll get a broad
to make all of these ballers in the club wanna shake it
Back it on up to the zipper and break it
Til the thugs on the floor can't take this
Show me love, pump your fists
And when it get like this it's crackin'
For all the G's in the house, better chief tonight
Y'all already know what's happenin'

(Chorus - 4X)
There they go, there they go
Wanna let then nigggas know
They don't wanna fuck with me
