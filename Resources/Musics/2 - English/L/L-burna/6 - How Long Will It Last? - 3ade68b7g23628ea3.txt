HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?

(Chorus)x8 
How long, how long will it last?
I know I'm lost, how long will it last?

(L-Burna)
It's on and crackin' right about now
Cause I'm on my own two feet
Moved outta my mama's house for good
And now I'm addicted to the streets
It's fast livin', that's what I was bread for
Reason my niggas keep fallin' down
Livin' locked up in the jail cell
But oh well, 'cause it's 3-C callin' out
Nigga, wild as a juvinile 
Big ballin' to feed my destiny 
Had to get up, get out, and get somethin'
Nigga, 'cause ain't nobody helpin' me
Nigga was fourteen in '89
Shoulda seen little Layzie grind 
If a nigga came short, he gave me mine
It was all about the scrilla, nigga 
Real niggas like you know
My big nigga here know 
We was on the block sellin' chop chops with Wally and Lorenzo
It was a school of real livin'
And that's where a nigga learned to survive
Learned my tactics to stay alive before I was old enough to drive 
Comin' from a family of thieves
Nigga tried to live the Scarface dream 
But I guess everything ain't what it seems 
Idolize them niggas on TV screens 
But I had to have it, after mathmatics
I continued smashin'
More niggas zipped up in plastic
Nigga, how long will it last? 

(Chorus)x8 
How long, how long will it last?
I know I'm lost, how long will it last?

(L-Burna)
And it wasn't long before a nigga got cuffed up
Cuffed up, roughed up by the po po
And them pussy ass cops that took me down 
I guess they was after my mojo
I kept my mouth closed and eyes open
Waitin' for the day they release me 
With this game still runnin' thru my veins
Nigga, my love for the streets ran deeply thru the blood
Mental thug
Nigga, this shit didn't come from no rappin'
It came from minglin' in the hood 
Straight up to no good, fightin' and scrappin'
Back on the scene, where I belong 
Damn near everything goin' wrong
My lyrics for life is to be my song
Nigga took a hot one to the dome
But I made it thru and got heated heavy
Packin' pistols to protect my corner
On the foul nigga, you's a goner 
Mothafucka better peep my persona
That's when the hood broke into sections
Jackin' these niggas for what it's worth
No nigga, your terf is my terf
As long as I run this earth
And it's about that murder
Nigga, and gun play from monday nigga 'til sunday
If you want me
Nigga, come get me
Lettin' off rounds, comin' up from one way
My lady said baby chill nigga, you movin' too fast
And I told the girl, I gotta get this cash
I don't know how long it's gon' last

(Chorus)x8 
How long, how long will it last?
I know I'm lost, how long will it last?

(L-Burna)
I guess it don't stop up in this bitch
Cause nigga, the plot keep gettin' thicker
All it is it's about these figgas
Nigga, just fuck with your little nigga
I made a few moves to get out the ghetto
Advance to a whole new other level
Now we Mo Thug mighty rebels
Nigga, we toatin' deadly metals
Puttin' the pedal to the floor
Mashin' 'til 3 thousand and fo'
If it ain't about no money what the fuck you in this fo' 
Better pack your shit and be ready to roll
Or get rolled over 
Told ya Lightnin' will learn ya 
Either duckin' to L Burna 
Better mind your business if it don't concern ya
Multi platinum Mo Thug
Nigga, we a raw ass dynasty
I'ma show you how Cleveland's finest be 
Y'all punk mothafuckas keep eyein' me,despisin' me
Wanna ride with me get high with me, but won't die for me
Y'all punk mothafuckas can't roll
This on some real shit

(Chorus)repeat til fade
How long, how long will it last?
I know I'm lost, how long will it last?
