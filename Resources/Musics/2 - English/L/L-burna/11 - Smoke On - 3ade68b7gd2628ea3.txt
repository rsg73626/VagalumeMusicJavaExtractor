Nigga, this my life
And I'm livin' the high life 
And I love to smoke
And it really don't be right
If my weed ain't tight
Like a nigga might as well be broke
But quote me a price
And drop my sack
Quickly 
You wanna smoke with me
Drop me a ???
With a philly
It really don't matter to me
'Cause I'm green leafin'
Big chiefin'
I'm making my thang
To blaze
Who the lover to this game
And man I'm not ever gonna change my ways
And in the morning when I rise I'm gettin' high
Even off in the evening
When I'm rollin' 
I'm smokin' ligh (smoking ligh)
Trying to free my mind
If you want to parly
Just jump your ass in the trunk
Pull out the blunt
Then light it on up
Lay it on back 
And and get fucked up
As soon as you hit it
You hear your heart beat thumping
Stick be numming
Mint keep humming
Music bumping
Try to fall off into something
Whatever it be
Just let it be known
This weed be the dro
'Cause nigga it be slow for the po
I know
That's why niggas stay on the go
Smoking the leanest (the leanest)
Smoking the greenest
If you wanna get blowed
You can hit me
Little Lay be through a little later 
On the sticky
The sticky

When you wanna get blowed
They all know
You can call on L-A-Y
For the hyrdo
Lah Lah Lah Lay
Lah Lah Lah Lay (for the doe)
Yah Yah
(Lah Lah Lah Lay) When you wanna get blowed
You all know
You can call on L-A-Y
For the hyrdo
Lah Lah Lah Lay
Lah Lah Lah Lay (for the doe)
Lil' Lay Lay (that is)

Nigga hit the studio
And drop a song
And then I get gone
In the wind
See my nigga, Ken, 
Then dipped the Benz
And copped two old folks for the Ben
Then decided to meet downtown
By ten
Shoot a little pool and sip some gin
Gave it a little set bet
And then made a little bet about who would win
Continue smashing
A nigga been on the road and need (I need some) some action
I'm headed back to the hood
'Cause nigga the hood is really what's happening
Been in a lot of hoods
In a lot of cities
But this one here is mine
I remeness 
And make a wish
As I pass that "99 street" sign
Hit up the liquor store
'Cause I'm fixing to blow big
With the niggas on the block
Nigga going to smoke
Smoke a lot
Let them feel this dro
That Lay just got
Nigga hit the block
About Four
And didn't leave until nine
Watching my niggas out on the grind
I didn't notice the time
Find myself flying down to the crib
Trying to meet Ken in a hurry
Doing about fifty in ???
Running lights with no worries
I made it there safe and on time
When I pulled to the spot
And I see Ken chillin'
Smoking in the parking lot
(Let me hit it)

Roll up that hyrdo
And just smoke on
Smoke on
I'll roll this blunt for you (Lah Lah Lah Lay)
Lah Lah Lah Lay
uh huh
And just smoke on
Smoke on (Lah Lah Lah Lay)
I'll roll this blunt for you (Lah Lah Lah Lay)

Nigga left the pool hall
Sloppy and didn't even fuck with nobody
And all this kicking then got me paranoid
Hoping the po po don't stop me
Doing the limit with L
So high that I'm nervous as hell
Fuck waking up sober in jail
Hit fifty fit for some shell
And I drop the top so the wind 
Can blow on through my braids
All in my face
Get on my way
And right about then I get a page
Who could it be
Its Hey lil' Nappy
And had a head full of some sin
Told me to come on over there
Quick
'Cause I got the booze and no more weed
Tell him its on
Hung up the phone
Fixing to start this whole new section
Less then fifteen to twenty minutes
I drove
And lil' Lay then bless them
That's how it is 
When they roll with the number one
That's how it be 
Nothing but icky-sticky leaves
Trees that will put you on your knees
Hit it
Then hold it 'til it make you cough and gag
Guaranteed to run and and brag
To your niggas about lil' Layzie bag
I keep the killing
Nigga can smoke and p.o.
If you can catch up with me
Or you can hit me 
And I be through with the sticky
The sticky
