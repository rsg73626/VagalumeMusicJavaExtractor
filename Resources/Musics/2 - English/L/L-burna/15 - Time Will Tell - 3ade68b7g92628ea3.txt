TIME WILL TELL

It's all about perfect timin', feel me! 
I said, it's all about perfect timin', feel me! 
Nigga, it's all about perfect timin', feel me! 
Puttin' it down 'til these mothafuckas kill me! 

(Ken Dawg) & L-Burna x4 
(It's like, time will tell, time will tell) 
For me to prevail and capitalize on this mail 
Look at the seven on my stomach, don't run from it 
Battles you scared of a nigga that done really done it 

(L-Burna) 
Nigga, this hustlin' thang ain't knew to me 
See, what it do for me 
I keeps it crackin' and poppin', and droppin' 
The fact this shit that's always chart toppin' 
Feelin' my legacy, don't step to me never 
Nigga done took you on that other level 
I war with the devil just one of them mighty rebels 
I passed the game out, figured a way to get my name out 
Now they ask me what this fame 'bout 
Little kids wanna go the same route 
If they can be like lil' Layzie they would 
But it's thug or die comin' up in the hood 
It's all the same, homie
from the north, to the south, to the east, to the west 
Better protect that chest and keep it peacefull where you rest 
And God bless 
If I have to protect my family I will 
May Lord have mercy on your soul when it's the time to kill 
Let time reveal 
And I bet they tell a story is at 
And I put my city on the map 
Nigga, I attack with rap 
World wide thugish ruggish, ruggish, riggish, ruggish, ruggish, ruggish 
World wide thugish ruggish, ruggish, riggish, ruggish, ruggish, ruggish 

(Ken Dawg) & L-Burna x2 
(It's like, time will tell, time will tell) 
For me to prevail and capitalize on this mail 
Look at the seven on my stomach, don't run from it 
Battles you scared of a nigga that done really done it
