CONNECTIN THE PLOTS

(Chorus)x2 
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl 
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all 
Niggas heavy in the game 
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots 

(W.C.) 
Move back homie as I pump my Chevy up 
Mash and hit the gas 
Fly my bandana up outta the window 
And left her ass on the smash 
Maniac mission, dippin', sqrew-job intermission you're bangin' for mine 
From the west to the east to the nine, nine 
Bow down bustas ain't no bannin' me 
Now I'm back, and I'ma walk on with Layzie and the Mo Thug family 
Dub-C, C-Dub rippin', trippin', click, click 
I loaded the clip in with my eighty gauge 
Twistin', got you bitch niggas ticked 
And move and walk up outta the kitchen 
Conect-gang and Mo Thugs, some real nigga collision 
Rollin' 'til the wheels fall off pullin' my penis 
Throwin' up the dub so much that I got atheritis in my fingers 
Ride and rhyme, and get her high with illegal ???? bread 
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of the ghetto heisman 
With them thangs in the dash 
Nigga, we bang for the cash 
Steadily aimin' for that ass 
Burnin' them thangs when I blast, nigga! 

(Chorus)x2 
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl 
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all 
Niggas heavy in the game 
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots 

(L-Burna) 
You see the connection when I be flexin' 
Nigga, better move in the other direction 
Choose your weapon and make a selection 
Cause nigga we runnin' you outta your section 
Ain't no question who it be, little Layzie Bone and Dub-C 
Nigga, we ride with the gangsta gangsta 
Niggas, Cube and Eaz
