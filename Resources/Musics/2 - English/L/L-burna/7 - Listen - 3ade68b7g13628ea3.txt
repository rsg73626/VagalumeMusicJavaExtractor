LISTEN

[Verse 1]
I hit the scene with another persuasion
A criminal invastion
Nigga thats what I'm workin with
Is it my fault or your fault
This world got me goin awol
Whatever the case may be you better believe lil lay play yall hey yall
This ain't the endin it's really just beginnin
Grinnin lord forgive my sinnins and we are can come up winnin
I'm determined to make this work
Just hopin my music makes a difference
A change for better thangs
But most of all a better way
You know we pray and we pray and we pray like every day
But I think we need a little more faith
From across the word of my shoulder
A nigga is gettin older
And everyday I'm out here gettin closer to go

[Chorus]
Momma listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

Brother listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

Burn listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it feels like a niga be talkin the wind
Late night when I'm in my Benz
Thinkin bout my homies in the pin
And my layin in bed and tucked in
And properly fed
Ima make it baby even if I have to bone wit bed
See I ain't worried bot the scrilla cause Ima go getta
A street livin thug nigga by night you should get the picture
Ima a acquir what I quin
Inspired by the pain
You can't retire from the game 
When you got everything to gain can you
I'm leavin on the next plain
I don't know when I'll be back again
Trust me and wait for me
I'm hopin everything will be the same
I'm leavin on the next plain
I don't know when I'll be back again
Trust me and wait for me
I'm hopin everything will be the same

[Chorus]
Bone listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

Mo thug listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

[Verse 3]
If I ain't here with you right now
My nigga I'm with you in the heart
How it was just from the start
Y'all know we ain't never gonna fall apart
We know the art of wa
And we pssin it to our children
Yall really don't believe when we say its veary as we real it
Pump your first
You can resist
This thug shit we got to offer
Mo sext just might cost ya
Better pin with the lord who brought ya nigga
I know your moma taught you better than that
And when its cold outside put on a coat and a hat fool

[Chorus]
Momma listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

Brother listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

Burn listen I'm on a mission for my future
If you new the new the was I perssure the common shoot
That you would listen, but you can't hear me
So I guess I'm going solo I'm still living

[Talking]
And the moral of the story is 
All for one, one for all
Yo lil nigga signin out, till next time nigga
