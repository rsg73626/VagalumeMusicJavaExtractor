LOCK-N-LOAD

(Chorus)x3 
Nigga, it's all about the drama 
Packin' pistols when we ride 
Mothafuckas about to die 
It's about to be some shit! 

(L-Burna) 
I'm talkin' 'bout cats in the worst way 
Nigga, put it on my birth 'til my hurse lay, right 
Nigga, know about Illuminati and they new world order 
Nigga, Mo Thug finest runnin' through the mind 
And, nigga don't pint the science behind the violence 
Call me that mighty rebel makin' moves in silence 
Livin' life timeless 
Nigga, I be constantly rollin' with the devil on every level 
It's a battle war ain't nothin' but a cosmic law 
Competition and money to keep the shit raw 
Rich stay rich and the poor take off 
My nigga, it's the '99 
Niggas is out here dyin' getttin' down for they crime 
Crime suspect on the string like a puppet, warriors on the frontline 
Sometimes it'll make a real thug nigga wonder how we don't go under 
Livin' in the last days 
I be killin' tryin' to get that million 
Better be lucky this mothafuckin rap pays 
What'cho gonna do when it come for you? 
I'ma tell you right now what my thugs gon' do 
We gon' lace our boots, and stand ready to shoot 
Kill up all them mothafuckin' boys in blue 
No reguards for authorities 
Try to dump a nigga up with the Thorazine 
You invited to the bloody, bloody horror scene 
Know what I mean see you ain't on my team 
Nigga, if you sets then mark the target 
Who the fuck you think they huantin'? 
Make a mothafucka think dauntin' 
Truely yours, America's most wanted 

(Chorus)x4 
Nigga, it's all about the drama 
Packin' pistols when we ride 
Mothafuckas about to die 
It's about to be some shit! 

(L-Burna) 
Nigga, since I started this shit 
Then I'ma finish this shit 
Real St. Clair niggas up in this bitch 
Bustin' round after round 'til I empty the clip 
I do my dirty and dip, so don't trip, and I flip 
Musta been the cause for the action 
Reason why a mothafucka had to get checked 
Nigga, when I step on the set 
Then i'll be willing to bet 
It's going down in the name of threat 
This isn't a promise 
I'm the bombest mothafuckin' nigga that you gotta compete with 
It ain't no secret to our freaky 
Keep this raw, uncut for the streets shit 
Peep this game from the nigga from Cleveland 
Been around the globe 
Did a few shows, and I fucked a few ho's 
Made a lotta dough, and I'm itchin' for mo' 
So, too many niggas be envious 
Wanna hate on the nigga with the benjamins 
Tryin' to plot on another nigga dividends 
Though the life we live gets strenuous 
And we gettin' it how me and my niggas 
We outrang hustlas, thug by nature 
It's all about paper, fuck these haters 
Everytime a nigga makes moves, it's major 
Pager blowin' up, and nigga my celly off the hinges 
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' business 
Rollin' in Bentlys, Jags and Benzs 
Nigga for the two triple zero, represent new millenium heros 
And just like Bone Thug rolls 
Little Lay gon' keep on kickin' in doors 

(Chorus)x4 
Nigga, it's all about the drama 
Packin' pistols when we ride 
Mothafuckas about to die 
It's about to be some shit! 

(L-Burna) 
My stuff is in motion, lock and load 
Nigga better tell 'em 'bout the gunline, boss 
Cause nigga, you cross it, you leakin' like a faucet 
Remember we take no shorts or no losses 
Play a nigga hard 
Cause we're marchin' through the darkness 
Could it be the light at the end of the tunnel? 
Plus we animals in this jungle 
Prayin' on the victims, livin' life gung-ho 
I don't know, and Layzie don't give a fuck 
Platinum nigga, and I still'll bust 
While I'm here, nigga I'm gon' live it up 
Keep puttin' this down and won't give it up 
Is it real or what? 
Why you wanna judge me? 
Nigga better mind his perogitives 
So you gotta give, takin' hostages 
Ain't none of y'all mothafuckas gotta live 
Whatever plot this is I'm playin' my role 
Told you before ain't no bitch in my song 
Did I mention I roll with the uzi 
I bet you got instruments, just click on you ho's 
Bombin' on you fake niggas 
How much of this bullshit you willin' to take, nigga? 
Say we eliminate and we erase these niggas 
Weed out these niggas, and break these niggas 
Y'all ready for the thug world order? 
I'm ready to ride 
Nigga, lets do this 
For the Mo Thug, 7th Sign, Thugline 
For the love of Eazy, it's Ruthless 
And the truth is nigga, we run this thang 
Nigga better duck when the gun go bang 
Forever i'll be thuggin' for the love of the game 
And it ain't gon' change 
Nigga, lets go hang 

(x2) 
To all my thugs and hustlas down to ride 
To all my thugs and hustlas on the line 
(It's about to be some shit!) 
To all my thugs and hustlas down to ride 
To all my thugs and hustlas lock n load, lock n load 
(It's about to be some shit!)
