TAKE TO THE SKY

Pack my pipa full of grieffa
Just like my woman
I could never leave her, cheat her, need her
So I take a puff and another puff
Exhale, then I take a breather
Cause I'll take my time and do it right
I know where I'll be tonight
Clouding the night in my mind
Feelin' fine, this is mine
You wanna get high?
Well come back another time
When you really want to fly
Cause I plan to take it to the point
Where I don't know my name
Won't even know where I'm at
But want to come back
To this place, where I sit
Rather your lips will take a hit
Prepare for licked, bring the pipe
Or a spliff I hit is swiff
God's gift, to this world, got me in a twirl
In a whirl, everything I see is plural
I'm just blazing, hallucinating
And I can't lie, smoking crepa chocolate tie
Lemon teardrops falling from my eye
Take to the sky, on my natural high
Till the day I die

{chorus}
High till I die
I wanna get high, so high
High on the natural high

{Lil' Rob}
I can smoke it on my own
Never leave me alone
I'm in my zone
Stoned to the bone
Me in the dark, sittin' in the park
Forgettin' everything that hurts my heart
So I spark another joint, what's the point?
Escape from reality, into a fantasy
That's sexuality, feel the passion
When the smoke is passin'
Everlastin' type of bud
When I smoke my buds
Takes me to a place
Smile upon my face
Cause she sets me free
From the things I see
Let me be somebody, hear my plea
It's only me, I'd rather be lonely
Roll it on my own, cause I hold my own
Toke it on my own, used to think of dyin'
Now I think of flyin', like I've never flown
Spread my wings and fly
Why lie? It's something that I can't deny
Take to the sky, on my natural high
Till the day I die

{chorus}
High till I die
I wanna get high, so high
High on the natural high

{Lil' Rob}
Life is like a maze
Got's me in a craze
So I hide away in marijuana's maze
Change my evil ways
Stayin' half a day
Captured in the rapture
Love the way she plays
Got's me feelin' very loose
Dizziness, love it when I feel like this
I'm real like this, smokin' all this flavored shit
It's time to call it quits
But once again my lighter flicks
And I take another puff
Just can't get enough
Of this happiness
Smoking canibus
Devotion to my potent potions
What I've chosen, love it when my time is frozen
Gots me in that motion, like I'm close to floatin'
Takin' to the sky, when I want to fly
And I'm sittin' on my cloud, like Joe Buton
Don't stop now, la grafepa gone, and I'm gone
It's the wicked, slicked, slide, type a guy
With, it's something that you can't deny
Take to the sky, on your natural high
Till the day you die

{chorus}
High till I die
I wanna get high, so high
High on the natural high

Ooooo
Check this out
Lil' Rob
Pass me another one
Feels so good, feels so good
Up in my chest
No stress, no stress
Smoking on Mary
Ooooo, I wanna get high, so high
Ooooo, so high, so high, so high
On the natural high
