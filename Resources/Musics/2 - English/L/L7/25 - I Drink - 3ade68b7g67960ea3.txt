I DRINK

I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face
All my friends tell me i'm a basket case
I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face

I got so drunk
I don't remember what happened
But everybody said
I had a real good time

I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face
All my friends tell me i'm a basket case
I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face

Went to a bar
I met a guy, he bought me white Russians
I puked outside in the parking lot
While he tried to kiss me

Seein' blurry
Talkin' slurry
Feelin' queasy
This is sleazy

I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face
All my friends tell me i'm a basket case
I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face

I went for drinks in Hollywood
Came to somewhere in Hawthorne
Broke up a bush, drove into a tree
And rolled down a hill with my mouth wide open

Seein' blurry
Talkin' slurry
Feelin' queasy
This is sleazy
