DEATHWISH

She wakes up wet in a shower stall
Sewn together, bangs her head on a wall
She goes hitchhiking at 3 a.m.
Bruised and bloody, does it over again 

She's got a deathwish
In a self-destructive blitz 

He's got a car that goes real fast
He's got a life but it won't last
Doesn't even look disturbed
When his Chevy takes out the curb 

He's got a deathwish
Coming home is a hit or a miss
He's got a deathwish
In a self-destructive blitz 

Passed out drunk on the living room floor
Gets up and pukes so she can drink some more
And evening's party out in the fringe
Turns into a two-week binge 

She's got a deathwish
Coming home is a hit or a miss
She's got a Deathwish
In a self-destructive blitz
