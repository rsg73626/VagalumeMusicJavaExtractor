PACKIN' A ROD

I'm all fucked up and i'm mad as hell
Violate your daughter
And your son as well
I don't give a shit about your crummy lie
As long as I'm god, i'm packin a rod
Yeah 

I'm packin' a rod
I'm packing a rod
I'm packin' a rod, baby
And it's all for you 

GUNS AND AMMO is what i read
My cold steel dagger's gonna make you bleed
When you talk to me
You best watch what you say
My Smith and Wesson heat
Is gonna blow you away 

And it's all for you
Packin' a rod
