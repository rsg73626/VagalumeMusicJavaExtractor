FREEZER BURN

Freezer burn watch you thaw
Suck it in, big guffaw
Freezer burn, shut your mouth
I know what your braying about
Freezer burn
All my life, once bit twice
Freezer burn watch you pose
Roll my eyes, hold my nose
Freezer burn shut your mouth 
I know what your yelping about, 
Freezer burn
Patience in vain, you'll never change
All my life, once bit twice
