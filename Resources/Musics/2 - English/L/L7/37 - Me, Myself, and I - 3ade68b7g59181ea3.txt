ME, MYSELF, AND I

Me myself and I
Will never be lonely
As long as I
Stick together
Like glue
Without you

I lie here on the couch
Thinking about potatoes and me
And I realize
Destined to be French fries

Me myself 
Me myself and I

My shipâ€™s been tossed about
Have some decency
The only friends Iâ€™ve got left
Are my idiosyncrasies

Me myself
