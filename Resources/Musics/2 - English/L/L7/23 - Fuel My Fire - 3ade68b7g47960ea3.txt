FUEL MY FIRE

I've got a word of thanks 
Thanks that i'd like to say 
For the rage that i feel 
For the rage that i feel today 
Gotta stack gotta stack 
Stack of chips on my shoulder 
In everything i do 
Cause i made i made i made 
The mistake, the mistake of trusting you 

People like you just fuel my fire 
People like you just fuel, yeah 

My layers are thick 
And i got a bad attitude 
Yeah that knife in my back 
Has fingerprints that belong to you 
Gotta grudge gotta grudge gotta grudge 
That i'm holding for you 
As long as i live 
'Cause you lied you lied you lied 
And that's something that i can't forgive 
You liar 

People like you just fuel my fire 
People like you just fuel, yeah
