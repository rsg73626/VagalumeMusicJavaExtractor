BAGGAGE

I'm lookin' old today 
In a very sort of jaded way 
Very cynical and hard 
Weeds all over my yard 
I can't remember the summer 
It's all a blur, yeah 
It's been pilin' high 
It's been pilin' up so goddamn high 

Now I've got baggage 

I'm probably tagged for life 
My self-righteous eyes 
Wanna close the book 
It's got nothing to do with the looks 
Can't keep it together, losing my grip 
Yeah, i've been sinking down 
Time to abandon ship 

It's hard to swim with baggage 

My friends are all strangers 
They stopped calling weeks ago 
But guilt's a heavy load 
It's a very very heavy load 

Packed in my baggage
