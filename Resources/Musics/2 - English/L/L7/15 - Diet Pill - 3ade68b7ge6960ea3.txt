DIET PILL

My diet pill is wearing off
My diet pill is wearing off

Cos Victor's in the bed
Sewn in the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red

Calgon can't take me away
No, Calgon can't take me away
From the things that I did today

Cos Victor's in the bed
Sewn in the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red

I'm outta here
I'm so outta here
I'm outta here

I think the swelling is going down
I said I think that the swelling is going down
Two hundred dollars to leave this town

Cos Victor's in the bed
Sewn in the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red
I'm outta here
I'm so outta here
