FREAK MAGNET

Liars, losers, coming at me 
What i need is sanctuary 
Minding my own business 
Getting in my face 
Violating my personal space 

Freak magnet 
Jerk appeal 

Something about you 
Is so not right 
Nightmare, nightmare 
In the daylight 
Asking for my number 
You wanna give me a call 
But i've got your message 
Written on the wall 

Freak magnet 
Jerk appeal 

Always bugging me 
Why don't you get a clue 
'Cause i don't want to 
Talk to you 
I know that look in your eye 
I've seen it before 
I've given you all of my change 
But you want something more 

Freak magnet
