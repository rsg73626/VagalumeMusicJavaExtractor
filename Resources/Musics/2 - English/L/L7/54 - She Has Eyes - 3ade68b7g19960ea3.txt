SHE HAS EYES

I am sick of her attacks 
Can't help but i've fallen back 
I believe in what she says 
I rent space in her head 

She has eyes made for crying 

When she can't lie to get approved 
Lost time and far removed 
Can't afford to keep it used 
I'm getting ready to lose 
She has eyes made for crying 

When she hits those hits are so hard 
Weeping is her first playing card 
And i believe she believes 
In what she says 
This is my last time in her head
