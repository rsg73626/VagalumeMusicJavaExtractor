AMERICAN SOCIETY

Don't wanna drown
Don't wanna be found
This is not my destiny
Oh yeah
No twentieth century casualty
Oh yeah 

I don't wanna watch television
I don't wanna listen to the radio
I don't wanna drown in American society 

Don't wanna be rich
Now can't you see the way they dress
They dress
Well they're a bloody tax mess
I don't wanna go to the movies
I don't wanna listen to the company
