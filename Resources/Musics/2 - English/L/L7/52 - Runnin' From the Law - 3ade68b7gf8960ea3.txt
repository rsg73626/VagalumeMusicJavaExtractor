RUNNIN' FROM THE LAW

Playing rock and roll
On a Friday night
A noise complaint
Turned into a fight
The neighbors were loud
It disturbed our crowd
We played some more
And they stormed the door

We didn't do nothing
Hey hey hey...
But now we're running
And hiding

Cops got on stage
And they pulled my hair
Kicked 'em in the balls
(?)
The fans in mind
It shows how they find
You can call me a tramp
don't unplug my amp

We didn't do nothin'
Hey hey hey
But now we're runnin'
And hidin'

Runnin' from the law
Runnin'
