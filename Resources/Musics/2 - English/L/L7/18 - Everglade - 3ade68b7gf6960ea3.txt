EVERGLADE

Glade told her ma, "Home scene's lame"
"I gotta go head into town, blow some steam at the rock show"
Sneak through the back door and head for the pit
Then some drunk, stupid loser started giving her shit

Redneck's on parade
Don't cross my line
Says Everglade
Everglade

He was whipping through the pit
Knocked her into the stage
She said, "Have your fun,
But stop being so lame."
This guy was drunk, stupid
And he must have weighed a ton
Said, "Get out of here girly,
I'm just trying to have some fun."

So you wanna have some fun
Well, break out the big guns
Redneck's on parade
Don't cross my line
Says Everglade
Everglade

He kept it up, his fists started flying
They dodged each punch, as he kept trying
Tripped on his own feet and hit the floor
Glade got to pushing and rolled him out the door
So you wanna have some fun?
Well break out the big guns
Rednecks on parade
Don't cross my line
