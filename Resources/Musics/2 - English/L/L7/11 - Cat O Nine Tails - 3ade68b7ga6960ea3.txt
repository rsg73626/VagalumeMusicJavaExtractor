CAT O NINE TAILS

Cat-o-nine-tails
Cat-o-nine lives
Little pussy purrs, hold her tight and she's yours

Think I'm allergic and I don't know why
Think I'm allergic and it makes me cry

You're scratchin' me baby
Right down to my heart
Now claw the couch now that we're apart

Think I'm allergic and I don't know why
Think I'm allergic and it makes me cry

I love you baby
And i don't mean to hound
But they're chasin' my heart
Now that you're not around

Think I'm allergic and I don't know why
Think I'm allergic and it makes me cry

Cat-o-nine tails
