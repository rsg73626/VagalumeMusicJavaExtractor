TALK BOX

Last night i had a dream 
It scared the shit out of me 
'Cause you were dying 
Yeah you were dying 

And everyone was around 
And you were on the ground 
And everyone was around 

Dying, you were dying 

Last night i had a dream 
It scared the shit out of me 
'Cause you were dying 
Yeah you were dying 

And you were all alone you were all alone 
You were by a phone 
But you were all alone 

Last night i had a dream 
It scared the shit out of me 
'Cause you were dying 
Yeah you were dying 

And your friends were there 
And all your friends were there 
In your underwear 
And all your friends were there 
And you were dying
