LITTLE ONE

I know your scared and little uptight
Things just have not been right
Be alright, It'll be alright
We're gonna have fun tonight, yeah
My little one
A lot of shit is on your mind
Blow it off there ain't much time
The road is rocky and painfully slow
Just crack the whip and go, go, go, go
