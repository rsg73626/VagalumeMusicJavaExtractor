DRAMA

Wah Wah
One and one is two
Bring on the drama
I'm watching TV 
ans i don't need you
We got a drama
I'll tell you something and you know it's true
You're full of drama
My piss is yellow and the sky is blue
We got a drama
Spare me
You're draining me
Wah Wah
One and one is two
Bring on the drama
There's something wrong yeah I agree
We got a drama
I'll tell you something 
you're choking me
With all your drama
Life stinks and the grass is green
We got a drama
Spare me 
You're draining me, draining me..
