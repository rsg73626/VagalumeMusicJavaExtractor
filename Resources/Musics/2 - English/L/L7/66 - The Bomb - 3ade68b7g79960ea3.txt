THE BOMB

Plastic people with their plastic lives 
Plastic lips tell plastic lies 
Plastic drivers in plastic cars 
Plastic food from plastic jars 

Frustration is the fuse 
The flame is hate 
Tick tick tick 
Detonate 
She's the bomb 

Plastic models in plastic magazines 
Plastic kings and plastic queens 
All are seen on plastic TVs 
Prayed to by people on bended plastic knees 

What you think, well that's good too 
But not as much as what do you do 
This fuse burns slow 
Waiting to blow 
The world is a heavy load 
Watch it explode

Lawmakers with plastic policies 
Put plastic locks on their cities 
In hopes to keep them quiet 
Well go off 
Well blow up
