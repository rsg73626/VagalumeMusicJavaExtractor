LIVIN' LARGE

We're livin' large in our own little way
We're livin large and we don't get paid
We're livin' large in our own little way
Got some lemons, make some kickass lemonade
We're livin' large, and we got a lot
We're livin' large, a certain je ne sais quoi
We're livin' large and we got a lot
What they call a certain je ne sais quoi
We're livin' large
