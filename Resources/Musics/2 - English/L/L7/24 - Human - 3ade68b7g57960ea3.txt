HUMAN

We don't share the same rung with you
First glance, organic material not true
It appears to be human
But its not
Your shell's a canister with nothing inside
Third rate substance you cleverly disguise
It appears to be human
You're not worthy of gravity and space
Total destruction puts a smile on our face
