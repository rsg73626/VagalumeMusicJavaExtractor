BLOODSTAINS

They can make things worse for me
Sometimes Iâ€™d rather die
They can tell me lots of things
But I can't see eye to eye
Well, I know they know the way I think
I know they always will
But some day I'm gonna change my mind
Sometimes I'd rather kill

Bloodstains
Speed kills
Fast cars
Cheap thrills
Rich boys
Fine wine
I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind

Things seem so much different now
The scene has died away
I haven't got a steady job
And I've got no place to stay
Well, it's a futuristic modern world
But things aren't what they seem
Some day you'd better wake up
From this fucked up fantasy

Bloodstains
Speed kills
Fast cars
Cheap thrills
Rich boys
Fine wine
I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind
