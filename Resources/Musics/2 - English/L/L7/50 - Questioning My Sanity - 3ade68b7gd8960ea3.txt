QUESTIONING MY SANITY

I'm saving my piss in a jar 
This depression has gone too far 
I'm lying here in bed 
Am i alive or am i dead 

I'm questioning my sanity 

The paint chips are kicking in 
Desperation bubbles my skin 
There's stuff crawling on the floor 
Crackers with black books knocking at my door 

The TV's talking to me 
I'm questioning my sanity 

Everybody have a breakdown! 

I haven't changed my clothes in weeks 
I'm wallowing in my own stink 
My ass is sore from lying in bed 
Am i alive or am i dead?
