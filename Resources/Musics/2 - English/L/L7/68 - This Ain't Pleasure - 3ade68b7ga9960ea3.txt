THIS AIN'T PLEASURE

No raving beauty
She's got a good heart
He's got escaping
Down to an art 

This ain't pleasure
Don't ask why
This ain't pleasure
And monkeys can't fly 

She's an infection
A stain on his soul
He's her addiction
They're out of control 

This ain't pleasure
Don't ask why
This ain't pleasure
