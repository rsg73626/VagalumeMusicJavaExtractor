SHIRLEY

Welcome the first lady to try and qualify in an NHRA-dragster competition ~ Shirley Muldowney! 

Feels so real 
Crushing the steering wheel 
How many times 
Must we toe this line 
Halting me 
Is a fantasy 

Cha-cha! call her cha-cha! 
What's drag racing coming to? 

How many times must you be told 
There's nowhere that we don't go 

she's got good traction! 

I suggest you find a seat in the grandstands, Because you don't want to miss this!

She's just here wants 
What she wants to do 

I wonder if Shirley's got in her to hold that throttle down 

kills your joke 
as she's burning smoke 

Shirley Muldowney is pulling ahead... and she Takes the red light 

And you will find 
Crossing the finish line 

Shirley Muldowney has just set a new track record! 

Satisfaction! 

How much times must you be told 
There's nowhere that we don't go 

She's got good traction! 

What's a beautiful girl like you doing racing in a place like this? 

Winning. 


Winning. winning. winning. winning. 

The lady got through it 
Winning. 

What's drag racing coming to? 

There's nowhere that we don't go 

What's a beautiful girl like you doing racing in a place like this?

Winning. 

Winning. winning. winning. winning.
