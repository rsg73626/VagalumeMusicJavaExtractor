DISPATCH FROM MAR-A-LAGO

Hey, bro
Take this dispatch from mar-a-lago
I know
Got you a message from mar-a-lago

Storming the gates
Storming the gates
Storming the gates

In my room, flying the
Little blue birds going out of the phone
It's a fluke, we're not under attack
Apparently this universe is getting fat

Hey, bro
Take this dispatch from mar-a-lago
I know
Got you a message from mar-a-lago

Sos from the golden throne
Mogul's in deep shit, he's all alone
It's not good, a riot in fact
The whole friggin' country club is under attack

Hey, bro
It's getting real in mar-a-lago
I know
Storming the gates at mar-a-lago
Mar-a-lago
Storming the gates
Mar-a-lago
Storming the gates
Mar-a-lago
Storming the gates
Storming the gates at mar-a-lago

Mar-a-lago
Mar-a-lago
Mar-a-lago
Storming the gates at mar-a-lago
