JUST LIKE ME

Taime is a rock star
Just like me
Everyone loves him
Just like me
They all think he's punk
Just like me
Smack how he picks it up
So where's your dignity? 

faster, faster, faster....... 

Well axl is a love god
Just like me
The girls all love him
Just like me
But he's so messed up
Just like me
Doesn't want to give it up
So where's your dignity? 

Guns and, guns and, guns and
Guns and, guns and, guns and 

Well vixen are love gods
Just like me
Pretty pretty sex things
Just like me
Dressed up and to pay to play
I couldn't live that way
Hair spray and bustier
Can't fool me 

Vixen, vixen, vixen
Vixen, vixen, vixen 

Slash is a love god
I know it's hard to believe
Boys all dig him
But boys are easy to please
You've got the bimbos swinging
Like monkeys in the trees
You've got limos and money
