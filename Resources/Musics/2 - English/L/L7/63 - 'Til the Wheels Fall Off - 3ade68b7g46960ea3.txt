'TIL THE WHEELS FALL OFF

You and me 'till the wheels fall off 

You and me, we just fit
I'm addicted and i can't quit 

You and me 'till the wheels fall off 

You're enough to make me hot
What we got can't be bought 

You and me 'till the wheels fall off 

You and me, we just fit
I'm addicted and i can't quit 

You and me 'till the wheels fall off 

People say you're  a few quarts low
I don't care, let's go, go, go
