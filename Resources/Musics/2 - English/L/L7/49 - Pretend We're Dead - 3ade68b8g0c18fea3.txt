PRETEND WE'RE DEAD

What's up with what's going down 
In every city, in every town 
Cramping styles is the plan 
They've got in the palm of their big hands 

When we pretend that we're dead 
When we pretend that we're dead 
They can't hear a word we've said 
When we pretend that we're dead 

Turn the tables with our unity 
They're neither moral nor majority 
Wake up and smell the coffee 
Or just say no to individuality
