BITTER WINE

Iâ€™ll drink bitter wine
Iâ€™ll eat humble pie
Iâ€™ll do all this
For some peace
I'll do all this for peace of mind

Can we trust each other
I'm not your keeper
No farewell sister
Try to have savoir-faire
Pretend like I just don't care
You'll do all this just to get high
I'll do all this to just get by
