UNCLE BOB

Uncle Bob, you're a drunken slob
Daddy brought home a real winner
Yeah
Wake the guest, drink the tea
For his holiday dinner
Uncle Bob walked through the door
He was built
He was fucking ga-galore

The strength of his body was kind of a shock
The first time he put mike in a headlock
He crossed the line
Put his feet on the chair
How can we fine ?? aunt?

Uncle Bob, you're a drunken fucking slob
