MUST HAVE MORE

Her mouth is calling you
His hands are empty
My brain is drying out
It was so hungry

Must have more
Love for you

My eyes are cold and cracked
She cried a river
He pulls his hair right out
Tries to forgive her

Must have more
Love for you
Love for YOU...

Itâ€™s in the atmosphere
You cannot hide it
So many long sharp tongues
Keep us divided

Must have more
Love for you
Have more
Love for you
Must have more
Love for you
