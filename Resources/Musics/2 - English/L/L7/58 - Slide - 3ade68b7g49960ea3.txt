SLIDE

I put your stuff out on the porch - lettin' you slide
You pissed in your pants and put out the torch - lettin' you slide
You splattered the bathroom with your hair dye - lettin' you slide
I'm a kickin' you out and you know why

Yeah, i been letting you slide
You been along for the ride

You put your cane into my amp - lettin' you slide
When it comes to losers, you're the champ - lettin' you slide
From my garden I pull your weed - lettin' you slide
Your stupid ego i will not feed - no

Yeah, i been letting you slide
You been along for the ride
Yeah, i been letting you slide
You've been a thorn in my side

I put your stuff out on the porch - lettin' you slide
You pissed in your pants and you put out the torch - lettin' you slide
You splattered the bathroom with your hair dye - lettin' you slide
I'm a kickin' you out and you know why.. Boy

Yeah, i been letting you slide
You been along for the ride
Yeah, i been letting you slide
You've been a thorn in my side

Get on outta here boy
Took me three weeks to clean my bathroom
You know these amps don't grow on trees
