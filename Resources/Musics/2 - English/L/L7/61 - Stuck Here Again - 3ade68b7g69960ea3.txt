STUCK HERE AGAIN

I'm good at feeling bad 
I'm even better at feeling worse 
Some would say life is a charm 
I'm convinced it is a curse 

Yeah yeah i'm stuck here again 
I've learned to make 
Bad situations my friend 
It starts all over 
Just when it should end 
Yeah yeah i'm stuck here again 

Here comes that familiar pain again 
I'm low down, i'm feeling ill 
Yeah yeah i'm stuck here again 
Is there someone i could kill
