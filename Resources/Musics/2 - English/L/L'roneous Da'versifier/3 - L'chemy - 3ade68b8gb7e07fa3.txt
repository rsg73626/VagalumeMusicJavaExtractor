L'CHEMY

Class open your textbooks 
Hmm.. to the next school 

I put the formula in the bottle system registers volume 
But now all the mixes fixate and create the perfect limerick 
Mixed with bits of old shit 
Molded in Cold Crush increments rudiments recital 
Chronicle ignite on piles of paper 
Reaction rate escapes the scopes of isotopes called 
yes yes y'all so pipe you toke all dank smoke provokes 
the musical, whimsical, chemical, quantum lyrical 
stylist, compiling, reply to the stimuli 
Exemplified by the amplified phenomena 
Deep like operas, completing thoughts to the, finish in this 
I'm about to dent a sentence with the emphasis on sentiments 
Now as we enter this, Fifth phase of Hip-Hop 
Nowadays concave sights are prazed in amazing phrase 
A Purple Haze of latent pressure 
Methods blow, to a calculation formed a year ago 
Clear concise in theory enticing these 
Chemical compounds givin the raw sound to the beat 

Now class I pass the vapors, along with the syllabus 
And the context of my course next to the next is wordsound language 
Verbatim simulations crazy trace the field notions 
Concocting, elemental variums of dopeness 
Two portions of distortion, and a can of corned "real" 
with the universal science and, project appeal 
Where we'll stand starry-eyed, at applied analysis 
Case's b-boy inferences, substance infinite 
Imprint principles to postulate expression 
Krush Groove combustion, as testin the best in 
speak techniques, kinetic or organic 
For mix tape fanatics who be braggin that they have it 
over the average ass platinum savages, unravelling 
scientific notations obeying the fertile wind 
Bend, lung power for hours, avoiding perilous flights 
with earscopes and two mics, verbal showers over cowards 
through the force of thermodynamic anti-matter, OK 
It's granted to propensity of lyrical intensity 
multiplied by three point one four, or pi 
Cause it's diction of fragments in time 

Now class 
All further instructions will be given at the end of the recital 
Not to be misconstrued with anything else here 
we're teaching hip-hop 
Beats, lyrical stylings 
Love it, live it 
Hip-Hop, l'chemy
