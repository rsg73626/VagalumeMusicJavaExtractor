CASTAWAY THE STOWAWAYS

Hello out there! 
We're about ready to begin our program 

[L'Ron] 
Yeah.. 
This is dedicated to those who view hip hop as a voyage 
And on those voyagers we take you there 

* the DJ cuts Guru saying "In this business I witness trickiness" * 

First chapter a little wooden vessel set afloat 
with few passengers rhythms flatten the sail 
for a voyage where they wail thoughts yell thoughts 
Plotted over party grooves, but soon the party kinda grew 
And everybody kinda grew, when the money came through 
So now the wooden vessel's gotta go 
A yacht with outboard motor heave the hoe 
To the show man more cats flows enough to buy The Love Boat 
Luxury, but it puzzle me, how no one seemed to see 
the one's sneakin on -- the boat must be too big 
Fakes movin in to mix and mingle with the voyagers 
Ahoy it's land ho, the voyage comes to end 
But more sneakin in, so castaway the stowaways 
.
