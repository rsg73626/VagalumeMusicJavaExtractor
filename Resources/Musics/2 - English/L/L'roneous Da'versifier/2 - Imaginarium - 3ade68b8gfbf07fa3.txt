IMAGINARIUM

Thank you.. 

I'm travelling through lyrical parallels 
as my life spins like carousels 
Apparent hell's weren't apparent 
til I chilled and dwelled in myself 
And melded the surreal with what's real 
Then I slipped into a quarter where no mortal man should follow now 
in this mindstate I can't be touched cause I'm the master 
But I massed around the shadows of darkness, where these images is 
and voices, so many voices I feel trapped and had no choices 
Then like when lights go dim, the shadows started moving in 
like morphing darkness on the scene a dream from which I can't wake up 
So I shake up, the courage to speak, 
"Who are you show your face? My name's ???" 
I felt weak, no one here replied, but I felt breathing 
next to my shoulder, a panicked person once I felt it moving closer 
And posed to, ball up in my shit 
So I twist, turn and twist to get creating space 
As my heartrate race beyond this normal pace the place becomes uneasy 
and a voice breaks the silence, believe me 
"Those that creeped in darkness, were heartless" 
Time seemed to jerk 
Somethin hit me from the side and didn't, hurt 
but it spurked and sparked to kick some ass, a light showed 
My eyes glowed 
I saw a tattered broken man and clan of dirty dwellers 
lookin old and pale, even the dark ones hale, well 
the voice came nearer and the words sounded clearer 
like a mirror image of mine, if a voice can cast reflections 
Then I drowned myself in vibes, and tasted the inflection 

Kinda like a soul connection.. yeah.. 

Then; my conciousness condensed, to a sense of shiftlessness 
in the realm of which my wits pit anxiety 
with variety of loose emotions fighting me 
through heightened speeds of plethora 
Fallin deep into dementia, which sent a chill to my vertabrae 
Then a voice broke silence that I heard before 
Like a nightmare during insomnia 
Then a sihlouette cast over all of em 
and this image appeared in my retina, he spoke 
Said, "I'm Ali M'Dub, ruler of this place and caretaker 
Now this may stray way WAY beyond the confines of your mind so, 
listen Son, see.. 
we are the deepest reflections of your innerside 
You can't hide from us" 
Just then a voice shrieked in the, distance 
as I thought to myself this, must be nuts 
like Gulliver, talking bout Lilliput' 
Clear cut from the smut, of why's and what's 
Still drilled by the ills, stuck in this rut 
but the feelings formed deep inside my gut 
Then.. darkness pressed again 
Now I suspened in sensation 
My eyes traced that place in silence, pilin in information 
"You are ours and we are yours," he spoke 
My tribulations, formed a mental ass-whup 
Perhaps anything could've happened 
but that equation's unsolved 
Well all as it may be 
that voice decayed and frayed to a distant, memory see 
In our world of reality, we cling to dreams as a form of -- hope 
So this memoir of madness is actually.. the psychosis, of being dope 

Imaginarium 

See, in a nutshell it's not a wise tale 
but a tale of the wise
