AMNESIA

The morning call rings in my ears
The sun shines fervent through the blinds
The radio screams out a rhythm
I hold my head, I rub my eyes
Where did I go? What did I say? I can't remember it today

Oh, yeah

I tried some free association
To see what comes into my mind
Some images keep on recurring
A pretty girl bottles up wine

Oh, amnesia. Oh, amnesia

I feel my body start to tremble, ohh
I caught a chill that's down my spine
A lipstick message in a mirror, "I won't forget you. - Caroline. "
"Where did I go? What did I say? I can't remember it today
I tried to focus in a mirror
Saying something there

Amnesia, ohh (x4)

I think I'll take a cold shower
To see what comes into my mind
And afterwards things are much clearer
I won't forget you, Caroline
I won't forget you, Caroline. I couldn't forget you if I tried
I won't forget you, Caroline. I couldn't forget you if I tried
