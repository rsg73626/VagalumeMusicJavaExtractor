I TOLD YOU I'D WRITE YOU A SONG

When everything seems to slip through your fingers
remember
it's still beautiful somewhere
the sun has since been replaced by the shadow of your face
and a smile i haven't seen in days
when the world is crashing down
just find it in yourself to breathe
'its not over til its over' the wise man said to me
you know that i'd sing anything just to make you see

that the world isn't ending, every flower hasn't died
just know your story isnt over, all i ask of you is try
to believe that theres beauty out there somewhere
all you have to do is stare
into the setting sun
into the setting sun

when the jasmine skies reflect those diamond eyes
you shed a tear
i can see it shining from the steps on which i stand
lets both take honest guesses at where we think it lands
all i want to do is help you make things right
but just for tonight, find it in yourself to breathe
'its not over til its over' the wise man said to me
you know that i'd sing anything just to make you see
its just not over yet

the world isn't ending, every flower hasn't died
just know your story isnt over, all i ask of you is try
to believe that theres beauty out there somewhere
all you have to do is stare
into the setting sun
into the setting sun
its gonna rise someday
and someday you'll be there

its like the silence overwhelms
when the moments underrated
its like all the times you start to think
of all that time you wasted
its like the silence overwhelms
when this moments underrated
its like every time you tried to think
of everything you'd hated

wishing on that falling star
wondering just who you are
hoping, just hoping
it will all make perfect sense
will it all make perfect sense?

the sun is gonna rise someday
and someday, someday
someday you'll be there
you'll be there
forever
into the setting sun
