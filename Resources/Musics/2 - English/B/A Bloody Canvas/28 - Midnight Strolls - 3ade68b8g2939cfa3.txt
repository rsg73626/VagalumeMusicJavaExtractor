MIDNIGHT STROLLS

my pale skin constantly reflects into the sky
a subtle hint that the stars will fall tonight
the stars were never on our side
i take my midnight stroll coincedently
as the clock tolls twelve
twilight shadows beam onto my reflection
but to you I'm invisible
the mood of the moon is a sweet serene lullaby
an angels chorus
hold your breath while i take this devils kiss upon your neck
immortalize my dear, i wont say goodbye again
immortalize my love, i wont leave this way again
too many nights have been spent saturating
from just a goodbye kiss
at twilight we'll be together
i'll hold you forever
this romance slowly kills me when we arent together
oh, how she lusts for my lips
in the silence i strike
immortalize my dear, i wont say goodbye again
immortalize my love, i wont leave this way again
again i'll whisper
the stars were never on our side
but i'll hold you forever
