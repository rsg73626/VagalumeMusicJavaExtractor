SO FAR AWAY

I used to know you like the back of my hand
But that got lost while I was waving goodbye
It seems that we've lost so much
Eight years of my life lost like a single grain of sand
Swept up by the wind

The phone never rings
It’s just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound

Do you remember that starless night some September?
We sat out on my back porch with all our Pokemon cards
Back before we knew of life and the things that it could do
You told me then that we would always be best friends
We would always be best friends
We would always be

I have all these memories but I know they could mean something more to me
Than just a silent movie stuck on repeat
Where has all our time gone?
It seems like yesterday when we were living the jokes we would laugh at today
But we’re not laughing today
At least not together
I thought best friends meant forever
I thought best friends meant forever

The phone never rings
It’s just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound

Are you making a point to avoid everyone you left behind?

I used to think it was hard when you moved more than a street away
But now it’s harder today
Than it ever was before
You’re just a face in a photograph that hasn’t begun to fade
And I don’t think it ever will

Do you remember those summers we spent at the New Jersey shore?
When we were younger we used to jump through the waves
And make those jellyfish graves, the ‘gulls used to love that
When we started to notice the girls lying in their suits
We knew we had finally grown up
But so had they
So had they
Maybe we just grew up too fast

The phone never rings
It’s just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound

So, how do you like Minnesota?
If it’s too cold you can always come back home
But if Minneapolis is perfect then I’ll be happy for your life
I just have to ask

Are you making a point to avoid everyone you left behind?
Most importantly me…

The phone never rings
It’s just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound
