ASTRONOMY CAN BE FUN

Tonight, tonight I'll meet you
Underneath the stars...
I'll sing you something so beautiful
To spark the fireworks hidden behind your eyes
I'll sing you something short and sweet
To light the fire for your fuse
The sky will scream in reds and blues
I'll make tonight so beautiful
For its the night I'll say goodbye...
...isnt it pretty how the stars seem to streak together tonight...
..well i found a new start and it shines brighter than you, it lights my way through the dark, while i'm walking alone you'll be the only star in my sky with that look in your eyes, it will guide me home....
....and those nights in my arms prove that the first star you see may not be a star, you were never my star it seems....
i'll set my telescope to a peripheral view
so i can sit and wacth you and know you would shine so bright...
...well heres a new star and it could shine brighter than you, brighter than you...
...isnt it pretty how the stars seem to streak together at night?
