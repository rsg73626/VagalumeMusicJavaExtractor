YOUR MEDAL OF HONOR

You've stood strongly through the storms
Sleet and rain, a star was born
Now the days seem shorter
And you can barely catch your breath
It's such a painful moment for us all

Please hold on to something
I wont let you fade away
I know that hard times might be coming
But I wont let you fade away
Just hold on to something
Just take my hand
And say that you're invincible

Cuz in this life you've taught me
Things aren't what they seem
So when we get the bad news
I can always dream
That the time we spent had meaning
When it meant so

And I can't live without you
And I can't breathe without you
Please, dont leave me here
I'm begging
Time seems so distant now that
I'm lost in a memory of who you used to be

Cuz in this life you've taught me
Things aren't what they seem
So when we get the bad news
I can always dream
That the time we spent had meaning
When it meant so much to me

The nights are growing longer
When your time is growing shorter
And I can't breathe without you
I'm laying here when I should be there for you
And I cannot breathe without you
I cannot be without you

Please don't leave, leave me this way
When I can't breathe without you
Be without you.
