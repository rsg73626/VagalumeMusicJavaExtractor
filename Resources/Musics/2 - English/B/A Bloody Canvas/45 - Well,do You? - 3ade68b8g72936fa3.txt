WELL,DO YOU?

Do you, do you like walking down beaches
down the far reaches of dreams
where nothing is scripted, yet we live like a movie
it'll start with a close up and end with a soft kiss
your voice is so soothing, let it sing me to sleep

do you, do you like wrapping your arms around the waist of a lover
as you're walking through winter, does it make you feel safer
just to know that I'm there

do you, do you like hearing I love you
as it falls from my lips
my fingertips trace across your palm
as i stare into your eyes, with those stoic glances of mine
and i just know i've never felt so alive in all my life
this moments so perfect, its like i've fallen so deep

do you, do you like making those moments when we watch a movie
every scene is a sign, we make out through their meaning
i hope you know that i mean every word

do you, do you like long walks where we'll talk about nothing
but it will mean everything...

do you, do you like this song that i've written
yeah, i hope you that do
yeah, i know that you do.
