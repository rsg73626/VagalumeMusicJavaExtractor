YOUR NAME DOESN'T RHYME WITH ANYTHING

Dear girl I will not name, 
i hope you somehow feel the same as you did that
weekend past, sometimes life just moves so fast and
the things you love are gone, 
i'm not writing this song for any other reason than
the sudden change in seasons, 
i know i shouldnt even speak this but you're making
feel weak and oh so open, 
i don't mean to complicate things but i'm oh so bad at
keeping quiet, i'm not being romantic but my heart is
oh so frantic, clinging onto every smile and hanging
onto every word 

(just tell me what to do).
i still don't have a crush on you,
i still don't have a crush on you.
(tell me what to do).
