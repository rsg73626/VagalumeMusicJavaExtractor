WHEN ANGELS CARRY KNIVES THEY'LL CUT OFF THIER WINGS

the last time i checked i was clearly conciouss
but that condition has a way of changing
rearranging so severley
can you hear me?
well i cant hear myself between the
cluttered thoughts and broken things clogging
up my head
i'd be better off dead
so tell me for the last time, some things are better off left broken
the last time i checked i was thinking clearly
but i cant believe that when i nearly left everything behind
blinding truths and blinding lights have
left me at a loss of sight and a loss for words
so speak for me
explain the terrible truths of why this is the end
the colors had a way of blending into a mixed up, fucked up array of black and blues, just to match the color of my eyes....
...id be better off dead
so tell me for the last time
some things are better off left broken
...broken hearts and broken wings
are a few of the broken things that make me envy angels...
so tell me for the last time
i'd be better off dead and so would you...
