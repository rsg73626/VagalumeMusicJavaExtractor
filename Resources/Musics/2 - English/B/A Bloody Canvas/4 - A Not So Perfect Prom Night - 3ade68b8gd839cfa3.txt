A NOT SO PERFECT PROM NIGHT

Take the sunset and paint it with a darker shade of red 
Or maybe something elegant to match the color of your blouse
So douse yourself in cheap perfume 
And let's sit alone in your room with the lights turned down low

I know, I know,
Things aren't as perfect as they seem
What seems like artwork when it's over
Was just a drunken masterpiece

A desperate attempt at something beautiful,
Well I had this down to a science, baby
But I failed at chemistry so lie to me, lie to me
And tell me this was perfect

You can joke about it aferwards
The one night you spent without words
You can joke about it with your friends
About the boy who only had his heart to spend

Well I gave it to you for collaterall
But then you broke it on the wall
