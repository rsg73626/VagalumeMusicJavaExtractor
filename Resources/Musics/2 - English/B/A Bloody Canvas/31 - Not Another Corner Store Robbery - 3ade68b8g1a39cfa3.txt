NOT ANOTHER CORNER STORE ROBBERY

in the darkness i will watch you
breathing ever so softly, so unawhere
that i was ever there, you never noticed
the footsteps outside your bedroom window
i watched you lay your lips on, your fingertips on, what used to be mine, i'll hate you always...
...youve stolen what was never yours...
im sneaking through your bedroom window
i'll become a shadow, haunting every second of your perfect life, a silence screaming safety, dont worry i'll make you famous, i watched you lay your lips on, yoru fingertips on, what was never yours, i'll hate you always...
...you've stolen what was never yours...
with your eyes gouged out you'll never look at thisi the same, you said you wanted fame well here you go, what you always wanted, its beautiful, the way you are screaming just sets everything in place, i wont stop until yu return what you have stolen, no words, no hands, and you'll need those to hold him, with your eyes gouged out you'll never look at this the same, i'll make you suffer
....i watched you lay your lips on, your fingertips on, what was never yours...
