YOU'RE EVEN PRETTIER THAN AN AUTUMN NIGHT

its been a long day writing cheap words on cheap paper napkins, just to throw them away
the tension tied around my tongue keeps me takling, but like a noose wrapped around my neck it claims the air from my lungs, or maybe its just your stare, that aelsv me breathless, that leaves me speechless, begging for a way to tell you
Its been a long day writing your name on these pages, your name with this pen, but then i'll throw them away and you'll never know, and i'll never tell you, theres something about the air you breathe, it brings about the autumn leaves, chanigng color on the ground, i'll never make a sound while im begging to be found by a stranger, fallen from the tallest tree, changing color on the ground, i'll never make a sound while i'm begging to be found by you
you never even looked
well now i'll wait for the wind to blow me your way
i'll wait for you to walk by on your way back to me
its been a long day writing cheap words on cheap paper napkins, just to throw them away, biting my tongue while im biding my time, all along we'd walk the same thin line
i'd better not fuck this up, its been a long day...
