ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT

Somebody take a picture
I just want to stay this way forever
Live inside a picture frame and watch the world change around me
I want to stay innocent and free

That's my philosophy
The world doesn't work that way you would always say
It takes you by the wrist and throws you in the mix 
Of what you never wanted to be

I never wanted to be
So now, I'm begging for this photo to be taken
Begging to skip these choices that I'm making
Can't you just let me be
Can't you just let me breathe

But maybe this poetry can save me
This pen will be a dagger in the back of my captives
As I run far, further away from my future
And hopefully closer to you

Now as the reality begins to set it
The tears start to stream and as for my dreams
They mean nothing anymore
I am nothing anymore
Just another boy who should leave dreams for his sleep...
