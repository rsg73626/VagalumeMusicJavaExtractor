IT'S NOT A SIDE EFFECT BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE

Theres an aching in my chest from this brand new medicine
its left me tired and out of breath and now its hard to concentrate
but those are just the symptoms of affection
doctor diagnose me with something quick
my heart seems so heavy and i cant stop thinking of her
check my pulse, am i breathing?
check my lungs, maybe something is lodged in my throat
i cannot breathe
side effects of a new prescription may include loss of breath and loss of sleep but its worth it for you
i swear i wont get addicted, these pills just keep me in control
those are just the symptoms of attraction
side effects of a new prescription may include loss of sleep and a lack of focus
i cant seem to concentrate with you always on my mind, but trust me, i dont mind
check my pulse, am i breathing
or have you taken my breath away
diagnosis complete.
