HOW DO YOU SEE THE WIND?

is there some special way
in which the wind blows
or the crow flies
will we find our way back home?
following shadows of the trees
that we would grow underneath when we were young
swing set regrets and sunny afternoons
sunny afternoon

you asked me
"how do you see the wind?"
does it mark a place in time
when things were simpler
or is just a reason to repeat the seasons
since the wind it never really dies
i can see it now
its flowing like a dress through the leaves
blowing such a mess through the streets
it cant be autumn anymore

this is to a girl who somehow changed my world
and the way i look at life with open eyes
as the crow flies
we'll never find our way back home
lost inside a memory, this moment of perfection
when you and i used to watch the trees
swaying like a promise
in the wind

you asked me
"how do you see the wind?"
does it mark a place in time
when things were simpler
or is just a reason to repeat the seasons
since the wind it never really dies
i can see it now
its flowing like a dress through the leaves
blowing such a mess through the streets
it cant be autumn anymore

i think i'll just catch the wind
(Catch the wind)
i think i'll just catch the wind

you asked me
"how do you see the wind"
flowing like a dress through the leaves
blowing such a mess through the streets
it cant be autumn anymore
anymore
