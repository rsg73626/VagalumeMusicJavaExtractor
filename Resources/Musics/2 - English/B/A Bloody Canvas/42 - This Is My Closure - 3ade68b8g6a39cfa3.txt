THIS IS MY CLOSURE

holding my hands to my head at night
i'll wish upon fallen stars
just like we fell from eachother
i'll dream of perfection
but my gray skied past stains a
sky blue future of what could have been
should have been but never was
regrets line every page of this tattered book
this parchment stained with tears
unforgiving of the past
reflecting on my chosen path
realizing broken things aren't beautiful
but you, you were beautiful to me
do you remember when what we had was beautiful?
we were beautiful together...
...what have we got now?
no, nothing, maybe memories?
but thats all
all i will ever be now...
....just a memory
i'll wish upon fallen stars
just like we fell from eachother
i'll dream of perfection
but my gray skied past stains a
sky blue future of what could have been
should have been but never was
