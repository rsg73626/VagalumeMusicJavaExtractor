NOWHERE

I used to know you like the back of my hand
But that got lost while I was waving goodbye
It seems that we've lost so much
Eight years of my life lost like a single grain of sand
Swept up by the wind

The phone never rings
It's just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound

Do you remember that starless night some September?
We sat out on my back porch with all our Pokemon cards
Back before we learned of life and the things that it could do
On that night you told me how we'd always be best friends
Yeah, we'd always be best friends

I have all these memories but I know they could mean more to me
Than just a silent movie stuck on repeat
Where has all our time gone?
It seems like yesterday when we were living the jokes we can laugh at today
But I'm not laughing lately

The phone never rings
It's just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound

Can you recall all the summer nights we've spent underneath a setting sun?
The Jersey Shore will never look the same now that you're gone
When I'm alone it's your company that I'll miss the most
But now these nights on the boardwalk I can always search for your ghost
And pretend that you're here
And pretend that you're near
I wish you were here

I have all these memories but I know they could mean more to me
Than just a silent movie stuck on repeat
Where has all our time gone?
It seems like yesterday when we were living the jokes we can laugh at today
But I'm not laughing lately

The phone never rings
It's just silent and stings
Like salt in a metaphorical wound
