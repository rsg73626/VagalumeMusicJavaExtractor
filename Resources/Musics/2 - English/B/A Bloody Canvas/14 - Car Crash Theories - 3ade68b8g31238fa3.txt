CAR CRASH THEORIES

maybe if this car had crashed I wouldn't have to listen to all those pointless words from those loveless lips of yours
you said so much but i've never heard a word, other than goodbye, so goodbye, its better of this way
this sleepless vacation only proves some things aren't as beautiful as the crash
i'll finally see inside your chest as you bleed pure honesty, honestly darling
there's a bittersweet aura in the air and its not the smoke from the engine as we die out miles away from home, we're not lost
only hopeless, this car crash is the only real thing i've felt for the past week
my voice is weak and i can't see you anymore, the glass is fogging up, there must be someone out there who can save me, pull me out by my hair
I don't care if it hurts, i dont want to die here by your side, its as good as dying alone
