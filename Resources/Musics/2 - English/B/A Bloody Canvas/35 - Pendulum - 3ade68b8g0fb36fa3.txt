PENDULUM

The pendulum swings in slow symphony with my heart or your moods,
no matter how far we seem to drift we'll always come back to the center and i'll always come back to your arms. 
Let's put tonight behind us, at least until it happens again and we do the same thing. 
This pendulum sways through those sweaty summer days when we aren't allowed inside but we go in anways,
just to stay cool.
Just to stay cool. 
It seems as though we drag along with the motions of a pendulum,back and forth,back and forth and back to the center. Back to your arms. 
Back to how things should be. 
Back to the way a pendulum should swing,swaying ever so carefully towards the edge but always coming back.
