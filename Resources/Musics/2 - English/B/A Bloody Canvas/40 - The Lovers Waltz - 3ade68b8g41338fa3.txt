THE LOVERS WALTZ

will a raven dance tonight
on the grave of this horrible sight
it used to be a holy ground
not even mice would make a sound
(but that was before)
so long ago, i could never remember
i still taste that december
but it only tastes like failure
but thats only if you're asking her,
if you would have asked me
then maybe, maybe you would see
a different side to the story

there were fields
so pure and true
(but that was before they came in contact with you)
the rivers flowed gold, with shores of silver
i could swim there everyday
(but that was before you scared the sky away)
i remember perfection, but our stories the same
the sun was still shining before the lovers came

so now im stuck in this hellish nightmare
where the dead walk, the people stare
its a graveyard, its a graveyard
it isn't hard to see
the place this this could be
but its too far gone, so far gone
i told you a story of a life that i knew
back before i knew of you
and the horrors you would bring

there were fields
so pure and true
(but that was before they came in contact with you)
the rivers flowed gold, with shores of silver
i could swim there everyday
(but that was before you scared the sky away)
i remember perfection, but our stories the same
the sun was still shining before the lovers came

the rivers flow with blood, the shorelines made of mud
trees blacker than the ash of your eyes
burnt alive by the weight of your lies
how could you do this to me?
how could you do this to me?
the sun is fading quick, the haze can make me sick
nothing is alive, in this wasteland
i should have never took your hand
how could you do this to me?
how could you do this to me?
i trusted you not to break my heart
