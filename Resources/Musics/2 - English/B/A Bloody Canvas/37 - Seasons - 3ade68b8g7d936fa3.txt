SEASONS

The sky sets a lighter shade of white this winter, promising a snow that never did fall,
one we never really saw at all, the air slips into a tired winter chill that wouldve seeped through our bones if we had been alone, but we weren't walking alone,no
the cold air forces me to hold my breath but 
I wouldn't be breathing anyways, so afraid to breathe,
so afraid to speak, there's an aching in my legs,
i feel them going weak, but it's not the cold or frozen skies, it's just that burning in your eyes, that keeps me warm.
I can feel my hands growing numb, but not before I've found someone who can melt the snow from winters past,
the words i spoke i spoke them fast,for fear that winter wouldn't last, but I swear there'll be snow on the ground, and sands on distant shores, and when the weather seems right, i'll hold my hand in yours....
