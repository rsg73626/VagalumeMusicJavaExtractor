SHIT POPPER

[TM = Tanisha Michelle, L = Lyndah]

[Intro:]
[Woman]
Yo Lyndah, I hear you're trying to talk to my man
What the fuck you looking at him for?
Man, you better stay out of his face
[L]
Bitch!
You getting up in my face
I'm a put you in your fucking place

[Chorus:]
[L & TM]
Yo bitch, you better shut up
Before you get fucked up
You fighting her, you fighting all of us
You better chill, before you get bum rushed

[Verse 1:]
[L]
I'm a tell you once, and you best understand
No, I don't want your dumb ass man
Stepping to me with that bullshit
Bitch, you know you get your ass whipped
Me, and that motherfucker?
Ho, that nigga sucker
Get the fuck out my face, stay out my path
Or my footprint'll be a fucking autograph
In your ass, stupid bitch
Popping that dumb shit
You crazy as shit
I'll stomp a mudhole in you, bitch
She dumb as hell
Bitch gonna make me go to jail
But I don't give a fuck
[L & TM]
'Cause we got the bail

[TM (Over Chorus)]
Yo bitch, get out her motherfucking face!
Who do you think you talking to like that?
You don't be going off on my homegirl like that
I'll break your motherfucking ears right quick in this motherfucker
Get off her face!
Go do the dishes
You gonna do what?
You gonna do, make my motherfucking day, bitch!
Make it!
Bitch, I'll hit you with... [fades]

[Verse 2:]
[L]
Shit Popper, Do Hopper
Big Doctor, motherfucker chopper
One big bidet up in the house
Others just say she's just a bitch with mouth
She got a problem, thinking highly scented
Hey yo bitch, go on and talk that shit
[TM]
I'm the Shit Popper, the ho from Brooklyn
Niggaz on my shit, yo bitch, stop looking
But I don't give a fuck about what they say
'Cause a bitch like me, I got to get paid
See, I'm the type of bitch that dates the dope dealers
Set the suckers up with the damn card feelers
Always got to be posting bail
'Cause the niggaz I hang with live in jail
For taking out punk motherfuckers like you
Since you're out to get robbed, that's how I do
'Cause I'm a bitch, I don't like suckers
[L & TM]
Why
[TM]
I like hard motherfuckers
The niggaz that push the dope
[L & TM]
Why
[TM]
They buy my fat gold rope
Brothers that take a life or two or three
They'll take yours if you fuck with me
As you can see, I don't take no shit
I'm the type of bitch that you don't want to fuck with
Bitches who think you got class
Ain't none of y'all shit, so you can kiss my ass
All my man did for some goddam dough
Ready to fuck with some coke or some blow
Acting like you sophisticated and shit
You ain't nothing but a high price crack bitch
Broke motherfuckers, this one's for you
[Men]
Fuck y'all bitches
[L & TM]
Yo, fuck y'all too
[TM]
Bum motherfuckers ain't got no money
Don't you want pussy, do I look like a dummy?
If I let a nigga like you get laid
Huh, I got to get paid
Lyndah, since you're the head bitch
Why don't you grab the mic and finish this shit
[L]
Hold up, hold up, wait a minute
Wasn't that the same motherfucker whipping your ass last week
And now you want to step in my face?
You fucking fool!
It's time for that bitch to get schooled

[Verse 3:]
Well I'm Lyndah and I'm a teach you
How to deal with a woman beater
'Cause you and your man disagree
It don't give him no authority
To be beating, kicking, hitting on you
Bitch, I'm a tell you what the fuck to do
Wait, 'till he go to sleep
Into the bedroom, you must creep
[gunshots]
Three to the head
Leave the motherfucker there laying for dead
Punk motherfucker, he ain't got no heart
If he did, he wouldn't hit ya, ho, from the start
So ladies, if you're sick of getting hit
Repeat after me
[L & TM]
Fuck that shit!
[L]
Call the police, what the fuck for?
Sick of seeing two dicks at my door
They take the motherfucker for a walk around the block
You think that'll make the ass whooping stop?
No, you must ask yourself
If you can't, then pay someone else
To break a few of his goddam bones
That'll make the motherfucker leave you alone
'Cause I'm Lyndah and I'm a teach you
That's what you do with a woman beater
