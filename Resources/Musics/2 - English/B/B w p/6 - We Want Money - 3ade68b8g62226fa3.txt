[Verse 2: L]
Today, you're a nice brother in a Jeep
You don't get paid from the street
Apart from a brother who stand correct
Man, I don't give a fuck, just cash your paycheck
Now, you say I'm missing
True love, hugging and kissing
Like Tyson and Givens, that's the condition
Fuck that to the wall, that's how I'm living

Yeah, we got some boyfriends
Yeah, we go† two kids
Yeah, we want your money
Fuck you think this is?

Marry you, don't make me laugh
Don't you know all I want is cash?
