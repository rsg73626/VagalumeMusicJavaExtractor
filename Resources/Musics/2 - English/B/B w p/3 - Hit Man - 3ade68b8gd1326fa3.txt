HIT MAN

[HM = Hit Man, L = Lyndah, BF = Boyfriend]

[L]
Easily I approached
Found the Hit Man, gave him the dope
My man fucked around behind my back
This ho ain't going for that
Misses says I should chill
I said, fuck that shit, It's time to get ill
Fooled around on me twice
Now the motherfucker gotta pay with his life
He ain't nothing but a goddam ho
I asked him if he fucked around, he said no
Found out that he lied
Now it's time for the nigga to die
[HM]
What you got, what you need, yeah, what you want done?
Want me to kill him, or terrorize him for fun?
[L]
Shoot the motherfucker right between his legs
Turn him around, give him two to the head
[gunshots]
[BF]
Yo B, how could you do this?
[L]
This bitch here, ruthless
[gunshots]
Now, I got the dope, and the dough
So what's it going to be like, yes or no?
[HM]
Alright, baby doll, now here's the plan
How I'm gonna take out the brother man
I'll take him for a ride to cop in the park
Towards the back, where it's nice and dark
It'll be clean, no evidence to find
And when I finish, ha ha ha, I'll cold ditch the nine
You know what I'm saying?
[L]
Serious biz, this ain't no joke
So I followed behind to see how it'd go
[gunshots]
[BF]
[groans]
[L]
He lay there crying
A look in his eyes, yeah, he knew he was dying
He begged, bad, he would put up a fight
But I had strict orders: take his life
'Cause I'm the type of bitch that don't give a fuck
[BF]
[caughs]
[L]
Nigga, you don't press your luck
Nigga got to learn you can't have it all
Fuck me, you wanna take a fall
I hate it when a man cheat around on his woman
Bitch spread her leg, and he's all up in 'em
A relationship, I gave it all I had
But he always found ways to make me sad
You know what they say, "no pain, no gain"
Shit, that's for a dumb ass dame
Me, myself, and I do fine
I manipulate motherfucker's minds
And my man's life just came to an end
He got taken out by his best friend
End of story
[BF]
I need an ambulance
[L]
He ain't dead yet?
[BF]
I need an ambulance
[L]
Finish that motherfucker
[BF]
Baby?
[caughs]
[gunshots]
[long silence]
[L]
Thanks, but I don't need witnesses
[HM]
What the fuck you doing?
You doublecrossing bitch!
[gunshots]
[L]
Now I got the dope, and the dough
Two dead motherfuckers, now it's time to roll
