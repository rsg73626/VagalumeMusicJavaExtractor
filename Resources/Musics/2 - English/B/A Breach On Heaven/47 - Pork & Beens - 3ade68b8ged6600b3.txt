PORK & BEENS

Let me have this cutest thing
I ever did see in my life.
Everybody looks for something new,
Like the rosy-cheek debutante
Who falls in love with every billboard guy,
Funny hairdo and a lazy bedroom-eye,
Blue like any ocean,
Who am I to say it ain't devotion.
Fantasize the smell of bodylotion.
Who could ever stand in your shoes.
Let me have this cutest thing
I ever did see in my life.
Everybody looks for something new,
Like the pony-tailed waitress
Who says she really isn't what she seems.
She will telll you in between the prk and beans
That nothing's gonna change her.
Life, it seems ain't nothing but a stranger.
Laugh it off, just remember
Who could ever stand in your shoe.
