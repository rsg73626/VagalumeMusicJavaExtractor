AUF WIEDERSEHEN

So it's auf wiedersehen,
I guess I'll see you around.
If I stay I know I'd only bring you down.
There'll be other times,
There'll be other days.
Mortify the flesh untill we find a way.
If I could tell you now,
I won't know where to start,
Tearing down the walls untill they fall apart
At your first goodbye,
Write a whiter lie,
Frozen like a cold stare in a feeble heart.
But it's so much more
When you spell it out.
Now, this is why we got a load of doubts.
It's obvious now, we're not allowed
To play a twosome.
Read it as a signal, now
That we feel the same.
So, it's auf wiedersehen.
There'll be other times,
There'll be other days.
Let's mortify the flesh untill we find a way.
'Cause it's so much more
When you spell it out.
Now, this is why we got a load of doubts.
It's obvious now, we're not allowed
To play a twosome.
Read it as a signal, now
That we feel the same.
So it's auf wiedersehen,
I guess I'll see you 'round.
