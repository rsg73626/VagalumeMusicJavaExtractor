ENTIRE RACES

When the man inside the moon
Decides to change his smile
And the autumn coloured leaves
Don't seem to be worth while.
When everything seems strange
And nothing feels the same.
I'm embarrassed by the dreams
That I once held for true.
When it seems like everyone of them
Was misconstrued.
Now everyone's asleep,
Who should I belief.
Should this be real, the way I feel.
Was there something wrong with me.
Is there something wrong with me.
Let them all doubt, you've been right before.
When I'm sick of all the soaker
Friends I knew before.
And then finally everyone of them
Walked out the door.
Now everyone's asleep,
Who should I believe.
Entire races, have been squireling their feelings away.
I watch their faces and the traces of toiling thru yesterdays.
Sugarspine, blow my mind,
Make me watch and waste my time.
Common horde, common sore,
Watching life jump out the door.
