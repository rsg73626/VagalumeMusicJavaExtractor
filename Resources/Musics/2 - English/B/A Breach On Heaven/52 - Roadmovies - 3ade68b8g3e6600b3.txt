ROADMOVIES

I'm inside this movie and I'm some sort of actress.
They've got the proper location, but I'm wearing the wrong dress.
They got so many actions, but they can't find the film crew
And I guess I might as well be in the nude,
'Cause there's no one here to tell me what to do.
Down at the station they have started the New Age,
I had a full invitation, but I flunked at the last stage.
There were too many questions and no one to talk to
And I guess that's what they call "in solitude",
When there's no one here to tell the answers to.
This is your solid tear.
This is your landing gear.
This is you.
On and on
We're heading down the road of self-reliance.
I once knew this lady, she was full of frustrations,
She's a suntanned example of a worn-out caucasian,
She said, " Don't take the offer, 'cause you don't really need to ",
And I guess that's why she hates her solitude,
'Cause she never had a heart to listen to.
Bouncers in rehab, saying they'll get you
'Cause they know you're not leaving until someone connects you
To the proper authorities, who have somehow forgotten
How to make a civil person out of you.
Now there's no one here to tell the answers to.
This is your solid tear.
This is your landing gear.
This is you.
On and on
We're heading down the road of self-reliance.
