A BREACH ON HEAVEN TWENTY-THREE PT.1

Twilight, my room
waiting for a sign
searching for a goal
23 years are gone

The only thing that we should know is
that we shouldn´t know
The answer slowly fades away
(We want to know, we want to know)

Bad lies we've told
Good times we have lost

The past carved on my mind
surfaces among my shifty thoughts
A wing-stroke
Nothing is more as we had left it years ago

A snow flake hits my grimmy window
Another summer is over
I'll miss the way we used to love
an I just really want to know

The only thing that we should know is
that we shouldn´t know
The answer slowly fades away
(We want to know, we want to know)

Bad lies we've told
Good times we have lost

You got to spell out these words
Stop talking shit to us
We gave all the best but
it wasn't enough
