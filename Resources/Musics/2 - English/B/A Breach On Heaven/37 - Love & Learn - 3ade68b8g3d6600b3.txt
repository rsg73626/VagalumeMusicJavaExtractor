LOVE & LEARN

Bury me with my autograph
And my pictures and letters from you.
God only knows where I want to be
And he knows what these memories can do.
Synthesize, analyze,
Loving and learning from you.
Burning softly and so intense,
Something is dying in you.
Find me inside a melody
Or a poem that hasn't been used.
No one's here for eternity
And who knows what the future will do.
Synthesize, analyze,
Loving and learning from you.
Burning softly and so intense,
Something is dying in you.
I talked to the forests,
I talked to the fields,
I talked 'til my face had turned blue.
I turned to the heart and the matter of things,
But still, I can't talk to you.
So bury me with my autograph
And my pictures and letters from you.
'Cause God only knows where I want to be
And he knows that it isn't with you.
Synthesize, analyze,
Loving and learning from you.
Burning softly and so intense,
Somehow, I've turned into you
