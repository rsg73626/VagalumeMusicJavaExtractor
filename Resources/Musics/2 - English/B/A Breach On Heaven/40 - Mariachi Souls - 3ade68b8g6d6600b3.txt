MARIACHI SOULS

Steel, what else can I feel,
When nothing else seems real.
Bittersweet surprise,
I've seen it in my eyes.
Give him one last call,
Then explain it all.
I know just what he'll say,
You're better off this way.
At least I still got one thing
And I've got it in my hands.
Let me tell you one thing,
You gotta have a plan.
Don't think that this is going to blow my mind.
Bleed, call it my last deed,
A payment for his greed.
Mariachi souls,
More lethal than you know.
Give him one last call,
Then explain it all.
I know just what to say,
You gotta make him pay
At least I still got one thing
And I've got it in my hands.
Let me tell you one thing,
You gotta have a plan.
Don't think that this is going to blow my mind,
No not this time
