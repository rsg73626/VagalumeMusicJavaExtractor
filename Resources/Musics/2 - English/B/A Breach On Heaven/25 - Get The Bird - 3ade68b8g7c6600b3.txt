GET THE BIRD

Get the bird
And leave it alone
It always finds
It's own way home
Don't think it's lame to let it slide
Just let it slip outside
Tha'tll be allright
Listening to the sea
Flowing in and out of me
Head swirling round, towards the tide
It feels so senseless now to fight
I'm in no hurry to get somewhere
I'll just try to hang in there
This might be right
Just don't go looking for no clue
I just do the things I do
If that's allright with you
Get the bird
Just let it hurt
Won't look too good
Well, who said it should
