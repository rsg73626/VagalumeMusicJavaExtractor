ALL THE OTHER FISH

You smile so sweetly when you dream
And I wonder what that expression really means.
Could it be that you're trying to
Turn the key when I don't want you to.
And I think that you already know.
Ain't it funny how the streets seem so grey?
When even the brightest colors seemed much brighter yesterday
And all you can think of is how to get away.

You say you don't want to tie me down
And you point out all the other fish around.
But maybe it's just the opposite
And I don't want to go through with it
'Cause I think that you already know.
Ain't it funny how the streets seem so grey?
When even the ones you love seem to turn their heads away
And all you can think of is how to get away.
