HAVE A HEART

A pointless state of mind,
You said so yourself.
Now here's your distraction,
Coming through the sidedoor:
Can we synchronize our souls?
I know you will be fine,
It's just a matter of opinion.
But plead no disaster,
Life can be so easy,
Like tonguing candy out your molars
From your snicker-bar lunch.
There's a start, there's a start.
Have a heart.
I need to see your laughter.
I need to hear your laughter.
And in between the sea of sounds,
You gotta make it happen, now.
It's only just begun, dabbling in the sun.
Have a heart.
I need to hear your laughter.
And pretty soon, you'll realize
The beauty of the simple life
And your signs are the stars.
Have a heart.
I need to hear your laughter.
