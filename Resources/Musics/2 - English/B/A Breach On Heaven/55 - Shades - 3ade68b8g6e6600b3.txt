SHADES

Come closer, come closer,
Look into these sable blues.
Light clover, light clover,
Turn the leaves, it's only me.
Uncanny, uncanny,
Push the blade into the shades.
Unmoving, unmoving,
Bare to see, it's only me.
And with open eyes,
Hear the greenhorn cry.
You're killing me.
You're killing me, slowly,
Shoving me with words.
Put the finger where it hurts,
You're killing me.
