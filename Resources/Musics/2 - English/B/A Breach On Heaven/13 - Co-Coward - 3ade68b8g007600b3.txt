CO-COWARD

Tell me 'bout your youth,
Ah, just tell the truth.
Was it nice and smooth
Or was it a lie.
And when you were a child,
Were you young and wild
Or just undefiled,
Ready to cry.
It should have been me,
You should've believed in me
It's all in the way, you say,
This doesn't happen every day.
It doesn't happen every day.
Living in denial,
Have you lost your smile?
Well, it takes a while
Before you'll forgive.
And what's that on your sleeve,
Won't you tell me, please.
We can makebelieve,
Just for a while.
Cow-ow-cowcoward incurable.
