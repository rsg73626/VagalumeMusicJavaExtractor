HANDS OFF

This is just a ghost town, posing as a city
It's like a dead-end street, we've gotta move right now
Then you come running in, looking so pretty
I'm so glad you made it, can we leave right now?
We want a world in a mobile home
Stay connected by a cellular phone
So many out there, living a lie
If death is a toll, we'll just tamper with life
At least that's what you wanted
At least that's what you said you had to have right now
And now that we are on it, can we seize the moment?
Don't let me down
It's kinda rough, but it's enough
People always kill the things they love
Let's make a sign that says ÒHands Off!Ó
This is just a ghost town, posing as a city
Hotdogs & soda's & we're on our way
The music's blaring out now, could you please just turn it down now
I could sleep all day
Yes, I had a drink last night
I haven't slept a wink last night
I don't regret a thing, that's right
This is intense, lower your fences
Just let it ride, taillights that fade in the night
You'll be fine, just watch that sign
Bear to the right, flashing blue neon light
Hands off.
