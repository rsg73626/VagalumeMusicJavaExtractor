LOVER I DON'T HAVE TO LOVE

I picked you out of a crowd and talked to you.
I said, "I like your shoes."
You said, "thanks can I follow you?"

So it's up the stairs and out of view-
No prying eyes
I poured some wine
I asked your name, you asked the time...

Now it's two o'clock-
The club is closed and we're up the block
Your hands on me; pressing hard against your jeans

Your tongue in my mouth, trying to keep the words from coming out
You didn't care to know who else may have been you before

I want a lover I don't have to love.
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck.
Where is the kid with the chemicals?
I thought he said to meet him here, but I'm not sure
I got the money if you've got the time
You said, "it feels good."
I said, "I'll give it a try."

Then my mind went dark
We both forgot where your car was parked
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning

Bad actors with bad habits
Some sad singers they just play tragic
And the phone's ringing and the van's leaving
Let's just keep touching; let's just keep, keep singing...

I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where is the kid with the chemicals
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seem to slip my mind

But you..
But you...
You write such pretty words
But life's no storybook
Love's an excuse to get hurt
And to hurt

Do you like to hurt?
I do, I do
Then hurt me..
Then hurt me...
Then hurt me...
