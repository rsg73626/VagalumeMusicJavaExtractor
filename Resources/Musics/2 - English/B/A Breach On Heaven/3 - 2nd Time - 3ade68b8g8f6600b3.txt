2ND TIME

It started to fade
Innocent but odd enough anyway
And caused instant down
Then you shed me some tears
And glued them all around

The part that interferes: singing
You couldn't tell me all those years
You got the some heartache
Now you've got it right

There's always a second time
Always a second time
Always a second time in your mind

Oh my God, they say 'deeply in love'
Even though this ain't real
Pretty soon you'll find out
You had to turn to see me
Every now and then
Don't you need that?
Probably so
The truth was in the other eye, and honest to God
You had me near you all the time
And then you say, oh but
Never mind

There's always a second time
Always a second time
Always a second time in your mind
