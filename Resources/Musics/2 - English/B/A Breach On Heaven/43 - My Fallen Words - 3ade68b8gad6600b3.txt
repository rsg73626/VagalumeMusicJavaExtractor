MY FALLEN WORDS

My fallen words are like pennies from heaven,
Like a message of love,
Sent from above and anything could happen to me.
Yes, anything could happen to me.

My fallen words don't remember the hurt,
They remember the meaning,
As they drip off the ceiling and anything could happen to me.
Anything could happen to me.

I can leave my feelings anywhere I damn well please
And take my words and leave the meaning somewhere underneath.
Oh yes, and anything could happen to me,
Oh, anything could happen to me.

My fallen words don't remember the hurt,
They remember the meaning,
As they drip off the ceiling and anything could happen to me.
Oh, yes, anything could happen to me.

And take the words and leave the meaning somewhere underneath.
Oh, yes, and anything could happen to me.
Oh, anything could happen to me.
