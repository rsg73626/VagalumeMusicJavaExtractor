1 OFF DEAL

People on sidewalks, engaging in small talk and
All I can think off : "Mustard on your chin"
And I can see that you're hiding your serious side and I don't mean to pry
But I know the state you're in
This ain't no one off deal for me
I know exactly what you need
But people on sidewalks, they don't know what they talk about
And I think it's a write off, pretending they're a scene
And it's the odious seasons and all of the reasons
You get down to see them, see them on your knees
This ain't no one off deal for me
I know exactly how you're feeling
I'm pleasing you
I'm pleasing me
But don't think I don't know what I'm doing
I see in me what I see in you
And every other fool
I'll leave it entirely up to you.
