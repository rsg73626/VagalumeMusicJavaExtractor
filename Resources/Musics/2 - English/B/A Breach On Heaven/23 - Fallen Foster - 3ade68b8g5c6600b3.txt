FALLEN FOSTER

Throw it on the floor.
Never mind the mess,
Cause I've been down before
And it doesn't hurt.
Play your saddest songs.
Play them all night long
Cause I've been sad before
And it doesn't hurt no more.
Yeah, it doesn't hurt.
Feeling like a fallen foster child,
Gracefully neglected,
But always with a smile
That was nothing at all.
Raised upon a bench of second-best,
Always quite aware you're not like all the rest
That was nothing at all.
Throw it on the floor.
Nevermind, the ma did that,
Been down before.
Yes I've been down before
And it doesn't hurt no more.
Now it doesn't hurt.
