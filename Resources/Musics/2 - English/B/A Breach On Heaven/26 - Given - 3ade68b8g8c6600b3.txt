GIVEN

Isn't this simple?
Everything's floating.
Leave all the answers on the border line.
Over the ceiling,
Over the ocean,
Leave all the answers on the border line.
Please don't tell the land lord,
But I really had to leave.
Heaven is a place
Where I'll be rolling down my sleeves.
But what is she thinking?
Is it a landslide?
Leave all the answers on the border line.
Ah, reaping of my soul.
