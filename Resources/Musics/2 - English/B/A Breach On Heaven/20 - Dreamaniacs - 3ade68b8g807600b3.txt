DREAMANIACS

Don't give up on me
Dreamaniacs don't aim to please, yeah,
They walk differently
In-between realities
Though my feet are on the ground, my head is on a cloud
Just enough to save my soul
I tell myself I'll take control
It's just one less dumb mistake I'll make
One less stupid step I'll take
One last time I'll take a break
Life is just a piece of cake
Don't give up on me
I know you seem to think I'm lazy, yeah,
But I'll get up, you'll see
Just in time to find my way
I get so angry everytime you try to push me into
Some sort of direction
Like I need some new direction
I don't need your dumb directions, thank you, please
Dreamaniacs don't aim to please
It's just one less dumb mistake I'll make
One less stupid step I'll take
One last time I'll take a break
Life is just a piece of cake
That's all
