CERTAINLIE

How many times can you tell a lie
Before it has been certified?
Can I say the same of you?
Just when you told me that you didn't like
The way I held myself tonight,
Were you stabbing at the truth?
How does it feel, when you feel like you feel?
'cause you're pushing everyone, distant like the sun.
And how come you feel like you feel when you feel?
Is it just your need to run?
Ah, you like the fight, stabbin' at my silhouette,
Try to talk me into bed, what's the deal.
And I, I'm riding on an easy moon.
Ah, you fell in love too soon, head over heels.
You can't take away the scar
Or turn me into what you are.
'you stay to play, or leave', you say.
It never mattered anyway at all.
How does it feel, when you feel like you feel?
'cause you're pushing everyone, distant like the sun.
And how come you feel like you feel when you feel?
Is it just your need to run, distant like the sun?
Now how can you feel, what you feel, when you feel?
And I fear, I'm riding on an easy moon.
Ah, you fell in love too soon, head over heels.
If I am staring at your silhouette,
Never climbing into bed.
Don't be sad.
