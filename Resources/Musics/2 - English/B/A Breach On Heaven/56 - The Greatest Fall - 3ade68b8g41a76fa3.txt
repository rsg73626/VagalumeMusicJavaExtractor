THE GREATEST FALL

Get On!

Was this the love we've longed for eachother? (Freefall, involved)
We're butterflies swirling in the void! (Freefall, involved)

Clear off your thoughts your turned my flank before
Bad times had dissolved our strange story
I switched that voice off so troubles are past and gone
I'm gonna solve my certain doubts

Why don't you believe in tomorrow?
You make me think that I'm dumb
I'm singing out your sorrow
There's nothing left to complain, a false note
You fade away

Who's more willing to give than to receive? (Freefall, involved)
We can agree in neither case (Freefall, involved)

Don't grieve for how you jerked me over babe
When you refused to accept my honest help
So far so good but remember that we used
To kiss over flood and field

Why don't you believe in tomorrow?
You make me think that I'm dumb
I'm singing out your sorrow
There's nothing left to complain, a false note
You fade away

You walked straight out of my life in those sad winter days
Everything it's more glowing to me now
I hate 50's movies!

You don't believe in what you say! Freefall! Involved!

Why don't you believe in tomorrow?
You make me think that I'm dumb
I'm singing out your sorrow
No leg pulls!It's the same shit
I'll take it to the limit
