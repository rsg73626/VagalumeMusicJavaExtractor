RUDDER

Bow down for the band on the cover,
They seem to make it all across the usa.
Bow down, the band's been discovered,
They even made it on the r.s-tones these days.
What a beautiful noise.
What an obvious choice.
But the records seems to do so well
And everybody loves a band that sells.
So why should it happen for me
If it could happen for you?
It's not like a major catastrophe,
It's something you choose.
So many people believe
That they could achieve anything
Worth their while,
Anything worth a smile.
Lying flat on the floor,
Get the lock off your door.
You want something to do,
Make a record or two.
Bow down for the band on the cover,
They seem to make it all across the usa.
Bow down, the band's found a rudder,
And now they finally hit the charts,
They're on their way.
What a beautiful noise.
What an obvious choice.
Now the record seems to do so well
And everybody loves a band that sells.
