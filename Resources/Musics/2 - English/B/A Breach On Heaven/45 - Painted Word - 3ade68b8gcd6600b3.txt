PAINTED WORD

Your name is like a song I sing so sweetly
And though it may be wrong, I felt so deeply
All doubts are set aside, we found our turf
When you gave your word,
The painted word

Woke you up, 4 am
Said I wanted more, here we go again
Reminiscing every day
How do I always seem to get my way
Lock me out, pull me in
We're not gonna stop until we both give in
Reminiscing every day
How do I always seem to get my way

You better tell me
You better tell me now
Reminiscing every day
No one's gonna leave until I get my way

This only happens once in a life time
And when it happens, always the right time
Your voice is soothing, down all the way
Like a hummingbird
Your painted word
