DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL

Here me now, don't just stand there
I can see your doubts
We're playing "Operation Tease" and, no, you can't change the rules
There's a penalty for every pass you make at me
Just wait and see
Guilty as sin
Up to my chin
I got arrested on a whim: Don't Touch That Dial!
Our worlds collide, but they don't change
They kind of slip 'n slide
Until we're close enough to see that, no, you can't change my world
There's a penalty for every claim you make on me
Just wait and see
Guilty as sin
Up to my chin
I got arrested on a whim: Don't Touch That Dial!
You get service with a smile
And you call me on the phone at night
I'm feeling so excited to hear your voice
You're so out of control
You're like a rollercoaster ride
You're like a ride
Cut it up
Cut it out
