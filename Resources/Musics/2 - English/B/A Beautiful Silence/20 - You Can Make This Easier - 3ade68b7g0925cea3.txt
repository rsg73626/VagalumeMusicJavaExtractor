YOU CAN MAKE THIS EASIER

So youre the one playing favorites this time
Im not the one lingers in your mind
Im just a pawn in this game you play
I think its safe to say

If I should die tonight would you be surprised
Would you fall to your knees would you start to cry

Im standing tall but I fall so fast
Im losing touch this will never last

The ghosts of your victims the things that you did to them
Now the time has come to let you in on their fate

You can make this so much easier
Put the pieces together
You cant live forever
