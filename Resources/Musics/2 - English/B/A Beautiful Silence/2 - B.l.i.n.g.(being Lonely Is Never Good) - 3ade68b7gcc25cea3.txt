B.L.I.N.G.(BEING LONELY IS NEVER GOOD)

Another minute goes by
I stand here yeh im living this lie
Watching the clock as the angels rise
I dont want this dirty money
I wont take part in spreading envy
To find what greed is just follow the dirty paper trail
Hate spreads so rapidly
But I hold on to this catastrophe
I cant shake what wont bury me
I wont forget this tragedy
Were not who we think we are

Ive got three steps til I reach this door
