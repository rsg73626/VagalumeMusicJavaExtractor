WAITING FOR YOU TO RIP MY HEART OUT

She enters the room so calm and composed,
Shes got one thing on her mind as she makes her approach, and her lipstick it glistens like the moonlight,
And one kiss will bring you to your knees tonight.

Hello i know shes wasting your time,
Hello i know shes tearing out your spine,
And if this keeps up you know shell destroy your mind
And ill be waiting

Now that shes got you right where she wants you,
She'll take everything shes got nothing to prove,
And her lipstick is stained across your collar,
And one kiss youll swear that you love her.

Hello i know shes wasting your time,
Ello i know shes tearing out your spine,
And if this keeps up you know shell destroy your mind
And ill be waiting
