GOING PLACES

So its been said, that I wont make it on my own
But I know, that im going places that youll never know
And one day youll find me hiding, on your back porch 

And I see through these lies, should I end it with this knife
Ive seen the things you do, don’t know what you’ve got to prove
Does this mean anything to you, does this mean anything to you 

Now its too late, for an apology, not its too damn late for an apology. 

And I see through these lies, should I end it with this knife
Ive seen the things you do, don’t know what you’ve got to prove
Does this mean anything to you, does this mean anything to you?
