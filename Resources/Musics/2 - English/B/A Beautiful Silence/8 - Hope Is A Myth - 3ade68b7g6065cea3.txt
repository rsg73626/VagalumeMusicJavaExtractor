HOPE IS A MYTH

The words your about to hear 
Tell a tale thats all too clear
Based on true events 
This story ends with you

We wait for something hopeful

If memories could tell lies
Then all our wrongs would be rights
And wed bet our lives 
On Games that we should stay away

Now I could sit here and watch you go by
Like the stars in the sky you shine so bright
The temperature is rising but hey its surprising that we met

So you just wait and see
The things you do to me
I wont let you fall
