SAY HELLO TO HISTORY FOR ME

Ignorance is bliss and so commonly linked to our memories
When hope becomes just a word that has no meaning anymore
When theres nothing left to hope for

History has a tendency of repeating 
Confidence has a consequence and its pushing
Me over the edge and Ive been thinking that this will never end
Ive got the confidence to do this but something is holding me back

So ill say my prayers
Hold my breathe
Cross my heart
Set my mind free

Feelings keep building never release me
From these hollow walls that are built and fall around me
When life becomes just a thing that ends before it begins
And our children slit their wrists beneath our parkways

I wont forget who I am because this is where I find compassion
I wont forget who I am and every day I keep on wishing
