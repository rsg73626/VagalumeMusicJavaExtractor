I WON'T LET YOU GO

You pay for the things you have with kisses you stole from me
This conversation is breaking me

I wont let you go for anything 

Ill put on my happy face pretend everything will be ok
You substitute me for the next best thing ill always be your next best thing

I wont let you go for anything

Youll be the death of me in time Ill let you know

Your eyes are the reason my heart is beating
Your smiles the reason that I keep breathing
Your love is the reason that I keep screaming out
