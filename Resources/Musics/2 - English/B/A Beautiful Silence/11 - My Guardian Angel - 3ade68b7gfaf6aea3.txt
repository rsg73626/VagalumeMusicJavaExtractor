MY GUARDIAN ANGEL

the way your hair falls across your face,
has always been a mystery to me,
i dont know why sure as hell dont know how,
you seem to know everything,
but maybe you've been here all along,
and maybe i've done something so wrong that you just cant seem to let it go,
why can't you just let me go. 

i've lost it again and,
im running scared as, your falling from heaven,
to save me from sin and,
the life i lost. 

these imperfections lead in all directions but youve always kept me bold and clean,
and my misfortune is your disappointed as you usher this boy through his life,
and when did i become so relient on everything you say to me, this is my disaster and im falling faster so wont you just let me be. 

i've lost it again and,
im running scared as,
your falling from heaven,
to save me from sin and,
the life i lost. 

you take my pain away,
your my guardian angel,
you take my pain away,
your my guardian angel. 

i've lost it again and, im running scared as, your falling from heaven, to save me from sin and, the life i lost.
