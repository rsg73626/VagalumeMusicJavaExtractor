WHEN IN DOUBT

I call out your name
when running in circles
is all I can do.
I m playing these games
of certain delusions
revolved around you

looking down
falling into
your eyes

I m playing these games of circles
when in doubt of how this really is
I just look
and in your eyes is where I can
see the truth
running in circles
in you

You call out my name
When running in circles is all you can do
is all you can do
you re playing these games
of hurtful delusions
when no one wants you

looking down
falling into
your eyes

I m playing these games of circles
when in doubt of how this really is
I just look
and in your eyes is where I can
see the truth
running in circles
in you
