PROMISES

and I sometimes,
fall victim to the
whirlwind of life 
letting go
doesn't mean I'm letting go
(I won't let go)
and all respite
may have seemed
ill conceived at the time
tragedy is what I'm fighting
so I'm leaving
(my heart will stay)
remember, if you ever
hear this on the radio
I m promising
That if you ever need
me I'll be there

I promise you that I'll be there
I m promising

(fate sometimes smiles)
and second chances
fall from the sky 
snatching you
from the jaws of  nothing 
and beauty saves
muted hearts, silent dreams
reminding me when I
thought I lost it all 
my heart s bleeding
(and promises)
made before
are calling to me
and so I have to go
but I m promising
that if you ever need me
I'll be there

I promise you that I'll be there
I'm promising
