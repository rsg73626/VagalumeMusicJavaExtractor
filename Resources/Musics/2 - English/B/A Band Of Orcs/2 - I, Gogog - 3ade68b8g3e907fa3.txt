I, GOGOG

My father
my chieftain
my leader in war
War
I'm standing victorious
I'm splattered in Gore
In Gore
I stand above you
And now I'm splattered in gore
I will ascend
Lamenting end
Our father
our chieftain
our leader is dead
Dead
I, Gogog, the Bloodthroat
And now I stand instead
My tribe
my Blood-kin
look unto me
I set him free
I stand above you
And now I'm splattered in gore
I will ascend
Lamenting end
All for the tribe
All for our way of life
We kill to take control
Only the strong prevail
Our kin
I am leader
I am leader
I, Gogog
I, Gogog
I, Gogog
God....
