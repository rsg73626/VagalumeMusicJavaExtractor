EYE CRY FIRE

Is it true the way that you feel
Was i your wound that just wouldnâ€™t heal
Am i making your tears fall
Am i making your life so empty
I hurt you one too many times
Is your heart still there and beating
Cause i cant seem to hear it sing
Are you still angry and bleeding
Eye cry the fire that burned us up
And left this world in ashes
The fall has fallin
But the debris remains
Unlike the leaves
I will not change x2
Was i your one mistake
Was i the pain that you couldnt take
And this is the note you left me
My tears are making this ink bleed
Looking up again i see
The gray cover our faces
And the cold blankets our hearts
And the sea that divide these places
Eye cry the fire that burned us up
And left this world in ashes
Chorus
Is it true the way that you feel
Am i your wound that just couldnt heal
Am i causing your tears to fall
Am i making your life so empty
A bedtime lie to close our eyes
And put us all to sleep
So we may never see or wake
And take a breath to speak
A truth that this day will end
And bring us no tomorrow
You and i
We will never see the light
Chorus
