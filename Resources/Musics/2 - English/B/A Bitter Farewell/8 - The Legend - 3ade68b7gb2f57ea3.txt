THE LEGEND

I took a swing at a legend and almost paid the price
Your underestimation is what saved my life
Lay dying with tears in my eyes
My blood hands drop
This wound was not fatal
But the pain will never stop

You thought you killed me years ago
Hear I am before
Unfinished tale end before the night is....

I took a swing at a legend and now he hits the ground
You never had an equal, but an equal you have found
Now you lay disbelief in your eyes
Your blood begins to drop
That wound is fatal and soon the pain will stop

I took a swing at a, at a legend
I took a swing at a, at a legend
I took a swing at a, at a legend
And I made him pay the price
