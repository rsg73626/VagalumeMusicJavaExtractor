BLASTER VS GUNNER

So many tears will fall today
And there will be sorrow

You can not shield this from me
You can not take this away it is mine

You said bridges will burn, people will let you down
And love inside us will not last forever

I have so much to say and
I have only one shakey breath

You can not shield this from me
You can not take this away it is mine

You said bridges will burn, people will let you down
And love inside us will not last forever

And love will not last forever...
My heart, it beats in the shadow of a lie
