I CHOOSE PISTOLS

By high noon tomorrow
Holstered pistols will fly again
And with a quick flash bang
Yet another life will be brought to an end

But I will always remain
These scars are my history

Is this my destiny?
To end evil
One bullet at a time
Cause there is no end in sight


Six lead friends of mine
Will make their homes in all the hearts
In all of those who stood against me
Now ill prove this once again

Between you and I
Gunsmoke and sunlight
You hesitate
But Im already all over the trigger
And I send out my condolences
To the widow
To the widow
I make this vow to never, to never kill again
