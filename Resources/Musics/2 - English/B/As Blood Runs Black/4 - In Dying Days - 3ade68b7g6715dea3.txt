IN DYING DAYS

Leaders are hard to come by, followers are omnipresent
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle
Satisfied

No one is setting a path for us to follow
No one's striving to be on top
No one is setting a path for us to follow we will all fall in the end
In dying days

The path has been set, you're leading far astray
Far astray
The path has been set, you're leading far astray
Far astray
In darkness

Unfortunate as you may be, you'll never see the light
Someone must rise above, someone must precede
Unfortunate, you must precede
Unfortunate

Leaders are hard to come by, followers are omnipresent
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle
Satisfied

No one is setting a path for us to follow, we will all fall in the end
In dying days
As the time to rise approaches
No one will take responsibility
