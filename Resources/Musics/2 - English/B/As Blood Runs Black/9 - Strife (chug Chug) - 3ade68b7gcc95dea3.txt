STRIFE (CHUG CHUG)

The risk of failure's what makes life worth living a chance is given for more 
Doors can shut to make new beginnings another chance to explore 
Explore! 
Strive for more! 
Would you carry out what you walked through? 
Would you carry out and make fucken move? 
A blane life you live, walking on what you made took shit for granted, and threw it all away 
Then along came 1, then 1 and 3, then 1 more a set to see, a set to see 
You tried to push us away, you pushed it away, you pushed it all away, pushed us away! 
The risk of failure's what makes life worth living, a chance is given for more 
Doors can shut to make new beginnings, and I'm not depressed from it 
It's just you fucken testament! 
We tried over and over again, to pull you through, 
Now we're at the very end but where are you another band, a fallen dream, another outcast, another 1 to a band, a fallen dream, a fucken outcast! 
Now that your gone we carry out this torche, the one you threw away with no remorse. 
No fuel to light the fire, but we're still going strong! 

GOING STRONG! 
GOING STRONG!
