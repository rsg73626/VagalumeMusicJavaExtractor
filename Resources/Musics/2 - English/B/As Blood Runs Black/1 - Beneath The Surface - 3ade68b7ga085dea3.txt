BENEATH THE SURFACE

Judged by appearance, and misspoken words 
Not the content of one's character, just by what you heard 
Have you heard of rumors? 
Some clash with lies 
One degrades another out of despite 
Inhumanity 

[chant:] how can one 
Claim to be perfect despite the things he has done 
[chant:] how can one 
Be so blind to see, you're no fucking different than me 
Different than me 
Maybe it's me, I'm not trying to change the world 
But actions speak louder than words 
And all in time I'll learn from the mistakes that are mine 
But I wont forget those mistakes done unto me 
Done unto me 

Who am I to judge, use judgmental words? 
What matters is appearance? 
Or what you heard? 
Live by what you have and believe 
Judge by appearance, and misspoken words, 
Not the content of one's character, just by what you heard 

Have you heard of rumors? 
Some clash with lies 
One degrades another out of despite 
Out of despite 
I'm human 
I'm not perfect just like you
