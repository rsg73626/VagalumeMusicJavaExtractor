THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF SUFFERING

A struggle of change that is made 
A wrinkle in time, battle of the brave 
Fighting for hope of one's beliefs 
Deceiving thought planted in minds 
When hell freezes over will come the time 
That one's point will have been made 
There's shattered thoughts, and broken dreams 
Wasted lives all for the brighter side of suffering 

There's more than fighting for cause 
There's fighting for what you believe 
If there's a fork in the road of your path 
Ne side needles the other's glass 
At least you're walking instead of dragging on what's paved 
Some see the glass half empty, others full 
I just see the water's cold 
And so is this world that we live in 
Ans so I segregate 
Separated from the ones without a cause 
I segregate 
I segregate 
Would would you believe? 
Could you believe? 
There's more to this than what it seems 
It's the brighter side of suffering 
Poverty, injustice, struggling with the pain 
A humble mind of wisdom and non-corruption 
Would you believe? 
There's more to this from this life 
There's more to this 
Finding a solution 
Hope for tomorrow, for a better today 
A new revolution 
We stand and fight and face the pain
