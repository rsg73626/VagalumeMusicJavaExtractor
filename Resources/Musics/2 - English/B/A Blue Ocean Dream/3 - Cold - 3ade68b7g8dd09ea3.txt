COLD

Sometimes you question me, sometimes I question myself
You don't know what to believe, I don't know how to
reach

Sometimes I feel so cold
And it's just grab and hold
Sometimes I feel your soul
And it's just touch and go

Sometimes we're far apart, and yet we stand so close
I know it's there in your heart, it's just to hard to
show

Sometimes I feel so cold
And it's just grab and hold
Sometimes I feel your soul
And it's just touch and go
