FALL DOWN

Let the rain come down
Fall down on me

I saw the leaves falling to the ground
I saw the snow falling all around
Stop and reflect on the time that we have left 
Is it a crossing when you stand in front of death

Let the rain 
Come down
Fall down on me
Let the rain 
Come down
Fall down on me

Like tears
Like tears

I saw the leaves falling to the ground
Just like tears
I saw the snow falling all around
Just like tears

Let the rain 
come down
Fall down on me
Like tears
Let the rain 
come down
Fall down on me
Like tears
