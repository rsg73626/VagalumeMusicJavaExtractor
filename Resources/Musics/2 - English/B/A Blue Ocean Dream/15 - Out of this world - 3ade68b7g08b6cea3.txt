OUT OF THIS WORLD

They came from a distant place
A zillion miles from outer space
They took control over land and sea
Intergalactic philosophy

They were out of this world

They had the strength of a million men
No one dared to challenge them
They were ancient as the sun
They didn't need any lazergun

They were out of this world

They had something we did not
They never missed a hundred-to-one-shot
They had manners and their language swirled
