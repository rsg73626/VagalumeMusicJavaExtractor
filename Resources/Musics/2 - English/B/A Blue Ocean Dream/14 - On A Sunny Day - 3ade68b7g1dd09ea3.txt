ON A SUNNY DAY

And all the things that I forgot to say
I'll make it up to you on a sunny day

Everytime I think of you
My heart beats just like a drum
To the tune to the melody
It sticks just like bubblegum

And all the things that I forgot to say
I'll make it up to you on a sunny day
And all the times the moment past away
I'll give'm back to you on a sunny day

Everytime I think of you
My heart beats just like a drum
To the tune to the melody
It sticks just like bubblegum

And all the things that I forgot to say
I'll make it up to you on a sunny day
And all the times the moment past away
I'll give'm back to you on a sunny day
