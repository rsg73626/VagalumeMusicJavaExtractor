PEOPLE UNITE

People unite, people stand up, look at ourselves, & what we´ve become

We build our lives our society, on information technology
We put our trust in bits & bytes, power consumption, turn off the lights
Too many options for us to care, too many choices vanish in the air
What´s it good for, have we lost the way, things that matters have they come astray?

People unite, people stand up, look at ourselves, & what we´ve become
People unite, people stand up, look at ourselves, & what we´ve become

Our lives are spinning way too fast, no common sense reflect the past
Where are we heading no one can tell, are we too scared to brake the spell

People unite, people stand up, look at ourselves, & what we´ve become
People unite, people stand up, look at ourselves, & what we´ve become
