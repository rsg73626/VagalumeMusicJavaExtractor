DOWN TO VEGAS

I'm on my way, down to Vegas, driving my sedan, down
the highway
I feel luck, I can get the cash, it's very simple,
gonna get rich

Going nowhere
Being selfcruel, running low on fuel
No job no money
Feels like I'm stuck, running out of luck
Always tomorrow
Got to stay on track, never looking back
Hope for the break now
From a long decay, see the sun today

I see roads, dust, and tumbleweed
I see trucks, bikes, and gasstations
I cross rivers and canyons and mountains
I see fields, motels, and hitchhikers 

Going nowhere
Being selfcruel, running low on fuel
No job no money
Feels like I'm stuck, running out of luck
Always tomorrow
Got to stay on track, never looking back
Hope for the break now
From a long decay, see the sun today

I see roads, dust, and tumbleweed
I see trucks, bikes, and gasstations

Going nowhere
Being selfcruel, running low on fuel
No job no money
Feels like I'm stuck, running out of luck
Always tomorrow
Got to stay on track, never looking back
Hope for the break now
From a long decay, see the sun today
