HERE WE GO AGAIN

Stop thinkin people's on your jock
Tryna act like you got money but you at the bus stop
Oh please stop doin what you do 
Cause ain't nobody lookin at you
[two times]

oh oh no no here we go again (again)
oh oh no, oh no 
stop doin what you do cause ain't nobody lookin at you

[1st verse]
When I pulled up in my ride it was four fly girls sittin on the side
So I glanced to my left and I winked my eye but they wasn't lookin 
our way
So I rolled over there and tried to spit but the main pigeon was 
tryna diss
So I stepped to my right and said excuse me miss but ain't nobody 
talkin to you so

Stop thinkin people's on your jock
Tryna act like you got money but you at the bus stop
Oh please stop doin what you do 
Cause ain't nobody lookin at you 
[two times]

[chorus twice]
oh oh no no here we go again
seen you at the bus stop chillin wit ya friends
oh no you thought I was tryna get wit you 
but I was really lookin at your friend
(I really want the digits from your friend)

[2nd verse]
When i pulled up the light was red
Romeo hit the brakes and then he said
Look at the girl in the pink
b2k what you think
I said she look real cute in them jeans
Had me and my boys startin to fiend
So she turned around I said turn back around
But you ain't what I'm lookin for

Stop thinkin people's on your jock
Tryna act like you got money but you at the bus stop
Oh please stop doin what you do 
Cause ain't nobody lookin at you 
[two times]

[repeat chorus twice]

[third verse]
Baby girl you can stay confused
Cause I'm not talkin to you
You're not tight not right not my type so take a hike don't like
Don't like the way you fight wit me
Wit your vibe you can't get
Wit no guy so don't try
Don't try

[repeat chorus]

Stop thinkin people's on your jock
Tryna act like you got money but you at the bus stop
Oh please stop doin what you do 
Cause ain't nobody lookin at you 

[repeat chorus]
