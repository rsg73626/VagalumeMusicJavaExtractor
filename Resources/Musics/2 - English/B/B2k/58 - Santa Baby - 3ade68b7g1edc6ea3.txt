SANTA BABY

Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a drive top canten
Light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun i've missed
Think of all the fellas that i haven't kissed
Next year i could be just as good
If you'll check off my christmas list

Santa honey, i want a yacht and really that's not, alot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, there's one thing i really need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your "x" on the line
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonignt

Come and trim my christmas tree
With some decorations bought from tiffany's
I really do, believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forget to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight,
Hurry tonight
