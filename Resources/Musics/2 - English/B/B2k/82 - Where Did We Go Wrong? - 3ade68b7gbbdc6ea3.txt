We gone bump your speakers with this one
Yeah.............Uh
Y’all know who this is it’s B2K
Check it out
I wan to tall ya’ll about this girl
I don’t think she had it all
Cuase she had it all with me
But she left
Now she gotta another man
And if you still don’t understand
Raz talk to dem
Let them kno

[Verse 1:]
You was always trippin
For no reason
As if something was on your mind
Then when I asked you what was wrong
You carried on like we were fine
Then one day you up and leave
Like I forced you not to be with me
You and I both know what’s really going on
That’s why we broke up over the phone

[Hook:]
Hey girl
You didn’t have to ever leave
You choose 
To push yourself away from me
And I know
You want to see jealousy
I’m not that man

[Chorus 2x:]
Can I ask the question why 
We argue over
Stupid little things
We ain’t together
Why can’t be friends
Instead of fighting
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong

[Verse 2:]
I was your man
You where my girl
The relationship lasted to long
For you to just walk out without a sign
Tell me where did we go wrong
I seat thinking were you ever creepin
Cause you shocked so fast you never known
What drove me away from you
Your the crazy one play dumb, play dumb

[Hook:]
Hey girl
You didn’t have to ever leave
You choose 
To push yourself away from me
And I know
You want to see jealousy
I’m not that man

[Chorus 2x:]
Can I ask the question why 
We argue over
Stupid little things
We ain’t together
Why can’t be friends
Instead of fighting
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong

[Hook 2x:]
Hey girl
You didn’t have to ever 
You choose 
To push yourself away from me
And I know
You want to see jealousy
I’m not that man

[Repeat chorus 4x]

[J-Boog talking:]
Yo
I need to ask you a question
Why do we always gotta argue when we talk
We not even together anymore
At least we can be friends or something
You acting all brand new
Dang
I don’t care about him
Cause I got me a girl too
It don’t matter
You know what I'm saying
We can go on double dates if you want too
I just want to know why you trippin out on me
You need to fix your attitude
Just cause I aint’ your man
Don’t mean I would get in your aaaaaaaa
Yeah
You betta understand that
I’m still that 
Uhhhh
You betta act like you know
You betta tell him
Cause if you don’t I will
I run this 
AND I AIN’T PLAYINNNNNN
