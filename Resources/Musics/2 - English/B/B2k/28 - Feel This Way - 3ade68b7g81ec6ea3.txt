FEEL THIS WAY

[Chorus]
Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

"Like best friends" were the words you said to me
Got me wondering to myself how could this be
They way we touched. was more than a fantasy
Just knew that what we had was more reality
My wifey is who I thought you'd be
Maybe one day raise a C-H-I-L-D
Broke my heart when you didn't wanna be with me
And all this time I was a fool in L-O-V-E

[Chorus]
Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

Beautiful, baby that was you and I
Now everyday I got to sit and wonder why
The way we kissed, got a feeling deep inside
What I'm hearing girl, it has to be a lie
How can you, just keep me to the side
You never even gave this thing a T-R-Y
Don't understand these feelings you try to hide
Now all the sudden you been actin f-u-n-n-y
(omit)

How could you do this to me
You led me to believe you want me
Now I cant change how I feel inside
Girl tell me why

[Chorus]
Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

Oh yea
Baby
You wanted me...You wanted me

[Chorus]
Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you want to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends
