CAN I GET IT BACK?

(talking)
hold up! new release, frum the barrel of brooklin,
three ladies call xso, cafe lets go!

Cafe:
Hold up freeze! i just wanna get between ur knees
Thats too much to ask im in the breeze
Roof top gone
Gooche top on got hot like pop corn shit!
Kinda lucky u got me
Look, ma u'd be nuthin without me
Them debit cards easily revoke
Plus im frum the hood im easily prevoked
You wont get fresh on my account noooo
Ur name comes off of my account ooohh
And dont think i wont make that red dot give u pink
eye
Get outta here pop

Xso:
Now that we spilt up
U want me to give up
All that u gave
But what about my love in time
Can it be replaced
U never thought about me babe
I see u havent changed a bit
Cause ur still acting childish

Chorus:
Guess u've fergotten
I never was a silly chick(chick)
And u can never get back this so u can stop all the
callin, complainin, stressin or sumthin, or not
gettin,
All my love,(cant u get it back?)no i cant,
All my time,(cant u get it back?) no i cant,
So all ur rings,(cant u get it back?)no u cant,
All u gave,(cant u get it back?) no u cant.

Xso:
How can u blame me?
U took my love and ran away
Expecting me to feel guilty
But wat about my pain and tears?
Cant be replaced its all been erased
Want wat u want back i see u think im crazy...

Chorus:
Guess u've fergotten
I never was a silly chick(chick)
And u can never get back this so u can stop all the
callin, complainin, stressin or sumthin, or not
gettin,
All my love,(cant u get it back?)no i cant,
All my time,(cant u get it back?) no i cant,
So all ur rings,(cant u get it back?)no u cant,
All u gave,(cant u get it back?) no u cant.

Cafe:
Now all i need in this life of sin
Is a down ass chick and u aint it
Thought u was real but u aint shit
U can ride in the truck but u cant sit(ha)
See u must got me miconscrewed
???????
But if imma spend imma really spend
Ill put u on an island next to gilagin
And its way too late for the boo hoo's
Sorrie game over u lose
Tell ur new man i keeps mah rasco
And i got a new thorough chick to fed me tacos (haha)
