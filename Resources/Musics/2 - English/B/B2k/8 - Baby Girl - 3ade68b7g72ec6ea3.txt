BABY GIRL

[Verse 1:]
There are times when I look in your eyes, I see the love that wish I, I see the joy inside.
But I didn't see the feelings you had and now you saying goodbye cause your love is died.

And all I can think about is you. 
The way you say you love me too and everytime I close my eyes I see your face. 
My love can never be erased you can never be replaced.

[Chorus:]
Baby girl why don't you come back to me, why don't you love me anymore.
Baby girl you know I still care for you, you know I will love you forever more.


There are times when I kiss you goodnight, I feel the love that wish I, I feel the joy inside.
But I didn't feel what you try to I and now you saying goodbye cause your love is died.

And all I can think about is you. 
The way you say you love me too and everytime I close my eyes I see your face.
My love can never be erased you can never be replaced.

[Chorus:]
Baby girl why don't you come back to me, why don't you love me anymore.
Baby girl you know I still care for you, you know I will love you forever more.

Baby girl why don't you come back to me, why don't you love me anymore.
Baby girl you know I still care for you, you know I will love you forever more.

And all I can think about is you. 
The way you say you love me too and everytime I close my eyes I see your face.
My love can never be erased you can never be replaced.

[Chorus:]
Baby girl why don't you come back to me, why don't you love me anymore.
Baby girl you know I still care for you, you know I will love you forever more.

Baby girl why don't you come back to me, why don't you love me anymore.
Baby girl you know I still care for you, you know I will love you forever more.
