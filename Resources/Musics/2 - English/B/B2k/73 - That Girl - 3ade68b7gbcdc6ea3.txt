THAT GIRL

Yo can i talk to you for a minute? look, all i did was look, why u trippin look check this out check it

Verse 1
Baby look im tired of tryin
To convince you that i aint' cought up lyin
When she walked past me i looked so what big deal
I dont understand how that can make you feel,
That my love aint for real

Everyday i thank the lord above that your with me
Tell me why would i go that way?
What can i do to prove that this is where i wanna be
Though i may look occasionally
You're the only one i need

Chorus
If i wanted that girl
Then i would be with that girl
But that one aint for me
She's fine as hell but she'll always be that girl
And nothin more than that girl
No matter what she do she dont compare to you

Verse 2
What you gettin from how you treat me
Girl you act as if you just cought me cheatin
When you look at other men and dont act like you dont
I dont trip because i know that im the guy
You come home to every night

Everyday i thank the lord above that you're with me
Tell me why would i go that way
What can i do to prove that this is where i wanna be
Though i may look occasionally
You're the only one i need

Chorus
If i wanted that girl
Then i would be with that girl
But that one aint for me
She's fine as hell but she'll always be that girl
And nothin more than that girl
No matter what she do she dont compare to you

Oh i know i need you right here with me
Oh i know i need you
No other girl wont do
Cuz i need you right here with me
Oh i need you

Chorus
If i wanted that girl
Then i would be with that girl
But that one aint for me
She's fine as hell but she'll always be that girl
And nothin more than that girl
No matter what she do she dont compare to you
