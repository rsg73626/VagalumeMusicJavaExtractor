SLEEPIN'

[Verse 1:]
This is crazy
Cause lately
The only thing that I think about, dream about is
How you left
Why’d you leave me
See I was trippin just for thinking you would wait
around
How I'm missing
You baby
And how we used to be
How you were always there for me and
Your his now
But maybe
If we can talk it out
I can turn this thing around

[Hook:]
Always thought that you'd be (thought that you'd be)
With me only (yeah)
Now it's killing me slowly
How I took you for granted
But now i understand that i was 

[Chorus:]
Wrong for sleepin
Baby give me one more try
I swear I apologized
Wrong
And I’m trippin
I’m down on my knees
Come and see about me
Wrong for sleeping
All I need is one more chance
I just wanna be your man
Wrong for trippin
I can barely breath
Come and see about me

[Verse 2:]
Can I call you
Like I use too
I just can’t walk away
You still got a piece of me
So if its alright
Can I fall through
I need to see your face girl

[Hook:]
I just want to talk to you (talk to you yeah)
Can we spend some time (said baby can we spend a lil'
time)
What I gotta do (What I gotta do)
Cause I can’t get you off my mind

[Chorus:]
I was wrong for sleepin
Baby give me one more try
I swear I apologized
I was wrong
And I’m trippin
I’m down on my knees
Come and see about me
I was wrong for sleepin
All I need is one more chance
I just want to be your man
I was wrong for trippin
I can barely breath (barely breath)
Come and see about me

[Hook 2:]
Always thought that you would be (always thought that
you would be)
With me only (said with me with me yeah)
Now it's killing me slowly (yes it's killing me
slowly) said I was wrong

[Repeat chorus til end of song]
