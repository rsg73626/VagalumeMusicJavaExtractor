BACK UP (OFF THA WALL)

B2k ridin' around in 4 drop tops
It's a friday time to hit tha hot spot
Step in the club, all eyes on us
Lookin at the fellas that be doing wat too much
Tryna' hit the snack table to spike the fruit punch
I don't wanna take ya girl just give her a soft touch
Lil Fizz, Omarion, J-Boog, Raz B 15 n holdin' it down
for Cali

1st Verse-
The party's popin' off tonight
All my mami's lookin tight
They got their baby t's n saggin jeans
n there a couple of them lookin at me
So I took off my shades to beat the scene
Rolled out my wallet n flashed the cream
The dance floor is packed I see
n i came here to party

Chorus-
Get ya back up off the wall
All my people lets party all night long
Booty's shakin' all the fellas singin the song
Everybody throw ya hands n the air
n wave em' like you don't care
Get ya back up off the wall
All my people lets party all night long
Booty's shakin' all the fellas singin the song
Everybody throw ya hands n the air
n wave em' like you don't care

2nd Verse-
The playas n the house tonight
Ladies shakin' it from letf to right
Everybody's havin' a ball
But there's a couple of them standin' on the wall
So my fellas who be at the club
Go get you a girl n tell lil mami "shake ya
butt"
To my ladies girl get off the wall
Go get you a man n shake it like you know you can

Chorus-
Get ya back up off the wall
All my people lets party all night long
Booty's shakin' all the fellas singin the song
Everybody throw ya hands n the air
n wave em' like you don't care
Get ya back up off the wall
All my people lets party all night long
Booty's shakin' all the fellas singin the song
Everybody throw ya hands n the air
n wave em' like you don't care

Rap-
Never thought an ounce could get down like this
Got girls surrounding me like a lunar eclipse
Stop all that talkin got something better you can do
with yo lips
Cop whips n best of a phat chics
I'm 15 with a dream, nah i'm lying
I'm 15 with cream doin big things
F-I-Z-Z drop whines, drop dimes, drop hits
Man when I drop, it's ova wit
