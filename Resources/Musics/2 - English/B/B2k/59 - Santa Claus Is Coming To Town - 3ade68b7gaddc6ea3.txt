SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN

[Chorus:]
You better watch out 
you better not cry
you better not pout 
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge:]
He knows when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good 
So be good for goodness sake

[Repeat chorus]

[Verse:]
Little tin horns
And little toy drums
A rooty-toot-toot
And a rumpa-bum-bum
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge 2:]
The kids and girls in boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're going to build a toyland
All around the Christmas tree

[Repeat chorus]

[Fizz's Rap]
I hit Santa on two-way
To see if he coming through-ay
He hit me back with a message
Yo I'm stuck in St.Louis
He says
Be patient Fizz 
I'll be on my way
Two seconds later I hear this fool
Coming down my chim-a-ney
What happened to Rudolph
You not cool with him no more
Man that fool old and slow
Had to take the '64
Anyway, here's your ice
Where my ride
outside
Where's my dime
My bad dog 
Yo I got you next time 
FA SHO

[Repeat chorus]
