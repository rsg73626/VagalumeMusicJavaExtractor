TAKE YA HOME BY BOW WOW

From the C-O to across the seas 
I'm guaranteed to everybody bounce w me 
Been known to put it down anyplace I be 
You can copy but it's only gon' be one me 
I don't ride in no cars till a man come wit me 
14 and i started up a whole epidemic 
Look, ya'll know what I'm talkin about 
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south 
TV shows, magazine covers 
Girls in groups sayin, "We go w each other." 
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake 
What you know about selling tres mil out the gate? 
I'm the hottest thang around 
Neck full of bling, bling like the neptune sound 
I got it locked on the left, right, front
