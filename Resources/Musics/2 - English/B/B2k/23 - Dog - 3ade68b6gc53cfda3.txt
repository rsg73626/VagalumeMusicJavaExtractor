DOG

verse 1 

You thought 
I was 
In the dark ( no no never me)
Baby boy 
From the start (you was trippin) 
I was asking questions to see 
If you was creepin 
For no reason (at all)
I am acusing you of cheatin no matter what you saying 
Its so irrating so baby stop playin

chorus 

Dog
Tryna run your game on me (you're a dog)
Thinkin you can cheat on me (you're a dog)
Boy you know you lost my trust (your a dog)
And I know it's obvious (your a dog)

repeat 

verse 2

I heard you say you were gonna push up on her 
I played along boy you think im stupid 
I'm on point no i don't miss a damn thang 
Fed up but Jhene ain't foldin
Think i don't know but she is my dog yeah
I got my friend on you tellin her to call
You got caught and now I know that your a dog

repeat chorus 2 times

Lil Fizz rap

i'm a d-o-g from the t-u-g
it's hard tryna be F-i-double z
i'm the jay-z of my generation
so sick i'm every hospitals #1 patient
girls be killin me with they fantasies
when all i really wanted was the ???
2 minutes of conversation and you're out of contol
i'm a d-o-g ain't no changin me

Think i didn't know (you were playin games on me) 
Tried to play me for a fool (I'm your new enemy)
You're barkin up the wrong tree 
Now you turned into my enemy
