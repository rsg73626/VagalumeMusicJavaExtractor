B2K IS HOT

(B2k 2001 câ€™mon)

B2K got the ladies jumpin'
Keep the party bumpin'
And everybodyâ€™s sayinâ€™
B2k is hot 
The partyâ€™s rippin and 
Aint nobody trippinâ€™
and all my fellas chillinâ€™ like

Repeat twice


~*Omarion*~
Step in the party lookin' tite tonight
Got all the ladies given eyes tonight
You know I drove my CL5 tonight
And so you know the ladies wanna ride tonight

So I proceeded to hit the dance floor
Got the ladies pullin' my clothes
Sayin' gimmie some more
I say it's gettin' kinda crazy
I'm sayin' take it slow 
But she wouldn't stop trippin'
So I had to go

Repeat chorus twice


~*Omarion*~
Up in the place I'm on the move you see
Got all the ladies wanna grove with me
I see my fellas in the V.I.P
And so I say yall gotta come a party with me

So we proceeded to hit the dance floor 
Got the ladies pullin' my clothes sayin' gimmie some
more
I say it's gettin' kinda crazy
I'm sayin take it slow
But they wouldn't stop trippin 
So we have to say

Repeat chorus twice

~*Lil Fizz*~
Hops out the CL5
To a standing ovation
It's me Lil Fizz
Top playa number 1 in your nation
Got chicks chasin' me
Half-Black and Asian 
Get their number
Page em'
Game em'
Replace em' 
With another dime 
At the same time
They all wanna be with me
Screamin' my name we go
F~I~Z~Z
On the phone with they friends
Like how cool is he

Repeat chorus twice untill fade out
 
B2k instead of bringin the beat 
We keep bringin the heat
We keep movin your feet
Like b2k B2K is hot
And we click         
And we sick
Pop ya colla
And thatâ€™s it
