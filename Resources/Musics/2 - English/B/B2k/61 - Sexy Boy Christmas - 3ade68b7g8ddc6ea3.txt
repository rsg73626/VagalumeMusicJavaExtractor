SEXY BOY CHRISTMAS

[TG4]
Sexy, Boy

[Chorus]
Sexy Boy, Sexy Boy
Sexy Boy, Sexy Boy

[Lil Fizz]
Oh, I'm a sexy boy
With fly whips and toys
S-5, knowing hard type
You sayin "Oh boy"
Lookin sick in my j shorts and throw back
Lookin at yo man now you wanna throw em back
Cause I'm too sick for medicine to help
And I'm just too cocky
I'm sorry I can't help but uh
Listen babe I don't mean no harm
I guess you could just say
I'm a lucky charm

[Chorus 2x]

[Omarion]
Sexy boy who?
You talkin to me?
Please keep me awake
Before I go to sleep
Hang time too long
Game time too strong
So if yo girl is lookin
Please don't be alarmed
I can't explain what I do to them
What they do to me
It's all in C-H-A-N-G-E
Reaction like a reflex
And if ya gonna...
Just gimme a minute
And everything will turn out lovely (lovely)
And everything will turn out lovely

[Raz-B]
Now you know me, I'm the ladies man
Raz-B came to serve you with these lips again
Who but me?
Sexy wit no flaws
Hittin the spot
And drop the girls....
It's just the little things I wanna
Do for y'all
Let you push them things while we chill at the mall
We can make our way to the mistletoe
And stand there and kiss
While I seduce you with this song

[Chorus 2x]

[J-Boog]
I'm not tryna show you love and affection
I'm tryna show you I'm blessed in different sections
Yo, let's see what this boy's all about
Cause this Christmas Eve
I'm tryna kick it on the couch
You better not pout
You better not cry
You better not shout
I'm tellin you why
Cause J-boog's gonna freak ya tonight

[Chorus 4x]
[Music fades out]
