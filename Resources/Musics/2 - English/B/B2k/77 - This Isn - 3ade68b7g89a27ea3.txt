THIS ISN

when your eyes I see
what you mean to me
when you calling out my name

Boy you know that I
want you by my side
so why do you feel this way?

Can't you see...... that I
want you in..... my life
so if you want .....to stay
you gotta love me anyways

(CHORSE)
If you don't stop getta way
you're the one I adore
but I don't need your lies...anymore
all you do.. is breaking my heart
every day from the start
Boy this isn't love anymore

---BREAK---

Doesn't matter how
doesn't matter why
cause today's another day
Ever since thu time that when you said GOODBYE
don't you know I ment to say........

can't you see.....that I
want You in........my life
so if you want to stay....you gotta LOVE ME ANYWAYS

(CHORSE PART)

can't you see
me and U
how are love was never untrue
how was I suppose to know
Now there's nothin I can do
But I turn away
all across the way
Far away from you....(YOU)

Can't you see...... that I
want you in..... my life
so if you want .....to stay
you gotta love me anyways

(CHORSE)

THIS ISN'T LOVE ANYMORE
THIS ISN'T LOVE ANYMORE
