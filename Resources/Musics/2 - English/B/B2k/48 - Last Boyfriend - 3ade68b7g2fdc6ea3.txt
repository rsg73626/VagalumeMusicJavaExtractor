LAST BOYFRIEND

[Verse 1]
Why you gotta ask me 
Where I been
Why you gotta talk in 
That accusing tone
You think tha worst of me
You always think I'm 
Out doin you wrong
You gettin on my 
Nerves wit that
Always stressing me when
I'm not home
I really do care for you
But if you keep on girl
We won't last long

[Chorus]
I'm not your last boyfriend
Girl, drop that baggage
I won't have it
Stop trippin
I'm not cheatin
Please believe me
I'm not your last boyfriend
Dont talk to me like you talk tohim
Stop trippin
Stop yellin' and accusin'
Cause I'm not him

[Verse 2]
I really can't take all tha arguin
Can you talk to me
Without raising your voice
Cause I'm not understandin you
Sounds like you just
Makin a lot of noise
I didn't get down with you
For you to charge me with 
Tha things he did
Could you please just 
Forget tha past
Cause I just can't take much more of this

[Chorus]
[Repeat]

[Bridge]
Girl I do love you 
And you know that I do
But I can't keep on arguin with you
And you say you've been hurt
And I know that it's true
But I can't keep on paying for what
I didn't do

[Rap (Lil' Fizz)]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
You need to stop comparing
Cause I don't act like
Don't look like
Don't sound like
I'mma treat you right
Got a little more to show
Got more to blow
Talkin bout more than the one before
That scrub gotcha, gotcha head all
Messed, up
Gotcha, gotcha rejectin my love
Got me, got me in your situation
Stuck, stop

[Repeat chorus 3 times]
