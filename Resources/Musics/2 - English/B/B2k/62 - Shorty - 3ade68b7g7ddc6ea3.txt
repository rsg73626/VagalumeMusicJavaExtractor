SHORTY

Shorty, what's 55 in calicable
Lookin' like a model from the cover of Vogue,
Sexy mama body bangin' out of control,
She Lookin' at me but I ain't fa show,
She was da hottest girl I'd eva seen before,
Said to myself, "Gotta get her fa show!",
Stepped up to her with my playa approach
and said Hey Little Lady Please Give Me Your Name 
and

[Chorus]
Wat^ there Shorty, Lookin' Sexy in your jeans there Shorty,
Got me actin' like a feen there
Shorty, So girl won't you come and be my Shorty. (be my Shorty)
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]

For da first 5 minutes she was sweatin' me,
but I could tell that she liked the way I sagged my jeans,
I said sweety do wanna take a ride wit me,
Told my boys that she could be da one for me,
So I said baby can I be da man you need,
Holla at me mommy if you feelin' me,I wispered in
her ear and she smiled at me,
I said hey little Shorty won't you be my girlfriend.

[Chorus (2x)]

[Lil Fizz:]
Cadidy and pretty just how I like 'em,
When a girl talk mess she always down to fight 'em,
Thug appeal da's real,
She don't say hi she like yo what's da deal?,
Girl da pop colla, gotta make her own dolla,
She don't like a Benz she like a 6'4 Impala,
One that can hold her own,
Sneak me in when Pop's is home,
Talk about prom, and Say she love me in a sexy tone.

[Chorus 4x]
Wat^ there Shorty?......Got me actin' like a feen there Shorty,....
Be my Shorty.
Yeahhhhh, yeah yeahah, Jeans there Shorty,
Be my Shorty. (be my Shorty)
Wat^ there Shorty, Lookin' Sexy in ya jeans there Shorty,
Got me actin' like a feen there
Shorty, So won't you come and be my Shorty.
(be my shorty) Come On, Come On

[Chorus]
We Out.
