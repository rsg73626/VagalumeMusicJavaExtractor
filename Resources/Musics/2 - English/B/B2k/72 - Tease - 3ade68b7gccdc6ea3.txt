TEASE

(feat. jhene & romeo)
[j-boog talk]
Ahh, yea
Yo, sup girl what you gon do
I mean are we gon do it or what
You keep trippin, you keep slippin
Acting like, you wanna get wit it
But cha wont get wit it, so get wit it
Naw
Ahh lets go

[verse #1 omarion]
How’d you get ya jeans so low (and)
Hanging on ya hips oh no (you)
Walking by me nice and slow (you)
Acting like you just don’t know (that)
I’ve been watching all the time(you)
Bending over blowing minds (you be)
Dancing on me tryin’ grind (but you)
Dont be giving up your time

[bridge jhene]
Shorty what’s up,i’m just saying
Wanna hook up, I ain’t playing
What cha gon do, I’m just waiting
Think I’m acting up, hey

[chorus]
She could claim and she play games
But I bet she couldnt hang (not wit me)
Ooo she’s a tease ooo
She be acting like she dont
But I know she really want (get wit me)
Ooo she’s a tease ooo

[verse #2 omarion]
(you be) always sitting on my lap
(and uh) girl you cant be doing that
(if uh) you don’t wanna deal wit me
(then ya) mind as well forget the tapes
Calling me wit all that talk (and ya)
Working on that sexy walk (but if)
You ain’t tryin’ get wit me
Then you need to go leave it be

[rap romeo]
Stop it please
You’s a tease
How a girl like you gon try to play me
Wasnt trippin when I was spending doe in frankies
Forget about you girl you should do me
Just let me touch I’ll even cut
Girl I promise planters ain’t got nothing on my nutz
Mess wit me you must have some kind of gutz
I’m not your normal dude
I’m one you can trust
There’s gotta be a offer that you cant refuse
I’m told enough girl there’s no way I can lose
When I got straight a’s up in the pimp school
