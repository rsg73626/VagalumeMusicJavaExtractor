I'M NOT FINISHED

I remember like it was yesterday
Had everything under control
Stayed out all night with my boys
I took advantage of your love
Then one day you beat my game
Now suddenly everything has changed
Never thought that you would go, oh, no
But now I'm missing you so

[Chorus]
If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
I don't wanna think of living without you
Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin you
Monica, Keisha, girl I'll let 'em go
Cuz they don't compare to you
I don't wanna spend another day without you
Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin you

I didn't know how much you meant to me
When I looked up you were gone
Now I realize you're my destiny
That's why I'm singing this song
Baby come back to me 
Down on my bended knee 
You are my everything 
Girl, I, I need you, I need you, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
I don't wanna think of living without you
Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin you
Monica, Keisha, girl I'll let 'em go
Cuz they don't compare to you
I don't wanna spend another day without you
Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin you

I'll do what I gotta do to get ya
To love me the way you did before
Before I was takin your love for granted
You're always on my mind
Every day, and every night
I think about how to make it right
All I wanna do is be with you
I gotta let you know
I miss, miss, miss, miss, you
I really miss, miss, miss, miss you
I wanna kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss you
Girl, I, I need you, I need you, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
I don't wanna think of living without you
Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin you
Monica, Keisha, girl I'll let 'em go
Cuz they don't compare to you
I don't wanna spend another day without you
Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin you
