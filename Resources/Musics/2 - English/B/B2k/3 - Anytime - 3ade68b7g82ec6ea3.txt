ANYTIME

ohhhhhhh hmmm

i cant remember why we fell apart
from somethhing that was so meant to be (yea yea)
forever was the promise in our hearts
now more and more i wonder where you are

((chorus))
do i ever cross your mind
anytime
do you ever wake up reaching out for me
do i ever cross your mind
anytime
i mss you

i still have your pisture in a frame (mmhmm)
i hear your footsteps down the hall
i swear i hear your vioce driving me insane
how i wish that you would call to saaayyy-

((chorus))
do i ever cross your mind
anytime
do you ever wake uo reachin out for me
do i ever cross your mind
anytime

(nooooo moooorrrreee) crying myself to sleep
(noooo ooooohh whooaaa) wonderin about tomorrow
