THE OTHER GUY

[Verse 1]
Its another day 
of you trippin out on me
I could retaliate and bring the ghetto outta me
But I feelin you
and not the things you do
I would rather set you straight 
then smack you in your face
This is not your ex-relationship
cause all I gotta say is

[Chorus]
Girl you just don't realize
you gotta figure out Im not like the other guy
Because I wear saggy jeans tim boots and don't lie like rest do
You gotta figure out I'm not like the other guy

[Verse 2]
there is no reason for 
all these crazy confrontations
lets set the record straight
your the only one for me
But true at heart Iam
please just understand
(okay Look)
First I gave you up
then I played the role 
then I fell in love with you girl

[Chorus]
Girl you just don't realize
you gotta figure out Im not like the other guy
Because I wear saggy jeans tim boots and don't lie like rest do
You gotta figure out I'm not like the other guy

[Hook]
Heartfelt
Unselfish
Love
all thoughts 
revolve around you

[J-Boog Talking]
Uh
I mean 
I just don't understand
I mean
I know what you hadand what you been through
But Im hear and Im different

[Chorus]
Girl you just don't realize
You gotta figure out Im not like the other guy
Because I wear saggy jeans tim boots and don't lie like the rest do
