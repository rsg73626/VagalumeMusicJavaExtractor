(Ohhhh) (Yeah, Uh) (I love u) (Check this out)

Verse 1

From day one u an' I've been friends
Hangin' out, havin' fun, chillin'
Now I know at times I got crazy silly ways an actin' shady
(Uh huh, check this out)
You peep things in me no one see's
Yo hold it down for she's easy
Now I have friends I thought were true
But no one more true than u
So, what am I gonna do

Hook

It took a while for me to see how special you've treated me

Chorus

Maybe that's the reason why I love u
Ur my heart, girl
An' wit all the crazy things that I do
Ur still here,girl
No one else can make me feel like you do
You share my world
Baby that's the reason why I love u

No other girl is quite like you
An' no one has my back like you do
Girl you 1 of a kind an' u blow my mind (Babe, uh)
An' I'm glad to say ur mine

Girl ur the 1 that changed me from a boy into a man
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
