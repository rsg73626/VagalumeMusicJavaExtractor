PRETTY YOUNG THING

Uh

Yo.........Check it out its’ B2K
Platinum Status
She’s a pretty young thing
pretty young thing
What
Uh

[Verse 1:]
She put it down
She put the thing on me
Without a doubt I know that she is wifey
Working it out
Making me feel freaky
But I don’t mind
She is all I need
Making them moves, keeping a brother thinking
I do the same
Keepin that aaaaaaa steaming
You know my name
Ain’t no replacing me
Cause I'm a man, and I'm all she needs

[Chorus:]
Pretty young thing
You give me loving
Why the others girl out derre buggin
You keep it coming
Pretty young thing
So understanding
You never need another man
But you with my life I'm planning
Cause through the rain
Your still my pretty young thing

She put it down
She put the thing on me
Without a doubt I know that she is wifey
Working it out
Making me feel freaky
But I don’t mind
She is all I need
Making them moves keep a brotha thinking 
I do the same
Keepin that aaaaaaa steaming
You know my name
Ain’t no replacing me
Cause I'm admitting I'm all she needs

[Chorus:]
Pretty young thing
You give me loving
Why the others girl out derre buggin
You keep it coming
Pretty young thing
So understanding
You never need another man
But you with my life I'm planning
Cause throw the rain 
Your still my pretty young thing

[Rap:]
I love girls screaming my name
While I'm spitting this game
Its hard to maintain
Doing a 100 in the slow lane
Seeing chicks go insane in the membrane
But through all of this,
Ma you never changed
Still like act vain
Still the same, plain Jane
Never think I'm cheating when my phone is outta range
These others girl are lame
They are not on the same page
Don’t believe your friends 
Your still my pretty young thing

[Repeat chorus]
