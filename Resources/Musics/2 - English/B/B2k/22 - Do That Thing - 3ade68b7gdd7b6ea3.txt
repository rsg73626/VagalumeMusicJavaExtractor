DO THAT THING

[lil kim and b2k]
Now what they go say
Now what you go do, do that thing its on you

(verse1)
Walked in the spot and i already picked one
My idea for the night is to get one
Or two, or three, five, six, seven if you leave it up to me
I'm down to get down wit cha
Wiggle,jiggle, turn it all around would ya uhh ohh
And let me get it mommy
Don't freeze be easy it's cool mommy

(hook)
There you go do that thing for me let it go from yo head to ya shouldas get a drink and come over after that we go head to
The rover

(chorus)
Back it up, clap it up, switch it up, change it up
Do that thing for me, do that thing for me
Flip it up, give it up, i'mma grip it up, while you rip it up
Do that thing for me,
Do that thing for me

Give me a minute want a swig of this pimp juice
I'mma be in it, when i'm in it there will be no use, for games, no games i don't need a lot, i got this on lock dog
