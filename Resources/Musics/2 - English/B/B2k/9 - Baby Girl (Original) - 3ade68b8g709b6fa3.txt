BABY GIRL (ORIGINAL)

( Verse 1 )
There are times when i look in your eyes
i see the love that we share
i see the joy inside
but i didn't see the felling you hide
and now your saying goodbye
because your love is done
and all i can think about is you
the way you say you love me too
and every time i close my eyes i see your face
my love can never be erased
if you can never be replaced
baby .

( Chorrus )

Baby girl

and all i can think about is you
the way you say you love me too
and every time i close my eyes i see your face
