FEELIN' FREAKY

Nick Talking]
Yo put the kids to bed
Yo Shawty..I know you aint scared

[Omarion]
B2k and Nick Cannon..
Trackmasters..the Pied Piper

[Verse One: Nick]
Yo' the freaks come out at night
I'm like Houdini with the magic stick
When you turn out the lights
Shawty grippin' my stomach tighter
When I burn out on the bike
Holla at the young thugs
What we doing tonight
I'm in the O.J. throwback jersey
Dressed to kill,Bridget won't get it
But Vanessa will,Vanessa's real
Shawty got sex appeal
You can hear this beat bangin from the exit still
Pied Piper, we need something for these chicks to
dance to
So look Mami Im trying to grind
I'm not trying to romance you
I'm just trying to get them pants loose
Lets get private, 2 way text me
T-Mobile sidekick
One-on-One lets talk and neglect the gossip
I'm as real as they come,Baby girl I got this
My wrist all numb, you can watch the watch gliss
We already bubbly we aint gotta pop Cris'

[Chorus: Omarion]
I come through
My style is powder blue
T's and nike shoes
Plus chicks by the deuce(uh huh)
Ain't no tellin what this man might do
'Cause tonight this man aint playing by the rules
So tell me...
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?(uh huh)
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?( uh huh)

[Verse Two: Nick]
We tearin' the club like them boys did in the roxy
Million dollar thug like I'm Ted D.B.I.C
Crack game on the plain
Probably think its Yahtzee
Wrist on rocky, How you gon stop me
Shawty like, "Papi", Crib like "Ozzy's"
Imma show you how to ball girl
