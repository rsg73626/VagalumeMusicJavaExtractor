SMELLS LIKE A PARTY

[O'RYAN]
Oh, oh, TU- O G
You know how we get down

T Scott on the track
Where you at Marques
O tell em what you're talking about

[Verse 1:]
I, step off into the party like a real O.G
Got a- bout 40 or 50 girls behind me
They all- must be waiting for my pool party
I'm just- tryin to find the one with the biggest booty
(Oh..damn!)
Bathing suits, tight bikinis
No alcohol, cuz i'm a little too young to drink
Got the crib to myself, let me think
What should i do
Why don't ya'll tell me

[Chorus:]
Ladies everywhere (Hey)
All the fellas everywhere (Ho)
Got the crib to ourself
What should we do?
Hmm

La, la, la, la, la, (hey)

La, la, la, la, la, (ho)
Smell that, come on
La, la, la, la, la, (hey)

La, la, la, la, la
It smells like a party ya'll

[Marques Houston:]
Oh
We're tryin to party with my man OG tonight
All the ladies put your hands in the air
Fellas, dance to this shit, come on

[Verse 2:]
I got on- all my ice made from Jacob the Jeweller
I'm home along feelin like Ferris Beuller
Mami, you're fine, but your friends much cuter (Oh my
God)
It doesnt matter cuz no one's a loser (Oh, yeah yeah)
So fresh so clean
Doing what i'm doing
Cuz theres this
One chick i'm thinkin of pursuing (Damn she's bad)
I can tell by her smile that shes thinkin the same
thing
So what should I do?
Why dont ya'll tell me

[Chorus:]
Ladies everywhere (Hey)
All the fellas everywhere (Ho)
Got the crib to ourself
What should we do?

[Rap: (Rufus Blaq)]
Yo mami lock your doors
No more kids allowed
Pull up in big trucks,
its me and houstons crowd
Escalades, range rovers
I put -- in my clothes
Ice around my neck, wrist
Down to my toes
Hypnotic and henney
See now you're messing with pros
We can hide upstairs
That little bikini dispose (damn)
18 and under, thats held down by O
How we rock a jump off
Nobody has to know
Shhhhhhh

[Platinum status..TUG..B2k the whole family you
