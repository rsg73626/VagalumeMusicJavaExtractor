Omarion(verse1):
She walked through the doors of the club chillin' with her man
Lookin' sexy as hell with the jeans and a matching bag
The way she licked her lips made me wanna go and ask her name
The way she moved them hips
Kept staring at me
Let me know she wanted to play

Chorus:
Shorty is checkin' for me, (for me)
Shorty got her eyes up on me, (up on me)
We can get down with the quickness,
Just say the word and i'm with it(mami wanna roll)
Mami wanna roll with flava, (flava)
Take her from her man and save her, (woh)
Gurl just say the word and i'm wit it (you know)
And you definietly can get it.

Omarion(verse2):
She saw me out side about to leave mommy said "what up?"
(hey love, what's up?)(yeah, what's up?)
Me and my crew sittin' low in the hummer truck, (you know how

She steps to the driver side sayin' let's bounce, (lets go)
So i'm cool, let'sdo this be sure i'm out.(ohh)

Makebe"girl wonder" riddick:
Boy don't play games, (i don't play)
