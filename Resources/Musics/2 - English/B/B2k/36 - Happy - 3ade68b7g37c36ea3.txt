[Verse 1]
Listen
Last night
I was thinkin' bout back in the day
When you and I was so happy together every way
But now reminiscing
I can see the signs was right in front of my face
So I guess you was right the faults mine

[B Section]
Say you loved me (say you loved me)
Whatever
So completely
Whatever
I see you was wrong,but guess what? baby

[Chorus]
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip
didn't take long to get over you (guess what)
I'm good ain't got no attitude
Found another lover quick
finer than you
And that's the truth...fool
Im happy for you

[Verse 2]
Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me? (no)
You and me
We got a special thing
I can't let you go no (oh it's like that)
One more time girl you know I got you
You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything
Be the man you want me to be
Your everything
You know I love you

[B Section]
Girl I love you
(What ever)
Come on now girl
Lemme show you
(What ever)
I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face

[Chorus]
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip,didn't take long to get over you (guess what)
I'm good,ain't got no attitude
Found another lover quick,by loving you
And that's the truth...boy
Im happy for you

[Break]
Come on tell me how does it make you feel
To know I don't need,your love
I'm happy(man it's like dat?)
for ya
Come on tell me how does it make you feel
To know that he hot
You not
I'm happy for ya (I'm happy for you girl)
Im telling you

[Repeat Chorus to End]
