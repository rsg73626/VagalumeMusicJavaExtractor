GIRL POWER

[Chorus]
Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up. Never stay down
Girl power. Girl power
Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up cause you've come too far
Girl power
Girl power

Galleria]
I've made mistakes before
But I know I"m not perfect
It's okay cause who could ever be

[Chanel]
As long as I give my best
It won't matter what no one says
Cause deep down in my heart
I've got the power to make it all happen

[Chorus]

[Aqua]
At times I may just feel like
My back is to the wall
I hold my head up high

[Dorinda]
And keep standing tall

[Galleria]
I know that my back is covered

[Chanel]
Because we have each other
And we're down for whatever
If you hear me throw your hands up

[Chorus]

[Everyone]
Sometimes life may get you down
But you better hold your ground
Can't nobody live your life but you
Stay true to who you are
And don't waste all of your heart
Your heart
Your heart

[Chorus]
Throw you hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up
Cause you've come too far
Girl power
Girl power
