WHAT U GET

Ohhhh
Oh yea yea
Oh yea yea yea
Check it out

[VERSE 1 (Omarion)]
I know that you've been sayin
That things haven't turned out with him the way that you had always planned
I'm eager for the taking
It's time to be more than just friends

[Bridge]
I wanna be (your every hour man )
The one that you will always know
Will always need yea yea (your real love again)
To show you on the real who I be
Tell you if you just ask me

[CHORUS]
I'll tell you what you get is
All of me, fantasy, everything you need
Every chance I get
Shower you, how I do, just to prove to you
Tell you what you get
Just the truth, you can't lose, when I get to you
All the fairytale stories
That ya mama told you
Is what you get girl

[VERSE 2 (Omarion)]
Girl I don't mean to be pushy
But I know that you and me should be here livin out this fantasy
I love you but I'm fadin
I've been waitin here so patiently
I'm ready girl to be (your every hour man)
The one that you will always know
Will always need yea yea (your real love again)
To be there if you ask me
If you wanna be

[CHORUS]

I never thought I'd ever wanna be in on the lock, a one girl man
But you changed me and I, I
don't wanna spend my lifetime
Without you yea

[CHORUS (2x)]
