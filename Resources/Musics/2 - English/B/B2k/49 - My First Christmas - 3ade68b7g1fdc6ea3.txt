MY FIRST CHRISTMAS

Verse 1
My first christmas
Santa will be coming to my town
And it will be his first time
I wish for this day
Since i was just a little boy
And now it's here
And it feels so good to say
Merry christmas to all of you all
I wonder how it's gonna feel


Chorus(x)
To have my first christmas
My first christmas time
So beautiful
So special to me
All my family
Gifts under the tree
My first christmas time


Verse 2
Jingle bells will ring
The birds will sing
Of what a joy it will bring
Never thought i'd see the day
That sant a will bring christmas my way
But it's here
And it feels so good to say
Merry christmas to all of you, you, you, and you
I wonder how it's gonna feel


Chorus(x2)


Rap
There's so much for my family
I'm breaking my neck trying to get to the tree
Trying to see what my mom and dad got for me
The big body benz on 23s
Tv's in the back with the dvd's
What a special day for me
Mama in the house cookin' collards greens
Turkey with the ham and the mac 'n cheese


Chorus(x3)
