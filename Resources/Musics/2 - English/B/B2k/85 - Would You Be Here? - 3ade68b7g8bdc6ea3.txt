WOULD YOU BE HERE?

[Verse 1:]
Girl if I didn’t have a plan
Could I be your man still
And if you couldn't watch cable
Would you be able to understand
And if I couldn’t buy you diamond rings
Take you out and things
Or do nothing special 
Would you deal
Would stick around and chill
Would you keep it real
Tell me

[Chorus]
Would you be here if I had nothin
Would you be here if I was strugglin
If I had nothin
Would you be here at any cost
Would you be here if I didn’t have a boss
At any cost
Would you be here to pay the rent
Would you be here no benefits
Girl if that was it
Would you be here if I gave up
Straight outta luck
Would you give a what

[Verse 2:]
Girl if all hope was gone
We didn’t have a phone
Would you stay at home with me
How long would you stay by my side
If I applied
And wasn’t qualified, babe
What if I was finish
And you should do nuthin else with it
Would you forget it
Girl do you swear to tell the whole truth
Nothing but the truth
I’m listen baby

[Chorus:]
Would you be here if I had nothin
Would you be here if I was strugglin (if I was
stugglin)
If I had nothin (if I had nothin)
Would you be here at any cost
Would you be here if I didn’t have a boss
At any cost
Would you be here to pay the rent
Would you be here no benefits (no benefits)
Girl if that was it
Would you be here if I gave up
Straight outta luck
Would you give a what

[Hook 1:]
The day may come
When things ain’t going to good
So for my sake I gotta be sure
Who I’m choosing is all the way with it 
And outta line
I don’t want to get caught in sticky situations
Girl
You’ll never know you might not be so cold you might
get a little older

[Chorus 2x]
Would you be here if I had nothin
Would you be here if I was strugglin
If I had nothin
Would you be here at any cost
Would you be here if I didn’t have a boss
At any cost
Would you be here to pay the rent
Would you be here no benefits
Girl if that was it
Would you be here if I gave up
Straight outta luck
Would you give a what

[Hook 2:]
What if I was ugly
And struggling
And crummy
Would ya love me
If I was grungy
A little dingy
Would you still be with me
If I was ugly
And struggling
A little bummy
Would ya still love me
If I was crummy
And stuggly
Would you hug me

[Repeat Chorus]
