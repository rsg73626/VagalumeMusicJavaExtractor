RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER

Hey B2k
Can you guys tell met he story about Rudolph
The one with the shiny nose
Its red
They say it glows
Can you tell a story
Please, please, please

Rudolph the red-nose reindeer
Had a very shiny nose (like a rubie)
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows (like a light bulb; like some high beams)

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names (names)
They never let poor Rudlop 
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then all the reideer loved to him
And they shouted out with glee (yeah)
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer 
You'll go down in history

Wow that's a great story man
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history 
Hey

[Repeat again]
