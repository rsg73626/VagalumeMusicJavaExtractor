JINGLE BELLS

[chorus]
jingle bells,jingle bells
jingle all the way oh what fun it is to ride on a one-horse open sleigh
jingle bells,jingle bells jingle all the way oh what fun it is to ride on a
one-horse open sleigh

[verse 1]
dashing through the snow on a one-horse open sleigh over the hills we go
laughing all the way bells on bob-tails ring making spirits bright oh what fun
it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
[repeat chorus]

[verse 2]
now the ground is white go it while you're young take the girls along
and sing the sleighing song just get a bob-tailed bay two-forty as his speed
hitch him to an open sleigh and crack you'll take the lead
repeat chorus

[fizz's rap]
Rollin'down the street doing donuts in a clk while my homie's in the back
bumpin' ray-j cell phone's bought to ring we ain't answerin' no two-way we
aint tryna have no drama in this lovely christmas day
[repeat chorus until end]
