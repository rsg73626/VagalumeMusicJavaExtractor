[ Lil Fizz Rap 1:]
For the first 3 yrs
We was on coat fax
No deals no money
But everybody had our back
We know it would happen and thats for a fact
Until then we were just watching Cosby’s in the laundry mat
Scrounging up change for a pizza guy
No ride to Roscoe's
We made our own sunrise
Getting sick off cheetoes
Skittles and benekos
Marq yelling cause we eat his last taqeto
Wishing for a bank account with at least 2 zero’s
Playing ball all day
Sharing one Gatorade
No dogs of our own
So we walked Bear and Jane
Playing B-B bridges
Hopping over gates
Just to go swimming
Yeah we was bad
Tryna holla at all da women huh
Man
Times where hard
You know we didn’t get to much
But we always had each other man that was enough

[Chorus:](x2)
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
Werestill friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah dats a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
ya heard

[ Lil Fizz Rap 2:]
its getting hard now
what are we to do now
years are passing
its time to make moves now
We got our act together
faced the bad weather
told ourselves it was either now or never
so we grabbed our stuff and
started shopping at labels
perform demos and did whatever it takes
damn every label slammed the door in our face
but we kept our heads upuntil we found the right place

[Chorus:](x2)
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
Werestill friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah dats a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
ya heard

[Rap 3:]
We found a home now
It’s on 
We in the game now
Chris and Max done made this thing crack now
Now we work with Tommy and Polly with Dee Mack now
Took us a while but we got a name now
A platinum album with dough up in the bank now
No more lounging around, we businessmen now
Epic helped us and put us in the right gear
Video and radio thanks for the great year
I’m glad the time that it took was a struggle
so that when this time came we would be greatful and humble
We thank God for making all this happen for us
We thank all our fans for having love in us
c’mon

[Chorus:](x2)
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
Werestill friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah dats a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause weboys for life
ya heard

Thank God that you brought the joy to me
