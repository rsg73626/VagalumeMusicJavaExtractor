I BET

Girl, don't you tell me that you're dreamin that
And don't you tell me that you're scheming that
For thinking that he could ever take the place of me
And girl, don't you tell me that you've got my back
And don't you tell me that you don't see that
When it's a fact
That any dumb fool can see
How could you...

How could you think he's cool enough
To be the one to come in after me
I guess you've been writing comedy, now
How could you think he's good enough
To even compare to someone like me
If you don't know, you'll lose, you'll see, girl

[Hook]
I bet he won't no
I bet he won't keep you blingin like me, no
I bet he won't touch the places that I know
I bet he won't have the ends to keep you ridin the willie in a 4.6
Girl, no, no, no
I bet he won't keep you blingin like me, no, no
I bet he won't touch the places that I know
Unless you're losin your mind, or even goin blind
I bet he won't, I bet he won't, no, no

Girl, I know somebody must have hurt you bad
I know somebody must have made you crack
If you think that
He can do what I can do for you and
Girl, I know somebody must have told you to
I know somebody must've made you do the things you do
Cuz I know there's no way that you could be un true

How could you think he's cool enough
To be the one to come in after me
I guess you've been writing comedy, oh
How could you think he's good enough
To even compare to someone like me
If you don't know, you'll lose, you'll see, girl

[Repeat Hook]

You're livin in a dream if you think
That he can roll the dice and beat me
And if you're fool enough to take a chance
Then you will see
There's no other way but through me
It's locked up tight and I've got the key
So don't be wastin our time thinking that
It will never be

Baby, no, no...
Oh, no, oh-no, no, no, no
I bet he won't noooo...
Oh, no, no, bet he won't
I'm tellin you, I bet he won't...
