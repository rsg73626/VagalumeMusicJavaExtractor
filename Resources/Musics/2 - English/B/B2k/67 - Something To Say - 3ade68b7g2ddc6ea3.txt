SOMETHING TO SAY

(yeah)
(yeah yeah)
[2x] You see the girl by the water
Yes that one there
who I know 
that one day
one day she will care He comes from the Southside
He's got the sun in hair
He's got something that
The girls can't help it
Cant help but stop and stare
Yes I know that one day
He will see
I will jump all arround
Act like a clown
The world will know 
That he's in love with me [Chorus:]
She wants me
She needs me
She loves me
(But she doesnt know it yet)
She wants me 
(And I know what day)
She needs me
(He'll come my way
He'll come and take me home) (yeah)
(Come and take me home) Thats her house by the ocean
The summer breeze 
Took her there
I can see her walkin
As the boys keep talkin
One day I would stop and dare Well I know I'm what

He'll never be alone
The world with know 
That he's in love with me [Chorus 2x] (yeah)
