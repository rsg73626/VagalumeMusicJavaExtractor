WHY'D YOU LEAVE ME ON CHRISTMAS

[VERSE1]
See I bought you diamonds
And a brother stopped lyin'
I bought you Donna
Ralph Lauren and Prada
I know it majorly
Got a brother beggin'please
Got a brother on his knees
I bought you a two-way
I even left Shante'
I won't cheat again
I need you my friend
All a brother want for Christmas
Is to have you back right in my life

[Chorus (2x)]
Why'd you leave me
Why'd you leave me
On this Christmas
Why'd you have to go
Why'd you leave me
Why'd you leave me
On this Christmas
Why'd you have to go

[Verse 2]
See another man can't ever
Do what I would do for you
See I'm so confused
Got me stuck on you
My Momma say
Why do I deal with you 
Said I'm a crazy fool
And to stay away from you
I dissed my family
Just to get next to you
I bought your cell phone
Can't even talk to you
All a brother want for Christmas 
Is to have you right back in my life

[Chorus (2x)]

[J-BOOG'S TALK]
I mean why
Why'd you have to leave
Put the gifts under the tree
Dissed my family
I mean why
Baby i had the misletoe over the door waiting for you
Why'd you have to go
Please come back
I don't know what to do
If I had one wish for Christmas 
It would be to have you back in my life

[REPEAT CHORUS UNTIL FADE OUT]
