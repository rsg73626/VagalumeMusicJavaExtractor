WHAT A GIRL WANTS

[Omarion Talking]
Yo..I dont know whats goin on but I do know one thing..you gotta make it 
right..aight

[Omarion Verse 1]
Man whats goin on wit you
Why you treat her like ya do
When you know the girl is all about you..tell me
Why you always lose ya head
Should find a betta way to handle it
You need to stop this game befo you mess around and lose
(Im just tryna help you)
What A Girl Wants

[Chorus]
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
A guy to be there for her
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
Honesty, Love and a Friend

[Omarion Verse 2]
You always comin down on her
Why
Using all da foul words
Why
When you know that she'll do anything for you tell me
Why you always lie to her
And doin things she dont deserve
Man if you dont stop then she'll end up leaving you
(Im just tryin to help you..I know what)

[Chorus]
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
A guy to be there for her
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
Honesty, Love and a Friend

[Hook]
You dont know what ya got
Till its gone
And you left
All alone
And she'll be up and out the door
And I'll be right there to say I told you so
No more you had your chance
Take a hike
Shoulda been a man
Now she's gone
All because you were doin wrong
Shoulda listened to me

[Chorus]
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
A guy to be there for her
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
Honesty, Love and a Friend
