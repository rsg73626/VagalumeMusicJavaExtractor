EVERYONE'S HOME FOR CHRISTMAS

(feat. Batman)

[Verse 1]
Now that our family's here
Friends who are dear with us
It's time to trim the tree
We light the fire
It's Christmas Eve
Welcome to the table for some holiday fare
As we join our hands
In Christmas prayer

[Chorus]
I'm so glad the season is finally here
Our house is nice& full like it was last year
Nothing feels better than Christmas cheer
When everyone's home for Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
Outside snow fills the air
Colorful lights
Are seen everywhere
Sleigh bells
I heard through the night 
Little ones know 
Santa's coming tonight
Christmas trees
Carolers sing our favorite songs
So,let's grab our coats and sing along
Come on,come on,come on

[Chorus]

Christmas trees
Carolers sing our favorite songs
So,let's grab our coats and sing along
Come on

[Chorus 2x]

Yeah i'm by myself
It's getting late
Everyone's starting to leave
Man i wish Christmas would never end
