UNDERSTANDING

[Verse 1:]
I'm young, like to hang with my crew have fun
but it seems like all the girls I know, never understood that flow.
like this one, when i first met her she was so cool, but when i told her i need space, she got
all in my face.

[Hook:]
realizing what i need (the kind) of girl to be (for me) now i see its going to take some
understanding.

[Chorus:]
you want to be the one i'm looking for. the perfect one i need. you've got to be sexy and
secure and be understanding. cause i'm the kind of guy that likes to twerk no drama thats just
me. if you want to be the one i want then be understanding.

[Verse 2:]
now check it. one girl she had a little game (personality for days) insane the cutest little
hotty chic (she had the body in switch to go with it) but she had a problem with insecurity
(jelousy with me) but i'm not the one for drama though so i had to let her go. 

[Hook:]
realizing what i need. (the kind) of girl to be (for me) because i see its going to take so
understanding 
[Chorus:]
want to be the one i'm looking for the perfect one i need you've got to be sexy and secure and
be understandig cause i'm the kind of guy that likes to twerk no drama thats just me if you want
to be the one i want then be understanding

[Bridge:]
if you understand me then take my hand
and show me that you can be all i need then we can fall in love
[hold it for 3 seonds]

[Chorus 2x:]
want to be the one i'm looking for the perfect one i need you've got to be sexy and secure and
be understanding cause i'm the type of guy that likes to twerk no drama thats just me if you
want to be the one for me then be understanding.
