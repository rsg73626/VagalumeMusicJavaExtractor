ALONE

Alone
Na na na na na
Alone
Na na na na na
I know (listen up)

Questions cloud my head with why
Tears on my pillow as I cry
Makes no sense for us too say goodbye
Impossible to hide this pain inside
Thinking 'bout the times we shared
Makes me wonder if you even cared
Contemplating should I let you go
Girl why'd you leave me

(Chorus)
Alone
I been seating here waiting
By the phone
Give anything to hear 
Your tone
It was all my fault 
I know 
Now I just stand here 
Alone
Still remember the day when everything
Went wrong
Try to think how it would be if you hadn't
Gone
Away, shoulda made you stay
Now I just stand


Stormy nights and cloudy days
Can I fix it, what can I do, what can I say
Feels as if I'm stuck in a maze
With no way out I think I'm goin insane
So alone without you
Where'd you go I miss my baby boo
It's a shame cause I can't breath without you
Please come back girl
Cause I'm missing you


(Chorus)
Alone
I been seating here waiting
By the phone (by the phone)
Give anything to hear 
Your tone (yeah, ohh ohh)
It was all my fault
I know (I know...I kno, kno, kno)
Now I just stand here 
Alone
Still remember the day when everything
Went wrong
Try to think how it would be if you hadn't
Gone
Away, shoulda made you stay
Now I just stand

(Bridge)
Why, why, why
You leave out of my life
Need you right here by my side
Why, why, why
Why oh why

(Chorus 2x)
Alone
I been seating here waiting
By the phone (by the phone)
Give anything to hear 
Your tone (give anything)
It was all my fault
I know 
Now I just stand here 
Alone
Still remember the day when everything
Went wrong
Try to think how it would be if you hadn't
Gone
Away, shoulda made you stay
Now I just stand (stand)
