MY GIRL

Hey yo Trick
How you gone come up with another man
Yeah
This is what they are lookin for
Uh.........B2K
Uh.........Red zone
First verse

[Verse 1:]
She want it all
And I ain’t mad at that
She likes to floss
And watch my money stack
In and out the mall
Running into every store
She likes to ball
Can't help it she want more

[Hook:]
Always 
Something
She be wanting
Say she loves me
Know she frontin
My girl

[Chorus:]
She got a hold on me (my girl)
Like you ain’t never seen (my girl)
I give her what she wants 
She gives me what I need (my girl)
She always
Be in my pocket deep
I don’t care cause she is my girl
Cause I can’t let her go

[Verse 2:]
Can’t let her go
Her body’s callin me
Don’t care who knows
Cause she is apart of me
I’m so caught up
I know she is wrong for me
She is what I want
And dats enough for me

[Hook:]
Always 
Something
She be wanting
Say she loves me
Know she frontin

[Chorus:]
She got a hold on me (my girl)
Like you ain’t never seen (my girl)
I gave her what she wants 
She gives me what I need (my girl)
She is always
Be in my pocket deep
I don’t care cause she is my girl
Cause I can’t let her go

I can’t let her go [8x]

[Rap(Lil fizz):]

Hold it down
I'm 16
Holding it down
With Hova’ gun
Until I pass the crown
Yo back again
With this red zone sound
Pandemonium in every single town
What sold out shows unstoppable flows
The best of my day
Watch me do it my way
The youngest boys that will never be forgotten
And when it comes to blowing up 
Man it already happen
Got your hands up
Keeping your body rockin
The way Fizz is going
Ain’t no telling when I'm stoppin
A faced love
By every single kid
Its your neighbor bad boy me Lil’ Fizz

[Chorus:]
She got a hold on me (my girl)
Like you ain’t never seen (my girl)
I gave her what she wants 
She gives me what I need (my girl)
She is always
Be in my pocket deep
I don’t care cause she is my girl
Cause I can’t let her go
