DUNKA

[Fizz Spoken:]
Alright
I done been all around the world
And i noticed (what)
Baby's got dunka
Thats a good thing
In my case that is

[Verse 1 Fizz:]

Shes soft and sexy
With strawberry lip gloss
La Pearla thongs with the Ice Berry flip flops
The kind of girl that makes you drip drop cash
Hop out the rover, hop on some (shh)
Man this girl, she got me feeling so crazy
The way that dunka look, got me feeling so hazy
Asked can i grab
She said "You so crazy"
I give you my last name
She said
"Ok maybe"
I said "girlie girlie on the wall
With the biggest butt of them all"
There was a rubble double
5 minutes it lasted
She said come grab it you can see that (mmm)

[Chorus Marques:]

Look at shorty shakin that behind her
I'm bout to be right behind her
I'm just gon make this one mine- I
I think i'm sober
Cuz i'm so drunk and high now

She got
Baby got dunka
Baby got dunka

What she got
Baby got dunka

[Verse 2 Snoop:]

You gotta use what you got
Just to get what you want, yeah
You twirkin it and working it with a lot of pad
I see that you got a bright future behind you
I find you to be attractive
I'm back in action

You know what time it is

Really been hopin
Strokin, shaking
Shakin and strokin
Provokin, you

Hoping you, wanna do the same thing
Cuz you know the game gon' change

Yeah, probably will
Cuz I'll be so into you like SW

You in trouble again

[Verse 3 Fizz:]

So if you feelin freaky ma
Show me some dunka
I'm not Nick Cannon
So i'm not a fluke-a
Just give me a couple seconds
And i'm bringing it to ya
From the show to the telly
Do you like what i do to ya
So many moves you wanna call me karma sutra
If i was older we could spike the soda
But i'm not shorty ma, 
So lets get a little bolder
Take it all off, girl lets head to the sofa
