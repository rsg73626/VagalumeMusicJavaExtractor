FEVER (FEAT. ELISABETH TROY)

There is no even understanding what I'm feeling
Don't recognize myself just tell me what the deal is
Butterflying and I'm breezy
Losing my mind with the fever
Just need to know that you'll be there
(Be there, be there)
Losing my mind with the fever

You make me believe it
You make me believe it (leave it)

There is no even understanding what I'm feeling
Don't recognize myself just tell me what the deal is
Butterflying and I'm breezy (yes)
Losing my mind with the fever
Just need to know that you'll be there
(Be there, be there)
I'm losing my mind with the fever

You make me believe it (believe it)
You make me believe it (yeah)

Just need to know that you'll be there
(Be there, be there)
Losing my mind with the fever

You make me believe it (believe it)
