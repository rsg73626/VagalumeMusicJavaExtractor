NEVER GIVE UP

Im the kinda guy who will never give up,
I'd be dying at the bedside and I wouldn't give a fuck.
I'll keep fighting, stay strong,
Cos I will carry on.
People may doubt me but I don't care,
I'll stick that magnum up yo ass and I know you'll be scared.
I will always be a fighter, I will never stop.
I'll try and live on shot after shot.

People say that I'm stubborn,
Do ya think that I care?
Because I aint a quitter,
Do think that's fair?
I'll keep on pursuin' my dream,
If ya disagree I'll make ya scream.
My dream will never die,
Some day it'll be true.
As long as I never give up doing what I wanna do.

Im the kinda guy who will never give up,
I'd be dying at the bedside and I wouldn't give a fuck.
I'll keep fighting, stay strong,
Cos I will carry on.
People may doubt me but I don't care,
I'll stick that magnum up yo ass and I know you'll be scared.
I will always be a fighter, I will never stop.
I'll try and live on shot after shot.

I'll never give up, so don't nobody mess with me,
Im da under cover brotha can't you be impressed by me?
Don't you see, Im gonna be a winner?
Can't you see me as a rapper cos I aint a nigger?
My dream will stay alive,
My dream is immortal.
It will never die.
And some day my dream will come true.

Im the kinda guy who will never give up,
I'd be dying at the bedside and I wouldn't give a fuck.
I'll keep fighting, stay strong,
Cos I will carry on.
People may doubt me but I don't care,
I'll stick that magnum up yo ass and I know you'll be scared.
I will always be a fighter, I will never stop.
I'll try and live on shot after shot

I will stand I wont fall,
For I cant take another day against the wall.
And in my mind and in my soul
