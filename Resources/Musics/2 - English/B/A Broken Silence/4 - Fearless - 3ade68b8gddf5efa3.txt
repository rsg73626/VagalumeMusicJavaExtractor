FEARLESS

G’day world, how ya doing? you in a palace or house in ruin. we all struggle, no doubt we human but we grinding out solutions. inner peace can be illusive when following dreams so ruthless, but family be crucial, can see that I’ve been clueless. to the truest of epiphanies, that switching you to my centerpiece would come renew that energy, be mutual dependency. still love my boozed up memories, of cigar fumes and hennessey, I drafted  new   itinerary, a blueprint for future legacy.

So hold on, I’m steering, strength has come, I’m leading
A soldier, fearless, why scream no one can hear us
So hold on, I’m steering, strength has come, I’m leading
A soldier, fearless, why scream no one can hear us
So fearless, so fearless, so fearless, and all the fear is gone
So fearless, so fearless, so fearless, and all the fear is gone

Once based my days on chasing fame and chasing dames to make a name, my soul became a vacant place then over came a saving grace, after all the labor pain a heart could never stay the same, my path it did fade away, a starring role nature played, grasping on a razor blade to check that this is logical, pacing in that hospital, waiting on a doctors moves, I can take a knock or two, but to hold a tears impossible, done with fear, cut that loose, it's time to be a rock for you.

So hold on, I’m steering, strength has come and I’m leading
A soldier, fearless, why scream no one can hear us
So hold on, I’m steering, strength has come and I’m leading
A soldier, fearless, why scream no one can hear us

So fearless, so fearless, so fearless, and now the fear is gone
So fearless, so fearless, so fearless, and now the fear is gone

So hold on, I’m steering, strength has come and I’m leading
A soldier, fearless, why scream no one can hear us
So hold on, I’m steering, strength has come and I’m leading
A soldier, fearless, fearless
