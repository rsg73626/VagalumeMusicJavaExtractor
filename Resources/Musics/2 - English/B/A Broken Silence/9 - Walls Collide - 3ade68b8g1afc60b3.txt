WALLS COLLIDE

Some its how they brought up, some they got caught up
Some they been tortured their thoughts stayed dormant
Then they started morphing got hardly any caution
Seemed nutty talking, was buddy's now we awkward
Touched to many coffins, seen too many lost ones
Many like porcelain cracked in an instant

Poor to rich kids the off balance to the gifted
Mental states don't discriminate when they penetrate
Like a renegade that saw the fate of my many mates
On a steady chase inclined to celebrate on any day
Elevate, getting high I couldn't levitate, to see the state
Of their minds and had to get away. No one demonstrates
What to do in situations, in these cases
When they talking too outrageous
(Damn) so we soon became strangers
No one educates we knew none of the dangers

She never lets him see inside
[And he don't ever see the pain that's caught inside]
If she could see the world through his eyes
[And she don't ever see the pain that's caught inside]
We were so blind
[We don't ever see the pain that's caught inside]
They tried, we tried
[We don't ever see the pain]

Spent days trying to control that thought train
Cause to get to that happiness state we all aim
Trying to find nirvana some end like cobain
Some go bananas can't vent so pour blame
On your self, cause of wealth, cause of life
Cause you saw your relationship melt with your wife
Cause ya parents hit you with a belt in the eye
Cause ya doctor couldn't find the right pills to prescribe

Man this is life, this is everyday more of us
Rich or poor, internal war be borderless
Scientists been trying to get the core of this
Unlocked doors but be stuck in the corridors
Horrors of dealing with the unknown, think your alone
But don't know who followed you home, we silent though
About these issued as a whole so now we missing
Those that slipped in to there hold... cause

She never lets him see inside
[And he don't ever see the pain that's caught inside]
If she could see the world through his eyes
[And she don't ever see the pain that's caught inside]
We were so blind
Before some ever get to live, walls collide
And we don't ever see the game that's fought inside
Before some ever get to live walls collide
And we don't ever see the games that's fought inside
