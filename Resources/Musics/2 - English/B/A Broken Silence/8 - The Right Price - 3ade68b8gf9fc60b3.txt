THE RIGHT PRICE

Step on anyone on your mission to rise up, human brethren have been listening to liars, killing for wealth or religion is a virus, rebelling from wisdom that guides us
Bombs loaded, caught in the moment, no thought just war with opponents, pay that mortgage with my bonus, no thought of where your home is, gotta get my kids tuition, hope the missile hits with precision, to stop a terrorist ambition, them or us, quick decision. Hurry up, pick your mission

We fall for anything, everything has a right price
For better results you need to evolve to move me
Destroy enemies, burry them till my minds right
It's taken it's toll, your way to involved to see that you fall too easy
We fall for anything, everything has the right price
Yeah you fall so easy

Bombs loaded strapped to my vest now, so hopeless mad at the west now, been told a bomb is my best route, explode and God he will bless thou. My lands under occupation and we're branded abominations, circled by a domination, God damn I've lost my patience. I'm blowing up a station, paradise my consolation

We fall for anything, everything has a right price
For better results you need to evolve to move me
Destroy enemies, burry them till my minds right
It's taken it's toll, your way to involved to see that you fall too easy
We fall for anything, everything has the right price
Yeah you fall so easy
