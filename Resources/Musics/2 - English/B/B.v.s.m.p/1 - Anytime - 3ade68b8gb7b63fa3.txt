ANYTIME

Ooh
ooh
Baby
I have made a promise and I do my best to keep it
'Cause you kept your promise and you never asked for profit
I want to repay you
Baby
And be there for you
too so
Any time you want me
Any time you need me
Anytime
Just call on me
Any time you miss me
Any time you're lonely
Call on me and I'll be there
Yes I'll be there
I'll do my best and nothing less
So come on
Baby
Make your request
I'm here for you as you are for me
Just say the world 'love' and 
Let it be
Remembering walking very slowly in the rainy weather
You and I hand in hand
Perfectly together
Love was created when the words were spoken
And I made you a promise that won't be broken
Any time you want me
Any time you need me

You don't need to have a reason
Any time of day
Any time of season
Any time you want me
Any time you need me

I'll do my best and nothing less
So come on
Baby
Make your request

Any time you want me
Anytime you need me

Any time you want me
Anytime you need me
