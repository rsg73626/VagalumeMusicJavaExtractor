BE GENTLE

Be gentle when you want me
When you need me show me you love me
Be gentle like the breeze on a summer's night
Whenever I'm with you everything is alright

Underneath the stars as we strall
With the aid of moonlight a silhouette I behold
Using that special feeling to guide my eyes
Once locked in place I realize
That the shadow that is formed is one not two
And that's the way it should be while it's me and you

Standing side by side with the stars above
Could this mean that I'm falling in love?
The feeling is there and there's no mistaking
With just one touch you've got me shaking
Something seems strange
I don't know what it is
It must have started out with the first kiss
Ever since then things just weren't the same
One hundred times a day I called out your name

Be gentle when you want me
When you need me show me you love me
Be gentle when you want me
When you need me show me you love me
Though we never got further than a simple embrace
Every time I close my eyes I see her face

To tell the truth I don't know what to do
How do I know if the girl is true blue?
I went further than I wanted
Now it can't be stopped
Girl, the feeling that you give me can't be topped
See, love is based on many different levels
But the love you give is all so gentle
One thing is for sure
My love is pure
'Cause you're the one I want
The one I adore

The one pleasure that I treasure is to call you mine
'Cause you spoil me with your love that is so devine.
My emotions are strong and I'm here to show
That I'm not a one-night Romeo
Each of us only has one life to live
So girl
Stop taking and start to give

I'm desperately waiting for you to share
My life of tender love and care
Sometimes I can't help it if I'm sentimental
'Cause your touch is soft and your love's so gentle
Be gentle when you want me
When you you need me showme you love me

I'm trying to take things slow
One step at a time
Because falling in love is like committing a crime
And I can only plead guilty if my love is true
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
You get to me, girl
Like many others have tried

And you're the only female that keeps me satisfied
If your love can be mine just for one day
I would hope that you would happen to come my way
And as the day begins
A frown is on my face
But it comes to an end with your warm embrace
Sometimes I can't help it if I'm sentimental
'Cause your touch is soft and your love's so gentle
Be gentle when you want me
When you need me show me you love me
