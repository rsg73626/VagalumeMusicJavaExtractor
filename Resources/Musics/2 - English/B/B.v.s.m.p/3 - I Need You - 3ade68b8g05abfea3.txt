I NEED YOU

Yo'

I love you
baby
oh
I want to sing a song
girl

I need you
sha-na-na-na-na-na
you're what I want

Oh
girl
I need you
sha-na-na-na-na-na

You're what I want
yo'
hey
check this out!

What's it gonna take to get your attention?
You're keeping my mind hanging in suspension.
I want you
that's what I'm trying to say

But for your love night and day I pray.
Where have you been all of my life?
You are a perfect girlfriend and I want you for my wife.
I'm after your heart
oh

don't you see I'm not out to get your virginity?
And I understand why you are playing hard to get

But for you
girl
I have all due respect!
So don't reject
may I correct

let me be the one that you select.

I need you
sha-na-na-na-na-na
you're what I want
oh
girl

I need you
sha-na-na-na-na-na
you're what I want
oh
girl

I want you
you're what I need

oh
baby
yo'
babe
check this out!

I never wanted nothing like I want you

I don't ask for much and you know that's true.
I'm just telling you straight and I'm trying to be polite

When I met you it was love at first sight.
I feel like I'm filling out an application

So read my resum and have no hesitation.
Every time I see a girl I fall in love again

Wish that we could be more than just friends.
And I'll be there whenever you take a fall

And will live happily ever after a wall.

No fussing or fighting we sing a song

if you were to cry how we belong.
'Cause you're my girl and you shine like gold

You are hard to get and will be hard to hold.
I think about you from dusk till dawn

And the sound of your voice helps me carry on.
And that look in your eyes that makes me weep

You are a quiet female
you hardly ever speak.
We may not be good at real romance

But I can do my best if I can get my chance.

I need you
sha-na-na-na-na-na

you're what I want
oh
girl
. . .

Give me a chance to show and prove

you baby doll
don't front the move.
I'm not like the other guys
I'm different

Like you
you know I'm the innocent.

I shouldn't tell you this
but I keep urging

You might not believe it
but I'm still a virgin.
Do you want my love? I need to know

we're taking this situation too slow.

Say yes
and I keep a smile on your face

But it you say no
you're gone without a trace.
'Cause you are the one and you got my number

I dream about you when I'm deep in slumber.
And you know that it's your love I need

and satisfaction is guaranteed.
And you know I want your love so much

And I'm singing this song with a M.C. touch.

I need you
you're what I want
I need you

and I gotta have you
baby

You're what I want
I want you
you're what I need
oh
baby

You were sent from heaven above
sweet and soft as a dove

You're what I want
oh
girl
I need you

I love you
I love you
I love you.
