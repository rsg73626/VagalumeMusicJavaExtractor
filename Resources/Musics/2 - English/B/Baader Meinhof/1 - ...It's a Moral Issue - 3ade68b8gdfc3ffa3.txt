...IT'S A MORAL ISSUE

Oh Keith you do my head in
But I'm glad you're around
'cos it's a moral issue
And you're on higher ground
Some might say you're a parasite
Doing business for the state
My american friend
Went and made you cry
- now he's passed away
Oh jackie girl, jackie girl

Gary is a witness
But I'll swear he's made of sand
They put him in a time machine
Told him where to land

Someone had a bright idea
But it did not adhere
Colindale is now a police college
I was born 20 miles from there....
