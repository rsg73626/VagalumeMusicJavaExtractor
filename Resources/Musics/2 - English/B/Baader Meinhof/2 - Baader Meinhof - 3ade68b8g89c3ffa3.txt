BAADER MEINHOF

We made the cops look dumb
On the border line
Springer said 'must be the mood of the times'
Rudi says "we've got to get wise"
And we've got to get armed'
Its a surveillance state operation
Rich kid with a gun

Al-fatah in palestine against the p.l.o.
Andreas says 'she's not the girl that I used to know
Rudi says.......

Child of eva - your christianity
I had a dream it was the end of the seventies'
