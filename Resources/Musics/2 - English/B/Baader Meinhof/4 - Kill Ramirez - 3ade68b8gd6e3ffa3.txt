KILL RAMIREZ

Well we hate him
We despise him
We will make him kiss the ground
Down at our feet
'cos he's acting like a tourist
Kill ramirez el pirata cofrisi

Ramirez walking and he's talking
He's got the secret to my life
In his right hand
Come on fat boy
Where you hiding
Kill ramirez el pirata he's my man
Kill ramirez el pirata

Patrick arguello, leila khaled
Dissappeared into the tail end of the plane
Said he's not one
Of the brothers
Good days bad days
They're all the same
Kill ramirez el pirata
