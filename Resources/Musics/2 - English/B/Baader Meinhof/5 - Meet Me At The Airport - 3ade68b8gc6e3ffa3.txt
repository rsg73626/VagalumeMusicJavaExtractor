MEET ME AT THE AIRPORT

I met a man
He was a trader
And he did a cargo at 10,000 over jordan
It's not for gods love
It's not for cocaine
When you've decided -
Meet me at the airport
So we talk for hours
And we talk religiously
And he said "could I take out every woman and child in the border town"
For the right to be governed -
Waste them without mercy
When you've decided -
Meet me at the airport
Do it for god -
Do it for allah
And put your faith in captain muhmad and al-fatah
I met a man (I met a man)
He was a prophet (and he was a prophet)
When you've decided -
Meet me at the airport
When you've decided -
Meet me at the airport
