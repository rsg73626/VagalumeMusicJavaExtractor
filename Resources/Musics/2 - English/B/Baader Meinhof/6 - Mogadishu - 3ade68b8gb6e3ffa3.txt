MOGADISHU

I had to cut a deal
With some popstars in the night
I'm down as an extermist
He's a parasite
Drive me to the city limits
God is war and love
Your lucky star fell out the sky
And the mother ship's above
Capatin martyr mahmoud says
It's a 24 hour flight
When the fireworks hit you
Mogadishu
On a beautiful saturday night
Yeah, all right
Ooh-ooh
Your captain is a cypher
An informant from dubai
Each traitor gets four cigarettes
And makes his will to die
Capatin martyr mahmoud said
It's a 24 hour flight
When the fireworks hit you
Mogadishu
On a beautiful saturday night
Ooh
Christ was an extremist
With kamikaze soul
Happy birthday anna
You're 29 years old
And I've got to find a superstars
And I've got to find the girls
To take me to the city limits
To the mother ship below
Capatin martyr mahmoud said
It's a 24 hour flight
When the fireworks hit you
Mogadishu
On a beautiful saturday night
Capatin martyr mahmoud says
It's a 24 hour flight
When the fireworks hit you
Mogadishu
On a beautiful saturday night
All right
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
