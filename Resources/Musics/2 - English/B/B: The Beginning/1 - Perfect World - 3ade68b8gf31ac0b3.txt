PERFECT WORLD

Someday I'll be gone
To somewhere that we belong
And God has never played his role
Cause I'm the one who saves my soul
It's a perfect world we're longing for
So long

Cursed shadows haunt and gather
In the city of no answer
As we follow endless questions
Hands up in the same reflection

Sometimes we try to feel how things just used to be in yesterdays
No on ever make it better, no one ever lives forever
Wake me up and let me go

Someday I'll be gone
To somewhere we all belong
For so long

Broken people, broken feelings
Feeling numb but know they're bleeding
Light and darkness bond together
Faith will save u (yeah, whatever)

Sometimes we try to feel how things just used to be in yesterday
But never seem to be believe in what we see today
No on ever make it better, no one ever lives forever
Wake me up and let me go!

Someday I'll be gone
To somewhere we all belong
And God has never played his role
And I'm the one who saves my soul
It's a perfect world we're longing for
Won't you

Show me the light? How far will you go?
For a vengeance in this wasted world that we know
To sleep in silence
We need to laugh again

Someday I'll be gone (someday I'll be)
To somewhere we all belong

Yeah

Someday we'll be gone (someday we'll be)
To somewhere we all belong
And God has never played his role
Cause I'm the one who saves my soul
The perfect world we're longing for

So long
