EVERLASTING PICTURES

Everlasting pictures from here,
right through infinity.

All my words are wrapped inside,
so they won't escape.
What removed the colours
stays for another day.
Can't say nothing,
but I don't wanna render
- no no no -
the way I dream.

Words won't come easy,
when you kiss the sky.
I feel it in my heart,
I feel it in my head,
but no reply.
Can't say nothing,
but I don't wanna render
- no no no -
the way I see.
