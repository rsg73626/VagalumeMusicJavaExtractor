AN AWAKENING OF REVENANTS

All
kneel down
in frantic prayer
the sudden stench of sulfur consumes the
air
waves of
scarlet
the cursed
harlot evil plants it's seed in-
side of
her womb
an archean system shifts toward apocalypse
a leader betrayed by
false armistice
ashen
faces
appear
when the ascension circles near the
sapien assembly line
stops!
awaken malicious race
perishing the seven
gates
acts of devilry
birthing hatred in symmetry
the lamias sing to the
hymn of suffering
deceased mark a trail
beheaded and impaled
our brethren
fall deep in frost
a demonic holocaust
the reproductive tragedy plays it's
role
hybrids born of condemned souls
when the incantations were uttered
an
act of lust gifts the world to
suffer! beyond! what one! can endure!
a new!
age of! war has! rid the pure!
