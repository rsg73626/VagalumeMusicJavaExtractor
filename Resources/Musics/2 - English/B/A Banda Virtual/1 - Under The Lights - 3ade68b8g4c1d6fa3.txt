UNDER THE LIGHTS

Somehow you're grieving 
Sensation is the anger is growing
Under the lights you're going down but now 
You're right on your own
Is it impossible to feel like
You have been out so long?

Is that so easy 
If you make a life so wild and alone

I have been crawling,
been looking for someone who will feed me
If you can show me anyway that I can go, please.


And every time you see 
the broken mirror you'll feel
Vengeance and fear both sided hand in hand
You're a trio.
