THAT'S HOW I KNOW

My friends ask me
When it comes to giving you my heart
How can I be sure?
'Cause they see how fast we
Filled up all the empty parts
In my soul and yours

When I answer it erases their doubts
'Cause the truth comes out

When I'm miles away
And I still feel your touch
When I make mistakes
And no one gives up
When you're in my arms
Baby you're still not close enough
That's how I know it's love
It's love

Just like they are
I'm amazed I found someone made just for me
Oooo your love so far
Tell me I would be a fool not to believe
That I've been given a gift in this life
I must have done something right

When I'm miles away
And I still feel your touch
When I make mistakes
And no one gives up
When you're in my arms
Baby you're still not close enough
That's how I know it's love

Now I now what forever's for
Each day I want you more

When I'm miles away
And I still feel your touch
When I make mistakes
And no one gives up
When you're in my arms
Baby you're still not close enough
That's how I know it's love

That's how I know it's love
