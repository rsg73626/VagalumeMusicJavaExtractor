HOW DID WE END UP HERE

I let you go, you did just the same
We must have thought that we'd be
Better off that way
Now here we are, free to move on
Searching just to find the love
We both had all along

After all the words were said now
I'm thinking we should just be friends

How did we end up here?
Didn't we say goodbye?
I guess it took breaking up
To make us realize
How did we end up here?
I thought we couldn't work it out?
It seems the circle of love
Brought us back around

We acted strong
We thought we tried our best
To save what we had,
By giving up on all the rest
It all just seems so clear
At least at the time
Convincing ourselves
We were just doing what was right

After all those talks together
Thought we gave up on forever

How did we end up here?
Didn't we say goodbye?
I guess it took breaking up
To make us realize
How did we end up here?
I thought we couldn't work it out?
It seems the circle of love
Brought us back around

Sometimes the truest lies
Are the ones we tell ourselves
The very last time, we said goodbye
Inside we meant don't go

How did we end up here?
Didn't we say goodbye?
I guess it took breaking up
To make us realize
How did we end up here?
I thought we couldn't work it out?
It seems the circle of love
Brought us back around

How did we end up
How did we end up here?
How did we end up
Right back where we started
How did we end up
How did we end up here?
How did we end up
Right back where we started
