GO GO

Here I am (it's)
It's Friday night (Ah...)
Feelin' good (good...)
The time is right
There you come (right...)
Out of the crowd
And all that I can say is

Chorus
I want you to know
That I can rock you girl
So come on let's go
I want you to see
I'm really feelin' you
So if you're feelin' me
I want you to know
That I can rock you baby
With the lights down low
I want you to see
I'm really feelin' you
So if you're feelin' me
Go Go

So you think you got it all together
Before you make a move and get too deep
Don't you know that I can love her better?
So give it up, go home
And get some sleep

Chorus

I must have been mistaken for another (here I am...)
You overlooked the fact that I'm your older brother  ( Friday night...)
Don't you know the girl
She wants me (Out of the crowd...)
So look in the other direction
And go and get some (go, go, go...)

Chorus
