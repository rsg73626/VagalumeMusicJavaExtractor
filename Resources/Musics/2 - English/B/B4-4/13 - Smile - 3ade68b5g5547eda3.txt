SMILE

Oh baby
Ain't it like you to make me smile
Pick me up when I'm feelin' down
When no one else comes around
Ain't it like you to make me smile

Oh baby
Ain't it like you to make me cry
Every mile brings another tear
Just wishin' you were here
Ain't it like you to make me cry

How many times have I
Hung on the line, waitin'
For you to say the words
To let me know that you're
Needing me so...

How many times have I
Hung on the line, waitin'
For you to say the words
To let me know that you're
Needing me so...

Oh baby
Ain't it like you to make me smile
Though I may not tell you enough
When it all gets too much
Ain't it like you to make me
Ain't it like you to make me
Ain't it like you to make me...smile
Smile

You make me smile
You make me smile
You make me smile

You make me smile
You make me smile
You make me cry

(repeat until fade)
