SAVIN' FOR A RAINY DAY

Don't hold back
The way you really feel
What you don't say
You know your eyes reveal
I'm knockin' at your door
So open up your heart
You know I'm what you really want
So what you waitin' for?

Keepin' it all inside
When it should be you and I
What's the point of keepin' it to yourself?

If you're savin' for a rainy day
Then let me be the rain
If you're lookin' for a love that's true
Then baby look my way
If you're hopin' for a miracle
Then I can be your wish
If you're savin' for a rainy day
Then baby here it is

But there you are
Standin' by yourself
Too shy to ask
But you know I can tell
That what you really, really,
really, really need
Is what I really got to give
But baby you will never know
Until you let me hear

Keepin' it all inside
When it should be you and I
What's the point of keepin' it to yourself?

If you're savin' for a rainy day
Then let me be the rain
If you're lookin' for a love that's true
Then baby look my way
If you're hopin' for a miracle
Then I can be your wish
If you're savin' for a rainy day
Then baby here it is

So close to paradise
It's right outside your door
Close enough for you to touch
I'm everything that you've been waiting for

If you're savin' for a rainy day
Then let me be the rain
If you're lookin' for a love that's true
Then baby look my way
If you're hopin' for a miracle
Then I can be your wish
If you're savin' for a rainy day
Then baby here it is

If you're savin' for a rainy day
If you're savin' for a rainy day
If you're savin' for a rainy day
(repeat until fade)
