REALLY GOTTA WANT IT

The world is full of wannabe’s
They come and go like a
Summer breeze
They want the money
They want the fame
But you know you gotta earn it
Each and every day

If you can conceive it
Then you can achieve it
No one’s goona give it to you
Go and get it!

You really gotta want it
you just gotta have it
You gotta be committed
You gotta live and breathe it
You really gotta mean it
Never be defeated
If you wanna reach your dream
Ain’t no room for in-between

They say stop, you say go
You say yes, they say no
When they laugh, make fun of you
You just work harder
You’ve got things to prove

If you can believe it
Then receive it
Don’t let nobody stand in your way
The first at practice, the last to leave
When others doubt,
That’s when you believe
It’s gonna take blood, sweat and tears
Before you’re gonna hear the crowd cheer

You really gotta want it
you just gotta have it
You gotta be committed
You gotta live and breathe it
You really gotta want it
you just gotta have it
You gotta be committed
You gotta live and breathe it
No.no
You really gotta mean it
Never be defeated
If you wanna reach your dream
Ain’t no room for in-between
Oh no, no
You really gotta want it
