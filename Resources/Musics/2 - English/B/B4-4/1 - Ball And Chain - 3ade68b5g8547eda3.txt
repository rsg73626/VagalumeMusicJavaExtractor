BALL AND CHAIN

Chorus :
I just wanna be your ball and chain
Wrapped around your finger
Locked up, tied me down
Follow you forever
Never let you get away,
Holding on like a ball and chain

I never wanted to stay
In one place too long
Oh no, not me, I didn't wanna be
A victim of that fatal touch
When you want someone too much but
You, you'll be the end of me

And I don't want to hurt anymore

Chorus -repeat-

I tried my best to avoid
Making promises
Oh, no, not me, I didn't wanna
Be a prisoner of that tender trap
When there's no turning back but
You, you got me on my knees

And I won't be afraid anymore

Chorus -repeat-

(rap)
I know it's been some time confined to be alone
but I know I found the one who's gots be this loves jones
you know that I get open when you rubbing my back the goose bumps
and chills must be proof of that
â€˜cause I'm feeling when your dealing all the knowledge
you've got about making it good when you touching my spots

I won't be afraid anymore

The side of you be wanting me just haunting
my fight boy be my ball and chain yo it's gotta be right

Chorus -repeat-
