GET DOWN

I will be the one to love and comfort you
From now until the day I die
I will take you places that you only think
About when you're asleep at night
Let me take the time to understand
And I will set your spirit free

Chorus
If you get down on me
I'll get down on you
I will do anything
That you want me to
It's a game of give and take
To make it though
So if you get down on me
I'll get down on you tonight

Nighttime turns to day again
And you were on my mind
Winter turns to spring and then
Life has passed you by
Right now we are so young and free
But we're running out of time
So while we got each other here
Let's treat our bodies right

I wanna know exactly what to do
So that you'll never get me off of you mind
Communicate andI'll go undercover
Gonna make you come tonight
Over to my house

Chorus

I'm not the type to change your mind
If you wanna take it slow
No pressure to go all the way
There's other places we can go

Anytime is the right time to reveal it
when two people fall as deep as you and me
(So tell me what you're thinkin')
I wanna know every inch of your body
So I can set your spirt free

Chorus

I will be the one to love and comfort you
From now until the day I die
I will take you places that you only think
About when you're asleep at night
If you open up to me
I'll make you realize
The things that you could never see
Let me take the time to understand
And I will set your spirit free

Chorus
