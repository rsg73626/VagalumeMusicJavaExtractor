EVERYDAY

Now that you're right in front of me
There's something that I would
like to say to you
I made up my mind
And If you feel the same
I swear that I will be there
everyday

Everyday from now
until I die, I will spend my life with you
I can only pray
That we'll stay the same
Everyday

Open your eyes and look at me
Tell me that you can't see it too
'Cause I'll be complete
If you take this ring
I swear that I will love you everyday

We both know this world
Is always changin'
No one stayin' together
But  maybe God will let us
Last forever and ever

If I swear that I will be there everyday
And I swear that I will love you everyday
I swear that I will love you everyday
