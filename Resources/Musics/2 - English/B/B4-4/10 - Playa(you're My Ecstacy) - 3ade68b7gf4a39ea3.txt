PLAYA(YOU'RE MY ECSTACY)

Na na na na nah nah 
Na na na na nah nah (you're my Ecstasy)

Oh yeh yeh yeh yeh oh oh ohh

Verse One (Dan)
Girl there's nothing I'd rather do
Then be breaking this bed with you
Alright, I just want to make you sweat
Get you all soaking wet
Better know what now comes next
Alright, the way you playing me baby makes me crazy

Pre Chorus ( Ryan)
Ooo I'm never going to stop the game we play
Do you feel the same?

Chorus (Ryan,Dan and Ohad)
You should know that I'm a player
But it's real the way I feel you
Take my hand, I'm sure you'll love it
Lay right here in this bed of roses
Scream that word to get me stronger
I can't hold this any longer
Finally I think I've found ya
Cause you're my Ecstasy

Verse Two (Dan)
Girl I feel we're like a game
Cause nothing ever feels the same 
When I'm spending my nights in bed with someone new
I never really had a clue
How I always run back to you, alright!
The way you're playing me baby makes me crazy

Pre Chorus ( Ryan)
Ooo I'm never going to stop the game we play
Do you feel the same?

Chorus (Ryan,Dan and Ohad)
You should know that I'm a player
But it's real the way I feel you
Take my hand, I'm sure you'll love it
Lay right here in this bed of roses
Scream that word to get me stronger
I can't hold this any longer
Finally I think I've found ya
Cause you're my Ecstasy

Oh yeh yeh yeh yeh oh oh oh (you're my Ecstasy)
Oh yeh yeh yeh yeh oh oh oh
Na na na na nah nah 
Na na na na nah nah (you're my Ecstasy)

Bridge (Ohad,Dan and Ryan)
Oh girl, girl, girl, I don't need to say no more
