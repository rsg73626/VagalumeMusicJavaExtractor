DON'T LET THE SUN CATCH YOU CRYING

Don't let the sun catch you crying
The night's the time for all your tears
Your heart may be broken tonight
But tomorrow in the morning light
Don't let the sun catch you crying

The nighttime shadows disappear
And with that go all your tears, baby
For the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy
Don't don't don't don't let the sun catch you crying
Oooo baby

You know that crying's not a bad thing
But stop your crying when the birds sing
Oh no no no

Oh yeah
Oooo oooo

Just don't forget that love's just a game
And it can always come again
So don't let the sun catch you crying
Don't let the sun catch you crying, baby

Tomorrow in the morning light
Everything gonna be all right
Tomorrow in the morning light
Everything gonna be all right
Tomorrow in the morning light
Everything gonna be all right
(repeat until fade)
