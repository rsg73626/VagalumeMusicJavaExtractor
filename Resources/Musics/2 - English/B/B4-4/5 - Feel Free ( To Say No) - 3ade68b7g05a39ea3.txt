FEEL FREE ( TO SAY NO)

Feel free to
Say no now
Everybody get up and shout it out
Feel free to
Say no now
Dont you give a damn about your life now?

Verse One

Dan

Friday night about ten oclock
In the back seat getting hot
Couldnt wait to get you in bed
Pulled it out and you went ahead

Ryan

I said stop wait what is that
Steaming up in my Cadillac
Couldnt see and i couldnt breathe
Youre about to kill it lady

Grow up start to use your brain or find another man

To finding out what u love the most

Before we lose everything we got
Lot of things you can stimulate
But you`re about to kill it lady

Pre-Chorus

Ohad

Girl you know that Im the only one that gives a damn
Grow up start to use your brain or find another man
