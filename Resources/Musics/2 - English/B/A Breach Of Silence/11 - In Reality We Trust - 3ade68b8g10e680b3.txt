IN REALITY WE TRUST

Put the gun to your head
Feel the pressure taste the lead
Open your eyes and you will see
Not everything is your reality

Put the gun to your head
Feel the pressure taste the lead
Open your eyes and you will see
Not everything is your reality

Look to the sky
Stare into the light
And tell me what you believe in now
You can't trust everything
That you've been told

There is no savior
Give me something to believe in
I feel like I am lost at sea
Save me from this fucking ocean
I need to find what's left in me

Follow me
Follow me
Now my back is up against the wall
So tell me what the fuck do you stand for?

Put the gun to your head
Feel the pressure taste the lead
Open your eyes and you will see
Not everything is your reality

I've given up on faith
And falling to my knees
Falling to my knees
Yeah! Give me a reason to carry on
When all hope is gone
Look at what you've done

You were so lost
Look at what you've done
All hope is gone
Look at what you've done
You were so lost, all hope is gone

Look to the sky
Stare into the light
And tell me what you believe in now
You can't trust everything
That you've been told

There is no savior
Follow me
Follow me
Now my back is up against the wall
So tell me what the fuck do you stand for?

Put the gun to your head
Feel the pressure taste the lead
Open your eyes and you will see
Not everything is your reality

Put the gun to your head
Feel the pressure taste the lead
Open your eyes and you will see
Not everything is your reality
