BLIND

No more end of time
There is something in me
Feel the pressure in your mind, tear apart
Tears apart my life

This is my final chance to seize it all
Everything in this war
Behind the veil (of opportunity)
Visions lost in (within the sympathy)
The dark takes hold of me, this is my destiny

There's nothing to believe in
Torture everyone, my enemies
Consumed in darkness, eternity
Behind the veil (of opportunity)
Visions lost in (within the sympathy)
The dark takes hold of me, this is my destiny

There's nothing to believe in
I repent
I repent in this war
I resent
I resent every word
Oh, everything I touch it turns to stone
Everything I touch it turns to stone
Tear apart my life and put it back

Everything and nothing at
Everything I touch
You will never know
Everything I know
You will never touch
Because everything I touch it turns too stone

Behind the veil (of opportunity)
Visions lost in (within the sympathy)
I repent every single word
You can't see you're blinded from the end
