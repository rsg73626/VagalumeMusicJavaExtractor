A PLACE I KNOW

You'd burn this city to the ground
You've lost your heart
You've lost your mind

Falling by the wayside with no regrets
You're just a slave to the sorrow
For all this time you've been so lost
So tonight you will shine like diamonds in the sky

Time still remains
These broken words can't save the day
Fate to be explained
A tortured soul as daylight fades

Don't you give up on me now
I've never let you go and I never will
Don't you give up on me now
I've never let you go and I never will

I never thought that you could sink so low
Now I can see the light that you see
'Til the end, 'til the death
This is forever
Upon the tides you will scream
'Til the end, 'til the death
This is forever

Time still remains
These broken words can't save the day
Fate to be explained
A tortured soul as daylight fades

Let's go to a place I know
Where the familiar sting allows me to let go
If I could take it all back
I would give it all away
The clothes on my back
The tears of yesterday

I sit and watch you're world go by
Darkness my friend
You're my light while I'm high
Can I still feel?
Can I hurt?
I'm ready to leave
I'll turn dust to dirt
