NIGHT RIDER

My life is for the taking now the gun is in my hand
One gun, one round, one life is for the taking
One pull, one shot, one showdown brings the end
Through every night don't you turn around?

And bleed forever nothing left no regret in
No regret in my life
Tear in my eyes
It's a good day to die

Now as I step outside
The end descends upon me
Through every war
Don't you turn around, is me

Forever haunted for eternity with my lonely soul
Tear in my eyes
It's a good day to die
Now as I step outside, the end descends upon me

Night rider, the outlaw of the west
He will come to take you all too hell
Night rider, the outlaw of the west
He will come to take you all to hell

Outlaw, cannot take my life
Outlaw, never take my life
What I am - an outlaw until the end
Dead or alive, an immortal I am in your eyes
