LOST AT SEA

Wake up, you are the reason
We sail into the lights
Wake up, this ship is sinking
We won't make it out alive

Close your eyes, pretend it's a dream
The sea is ours. It's where we roam
We sail with you until the end
Until the end

We're going under now so rapidly
Losing sight of the sun
Upon this ship we are sinking
We're sinking deep into the seas of our existence

We sail with you until the end
Until the end
We're going under now so rapidly
Losing sight of the sun
We're going under now so rapidly
Losing sight of the sun

Not a day goes by I don't think of this
I don't dream of this
I promise to you and you can believe me
Through all of our games and all our mistakes
You were my everything

So promise to me that you will be waiting
Although I'm gone
I have not forgot
Just be strong
You are my everything

Wake up you are the reason
We sail into the lights
Wake up this ship is sinking
We won't make it out alive
