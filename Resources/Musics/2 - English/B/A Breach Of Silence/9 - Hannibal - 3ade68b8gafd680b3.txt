HANNIBAL

The walls are falling in on me
Through the eyes of a wolf I will see
My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be
The walls are falling in on me
Through the eyes of a wolf I will see
My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be

The walls are falling in on me
Fragments of what I used to be
Aspirations to reclaim
All I've been before
And what I will be again
And what I will be again

The walls are falling in on me
Through the eyes of a wolf I will see
My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be
To rise so quickly out of haste
Will lead to destruction of your fate
You'll see your enemies ascend
As your intentions come to an end

Reclaiming
Reclaiming all that I was before
Replacing
Replacing the broken with the strength to carry on
The walls are falling in on me
Through the eyes of a wolf I will see
My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be

Searching for the destiny of kings
Living on broken wings
We're living on broken wings
The walls are falling in on me
Through the eyes of a wolf I will see
My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be
The walls are falling in on me
Through the eyes of a wolf I will see
My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be
