CIRCLES

Look into my eyes and tell me everything
I can see through your lies don't try and fuck with me
All of the shit you've done is gonna come out now
I'm tired and sick of this shit don't wanna work it out

Because everything you've done
Is gonna come undone
Don't try and hide your face
Or this will be your final resting place

You said forever
That's another lie you said to me
You said together
But you never really said it too me

I'm going back now too where it all began
I'll take it back now I don't want you back
I'll never be there for you now

This life's too short too care about all the lies
That come out of their mouths
Cold tears at night no longer worth your time or care
Break out from it

This is your time, time to define
Mistreated been beaten
But now it is my time, time to shine
Where coming back

Till the last one screams
Gonna dominate the fucking world
Eternally, from which you came
I feel your pain

This life will feel your rapture
You pay for your demise
This time you'll let your guard down
This time you'll be exposed

Tell your lies
You tell your lies and avoid the truth
Tell your lies
We hear your lies and we cast you out

Can't trust you
Can't trust me
Suffering the ultimate price to pay
Won't trust you, won't trust me

Tear apart what's left and throw away
Can't trust you, can't trust me
Can't trust this life I will betray
Won't trust you, won't trust me

Inside my shell I'll have my say
And what's better
Than burning you alive?
The essence of your skin

This life's too short to care about all the lies
That come out of their mouths
Cold tears at night no longer worth your time or care
Break out from it

This is your time, time to define
Mistreated been beaten
But it is my time, time to shine
You're dead too me (dead to me)
You're dead too me
