KRAZY BITCH

You've mistaken my kindness for weakness
Everything I had you tried to destroy
Hate is a strong word
But when it comes to you it's not

It's your own fault that you went
Crazy and lost the plot
Words can't describe how you made me feel
Stealing someone's identity is beyond surreal
A year and a half I'll never get back
All because you secretly smoked the crack

Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out
Filled with rage, temper climbs to boiling point now
Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out

But after all that's said and done the last laugh is mine
It's easy to forget, but you can't leave it alone
You destroyed everything, just like a cyclone (psycho)

I never gave up
I never gave in
You're gonna pay for all the shit that you did
You walked into my life and fucked not only mine
You are the biggest mistake that this world can contrive

Fire it up, breathe it in exhale out
Filled with rage, temper climbs to boiling point now
Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out

But after all that's said and done the last laugh is mine
Stuck in this nightmare for so long
This growing hatred of you so strong

You've mistaken my kindness for weakness
Everything I had you tried to destroy
Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out
Filled with rage, temper climbs to boiling point now
Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out

But after all that's said and done the last laugh is mine
Stuck in this nightmare for so long
This growing hatred of you so strong
You've mistaken my kindness for weakness
Everything I had you tried to destroy
