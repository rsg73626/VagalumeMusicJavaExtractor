VULTURES

When you're burnt out and weak
When you're torn down to your knees
Is there anybody out there?

When there's vultures at your back
The light is dying now
Is there anybody out there?

When you're lost in your head
When you feel like you're dead
Is there anybody out there?

I heard whispers of your voice
I awoke to the call
From my conscience recalling

The past several years (the past several years)
I thought I had control
But as time takes its toll

This is only the beginning
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

When you're burnt out and weak
When you're torn down to your knees
Is there anybody out there?

When there's vultures at your back
The light is dying now
Is there anybody out there?

I'll have my words cut deep within the stone
Locked away forever safe and never to be shown
I'll sacrifice every single bone to protect the lessons learned

My worth I'll take the throne!
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

I'll have my words cut deep within the stone
Locked away forever safe and never to be shown
I'll sacrifice every single bone to protect the lessons learned
My worth I'll take the throne

When you're broken
When you're weak
When you're torn down to your knees

When there's vultures at your back
The light is dying now
You are only as strong as the army that stands behind you
You are only as strong as the army that follows your lead

When you're burnt out and weak
When you're torn down to your knees
Is there anybody out there?

When there's vultures at your back
The light is dying now
Is there anybody out there?

When you're lost in your head
When you feel like you're dead
Is there anybody out there?
