THE DARKEST ROAD

It's not enough to know I'm breathing
I've got to feel like it all has meaning
I couldn't cope with the easy path
So I'll take the darkest road and hope I last

You'll never get to me
With all the shit you speak
Your words mean nothing
All your talk is fucking cheap

You don't know where you stand
You closer to the edge
One more step and you'll be falling

It's not enough to know I'm breathing
I've got to feel like it all has meaning
I couldn't cope with the easy path
So I'll take the darkest road and hope I last

Your words won't set you free
From this reality that you've created
You don't belong here
Your luck's about to change
With every step you take
You're getting closer to the fucking edge

You've got to burn to feel
You've got to burn to shine
You either sink to the bottom
Or you can swim with the tide

It's not enough to know I'm breathing
I've got to feel like it all has meaning
I couldn't cope with the easy path
So I'll take the darkest road and hope I last

I'm breathing new life
I'm running free
If there be thorns then let it be

I'm not shaking
I'm not broken
There's more to see than what meets the eye
I'm not faded
It's not over
My blood is thick and my pulse is alive

It's not enough to know I'm breathing
I've got to feel like it all has meaning
I couldn't cope with the easy path
So I'll take the darkest road and hope I last
