DAWN TO RISE

My vengeance for this world is not too go unchanged
And every chance I've taken back
Before your poisoned heart and emptiness
And so I take this vow and take it all too

And so this is what we are
There nothing left existence
My only vow
To send it all to hell

So this is who were are
So fuck your fears
There is just nothing left
Everyday I'm taking in

Tormenting my ambitions
Such words can't breach the night
Been put in this position
Waiting for the dawn to rise

Everyday I thought you've known
I've taken everything
And it will never be the same
I have lost everything and so
You tear apart my life in the shame
Before your pain

And so this is what we are
There nothing left existence
My only vow to send it all to hell
So this is who were are
So fuck your fears

There is just nothing left
Everyday I'm taking in
Tormenting my ambitions
Such words can't breach the night

Been put in this position
Waiting for the dawn to rise
So what the fuck are you waiting for?
I will outstand forever in your light

I, I, I, I, I, lay, lay, lay
Tormenting my ambitions
Such words can't breach the night
Been put in this position
Waiting for the dawn to rise
