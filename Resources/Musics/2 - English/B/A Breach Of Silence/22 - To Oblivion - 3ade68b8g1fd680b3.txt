TO OBLIVION

There is nothing left give
There is nothing left to say
Are you ready for something new
This life and your damnation

Everything I'm gonna tear it
Down to seal your fate
Your time has come
My life in your own eyes is enough too
Take forth this world in demise

Free your mind
In a quest to abort this world
Free your time
In oblivion we can't sustain

Am I losing my mind?
Am I destined to walk this line?
Its time to die! I'll watch you burn
And watch the flames

Fulfil the duties of the crown
Spread my blood across the ground
Overthrown and tossed away
Order's back this time to stay

With honour and pride we shall reign
Through the storm
We fight to embrace another day

Open the gates
Send the flames into the sky
Where they'll remain
Here I remain
Light the sky in the way in which they came

Fulfil the duties of the crown
Spread my blood across the ground
Overthrown and tossed away
Order's back this time to stay

With honour and pride, we shall reign
Through the storm we fight
To embrace another day

You want too scream and shout
Scream until your lungs give out
Scream and shout
Scream until you lungs give out
You, live and fall
Fight for all
