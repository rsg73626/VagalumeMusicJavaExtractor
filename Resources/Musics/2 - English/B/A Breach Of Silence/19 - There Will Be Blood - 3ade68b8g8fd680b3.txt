THERE WILL BE BLOOD

Is there something worth fighting for?
No more too repent
Is there something worth dying for through suffering?

Seize the day
No more embrace
Truth be told
There will be blood, so no remorse

Too be dead is too be at peace
Engraved is r. I. p
In the grass sitting on my knees

As the pain runs through me
As the pain runs through me

Seize the day (there will be blood)
No more embrace (inside us all)
Truth be told
There will be blood, so no remorse

No more survivors
There will be blood
There'll be no more suffering
As the photo lays in harmony
Until I take you head

My visions be
Lost within
Lost within me
My vengeance will be

Seize the day (there will be blood)
No more embrace (inside us all)
Truth be told
There will be blood, so no remorse
