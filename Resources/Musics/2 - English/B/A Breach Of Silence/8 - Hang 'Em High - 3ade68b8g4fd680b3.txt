HANG 'EM HIGH

You march to the sound of chains around your feet
You're afraid to fall because you know what it brings
The heaven you know is not the hell that you're in
You pull the trigger and I'll take your sins

How does it feel to know there's nothing left?
How does it feel to have the rope around your neck?
Staring down a smoking barrel
The pieces that are left haunt you till your last breath

I'm gonna hold what's in my hand
And I'm thinking of ways to ignite
And I'm not forsaken
Nothing can erase this from my eyes
I will be right here till the end

Curse every soul
Every moment that led to this
I hope it feels like your bleeding out
I hope your whole world
Comes crashing down

Do you feel lucky?
Well do ya punk?
You've burned all your bridges
Enough is enough

I'm gonna hold what's in my hand
And I'm thinking of ways to ignite
And I'm not forsaken
Nothing can erase this from my eyes
I will be right here till the end

Curse every soul
Every moment that led to this
I hope it feels like your bleeding out
I hope your whole world
Comes crashing down

Witness the end
I've taken all that I can take
Set them free
Hit the lights
String em up
Hang em high

You march to the sound of chains around your feet
You're afraid to fall because you know what it brings
The heaven you know is not the hell that you're in
You pull the trigger and I'll take your sins
