IMMORTAL

Life's path untold to all who walk the frayed and windy road
Ghosts from the past rise up to haunt their weak and empty soul
Stick in the sand to mark out our legacy, cut short by the unknown
Tides rise above you now, washed away, not yet fully grown

Deceive me
This life was torn away
Retrieve all the things
That make this a better day

Just once now
I'd like to say
Retrieve all the things
That make this a better day

Growing up was the time of our lives
Every day we watch the world go by
We were raised to be kings
Never fearing the vicious lullaby

Blinded by fate and virtue
Watching life get torn from our arms
I'm standing, waiting now
Life's warrior bound to be disarmed

Deceive me
This life was torn away
Retrieve all the things
That make this a better day

Just once now
I'd like to say
Retrieve all the things
That make this a better day

My story falls on deaf ears
The glory stalled for all these years
My candle burnt, the light appears

In death we see truth
Twisted tale of sweetened memories
What I'd give to have you back here
Standing next to me

The unknown beast of fate
The vicious one casts out one last cry
I know you're watching me
The eagle soars until the last one dies

Deceive me
His life was torn away
Retrieve all the things
That make this a better day

Just once now
I'd like to say
Retrieve all the things
That make this a better day
