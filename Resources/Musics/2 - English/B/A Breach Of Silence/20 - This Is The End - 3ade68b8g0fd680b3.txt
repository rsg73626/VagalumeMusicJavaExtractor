THIS IS THE END

Let's say a prayer to forgive and forget
Get on your knees there's no time for regret
Now take the lords hand and close your eyes
The burn you feel is met with a smile

You moved the strings and the puppets danced on
The mountain we built wasn't yours to own
These pockets you lined were yours alone
The people you've used you bled to the bone

Your world will come crashing down
You wave your wand and people will follow
But you're not used to this
So get down and swallow

The pieces fall from the mirror
Prepare yourself to descend
The reflections becoming clearer
Close your eyes, this is the end

Your mouths writing cheques that your body can't cash
How long do you think that this can really last?
I'd like to see your face when this is done
Take a step back cut your losses and run

The pieces fall from the mirror
Prepare yourself to descend
The reflections becoming clearer
Close your eyes this is the end
This is the end
This is the end of everything
This is the end of everything

Let's say a prayer to forgive and forget
Get on your knees there's no time for regret
Now take the lords hand and close your eyes
The burn you feel is met with a smile
