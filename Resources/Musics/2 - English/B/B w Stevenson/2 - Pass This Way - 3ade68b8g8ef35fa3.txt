PASS THIS WAY

So you packed up your dreams
and tied them with schemes
and put them away till next year.
 
Well, I'm thinking it's wrong
to sing to you a song
when your dreams have all gone away.
 
So I'll be drinkin' my wine
thinkin' it's time
but I should be leavin' today
I'll see you if I pass this way.
 
(do LP "MY MARIA" - 1973)
