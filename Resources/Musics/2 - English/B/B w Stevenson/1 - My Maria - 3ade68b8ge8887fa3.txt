MY MARIA

My Maria
Don't you know I have come a long, long way
I've been longin' to see ya
When she's around she take my blues away

Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer
Lonely highway in the skies

Mar-i-a
Mar-i-a, I love you

My Maria
There were some blue and some low times
Just my thoughts about you bring back
My peace of mind

Gypsy lady
Your a miracle work for me
You set my soul free
Like a ship sailin' on the sea

She is the sunlight
When the skies are grey
She treat me so right lady
Take me away

Mar-i-a
Mar-i-a, I love you
Mar-i-a
Mar-i-a, I love you
