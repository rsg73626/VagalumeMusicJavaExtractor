SOME PEACE

Slightly out of control we thought we had it all
But that night when I called you a fraud
Things got out of hand.

Slightly out of our minds we were just wasting time
And you see my friend there is no end
Unless you land face down on the ground

And I need some peace of mind
And I need some peace of mind

And you realize
And you realize
You collect mistakes like they’re postcards from exotic places
And you realize you were pissing in your own backyard
While you should have said hey and solved the problem

And I need some peace of mind
And I need some peace of mind

Slightly out of our minds we were just wasting time
Slightly out of our minds we were just wasting time

And I need some peace of mind
And I need some peace of mind
