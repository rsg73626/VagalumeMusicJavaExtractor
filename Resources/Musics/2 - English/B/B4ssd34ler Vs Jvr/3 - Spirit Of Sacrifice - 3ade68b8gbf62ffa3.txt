SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE

What began 21 months ago
In the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night
This victory alone is not the change we seek
It is only the chance for us to make that change
And that cannot happen
If we go back to the way things were
It can't happen without you
Without a new spirit of service
A new spirit of sacrifice

It can't happen without you
Without a new spirit of service
A new spirit of sacrifice
