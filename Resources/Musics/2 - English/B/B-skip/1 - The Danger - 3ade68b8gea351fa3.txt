THE DANGER

(1st verse)

Why's dat cuhz they label me a mutha fuccen criminal
if i was to die would anybody notice that im gone
cuhz u can only live life for so long
so when i die say he tryed
the struggles the pain in order to survive
i cant maintain this thang kalled life
and i bet if i was to dissapear
aint no homies no friends gon kare
i look up at the sky saw me smileing down
itz like i had died and no 1 notice me around
and all dese smiles now turn into frowns
somebody save me i bet chu they hear me now
and had a dream a dream of me dead in my grave
oh lord plz tell me dis aint my lass day
i guess its true....
the danger the danger i kant save you

[Chorus:]
and danger danger is what i see
and danger danger is nuthin to me
and danger danger is everywhere i be
and danger danger somebody save me [x2]

(2nd verse)
whys dat may i ask again
what would had happin if my life had came to a end
cuhz i grew up and noticed that i had no friends
march the 7 2011 recarnate regulate on my inn`s
with my flag high i threw up the blue bandana
this one for michelle diamond and anna
much respect to my love ones and
im sorrie that i had to leave so soon
tell pops & mom im still doing goood
same ol homies sleepin bud in the hood
and every mutha fuccin homie stabbed me in my bacc
so when i die u aint even gotta ask
and the good die young thass a fact
and when im gone look towards the future not the past
and tell the homies dat im sorrie that i left so fast
oh lord plz tell me why i didnt last 

[Chorus]
and danger danger is what i see
and danger danger is nuthin to me
and danger danger is everywhere i be
and danger danger somebody save me [x2]

(Msz Unknown - 3rd verse)

the danger the danger surrounds me?i don't think I can survive
Tell myself to hold on it`ll be okay 
pray to god that i`ll make it through today
cuzz I don't wanna die
-everynite i praise the lord wishing it aint my last nite
the struggles & the pain..it all equal life
( B-SKip - oh lord plz explain the danger )
would anybody kare if i was gone and died?
no motivation so a helpless lady like me crys
why trust god? they say u kant trust no stranger
it seems like everyone saying blame her.
i write with blood on the pen
Rest in piece to a good friend again

[Chorus]
and danger danger is what i see
and danger danger is nuthin to me
and danger danger is everywhere i be
and danger danger somebody save me [x2]
