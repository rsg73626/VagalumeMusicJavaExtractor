COMPLICATED

Uh huh, life's like this.
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is.
'Cause life's like this.
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is.

Chill out, what you're yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before.
And if you could only let it be, you would see...
I like you the way you are.
When we're driving in your car,
And you're talking to me one on one, but you've become...

Somebody else round everyone else,
Watching your back like you can't relax,
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me.
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else,
It gets me frustrated.
And life's like this, you...
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break,
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty.
You promised me I'll never going to find you fake it...
no, no, no...

You come over unannounced,
Dressed up like you're something else.
Where you are? And where it's at? You see, you're making me...
Laugh out when you strike your pose.
Take off all your preppy clothes.
You know you're not fooling anyone, when you've become...

Somebody else round everyone else,
Watching your back, like you can't relax,
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me.
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else,
It gets me frustrated.
And life's like this, you...
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break,
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty.
You promised me I'll never going to find you fake it...

no, no, no...(4x)

Chill out, what you're yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before.
And if you could only let it be, you would see...

Somebody else round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax,
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me!
So, tell me!

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else,
It gets me frustrated.
And life's like this, you...
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break,
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty.
You promised me I'll never going to find you fake it...
no, no...

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated? (hey, hey!)
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else,
It gets me frustrated.
And life's like this, you...
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break,
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty.
You promised me I'll never going to find you fake this...
no, no, no...
