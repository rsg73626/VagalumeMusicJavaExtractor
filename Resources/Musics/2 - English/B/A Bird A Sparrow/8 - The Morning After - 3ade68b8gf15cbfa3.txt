THE MORNING AFTER

Tight skirt
Maybe hiked up a little more
I've seen you here once before
You say that you're here for the show
But we all know we all know

You may have the whole crowd hooked on every word
But it's clear to me,
I got it
Yeah, I understood
You make everything look so easy
You got the boys lined up
But your calling
Everything you do,
Everything you say keeps them
Hanging on

You wake up
The next morning
And don't know where you are
Intoxicated,
Completely faded
Without your clothes on

You may have the whole crowd hooked on every word
But it's clear to me,
I got it
Yeah, I understood
You make everything look so easy
You got the boys lined up but you're calling
Everything you do, everything you say keeps them
Hanging

One by one
You break hearts forever
And one by one
We'll never be together
But I'll be there and you'll be waiting
