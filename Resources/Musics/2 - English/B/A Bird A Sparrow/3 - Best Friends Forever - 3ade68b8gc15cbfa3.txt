BEST FRIENDS FOREVER

So heres a story of a boy
Who said he never understood
They grew up together in the same neighborhood

She stole his first kiss at the age of five
And since that day hes been going crazy inside
She tells him how shes afraid of being alone
Oh, he hopes to God he's not in friend zone

I feel sick when she is gone
Stay at home and play her favorite songs
I wish I had one day
Just so she can see what love can truly be

You watched her leave night after night
With the same guys, with the same guys
But you dont have the guts to tell her
That she is wasting her time

And you wonder why
She goes out with everything one but me
He wishes he had the moves to sweep her off her feet

I feel sick when she is gone
Stay at home and play her favorite songs
I wish I had one day
Just so she can see what love can truly be

So heres your chance
Theirs nobody home
Let her know how you can steal her heart away
Shout it out!
So she can hear you sing

I feel sick when she is gone
Stay at home and play her favorite songs
I wish I had one day
Just so she can see what love can truly be  (2x)

I feel sick when she is gone (3x)
Stay at home and play her favorite songs
