THE BITTER TRUTH

It started as love
Love leads us to war
Can I really care enough
Did you even care at all?
It's not the first
And it won't be the last
An addict for dramatic life
It's written in my past

I've seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere left to hide
That could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you

Wherever you are
You break and you scar
You'll never get the best of me
You'll never get that far
As you're breaking down
With no one around
Think of how you got this way
Remember who you are

I've seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere left to hide
That could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you

In airs and graces
Your changing faces
I see it in everyone
See it in everything
Don't stand a chance in sobriety
I can't escape you when I drink
My entire being it swells and retracts
When I think of how you went behind my back
You finally found the guts to keep it honest for once
Remember every lie forget the family you gave up
