SCREAM

Is there anybody out there?
Can you hear me screaming?
Is there a reason to why I'm here?

I'm a dreamer out loud
I'm a voice lost in the crowd
Can you hear the silent sounds
As I'm screaming out now
I've never been heard
Still hang on every word
It's been so long

Is there anybody out there?
Can you hear me screaming?
Is there a reason to why I'm here?
Cause I've never felt so lost
Like I never had it all
Give me a reason to why I'm here

I've been so far from home
I've done it on my own
Lost hope in everything
Been out of control
Now I have hold of this
The last thing on my list
To never turning back
A life I'll never miss
