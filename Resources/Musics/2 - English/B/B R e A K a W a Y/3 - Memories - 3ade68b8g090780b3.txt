MEMORIES

Not a day goes by
With no thought of you
This cold hard winter
Your summer view
Now I can stand here on my own
I'm thinking of you and I'm not alone
On the darkest of nights
When there's no clouds around
I look to the sky
Are you looking now?
At the same two stars
Light the heavens above
Screaming give me my love
Screaming give me my love

You're alive in me
I'm alive in you
It's the memories that get me through
You're alive in me
I'm alive in you
It's the memories that get me through
To you

It's been so long since I saw you last
So much has changed
Time has passed
Now you can't stand there on your own
I've never felt so proud coming home the same two stars
Light the heavens above
Screaming give me my love
Screaming give me my love

You're alive in me
I'm alive in you
It's the memories that get me through
You're alive in me
I'm alive in you
It's the memories that get me through

You're alive in me
You're alive in me (not just a memory)
