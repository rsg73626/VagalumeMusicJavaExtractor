AT THE WORLD'S END

There's a part of me
I thought I'd never know
What it was to love
Never want to let go
Everything in life
Everything I know
Taken beneath my feet

In the crashing lights
When it all came down
As I'm reaching out
Where are you now
I thought you understood
Looks like you never could
Like it's always been

Where are you now
When the world is ending
Let it bring you down
Stop your heart from beating
I hope for one minute, one moment
You think of me and your heart starts hurting
Where are you now
When the world is ending

There's a part of me
I thought I'd never show
Watch me break apart
As I'm letting go
Take away the light
Take everything I know
I can hardly breathe

If this is what you call
You call your honesty
How can you take it back so easily
You might have skeletons
They're so paper thin
Like you are to me

If you kissed me like you will always love me
Then I'd never of let you go
