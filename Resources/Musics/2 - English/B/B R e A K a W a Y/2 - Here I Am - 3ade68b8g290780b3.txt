HERE I AM

If you're lost
Scared you're not alone
I'm always there to bring you home again
I'll never let you go
I see the light
Life still in your eyes
No reason left to run away
To leave it all behind

Here I am
Here my love
Won't let you fall
Won't let you down
If one day
You break away
Here I am
Right here I'll stay
Here I'll stay

I know you're hurt
You feel you're not alive
That you're hanging on inside between
Broken and holding on
I feel your heart
As you whisper in the dark
Let us never be apart again
Never let me go
