THE RHYTHM OF LOVE

Just move your feet to the beat
let the sound flow through you
just feel the movement inside
and let the music take you over 

We have the whole night together
don't throw it all away
heaven is where I am now
and that's the way I want to say 

Just sway your body to mine
each step we take for a life time
nothing can stop us
the power is our love 

Keep our movements in tune
the beat of my heart against you
just feel the music
to keep us going on 

The star above is our witness
to this new love we have
your arms around me so tender
is where I want to be forever 

We have the whole night together
don't throw it all away
heaven is where I am now
and that's the way I want to say 

Heaven is when I'm with you
see how the sun shine in my eyes
keeping them bright every day
since I met you
