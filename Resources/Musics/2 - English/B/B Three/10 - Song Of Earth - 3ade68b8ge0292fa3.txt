SONG OF EARTH

Come hear my song 
of beauty in this land 
the earth and water's blend 
and natures beasts are friends 

Sweet is the air 
where everything is shared 
the wind spread out its warm 
of brotherhood and love 

Happy glow of faces we know 
fills the fantasy of life 
eyes so bright, that light up with love 
can only spring to life 
from deep within 
the very soul 

Reach out your hands 
and pray with all your heart 
surrender all your strength 
to find our peace on earth 

Such beauty only brings 
tears full of joy within
