VATO

I was chillen
Right around my way
21st Eastside of the Beach
This mother fucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies
Like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from
While he runnin' up
Gang bang my set on every one of 'em
Something son they just won't change
Fools don't respect nothin' but the gang bang
What's seen is what's on
Dog is the law
I had you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryin to creep on the ease wit' it
Talkin' 'bout they gon get my chain
And they gon leave wit' it
But they don't know
Once they get close
It's tic tac toe
Three mother fuckers laid on the flo'
(watch out, watch out)
Yea, this happened yesterday
On the west they spray
I heard a ese say, he said

Chorus
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist they fingers, say you know who we are
He say I don't give a fuck, I Snoop Doggy Dogg
They keep talkin' then it went too far
So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged
Run nigga run nigga
Duck nigga duck nigga
Run mother fucker run X2
Run nigga run nigga
Duck nigga duck nigga
Run mother fucker run X2

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three mother fuckers dead
And I ain't seen shit
But these niggas will scream a plea
But for a G like me
It's just a case, really you could see
I crack the mack back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back you drop off fallin'
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I don't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl
You would think that they were brods
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it ya'll, been a Dogg, smoke you like a menethol
You think you know, but this can't go
You think you'll blow, on my door
What the fuck, No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you hear my enemies goin'

Chorus

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist they fingers, say you know who we are
He say I don't give a fuck, I Snoop Doggy Dogg
They keep talkin' then it went too far
So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged
Run nigga run nigga
Duck nigga duck nigga
Run mother fucker run X2
Run nigga run nigga
Duck nigga duck nigga
Run mother fucker run X2

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth
God Damn
And Snoop will keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run wit' dem niggas wit da heat
Ya never seen a thug like this
Ya never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak fo war and peace
In fact I could be Beast of the East
Mother fucka
I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryin' to change his ways
We gotta move our team
Cuz my people is screamin' that we need mo'
For funnel is illegal
Ba-ba-bang on this song
Make it feel like a drive by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I mob in LA
All I hear the ese's say
(They go)

Chorus

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist they fingers, say you know who we are
He say I don't give a fuck, I Snoop Doggy Dogg
They keep talkin' then it went too far
So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged
Run nigga run nigga
Duck nigga duck nigga
Run mother fucker run X2
Run nigga run nigga
Duck nigga duck nigga
Run mother fucker run X2
