STICK WIT HER

[Verse 1: Rame Royal]

I let the dark metal bark wit no emotion
sharply focused
tearin through yo heart like a shark in the ocean
what gave you the notion that you could slow my hustle
take a share my business
I make you bear witness to this Oakland quarter sack vandall
runnin a quarter panell
an you can order that on any rap channel
wit enough ammo an a black flannel
to bury Rambo
writin plans fo my camary land flow.

[Verse 2: B-Legit]

I swang loose at night
Sav-el wit stripes
train in mist to be a killa
9-8 Vern Miller
fill it to the top wit the Aiwa duce
an no game niggas get the fuck cut loose
7-duce tonight
I roll one right
a vet on a set still trumped up tight
work streets at night
Supreme so clean
gettin money from the block like a slot machine.

[Verse 3: Niki Scarfo]

I turn the blocks to war zones
hin & juice fills my cantine
I'm at home when I blast chrome to keep the pressure on beam
murder scenes
he got hit when he crossed the grain
no time to explain
two in his brain, that's the game
fuck the fame
I want the fortune
the best place is outta town
the Vill was scorchin
years an years of drama
creeps, murder beef
seems niggas lost sleep over freaks caught up between the sheets.

[Chorus: Richie Rich]

Niggas need the money and the muscle
picture that
a hog, a pimp, an two dogs wit no muzzles
in an everyday struggle
we had to hustle
my camp
stay amped about the stamp spender.
Chick getter
hard hitter
got a bitch in the club, Stick Wit Her
nigga, cuz if we get her
we gon' have it our way
hard times an connected wit the Bay.

[Verse 4: Richie Rich]

I'm screamin "Silence peeps"
come down them streets
4 point 4 pounds of blow is two ki's
sticky finger
hit each kick for 6 zips
slick nigga paintin my town in new whips
the coke bouncer
low number announcer
12 zones short nigga finna take him court
it's my click
I know they notice, we evict
we on some mo fuck a bitch, slang rock shit
check this.

[Verse 5: Rame Royal]

I slang a bomb of quarter back like Randall
drop back
caulk back the gat
blow out yo candle
to hot to hold
to hard to handle when I unload
still knockin jumbo
watchin for Columbo
rock it to the top of the pot like gumbo
paparazzi spot feds wit Royal to crumble
been breakin bread an tryin to count much more
makin big heads til my pockets look like Mount Rushmore.

[Verse 6: Niki Scarfo]

My games uphold
to push a Rolls puffin doe
while I'm seen sellin soda goes beyond golden flows
from the Vill to weight holders
weighed his vest down
an still got touched jumpin outta Range Rovers
5 g's to a soldier
and 5 after
fuck the feds
and he finally got a chapter
cuz juss the heat the streets be crucial
so believe when you face this killa the feelin mutual.

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 7: B-Legit]

I gots 2 pits wit me an they tone the pimp
go hard
a nigga disregard that lip
pump it down in yo hole
the green in yo doe
got bitches movin shit out department stores
it's H-O-Z dedicated to work
like to pull on my colla when I pimp it work
if it's yo skirt
she choose ya lose
either that or the d-boy blues.
Biatch.

[Verse 8: Richie Rich]

Nigga refer to the hook see the clothes by the bitch
it's real shit
remember the muscle an same hustle
wants free hustle put yo mind at ease
smoke weed
a nigga do whatever he please
two dogs
one hog
an one pimp
pushin heir-ron, coke, ex an hemp
niggas got this game at a stand still
keep the land filled wit leaves of coke until my hands filled.

[Chorus x2]
