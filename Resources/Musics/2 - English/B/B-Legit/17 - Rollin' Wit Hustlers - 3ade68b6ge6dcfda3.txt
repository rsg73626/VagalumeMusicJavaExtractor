ROLLIN' WIT HUSTLERS

Only mess with those hustlers
Never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
Never mess with no bustas

B-Legit:
Addyup(?) cuz' they done fucked
Wit a nigga tryin' to get a buck
I leave 'em stuck posted up at a stand still
Beat the case off of Dan Vill (?)
Now I'm back for the overkill, hundred dollar bills
Stuffed in the duffel bag (duffel bag)
5 pounds in the back of the deuce rag
So Harm could ya, would ya help the big fella'
Tell 'em how you about that scrilla

Harm:
It goes down like Brandy
Peruvian, mother of pearl, caucasion white bitch
Dirty white girl, uncut raw like Eddy
Sharp like a 'chete
Steady on the program
With missions to get fetti
And I'm ready
On the pedal heavy when I smash
The same muthafucka that hit the gas and dash
To the other side on the down low
'Cuz I only deal with hustlers not bustas you know

Only mess with those hustlers
Never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
Never mess with no bustas

B-Legit:
And not too many get to ride with me
And you know how a punk ass bitch can be
A snitch to me
Heart pump on hundred
And probably ain't neva' gonna' have no money

Harm:
I know the same situations
But know the vocations to a brother that's lack
No muscles in your crack
What happened to all the days that you spent hustlin'
Now everytime I see ya' you be strugglin'

B-Legit:
The batch betta have my cav
And keep the shit comin like the little big rabbit
Dag nabbit
I gotta have it to support
Can't come up short
So I'm still selling with the super sport

Harm:
I'm still independent
But in a minute I'ma be laughing
I got it straight from B-Legit
Told me, Harm you can have this
So I had to get to focus
Left fools all wet
No jokin' in this game that I play
And representin' with hustlers eryday

Only mess with those hustlers
Never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
Never mess with no bustas

Harm:
A funkin we goin' go
In a carpice fo' door
Ready for war
Suspects get took
Playin' the wrong crooks
Legit, Harm wit firearm
And you quiet like storm

B-Legit:
In-fra-red
Niggaz fled from the street side
From a nigga droppin' mess in a fleet side
Niggaz ride to blast wit no mass in the broad daylight
See I neva fuck with bustas at night

Harm:
Game tight
'Cuz the game be thick
Gotta watch out who ya fuk wit
'Cuz bustas die quick
So Legezee
Would you let ya' playa pezee knezee
How it goes dezee in the tezee

B-Legit:
For shezee
The savage moves chickens like a Mexican
And I'm back to writin' bad ass checks again
Well check yo' chin
Bitch believe that
Stays nathin' but game so receive that

(X2)
Only mess with those hustlers
Never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
Never mess with no bustas

Harm: (X4)
Only mess with huslters right
