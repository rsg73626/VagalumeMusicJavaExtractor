DON'T WAIT FOR US

You'd better be ready for the dark days
They're coming for
You'd better be ready for the dark days
They're coming for you
If you fail
If you fall
What's gonna happen to your people
So be ready for the dark days
They're coming for you

Don't wait for us
Don't wait for us to be gone
Don't wait for us
Don't wait for us to be gone

You've never been running in the black rain
That's coming for
You'd rather hit the road, not to look back 'cause
They're coming for you
Rising from
The ashes
Screaming loud 'till the tears
They'll be waiting for you to fail
They'll be watching you

Don't wait for us
Don't wait for us to be gone
Don't wait for us
Don't wait for us to be gone
