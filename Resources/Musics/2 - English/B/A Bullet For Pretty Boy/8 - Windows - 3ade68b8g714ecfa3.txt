WINDOWS

How can we bridge the path from dark to light?
If we live like the rest, can we portray his love?

We are the window
What we do is for you
Can we be your hands?

Burn these walls
Let your light shine through this veil
Burn these walls
Let your light shine through

We are the window [x2]

We must set our own hearts straight to lead the weak

We'll give ourselves to you
To see the truth within in your hands [x2]

Oh God, take it all
Fill my lungs
Give me life [x2]

We were hollow men
We were hollow men

Consume me
Consume me

And I am choosing what I will let decide
Who I will become
With all this shame pulling at my feet
I will run to you

What can I do
To make this wretch pure?
All of me
Use all of me for you [x2]

We must set our own hearts straight to lead the weak into the promise land [x4]
(You still give us hope)

This is my flesh
Nothing more than a book
Of redemption and regrets [x2]

Burn these walls
Let your light shine through this veil
Burn these walls
Let your light shine through
