DIAL M, FOR MURDER

Its your light that guides me
Welcoming a brand new life my path has been set straight
Im dancing with this fire im dance with you flame
You know that this scares you, he knows this as well
Go in the right path and you shall not fail

And now im walking on my mistakes
Its all where im going not where ive been

Youâ€™re the blood of Gods creation
Let life begin

Cinderella Cinderella night and day its Cinderella

Keep my hear keep me here ive got to stay ive got to stay

(guide my heart)
We are living we are standing here
We are living we are living

Take my hand ill show you everything
No questions remain this is a war
