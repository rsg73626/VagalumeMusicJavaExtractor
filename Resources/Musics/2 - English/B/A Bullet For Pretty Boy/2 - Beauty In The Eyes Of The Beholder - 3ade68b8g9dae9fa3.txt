BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER

Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God where do I run
Your message holds true though we fall short
(Were all trying to let ourselves know the secrets they give us the hope
We?ve recognized and realized these voices will tell us where to go.)

Bring your love down father I?m giving you my shield and my sword
So that you can guide me
Too many times I?ve tryed
but the ever so inviting says

takes ahold of me not now not tonight
Please ask me these questions that I answer 
Ao desperately in search of something more
The memories of my past I can?t seem to overcome to overcome

But millions upon millions seem to forget that your love is real
Not the ways of the world
Your love is so real
Your love is so real

I will open my ears, I will open my heart 
Just to hear what you want me to hear
Incline your ear, to my ear
OH GOD, we were wrong
Incline you ear to my ear
