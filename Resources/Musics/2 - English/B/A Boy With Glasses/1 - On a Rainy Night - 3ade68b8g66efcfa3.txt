ON A RAINY NIGHT

Don't cry
The phone won't ring
I'll try to forget you
Maybe in a month's time

This feels like free-falling down
Yeah, I know, you're the one who has to go
But please not tonight

Won't this light of joy
Show when I get back home?
I'll never forget
Even if I try my best
To not get lost again
I know that the times
Are changing again

No, you won't
No, you won't
Yeah, I will
I want you still
I want you still
