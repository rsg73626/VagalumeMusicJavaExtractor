ONE BEDROOM BLUES

I feel like a monster
Is under my bed
Ready to eat me
Did I drink too much?
I don't know

I head for the kitchen
And open the fridge
But there's nothing in there
It's been like that since you've left

But I'm trying my best to cope
With the idea that you are gone
That I'm left with your dog
Who won't trust me and eats my rugs

When I was with you
I used to eat lots
Of fruits and vegetables
Now it's bacon and eggs
My stomach aches

I'm not into football
But I still stare at the TV set
Pretending I give a shit

But I'm trying my best to cope
With the idea that you are gone
And I'm left with your dog
Who won't trust me and eats my rugs

Was I ready for this?
Did I deserve it?
Maybe I did
I like to feel guilty

But I'm trying my best to cope
With the idea that you are gone
And I'm left with your dog
Who won't trust me and eats my rugs
