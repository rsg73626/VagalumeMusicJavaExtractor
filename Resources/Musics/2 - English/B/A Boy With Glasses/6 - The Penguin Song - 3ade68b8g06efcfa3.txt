THE PENGUIN SONG

It was hard leaving my family down at the South Pole
But I couldn't resist the temptation of that ship
It had a sign saying "One way cargo - USA"

My friends, they told me not to go
But I think I really like it here
There's plenty of fish and chips and beer
And I really love watching TV

And if I start to feel too hot
There's always ice packs at the mart
It's just about a mile down from here

Does it sound strange that I'm a penguin
Driving through Connecticut?
I'm going to find a friend that I've never met before

They tell me she's really tall
But sure knows how to dance

My friends, they told me not to go
But I think I really like it here
There's plenty of fish and chips and beer
And I really love watching TV

And if I start to feel too hot
There's always ice packs at the mart
It's just about a mile down from here

Do you think it was easy to be in there?
It was always blackened snow
I could find something better than it (?)

My friends, they told me not to go
But I think I really like it here
There's plenty of fish and chips and beer
And I really love watching TV

And if I start to feel too hot
There's always ice packs at the mart
