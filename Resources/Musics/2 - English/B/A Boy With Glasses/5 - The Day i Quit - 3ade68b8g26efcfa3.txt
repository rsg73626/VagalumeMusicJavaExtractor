THE DAY I QUIT

They showed me to the woods
Said I should sit and wait
"The dealer with the stuff
Ain't gonna be late."

It's starting to get dark
And no one's showing up
I'm starting to think
I was better off staying at home

There's a van stopping by
There's a strange guy inside
Takes my money
And gives me my goodbye pills

As I drive my car home
As I think about the times
When I didn't need all this shit
To still feel alive

Lights flashing by
A policeman inside says
"Son, do you mind
Getting out of the car?"

He asks me what do I have
Then takes the pills from my hands
Says I'm good and drives off
With my precious stuff
