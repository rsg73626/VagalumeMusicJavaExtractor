IF YOU WANT TO BE

If you want to be my lover 
If you want to be my lover… 
If you want to be my lover… 
If you want to be my lover… Lover … Lover 

Chorus:
If you want to be my lover… 
If you want to be my lover… 
If you want to be my lover… 
If you want to be my lover 

You can help me in the darkness 
We are happy in the blue sky 
I want you every moment 
Cause You are the love of my life 

Chorus
If you want to be my lover... 
If you want to be my lover...
If you want to be my lover...
If you want to be my lover 

You can find me in your heart now 
It's so nice to be happy 
All I really really know is 
That You are the love of my life, Oh oh oh 

You can help me in the darkness 
We are happy in the blue sky 
I want you every moment 
Cause You are the love of my life 

Chorus
If you want to be my lover... 
If you want to be my lover...
If you want to be my lover...
If you want to be my lover [x2]
