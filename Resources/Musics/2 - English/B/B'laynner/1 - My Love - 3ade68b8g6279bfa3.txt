MY LOVE

At night when I close my eyes
I always think of you
I do not know what is happening
But I know what will happen
I need a chance
Just one chance
To show you
Everything is different now

(Chorus:)

So do not say it's too late
Do not tell me you forgot
Do not say you just forever
Why you are the my life is my love

At night when I close my eyes
I always think of you
I do not know what is happening
But I know what will happen
I need a chance
Just one chance
To show you
Everything is different now
At night when I close my eyes
I always think of you
I do not know what is happening
But I know what will happen
I need a chance
Just one chance
To show you
Everything is different now

(Chorus:)

So do not say it's too late
Do not tell me you forgot
Do not say you just forever
Why you are the my life is my love
So do not say it's too late
Do not tell me you forgot
Do not say you just forever
Why you are the my life is my love
