MY HEAD

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your love is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

I just can't... think about
I just can't... think about
Your love is all I think about

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Set me free
Feel the need in me

I just can't... think about
I just can't... think about
Your love is all I think about

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
