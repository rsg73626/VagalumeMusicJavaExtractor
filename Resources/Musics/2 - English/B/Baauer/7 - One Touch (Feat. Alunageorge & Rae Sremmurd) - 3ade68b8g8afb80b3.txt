ONE TOUCH (FEAT. ALUNAGEORGE & RAE SREMMURD)

I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so you're gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I don't ever wanna be empty

I just popped a Senzu bean
I said I just popped a Senzu bean
Mama where I leave my memory?
Probably the same place I left my id (hey)
Y-3's, gave a young n***a wings
I sneeze, gave a young n***a steeze
Five G's, fall like leaves
In the spring Imma run it like police, we be clubbing
1800's, bubbling a nigga's stomach
Three girls, so that mean I'm in here juggling
She might have a man, I might have a girl
But neither one of 'em at the club so who give a f**k
Arrived on the scene with some booty shakin' hoes
And they not the twerk team
All these hoes got their hands on they knees
I said all these hoes got their hands on they knees

I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so you're gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I don't ever wanna be empty

Goin' clubbin'
I beat the p***y up left the girl on crutches
I'm goin' clubbin'
You know that I'm bout to gonna slice up the dutchies
I'm goin' clubbin'
Tell me when she ready just hit me on my phone
Goin' clubbin'
If you got some foo' friends b***h don't come along
Let me make a scene
Ooh if you bad I might just put you in the ring
Ooh if you bad I might just buy you that machine
Ooh if you bad I might just dress you so clean
Woah, how you wear your hair
Make a n***a want to buy you this
Take you down to Paris and ice out your wrist
Chew you like a n***a did when he was a six
I make it look easy

I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so you're gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I don't ever wanna be empty

All I really need is one touch
I want you to put it right here all night
All I need is one touch
I want you to put it right here
All I really need is one touch
I want you to put it right here all night
All I need is one touch
I want you to put it right here
You're gonna make me drag your a** over here
I don't mind, cause I've got no fear
In your eyes, it's written clear (it's written clear)
You're gonna make me, drop my guard to the floor
I don't mind, but I need some more
So be kind and make me sure (make me sure)
I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so you're gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I don't ever wanna be empty
All I really need is one touch
I want you to put it right here on me
All I need is one touch
I want you to put it right here
