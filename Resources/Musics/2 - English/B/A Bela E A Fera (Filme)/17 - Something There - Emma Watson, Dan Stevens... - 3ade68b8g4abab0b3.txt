SOMETHING THERE - EMMA WATSON, DAN STEVENS...

There's something sweet, and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear, and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New, and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought? Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known?

Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?

It's so peculiar, wait and see
we'll wait and see a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Here's a thought, perhaps there's something there
that wasn't there before

What mama?
There may be something there that wasn't there before

What is it, what's there?
I'll tell you when you're older
Okay, I'm older
Chip, oh
