THE MOB SONG - LIKE EVANS, JOSH GAD...

The beast will make off with your children
He'll come after them in the night
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall

I say we kill the beast!
We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
So it's time to take some action boys
It's time to fol-low-me
Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
'Till he's dead, good and dead kill the beast
No, I won't let you do this
If you're not with us, you're against
Bring the old man
Get your hands off me
We can't have them running off to warn the creature
Let us out
We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me
Get your torch, mount you horse
Through your courage to the stinking place
We're counting on your stud to lead the way
Through a mist to the wood, where we see a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast, just as tall as a mountain
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased
Steady fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow
Let's get on and here we go
We'll lay siege to the castle, and bring back his head
We have to warn the beast this is all my fault
Oh papa what are we going to do
Now, now
We'll think of something
We don't like what we don't
Understand and in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save children and and your wives
So save our village and our lives
Lets kill the beast
I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all
Could it be
Is it she
Scara bleu! Invaders
Encroachers
And they 'ave the mirror
Warn the master If it's a fight they want
We'll be ready for them Who's with me! Arrgh
Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The beast is mine
Find a place, stand aside, we go marching into battle
Unafraid of all the things you just decreed
Raise the ram, sing this song
Here we come at fifty strong
If fifty Frenchmen can be wrong
Let's kill the beast
Pardon me, Master
Leave me in peace
But sir! The castle is under attack
Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast
This isn't working
Oh Lumiere, we must do something
Wait, I know
Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast
What shall we do, Master
It doesn't matter now
Just let them come
Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast
