ARIA - AUDRA MCDONALD

Oh, how divine
Glamour, music, and magic combine
See the maidens so anxious to shine
Look for a sign that enhances chances
She'll be his special one

What a display
What a breathtaking, thrilling array
Every prince, every dog has his day
And I'll sing with passion, gusto, fit to bust
Oh, not a care in the world!
