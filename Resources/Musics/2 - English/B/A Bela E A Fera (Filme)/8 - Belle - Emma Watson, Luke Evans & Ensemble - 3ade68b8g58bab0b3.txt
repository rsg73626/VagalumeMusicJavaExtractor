BELLE - EMMA WATSON, LUKE EVANS & ENSEMBLE

Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town, full of little people

Waking up to say

Bonjour! Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

Good Morning, Belle!

Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Probably, miss, but I, I can't remember what
Oh, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you up to?

To take this book to
It's about to lovers in

Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour! Good day!
How is your family?
Bonjour! Good day!
How is your wife?
I need six eggs!
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

(Speaking segment)

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favourite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair fa√ßade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!

(Speaking segment)

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Woman 1: Bonjour!
Luke Evans: Pardon
Emma Watson: Good day
Woman 2: Mais oui!
Woman 3: You call this bacon?
Woman 4: What lovely grapes!
Man 1: Some cheese
Woman 5: Ten yards!
Man 1: 'one pound
Luke Evans: Excuse me
Cheese merchant: I'll get the knife
Luke Evans: Please let me through!
Woman 6: This bread
Woman 7: Those fish
Woman 6: It's stale!
Woman 7: They smell!
Men: Madame's mistaken
Women: Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes
The girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!
