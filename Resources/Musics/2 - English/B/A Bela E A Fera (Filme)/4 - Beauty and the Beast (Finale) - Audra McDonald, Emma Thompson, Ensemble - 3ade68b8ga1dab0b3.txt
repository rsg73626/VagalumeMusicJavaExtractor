BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (FINALE) - AUDRA MCDONALD, EMMA THOMPSON, ENSEMBLE

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

[Mrs. Potts]
Winter turns to spring
Famine turns to feast
Nature points the way
Nothing left to say
Beauty and the Beast

[All]
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
