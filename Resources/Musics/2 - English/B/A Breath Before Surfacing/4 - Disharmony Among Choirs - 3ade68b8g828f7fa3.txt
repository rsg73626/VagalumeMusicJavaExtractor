DISHARMONY AMONG CHOIRS

OH THE BRUTALITY 
It’s enough to make me want to scream 
FUCK I’M SO ANGRY 
What kind of person would listen to something so hateful? 
It’s become more than just music 
It’s a motive to kill 
If it hasn’t taken control yet it surely will 
The blood will spill 
Too many blast beats have rattled loose my brain 
Every time I hear a fucking break down it drives me insane 
Don’t look so surprised 
I see the desperation in their eyes 
Legions of murderers await 
ALL HAIL METAL 
No one is safe 
The West Memphis Three ain’t got nothing on me 
I’m blowing more minds than Stained Class and Suicide Solution combined with Columbine 
It’s not insensitive if it’s satire 
I’m holding back, but not anymore 
I make Ozzy and Priest look like Potsie and Screech 
How’s that for ruthless? 
So come with me I will introduce you to a life of depravity in time 
I’m not a bad guy but don’t mistake my kindness for weakness 
I wear my heart on my sleeve except all my shirts are sleeveless 
I’m sorry you just don’t understand but this is not for you 
We’ve readied our axes within our clenching hands 
Now we begin our aural assault 
Society is doomed 
NO ONE IS SAFE 
WHILE THIS METAL IS RUNNING THROUGH OUR VEINS
