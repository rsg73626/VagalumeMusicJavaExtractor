AT THE BLUE GATES OF DEATH

Before and beyond
The blue gates of death
Oh only two birds
They soar through the sky
Take two blackbirds
Crossformed on poppy fields
And sprung in the springtime
Of Europe's fertile years
When the rain was immaculate
not redrose invisible

And where in the heart
That beats in man
And where in the soul
That beats in this heart
May we find pastures
Of the little shining man?
Eagle, his hand in hand
Eagle, his glass in hand
Birch, she sits there scowling
Anothe Eagle darkens the stage
(She tells me she loves me
But he always beckons)

They have reached
The blue gates of death
They are at
The blue gates of death
They shall go through
The blue gates of death
And on the rocks
The moss is everywhere
And the sky is blackblue
And it is darkening
Statues point to the sky
Birth
Earth
And dawn

And I believe
Christ is the Son of God
And I believe
Christ is His Son

Her eyes are horizontal
Like her secret
There is no pain for me to feel
"Do not touch this pain of mine"
She says
"It is darkened fear"
And London Bridge
Has fallen down
My mother sits in the kitchen
She's drinking
Victoria gin
And she's eating
Gingerbread men
Two ciphers straddle the stage
Reclaim, declaim and decant
Their moves are pointless
Their promises echo through the night
We have all reached
The blue gates of death
We are at the opening
Of the blue gates of death

And Christ's name
Is carved in stone
But the time has soaked it away
Where the rain runs to the sea
It takes moisture from the world
Where riverruns to the sea
It drags ships in its courses
And the blue turns to green
Behind the roses
Fields and pastures
Madness is the horn
And laughing is the wine
Full garlands hang
On the head of the porcupine god

Everyone reaches
The blue gates of death
Everything opens
No journey is without meaning
Every road has its end

And I shall die soon
And you shall die soon
And no luggage is carried
On the opening
To the gates of death
Death is no ending

It is the beginning
I shall not take you with me
But your face rests in my heart
Your soul is part of my soul
Your love is with me always
I shall remember you
in the darkness
That's to come
And flashing lights beckon
Another womb
Another life
At the blue gates of death
I loved you once
I shall love you again
Do not feel pain
Nothing lasts in the world
I loved you once
I shall love you again
I loved you once
I love you again
