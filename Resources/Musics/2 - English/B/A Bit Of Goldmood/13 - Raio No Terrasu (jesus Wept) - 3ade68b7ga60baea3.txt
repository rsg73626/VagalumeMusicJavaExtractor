RAIO NO TERRASU (JESUS WEPT)

These are my hands
And there are my eyes
Clad in high high hills
Impotent
The leper lord
Clad in bloody robes
Jesus wept
Jesus
Jesus wept
Christus
Hear me when I call
On the threshing floor
Jesus wept
On the threshing floor
My loves
My little friends
My loves
Antichrist
Antichristus
Antichrist
We know who you are
Threshing
On the threshing floor
My loves
Antichrist
We know who thou art
Dies irae
Dies illa
We know who you are
Lacrimosae
Jesus
Mea culpa
Jesus wept
Mea culpa
Jesus wept
Have mercy on us
Jesus wept
Between the power
And the glory
Falls the shadow
The shadow falls
Wept
Jesus wept
Life is very short
Jesus wept
