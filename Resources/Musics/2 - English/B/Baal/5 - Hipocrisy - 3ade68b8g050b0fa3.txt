HIPOCRISY

I´ve seen the decay of the believers
I´ve seen the sunset in the horizon
I´ve felt the beat strength of the universe
Taken by the rages thoughts of their minds
Of their minds
I can´t believe in the rest of the creatures
I can´t believe in people´s gestures
I don´t get how they´re still afraid of them
I´ve thought about doing it again,
So many times
Beliefs that have our dream incarnates,
Frightening yells that occupy the desert,
Chained madness the hands with shackles,
Lies that weight like stoned things

What do you plan to do, when you looking of yesterday?
What do you propose for it
Not to succumb gain?

I don´t want to explain what your eyes see
I don´t want to look what´s eternal
I don´t want to go down the infernal stairs
I don´t pretend to be the object to your lies
Thoughts of death strike your mind today
Thoughts of looser will win someday
Any reason is right to attack
Nothing excuses you from not wanting to pay,
Pay your lies

What do you plan to do, when you looking of yesterday?
What do you propose for it
Not to succumb again?
