SOLITUDE

Do you feel the wind of the space?
Lonely lights that are lighting opened space at night
I´m in line waiting for the moon to come out
Now the silhouettes will be seen
The time has stopped for me
I see the stars and I will wait forever
Dead people around me looking at me and telling
About the things of their worlds

Oh!, I´m with my eyes closed trying to understand
The meaning that the dream produces me
Everything here is solitude and tranquillity
I think I´ll never understand it
Oh! I dream with lonely worlds abandoned,
Cities where I hear the wind going through its streets
I hear far away a horse that runs to be yet more free.
