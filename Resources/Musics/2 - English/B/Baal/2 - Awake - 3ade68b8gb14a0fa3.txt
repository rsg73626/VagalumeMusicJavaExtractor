AWAKE

The moment you were born you believe life was a game created for your amusement.
One day it was not so funny and you begun to desperate.

*Solo: J.H.
*Solo: A.M.

Mistakes of life will make you hate all this world.
The world wants to change your ideas.
My heart is sick and shattered for your lies that make me hate your world.

*Solo: J.H.
*Solo: A.M.
