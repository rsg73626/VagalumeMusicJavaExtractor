GOING TO HELL

We live without knowing we´re alive
Against a fatal destiny.
You look for that sense that never existed.
You think you posses that power never have it.
It´s sense is hidden, this may no exist.
So what don´t, don´t care or do I?
Uncertain the future with traces, traces of past.
Don´t search anymore, it´s you, it´s you.

My life is going to hell
And never is eternal
My life is going to hell,
Don´t change your mind

The time is long, you can change your self.
My life is hate, this hate will kill you.
You look for a reason to be, to be strong.
You think you can win, this price never have it.
It´s hard to wake up, this way you can get it.
Come on don´t stop, don´t stop it is fine.
Uncertain the future with traces, traces of past.
Don´t search anymore, it´s you, it´s you.

My life is going to hell
And never is eternal
My life is going to hell,
Don´t change your mind
