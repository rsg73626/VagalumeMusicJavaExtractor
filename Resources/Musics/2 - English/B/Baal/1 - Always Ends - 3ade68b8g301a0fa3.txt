ALWAYS ENDS

His life disappeared without meaning
The things he did won´t go very far, and
I´m trying that those things won´t perish
Feeling that it will be useless.
I´ve seen his thoughts of sadness and I feel pain
They are solitude.
Love and anxiety
He wanted to scream but he couldn´t
And desire has vanished

*Solo: A.M.
*Solo: J.H.

Death is all I can see in his eyes of creation.
I try to understand why the good always ends

Hate I feel towards what destroys,
And laugh at what saddens me to breath the wind,
The sun and the stars and laugh at what saddens me

*Solo: J.H.
