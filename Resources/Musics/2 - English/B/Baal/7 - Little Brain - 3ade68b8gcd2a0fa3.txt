LITTLE BRAIN

Let´s go, give it a shot, you can´t even touch me
Let´s go touch it again, I want to laugh at you.
Let´s go, make see that you are a shit.
Yes, I know it, you´ll say I am wretch.
Every day you prove your little brain, like the ones at war.
Who do you think you are?
Come on, say it, you are all gods.
You couldn´t fall so deep because they don´t let you

Here I have the chance to laugh at you,
And I hope they beat you up.
You don´t even know on what political side you are.

And I hope that these words are useful for people
To know the shit you are and they spit your face when they see you.
I´m happy not to be like you.
So don´t get embarrased and if you really proud.
I laugh because you´re over.
Only the people from the past sustain you those still alive, and the new ones are known for their violent crimes.

Here I have the chance to laugh at you,
And I hope they beat you up.
You don´t even know on what political side you are.
