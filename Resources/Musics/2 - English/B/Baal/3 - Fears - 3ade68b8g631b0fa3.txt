FEARS

Walking between the shadows of an empty street
Without looking up to much
Feeling the cold breath of fears
and how it runs through your veins
The necessity of rest after accustom and boring reality

You would not like to remember
So intensely all you dreams,
hopes and faiths buried in earth.

A long time the worst of enemies
The worst of your victories
Your worst possible fear to assume
biggest that everything of part of the lie

You clearly see how a fragile
Life can calm dawn your soul
That needs the innocence of some one
Lower than you,
that fears the beast who retreats to its shed

Oh! Roaring with scorn before the panic of his eyes.
All his acts carry to the beast up the ladder.
