REMEMBERED

How do you want to be remembered?
For your honor or your pride?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your body or your mind?

Time is on my side
with every breath im alive
i realise money is worthless
With every dollar i earned yes ( yes)
-
I got a faith to burn i guess
this pretty faces living the fastest
A heartless soul is made out of plastic
I got no time for the past yet
I feel the minutes slip on by
I will sink with the steps out stride
and I
I fly close to sun
It’s why the
It’s why the good die young
I leave no song unsong

A heartless souls is big for given
The past is only gived to forgiven
The time is on my side
With every breath I m alive

How do you want to be remembered?
For your anger or your love?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your beauty or your blood?
Time, time goes tic, tic,tic
On by, Before you know is dear
Before you know youre love
they´re dying
Those sense thats slowing in to the past
High oh high and fast, I
I learned a simple lesson
be kind and count your blessings

A Real life is rat race
Id rather move at a snails pace
Id rather laught with a flat face
cause my best days, drifin by
from the suniest sky from the warm rays
Ima follow this road, until i find light
bright or small stay strong for the good fight
and time is on my side
with every breath im alive

Maybe you can close your eyes
and watch the movie of your life
or just stop and play along
Lets come play and ill start pray
and you are gone

How do you want to be remembered? ( from the begining just saying )
For your pasion or your faith?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your father or your name?

How do you want to be remembered?
For your actions or your words?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your silence or your voice?
