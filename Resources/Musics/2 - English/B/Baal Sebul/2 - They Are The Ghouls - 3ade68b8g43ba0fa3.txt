THEY ARE THE GHOULS

The owl, messenger of Uggi
Lords of death, those they are
They are the children, born of earth
That in the creation of Anu were spawned

They are the Ghouls
They are the Burning Pain

They ride over the mountain of sunset
And on the mountain of dawn they cry
Nowhere are they known, they have no name
Not in heaven, nor on earth

They are the Ghouls
They are the Burning Pain

We are the lost ones
From a time before time
From a land beyond the stars
From the age when Anu walked the earth
That they may watch the gate of Absu
The gate of Tiamat they watch
The gate of Kingu they oversee
The gate whose guardian is Iak Sakkak they bind

The owl, messenger of Uggi
Lords of death, those they are
They are the children, born of earth
That in the creation of Anu were spawned

They are the Ghouls
They are the Burning Pain
