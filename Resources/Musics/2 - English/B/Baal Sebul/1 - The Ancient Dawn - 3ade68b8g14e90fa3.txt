THE ANCIENT DAWN

Rise from the sea, hear me
Spirit of the seas, remember
In the names of the most secret spirits
I summon thee to mine aid

Gate of the sun
Open to me!
The ancient dawn
Ia sha Xul

Rise from the sea, hear me
Spirit of the seas, remember
In the names of the most secret spirits
I summon thee to mine aid

Gate of the sun
Open to me!
The ancient dawn
Ia sha Xul

...I am before Absu
I am before Nar Marratu
I am before Anu
I am before Kia..., ,,I am before all things!

...I am the ancient of days
I am before all things!
