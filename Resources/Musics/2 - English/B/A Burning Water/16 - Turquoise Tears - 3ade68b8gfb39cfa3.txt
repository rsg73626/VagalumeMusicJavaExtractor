TURQUOISE TEARS

Left over kindergarten scribble
stained upon my mind
my window sill sits wet with rain
from simple sighs like waving time
I've helped you here to sign your crimes
their words within this crippled line

I can't remain here today
these eyes of yours are traveling
you hand these stones a life away you speak
my heart in silhouette

here i trace alone
blinded by your thoughts
your whispering

I can't remain here today
these eyes of yours are traveling
you hand these stones a life away you speak
my heart in silhouette

and spiteful words are all I know
and as the tears flow dry
like the time that's passed me by
I wish for you to feel my pain
and as the imprints of your kiss still live with me
I dream of you
yes i dream of you
and as I hold my breath
and wish for you to see me here
and as I wait
wait for you to bury me beneath this floor
and as I sit
a ghost among the life I die...
