RETRACT

Rise when we fall
do we take
form in time
do we care
how we live
fold your side
where to speak
where to die
still in this war

set fire to it
there's so much more to this
but there's no truth only death
plot your vengeance now
forget our lives
so set fire to it

dream is this right
do we part
does this mean
false retract
hold your eyes
sample change
of our lives
reach the sky
drink our blood now

set fire to it
there's so much more to this
but there's no truth only death
plot your vengeance now
forget our lives
so set fire to it

their back from back
from the days of our lives
the decisions, decisions we make in death
remember the words
remember the words and speak truth
this sky inside from eyes
retract our souls and

set fire to it
there's so much more to this
but there's no truth only death
plot your vengeance now
forget our lives
so set fire to it.
