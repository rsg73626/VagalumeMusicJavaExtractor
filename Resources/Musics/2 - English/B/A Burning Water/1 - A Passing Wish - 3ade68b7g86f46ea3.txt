A PASSING WISH

The night is warn as I lie asleep
a life is lost when they broke in
and the air is cold and my skin is bare
the door swings open as i fight for life
my hands are locked and my eyes are blind
and this frigid air is losing me
and these concrete walls have it all locked in
and the time I count starts tonight

I am here holding
I am holding my hands to the sky
and wishing for the answers

and these bars are black and i can't see through
and this empty chair is my new friend
and you cast my eyes away from the day
these nights are dark yet blinding too
you say you wont I know you will
lock this door and lose the key
I sit as stone and wait the end
these cold dark night have me locked in

I am here holding
I am holding my hands to the sky
and wishing for the answers

to set me free
its so wrong its so right
but it'll set me free.
