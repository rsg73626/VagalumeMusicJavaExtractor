THESE RUINS

Under the amazing sun
the ingrown tone speaks
to cancel out the tears
but i remember well

of once remembered states of emptiness
the water is rising
in your eyes to bleed and see
these empty walls are forming the tides

inside the rediscovered sky
I only exist as the sun
in truth as the pages turn now

of once remembered states of emptiness
the water is rising
in your eyes to bleed and see
these empty walls are forming the tides

these words of yours they say to me
theres something more you want from me
this heart you break
this life you take
I'll be in end

and with raised fists
and oceans in our eyes
we fear our fears
we fear we once controlled the sky
we fear right to the end
this one time right to the end.
