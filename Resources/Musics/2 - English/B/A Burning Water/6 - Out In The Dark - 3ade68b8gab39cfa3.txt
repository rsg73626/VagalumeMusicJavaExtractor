OUT IN THE DARK

Lets fight the now
light that fire and burn it down
bring it down bring it down
we make our fate the time is now
all together all the same
its not over its not over
we're not the same off the shelf
its not over its not over
we're not the same..

HEY its not over now
we fight with all we have
our fates not up to you
its not over now
we're taking over
say it time and time again
we'll bring it down without the light
we'll play out in the dark
