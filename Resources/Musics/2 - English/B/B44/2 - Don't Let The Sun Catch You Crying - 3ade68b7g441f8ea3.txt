DON'T LET THE SUN CATCH YOU CRYING

Don't let the sun catch you crying 
The night's the time for all your tears, oh yeah 
Your heart may be broken tonight 
But tomorrow in the morning light 
Don't let the sun catch you crying 
No, no 

The nighttime shadows disappear, yeah 
And with all your tears, baby 
For the morning will bring joy 
For every girl and boy 
Don't let the sun catch you crying 
Ooh baby 

You know crying's not a bad thing 
But stop your crying when the birds sing 
Oh no, no, no 

Just don't forget that love's just a game 
And it can always come again 
So don't let the sun catch you crying 
Don't let the sun catch you crying, baby 

Tomorrow in the morning light 
Everything's gonna be alright
