GET DOWN

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
Let me take the time to understand 
And I will set your spirit free 

(( chorus )) 
If you get down on me 
I'll get down on you 
I will do anything 
That you want me to 
It's a game of give and take 
To make it through 
So if you get down on me 
I'll get down on you tonight 

Nighttime turns to day again (Woo) 
And you are on my mind 
Winter turns to Spring and then (Yea, yea, yea) 
Life has passed you by 
Right now we are so young and free 
But we're running out of time 
So while we've got each other here 
Let's treat our bodies right 

I wanna know exactly what to do 
So that you'll never get me off of your mind 
(So tell me what you're thinkin') 
Communicate, and I'll go under cover 
Gonna make you come tonight 
Over to my house 

(( chorus )) 

I'm not the type to change your mind 
If you wanna take it slow 
No pressure to go all the way 
There's other places we can go 

Anytime is the right to reveal it 
When two people fall as deep as you and me 
(So tell me what you're thinkin') 
I wanna know every inch of your body 
So I can set your spirit free 

(( chorus )) 

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're alseep at night 
If you open up to me 
I'll make you realize 
The things that you could never see 
Let me take the time to understand 
And I will set your spirit free 

(( chorus ))
