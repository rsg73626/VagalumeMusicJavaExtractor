HOW DID WE END UP HERE?

I let you go 
You did just the same 
We must have thought that we'd be 
Better off that way 
Now here we are 
Free to move on 
Searching just to find the love 
We both had all along 

After all the words were said now 
I'm thinking we should just be friends 

(( chorus )) 
How did we end up here? 
Didn't we say goodbye? 
I guess it took breakin' up 
To make us realize 
How did we end up here? 
I thought we couldn't work it out? 
It seems the circle of love 
Brought us back around 

We acted strong 
We thought we tried our best 
To save what we had 
By giving up on all the rest 
It all just seems so clear 
At least at the time 
Convincing ourselves 
We were just doing what was right 

After all those talks together 
Thought we gave up on forever 

(( chorus )) 

Sometimes the truest lies 
Are the ones we tell ourselves 
The very last time 
We said goodbye 
Inside we meant don't go 

(( chorus )) 

How did we end up here? 
How did we end up here? 
How did we end up here? 
Right back where we started? 

(( repeat till fade ))
