SMILE

Oh baby 
Ain't it like you to make me smile 
Pick me up when I'm feelin' down 
When no one else comes around 
Ain't it like you to make me smile 

Oh baby 
Ain't it like you to make me cry 
Every mile brings another tear 
Just wishin' you were here 
Ain't it like you to make me cry 

How many times have I 
Hung on the line 
Waitin' - for you to say the words 
(Just to say the words) 
To let me know that you're 
Needing me so 

Needing me so 
Hung on the line 
Waitin' - for you to say the words 
(Just to say the words) 
To let me know that you're 
To let me know that you're 

Oh baby 
Ain't it like you to make me smile 
Though I may not tell you enough 
When it all gets too much 

Ain't it like you to make me... 
Ain't it like you to make me... 
Ain't it like you to make me smile 
Smile 

You make me smile 
You make me smile 
You - make me smile 

You make me smile 
You make me smile 
You - make me cry 

(( repeat till fade ))
