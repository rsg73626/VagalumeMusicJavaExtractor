YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND

When you're down, and troubled 
And you need some love and care 
And nothing, nothing is going right 
Close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I will be there 
To brighten up 
Even your darkest night 
Oh yeah 

(( chorus )) 
You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am 
I'll come runnin' (Runnin') 
To see you again 
Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there 
You've got a friend 

If the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old 
North wind begins to blow 
Keep your head together, baby 
And call my name out loud 
Soon you'll hear me 
Knockin' at your door 

(( chorus )) 

Ain't it good to know that 
You have always got a friend in me? 
People can be so cold, oh yeah 
They'll hurt you 
And desert you, oh 
And take your soul if you let them 
But don't you let them 

(( chorus )) 

Anything you wanna do 
Be there if you need me to 
Anything you wanna do 
You've got a friend in me 

(( repeat till fade ))
