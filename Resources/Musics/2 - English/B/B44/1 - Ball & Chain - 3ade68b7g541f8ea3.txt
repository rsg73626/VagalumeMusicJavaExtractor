BALL & CHAIN

I just wanna be your ball and chain 
Wrapped around your finger 
Locked up, tie me down 
Follow you forever 
Never let you get away 
Holding on like a ball and chain 
(Boy, be my ball and chain 
Yo it's gotta be right) 

I never wanted to stay 
In one place too long 
On no, not me, I didn't want to be 
A victim of that fatal touch 
When you want someone too much - but 
You, you'll be the end of me 
And I don't want to run anymore 

(( chorus )) 
I just wanna be your ball and chain 
Wrapped around your finger 
Locked up, tie me down 
Follow you forever 
Never let you get away 
Holding on like a ball and chain 

I tried my best to avoid 
Making promises 
Oh no, not me, I didn't wanna 
Be a prisoner of that tender trap 
When there's no turning back - but 
You, you got me on my knees 
And I won't be afraid anymore 

(( chorus )) 

(( rap )) 
Uh, what... 
I know it's been some time 
Confine - to be alone 
But now I know I've found the one 
It's gotta be this love jones 
You know that I get open when you rub on my back 
The goosebumps and the chills must be proof of that 
'Cause I'm feelin' 
When you dealin' 
All the knowledge you've got 
About makin' it good 
When you're touchin' my spots 
I got - lots of luvin' when we bubblin' right 
I look forward to the time when the day turns night 
Yo I say meet at the crib at a quarter to nine 
And at that time what do I find? 
(And I won't be afraid anymore) 
The sight of you be wantin' me 
Just hauntin' my fight 
Boy, be my ball and chain 
Yo it's gotta be right 

I can't believe I'm holding on...
