THAT'S HOW I KNOW

My friends, ask me 
When it comes to givin' you my heart 
How can I be sure? 
'Cause they see, how fast we 
Filled up all the empty parts 
In my soul and yours 
When I answer it erases their doubts 
'Cause the truth comes out 

(( chorus )) 
When I'm miles away 
And I still fell your touch 
When I make mistakes 
And no one gives up 
When you're in my arms 
Baby you're still not close enough 
That's how I know it's love 

Just like they are 
I'm amazed I found someone 
Made just for me 
Ooh your love's so far 
Tell me I would be a fool 
Not to believe 
That I've been given a gift in this life 
I must have done something right 

(( chorus )) 

Now I know what forever's for 
Each day I want you more 

(( chorus )) 

That's how I know it's love..
