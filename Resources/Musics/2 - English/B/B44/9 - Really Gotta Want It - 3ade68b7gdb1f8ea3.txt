REALLY GOTTA WANT IT

The world is full of wannabe's 
They come and go like a summer breeze 
They want the money 
They want the fame 
But you know you gotta earn it each and every day 

If you can conceive it 
Then you can achieve it 
No one's gonna give it to you 
Go and get it! 

You really gotta want it 
You just gotta have it 
You gotta be committed 
You gotta live and breath it 
You really gotta mean it 
Never be defeated 
If you wanna reach your dream 
Ain't no room for in-between 
You really gotta want it 

They say stop, you say go 
You say yes when they say no 
when they laugh, make fun of you 
You just work harder 
You've got things to prove 

If you can believe it 
Then you can receive it 
Don't let nobody stand in your way 

The first at practice, the last to leave 
When others doubt, that's what I believe 
It's gonna take blood, sweat and tears 
Before you're gonna hear the crowd cheer 

You really gotta want it 
Just gotta have it 
You gotta be committed 
You gotta live and breath it 
You really gotta want it 
Just gotta have it 
You gotta be committed 
You gotta live and breath it 
No, no 
You really gotta mean it 
Never be defeated 
If you wanna reach your dream 
Ain't to room for in-between 
Oh no, no 
You really gotta want it
