ENDLESSLY

Late at night you call on the phone 
We'd talk about the day 
When you found out he was cheating 
You tell me that it hurts to the bone 
To trust someone that way 
To find that he was deceiving 

And I know I've always 
Just been a friend 
But if you look my way 
I'll make sure you never hurt again 

(( chorus )) 
Do you know I exist 
Just to promise you this 
Endlessly to be true to you 
And if you answer my prayer 
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear 
Endlessly to be true to you 
And if you'd only see 
How beautiful you and I would be 
Endlessly 

I remember when you fell in love 
I could not believe 
That it was not with me 
I sent a secret prayer up above 
And put my heart away 
So that you could be free 

And I know right now, 
You're broken in two 
But did you know my heart's been 
Broken since the day I met you 

Do you know I exist 
Just to promise you this 
Endlessly to be true to you 
And if you answer my prayer 
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear 
Endlessly to be true to you 
And in my sweetest dream 
You'd learn to put your faith in me 
Endlessly 

Sometimes the thing you need 
Is the one thing you can't see 
If you put your faith in me 
How beautiful you and I would be
