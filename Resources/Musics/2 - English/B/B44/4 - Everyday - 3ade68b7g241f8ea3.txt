EVERYDAY

Now that you're right in front of me 
There's something that I would 
Like to say to you 
I made up my mind 
And if you feel the same 
I swear that I will be there everyday 

(( chorus )) 
Everyday from now 
Until I die 
I will spend my life with you 
I can only pray 
That we'll stay the same 
Everyday 

Open your eyes and look at me 
(open your eyes and look at me) 
Tell me that you can see it too 
'Cause I'll be complete 
If you take this ring 
I swear that I will love you everyday 

(( chorus )) 

We both know this world 
Is always changin' 
No one stayin' together 
But maybe God will let us 
Last forever, and ever (ever) 
If I swear that I will be there everyday 
And I swear that I will love you everyday 

Spend my life 
I'll spend my life with you baby 
Until the day that I die 
I swear that I will love you everyday 

(( chorus 2x ))
