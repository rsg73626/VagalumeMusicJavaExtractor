GO GO

Jay! James! Roll tape I'm ready to roll! 

Here I am (It's...) 
It's Friday night (Ah...) 
I'm feelin' good (Good...) 
The time is right 
There you come (Right...) 
Out of the crowd 
And all that I can say is 

(( chorus )) 
I want, you to know 
That I can rock you you girl 
So come on lets go 
I want, you to see 
I'm really feelin' you 
So if you're feelin' me 
I want, you to know 
That I can rock you baby 
With the lights down low 
I want, you to see 
I'm really feelin' you so 
If you're feelin' me 
Go Go 

So you think you've got it all together 
Before you make a move and get too deep 
Don't you know that I can love her better? 
So give it up, go home 
And get some sleep 

(( chorus )) 

I must have been mistaken for another (Here I am...) 
You overlooked that fact that I'm your older brother (Friday night...) 
Don't you know the girl 
She wants me (Out of the crowd...) 
So look in the other direction 
And go and get some (Go, go, go...) 

(( chorus ))
