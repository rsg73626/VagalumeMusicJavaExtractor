MEMORY STAR

yeah, yeah 
Strophe: 
Give me a reason why you left to me 
And when I put my trust in you 
Hundred reason why didn’t puffer, yeah 
Took me under your wings and out of space 
But all I need it was your smile in face 

Refrain: 
Now you’re my memory star 
Show me in places it’s seem so far 
Keep in you’re distance 
Do you know 
Who you are 
you’re my memory star 

Na na na na na na..... 

Strophe: 
When I look into my eyes begin to cry 
Can you see my tears up in the sky 

Refrain 2x: 
Now you’re my memory star 
Show me in places it’s seem so far 
Keep in you’re distance 
Do you know 
Who you are 
you’re my memory star 

Strophe: 
You want to me expier 
You’re love is like is to me 
You told me how to dream, Oh 
You told me how can dreamed 
dreamed, dreamed,....... 

Refrain 2x: 
Now you’re my memory star 
Show me in places it’s seem so far 
Keep in you’re distance 
Do you know 
Who you are 
you’re my memory star 

Na na na na na ... 

Good bye my memory star
