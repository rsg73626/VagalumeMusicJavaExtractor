WHERE I'LL BE

Ooohhh yeah 
Come on come on 
Never gonna touch your body 
The way I used to 
Never gonna see you smile 
The way that I always do 
And when I’m gonna know 
That you’ll never forget about me 
History, memories, in your arms 
Where I’ll be 

Got a lot of feelings locked inside of me 
Wish you understood the pain you caused me 
Oooohhhhh 
You’re the only girl that I ever really wanted 
( You’re the only girl that I ever really wanted ) 
It’s killing me because you’re not even responding 
To me 
You’ve played these games before 

Never gonna touch your body 
The way I used to 
Never gonna see you smile 
The way that I always do 
And when I’m gonna know 
That you’ll never forget about me 
History, memories, in your arms 
Where I’ll be 

Baby it’s about that time for me to up and leave 
Ohhh yeeahhh 
I told you before but you wouldn’t pay attention to me 
No no 
If you just would’ve listened then maybe we could have worked things out 
Oh yeah 
But girl you didn’t 
Now I’m moving out 
You played these games before 

Never gonna touch your body 
The way I used to 
Never gonna see you smile 
The way that I always do 
And when I’m gonna know 
That you’ll never forget about me 
History, memories, in your arms 
Where I’ll be 

Where I’ll be 
Where I’ll be 

Three months have passed and I heard you want me back 
Ohh yeah 
I guess I was right when I said that you’d be back 
I heard your message on the answer machine last night 
Baby, come on 
Baby give up cause me and you just ain’t right 
You played those games before 

Never gonna touch your body 
The way I used to 
Never gonna see you smile 
The way that I always do 
And when I’m gonna know 
That you’ll never forget about me 
History, memories, in your arms 
Where I’ll be 

Never gonna touch your body 
The way I used to 
Never gonna see you smile 
The way that I always do 
And when I’m gonna know 
That you’ll never forget about me 
History, memories, in your arms 
Where I’ll be 

Never gonna touch your body 
The way I used to 
Never gonna see you smile 
The way that I always do 
And when I’m gonna know 
That you’ll never forget about me 
History, memories, in your arms 
Where I’ll be
