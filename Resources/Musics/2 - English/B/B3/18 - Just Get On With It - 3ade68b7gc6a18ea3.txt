JUST GET ON WITH IT

VERSE 1
What a night that we both had
All the moments that we shared
I’m about to go erratically crazy

Can’t believe that this is real
Can’t believe the way I feel
I’m fanatically attracted to you, Babe

BRIDGE 1
The mood is right by the fireside
You and me, yeah come on let’s ride
Do with me what you did that night
I love you madly

CHORUS 1
Just get on with it, Baby
Only you can save me
Yes, it’s true, I wanna be with you
I need you now, I need you daily

Just get on with it, Baby
Only you can save me
Yes, it’s true, wanna be saved by you
A night without you drives me crazy

VERSE 2
Only words cannot express
What it means when I confess
That I’m desperately wanting you so much

I will never make you cry
I will never say good-bye
I am physically addicted to your touch

BRIDGE 2
Come to me, I will do you right
I’m complete when you’re by my side
Let me know, tell me what you like
I want you badly

CHORUS 2

MIDDLE
I’d do anything just to have you close to me
It’s the way that you do what you do so slowly
Never thought something like this could happen to me
I’m completely into you - go on, do the things you do

HOOK
Just get on with it, just get on with it, just get on with it
Like you used to do and don’t make me wait
Just get on with it, just get on with it, just get on with it
Like you used to do, I love you so madly

CHORUS 3 / 4

CHORUS*
Yes, it’s true, I wanna be with you
I need you now, I need you daily
Yes it’s true, I wanna be with you
And you’re the only one who can save me
