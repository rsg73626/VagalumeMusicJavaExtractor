I NEED YOU

I need you, girl, 
I couldn’t live a day without you. 

Well, I tried to write a special song, 
a lovesong just for you 
to explain the way you make me feel inside 
so the meaning very simple 
and the word may not be lose, 
I couldn’t make it better if I tried 

Refrain: 
I need you, 
and I couldn’t live a day without you 
I need you, 
more than anyone could ever know 
I need you, 
and I wanna build my world around you 
I need you 
I need you 

Well, I sing the words and realised, 
that it all had been sad before, 
so I try to a different mind that meant so say, 
but I didn't had the feeling, 
and the first one said much more, 
so I guess I'll have to say once again, 

I need you, 
and I couldn’t live a day without you 
I need you, 
more than anyone could ever know 
(more than anyone could ever know) 
couldn’t live a day without you, girl 
I need you 
and I wanna build my world around you 
be there… 

I need you 
(Oh I need you) 
Baby 
(Couldn’t live a day without you) 
More than anyone could ever know 
(More than anyone could ever know) 



I couldn’t live a day without you, girl 
I need you 
and I wanna build my world around you 
I need you 

I need you 
(I need you) 
And I couldn’t live a day without you 
(I wanna) (Couldn’t live a day without you) 

I need you 
(Yeah, yeah) 
More than anyone could ever know 
(I need you, no no no) 
I need you 
(I need you) 
and I wanna build my world around you 
(I wanna)(couldn’t live a day without you) 
I need you 
(Yeah, yeah) 
I need you 

Well, I tried to write a special song, 
a lovesong just for you, 
I need you
