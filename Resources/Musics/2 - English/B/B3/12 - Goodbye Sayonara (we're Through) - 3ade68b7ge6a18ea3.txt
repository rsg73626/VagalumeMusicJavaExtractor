GOODBYE SAYONARA (WE'RE THROUGH)

You wind me up then you let me go 
You turn me on then you tell me no 
It’s hard to take what you do to me 
That ain’t the way love’s supposed to 

Well, right now - gotta tell me 
Right here - come, show me 
If you want me 
Well, tonight - is the time to 
Do it right - and show me 
That you need me 

Goodbye Sayonara, Ciao Girl 
Don’t want ya 
Thought I loved ya, don’t need ya. 
Goodbye Sayonara, Ciao Girl 
Don’t want ya 
Ain’t gonna find me waiting around for you anymore 
We’re through for sure 

You make me wait, keep me hangin’ ‘round 
You take me high then you bring me down 
You say you will then you say you won’t 
You say you do then you say you don’t 

Well, right now - gotta tell me 
Right here - come, show me 
If you want me 
Well, tonight - is the time to 
Do it right - and show me 
That you need me 

Goodbye Sayonara, Ciao Girl 
Don’t want ya 
Thought I loved ya, don’t need ya. 
Goodbye Sayonara, Ciao Girl 
Don’t want ya 
Ain’t gonna find me waiting around for you anymore 
We’re through for sure 

I’m tired of all these games 
I’m tired of all these fights 
I’m tired of being restless 
I can’t sleep at night 
These games you put me through 
Ain’t gonna work on me anymore
