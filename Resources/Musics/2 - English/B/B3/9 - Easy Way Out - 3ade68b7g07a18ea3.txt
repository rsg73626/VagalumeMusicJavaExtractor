EASY WAY OUT

See you can’t remember what I can’t forget
All the things we had together
Keep your picture baby, to remind me of
When you said we’d be forever

I don’t care who’s wrong or right
Can we give it one more try
I just need you here tonight

We’re like fire, water, sun and the rain
When we touch each other it’s pleasure and pain
If there’s something missing, there’s something to gain
That’s what love’s all about, baby don’t take
The easy way out

Tell me what you’re missing
Where it all went wrong
Let’s go back to where we started
Back to where we started girl
Give me one good reason why we shouldn’t try
Don’t wanna leave this broken heart

I don’t care who’s wrong or right
Can we give it one more try
I just need you here tonight

We’re like fire, water, sun and the rain
When we touch each other it’s pleasure and pain
If there’s something missing, there’s something to gain
That’s what love’s all about, baby don’t take
The easy way out

When I try to get close, you push me away
As if you’d rather be taken the easy way out
I can live through the pain, but I can’t live without you

We’re like fire, water, sun and the rain
When we touch each other it’s pleasure and pain
If there’s something missing, there’s something to gain
That’s what love’s all about, baby don’t take
The easy way out
