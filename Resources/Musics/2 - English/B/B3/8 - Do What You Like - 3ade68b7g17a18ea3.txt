DO WHAT YOU LIKE

Clubs are hoppin’
People dancin’
And my boys are screaming
Cause we’re here to have a good time

Now I think I know
Where you and I can go
Just follow me let’s roll
Come on baby

I know that tonight
We came to party
So leave your troubles behind
Get on the dancefloor

Put your hands up in the air
It’s Friday night and you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like
Put your hands up in the air
Shake em around like you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like

Now on the dancefloor
I’m gonna get mine so you better get your’s
I see you across the floor
Shakin’ your body
Now is this you and me
That’s the way it’s gotta be
So come along with me
Come on baby

I know that tonight
We came to party
So leave your troubles behind
Get on the dancefloor

Put your hands up in the air
It’s Friday night and you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like
Put your hands up in the air
Shake em around like you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like

Do what you like
Can make it right
Gonna make tonight
Last forever
Do what you like
Can make it right
Gonna make tonight
Last forever

Put your hands up in the air
It’s Friday night and you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like
Put your hands up in the air
Shake em around like you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like

Put your hands up in the air
It’s Friday night and you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like
Put your hands up in the air
Shake em around like you just don’t care
You can do what you wanna do
Do what you like
