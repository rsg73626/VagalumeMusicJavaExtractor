TONIGHT AND FOREVER

Another night, another day,
Your heart is still so far away
And I want you girl,
I need your love.

I never felt this way before
And now I know that I am sure
That I love you girl
Forever

I wanna be right by your side
I wanna be the only one
Can I hold you tonight and forever
Baby

It doesn't matter where you are
We will never be apart
I'll be there
Tonight and forever

It doesn't matter where you stay
I will hold you anyway
I'll be there
Tonight and forever

Tonight and forever

And everytime that you are near
My love is waiting oh so clear
And I'm trembling
Like a child

So hold me now
Don't get me wrong
I do believe that we belong together

Tonight and forever

I wanna be right by your side
I wanna be the only one
Can I hold you tonight and forever


It doesn't matter where you are
We will never be apart
I'll be there
Tonight and forever

It doesn't matter where you stay
I will hold you anyway
I'll be there
Tonight and forever

I should have told you
But I didn't know how
Wish I was holding you now

Tonight and Forever

Where you are
Where you are
Doesn't matter
We won't be apart

Tonight and Forever

It doesn't matter where you are
We will never be apart
IÂ°ll be there
Tonight and Forever

It doesn't matter where you stay
I will hold you anyway
In my heart
Tonight and Forever

Tonight and Forever

Tonight and Forever
