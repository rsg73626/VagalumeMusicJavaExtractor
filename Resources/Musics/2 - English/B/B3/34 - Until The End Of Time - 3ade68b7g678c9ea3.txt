UNTIL THE END OF TIME

I've been waiting for a lifetime 
For someone just like you 
Always tried to find a reason 
Why's that everything you do 
Makes me feel this way, keeps me so strong 
Thought I never would surrender 
Till the day you came along 

CHOROUS 
After all that we've been through 
I can't stop loving you 
I don't know what I should do 
(Girl,) I can't go on without you 
No more promises, no need for lies or tears to cry 
Stay with me forever 
Until the end of time 

I've been trying to find the answers 
To the words you've never said 
And I wonder how we've made it 
To find real love instead 
I won't let you go, whatever will be 
You're all I ever wanted, you're the only one for me 

CHOROUS
