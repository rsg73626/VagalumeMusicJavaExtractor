GO AWAY

I’m so tired of playing these games
What you say is never the same
One day you’re lovin’ me
The next day you’re gone
How should I handel this
You stole my heart with just one kiss
Now you’re ignorin’ me
And you’re doing me wrong

Everytime you shut me out it’s harder to take
I gotta stop this now before my heart starts to break
You think what you’re telling me is oh so true
But sometimes I still think I’m the man for you.

Go Away, that’s not what you said yesterday
Please leave, don’t stay
Why are you telling me these words today.

We tried to talk last night
But it ended up in a fight
You left me so confused
‘Cause I thought things were cool
I thought I was the one for you
But there’s something else your going through
So tell me what you wanna do
Before we move on

Everytime you shut me out it’s harder to take
I gotta stop this now before my heart starts to break
You think what you’re telling me is oh so true
But sometimes I still think I’m the man for you.

Go Away, that’s not what you said yesterday
Please leave, don’t stay
Why are you telling me these words today.

I don’t know what to say
Should I leave or should I stay
I don’t know what to do or why
I keep falling for you…
