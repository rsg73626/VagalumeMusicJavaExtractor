WAS IT EVER YOU

There’s a part every thought
Every shadow through my heart
There are hours of the dark
I just wonder where you are
All the things we did and said
All that we wanted,
All that we still might want

Though I never knew, was it ever you
Just some feeling in me, just some dream of you
I never knew I just wanted you
Just you being with me, me forever with you

There’s a part of all the talk
All the wanting to get on
Every solitary walk
All of it’s all there, all that I know and want

Though I never knew, was it ever you
Just some feeling in me, just some dream of you
I never knew I just wanted you
Just you being with me, me forever with you

Every evening knows your gone
I walk alone and all I’ve got’s this song

Though I never knew, was it ever you
Just some feeling in me, just some dream of you
I never knew I just wanted you
Just you being with me, me forever with you
