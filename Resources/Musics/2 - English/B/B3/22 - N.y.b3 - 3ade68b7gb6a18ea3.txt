N.Y.B3

I’m on the train to west side
Anticipating tonight
Get off of the nine, head down the street
I’m movin’ to my cities beat

There ain’t no feelin’ like it
You know you can’t deny it
Don’t even try to fight it – N.Y.C.
Just let the beat control ya
And let the music show ya
That New York City is place to be

New York
The streets, the lights, the sounds
New York
My peoples in this town
New York
Just come along and see
New York
The city that never sleeps

Skyscrapers fill the air
Neon lights bighten Times Square
Uptown, Downtown, this cities got
Me goin’ round and round

There ain’t no feelin’ like it
You know you can’t deny it
Don’t even try to fight it – N.Y.C.
Just let the beat control ya
And let the music show ya
That New York City is place to be

New York
The streets, the lights, the sounds
New York
My peoples in this town
New York
Just come along and see
New York
The city that never sleeps
