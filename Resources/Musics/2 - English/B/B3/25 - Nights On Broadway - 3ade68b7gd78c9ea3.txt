NIGHTS ON BROADWAY

Here we are in the room full of strangers, 
Standing in the dark where your eyes couldn't see me 

Well, I have to follow you 
Though you didn't want me to. 
But that won't stop my lovin' you 
I can't stay away 

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway 
Singin' them love songs, 
Singin' them straight to the heart songs. 
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway 
Singin' them sweet sounds 
To that crazy, crazy town. 

Now in my place 
There are so many others 
Standin' in the line; 
How long will they stand between us? 

Well, I have to follow you 
Though you didn't want me to. 
But that won't stop my lovin' you 
I can't stay away 

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway 
Singin' them love songs, 
Singin' them straight to the heart songs. 
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway 
Singin' them sweet sounds 
To that crazy, crazy town. 

I will wait, 
even if it takes forever; 
I will wait, 
even if it takes a life time. 
Somehow I feel inside 
You never ever left my side. 
Make it like it was before 
Even if it takes a life time, takes a life time. 

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway 
Singin' them love songs, 
Singin' them straight to the heart songs. 
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway 
Singin' them sweet sounds 
To that crazy, crazy town.
