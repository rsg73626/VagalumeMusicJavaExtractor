I SWEAR

swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side 

I see the questions in your eyes 
I know what's weighting on your mind 
But you can be sure I know my part 
Cause I'll stand beside you through the years 
You'll only cry those happy tears 
And though I'll make mistakes 
I'll never break your heart 

I swear 
By the moon and stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear 
Like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 
For better or worse 
Till death do us part 
I'll love you with every beat of my heart 
And I swear 

I'll give you everything I can 
I'll build your dreams with these two hands 
We'll hang some memories on the wall 
And when there's silver in your hair 
You won't have to ask if I still care 
Cause as time turns the page 
My love won't age at all 

I swear 
By the moon and stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear 
Like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 
For better or worse 
Till death do us part 
I'll love you with every single beat of my heart 
I swear 

I swear 
By the moon and stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear 
Like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 
For better or worse 
Till death do us part 
I'll love you with every single beat of my heart 
I swear 
I swear
