SO IN LOVE WITH YOU

Verse 1 
Am I crazy now? 
uh I dream too much 
But when I think of you 
I just wanna to feel your touch 

whisper in your ear 
The Things you love to hear 
Do you love me too? 
I’m so happy that you do 

Every little thing you have said and done 
it’s in my heart 

I’m so in love 

Refrain 
I'm so in love with you 
You gotta tell me what to do 
Uh babe 
I’m so in love with you 

I'm so in love with you 
I really don’t know what to do 
Uh babe 
I’m so in love with you 

Verse 2 
Now I understand 
How lonely live can be 
when no one’s by my side 
who can set my spirit free 

u take me by surprise 
when you looking in my eyes 
my friends are telling me 
that something has come over me 

Every little thing you have said and done 
it’s in my heart 

Refrain 
I'm so in love with you 
You gotta tell me what to do 
Uh babe 
I’m so in love with you 

I'm so in love with you 
I really don’t know what to do 
Uh babe 
I’m so in love with you 

Bridge 

Girl I really hope you understand 
Right From the first day when you took my hand 
then I know that you are made for me 
I’m so in love.. 

Refrain 
I'm so in love with you 
You gotta tell me what to do 
Uh babe 
I’m so in love with you 

I'm so in love with you 
I really don’t know what to do 
Uh babe 
I’m so in love with you
