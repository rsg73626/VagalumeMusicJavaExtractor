WE GOT THE POWER

Stop for a moment 
Here's a message to you 
It's a call to us all and 
The things we must do 

Got the cause for our vision 
Got the force on our side 
When the sky is the limit 
When we go for the ride 

Prechorus: 
Nothing can stop us 
When we stand as one 
When we come together 
And we take on 
We got it, we got it, we got it now 

Chorus: 
We got the power 
Get ready to go 
We stand united 
The energy flows 
We got the power 
The moment has come 
Nothing can stop us 
When we stand as one 

Stop let me tell you 
Got to get back on track 
It's a call to us all 
And there's no turning back 

I don't care what you've been doing 
I don't care where you belong 
From now on we're together 
Cause together we're strong 

Prechorus 
Chorus (2x) 

We got the power 
Get ready to go 
We stand united 
The energy flows 
We got the power 
The moment has come 
Nothing can stop us 
We got it, we got it, we got it now 

Chorus 

We got the power 
Get ready to go 
We stand united 
The energy flows 
We got the power
