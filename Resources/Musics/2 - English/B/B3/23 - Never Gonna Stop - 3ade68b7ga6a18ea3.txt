NEVER GONNA STOP

Verse 1
U see us busting up the floor
Well if you’re not impressed - then what cha’ lookin’ at
Yeah i know – we’re gonna do it ‘til we drop
We’re always doin’ it to the max – and we’re never gonna stop

Pre chorus
I feel so alive
Can u feel it – here it comes again

Chorus
We can do it at the party - we can do it in the club
Never gonna stop
We can do it together – we can do it alone
Never gonna stop
We can do it all night – and we can do it all day
Never gonna stop
That’s the way it is – and that’s the way we play
And we’re never gonna stop

Verse 2
The baseline’s shooting up your spine
And the beat – calls your name – what ‘cha gonna do
That’s right – just get that booty on the floor
You got to dance ‘til you drop – ‘til you can’t dance no more

Pre chorus
I feel so alive
Only the music – can take me so high – high – high – high

Chorus
We can do it at the party - we can do it in the club
Never gonna stop……………….

Rap or instrumental

Chorus
We can do it at the party - we can do it in the club
Never gonna stop……………….
