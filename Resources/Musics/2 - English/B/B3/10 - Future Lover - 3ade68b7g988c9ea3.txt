FUTURE LOVER

Every night I fall asleep 
I say goodnight to the one I'll meet 
Knowing one day fate will find you 
And lead us home to sulitude 
The wind blows... the time grows... 

CHORUS 
This is to my future lover, wherever you may be 
are you hiding in the moonlight 
The same casts over me 
This is to my future lover 
When will we meet 
But it can't be that easy wont you come to me 

I wake and blow a kiss into the wind 
I hope it grows wings and lands under your skin 
We'll bruise each other badly 
Feel pain deep in our hearts 
But soul mates are forever and we're never gonna fall apart 
The wind blows... the time still grows... 

CHORUS 

Give me a sign (sign) 
I know you're mine 
Come be my saving grace (wont you find me) 
Give me a sign, give me a sign 
I know you're mine (mine) 
Come be my saving grace... (yeah) 

CHORUS 

But it can't be that easy 
Dream a dream of me... 
yeaha
