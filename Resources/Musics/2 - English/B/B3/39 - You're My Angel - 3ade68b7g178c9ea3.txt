YOU'RE MY ANGEL

You're the air, babe, that I breathe,
you're the strength that I always need,
You're the light in my eyes, my shining star
You guide me the way
You have to promise me that you will stay
Always and forever just you and I

Angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel baby, all right
Angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel baby

Girl, you know that, trust me
I'll be right here and you can count on me
With a hand to hold and with open arms
Every day and every night
I will always be your guiding light
Always and forever just you and me

Angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel baby, all right
Angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
Yes you are

You'll be the one
The one that I need
And you are my angel
My guiding light

Angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel baby, all right
Angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
Yes you are
