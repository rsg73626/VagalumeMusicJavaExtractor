RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME

You're in the right place and at the right time, let's get it on
You're with the right man and you're the right girl, this can't be wrong

You've been searching for a long time
And I've been looking at you all night
Why do you hide behind that sweet smile
Step over here girl and let's talk for a while

So if you want to be with me
Just come up close
And I'll make you see

CHORUS:
You're in the right place and at the right time
Let's get it on (tonight, tonight)
I'll show you how it's done
You're with right man and you're the right girl
This can't be wrong (tonight)
You're in the right place, the right time

Why can't I seem to take my eyes of you
I can't resist the way your body moves
So if you tell me what you want from me
I'll try to satisfy your every need

So if you want to be with me
There's nothing wrong it's destiny

CHORUS

Let's get it on, can we get it on
You and I were ment to be dancing this seductively
Your body right up close to me
Forever and ever

CHORUS
