ANGEL IN MY BED

You came into my life
Like an angel - looking for something new
You said hello and then
Something happened - a whole different avenue
I took you in my arms
And it felt good
Just supernatural

Let’s guess what love is all about
Oh babe just come down off your cloud
And maybe i will realize
That you’re a devil in disguise

So let me feel
That heaven’s all that real
And make me break the seal
Just be that angel in my bed – baby
Spread your wings
Let’s do some special things
You’re all i’ve never had
You’re that angel in my bed –baby

The way you’re kissing me
Makes me wonder if it’s reality
The way you change my dreams
Makes me hope that you’ll stay forever

Let’s guess what love is all about
Oh babe just come down off your cloud
And maybe i will realize
That you’re a devil in disguise

So let me feel
That heaven’s all that real
And make me break the seal
Just be that angel in my bed – baby
Spread your wings
Let’s do some special things
You’re all i’ve never had
You’re that angel in my bed –baby

I know you’ll fly away
No chance to stop you
Cos angels never stay
They leave you
When you fall in love

Oh let me feel
That heaven’s all that real
And make me break the seal
Just be that angel in my bed – baby
Spread your wings
Let’s do some special things
You’re all i’ve never had
You’re that angel in my bed –baby
