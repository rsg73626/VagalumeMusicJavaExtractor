STEP IN THE SQUARE

Come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done
Dunn come get it son, whassup little one
Come step in the square right here to get done
Dunn, come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done
Dunn, come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done

[B Stone]
After we shake hands, we're no longer friends
From the time the bell ring, until the round ends
I'm wanna move up, from amateur to pro
Golden Gloves at the Garden just to let you know
Straight from Do or Die, represent Bed-Stuy
There's no lookin back with no reason why
I should lose, in gyms I paid dues
with the counter-attack, closed fist, I'm in the combat
Stick and step, yo, ruin your rep
Watch how you step, yo, you shouldn't slept
Press your luck don't duck feel the uppercut
with the right hand sting, helpin me cut off the ring
On the ropes, knocked down for the eight count
You survived the round, this ain't the end of the bout
I'm in the corner the trainer got me pissed
Tellin me I'm gonna lose, destroy my every wish
Suck it up, it's all in my gut
It's my time to shine, I'm about to kick butt
Ding ding, I'm back in the ring
The crowd's goin wild, over my one-two swing
Left to right, then, right to left
My intent's to move strong, to show you who's best
Number one contender that's ready to rain
on ALL the competition that's tryin to bring me pain

Come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done
Dunn, come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done
Dunn, come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done
Dunn, come get it son, whassup little one
Yo step in the square right here to get done

Come get it
