LETTER TO MY BROTHER

Hey ya
Used to be my brother
No matter the weather
Noo (no ah ah)
You and I ty oh

We know say khaki no be leather
That one no mean say we no fit love each other
Stick together like bread and butter
Forget about the past
Now the future really matter
Oh yes, my brother
No one else, no other
I tell the truth, this is straight from the roots
Change your ways, I no dey beef you
My brother, I dey wish make you prosper
Live long like a rasta
Become a superstar
But yet

If you no send me o
People plenty wey send me o
I am not alone
I'm faze alone
My brother, say, jah is here with me o
Egba mi o
Kini mo se ti o dara o
I've done nothing wrong
I dey speak my mind

My brother
E no be crime to say what you want to say
And you can do what you want to do
Only heaven knows that I love you
But my brother, you need to change your attitude
I know say you no send me but I send you
Heaven knows that I have nothing against you
But if na little bit change
Make we dey straight
From the past and throw the ash away

See, I dey pray for you brother
Make you prosper too, brother
Make you wish me the same thing too, brother
Blessings for your brother
Blessings for your sister
Blessings for your family too, brother
Me and you we no be ota
E go better make we throw way the past inside gutter
Leave am waka
If I pour you holy water, make you pour me holy water back

See, I dey pray for you brother
Make you wish me the same thing too, brother
Me and you we no be ota
E go better make we throw way the past inside gutter
Leave am waka
If I pour you holy water, make you pour me holy water back

Say what you want to say
You can do what you want to do
Only heaven knows that I love you
But my brother, you need to change your attitude
I know say you no send me, but I send you
Heaven knows that I have nothing against you
But if na little bit change
Make we dey straight
Fom the past and throw the ash away
