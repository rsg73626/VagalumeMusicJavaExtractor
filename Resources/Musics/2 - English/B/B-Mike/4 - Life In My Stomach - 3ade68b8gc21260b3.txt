LIFE IN MY STOMACH

I need you to listen
Think, before you make that decision

You see I once knew a girl
Perfect as all hell
Happy and all swell, 'till the day that it all fell
But, you see one day her friends had asked her to come with them
A party filled with drinking and everything except wisdom, but listen
You see she said "nope, I need to study, "
But her friends were like "c'mon just have a night with all your buddies
It's totally a saturday so come with everybody
All the alcohol you want and every guy there is a hottie. "
"Alright" was her response, 'till not after very long it was drinks and puffing bongs
Until she is barely conscious
She meets a guy who keeps winking with his eye
Wants to get between her thighs
But it's clear he has no conscience
But soon they start kissing, and they don't have a rubber
She tells him "no stop it, " he says "chill, I got it covered. "
A couple weeks later every morning felt like death
And at the doc's it's positive up on the pregnancy test
She said

I feel you kicking, little angel
Don't worry 'bout the sorrow
Cause mummy's gonna be right here until you see tomorrow
I feel your life in my stomach
I promise I'll protect it cause nobody comes above it
And though your daddy wants to take your life away
You should know I'll never let him, cause I tell him everyday
"You see this life in my stomach, regardless if you help me as a father
I'mma love it. "

She's been thinking for a while with these thoughts in her head
Feeling nervous, is it worth it? Should I press the eject?
It was perfect, now I'm worthless
I'm just feeling upset
Is it right to take a life, or something I will regret?
She tells her mother "I'm a wreck, and I'm a pregnant adolescent. "
Her mother says "how could you never think to use protection?
It's practical to see you need to actually believe
Your actions could be worse like contracting a disease. "
The tears keep on falling, thinking 'what do I say? '
Then her mother holds her closely, tells her "it will be okay
But you need to think quickly about making a decision
Do you want to be a mother or go through with the incision? "
She said "you won't believe it, this baby I'mma keep it
But promise for the moment we can keep it a big secret. "
Her mother leans forward, kissed her on the head
And then they looked down at her tummy, here's the words that she said

I feel you kicking, little angel
Don't worry 'bout the sorrow
Cause mummy's gonna be right here until you see tomorrow
I feel your life in my stomach
I promise I'll protect it cause nobody comes above it
And though your daddy wants to take your life away
You should know I'll never let him, cause I tell him everyday
"You see this life in my stomach, regardless if you help me as a father
I'mma love it. "

It's 8 months later, a knock is at the door
It's the father of her child and he's looking so unsure
She's taking him to court cause he refuses child support
Then he says to her "you need to give this baby an abort. "
You see he's got a girlfriend and he's clear that she said
'If he's gonna be a father then it's over instead. '
But you see it's way too late because she's two weeks from the cradle
He said he hates her child, and then she pushed him in the table
He looks at her and says to her
"Oh, now you've really done it! "
Kicks her in the stomach, on the floor she plummets
The feeling is so sickening, tears start kicking in
Looks below her stomach, sees the blood start trickling
Crawling to the phone, he's angry looking savage
The blood is dripping out, something like a miscarriage
Pulls her by her hair, she can barely defend
Says "good bye little kiddie. "
Then he kicks her again!

I feel you kicking, little angel
Don't worry 'bout the sorrow
Cause mummy's gonna be right here until you see tomorrow
I feel your life in my stomach
I promise I'll protect it cause nobody comes above it
And though your daddy wants to take your life away
You should know I'll never let him, cause I tell him everyday
"You see this life in my stomach, regardless if you help me as a father
I'mma love it. "
