DEAR DAD

Haha
You know it's really quite funny
I used to look up to you
You were my fuckin' idol
But the truth always comes out
I don't even know what to call you anymore
Dad, father
Oh wait but this one's my favourite
Lying ass mother fucker!

Don't you ever (don't you ever)
Come near me (come near me)
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
I will kill you (I will kill you)
Cause you're dead as a dad to me
And don't ever (and don't ever)
Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

Yo
Let's fuckin' picture it, shit's about to blast the fan
I was only eight when mamma had to move to Amsterdam
And you approached her as a married man
So leave it up to me I'll cut your head off like the Taliban in Pakistan
I can't believe it, you're out here making stacks of cheese
And while I'm stuck here struggling I should make your ass a paraplegic
It's sad to see it, but dad you cheated
I swear to God if you come near me you'll get stomped on with my black Adidas'
You had me fooled for all those years with your lies
But now I see it's cause of you for all the tears in my eyes
And to my mother I apologise sincerely cause I
Was always blinded by betrayal that had appeared in disguise
Dad, it's so ridiculous, feeling silly I hit you up
For thinking you were really a parent it makes me sick as fuck
And don't be thinking that where I'm at is because of you
My fist is where your head will have a one way ticket to

Don't you ever (don't you ever)
Come near me (come near me)
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
I will kill you (I will kill you)
Cause you're dead as a dad to me
And don't ever (and don't ever)
Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

(What up dad?) Do you remember the birthdays you missed out?
(What up dad?) Do you remember breaking into our house?
(What up dad?) Do you remember buying food for yourself?
I was like six without a clue or a doubt, come on now tell me (what up dad?)
I wanna rip you up, no don't just think that's figurative
Living up in your villa while we suffered you told fibs to us
My bottom lip is up but don't assume that means we will forget what you just did to us
You're finished pops
Let it be told, the story how you chilled in mansions with gold
While we nearly got evicted to be ditched in the cold
Don't be tryin' to explain to us, the fact is you did it
The only time I put my hand to you is to smack you with it
And don't go saying that you're something that my step-dad will never be
He cherished me
Your psychopathic ass belongs in therapy
Or maybe I do, cause wanna know what I'd do?
I'd fuckin' severe your cerebrum singing la dee da doo
And don't you ever

Don't you ever (don't you ever)
Come near me (come near me)
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
I will kill you (I will kill you)
Cause you're dead as a dad to me
And don't ever (and don't ever)
Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

I can't believe this man
You were my fuckin' hero
Every time my mum tried to tell me the truth I was right there defending you
You ain't even call me on my birthday
And now I hear you put a price on my mother's head?
Fuck that - and fuck you too!
Cause since you took away my trust fund I'm stuck paying an interest on my student loan
So stay the fuck away from me
And don't you ever

Don't you ever (don't you ever)
Come near me (come near me)
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
I will kill you (I will kill you)
Cause you're dead as a dad to me
And don't ever (and don't ever)
Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

Don't you ever
Come near me
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise
I will kill you
Cause you're dead as a dad to me
