BABY DON'T CUT

She's only 17 her whole life's ahead of her
She hates school because the people
they discredit her
Her boyfriend tries to show her
that's not how it seems
But everyday she just gets
lowered by her self esteem
He tries to tell her every night
will have a brighter day
She even tried to over dose
and take her life away
She's feeling hopeless there
sitting down beside her bed
Then he takes his hand and places
it beside her head
He tries to hold her close
but with every touch she still resists
Then he sees the scars that
burry deep within her wrists
She's feeling numb, he starts to beg
and plead and ask her why
She says this way I have control
of the pain she feels inside
He's asking her how long it's
been since you've felt this way
Because you got me
and I'm feeling so damn helpless
She says its been a while
I guess I needed better luck
Then he screams at her
and tells her Baby never cut!

Nobody seems to get you
you think you're on your own
Well listen pretty lady
you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything
just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting
you think the road has end
You may just feel the bade your holding
is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything
just promise baby you won't cut

The next day she's feeling better
than the day before
Even cracked a couple smiles
as she walked the corridor
But all that seemed to end she dropped her
books as she went into class
And every student in he room
just seemed to point and laugh
She couldn't take it anymore
she sent her boy a text
It said I love you with my body
soul and heart to death
Te thought nothing typed
I love you then he sent it
By death he didn't
know that she had literally just meant it
She ducked the next class ran
straight into the bathroom
Thought to her self she
wouldn't brake her promise that soon
1 cut... 2 cuts... 3 cuts... 4
The blood just started dripping
from the tub to the floor
Her boyfriend had a feeling in
his stomach that he hated
Followed it and ran down to
her house he never waited
The front door was open
he heard the water running
He stormed into the bathroom
and his heart just started gunning

Nobody seems to get you
you think you're on your own
Well listen pretty lady
you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything
just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting
you think the road has end
You may just feel the bade your holding
is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything
just promise baby you won't cut

He put her arm around his shoulder
he's just tranna lean her back up
Yelling out her name as he lays
her beside the bathtub
He feels his whole world
just got hit from an avalanche
Screaming out so heavily
somebody call an ambulance
Felling mad angry like
somebody led her on to this
Her eyeballs are rolling
drifting out of consciousness
Thinking to himself why the hell
didn't she just stop at will
The tears just keep on Rolling
as they head to the hospital
Paramedics rush her in
the doctor calls emergency
She's lost a lot of blood the place
looking like a murder scene
An hour later, the doc walks in with a sour face
And says excuse me for the words
that I'm about to say
I'm sorry for your loss, the boy
just starts collapsing
His own world
his own girl just took a crashing
Saying to himself that it's his
fault and that he let it up
But baby... I thought you promised
you would never cut

Nobody seems to get you
you think you're on your own
Well listen pretty lady
you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut
baby don't cut
You can do anything
just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting
you think the road has end
You may just feel the bade your
holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything
just promise baby you won't cut
