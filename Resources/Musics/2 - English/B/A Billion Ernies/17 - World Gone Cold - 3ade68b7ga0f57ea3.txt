WORLD GONE COLD

watching from the rock of 
life where I can see the world afar it’s all burnt up from the Devil’s evil charm the world needed help God knows who to send He sends his only son you better get ready for the end why are you running from the God of Light can’t you see the streets of gold or is your heart froze up frozen up it’s just too cold only one man can warm it up take his cup drink it up He is coming coming from above coming if you are ready or not every tongue confess that Jesus is the risen one perfect in every manner bright white the lamb of God He’s got all the answers are your eyes set for Zion
