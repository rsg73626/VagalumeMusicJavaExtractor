PERSECUTION

Good husband, friend, and dad.
He had a lot worth living for.
He had flaws, he made mistakes
Just like anyone.

Good to those who think like them
They never meant to hurt
Condescending attitudes
They think God only loves them

He will always walk in the dark
Because that?s all he knows
They will always judge everyone
Because that?s all they know

In his mind he is resolved,
Put your thoughts back on the shelf
There is no changing him now
There is no love in him now

In their minds they ?plant the seed?
They think they did their job.
There is no changing him now.
There is no love in him now.

?Do You Know What it?s Like to Sleep Forever??
What if they taught about  love?
He could have lived forever.
?Do You Know What It?s Like  to Sleep Forever??

He never got the chance, 
And he never will.
