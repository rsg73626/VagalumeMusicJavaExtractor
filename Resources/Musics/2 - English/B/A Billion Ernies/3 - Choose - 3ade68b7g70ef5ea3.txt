When there’s no one there to talk to 
no one to be your friend 
turn your eyes upon Jesus 
just throw him a line 
it doesn’t matter when 
He loves it when you pray 
He loves the things you say 
step up to the microphone 
say what you have to say 
another poor man crying asking God for help again 
you don’t see him crying anymore 
He trusted God all the way with Jesus 
His best friend put your life with God completely 
so when you die you have a home 
this life down here is nothing 
You get to choose your fate for eternity on one hand 
you have the Devil clever as can be 
He’ll pull you down, 
he’ll throw you around and when he’s done with you, 
you’re as dead as can be 
trust me 
choose the high road 
you can live in peace for eternity 
you won’t be crying anymore 
when I look to heaven, it brings out the best in me 
if you want what I have FOLLOW ME 
so when there’s no one there to talk to 
no one to be your friend 
will you then ask God for something 
it’s time to choose your fate, fire or gold
