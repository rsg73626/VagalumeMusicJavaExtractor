STARCIA HATES HER JOB

My life is so busy And somehow 
I always end up feeling idle
The more I think of what I am supposed to do,
The more confused messed up I feel

I get up everyday and go to my nine-to-five
When my day is done, and my work is almost through
I find myself still searching  for something new.
I can?t remember what it  feels to be alive

You guide me with a spotilight
You show me the path and  where I should be going
But instead of following it I  pull and drag
It right behind me where I  want to go.
My life?s not justified unless you?re glorified.
