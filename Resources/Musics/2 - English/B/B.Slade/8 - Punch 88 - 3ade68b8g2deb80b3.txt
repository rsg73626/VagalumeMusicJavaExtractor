PUNCH 88

Ahh

Sail away in under 5 minutes
Fly away in under 5 minutes
The sky ain't the limit
Hell no the sky ain't the limit
It's the basement
It's the basement
It's the basement

OOhh
Baby let it goo

I gotta punch 88
88-8-8
On this damn accelerator
I gotta punch 88
88-8-8
On this damn accelerator
If I wanna get home to you
I gotta punch 88
88-8-8
I wanna get home to you

She wearing them jordache jeans
Throwbacks from 1983
Complexion's flawless
And her hair was like a dream

Hell no the sky ain't the limit
Hell no the sky ain't the limit
It's the basement
It's the basement
It's the basement

OOhh
Baby let it goo

I gotta punch 88
88-8-8
On this damn accelerator
I gotta punch 88
88-8-8
On this damn accelerator
If I wanna get home to you
I gotta punch 88
88-8-8
I wanna get home to you
