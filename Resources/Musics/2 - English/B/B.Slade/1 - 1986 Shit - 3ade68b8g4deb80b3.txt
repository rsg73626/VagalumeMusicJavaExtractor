1986 SHIT

Don't fight the feeling
Ohh Ohh
Roll up a Philly
Philly
Philly
Pink flamingos
Passion fruit
Pitch black ray bans
Italian suits
No socks
Top down
But there's no you
I'm missing you
I-I-I
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

You make me smile
You make me feel like
I'm the only one
Only one

I lose track of time
When I'm with you
(when I'm with you)
You stay on my mind
I've gotta make it back home to you

I gotta get back back back
gotta get back back back
inside of my D-D-D
Delorean
Delorean
Delorean
hey
So I'm changing the station
taking it back

"it's showtime Synergy™"
G-Gimme that 1986 shit

Oh... roll up a Philly
Philly
Philly
get them drinks up in the air
in the club tonight turn up
Armani suits and rock cocaine like
Miami Vice
Turn up
Turn Up

You make me smile
You make me feel like
I'm the only one
Only one

I lose track of time
When I'm with you
(when I'm with you)
You stay on my mind
I've gotta make it back home to you

I gotta get back back back
gotta get back back back
inside of my D-D-D
Delorean
Delorean
Delorean
hey
So I'm changing the station
taking it back

"it's showtime Synergy™"
G-Gimme that 1986 shit

Oh... roll up a Philly
Philly
Philly
get them drinks up in the air
in the club tonight turn up
Armani suits and rock cocaine like
Miami Vice
Turn up
Turn up
Turn Up
