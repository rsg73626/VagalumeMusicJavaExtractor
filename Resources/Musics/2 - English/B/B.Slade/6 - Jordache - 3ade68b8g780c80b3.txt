JORDACHE

Don't ask I have no answers
Hold truths and tell no lies
There's one particular girl I'm after
A different caliber damn she's fine

I can't get her out of my hair
Don't know what she's doing to me
At night I lie alone in my bed
Forbidden thoughts of ecstasy

No I just don't wanna be friends
Because that ain't gonna do it for me
If I let her go I'm gonna regret
The day I let her of the hook so easy

She wearing them Jordache Jeans
Throwbacks from 1983
Complexion's flawless
And her tan was like a dream

She wearing them Jordache Jeans
Throwbacks from 1983
She hardly knows me
But she lives inside of me

Oh oh oh I gotta meet her
I gotta meet her yeah yeah

I can't get her out of my hair
Don't know what she's doing to me
At night I lie alone in my bed
Forbidden thoughts of ecstasy

No I just don't wanna be friends
Because that ain't gonna do it for me
If I let her go I'm gonna regret
The day I let her of the hook so easy

She wearing them Jordache Jeans
Throwbacks from 1983
Complexion's flawless
And her hair was like a dream

She wearing them Jordache Jeans
Throwbacks from 1983
She hardly knows me
But she lives inside of me

Oh oh oh I gotta meet her
I gotta meet her yeah yeah
I wanna meet her oh baby oh baby
I wanna meet her oh baby oh baby
Someday I'm gonna meet her

I can't get her out of my hair
Don't know what she's doing to me
At night I lie alone in my bed
Forbidden thoughts of ecstasy

No I just don't wanna be friends
Because that ain't gonna do it for me
If I let her go I'll regret
I think I wanna say

Oh oh oh that's for you girl
Everybody sing it
Sing it across the world

Oh oh oh
I had a dream about this song last night
And the whole world could do a vocal run
Sang

Oh oh oh I knew you could do it it
All over the world let's
Do it one more time here we go Sang

Oh oh oh sounds good
One more time here we go
