Butt ass naked washing dishes in the kitchen
Write you nasty messages and signed it Charles Dickens
Anything's possible yep I'm on a mission
Making withdrawals yep it's sufficient
There was a time when the shit was insufficient
I smoke pot but no pot for me to piss in
She got that terminator pussy "I'll be back"
Now lemme see you look back

In the valley of the deep blue moon
Top down hair blowing baby who knew
That I would fall for somebody like you
I would fall for somebody like you?

I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna go home
I just wanna go home with you yeah
Home home home home
