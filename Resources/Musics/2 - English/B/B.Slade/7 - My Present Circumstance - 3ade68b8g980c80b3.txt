MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE

People changing faces
Switching places
Don't know who's who but I know
I know who I am
Gotta delete my spam
Clouds in my coffee babe

Why waste my time
Stressing out over things
That I cannot change?
Hey it's alright
Close your eyes make a wish
Blow the candles
Cuz now you're grown

I know I gave it everything I had
Sometimes I feel like you gave up 2 fast
My future won't let me stay in the past
You just don't fit my present circumstance

You're mind is like a slot machine
Now I'm nodding with a gansta lean
Hand's on my steering wheel
What's coffee without the cream?
Cash rules everything around me
So I can't afford to lose my focus

Why waste my time
Stressing out over things
That I cannot change?
Hey it's alright the beginning
The end of the story yeah

I know I gave it everything I had
Sometimes I feel like you gave up 2 fast
My future won't let me stay in the past
You just don't fit my present circumstance

Oh my present circumstance

There was time when I
Sought your approval yeah
Don't wanna fight yeah
& I really don't want a duel
I've had enough well
And I wish you all the best
But I'm doing me yeah
I just dress and rest c'mon jessie

I know I gave it everything I had
Sometimes I feel like you gave up 2 fast
My future won't let me stay in the past
You just don't fit my present circumstance

Oh my present circumstance

Thank you for releasing me
Thank you for rejecting me
You just brought out the best in me
