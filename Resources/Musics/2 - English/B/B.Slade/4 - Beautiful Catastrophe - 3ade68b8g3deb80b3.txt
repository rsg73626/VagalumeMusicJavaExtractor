BEAUTIFUL CATASTROPHE

Oh oh oh oh beautiful catastrophe

The way she walks her sexy waist
Like an hourglass in motion
Her eyes consumed my body liked it
Wasn't aware of her devices

Just like adam and eve
With no clothes on only leaves
Up in the garden ahh
Let's get this started ahh

But when I looked around the room
There was nobdoy sweating you
The girl is bad, I know I'm fine
But could she really be all mine?

The way she walks and she giggle
The way she moves it's official

She shakes that ass makes it wiggle
She gonna be the death of me
That girl's a beautiful catastrophe

Oh oh oh oh
Then you start grabbing on my wrist
I thought what kind of chick is this
You're not the average woman
I can't help but feel like something's going on

Just like adam and eve
With no clothes on only leaves
Up in the garden ahh
Let's get this started ahh

But when I looked around the room
There was nobdoy sweating you
The girl is bad, I know I'm fine
But could she really be all mine?

The way she walks and she giggle
The way she moves it's official

She shakes that ass makes it wiggle
She gonna be the death of me
That girl's a beautiful catastrophe

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
She's so beautiful catastrophe
So miniacal
