2182

Nothing accidental only transcendental
Quantum physics travel light speed

Highways are transparent
And it's quite apparent
I've left time I'm in eternity

My veins are filled with chlorophyll
Cancer cells are a thing of the past
I'm smoking out to lauryn hill
The future cherishes her artifacts

2182 so glad I found you
The future has become a present
Fact of history
And teleportation is just a common luxury
2182

No pollution only pure oxygen yeah
Sexuality & privacy became synonymous yeah

No need for surgery or pills
The dietary plan is found in kale
Humans have lost desire to kill
Cuz everyone's enjoying themselves
