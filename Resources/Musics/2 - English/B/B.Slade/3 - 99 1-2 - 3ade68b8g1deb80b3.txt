99 1-2

I hear people say
That young man has lost his way
Now he's gone astray
So many things have changed
Let me help you pronounce my name
Baby it's B. Sladeâ„¢

I've got a gift and I'm gonna use it
And if I offer you my talent
Please don't abuse it
Never mix business
With authentic friendship
Cuz after they're finished
You'll never hear from them again

So go ahead and judge me
You're good at what you do
But you ain't knowing 'bout
The shit that I've been through
Keep it 100 but you don't want the truth
But baby 99 and a half
Just won't do

Can't dwell on the past
Some things just weren't meant to last
Cuz they weren't built to last
I'm drawn to energy
Gender doesn't apply to me
Now is that so hard to believe

So call me a faggot
Tell you what it means to me
You wish you could have it
But you're not enough man for me
I gotta few habits
Yeah I'm still smoking trees
Deal with the facts
I ain't sweeping it under the mat

So go ahead and judge me
You're good at what you do
But you ain't knowing 'bout
The shit that I've been through
Keep it 100 but you don't want the truth
But baby 99 and a half
Just won't do

You gotta take all of me
Can't take half of me
99 99 99 99
I am what I am
I is what I is
Yeah yeah yeah
Go head and judge me
Cuz you're good at it
Talk your shit, you can have at it
You should never take a self
With a backstabber
Don't give a fuck about
You're uninformed chit chatter
And you ain't gotta take your life
Cuz it gets better
When she asked me personal questions
I came back with straight answers
About 3 weeks later found out my mama
Had a rare cancer
About 3 months later she passed away
From the rare cancer

And when my Dad was on his death bed
He turned me over to Bishop Wagner
He preached my mama's eulogy
And then about 3 weeks after
I got a call on the red carpet
At the Grammys from Christian Wagner
She said "My daddy is Gone! "
I said "No, no this can't be happening"
For the past 5 years I've just pretended
Like it didn't happen
2004 I had to stand in front of six caskets
Reading all your nasty comments
On youtube with no compassion
