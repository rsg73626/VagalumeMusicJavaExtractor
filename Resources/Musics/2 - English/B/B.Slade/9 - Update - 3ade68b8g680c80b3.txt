UPDATE

You always fall somewhere right behind
Space continuum fast-forward and rewind
Banging on that podium won't stop the time
Pull me over to the side if you know that
This card's declined

And you might taxi on the runway
But you ain't fly mm
Coney island Nathan's hot dog hold the sides

In 19 hundred and seventeen
18 hundred and twenty three
Seemed so far away
In 19 hundred and sixty three
2015 seemed so far away

"am I the only that's not feeling
This new itunes software update? "

Hot damn oh man
Every time I turn around
There's another update
Then another update can't take
I just can't take it no more
No more not another update now

28 and forty three 2015 seemed so far away
Back in 1982 when Prince made 1999
It seemed so far away

I'm so caught up
Iphone I get so caught up with you
Immediate responses to all my needs
The only sedative that won't let me sleep

Hot damn oh man
Every time I turn around
There's another update
Then another update can't take
I just can't take it no more
No more not another-nother-nother
