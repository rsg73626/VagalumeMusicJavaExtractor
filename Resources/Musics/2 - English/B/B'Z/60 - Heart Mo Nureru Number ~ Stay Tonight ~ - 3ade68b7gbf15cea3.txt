HEART MO NURERU NUMBER ~ STAY TONIGHT ~

Itsumade kurai heya de odotteiru no
Mado wo shimekittamama ja kaze mo fukanai
Kurikaeshi nagareru same old blues
Kimi wa shirazu ni sugatteru

If you let me stay tonight I'll give you anything
Ha-to mo nureru number
I will make it alright don't cry anymore
Te wo nobashite okure right now

Kizutskisou ni naru to me wo fusete
Yume wo mitai nante mou omoi wa shinai
Aseta makeup tight for you
Nagasu koto mo dekiru no ni

If you let me stay tonight I'll give you anything
Mayonaka iro no rouge
I will make it alright don't cry anymore
Te wo nobashite okure

Let me stay tonight I'll give you anything
Zawameku machi no kaori wo
I will make it alright don't cry anymore
Te wo nobashite okure

If you let me stay tonight I'll give you anything
Ha-to mo nureru number
I will make it alright don't cry anymore
Te wo nobashite okure

Let me stay tonight I'll give you anything
Mayonaka iro no rouge
I will make it alright don't cry anymore
Te wo nobashite okure
