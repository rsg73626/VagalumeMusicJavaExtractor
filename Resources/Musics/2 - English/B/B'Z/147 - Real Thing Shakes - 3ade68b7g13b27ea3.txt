REAL THING SHAKES

Can’t fall asleep I don’t know why
I know it’s not cause of the world situation
Watching TV bad news all around
But that’s not the reason I’m so scared now

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm
Something’s burnin’ like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky
You and me we can find a way to fly

Lots of trouble in the country
Leaders changing day after day
But it don’t matter don’t care about it
I just want you to get closer to me

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm
Something’s burnin’ like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky
You and me we can find a way to fly

I got something I need to say
Uh...you can believe me
You know I’m changing
I can tell you I’ve been aching
Who’s cryin’, who’s crying now
Don’t wanna lose you don’t wanna turn away

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm
Something’s burnin’ like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky
You and me we can find a way to fly

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm
Something’s burnin’ like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky
You and me we can find a way to fly
