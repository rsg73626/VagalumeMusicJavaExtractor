FRICTION!

Living in this boring world (Oh yeah) 
Every day just passing by (Oh yeah) 
Nobody's fault, I'm making my choice all the time 

Standing still, feet on the run (Oh yeah) 
Take the sky, never see the sun (Oh yeah) 
Never mind, still searching for a sign 

Something is wrong... 
We're losing our senses... 
Really need to know what I am 

Shouting out my name (Shout it out) 
Trying to find my way (Find it out) 
I just need a new sensation (I just need a new sensation) 

Can't just live and die (No we can't) 
Baby I've come alive (for myself) 
Pull the thread from all distinctions 
We can't make it, we've got FRICTION! 

I'm still alive, is this modern world (Oh yeah) 
Filling the world with empty words (Oh no) 
They're just killing time and making nowhere with mine 
What's going on? Everything in haze 
I'm not hiding anymore 

Shouting out my name (Shout it out) 
Walking down Broadway (Broadway) 
I just got a new direction (I just got a new direction) 
Baby I'd better fight (like a dog) 
I've gotta live my life (for myself) 
Won't be scared to lose everything 

Shouting out my name 
Trying to make it seem a phase 
Now I've gotta do it my way (Now I've gotta do it my way) 
Baby I've gotta fight (like a dog) 
Fight for my life (for myself) 
And nothing that I won't be missing 
Nothing happens without FRICTION!
