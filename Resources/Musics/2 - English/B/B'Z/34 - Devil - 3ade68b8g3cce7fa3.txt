DEVIL

See the tears, falling on my green skin
I can feel the fear, it's always all around me
Everybody's doing fine, but I just sit there suffering
Heavy is life, when it's painted with lies

I try not to hurt you, why do you hurt me?
Something's growing in your soul
Trying to look for an easy way out
But nothing's gonna change
You know your own Devil's gonna fly
So just let it go

Fly with the Devil's wing to get one real thing
Look with the Devil's eye, just don't miss your train
Fly with the Devil's wing to get one real thing
Kiss with the Devil's lips, wake up your brain

Fly... with... your... Devil...

Fly with the Devil's wing to get one real thing
Look with the Devil's eye, just don't miss your train
Fly with the Devil's wing to get one real thing
Kiss with the Devil's lips, wake up your brain

You try to raise your fist, but you're paralyzed
You try to scream to the end of the sky, but it's still a whisper

Fly with the Devil's wing to get one real thing
Look with the Devil's eye, just don't miss your train
Fly with the Devil's wing to get one real thing
Kiss with the Devil's lips, wake up your brain

Fly with the Devil's wing
Fly with the Devil's wing
