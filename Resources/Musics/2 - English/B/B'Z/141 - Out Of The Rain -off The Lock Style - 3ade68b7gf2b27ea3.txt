OUT OF THE RAIN -OFF THE LOCK STYLE

I hate face it all alone
Why you've been crying, baby, all night long
In the rain, I can find the man who's waiting for you

Don't turn away, day by day
You treat me so bad
I can tell it by the way your talking
Calling your name
But the squall keeps scratching my voice
Is it something that I've said
That's making you sad…

Take me out of the rain
Oh - I might as well die for your love
Don't you know you make me feel pain
Oh - Please give me just a little more time
Won't you take me out of the rain
Oh, I wasn't born to lose you, girl
Don't you know I'm going insane
Oh - anyway I wanna hold you tonight

My soul's just getting' soaking wet
No one will dare to look at me
In this town
People don't care for their neighbors

Don't turn away, one more try
That's all I'm asking for
I will never make it by myself, oh baby
Calling your name but can't find any shelter from the rain
Is it something that I've done
That's making you sad…

Oh - I might as well die for your love
Don't you know you make me feel pain
Oh - Please give me just a little more time
Won't you take me out of the rain
Oh, I wasn't born to lose you, girl
Don't you know I'm going insane
Oh - anyway I wanna hold you tonight

Don't turn away, chasing a dream
I'm losing my baby
But you know, I'm never gonna give her up
Calling you name oh, please don't say
It's too late
I'm sure I will take one step out the door

Oh - I might as well die for your love
Don't you know you make me feel pain
Oh - Please give me just a little more time
Won't you take me out of the rain
Oh, I wasn't born to lose you, girl
Don't you know I'm going insane
Oh - anyway I wanna hold you tonight
