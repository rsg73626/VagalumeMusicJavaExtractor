REMEMBERED

How do you want to be remembered?
For your honor or your pride?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your body or your mind?

Time is on my side
with every breath I'm alive
I realise money is worthless
With every dollar I earned yes ( yes)

I got a faith to burn I guess
 this pretty faces living the fastest
A heartless soul is made out of plastic
I got no time for the past yet

I feel the minutes slip on by
I will sink with the steps out stride and I
I fly close to sun
It's why the

It's why the good die young
I leave no song unsong
A heartless soul is big for given
The past is only gived to forgiven

The time is on my side
With every breath I'm alive
How do you want to be remembered?
For your anger or your love?

How do you want to be remembered?
For your beauty or your blood?
Time, time goes tic, tic, tic
On by, Before you know is dear

Before you know you're love they're dying
Those sense thats slowing in to the past
High oh high and fast, I
I learned a simple lesson

 be kind and count your blessings
A Real life is rat race
I'd rather move at a snails pace
I'd rather laught with a flat face

cause my best days, drifin by
from the suniest sky from the warm rays
I'm a follow this road, until I find light
bright or small stay strong for the good fight

And time is on my side
with every breath I'm alive
Maybe you can close your eyes
 and watch the movie of your life

Or just stop and play along
Lets come play and I'll start pray
 and you are gone
How do you want to be remembered?
( from the begining just saying )

For your passion or your faith?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your father or your name?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your actions or your words?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your silence or your voice?
Leave a legacy...
