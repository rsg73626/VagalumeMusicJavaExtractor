AUTO-AGGRESSION

Forced to a mechanical status
now listen to this music
and smash their faces

in this eyes of horror
in this world of agony
the only beauty is in blood
this is no phantasy

Auto-Aggression

Auto-Aggression
comin’ everyday
when I am lost in problems
anyway

Auto-Aggression
feel so sick in mind
when I rip your body
I am so blind

the dead
the beauty
the fire in your arms
the light in your eyes
in the morning I awake
I know I be alive

it was just a dream
in my distorted reality
it was only just a dream
impact brutality

like a machine
I feel no sorrow
don’t ask
and do the horror

Auto-Aggression
is my reality
Auto-Aggression
is no phantasy
the urge for violence-control
is in human being
and not in my soul

... and not in my soul...

Auto-Aggression
