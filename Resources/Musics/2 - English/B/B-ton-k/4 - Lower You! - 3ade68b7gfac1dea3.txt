LOWER YOU!

Lower you!
together we fall
Lower you!
the death will call

down on your knees
you start to pray
beggin’ please"
this ain’t a play

your friend is ugly
your friend is so nice
you love his fist
you hold him tight

he rip you off
like a machine
without a soul
separating your peel

your bones hurt
the skin feels like fire
the sheath is bloody
set on a barbed wire

Lower you inside your brain
Lower you together we drain

Lower you!
together we fall
Lower you!
the death will call

down on your knees
you start to pray
beggin’ please"
this ain’t a play

Lower you!
together we fall
Lower you!
the death will call

down on your knees
you start to pray
beggin’ please"
this ain’t a play

your bones hurt
the skin feels like fire
the sheath is bloody
set on a barbed wire

Lower you inside your brain
Lower you together we drain

no fear of decay
you’re hurt and feel desire
no fear of decay
pain makes you fly higher
no fear of decay
the wound you lick
your flesh lies open
no fear of decay
your sick
your will is broken.

Lower you!
