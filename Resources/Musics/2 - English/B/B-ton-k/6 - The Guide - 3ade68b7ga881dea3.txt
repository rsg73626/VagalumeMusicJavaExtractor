THE GUIDE

The negative format
your own hell in life
depression increase
with drugs you survive

your faith is in murder
only death you enjoy
you are a killing machine
live life to destroy

you’re the new guide
you’re the new guide

you run away
the loss of control
I am the guide
the guide of your soul
like angel-dust
I’ll blow your mind
Don’t leave my way!
Don’t look behind!

You have no friends
no real chance
there is no reason to run
no reason to hide

just raise your own pride

you run away
the loss of control
I am the guide
the guide of your soul
like angel-dust
I’ll blow your mind
Don’t leave my way!
Don’t look behind!
your surround is a mess
you fell like licking a bone
your heart is cold
cold as a stone

you take your guns
hoist the flag in the air
uniform to arrange
for their life
you don’t care

you run away
the loss of control
I am your guide
the guide of your soul
like angel dust
I’ll blow your mind
Don’t leave my way!
Don’t look behind!

I am your guide
I am inside
I am your guide
I am inside You!

I am inside ... You!
I am inside You!
Inside You!

Your guide inside You!
