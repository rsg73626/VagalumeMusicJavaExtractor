THIS IS MY WORLD

Horny today I do believe 
That I have to open your eyes 
And now I'm looking for a light 
For a light to let me shine 

I need to fly across a mountain 
And then I need to touch the place 
I want to get the ring in my hands 
I feel the sun on me 

This is my world 
This is my time 
And I belong to all I see 
A dreamland to be 

Say that you want to stay tonight 
Let me take you deeper inside 
And now i'm gonna find a way 
Got to leave me to the sky.
