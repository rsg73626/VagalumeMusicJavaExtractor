THE WIND OF JULY

The sun was going down 
Burning out the day 
Feeling so lonely deep inside 
I was afraid.. 
I just could not find the words 
But in the end I tried to say 

I need a road 
To lead me far from here 
It's not my life 
This is not home 
It's time to get away 

The wind of July 
Was blowing in my hair 
My hands 
I will never forget it 
The tears on your face 
Were running dry and now 
Forgive me ...my love 

Maybe I'm not so good for you 
And you for me 
This is the matter after all 
There's something missing in our days 
And in our nights 
It's killing loving day by day 

We need a break 
We need a clear blue sky 
There is no fun in what i say...but 
It's time to get away 

Here ( now ) I'm calling 
Calling your name 
Can't you hear me ??? 
Tell me you can 
Are you waiting ? 
Waiting for me 
Cause I miss you.
