NEVER GIVE UP

Woke up this morning and 
Saw you were standing there 
A cup of coffee... in your hand 
A stormy weather out 
You say... you've had enough 
And now you wanna say ...bye bye 
You're my oochie coochie man 

You're packing all your bags 
Taking everything but me 
I could be coo-coo-cool 
But I just wanna scream and shout 
Don't wanna loose you and 
I don't wanna stop to fight 

I'll never give up 
And I'll never give in 
Don't wanna let you go this time 
I'll never give up 
And I'll never give in 
This is how I feel it 

You're looking nervous and 
You're slipping from my hands 
Someone is knock in' at the door 
Who can it be ? Toc toc 
Is it a new love... babe ? 
But I could not open... maybe 

Don't turn your back on me 
Let me try just one more time 
You outta wait... you outta give me 
My last funking chance 
C'mon and please me, babe 
You know... I'll be pleasing you 
I swear.
