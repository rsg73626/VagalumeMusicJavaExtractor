I COULDN'T FIND A WAY

Never thought I'd feel your pain or sorrow 
Never thought I'd realize 
That our time is borrowed 
Never thought that I'd be scared to see tomorrow 
But I know there's some things I can't change 

But I couldn't find a way 
To take your pain away 
I couldn't even find a single word 
For me to say 
If I could bring you here today 
We'd get down on our knees and we'd pray 
But I couldn't find a way 

We can only choose one road to follow 
But we will never know when 
That road will end 
And even if we never see tomorrow 
But I know there's some things 
We can't change 

A way for me to catch you when you fall 
A way for me to break down every wall 
A way for me to pick you up 
And keep you honey 
Keep you standing tall ...
