THE DREAM

Can't believe 
Out of time 
Look down, but I'm afraid to fall 

Solitude 
On sleeping sand 
That voice is taking me away 

And I feel I'm floating downstream 
Emptiness 
Just like I've never been born 
Vision of colours 
Steppin' inside now I know I'm free 

I see you there 
See the people standing there 
I'm everywhere 
And this is not a state of mind 
I wave my hand 
Now gimme space I can be 
All I feel is delight 

The more I go inside 
The more there is to see 
Somebody's calling and I sing 

Rocking horse 
And little bird of green 
Saying that I'm no longer blind 

Have the stars in place of my eyes 
Tenderness 
I've never had it before 
Sight of an angel 
Steppin' outside now I know I'm free.
