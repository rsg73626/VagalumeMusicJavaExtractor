SUMMER HAS GONE

In the middle of the night 
When I'm dreaming of your smile 
It s a wonderful emotion 
I can feel you by my side 

Can t you hear my voice 
Is calling loud your name ? 
Will I find peace of mind ? 
Do you ever think of me ? 

Summer has gone 
And I am still alive 
Winter has come 
And I don't want to cry (die) 

Summer has gone 
And we just said goodbye 
Will you bring back 
The sunshine in my life 

When I walk among the crowd 
I keep on looking for your face 
If I take a look around 
I know this is not my place 

Can you hear my voice 
Is calling loud your name 
I will try to remind 
Every little thing you said.
