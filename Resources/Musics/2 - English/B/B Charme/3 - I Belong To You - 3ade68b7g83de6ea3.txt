I BELONG TO YOU

When you're walking by 
I'm feeling inside just butterflies 
I'm getting so high 
If only you stand so close and 
All that I can do 
Is to please you 
To stay together 
All that I can give 
Is my loving 
Now and ever 
Come and hold me tight 
No one can deny 

I belong to you, now 
You're the rhythm filling all my life 
I belong to you, now 
Only you can get me satisfied 

I'm trusting you babe 
I'm putting my heart in your hands 
I know I could fly 
If you wanna take me with you 
All I wanna see 
Is a lifetime 
To stay together 
All I wanna be 
Is your honey 
Now and ever 
Come and hold me tight 
No one can deny 

I belong to you 
Never say goodbye 
I belong to... 
All I wanna... 
Is belong to you.
