BLOOD CELL SEAL

When it all comes together, it just starts making 
sense to me. This room is about as empty as it gets, 
these walls are getting closer and closer. I'm all 
bubbly inside now. We saw each other in that crowd 
and you gave me those looks that could kill that 
night that I wrote that letter that's still, unbroken 
with a blood cell seal. Come on baby lets go. Jump in 
the front seat can you drive tonight it seems I'm all 
beat but you know that wont happen your touch 
under the covers your eyes I'm lost hairs stick up on 
the back of my neck and now I've got tunnel vision 
cuz this turnpike wont stop, it wont stop with the 
lights on the top of this hill. It's a perfect time in a 
perfect world the perfect nights with the perfect girl 
but I don't want to spend another night without you 
in my arms. I wished you were here with me, I 
swear the next time I see you I'm gonna tell you 
that I'll love you like no one else will. Tonight¡¯s the 
night turn out the candled light make me breathe 
again thank you for this life were gonna count the 
stars and maybe walk in the park tomorrow, then 
we'll make out for hours! No I don't want to spend 
another night lonely night without you in my arms.
