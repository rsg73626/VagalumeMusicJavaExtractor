YOUR HEAVEN, MY HELL

Well guess I was the luckiest kid ever, mends would be the key the heart to the sever burnt like this, damn shot and missed.
Slam the door drop the pen cuz im a bore, just let me fall off this stage cuz you know that it would be better than thinking that I dont have you.
WHY did I do this to myself? I guess dreams don't exist your, just a santa clause myth, and these skyline lights make these voices carry out just a little more.

LETS STEP IN THE RING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

You never told me I was such a bother, just think back when we used to laugh together.
You were my angel, never left my side to the end it was just a lie.

Can I just have three shots of the houses best drink? Believe it or not the rings still in the back pocket wishing it could find a home, instead I lose those smiles that I used to sport down the runway.
WHY, did I do this to myself? I guess Im stuck looking at these endless faces that seem to resemble your heaven now this is my hell.

LETS STEP IN THE RING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

You never told me I was such a bother, just think back when we used to laugh together.
You were my angel, never left my side to the end it was just a lie.

Don't stop, don't stop, don't leave me here thinking were not,
Don't stop, don't stop, don't leave me here
Everything needs to fade and everyone get away.
Everything needs to fade and everyone get away.

LETS STEP IN THE RING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

You never told me I was such a bother, just think back when we used to laugh together.
You were my angel, never left my side to the end it was just a lie.
