ZERO

With one
Peace stone
You ain't going nowhere as long as he is the driver
You can ride with him, but it will never be the same, same, same
One look at him tells me you want to be taken higher
See the problem is you wish he could make you feel the way I do

Chorus
Why waste time when you know I got it?
Come on baby you know you want it
You know it's possible to get what you're looking for
Float him, he can do it
Like me, I'm gon' prove it
I got a question can you help me out?
How many people can do it like me?
Zero
Keep it so cool like me?
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Else that can make it so hot like me
Zero
Take it to the top like me
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Zero

It ain't a good look, you got me in your caller
You can rock him, but he'll never feel my space, space, space
One look at him, tells me he's not the right one for you
I don't understand why you settle beneath for second place

Chorus
Why waste time when you know I got it?
Come on baby you know you want it
You know it's possible to get what you're looking for
Float him, he can do it
Like me, I'm gon' prove it
I got a question can you help me out?
How many people can do it like me?
Zero
Keep it so cool like me?
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Else that can make it so hot like me
Zero
Take it to the top like me
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Zero

There is only one girl that can make you feel right
That's mean for something dying
So don't even try to make it work
Wait until you know I'm the original, nal, nal, nal, nal, nal, nal

How many people can do it like me?
Zero
Keep it so cool like me?
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
There ain't nobody, yeahh
Else that can make it so hot like me
Zero
Take it to the top like me
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Ohhhh
How many people can do it like me?
Zero
Keep it so cool like me?
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Else that can make it so hot like me
Woo
Zero
Take it to the top like me
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
There's nobody
How many people can do it like me?
Zero
Keep it so cool like me?
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
Else that can make it so hot like me
Woo
Zero
Take it to the top like me
Zero
Girl you know their ain't nobody, nobody
