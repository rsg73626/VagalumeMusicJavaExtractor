BANDAIDS AND ICE

I pheen for you like my last broken cigarette,
these two shots of whiskey stuck on the corner of the street,
arrest me for something that I didn't do,
lock me up and put me away so i can forget about your constantly bad moods.

To you im just so ordinary and now i hate what you make me.

Your smell seems to linger like this taste this taste on my finger
open and bleeding through these bandaids and ice
this dull knife just won't do.

It's just another bad dream about you,
but is it ok to say that i want to stay in this nightmare forever and feel those spiders that say they care.

To you im just so ordinary and now i hate what you make me.

Your smell seems to linger like this taste this taste on my finger
open and bleeding through these bandaids and ice
this dull knife just won't do.

Your smell seems to linger like this taste this taste on my finger
open and bleeding through these bandaids and ice
this dull knife just won't do.

I saw the light on in your window, but you said you didn't know when you couldn't reply
how did you think that i would be so stupid, to believe all those lies?

Your smell seems to linger like this taste this taste on my finger
open and bleeding through these bandaids and ice
this dull knife just won't do.

Your smell seems to linger like this taste this taste on my finger
open and bleeding through these bandaids and ice
this dull knife just won't do.
