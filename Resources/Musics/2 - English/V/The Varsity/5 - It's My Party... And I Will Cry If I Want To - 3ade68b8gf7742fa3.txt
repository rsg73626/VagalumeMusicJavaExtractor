IT'S MY PARTY... AND I WILL CRY IF I WANT TO

you wear ? around your ? that means that you can?
don't worry about calling me back tonight,
it's your life, so do what you want to do.

and all i ever wanted was to just hold your hand.
then i lost it all. remember when?
now the time came, didn't you sleep
better knowing i was there?
"i miss you," she said with a tear in her eye.
and i whispered "goodbye."

the stereo said ?? my mind. 
it let's me think.
we gotta sell it all. give it up and move along.
don't you have it all figured out now?
