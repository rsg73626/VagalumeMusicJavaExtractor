FUTURE LOVE

a couple of years
and i'm gonna know your name
it's like i'm waiting for you forever
and i notice myself, insane
but it won't be long
til we gonna take this up
what i'm talking about
is future love

it's so far away
and baby you're in this door
got me picturing your face again
something worth waiting for
i put all others behind me
they don't live up
i know what i want, what i need to the T

baby if they ask me
i would say i don't even know your name
and when they ask me
does it change
no it don't change a thing
'cause it's something about the way you love me
and it's something about the way you know me
that i can't explain enough

there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love
there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love

walking hand in hand
going on the second date
i can picture what you're wearin'
and the kiss i can almost taste
thought of all the ways
we meet for the very first time
i can see the place
feel the love at first sight

baby if they ask me
i would say i don't even know your name
and when they ask me
does it change
no it don't change a thing
'cause it's something about the way you love me
and it's something about the way you know me
that i can't explain enough

there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love
there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love

oh no, the minute you pull up next to me
we standin' there like destiny
when it feels like you're fighting just to play
that's when you know

the minute i pull up next to you
suddenly you don't know what to do
everything inside you says that i'm the one

baby if they ask me
i would say i don't even know your name
and when they ask me
does it change
no it don't change a thing
'cause it's something about the way you love me
and it's something about the way you know me
that i can't explain enough

baby if they ask me
i would say i don't even know your name
and when they ask me
does it change
no it don't change a thing
'cause it's something about the way you love me
and it's something about the way you know me
that i can't explain enough

there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love
there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love
there's just something about a
future love, future love, future love

future love, yeah
