THE SIGNAL

Hold back your thoughts again
Turn on that box again
Those neon lights again
Hold back your thoughts again

Dont let yourself be fooled by them
Do you know you are controlled by them?
And if you see or hear from them
Dont let yourself be fooled by them

Smashing through your ears and eyes
The signal comes in its disguise
To subdue your childrens lives
Your piece of mind is what it buys

Black stained hands hold tight to it
While eyes strain to filter it
The signal won't let you ignore it
Black stained hands hold tight to it

The signal is what brought you here
The waves crashing is all you hear
A drum, a lobe too clear you here
The signal that which brought you here

Smashing through your ears and eyes
The signal comes in its disguise
To subdue your children's lives
Your piece of mind is what it buys
