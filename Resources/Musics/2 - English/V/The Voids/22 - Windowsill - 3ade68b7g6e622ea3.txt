WINDOWSILL

I sat on a window sill and watched all
My view was not impeaded
By clouded glass that broke away in storms
My eyes did not focus on one
Or all who ever existed or ever will

With no bias or prejudice I observed
(And passed judgement on none)
We looked so peaceful
with no hatred in our eyes but then...

Once more with my blind eyes
I saw the sill on which I sat consumed in flames
And I fell

With my blind eyes I saw the sill
On which i sat consumed in flames
And I fell
I fell
I fell

With no bias
Or prejudice I observed
(And passed judgement on none)
We looked so peaceful
With no hatred in our eyes but then...

Once more with my blind eyes
I saw the sill on which i sat consumed in flames
And I fell 
With my blind eyes i saw the sill
On which i sat consumed in flames
And I fell
I fell
I fell
I fucking fell
