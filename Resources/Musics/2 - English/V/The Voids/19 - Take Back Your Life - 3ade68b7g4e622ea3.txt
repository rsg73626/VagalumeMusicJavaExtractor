TAKE BACK YOUR LIFE

Fishing for the truth
Taking in everything
Searching for the unknown
Trying for just anything
Peel the layers back
Exposing all that's not seen
Strip down to the bone
Open up your T.V. screen

Scratching at the surface your frozen under ice
Trying as you may to grasp, cut, and slice
Losing yourself in a world thats not your own
Lashing at the atrocities that you cannot condone

Then the static buzz rears its ugly head
The man in the reflection says your better off dead
After this and more is done and said
You must...take back your life!

Freedom is a precious gift
A gift you think you have
But when you trap yourself like this
Freedom turns its back
They take away your freedoms
One by one by one
Why the fuck should I care
If you can no longer see the sun?

Does it hurt to sit there on the couch
With a cattle prod up your ass?
Or do you feel a bit confused
when they herd you into mass?
Or do you think you're normal
With a house, three kids and wife?
Do you realize what slipped away from you?
You must...take back your life.

Then the static buzz rears its ugly head
And the man in the reflection says your better off dead
After this and more is done and said
You must...Take back your life!
