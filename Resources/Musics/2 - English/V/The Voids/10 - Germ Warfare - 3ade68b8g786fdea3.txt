GERM WARFARE

Turned on the t.v, each channel just the same
Germ warfare, warfare, the topic of today
Why must they say this? no i don't want to hear
Of this possibility, of this kind of fear
Why can't we just live, no violence, no more fights
I just want to live here, no i don't want to die!

Germ warfare, germ warfare
That's all they keep saying
Germ warfare, germ warfare
Nobody can survive
Germ warfare, germ warfare
That's all they keep saying
Germ warfare, germ warfare
No i don't want to die!

Some say it'll never happen
But it's closer than we think
A disease that spreads just as easy as we breathe
No masks can save us, no you can't run and hide
From this kind of warfare, from this kind of fright
Why can't we just live? we've never done a thing
To suffer, to die, for someone else's beliefs

Germ warfare, germ warfare
That's all they keep saying
Germ warfare, germ warfare
Nobody can survive
Germ warfare, germ warfare
That's all they keep saying
Germ warfare, germ warfare
No i don't want to die!
