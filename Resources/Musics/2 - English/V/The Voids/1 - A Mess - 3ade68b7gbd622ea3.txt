A MESS

I'm not a doll for you to play with
I'm not a pet to be bought and taught
I'm not an object and don't want affection
if it only brings you a new position
never shut my mouth for your benefit
never dress up for your compliment
undo my chains and I'll do the rest
don't want your affection, this is a mess

love
fuck fuck fuck fuck love
love love this is not love
undo my chains, fuck the rest

I'm not a toy for you to throw around
I'm a fighter, won't end up on the ground
won't take hate, won't take hostility
no fucking chance if that's a probability
I'm a woman not a fucking toy
I'm a man not a fucking boy
undo my chains and I'll do the rest
don't want your affection this is a mess

love
fuck fuck fuck fuck love
love love this is not love
undo my chains, fuck the rest

this is a mess!

love
fuck fuck fuck fuck love
love
fuck fuck fuck fuck love
