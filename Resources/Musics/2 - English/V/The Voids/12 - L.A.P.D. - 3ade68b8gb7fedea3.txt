L.A.P.D.

Saw you in your uniform
Ready for battles in the streets
Have your weapons by your side
Holding your head up too high
Picking on the innocent
It's not fair, it's shit, shit, shit
Is there anything better to do?
How about i pick on you?

L.a.p.d-what do you think we think of you?
L.a.p.d-crooked men, crooked rules
L.a.p.d-to serve and to protect
L.a.p.d-who'll protect me from you?

Saw your badge on your chest
Shines of lies, filth and shit
Somewhere a real crime is happening
You're still harassing me drinking
Picking on the innocent
It's not fair, it's shit, shit, shit
Is there anything better to do?
How about i pick on you?

L.a.p.d-what do you think we think of you?
L.a.p.d-crooked men, crooked rules
L.a.p.d-to serve and to protect
L.a.p.d-who'll protect me from you?
