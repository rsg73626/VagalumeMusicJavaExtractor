OTHER VOICES

Times have changed i have to say
Not much is real, not much the same
Drowned out the old without a clue
Tell me what this means to you
Masquerades in holes and pins
It's not a game no one can win
This time has brought us no real thing
The roots are lost of this scene

No name places
No name faces
Different voices
Different choices
Nothing to prove only to say
Doing what they want their way

Years ago on darkened streets
Drums were pounding to a different beat
They that walked agaisnt the rest
Shouting loud of their protest
Years ago in tiny places
They came together, no ordinary faces
Loud music and truthful voices
Shouting loud of their choices

No name places
No name faces
Different voices
Different choices
Nothing to prove only to say
Doing what they want their way
