KILL A GENERATION

Kill me please (but you've already done it)
Fuck success (that's already done)
Keep me poor (that's how i was born)
Keep me dumb (and kill another generation)

Watch men go marching in
Devils in a masquerade(kill kill kill)
Invade a nation
You were put upon a stage
To kill a generation

Slit my wrists (take all hope away)
Spread disease (among the disgraced)
Take more lives (as long as it's not "ours")
Keep us blind (and kill another generation)

Watch men go marching in
Devils in a masquerade(kill kill kill)
Invade a nation
You were put upon a stage
To kill a generation
