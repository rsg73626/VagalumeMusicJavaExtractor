PRODUCT

Open your eyes, open your eyes
Because everyone's just following
If we're not careful they'll control us all
With their science and technology
They'll mother us all
We'll be test tube babies
They program us well
With chips placed inside

I'll never be their product
If i have a say
What will they try?
What will we see?
They'll never fool me
They'll never fool me

Government buildingd will be our cribs
And from our birth we'll be property
They'll tell us what we have to do
They'll tell us who we have to be
No complaints, we won't see
What they've done, what they've conceieved
With all the new discoveries
What will they do to you and me?

I'll never be their product
If i have a say
What will they try?
What will we see?
They'll never fool me
They'll never fool me

No they fucking won't!
