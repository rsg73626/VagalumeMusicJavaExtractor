FRIGHTENING WAYS

Decades of the same mistakes
Different situations but the same politics
Running us down with your frightening ways
Too many worlds that never learned
To many worlds to save

Not me, I can't fight alone
Too much to hate that I condone
Not much has changed in this sad, sad world
Too many have died for this mad, mad world
Religious wars, race wars, cleansing
No one has learned those first time around
The nuclear race is neverending
Who will win? The death toll will tell
It's much bigger than the right and wrong side
Both, there's always intentions behind
No one sees the small genocides
That are taking place in other's lives
Not much has changed in this dying, dying world
Too many have tried in this wrong, wrong world
