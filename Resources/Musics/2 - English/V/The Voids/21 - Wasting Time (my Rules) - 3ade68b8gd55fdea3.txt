WASTING TIME (MY RULES)

You're so smart, you're so wise
But you're only wasting time
Following crowds just like the rest
It's a shame you're just like them
It's all their rules, it's only their way
It's only what they say, and who will change it?

We're not getting younger and our time is here
We are the kids and we should be heard

What do you thing when you're all alone?
My rules, my rules
Do you really want to follow
Their rules, their rules?
We should sit and wonder why
We're silent all the time
My rules, my rules!

We're not getting younger and our time is here
We are the kids and we should be heard

Voice your opinion loud and strong
Or we will never get anywhere
Show conviction for what you believe in
Or what do we matter anyway?
We're not getting younger
And our time is here
We should be telling them
My rules!
My rules!
