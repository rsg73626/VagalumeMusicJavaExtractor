FUCK YOU

Always putting me down
No we're not the same
Just another asshole
A sitting no-brain
Go on again, state your ignorance
Smash my beliefs
I get it, i'll bet you're living
Some shit like the american dream!

Talk, talk, talk
That's all you do
Always putting me down
Talk, talk, talk
What's new? you ignorant shit!
Talk, talk, talk
Here's my cue... fuck you!!

"hey kid, get a life
Be like us, sacrifice."
All of that is bad advice
No we're not the same
Go on again, say what you'll say
Lose your temper, call me names
Because what i question, what i do
I don't care to know you

Talk, talk, talk
That's all you do
Always putting me down
Talk, talk, talk
What's new? you ignorant shit!
Talk, talk, talk
Here's my cue... fuck you!!
