ENOUGH

I won't give in to society
rules of living, how to be
I'll make my own rules
I'll make my own dreams
different from magazines
different from screens
I won't surrender who I'm supposed to be
to follow the ways of people I see
I live the way I like, I live the way I please
I live the way I like and this is how I'll be

all that media swarming through my eyes
enough, enough, a bunch of lies
tell me who I am, tell me what is right
fuck you, fuck you, this is my life

all that media swarming through my eyes
enough, enough, a bunch of lies
tell me who I am, tell me what is right
fuck you, fuck you, this is my life

no hope for me when I can't see
what's really going on
one opinion spreads like disease
polluting minds and planting seeds
that what you believe is not the truth
that what they believe is good for you
don't like the way I live
don't like what I believe
but I live the way I like
and I live the way I please

all that media swarming through my eyes
enough, enough, a bunch of lies
tell me who I am, tell me what is right
fuck you, fuck you, this is my life
