BIG BUSINESS

I live in a city not far from here
Where in the air the waste is clear
The morning smell is full of shame
Big business, greddy hads are to blame
Money, money is all they want
We buy their products, our lives are gone
Money, money is all they want
Can't you see what you've bought?

Big business, your money, my misery
Big business, your money, my shame
Big business, greedy hands are the ones to blame

Their dispostion is all the same
No one knows their fucked up game
Disease is spreading everywhere
That morning cloud is a cancerous nightmare
Money, money is all they want
We buy their products, our lives are gone
Money, moeny is all they want
Can't you see what you've bought?

Big business, your money, my misery
Big business, your money, my shame
Big business, greedy hands are the ones to blame
