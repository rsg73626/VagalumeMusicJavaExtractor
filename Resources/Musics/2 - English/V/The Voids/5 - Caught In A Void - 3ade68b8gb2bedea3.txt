CAUGHT IN A VOID

Falling
Sinking
Spinning
Without a sound
No light to be found

From the moment you left today
Nothing much is going your way
And you have nothing important to say
Your world is just slipping away
Distance yourself from the rest
Your solitude is what you like best
Is this one of life's little tests?
Your thoughts no one could guess

Falling
Sinking
Spinning
Without a sound
No light to be found

You're caught in a void, plummeting
Through darkness in your mind
Lost and annoyed, searching
To fill the void inside
You can't describe the hatred and strife
There's something missing from your life
Sit there waiting for the man with the scythe

Falling
Sinking
Spinning
Without a sound no light to be found
Without a sound no light to be found
Without a sound no light to be found...down
Without a sound no light to be found...down
Without a sound no light to be found...down
