STAINED GLASS

Staring through stained glass
Upon hallowed ground
I wonder what I'm staring at
I wonder what I am...

The panes are clear
Yet all I see is gray
I thought there would be something more
To gaze at now

This dust should be choking
This darkness should be light
This headache should be over now
This nightmare should be over now

I was fucking lied to
Everything I was led to believe is wrong
My window wasn't supposed to look like this
Must be my beliefs were stained
