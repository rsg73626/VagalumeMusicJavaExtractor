ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING

Anything and everything to you (anything 
and everything), anything and everything to you (anything and everything), you're killing all my dreams and everything 
I need with all the stupid things that you do. 
When you're dieing for that special one and you're trying to make this movie ending, searching for perfection, such an imperfect world. 
And we're searching for everything, and we're searching for anything. (Anything and everything to you.) 
And every song relates to you, with all the things you do. 
So just sing this song for me. 
Just sing t his song for me, it's the only thing I need, just to hear it from your voice will make everything, ok. 
And everything's all ok, oh oh but you're so caught up in all the things you do, I want to listen to your voice. 
I know it's just another passing feeling, but I want to hold onto it this time. 
So tell me anything, because I want to know everything, so tell me anything because I want to know everything, so tell me anything because I want to know everything so tell me anything because I want to know everything
