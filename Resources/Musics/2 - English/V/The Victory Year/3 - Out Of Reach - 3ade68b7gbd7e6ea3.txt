OUT OF REACH

Well I have no explanation for this, 
I only see you every time I close my eyes. 
Is this my bad attitude that gets in your way, Or maybe we're just to far out of reach. 
And I don't know what to say to you (say to you), all my words just seem to fall your way, and maybe I'm beginning to feel a little down, as I ask myself, how's it going to be, so how's it going to be, so how's it going to be. 
Out of reach, you are out of my reach, out of reach, you are out of my reach (a little worn from the long, long day, you know I could never feel that way. 
A little worn from the long, long day, you know I could never be the same.) 
But I'll be right here, waiting for my moment, hoping to catch a glimpse, as I wonder what you're thinking. Right now.
