DRAMA STORY

Remember the best times of our lives, when everything was going so right.
Everything was special everything was cool now you hold your feelings inside. 
Everything's a drama story, everything so dull and boring to you now. 
Tripping over all the same mistakes, once again, aren't we all so cool. 
Never satisfied with anything, Once again aren't we all so cool, so cool. 
So breathe it in, and close your eyes, be the best moments of our fragile lives 
And promise me you'll give this all your best. 
You say it's just a phase a phase you're going through 
We both know nothings easy and we don't know what to do. 
You say it's just a phase a phase you're going through, 
this is the part where you feel bad (just listen, listen, to everything you know, 
listen, listen, just listen, listen and wonder what happens next, listen, listen) 
Your drama story is unfolding, your drama story is unfolding. 
Yeah, when all of your words are so unremembered and fading. 
Don't rush these things, they take a long time to discover 
I want you to know all the things inside of me. 
Remember the best times of our.
