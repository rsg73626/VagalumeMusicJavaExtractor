YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A FRIEND AGAIN

Try to make this a little more real to you.
When everything around you feels like the impossible.
But you know it all
So sing, like no one is listening to you.
So sing, like no one is listening to you.
As the years go on and on,
This is the world that you will know, 
and could this be your last time to make things all right again
You're running out of time. I never could believe anything that you say
Come to know, come to know, come to know.
Understand this, understand this.
This is all about you, this is all about you
I wish theses lines were drawn a little clearer.
I wish these lines were drawn a little clearer.
(yeah, I'm fading, yeah. I'm falling so far without, yeah. 
I'm fading yeah, I'm falling so far without you.)
You will never have a friend again.
Listen to these words, they are all meant for you, 
when all of your actions speak louder than you do. 
Listen to these words, listen to these words, you will never have a friend
