STARLIT

These hopeless thoughts about you will never go away, 
and my dreams with you in them will still remain, 
even through my foolish actions, you'll look but won't confide. 
And I'll feel so lonely this will never be applied. 
So what do you think, and where do I go from here, 
well this is fine and this is great. 
This is everything we never wanted it to be. 
Now its quarter past twelve and everything's a blur, 
wishing you were here for all I am worth. 
Right here, well take these different roads that lead different paths, 
don't look back on me, I won't look back on you
