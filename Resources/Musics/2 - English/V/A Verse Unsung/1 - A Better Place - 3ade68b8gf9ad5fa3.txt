A BETTER PLACE

You thought the worst is over,
But the worst is yet to come.
So don't leave me while I'm here,
You won't forget me while I'm gone.

We lost our ways again, back to the end.

Locked in my head for 20 days,
I'll wipe that smile right off your face.
My aggravation running high,
The guilt runs out I'm falling down.

We lost our ways again, back to the end.

So we try, we try but we lost our way.
So we try, we try but we lost our way.

A better place, awaits me with out you.
Sometimes we walk alone right back to what we know
