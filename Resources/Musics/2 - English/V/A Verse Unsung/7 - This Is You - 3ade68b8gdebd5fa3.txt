THIS IS YOU

I'm sleeping through nightmares
Awake in dreams I've never had
It feels like home
but not quite the same
And voices they scream to me
And tell me where I should belong
And I close my eyes
I wish
I wish, hope for change
Seemed so long
Cause time slips away
I give you my heart
here's my soul
here is anything
well I lost control
here's my life
tantalize
recognize
yeah this is you

come back down
reality will tear you apart
we'll find another way
we'll breathe another day
seemed so long
I'm not afraid

I give you my heart
here's my soul
here is anything
well I lost control
here's my life

recognize
yeah this is you [x4]

one step
closer yeah
one step
yeah this is you
this is you

I give you my heart
here's my soul
here is anything
well I lost control
heres my life
tantalize
recognize
yeah this is you!

here I am!
heres my soul
here is everything
waited so long
