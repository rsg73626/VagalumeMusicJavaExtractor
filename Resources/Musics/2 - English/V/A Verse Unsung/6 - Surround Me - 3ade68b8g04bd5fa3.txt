SURROUND ME

And when they all surround me,
I will not fall to my knees,
They'll take the last breath from me...
A cold comfort wraps around me.

Cell doors crash my life's a story.
One year down what more can I bleed?
Free me 'cause I'm alone ~ whoa
Tell me I'm coming home ~ whoa
Bright lights and ten fold lies,
And truth you see won't save my life.

And when they all surround me,
I will not fall to my knees,
They'll take the last breath from me...
A cold comfort wraps around me
