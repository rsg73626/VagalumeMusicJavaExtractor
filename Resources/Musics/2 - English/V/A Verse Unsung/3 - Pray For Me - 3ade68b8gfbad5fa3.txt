PRAY FOR ME

The warm breeze, 
Another day, 
I feel the sun above my head, 
I ask god, 
"Why am I here and where is all the end?"
He smiles back and tells me,
"Son don't you know you're on your own and where you go is up to you,
you better find yourself a home" 

And all the days I live my life, 
And all the days Ive grew 
Im just a sad sad soul waiting for the world to let me in 

I listen for the sound of peace but it's nowhere to be found 
I hear the voice inside me saying, 
"You better slow it down 
Cuz your lifes too fast 
Your loves too much 
Yeah. youre dying to survive 
Dont give up Im getting back the things you'll never have" 

And all the days i live my life 
And all the days Ive grown
Im just a sad sad soul waiting for hte world to let me in 

And all the days Ive lived my life 
And all the days Ive cried 
Im just a sad sad soul waiting for the 
world to let me in 

Pray for me 

Pray for me 

Pray for me 

I said pray for me 

Pray for me 

A warm breeze another day and the moon is on the rise 
I've found god, 
I've found my way, 
I see you in the end 

All the days I live my life 
And all the days Ive cried 
Im just a sad sad soul waiting for the world to let me in 

And all the days ive lived my life 
And all the days Ive cried 
Im just a sad sad soul,
Waiting for the world to let me go,
Let me go
