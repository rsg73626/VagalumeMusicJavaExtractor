COMING HOME

Baby i'm coming home, don't ask me where i've been
This road has been so long sometimes i feel i can't go on

She say's, "hey boy honey, don't make me wait"
I said, "girl don't worry, i won't be late"
I miss you babe, and i wanna know
Just if youâ€™ll stay to take me home

And every time i go i say the say damn thing

Baby i'm coming home, don't ask me where i've been
This road has been so long sometimes i feel i can't go on

I got 500 miles to go i'm late
And i still stay standing but it's in vain
I got one more reason i'm up too late
I got a hotel fever and i can't wait

And every time i go i say the say damn thing

Baby i'm coming home, don't ask me where i've been
This road has been so long sometimes i feel i can't go on
