RESOLVE TO FIGHT

Sometimes I sit and ponder
Of all the fucked up things in my life
Can't make them go away
And I'd be afraid

(Yeah Ha! Alright!)
I'll let you know how I could not survive
I finish up and walk right out the door
When every days the same
Not a dollar to my name
And they all waltz around with fantasy cars
And dollar bills waving in my face
I could careless; I'm not impressed
Cuz all your smiles are the same

I've made mistakes
Well I'm alive
This is the life for me
Until the day I die
You may be strong way down in life
But when the night is young
The strong resolve to fight

Pick up the paper, shake my hand, and roll my eyes
Turn on the television
My blood is getting thick
So I write tonight
To tell you about the things I can't explain
And I wave goodbye; I'm not standing by
To let you take control

I've made mistakes
Well I'm alive
This is the life for me
Until the day I die
You may be strong way down in life
But when the night is young
The strong resolve to fight

We carry question through the night
When all the answers are denied (x2)

Sometimes I sit and wonder
Of all the fucked up things in this life
I can't pretend I'm right
So I say its fate

Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight
The strong resolve to fight (x4)
