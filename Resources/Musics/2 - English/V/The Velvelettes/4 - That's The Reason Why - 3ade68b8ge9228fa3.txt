THAT'S THE REASON WHY

I don't believe in love on the borrow 
Here today and then gone tomorrow 
You've got to stick by me through the bad days 
It's forever, now and always 

So if you want me, go out and buy a ring 
You gotta show me before I do a thing 
Before I start to kiss you, before I start to miss you 
Before I let you take my heart 
'Cause I know a lot of guys 
They go along telling lies and breaking hearts 
They make you cry 
That's the reason why (that's the reason why)

Don't you know you got prove that your love is real 
Let the preacher close the deal 
I don't wanna take a chance 
On just a fly-by-night romance 
That's the reason why (that's the reason why)


That's the reason why (that's the reason why)

Don't you know you got prove that your love is real

On just a fly-by-night romance 
That's the reason why (that's the reason why)

Now I don't mean to be hard on you (that's the reason why, the reason why)
But baby this is what I gotta do (that's the reason why, the reason why)
You know so many guys have come around (that's the reason why, the reason why)
