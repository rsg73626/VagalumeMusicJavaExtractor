HE WAS REALLY SAYIN' SOMETHIN'

Hey hey hey

I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
With his collar unbuttoned
By my side he was struttin'

Girls, he was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin', woo
Alright now

Girls, he flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was getting low
And my feelings started to show

My heart started thumpin'
Blood pressure jumpin'

Girls, he was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin', woo
Alright, now
Hey hey yeah yeah

Hey yeah
As he walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Ladylike it may not be, no
But he moved me tremendously

Though he was bold
My heart he stole

Girls, he was really saying something
Really saying something, woo
Alright now
Oh, sing the song

Really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
