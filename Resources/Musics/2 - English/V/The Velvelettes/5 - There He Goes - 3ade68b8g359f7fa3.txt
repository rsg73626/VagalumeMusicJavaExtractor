THERE HE GOES

(There he goes) 
There he goes, the only I'm thinking of 
There he goes, the only one I'll ever love 
He has left me for no reason at all 
& he probably won't write or call 

There he goes to take his love with someone new 
What went wrong? What on earth will I do? 
He has left me; now just watch the teardrops fall 

(We had such a wonderful beginning) 
Mmmm such my last time 
(Promised "I'll love her till the ending") 
Now that he's gone, I'm 'bout to lose my mind, wo 

Look at him; he's walking away from me 
Leaving a love oh so tenderly 
There he goes & here I am all alone 
Darling, what on earth went wrong? 
Please come back, please please come back to me
