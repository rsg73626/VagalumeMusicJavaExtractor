I KNOW HIS NAME (ONLY HIS NAME)

I know his name, but what's a name? 
I can't love it, no I can't hug it 
I've got his picture, but what's a picture? 
It won't speak to me or ease my longing 
He has so many girls that he can't the find time 
No no no, even look at me, no no no no no 

I dropped my handkerchief, hoping that he would see 
But he didn't even look; he just walked on by me 
My mind tells me to make a play 
But I'm afraid that he'll never look my way 
He has so many girls that he can't the find time 
No no no, to even look at me, no no no no no 

If I had him, I wouldn't want for anything 
As long as I can wear, wear his wedding ring 
I'll stop my dreaming and start some scheming 
And I'll do anything just to make him my man 
But he has so many girls that he can't the find time 
No no no, even look at me, no no no no no 

I know his name, but what's a name 
Can't love it, can't hug it
I know his name, but what's a name 
Can't love it, can't hug it
I know his name, but what's a name 
Can't love it, can't hug it
I know his name
