HEY, THAT'S NO WAY TO SAY GOODBYE

I loved you in the mornin' with kisses deep and warm
Your head upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Many loved before us, I know we are not movin'
City and in forest, they love like me and you
Now it's gone, the distances, both of us must try
Your eyes fill with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not lookin' for another as I wander in my time
Walkin' to the corner, our steps will always line
You know my love goes with you, your love stays with me
It's just the way life changes, like the shoreline of the sea
Let's not talk of love or change things we can't untie
Your eyes fill with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye
(That's no way to say goodbye)
That's no way to say goodbye

I'm not lookin' for another as I wander in my time
Walkin' to the corner, our steps will always line
You know my love goes with you, your love stays with me
It's just the way life changes, like the shoreline of the sea
Let's not talk of love or change things we can't untie
Your eyes fill with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye
Goodbye
