FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD

Up every morning just to keep a job
I gotta fight my way through the hustling mob
Sounds of the city pounding in my brain
While another day goes down the drain (yeah, yeah)

But its a five oclock world when the whistle blows
No one owns a piece of my time
And theres a five oclock me inside my clothes
Thinking that the world looks fine, yeah

oh-de-lay-ee-ee

Trading my time for the pay I get
Living on money that I aint made yet
Ive been going trying to make my way
While I live for the end of the day (yeah, yeah)

Cuz its a five oclock world when the whistle blows
No one owns a piece of my time
Theres a long-haired girl who waits, I know
To ease my troubled mind, yeah

oh-de-lay-ee-ee

In the shelter of her arms everythings OK
When she talks then the world goes slipping away
And I know the reason I can still go on
When every other reason is gone, (yeah, yeah)

In my five oclock world she waits for me
Nothing else matters at all
Cuz every time my baby smiles at me
I know thats its all worthwhile, yeah

oh-de-lay-ee-ee
