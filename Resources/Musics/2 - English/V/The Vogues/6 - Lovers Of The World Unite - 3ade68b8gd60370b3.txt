LOVERS OF THE WORLD UNITE

Lovers of the world unite
You alone know what is right
People all should feel this way
Needing someone every day
Keep the fire of dreamers bright
Lovers of the world unite
All good people, hear my song
If you feel the world is wrong
All division, nothing shared

Dreams have died and no one cared
Seems that just the young know how
So I ask them, listen now
Lovers of the world unite
You alone know what is right
People all should feel this way
Needing someone every day
Keep the fire of dreamers bright

Lovers of the world unite
Such a pity, such a shame
Man has only he to blame
Give them beauty, give them life
He created a toil and strife
It seems that just the young know how
So I ask them, listen now
Lovers of the world unite

You alone know what is right
People all should feel this way
Needing someone every day
Keep the fire of dreamers bright
Lovers of the world unite
