TURN AROUND, LOOK AT ME

There is someone walking behind you,
Turn around, look at me.
There is someone watching your footsteps,
Turn around, look at me

There is someone who really needs you,
Here's my heart in my hand.
Turn around, look at me
Understand

That there's someone to stand beside you.
Turn around, look at me.
There's someone to love and guide you.
Turn around, look at me.

I've waited, but I'll wait forever for you to come to me.
Look at someone 
Who really loves you
Turn around, look at me
