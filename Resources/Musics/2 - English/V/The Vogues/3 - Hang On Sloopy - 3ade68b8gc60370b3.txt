HANG ON SLOOPY

Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town
And everybody, yeah, tries to put my sloopy down
Sloopy, I don't care what your daddy do
'Cause you know, sloopy, girl, I'm in love with you

And so I sing out
Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Sloopy wears a red dress, yeah, as old as the hills
But when sloopy wears that red dress
Yeah, you know, it gives me the chills, oh, oh

Sloopy, when I see you walking, walking down the street
I say, "don't worry, sloopy, girl, you belong to me"
And so I sing out
Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em right now
Sloopy, let your hair down, girl

Let it hang down on me
Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me, yeah, yeah
Come on, sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, it feels so good (come on, come on)

You know, it feels so good (come on, come on)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, yeah (come on, come on)
Oh
Hang on, sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hang on, sloopy
