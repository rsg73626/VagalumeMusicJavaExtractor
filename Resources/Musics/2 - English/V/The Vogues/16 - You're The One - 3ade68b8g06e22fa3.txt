YOU'RE THE ONE

Everytime we meet, everything is sweet
Ooh, you're so tender, I must surrender
My love is your love now and forever(Chorus)
You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of

Ooh, never leave me, please don't deceive me
I want you only, you must believe me(Chorus)I adore you and no one before you
Could make me feel this way, yeah
Since I met you, I just can't forget you
I love you more each day, yeah yeah yeah yeah(Solo)You're the one, yeah yeah yeah yeahThere may be some tears through the comin' years
Ooh, all the while I know you'll be smilin'
Your love will guide me through every mile, 'cause...(Chorus)(Fade)
