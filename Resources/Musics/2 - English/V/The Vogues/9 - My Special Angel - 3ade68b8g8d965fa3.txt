MY SPECIAL ANGEL

You are my special angel, 
Sent from up above..
The Lord smiled down on me..
And sent an angel to love..

You are my special angel..
Right from paradise..
I know that your an angel
Heaven is in your eyes...

A smile from your lips 
Brings the summer sunshine..
The tears from your eyes 
Brings the rain..
I feel your touch..
You're warm embrace..
And I'm in heaven again..

You are my special Angel
Through eternity..
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me..

You are my special Angel
Through eternity..
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me..
Here to watch over me.

angel, angel, angel......
