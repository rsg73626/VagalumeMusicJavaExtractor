LAST FLIGHT: SKY HARBOR

So do you wanna get down!?

So you think you'll make it better on your own
Sorry baby that I wasn't good enough
Wasted and falling for the years
Maybe this was just too planned
In the separation, ill just laugh, to know it's gone

This is the end, of the walls we've built tonight
Of the dreams we set on fire
And I, won't dance around this broken glass for you anymore

That girl was a pistol,
as a bullet shattered my chest,
right through the heart, of everything I used to know

As these street lights change tonight, the city falters, silent screams,
outside our second floor apartment as we said our last goodbye's

Tonight on the overpass I'm shaking, I can even feel my hands
Do you understand me baby

So say say what you need to say right now,
so say say what you need to say right now!

This is the end, of the walls we've built tonight
Of the dreams we set on fire
And I, won't dance around this broken glass for you anymore

Out on the day, I just flew in and I'm waiting for you. It's all you want
girl don't you know you've been breaking me instead.
(picture perfect, oh we're so in love)

Look back this tragic loss is sad,
(Ill be fine yeah, ill be fine yeah)
We are, we are, we are, we are

This is the end, of the walls we've built tonight
Of the dreams we set on fire
And I, won't dance around this broken glass for you anymore
As these street lights change tonight, the city falters, silent screams,
outside our second floor apartment as we said our last goodbye's.

BÃªahnk; :]
