COMPLAIN (FROM THE FILM BOB ROBERTS)

Some people must have.
Some people have not.
But theyâ€™ll complain and complain and complain and complain and complain. 

Some people will work.
Some simply will not.
But theyâ€™ll complain and complain and complain and complain and complain. 

Like this: Itâ€™s societyâ€™s fault I donâ€™t have a job.
Itâ€™s societyâ€™s fault I am a slob.
I have potential no one can see.
Give me welfare. Let me be me! 

Hey, Bud, youâ€™re livinâ€™ in the Land of the Free.
No oneâ€™s gonna hand you opportunity! 

Some people must have.
Some never will.
But theyâ€™ll complain and complain and complain and complain and complain. 

I donâ€™t have a house. I donâ€™t have a car.
I spend all my money gettingâ€™ drunk in a bar.
I wanna be rich. I donâ€™t have a brain.
Just give me a handout while I complain. 

Or this: I wanna stay in bed and watch TV.
Go out weekends in a limousine
And dance all night takinâ€™ lots of drugs
And wake up when I wanna. 

Hey, Bud, youâ€™re livinâ€™ in the Land of the Free.
No oneâ€™s gonna hand you opportunity! 

Some people will learn.
Some never do.
But theyâ€™ll complain and complain and complain and complain and complain.
Yeah, theyâ€™ll complain and complain and complain and complain and complain.
