I GUESS I'LL TAKE YOU BACK

"I Guess I'll Take You Back"

The reason that I'm calling you is to let you know I thought it through, 
and after much debate in fact I guess I'll take you back.

I've heard from friends you've moved around 
and maybe you have settled down 
so when you get this message please call me back.

It's been a rough few years for me, 
I moved back with my family, 
but I'll still take you back.

And maybe it's too late to call or maybe it's the alcohol, but I think I want you back. 
I guess I'll take you back.

I realize it's been a while you might be married or have a child. 
So give me your address and I can help you pack.

I need you worse now than before, 
I'll offer you the chance once more. 
Cuz everthing considered, guess I'll take you back.

I know that things ended bad, 
but let's stop living in the past. 
I think I want you back.

And let's forget the things we said, 
and start again with clearer heads. 
I guess I want you back. 
I guess I'll take you back.

Please don't make me ask again, 
my calling card is nearly spent. 
And life without you has been so bad. 
I don't require apologizes- just think of what I'm offering

I think I want you back. 
I guess I'll take you back.
