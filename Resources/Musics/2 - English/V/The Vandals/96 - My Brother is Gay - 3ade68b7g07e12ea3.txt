MY BROTHER IS GAY

Christmas 1994, not like the year before.
We didn't want to know.
Buried our heads in the snow...
Looking back it was obvious to everyone.
But then again he's not just anyone.
We used to laugh and call him names.
Some things I wish I could change.
Snow fell.
He was burning up inside.
Tired of living a lie.
He just had to say.
We learned my brother was gay.
It came on silent night.
Mother's face went white.
She said "I have to sit".
Father had a fit.
I'm learning to deal with it.
My brother is ggg....My brother is ggg...
Looking back it was obvious to everyone.
But then again he's not just anyone.
We used to laugh and call him names.
Some things I wish I could change.
Christmas 1994, can't take it back to the store.
Like a shirt that doesn't fit.
I'm learning to deal with it.
I'm learning to deal with it.
My brother is gay.
My brother is gay.
I guess it's OK
My brother is gay.
