I BELIEVE

I believe the children are the future,
teach them well and let them know
things may be all shit right now,
but it gets worse when your old

Happy meals and Easter bunny,
great moments indeed
Enjoy it now while you still can
cuz I believe

I believe in miracles
and dreams can come true
especially the ones
where your teeth fall out
or you're naked at school

even sleeping brings us pain
we never get no relief
But that's how it's meant to be
that's what I believe

What ever happen to trust?
come on people
It's what we need
Stop confusing the issues with facts
Cuz me for one,
I still believe

I believe in the written word
if it's on paper it's true
it's all gospel as far as I'm concerned
if somebody wrote it
it's good enough for me

why be so suspicious of the ones
who tried to keep you informed?
they give you the things you need
that's why I believe
