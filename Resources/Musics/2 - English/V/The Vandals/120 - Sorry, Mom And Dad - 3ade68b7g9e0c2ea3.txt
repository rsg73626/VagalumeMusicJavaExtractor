SORRY, MOM AND DAD

Well, you came into this world naked, screaming and covered in blood
who was there to wipe you off and give you your first hug?
And it took a couple years to figure out how to not shit in your pants
but someone was there to clean you up and powder off your rash
It's been them from the start, the ones you tortured and broke their hearts
the two that you hate- the two that you blame- the very same ones that
gave you your name

Remember the time you were five and you lied about who broke your lamp?
Who were the ones that sat you down and gave you a second chance?
It's been them from the start, the ones you tortured and broke their hearts
the two that you hate- the two that you blame- the very same ones that
gave you your name

[Chorus:]
Go home to Mom and Dad and say you're sorry,
It's the least that you can do, after all you've put them through.
Oh, come on.
Beg Mom and Dad's forgiveness, they deserve it.
Even if you don't mean it, make them believe you that it's true.
And when they offered you up all that great advise,
you just screamed "Fuck you, both- and let me live my life!
I'm gonna go out drinking with my friends have unprotected sex,
pierce my nose and get a tattoo of a dragon on my neck!"

[Chorus:]
Call Mom and Dad and finally say you're sorry,
It's the least that you can do, after all you've put them through.
Oh, come on.
Beg Mom and Dad's forgiveness, they deserve it.
Even if you don't mean it, make them believe you that it's true.
Cuz now your 35 and working in a warehouse cuz you spent your college money on cocaine.
And the shame of your existence is ever so persistent cuz you know your parents tried
and you're to blame- you're to blame, cuz

It's been the from the start, the ones you tortured and broke their hearts
the two that you hate- the two that you blame- the very same ones that
gave you your name

[Chorus:]
Go home to Mom and Dad and say your sorry,
It's the least that you can do, after all you've put them through.
Oh, come on.
Beg Mom and Dad's forgiveness, they deserve it.
Even if you don't mean it, make them believe you that it's true.
