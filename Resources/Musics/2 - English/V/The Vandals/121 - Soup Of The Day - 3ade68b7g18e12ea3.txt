SOUP OF THE DAY

Soup of the day. Flavor of the month.
Stain in your pants from your bleeding cunt.

Sell out! Buy in! Never gonna change!
Cash out now buy a home on the range.
18 years, I'm still punk.
Going back and forth you silly little fuck!

When it goes away, I still stay.
No I won't go away
never the soup of the day.

Money is good whe it comes your way.
Take it now, it's your day.
Take it, before it goes away.
Pay day! Pay day! Get out quick.
It sure beats selling your dick.

Soup of the day. Flavor of the month.
Stain in your pants from your bleeding cunt.

I had a dream, a terrible thing
like a fucking pig grabbing at a brass ring.
Gimme mine! Got mine! Constant pain
with a shotgun remove your brain.

Don't care a fuck about the flavor of the month
Soup of the day.
