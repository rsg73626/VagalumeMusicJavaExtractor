LIVE FAST, DIARRHEA

Intoxicated - the way I go through life
Inebriated - and then I pay the price
Designated drinker with a defected driver
I can't find my keys must have left them inside her
Eating Taco Bell and now I'm drinking gin and tonic

I think there's an answer but I can't put my finger on it
Mom please come pick me up I don't know where I am
It's the last think I'll ask
I just wanna live fast, diarrhea
Live fast! Diarrhea! [x3]

Punk is what it is - until you're getting paid
This is how I live, it's not a fucking phase
They don't understand, they think they're fucking rad
we should kill those guys, this is bullshit man
I followed Marshall Silver and I bootlegged Hooked on Phonics

I think there's an answer but I can't put my finger on it
Mom please come pick me up I don't know where I am
It's the last thing I'll ask
I just wanna live fast, diarrhea Live
fast! Diarrhea! [x3]
