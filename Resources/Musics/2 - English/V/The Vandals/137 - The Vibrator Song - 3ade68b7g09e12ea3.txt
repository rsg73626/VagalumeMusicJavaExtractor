THE VIBRATOR SONG

your built like r2d2 and you smell like mr ed
i cant believe the thoughts of you are still stuck 
in my head when i play nintendo in mortal combat 2
i punch katana in the face and i pretend its you


(chorous)
i know you hate punk music and even though you say
i listen to it every day i wish youd go awayaaa sex is
not a weapon sex is not a toy you should buy a vibrator
to bring yourself some joy 

cause never would ive fucked you except if i were dead
cause then i couldnt hear the stupid stories yet again
you think that your so sexy but its so fucking true
cause even if you had a brain id still be sucked in two 

(chorous x2)

that big old space between your teeth is worse than letter m
but its the space between your legs that needs to be filled in
sorry mom its not my job to pork you night and day so listen to
me when i say go the fuck away
