SO LONG, FAREWELL

there's a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall, and the bells in the steeple too. and up in the nursery an absurd little bird is popping out to say cuckoo. regretfully they tell us, but firmly they compel us to say goodnight to you. so long,farewell, auf wiedersehen, good night i hate to go and leave this pretty sight. so long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adu. adu adu to you and you and you. so long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen i'd like to stay and taste my first champagne. so long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, good bye i leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye, goodbye. i'm glad to go i can not tell a lie. i flit, i float, i fleety flee i fly. the sun has gone to bed and so must i so long farewell afedersen good bye, good bye good bye good bye
