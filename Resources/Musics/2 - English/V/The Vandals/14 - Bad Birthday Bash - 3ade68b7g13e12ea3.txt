BAD BIRTHDAY BASH

House all to myself
it was my birthday present
But total wrack'n'ruin
soon became apparent

I just wanted a band
to play my favorite song
I thought that it would be mellow
but boy was I wrong

I thought they'd played the cowboy song
(I heard it on the radio)
I thought it could be mellow
(but how could I know)

I just wanted a band
to play my favorite song
I thought that it would be mellow
but boy was I wrong

Asked to bring some friends
they walked in with mohawks
As the band began to play
they started to throw rocks

Now I thought that this was cool
til they threw me in the pool
The sofa must of missed me
cause now it sits here with me

I just wanted a band
to play my favorite song
I thought that it would be mellow
but boy was I wrong

I thought they'd played the cowboy song
(I heard it on the radio)
I thought it could be mellow
(but how could I know)

War declared on furniture
still no mercy shown
Anything not nailed
was immediately thrown

Final damage toll
is better left unspoken
By the time they left my house
there was nothing left unbroken
