ANTI

always speak my mind
the truth is what i say
i shout it out
in black and white
no smegging shades of gray
you've got to be defiant
that's what i always say
you'll never never hear my silence
but that's the price i'll pay

'cuz i'm anti-antiseptic
i'm anti-antipasto
i'm anti-anticipation
and i'm anti-antichrist

but i'm pro-prophylactic
i'm pro-propane gas
i'm pro-propaganda
and i'm por-antipathy

the future starts tomorrow
with the children of today
they'll never feel your sorrow
they stand right in your way
so take your brain out
have it washed,
that's a fact of life
but i don't mean like blair and tootie
they'd both make
a damn good wife

i'm anti-antidote
i'm anti-antiquate
i'm anti-antifreeze
i'm anti-guitar hero

i'm anti-antimatter
i'm anti-antipersonel
i'm anti-antonym
i'm anti-ann taylor

i'm anti-antibiotic
i'm anti-anticlimax
i'm anti-andrew ridgley
i'm anti-anticoagulant

i'm pro-procreation
i'm pro-programmable
i'm pro-prohibition
i'm pro-profanity

i'm anti-antitrust
i'm anti-antiknock
i'm anti-antiknock additive

i'm anti-pro choice
i'm pro-anti choice
i'm pro-propaganda
i'm proctor and gamble

i feel any more verses
to this song
would be anti-climatic
