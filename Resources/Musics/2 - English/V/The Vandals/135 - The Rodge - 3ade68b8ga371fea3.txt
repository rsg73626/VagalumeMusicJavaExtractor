THE RODGE

All you people gather round
And get together
No more sitting on your booty
party people it's your duty
you know what I mean
tell your body what to do
it's up to you 

Now let you tight pants
do a new dance
do the rodge
roger thomas is upon us
don't you fight it
do the rodge

can't you see it's so easy
it's now or never, get together
Lay it on me, Lay it down
Slap me five and gather round
the party 
is getting started
Let's act retarded,
no one is carded

Now shake your onion
Like a grunion tryin to spawn
Grab your girl unless she's Shirl
Hit the dance floor 
do the rodge

rock the rodge across the nation
A bicentennial celebration
tell two friends
and they'll tell two 
and they'll tell two and so on 
and so on
it's easy to do
tell your booty what to do
it's up to you
