WHERE'S YOUR DIGNITY

Buck up little man, you fucked up but you can't let you're life be ruined because she's over you.
Don't think about her.
Don't speak about her, again and again I tell you this as a friend.
She's gone and now you're carrying on with flowers and bad poetry.
You're sorry, but now so are we.

[Chorus:]
Where's your dignity-
it's gone just like she is.
And you're groveling about the one that got away.
You'll get no sympathy from her just crying like a baby,
like the big fat stupid baby you've become.
And what ever happened to, that guy I used to knew?
He's a weeping little ball of goo.
You're crying like you've got no spine and she's laughing at you, admit it- it's thru.

[Chorus:]
Where's your dignity-
it's gone just like she is.
And you're groveling about the one that got away.
You'll get no sympathy from her just crying like a baby,
like the big fat stupid baby you've become.
Where's your dignity?
Where's your dignity?

[Chorus:]
Where's your dignity-
it's gone just like she is.
And you're groveling about the one that got away.
You'll get no sympathy from her just crying like a baby,
like the big fat stupid baby you've become.
