LET THE BAD TIMES ROLL

For all those that are feeling way too fed up inside
Now here's a celebration of failure and losing
Like to put a shout out to all y'all far and wide
Sorry people but this is the way it's gotta be

I know, I know, I know, I know
we are pushing the parameters to a brand new low
The end is near there's lots to fear
No such thing as a good day is what I'm told
Let the bad times roll

The grass is never greener on the other side
I'll stay right here and frolic in the dirt and gravel
Where's the love in this room? I feel teary eyed.
Between you and me I don't think it's ever gonna change

Descend, rear end, offend a friend
It's wise of you to run and hide from what's around the bend
The end is near there's lots to fear
No such thing as a free lunch is what I'm told
Let the band times roll

Up to me I'll embrace them happily
let you people know I'm not foolin'
come take a ride with me down to Riverside
show you what it's like to be coolin'

Life's gotta be a little better overseas
whwre everyone's drivin' a Mercedes
unsatisfied with my mailorder bride
so much for my last attempt with the ladies

Listen to nobody this is the way I think
Tell 'em all you're gonna live at least until you're forty
Just be glad you're only one shade of blue in the face
Wake up smell the shit and think that everything is great

I know, I know, I know, I know
we are pushing the parameters to a brand new low
The end is near there's lots to fear
No such thing as a good day is what I'm told
Let the bad times roll
