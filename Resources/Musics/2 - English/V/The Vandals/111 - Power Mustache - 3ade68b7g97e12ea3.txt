POWER MUSTACHE

Mustache is a symbol of repression and of hate
Never trust a man with a butt broom on his face
It's the facial marking of the man who holds you down
The source of all your problems, every city, every town
Stalin, Hitler, Schneider, just to name a few
got to kill the mustache before it grows on you

Fight! The mustache power! [x3]
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Mustache is authority
The world is run by assholes
They try to run our lives from their golden mustache castles
The Dark Prince was a nazi, his mustache true to form
instead of arm- band swastikas, mouse ears must be worn

He terminates employees with the hair above his lip
cuz in the Fuhrer's kingdom it's dictatorship
We should take his frozen corpse and shave his fascist face
and make the magic kingdom a truly happy place

Fight! The mustache power! [x3]
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Pigs across the nation dressed in uniform
with their gun and badges, a mustache must be worn
they beat the population with their clubs inflicting pain
with mustache anonymity, they all look the same

we must join together till the mustache is removed
and then we'll have a party with beer and chicks and food.

Fight the power!
Fight the power mustache!
Fight the power!
Fight the power mustache!
