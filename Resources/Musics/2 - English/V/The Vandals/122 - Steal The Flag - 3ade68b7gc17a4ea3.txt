STEAL THE FLAG

"Steal The Flag"

Hey!
Woah!
Hey!
Woah!
Hey!
Woah!
Hey!
Woah!
Well, you see you can’t take the world and grab it by the tail.
Put it in your pocket and then you wanna watch it fail.
God damn the odds – I’m still alive, and I will thrive.
You see the winner is a man who doesn’t understand the meaning of “NO” and he always has a plan.
I’m half way there.
God dammit I will try.
Hey!
Woah!
Don’t say (Hey!) impossible (Woah!)
We’ll make (Hey!) a miracle (Woah!)
At least do (Hey!) the least you can do (Woah!)
We’ll (Hey!) do the least we can do.
They say a dream’s just a dream.
But it’s just the other team tryin’ to steal the flag, while I’m caught up in the scheme.
Put your hands on your ears and scream “God dammit I will try”
They say you can’t make an amputee dance around in glee.
You’ll never save a life with psychic surgery.
There’s power in belief.
And God Dammit I will try.
Hey!
Woah!
Don’t say (Hey!) impossible (Woah!)
We’ll make (Hey!) a miracle (Woah!)
At least do (Hey!) the least you can do (Woah!)
We’ll (Hey!) do the least we can do.
Hey! C’mon! Who let the dogs out?
Woah-oh woah-oh-ohh woah-oh you say impossible we’ll woah-oh-ohh make a miracle. 
To the sayers of nay - Get the fuck away
OK!
We’re here! Don’t fear!
Get used to it. I’m gonna try.
They say you can’ take the world and grab it by the tail, put it in your pocket, then you wanna watch it fail.
God damn the odds. I’m still alive.
Don’t say impossible.
