TASTES LIKE CHICKEN

First I think of my health,
then I know some food I have to buy
I'm taking the time, taking the time to understand
why you and me were never meant to eat a bird that fly's

How does it make you feel?
To take a life for just one meal
The deal, two drumsticks and a breast
just leave you so depressed that I must stress
Do not eat the chicken!

Now back to my health
I really don't need the vegetable
All covered in filth,
it's almost uneatable

Meat makes you strong
so strong that you can say
Who's the man? Who's the man now?
50 serving from just one cow

How does it make you feel?
To take a life for just one meal
The deal, two drumsticks and a breast
just leave you so depressed that I must stress
Do not eat the chicken!

I can taste the feathers in my mouth
Such a waste of time
1 life
1 meal should be a crime

Eat a bigger bird
1 turkey - 10 people can be served
I don't care how they're raised,
hormone injected do not phase me
You can stuff your free range chickens
I wont eat a bird that fly's

How does it make you feel?
To take a life for just one meal
The deal, two drumsticks and a breast
just leave you so depressed that I must stress
Do not eat the chicken!
