I'M THE BOSS OF ME

I won't do it- you can't fucking make me do it-
I don't wanna- Who are you to say I gotta
do anything at all man?

You're not the boss of me!
You're like "Come on!"
I'm like "No, its not my job man, gotta go-spread the word of freedom
to those of them that need it.
Who died and made you jerk?
Don't tell me to do you're work.
It's a democracy, not aristocracy.
I mean it literally
You're not the boss of me!
This is mine! Go get your own!
Why should I have to give you some of my soda pop,
I bought with my own hard earned money?
Go ahead, do it yourself.
Your arms ain't broke you don't need no help, or deserve it.
I'm not your servant.
I'll see you later- you fucking dictator
This ain't a monarchy
You're not the boss of me!
You're not the boss of me!
Cuz I'm the boss of me!
You're not the boss of me!
Cuz I'm the boss of me! Go!

I won't do it, you think you're hot shit man.
You're cold turds that hit the fan. That's right!

Who died and made you suck? Boss man you're out of luck.
This is a democracy, not aristocracy. I mean it literally,
not metaphorically-
You're not the boss of me!
