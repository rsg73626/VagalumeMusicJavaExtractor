I CAN'T WAIT

Well I know it's gonna happen so I wait for it to happen cuz it never doesn't happen to- me.
And you're giving me a headache cuz your clingy and pathetic and I know I got to cut you free.

[Chorus:]
I can't wait, can't wait there's no escaping-
I'm so over us.I can't wait, I can't take it-
just kick me in the face and go and have some stupid fun.
Well you have all this potential why must you be such a simpleminded, insecure, smothering freak.
And you'll soon be well aware there's no reason you care and I give it maybe bout a week.

[Chorus:]
I can't wait, can't wait there's no escaping-
I'm so over us.I can't wait, I can't take it-
just kick me in the face and go and have some stupid fun.
Leave the house and meet someone.
I'm sure you'll find good times with someone, anyone but me,
I won't make scene, just tell me you're leaving and I'll just act OK- I cant wait.
Well I know it's gonna happen so I wait for it to happen cuz it never doesn't happen to- me
And I want for you to want to wanna go because you think ought to.
So I can finally frigging breathe.

[Chorus:]
I can't wait, can't wait there's no escaping-
I'm so over us.I can't wait, I can't take it-
just kick me in the face and go and have some stupid fun.
Leave the house and meet someone.
Someone's sure to like you, don't tell 'em you're a psycho, in 14 years we'll go have lunch.
