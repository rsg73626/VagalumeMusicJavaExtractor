FLOWERS ARE PRETTY

Children are lovely before they get ugly, and learn to do bad stuff.
Flowers are pretty before they get shitty, and rot and turn to dust
I heard that life is a wheel and you can't make it stop
If you try it'll flatten your head
It's a circle of shit we're in the middle of it
but soon we'll all be dead

Like everybody else that ever lived before, the things you make fall to the floor
and nobody knows how hard you tried, it's been that way since the start of time-
There was a caveman that did some amazing things
but nobody here gives a fuck
And in a thousand years they'll feel the same
towards all the things you've done

[Chorus:]
So don't worry what might give you cancer-
or stay up nights just wanting answers
Its just a crap shoot, but it's mostly crap
things start off they're so terrific
they'll fuck up it's scientific
Entropy, uncertainty won't yield to you

Love at first sight on a beautiful night and a feeling so divine
gets sucked down the toilet cuz something will spoil it
with the good times left behind you
Don't try to figure out who's at fault
powerful forces abound
like a twig on a river in the universe
tomorrow you'll probably drown

[Chorus:]
So don't worry if it is a tumor -
all this will be over sooner
Its just a crap shoot, but it's mostly crap
things start off they're so terrific
they'll fuck up it's scientific
Entropy, uncertainty won't yield to you or you

And all the things that matter most
disappear, here's a toast
to erosion and corrosion, Altimzers and pain

Don't try to figure out who's at fault
there's powerful forces at play
and if you lose your legs and have to beg
it's really all the same

[Chorus:]
So don't worry what might give you cancer-
or stay up nights just wanting answers
Its just a crap shoot, but it's mostly crap
things start off they're so terrific
they'll fuck up it's scientific
Entropy, uncertainty won't yield to you, or you
