sally left me,
i was gettin' kinda cold
i left sally,
she was gettin' kinda old

oooh, oooh, what's a guy to say?

tawana don't like
the tapes a bought
boo-yah tribe,
new kids on the block
tracy says my car is dumb
i think there's more
where she came from

oooh, oooh,
what's a guy to say?
girls are turning 18 every day
