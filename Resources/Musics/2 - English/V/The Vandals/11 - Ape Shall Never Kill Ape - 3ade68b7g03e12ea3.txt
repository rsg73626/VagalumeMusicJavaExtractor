APE SHALL NEVER KILL APE

Just a grunt in a bind in his homeland
Taking orders from a very very bad man
Just yer average Dieter, Helmut, or a Bertrand
I can waste him 'cause I know I never never shook his hand

Killed by a hero, what are we supposed to do?

just a loser with a girlfriend getting fat and
participation in a very very bad plan
In a nation where the bastards are the unplanned
we can waste it cuz it's such a teeny tiny hand

Killed by procedure, what are we supposed to do

(And Cornelius says)
Ape shall never kill ape
I say wouldn't that be great?
But some apes, they just gotta go
We kill the ones that we don't know

Not a nobody, an actual American
beaten silly by another Jody Foster fan
Spend a fortune to debate the moral conflict and
He's protected through it's obvious he killed a man

Killed by the system, what are we supposed to do?
