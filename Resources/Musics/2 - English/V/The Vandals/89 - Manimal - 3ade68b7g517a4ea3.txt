MANIMAL

"Manimal"

I'm trying to be civilized and need you girl to realize, 
my higher mind runs counter to my procreative self. 
Although it's not my doing, nature has its way insuring 
that the species will be fruitful, no matter how I try to fight it.

God's the one who made me like this- understand I'm innocent. 
The drive is stronger than I am- I'm just a man, I'm just a man.

She means nothing to me, I swear. 
I'm just pulled in two directions by the male condition. 
There's no excuses, only reasons for what has brought us here. 
I need to make it clear, so you can understand. 
It's part of nature's plan. I'm just a man, I'm just a man.

It's hard to do the right thing, the hormones screaming, 
pleading- with the need to seed and no relief because there's always more. 
One hundred million daily, manufactured and ready for the journey to conception. 
Not unlike a loaded gun.

God's the one who made me like this- understand I'm innocent. 
The drive is stronger than I am- I'm just a man, I'm just a man.

She means nothing to me, I swear. 
I'm just pulled in two directions by the male condition. 
There's no excuses, only reasons for what has brought us here. 
I need to make it clear, so you can understand. 
It's part of nature's plan. I'm just a man, I'm just a man.
