DON'T MAKE ME GET MY FAT & LAZY ASS OFF THIS COUCH

"Don't Make Me Get My Fat & Lazy Ass Off This Couch"

I know it's not my fault I've been held back, under attack by parents, 
teachers, lawyers, past employers, that hold me down. 
My efforts all disgraced and criticized, thrown in my face. 
They're only joy to plot and foil my conquests, and hold me down. 
I hope they're happy now.

I blame the people who are in front of me, 
deliberatly they block me from my dreams and progress. 
I just let them win. 
And never try again.

I've never stood a chance. 
My bets laid plans we're quickly dashed by cheaters, theives and squealers- 
glory stealers, that hold me down.
I hope they're happy now.

I blame the people who are in front of me, 
deliberatly they block me from my dreams and progress. 
I just let them win. 
And never try again.

I gave it one last shot, 
they knocked me down and ripped me off again they win, I quit. 
They won't admit it, they hold me down. 
I hope they're happy now.

I blame the people who are in front of me, 
deliberatly they block me from my dreams and progress.
I just let them win. 
And never try again.
