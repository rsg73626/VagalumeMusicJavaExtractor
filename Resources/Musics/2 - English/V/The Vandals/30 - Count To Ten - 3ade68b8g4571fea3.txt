COUNT TO TEN

There’s all these angry guys
Screaming about their pain in other lives 
It seems so convincing that I am convinced they are

Full of shit just saying it, saying it
Cause they think their supposed to
Just deal with it cause everyone, everyone
Had a crappy childhood
It’s not special

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Just count to ten
Or take a yoga class
Or be a Christian 
it’s not working 
what your doing 

there once was this guy 
who went to jail for something he didn’t do
he got raped thirty times and died before the night was through 

just be glad for everything, everything
at least your legs work
Just deal with it cause everyone, everyone
Had a crappy childhood
At the very least

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Just count to ten
Or take a yoga class
Or be a Christian 
it’s not working 
what your doing 

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Just count to ten
Or take a yoga class
Or be a Christian 
It’s not working 
What you’re doing 
It’s not working 
What your doing
