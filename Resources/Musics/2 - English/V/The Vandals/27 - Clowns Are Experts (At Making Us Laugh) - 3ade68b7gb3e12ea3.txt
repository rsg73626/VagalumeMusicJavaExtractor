CLOWNS ARE EXPERTS (AT MAKING US LAUGH)

Clowns are neato clowns are fun 
Clowns are loved by everyone 
Cops n' commies even fags 
Everybody loves a gag 
Clowns everywhere are freakin' out 
In parades they scream n' shout 
They're sad as hell, and they're singin' the blues 
Cause no one laughs at their great big shoes 
Here's some clowns we really love: Bozo, Scoopy, Rusty Nails 
Here's a clown we really hate: Ronald McDonald 
(He's only in it for the burgers) 
I saw a clown in the mall today 
My brother cried and he ran away 
They get no respect, aren't served in bars 
No matter how many friends they can fit in their cars 
The other day I was drivin' around in the clown
mobile with 17 of my 
friends towin' the 
ferris wheel in the back and this cop pulls me over and says, "Where ya 
 goin' Bozo?" 
I said, "I'm not Bozo. I sure wish I was, though. The man's a friggin' 
 genius." 
Clowns are forced to take jobs across the nation 
Below the level of their education 
It's hard as hell to make ends meet 
With a painted face and gigantic feet 
Yesterday I was sittin' in a bar havin' a drink and this clown walks in and 
says,
"Bartender, give me a tree fort." The bartender looks at him and says, 
 "What's in 
a tree fort?" "Playboy books and cigars." 
Last verse same as the first Acapulco version, ten times worse
