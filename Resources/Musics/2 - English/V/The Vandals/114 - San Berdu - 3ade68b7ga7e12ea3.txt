SAN BERDU

Most girls, I can't wait for them to leave
And they're giving me the creeps by morning
Most girls, make noises in their sleep, and I hate to
watch them eat
And their boring.
You didn't rat when the lab caught fire
Throughout the Inland Empire-
You're my empresses, and I crown you
Most girls, I ben with before are fat and ugly ho's
Compared to you
Most girls, always think they're right,
but they're wrong- fucking wrong
But baby you're not like that
You understand me and it's not an act
You're my empresses, and I crown you

[Chorus:]
I wanna go with you and leave all this behind us
We'll live in San Berdo and sell the place in Cypress
Come on let's do it run away with me honey
We'll put a bunch of babies in you're tummy
And fly away:.
Most girls, I'd rather be alone and I can't answer the phone
Cuz they're scaring me
Most girls, get psycho and they're mean and they
always make a scene
And they're threatening me
The time apart didn't hurt us
And now I finished y community service
You're my empresses, and I crown you

[Chorus]

Come on let's do it run away with me honey
We'll put a bunch of babies in you're tummy
And fly away:.
All those years I was just searching
Fuck that noise, baby you're perfect
All them mean nothing cuz I found you
How did you get so awesome?
Let's spend the weekend in Laughlin
You are my empresses, I crown you
