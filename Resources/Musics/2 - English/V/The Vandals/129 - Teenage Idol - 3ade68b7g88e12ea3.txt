TEENAGE IDOL

(Chorus:)
Some people call me a teenage idol,
say they envy me;
they got no way of knowin',
how lonesome I can be.

I need somebody to be my baby,
to tell my troubles to;
got no time to find her,
cause I'm just passin' through.

(Bridge:)
I travel around from town to lonesome town,
guess all I'll be is a rollin' stone;
fortune and fame, everybody knows my name,
that won't mean a thing if I'm all alone, woah!

(Chorus)
(Bridge)
(Chorus)

I get no rest when I'm feelin' weary,
pack my bags and go;
I gotta go tomorrow,
and go and do my show.

I wanna share myself, oh,
just spread myself around with someone, anybody,
one of God's creatures-cause I'm so lonesome.
