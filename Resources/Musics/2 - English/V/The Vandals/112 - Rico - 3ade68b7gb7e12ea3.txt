RICO

I live in the land of the freeways
Home of the smog and traffic

The sun and the air
The mountains and sea
Streams and palm trees

The valleys...
The canyons...
The mountains...
The beaches...

Hollywood, downtown, the valley
Are all places you should see
The city at night, the city so bright
a short time away a campfire sight

The missions...
The mansions...
The farmlands...
Punk rock bands...

People come from all over
to work and live in the sun
It's always so nice
my own paradise

The desert, the snow
So many places to go

The people...
The places...
The weather...
The faces...

That's for me
