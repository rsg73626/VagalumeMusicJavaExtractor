COME OUT FIGHTING

Originally recorded by Pennywise,
dedicated to the memory of JasonMatthew Thirsk

Voices! You're letting voices tell you what to do
when you yourself don't know.
Voices! You got one too, so let it out
and let us know when you're feeling all alone.

Well I know,
There are times when- you're feeling close to the ground
And there's times when- you may feel there's no place to call home
And there's times when- your best friend just seems so far away
And there's times when- the only end in sight is the end

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!
Don't let it get you down.

Problems! I've got em too but keeping them inside is not the thing to do.
Problems! You've got to face hang-ups head-on, before you know they're hangin' you.

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!

All alone yes all alone. Loneliness, it is something we all know.
Woooh all alone, yes all alone. Been there before so please believe me
'cause I know.

Woooooooooh. Sorry to say to your dismay your life is not the only one that you affect.
Don't you realize that a part of all of us will die inside when you yourself are dead.

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!
Come out fighting!

Warning you, warning you, warning me.
