ELVIS DECANTER

Collecting dust inside that liquor store 'till you bought it for me
A decanter full of whiskey in the image of the King
The more I drank from it the less I saw of you
That bottle's empty now and you and I are through
When you gave me the King of gifts I didn't know what to say
Except a hundred and fifty dollars in an awful lot to pay
For a girl like you who doesn't make much money, anyway
But you cared enough to put away a little everyday
For that Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me
A fitting symbol of our love, and empty likeness of the King
If I had made it last or filled it up would it have changed a thing?
It's just an Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me
They told me I should save it, it'd be worth something 
Someday
But me I couldn't wait and the King of Rock got lighter everyday
Soon it was half empty and I was half as close to you
Then I drank the rest, and should've guessed I drank our love in two
Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me
In the name of Elvis, why did you have to leave?
When I love you and I need you desperately tonite
