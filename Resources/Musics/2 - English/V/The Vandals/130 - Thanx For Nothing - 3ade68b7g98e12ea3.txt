THANX FOR NOTHING

Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Thanx for nothing.

You shouldn't have, Oh- you didn't.
You're so generous. Thanks for nothing.
Never mind all the stuff I bought for you
It was my pleasure, getting nothing back.

Come next year I'm getting you what you got me
Fucking Nothing. See how you like it

I don't have much money but I got you something nice.
I maxed out my cards, didn't care about the price...
To show I care this time of year-
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Thanx for nothing.

So I'm a sap, under the Christmas tree.
Trying to find the gifts I thought you got for me.
But there was nothing there- what a shock.
just the torn up wrappings from all the gifts I bought.

Thanx for all the effort to brighten up my Christmas
Thank you for the knife that you stabbed me in the back with.
What a blessing. You're really something.
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Thanx for nothing.

I've been so selfless, choosing gifts so thoughtfully
Sweating in a crowed mall and you don't get shit for me.
You selfish asshole. I hope you die.
Choking on your putrid pile of presents 6 feet high

Thanx for making Christmas such a disappointment
Thanx for making sharing seem so fucking pointless
What a pal. I'll tell you one thing-
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Thanx for nothing.
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Thanx for nothing.
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
FUCK YOU!
