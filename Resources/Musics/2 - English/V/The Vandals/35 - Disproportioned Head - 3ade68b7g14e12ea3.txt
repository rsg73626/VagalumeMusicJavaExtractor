DISPROPORTIONED HEAD

If my body was twice the size it was
then I might look alright but I don't because,
I've got a disproportioned head.
And the people they point and laugh at me and
they tell me it's huge cuz honestly -
I've got a disproportioned head.
Don't try and be nice and say, "It's really not that big"
cuz I am well aware that you are lying - about my head.
It blocks out the sun like a parasol.
And I'm walking around like a Dodger doll cuz I've got a disproportioned head.
And I can't make it better with surgery.
So I'm stuck with this skull and the world can see,
I've got a disproportioned head.
Don't try and be nice to me because you think I'm near.
I'm across the street and I can't hear.
Don't offer advice to me, of hats- it's all been tried.
They don't really make them in my size...Head.
And I can only fit in convertible cars.
And my Mom has a 3-foot cesarean scar,
cuz of my disoproportioned head
And I'd go ahead and end it now
If I could find a noose that would fit around my huge, disproportioned head.
I've got a disproportioned head [x3]
