MY BRAIN TELLS MY BODY

Every time I see her sweet face makes me wanna, gotta cut my throat.
No escaping or erasing her image that haunts me and taunts me again.
But the sun it never lies, just offers warmth and fills the skies.
Says to me "it's time she went away".

[Chorus:]
My brain it tells my body, keep staring at the sun.
Till my retina's are scorched and this torture's run it's course for me.
Her ocular stimulation fuels my lust so I can't trust my eyes.
Two little traitors that wont avert.
Now they've hurt me for the last time.
But the sun it never lies, just offers warmth and fills the skies.
Says to me "it's time she went away".

[Chorus:]
My brain it tells my body, keep staring at the sun.
Till my retina's are scorched and this torture's run it's course for me.
My brain it tells my body, keep staring at the sun.
And the glow of the corona till I feel I've never known you.
But the sun it never lies, just offers warmth and fills the skies.
Says to me "it's time she went away".

[Chorus:]
My brain it tells my body, keep staring at the sun.
Till my retina's are scorched and this torture's run it's course for me.
My brain it tells my body, keep staring at the sun.
And the glow of the corona till I feel I've never known you.
