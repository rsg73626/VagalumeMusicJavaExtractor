FAILURE IS THE BEST REVENGE

For all those who've failed
you will have your day
and you'll hear them say
"I don't understand how things went wrong,
I've always been great, good-looking and strong"

When they feel like you have all the time
It's your revenge
FAILURE

I guess that's life,
failure is the best revenge

Be proud of your flounders
and falter with pride
Fail without shame
cuz you never tried

Don't bother building a trophy case,
Unless they start handing them out for last place
Be humble because no one is safe
It sneaks right up
FAILURE

Everybody join the club,
Failure is the best revenge

FAILURE

Only one way of doing things right,
but a thousand ways wrong,
so join the fight.
In showing the winners we don't play their games,
an army of losers
retarded and lame

a chance to unite
cuz we're all the same
It's great to be a
FAILURE

Never try
Failure is the best revenge

Avoid mediocrity
and run the other way
Stay at the bottom
you're welcome to stay

Make them remember you for failure without match
Every defeat is a feather in your cap.
I give a crap

We all belong
FAILURE
One billion strong
FAILURE
come join the club
FAILURE
Never try
Failure is the best revenge.
