SOCCER MOM

Gliding across the lawn, oranges and Evian.
And pizza right after the game.
Just tell me where and when,
Volvos and collagen.
Hope you might feel the same.
My Soccer mom, it's on.
Knew all along so right it's so wrong.
Pray to god that you're thinking what I'm thinking.
I know you're brattless every other weekend.
Let your hair down and keep it all a secret.
No reason why it couldn't be that way.
If you say yes right now, I'll make it work some how.
Those fancy dinners don't come free.
Don't know just where he went.
But with that settlement, you should be taking me.
My Soccer mom, it's on.
Knew all along so right it's so wrong.
Pray to god that you're thinking what I'm thinking.
I know you're brattless every other weekend.
Let your hair down and keep it all a secret.
No reason why it couldn't be that way.
Tell me I'm the one for you, even if it isn't true.
I'd pretend to like those two snot kids.
And if it had to end, I think that my heart would eventually mend.
I'd keep my fingers crossed for another MILF like you.
Pray to god that you're thinking what I'm thinking.
I know you're brattless every other weekend.
Let your hair down and keep it all a secret.
No reason why it couldn't be that way.
Tell me I'm the one for you, even if it isn't true.
I'd pretend to like those two.
I'd do anything for you my Soccer Mom.
