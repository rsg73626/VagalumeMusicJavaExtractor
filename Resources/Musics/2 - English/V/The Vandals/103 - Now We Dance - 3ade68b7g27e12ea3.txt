NOW WE DANCE

Drowning in this toilet of shit they call life
Work like hell at Taco Bell for $4.25 an hour
No one gives a squirt of piss if you fucking die
So seize the day by the balls, and squeeze until it's on it's knees

And now we dance like soldiers on the battlefield
the only triumph in a moment of glory
Crack your head open and sue somebody
Cop a feel on a punk rock girl in bondage pants
And Now We Dance

You are just a speck in a universe of turds
Silenced by conspirators, not another word.
With ozone trees depleted, you choke on malathion.
nothing fucking matters, so what's the use in tryin'?

And now we dance like warriors on the victory trail
only triumph in a moment of glory
Crack your head open and sue somebody
Come on and do push ups just like Jack Pallance
And Now We Dance

Never join the ranks of the kiss ass suit and tie
or the stinking hippie, the future is worth a lie,
nothing's worth a fuck, a fuck ain't worth a shit
we're only gonna die, here's how we deal with it

And Now We Dance like warriors on the battlefield
only triumph in a moment of glory
Crack your head open and sue somebody
Cop a feel on a punk rock girl in bondage pants
And Now We Dance

we dance like warriors on the battlefield
only triumph in a moment of glory
Crack your head open and sue somebody
Come on and do one handed push ups like Jack Pallance
And Now We Dance
