I'LL MAKE YOU LOVE ME

This here's my last chance
so it won't hurt to ask
What can I do to make you love me?

I'll learn to speak in French,
I'll even pitch a tent on your front yard
to make you love me

It seems impossible
you never seem to notice
But there will come a day
they'll say "he really showed us"

This time I really mean it
I think I'm dangerous
You won't be safe
until you love me

You're such a pretty girl,
let's feed the birds and squirrels
some bread and peanuts
till you love me.

If you don't like some one
Then I will take a gun
and blow their heads off
until you love me

You must understand
I'm not responsible for anything I do
I've got a doctor's note
this time it's not a joke,
I'm really serious
bad things will happen
till you love me.
love me
love me

I know when you say I'm scaring you
and I should go away that it's a lie
But here's some truth
I'll never stop until I die.
(die die die)

In my mind
We are peas and carrots
But you are so blind
You refuse to hear it

You'd better listen up
I'll give you one last chance
you won't be safe
until you love me,
love me,
LOVE ME
