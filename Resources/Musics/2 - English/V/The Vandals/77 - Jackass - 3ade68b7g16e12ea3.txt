JACKASS

You're on tour, I'm alone
Wonder just what you did with your phone
Try usin' it, I'm losin' it
(I) never thought I'd lose you this way

Quit the band, Get off stage
Come back home, start acting your age
Look at me, look at us
I just found out I'm not allowed on your bus

"Keep playin'. I'll stay in."
I cant' see myself sayin'
"Keep playin'. I'll stay in. I'll be OK."

[Chorus:]
Well it was cute at the party at the lake
But haulin' your gear is more than I can take
You said this little band thing wouldn't last
Guess I'm just a jackass

Stuck outside, got no pass
You happy now? You made me feel like an ass
With you up there, and me out here
Some guy told me to stay away from your beer

"Keep playin'. I'll stay in."
I cant' see myself sayin'
"Keep playin'. I'll stay in. I'll be OK."

[Chorus: x2]
