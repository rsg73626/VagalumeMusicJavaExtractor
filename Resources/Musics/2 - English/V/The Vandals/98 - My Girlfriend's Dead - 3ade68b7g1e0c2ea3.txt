MY GIRLFRIEND'S DEAD

I once had a girlfriend,
But then one day she dumped me and everywhere
I'd go people would ask me where she was.

But I don't want to talk about her.
But someone always asks about her.
So I tell them all my girlfriend's dead.

I say it's leukemia or sometimes bulimia
Or a great big truck ran her over
And chopped off her head.

But I dont' want to talk about her.
But someone always asks about her.
So I tell them all my girlfriend's dead.

I guess there's a part of me that likes the sympathy
Or the looks on thier faces when I tell themn how
She passed away.

But I dont' want to talk about her.
But someone always asks about her.
So I tell them all she's dead.

My girlfriends dead you see,
It's a total lie-but it's easier on me
Than having ot admit that she like's someone else.

My girlfriends dead you know,
Please change the subject or I am going to go
Jump off a building and join her in hell.
