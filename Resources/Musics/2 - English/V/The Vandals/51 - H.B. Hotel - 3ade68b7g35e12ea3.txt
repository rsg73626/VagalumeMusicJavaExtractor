H.B. HOTEL

Ever Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down on the end of a lonely street
called Heart Break Hotel

She left me in the gutter
with mud on my face
She left me in the gutter
a total disgrace

She took my manhood
and broke it in two
Now what's a broken
hearted man supposed to do?

Ever Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down on the end of a lonely street
called Heart Break Hotel

been so lonely, so fuckin lonely
So god damn lonely I could shit
I been so lonely, so fuckin lonely
So god damn lonely I wanna kill that bitch

cause
She was a cunt, she was a bitch
She left me with a crotch that itched
She was a cunt, she was a bitch
She left me with a crotch that itched

So I grab some pliers
pulled off her clit
Sit on her face and
make her eat my shit
Tie her up
beat her with bats
Stick her in the cellar
feed her to the rats
Poke her in the eye
fuck her in the socket
Get a dull butter knife and
cut her tit a pocket
Put a gun upto her head
make sure that fucked bitch is dead

She was a cunt, she was a bitch
She left me with a crotch that itched
She was a cunt, she was a bitch
She left me with a crotch that itched

Been so lonely, so fuckin lonely
So god damn lonely I could shit
I been so lonely, so fuckin lonely
So god damn lonely I wanna kill that bitch
