A GUN FOR CHRISTMAS

Families lock their doors in fear that criminals might get them
But this Christmas rest assured that I will have my own protection.

I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
If burgers touch my property they won't leave here with out a limp
Packing heat this Christmas I'll shoot it off on New Year's Eve,
cuz bullets go in outer space when pointed up I believe

A bullet sends a Christmas message that is clear and loud
it says that I will not take all of this bullshit lying down
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once "Stay the fuck away from my shit"

I will use my new weapon in self-defense and sport
and to keep the carolers off my god damn porch
and preventing Yuletide homicide's this year

I won't be a victim this year thanks to Santa Clause
Sleeping with no fear of danger, and it's all because
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once "Stay the fuck away from my shit"

Christmas needs security, security is weapons.
Vigilante action teaching criminals their lessons
It's the greatest gift we have taking out our rivals
Thank you Santa, thank you God
for guaranteeing my survival

A bullet sends a Christmas message that is clear and loud
it says that I will not take all of this bullshit lying down
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once "Stay the fuck away from my shit"

I won't be a victim this year thanks to Santa Clause
Sleeping with no fear of danger, and it's all because
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once "Stay the fuck away from my crap
or I'll bust a cap in your ass!!!"
