STOP SMILING

Happy robots say "life is fine"
they're the ones I loathe
they're stupid or they're lying
or a little bit of both

ignore disasters and say that life is great
it never stops the smile on your shit consuming faces

The stupid fucking hippies
too stoned to see their lives are fucked
going with the flow
into the shitter they are sucked
and then they got these magic crystals
don't do a god damn thing
just stinking of pachoulli
while they choke on their ginseng

Beating on a drum
you sing of quiet and peace,
burning marijuana
and take the time to hug a tree,
say no possessions,
but get all that you can,
you stink like shit and smile through it
Don't ever trust a happy man

Cheery retard masses,
with evil Osmond smiles
way too glad to be
cuz "He" is on your side
and then they hand out propaganda
for sheep to join the cult,
collecting guns,
they rapt your daughters
but nobody's at fault

Beating on a drum
you sing of quiet and peace,
burning marijuana
and take the time to hug a tree,
say no possessions,
but get all that you can,
you stink like shit and smile through it
Don't ever trust a happy man

I don't want to go to heaven,
it's filled with pricks like you
I won't go inside the gates,
leave me in the waiting room

I'm sure that God hates you too
he thinks your an obsessed fan
see how you are?

I'll never trust a happy man
Never trust a happy man
