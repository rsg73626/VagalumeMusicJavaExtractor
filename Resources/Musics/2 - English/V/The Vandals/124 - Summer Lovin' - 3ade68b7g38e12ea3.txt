SUMMER LOVIN'

summer lovin' had me a blast
summer lovin' happened so fast
met some girl, crazy for me
met a guy, cute as can be
summer days drifted away
to oh, the summer nights

tell me more,
was this texas or france?
tell me more,
did you get in her pants?

went to her place,
got in her blouse
while the roadies
demolished her house
watched her cable, stole her tv
she did my band
just the way she did me
summer hoes open their does
then get grounded
for the rest of their life

tell me more,
did her parents come home?
tell me more,
did you call nome on her phone?

in gay paris the girls are so chic
they don't talk english
so they last a whole week
german foxes,
way too much hair
put that wall back
so that they stay there
here's my adress
come stay with me
too bad you can't afford
to come overseas

tell me more,
did you make true love vows?
tell me more,
what if she finds your house?

i got sober that's where it ends
so i told her
we'd still be friends
she was cool,
but just like the rest
i had to leave her
with a phony address
"of course i live there,
i love you, you fox"
(your welcome anytime
at my p.o. box)

san francisco, our closing night
thought he'd finally
met mrs. right
bought her flowers,
read her my poem
said he'd call me
the next day at home
didn't answer
she's with some other dude
probably begging
out on haight street for food
