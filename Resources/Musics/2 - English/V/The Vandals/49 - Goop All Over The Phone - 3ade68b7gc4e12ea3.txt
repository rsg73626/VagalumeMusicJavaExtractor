GOOP ALL OVER THE PHONE

He met her at the soundcheck, where she was tendin' bar
Bodacious one sand ruby lips, a regular movie star
Hersingin' voice was pleasin', that's how she got her name
He wasn't from her neighborhood, but he loved herjust the same
How he wished he could move to Hollywood
How he wished he could move to Hollywood
But there's goop all over the phone, and Pleasant all over the bill
He'd like to see a lot more of her, cause she gives him such a thrill
But he's from down in Long Beach, and she lives in Hollywood Hills
So there's goop all over the phone, and Pleasant all over the bill
Like a duck after a June bug, he's on that honeybee
And every night he phones her hive and they get real sticky
He tells her that he loves her, but can only talk awhile
Cause the phone gets like a greased up hog and the bill's a country mile
(CHORUS)
Now he went off atourin', 'cause the Vandals gotta play 
But with every show their love costs more 'cause he gets further away
There's only one solution, a phony calling card
But he yapped & yapped 'till he got slapped with a serious federal charge
(CHORUS)
Now the judge denied him bail, and he fought back the tears
And he thought of Pleasant's beauty as they gave him 20 years
He said, "I'll go real peaceful like, I know I broke the law, 
But I ain't no stoop so gimme the goop
'Cause I still got one phone call."
And there's goop all over the phone...
