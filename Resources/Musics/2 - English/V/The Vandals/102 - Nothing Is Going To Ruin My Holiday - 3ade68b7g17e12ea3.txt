NOTHING IS GOING TO RUIN MY HOLIDAY

This is going to be the best Christmas ever.

Everything this year's been a disaster
But I won't let it bother me at all
Nothing's going to bring me down,
It's Christmas and I'm pleased as punch
I'm going to stand my happy ground.

I refuse to let my family make me crazy
I'll smile at their insults and their frowns
I'll ignore the shitty weather
Cuz what counts is we're together
Loving, safe and sound

Nothing's going to ruin my holiday
Not this time, Ya hear?. (I won't let it happen)
And If you try to ruin my holiday-
I swear you will regret it for the rest of the fucking year.

The turkey might have made the children vomit
The tree burned down and torched up all of our gifts
But I will grin and bear it
and this nightmare we will share it
Till I get my only wish- it's

Nothing's going to ruin my holiday
No act of God or family fight
Cuz if you try to ruin my holiday
I swear you will regret it for the rest of your fucking life
You'll burn in hell with hot pokers in your eyes and acid on your flesh

This is going to be the best Christmas ever.

Soon this crappy Christmas will be over
And I'll go right back to my pissed-off self
But until that happens I'll just continue laughing
like one of those creepy, retard, mutant, North Pole Elves.

Nothing's going to ruin my holiday
Not this year I won't let that be the case
And If you try and ruin my holiday-
I'll punch you in your fat, disgusting, turkey eating face.

Understand me
This is going to be the best Christmas ever!
