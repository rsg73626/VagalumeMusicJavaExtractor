HOW THEY GETCHA

"How They Getcha'"

Deception they lie and propaganda-ize.
They prey on weakness from the seekers of a better fucking life and bleed them dry. 
Promise and faith to fucking hook the bait till they got you where they want you 
and pull your strings and taunt you every time. 
I call shenanigans, it's Un-American lies, lies, lies. 
Someone should do something, a day of reckoning. 
It's a lie. That's how they get you.

They said they knew my fate and I'd be great and fine, 
and rich in time, stay on the line. I'm gifted and one of a kind.

Bullshit! And scammed, bamboozled, swindled, hoodwinked from a false 
and phony psychic who has robbed me and dishonored me with a crime.

I want my money back from that clairvoyant hack. 
I've seen the future and it's my foot in your ass. 
It's a lie. That's how they get you. 
It's a lie. That's how they get you.
