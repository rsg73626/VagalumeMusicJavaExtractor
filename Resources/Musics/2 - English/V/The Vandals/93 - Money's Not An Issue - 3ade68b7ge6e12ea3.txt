MONEY'S NOT AN ISSUE

Well I know you been working most nights
And I think you deserve something nice for once, you do
And the twins they've been driving you nuts
But tonight your in luck. Guess what, Here's what-

Hey Babe we're going out tonight
were finally gonna do it right
No more pinching pennies with a broke ass loser
I've had a change of luck, I found the twenty bucks
I thought I lost under the sofa
I'm feeling like a hundredaire and baby I just don't care
Where we go or what we spend
So grab your friends-cuz
Money's not a issue tonight

Hey baby were going out tonight
just bring your appetite for luxury and fun cuz
Money's not an issue
Go on baby now make a wish
I'm feeling Irish rich
I found me pot o' gold and living large, it fits you
Feel free to super size
cuz tonight dreams are realized

I know that's it's been rough
and you don't get the stuff
That such a pretty lady is so deserving of
but now that's not the case
I'll shower your sweet face with
Champagne dreams and Moustache kisses
I'm well aware that I've been kind of cheap and tight
but all that's changed and were going to do it right
so tell your friends that-
Money's not an issue tonight
