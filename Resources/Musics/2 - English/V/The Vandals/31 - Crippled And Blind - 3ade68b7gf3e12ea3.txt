CRIPPLED AND BLIND

Look at me now cuz I can't you stole my eyes
you broke my cane, you killed my dog
Running around in the black, my whole world's gone black
You turned out the light and said "goodnight"
I can't see anybody.

[Chorus 1]
I took you in, you threw me out, I helped you up, you beat me down
I hooked you up, you cut the line,
now you're swimming free and I'm crippled and blind.
Just when I learned to walk you said it wasn't fair,
you pushed me down the stairs, I'm in a wheelchair.
Pushed on my fontanel, I'm in a world of pain, you sqished my brain,
my little baby brain.

[Chorus 2]
I took you in, you threw me out, I helped you up, you beat me down
I hooked you up, you cut the line,
now you're swimming free and I'm crippled and blind I used to wanna dance now I just pee my pants,
Everything I wanted was everything I thought I had.
Now I'm just fucking crazy, how dare you call me baby,
just because I wear a diaper and I cry all the time.
Look at me now cuz I can't you stole my eyes
you broke my cane, you killed my dog. Don't fucking push me!
[Chorus 2]
