N. I. M. B. Y.

The city council met last night the vote was one to six
Denying access to our town by TV's "G.E. Smith"
The Mayor cited nightmares had by his daughter Eileen
She dreamed that ugly fucker's face popped out the friggin' screen

They said no, they said no way.
Not in my Back yard he can not stay
That eyesore is a stain upon our nation
If you think he's livin' by me there's no way

G.E. felt the set back but refusing to surrender
He bought a house disguised as the guitarist of the Pretenders
But at the party we like to throw for new homeowners
we caught him when he couldn't play the lead from "Tattooed Love Boys"

They said no, they said no way.
Not in my Back yard he can not stay
That eyesore is a stain upon our nation
If you think he's livin' by me there's no way

A man has got the right to homestead anywhere he can
but that just begs the question, What exactly is a man?
Blond Frankenstein with Dutchboy hair would hardly qualify
So we must live free of this Hall & Oats reject or die

They said no, they said no way.
Not in my Back yard he can not stay
That eyesore is a stain upon our nation
If you think he's livin' by me there's no way
