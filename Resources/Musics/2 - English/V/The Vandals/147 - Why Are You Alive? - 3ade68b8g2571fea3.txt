WHY ARE YOU ALIVE?

So you managed to get born,
But since then it's been downhill,
From the greatest expectations,
That the world might have.

You're lounging in your underwear,
Which makes your parents sad.

I don't know why some will win noble prizes,
Others will be cooking fries and
Melting til the sun it rises,
Over the neon sign that says "We never close"
I guess you'll never know,
What's your special purpose as to why you're on this earth?

One last chance to make up for your life.
Fill out your donor card and give someone your eyes.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Why are you alive,
I see you eating and you're breathing.
Always searing meet and,
One day maybe greeting.
I dont wanna kill you, but someone here might like it,
If you wont stop being an asshole,
Give your eyes to science.

Some are born with special talents,
Others find that it's a challenge
Reading, writing, living in this world that we have.
Still others have the skills and waste them,
That is twice as bad.

I dont know why, you've no ambitions,
And you never seem to listen,
To that screaming voice or reason,
That yells "You're doing it wrong".

Ask what your special purpose is,
And why you're on this earth.

One last chance to make up for your life.
Fill out your donor card and give someone your eyes.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Why are you alive,
I see you're eating and you're breathing.
Always searing meet and,
One day maybe greeting.
I dont wanna kill you, but someone here might like it,
If you wont stop being an asshole,
Give your eyes to science.

Give your eyes to science.
Give your eyes to science.
Give your eyes to science.
Give your eyes to science.

SCIENCE!!
