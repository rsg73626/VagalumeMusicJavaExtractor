SUSANVILLE

With 800 pounds on 18 wheels
After 800 miles you know how it feels
To have your rear so numb you gotta poke it
To see if it's still there
Well it's one more load to one more town
Only problem is they're all starting to sound a bit similar
Lord knows they all look the same
So I got some hot coffee in Furnace Creek
Abut the trouble is I was never neat and I spilled it
And my map and phonebook were a blur
But I had a girl and a job to do
Or was that job and a girl to do?
I don't know - I had to go and my velvet interior was a soggy mess
I think I got a girl named Mary down in Susanville
Waitin' for me to come home and make her my wife
I know I got a load of somethin' goin' to somewhereville
But I can't remember which to save to save my life
With a load to Mr. Johnson in Watsoville
Or is that a load to Mr. Watson in Johnsonville?
Well, anyway, after several days I don't know what or if it mattered
Just a load of placer to Cedarville, or a load of cedar to Placerville
Or a container full of things up to Diamond Springs for an indoor swapmeet
Is that a cargo of hay south to Northfork, Some plastic forks north to Hayfork, 
Or a bunch of men's nugget watches straight through to Pixley, 
Or Apple Jacks down to Fall River Mills or honor snacks up to Downieville?
Well, the white girls are cute that I've met in Blackbute, 
But I'll stick to the road and finish my beer and coffee
Now I am marrying Jan from Susanville
Or am I suing Jane from Mary'sville?
Cause if I am I better call Ernie my attorney from Burney Falls
Well, all I know is if I recall-
She had the longest legs and she was kinda tall
And prettier than a catfish
With its nose up against the dam 
Without a girl and some time to kill I ran some baby food to Gerberville
And took some airplane parts to Wilbur in Oreville
Now that can't be Wright
Well it's one more load one more town
Only problem is they're all startin' to sound a bit similar
Lord knows they all look the same
