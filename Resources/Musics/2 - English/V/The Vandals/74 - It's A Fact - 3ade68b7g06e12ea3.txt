IT'S A FACT

You know when your sure
that no one gives a crap,
your on the right track
It's a fact

And when you believe,
things are good
it's guaranteed
you're up your ass
It's a fact

Morons through
the world,
and it's shitty place
no one ever asked to be born
It's a fact

You know every time
you think you've got it right,
your totally wrong
It's a fact

And when you really try
the efforts misapplied
or there's a catch
It's a fact

When you've got a sure thing,
your sure to fuck it up
It's one thing you can count on every time
It's a fact

What can you do?
Absolutely nothing
don't even try to amount to something
It will never work and Hitler is a jerk,
and soon we'll all be dead anyway
It's a fact
(you suck)

In five billion years
the sun will explode
It's in the bible
It's a fact

And no one will know
that we were ever here
It's a fact
It's a fact

So rest assured in knowing
that what you do don't matter
Some one can do it better anyway
It's a fact

It's a fact
