CHRISTIAN OR CANADIAN

"Christian Or Canadian"

It couldn't be worse. From chorus to verse.
It sounds like Korn but a little bit worse.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!
On 90.7 it's bad 311.
Evidently it's a hit. But it stinks to high heaven.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!

Play the game that isn't fun, can't be ignored, 
and can't be won. Someone get me a gun.

It sounds kind of emo, or not so tight screamo.
And he keeps saying 'Him', so i'm gonna say homo.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!
He's wearing a sweater, like '98 Vedder.
But it's 2002, and the song could be better.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!

Play the game that isn't fun, can't be ignored, 
and can't be won. Someone get me a gun.

It's said that those that cannot do 
will end up teaching stuff to you, 
or some of them find God instead or better yet the border.

I cannot quite place it. It sounds like Ocasek.
But 20 years later, so you might as well face it.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!
It's so non-commitish, like light Reel Big Fish.
Or rock en Espanol, translated into English.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!

Play the game that isn't fun, can't be ignored, 
and can't be won. Someone get me a gun!
