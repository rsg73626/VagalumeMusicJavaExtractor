DIG A HOLE

"Dig A Hole"

It's a sacrilege to question and thinking is a crime, 
"Let the 'tards eat twinkies" is the mantra of our time. 
Fuck no it isn't who you are, you're only what you've bought. 
With Teletubbies teaching toddlers take it down a notch.
The glory of misinformed who never leave the couch. 
Crying when their favorite guy is voted from the house. 
The future can't be better but the childeren they won't mind, 
just give them shiny objects and tell them never try. Never try.

You think it's stupid now? 
You'll see, we're only borderline retarded compared to where we'll be. 
The future generation has their work cut out for them. 
Keep lowering the bar and dig a hole to put it in. 
Dig a hole. Dig a hole.

The dumbing down of dummies in a shameful, spinning spiral. 
With puppet masters mastering with plausible denial. 
They give us what we want, but make fuck sure we're addicted. 
To sugar coated fluffy air and guilty pleasure sickness.

We're fat and lazy mongoloids on pink electric scooters. 
With chaffing thighs we supersize and only later realize- 
we're cattle for the slaughter and laughing on the way. 
Deal with it tommorow not today, not today.

You think it's stupid now? 
You'll see, we're only borderline retarded compared to where we'll be. 
The future generation has their work cut out for them. 
Keep lowering the bar and dig a hole to put it in. 
Dig a hole. Dig a hole.

Take a pill it disapears, while loafing through our golden years. 
And pass the torch and let them sort the shit we left piled past their ears. 
Our children's children's children in the tradition of our lives 
will deal with it tommorow and never try, never try.

You think it's stupid now? 
You'll see, we're only borderline retarded compared to where we'll be. 
The future generation has their work cut out for them. 
Keep lowering the bar and dig a hole to put it in. 
Dig a hole. Dig a hole.
