TO ALL THE KIDS

To all the kids with
Headgear and braces and freckly faces (Wa-oo wa-oo)
Glasses and acne and foster care families (Wa-oo wa-oo)
Eating disorders who sit on the corners (Wa-oo wa-oo)
Bikes with a basket and pants with elastic

Retards and spastics and Star Trek fanatics (Wa-oo wa-oo)
And guys in gymnastics with lives that are tragic (Wa-oo wa-oo)
Chess club contenders with speculative genders (Wa-oo wa-oo)
Friends they imagine with matching pajamas
(God loves us all)
