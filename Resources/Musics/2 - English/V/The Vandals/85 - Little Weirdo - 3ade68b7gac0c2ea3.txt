LITTLE WEIRDO

The little weirdo down the street says he's making a rocket ship with household items,
so we can't find him.
Igloo cooler and some gasoline, soil samples and some magazines for the long ride home.

[Chorus:]
Set the controls for the farthest star and fly away.
Little weirdo.
No one here is going to miss you much but I wish you luck on your trip- run away.
Fly away, fly away.
Planet earth never offered much,
just culture shock and and a lot of strange looks from the native assholes.
Ground control there's no one there, we haven't heard a word from his interstellar patio chair.

[Chorus:]
Set the controls for the farthest star and fly away.
Little weirdo.
No one here is going to miss you much but I wish you luck on your trip- run away.
Fly away, fly away.
The little weirdo left today he said we're doomed but from his view it's so beautiful.

[Chorus:]
Set the controls for the farthest star and fly away.
Little weirdo.
No one here is going to miss you much but I wish you luck on your trip- run away.
Fly away, fly away
