PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO HELL

Some people are bad and they don't give a damn
what they do or who they hurt.
They go through their lives and don't apologize
for the shit that they've disturbed.
But they don't bother me at all cuz I know quite well
When their lives are over and they've done what they've done
They're the people that are going to hell

Some beat their wives or pull out a knife
and stab a person or two or three
with no repercussions and no one here can touch them
and they get away scott free
But that's not the case you see and I'm glad to tell
When their lives are over and they've done what they've done
They're the people that are going to hell

They will spend eternity cursing all they've done
faced with karma consequences and nowhere left to run
They will be in agony until the end of time
Cuz they were such ass holes while alive

So try and be nice and to do what's right cuz there will come a day
When you're faced with your maker and no one here can save you
No matter what they say.
And be glad that you were good cuz some don't do so well and
when their lives are over and they've done what they've done
They're the people that are going to hell
