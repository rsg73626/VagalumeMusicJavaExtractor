KICK ME

Kick me, You know that I am a lazy piece of shit
an animal on hand outs from an evil government
I've always been a nobody,
I'll never be a somebody,
unless I kick some ass or get that drink with the umbrella in it
so full of shit

Kick me, you know that my machine is full of rage
Expose me, you know I'm stupid even for my age
Please check out my shitty band, the preachings of an anarchist,
the government can't owe me if I don't believe that it exists
so full of shit

Kick me. Kick me harder
I need a good kick.
My head is so think
Kick me. Kick me harder.
Rip me a new one.
I don't even have an old one.
I'm so full of shit.

Kill me, before some moron gives me my big chance
And I end up a poet/role model buried in France
I'm so high on pot & shit
I think that I'm in Ancient Egypt
Forgive me, but Seattle's Junkies don't speak for my generation
So full of shit.
