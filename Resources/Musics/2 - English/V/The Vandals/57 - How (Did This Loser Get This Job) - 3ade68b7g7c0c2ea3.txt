HOW (DID THIS LOSER GET THIS JOB)

I know it's just a figure of speech
but if your breath and your clothes are bad
your destined to teach

I see the president
I see Lincoln
what the hell was 43% of this place thinking

we watch the shuttle launch
read J.D. Salinger
I know one teacher I wish was on the Challenger

How- How- How- How- How- How-
How did this loser get this job?

check his references,
that's all I'm saying
I think my parents deserve more
for what their paying

he works till 3:00
it's such a racket
all you need are Dockers and
a Members Only jacket

How- How- How- How- How- How-
How did this loser get this job?

unprepared,
drunk you swindle academe
all you wanna do
is wrestle with the football team

pass out towels like communion
you're protected by the kid molesters union
How- How- How- How- How- How-
How did this loser get this job?
