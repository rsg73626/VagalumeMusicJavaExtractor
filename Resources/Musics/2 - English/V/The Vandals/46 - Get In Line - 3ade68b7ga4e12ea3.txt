GET IN LINE

First you get in line.
And then you're in the line.
And then you wait in line.
And then it's almost time.
To get on to the ride
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, weee!

Get back in the line.
And then you're in the line.
And then you wait in line.
And then it's almost time.
To get back on the ride.
And then you're on the ride.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, weee!

Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, weee!

Get back in the line.
And then you're in the line.
And then you wait in line.
But someone cuts the line.
And they're adding to your time.
And that's not very nice.
Kick 'em outta line.

And then you wait in line.
And then it's almost time.
To get back on the ride.
And then you're on the ride.
Come on!
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, weee!
Get back in the line.
