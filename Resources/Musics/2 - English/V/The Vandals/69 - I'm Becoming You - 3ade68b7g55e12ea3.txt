I'M BECOMING YOU

It's not enough to say you're mine it still seems so unsatisfying.
I want to live inside your mind and wear your shoes and walk for miles.
Show up as you, do what you do, see what ensues- can we try?

[Chorus:]
I just had to explain that we are one in the same.
Help me cuz I'm becoming you.
I smell your clothes I smell your sheets and wish that smell had come from me.
I hate my skin that I live in, I never win, I just had to say-

[Chorus:]
I just had to explain that we are one in the same.
Help me cuz I'm becoming you.
Normal love you know the story, it's been done and it gets so boring.
First you meet and then you get married, squeeze out some kids and wait to be buried.
I know it sounds all crazy.
I wanna be you baby.
It's no a gay thing, I'm just stating that
I'm way all into you.
As this progresses
I'm a mess but it will all be over soon

[Chorus:]
I just had to explain that we are one in the same.
Help me cuz I'm becoming you.
I know it sounds all crazy.
I wanna be you baby.
I know it sounds all crazy.
He want's to be you baby.
I know it sounds all crazy.
He want's to be you baby
