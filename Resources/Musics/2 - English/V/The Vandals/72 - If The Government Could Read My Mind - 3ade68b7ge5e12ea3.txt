IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD READ MY MIND

Baby I'm more than a little concerned you see
about the New World Order conspiracies
And the covert spreading of deadly disease
They've got earthquake machines and UFO's
and black helicopters wherever we go
But I forget them all when you are with me
They can telepathically read my mind I'm not scared of what
they'll find - Let them do what they're gonna do
Cuz if the government can read my mind
they know I'm thinking of you.

They've got secretly funded internment camps
and biological warfare labs
But when you look at me they all don't seem so bad
They've got Martian traded technology,
and mind control psychology
I'll let them do what they wanna do
Cuz if the government can read my mind
they know I'm thinking of you.

I could stockpile food and join a militia
but I'd rather stay at home and kiss ya
Let them do what they're gonna do
Cuz if the government can read my mind
they know I'm thinking of you.

If the government can read my mind baby,
you know it doesn't matter what
they find, cuz if the government can read my mind
they know I'm thinking of you.
