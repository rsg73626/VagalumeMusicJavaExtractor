WHEN I SAY YOU, I MEAN ME

Wouldn't you like to try everything once before you had to die? Don't lie.
If there was no one watching or to ask why.
Wouldn't you like to see inside yourself and know what you could be? To be free.
Of course when I say you, I mean me.

[Chorus:]
Then your head begins to ache.
And all the plans you made just break.
For every dream you keep inside, another part of you has died.
Doesn't it make you sick?
To see everyone is such a hypocrite.
Full of shit.
Keep you down so they can benefit.
Wouldn't you like to kill, just this once to know how good it would feel.
So real.
And live your dreams with nothing to conceal.

[Chorus:]
Then your head begins to ache.
And all the plans you made just break.
When all your feelings are denied.
You'll always feel unsatisfied.
For every dream you keep inside, another part of you has died.
