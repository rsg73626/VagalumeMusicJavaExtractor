CHANGE MY PANTS (I DON'T WANNA)

I don't wanna change my pants
Not gonna change my pants
I'll Never change...

I'm on fire tonight
my pants are fitting right
Gonna rock & roll tonight, alright

I don't wanna change my pants
Not gonna change my pants
Never change...

I'm back in brown again
they are my trusted friend
You said they looked good last week
so I wore 'em again today

I don't wanna chnage my pants
Not gonna change my pants
Never change...

You can change my shirt,
you can change my mind,
but don't fuck with my pants

These pants represent a symbol of my individuality
and my belief in personal freedom, yeah

Come on I'll show you how
pants don't fail me now
wanna make sweet love to you
...pants

I don't wanna change my pants
not gonna change my pants
never change...

Every guy grab a girl
everywhere around the world
Don't change your pants,
never change your pants

It's Saturday night I'm feelin' alright
Don't change your pants,
never change your pants

Got a monkey on my back
Don't change your pants,
never change your pants

Baby [x16]
Don't change your pants
never change your pants

Throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just
Don't change your pants
never change your pants

All you sucker MC's
Don't change your pants
never change your pants

I love you
I need you
I want you
But I'm
not gonna change my pants
I'll never change my pants

You know I'm born to lose,
'cause gamblin's for fools
Don't change your pants

Walkin' down the street,
everyone I meet
Don't change your pants,
never change your pants etc.
