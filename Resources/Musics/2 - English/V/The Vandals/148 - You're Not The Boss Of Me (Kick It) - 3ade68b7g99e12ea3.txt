YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME (KICK IT)

I don't need much attention anymore
Sometimes I cringe at the thought of the things that I did before
And I don't wanna take up all your time
Sometimes I cringe at the thought of being left behind
She said "You're not the boss of me"
And I don't wanna be
Just some guy trying to be something that I'm not

[Chorus:]
Do you wanna kick it, wit me?
I wanna kick it with you
Do you wanna kick it, wit me?
I wanna kick it with you

Everyone has something for you now
And I know, well I hope that I one be one of the crowd
If you feel that I am out of line
Well I hope that you don't, but I won't wait in line
I have learned not to offer much advice
Who am I? Just a guy, like I know how to run your life
Well I guess I'll tell you who I am
I'm a man with a plan make you say goddamn
She said "You're not the boss of me"
And I don't wanna be
Just some guy trying to be something that I'm not

[Chorus x2]
And everybody's got something new to offer you
And all the wonderful things that they can do
I keep it simple- I just wanna kick it wit you
