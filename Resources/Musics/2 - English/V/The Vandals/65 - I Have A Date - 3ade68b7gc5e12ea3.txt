I HAVE A DATE

Alright

I saw this girl and she drove me wild
She looked at me and I looked and smiled
The cutest girl you could ever see
I never dreamed that she'd go out with me

We met at school so I asked her out
The only girl I ever thought about
She's sixteen and she's so devine
I never thought that I could make her mine

I'm in love, I just can't wait
Tonight I have a date
I have a date with the cutest girl in town
I have a date, and I'm the happiest boy around
I'm in love, I just can't wait
'Cause tonight I have a date

Yeah

Went to the movies in my parents car
I never dreamed that I would get that far
I picked her up at a quarter to eight
I got there early, didn't want to be late

I never dreamed it would come to this
I drove her home and she gave me a kiss
I'm in love and it's here to stay
She said she really wants to see me again

I'm in love, I just can't wait
Tonight I have a date
I have a date with the cutest girl in town
I have a date, and I'm the happiest boy around
I'm in love, I just can't wait
'Cause tonight I have a date
I have a date
I have a DATE
Yeah
I have a date

I'm in love, I just can't wait 
Because toni-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ight I have a date
I have a...date
