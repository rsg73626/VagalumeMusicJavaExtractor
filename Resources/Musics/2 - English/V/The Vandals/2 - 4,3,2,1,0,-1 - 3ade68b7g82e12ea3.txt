Stop, pretending you're even having fun
You just stand there looking dumb
and bored with your thumb in your ass:
you're better than that.
For once in your life, before you retire
be the leader of the choir set your pubic hair
on fire just because,
you feel like it

[Chorus:]
Be that moron screaming in the crowd- HEY!
This shit could never be too loud for me
Help us help you armpit fart, cuz we're only getting started...
Dance and bleed, Karate chop and pray good times will never stop.
Oh boy is this great!
Don't hesitate rub your feces like an ape,
and finally celebrate- just because.
Finally talk to a girl, throw your dream journal in the urinal cuz with tap shoes and a girdle,
dreams really can come true:
you're living proof

[Chorus:]
Be that moron screaming in the crowd- HEY!
This shit could never be too loud for me
Help us help you armpit fart, cuz we're only getting started:
Yeah, we're only getting started...
Participate, it's the end of the wait, show up late, masturbate,
tell your date you're in shape- though you're not.
Take off your shirt, eat a fistful of dirt, and never learn get sunburn,
cuz it looks good on you.

[Chorus:]
Be that moron screaming in the crowd- HEY!
This shit could never be too loud for me
Help us help you armpit fart, cuz we're only getting started:
Yeah, we're only getting started...[x2]
Dance and bleed, Karate chop and pray good times will never stop.
