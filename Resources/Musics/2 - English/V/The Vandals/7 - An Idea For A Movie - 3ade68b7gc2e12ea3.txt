AN IDEA FOR A MOVIE

I got an idea for a movie,
and it goes like this
(Check it out) It's about a boy who gets his finger caught
In a bottle of Mr. Pibb

And they go on adventures,
I think it could be big
Is it too soon to whisper Oscar?
Put a happy ending there and it'll write itself, I swear
All we need are some meetings and a lead

I got an idea for a movie,
It's about this guy
Who wished and wished 'til it came true,
And now this kid can fly

I got an idea for a movie,
and here's my pitch
I get a job and quit my band,
And you stop being a bitch

And we will have adventures,
Like the boy and his bottle did
Is it too soon to whisper Oscar?

Put a happy ending there and it'll write itself, I swear
All we need are some meetings and a lead
With a happy ending there this thing will write itself, I swear
All we need is some trick photography

I forgot one thing about the guy
Who gained the ability to fly
It was actually only for a foot or two
And only an inch or so high
