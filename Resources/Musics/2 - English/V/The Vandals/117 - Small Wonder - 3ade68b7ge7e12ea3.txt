SMALL WONDER

You know Vicky that I love you
You are programmed what to do
Is it wrong to feel this way
I could tell you what to say

But late in the evening 
when it's starting to get dark 
her light sensors 
defect to make a spark 
to set her ablaze 
with passions and desires 
She's lost control 
Only love can quench her fire

She's fantastic made of plastic 
Microchips here and there 
She's a small wonder
Love and laughter everywhere 

But once again
when the sun is going down
She becomes a menace, 
a terror of the town 
Her appetite for lust 
No man could ever know
She's not human, no Vicky
no Vicky no!
