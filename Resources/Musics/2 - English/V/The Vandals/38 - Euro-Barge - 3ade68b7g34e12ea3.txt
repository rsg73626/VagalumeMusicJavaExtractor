EURO-BARGE

Here in America, respect your fellow man
Some foreign cultures don't understand
We got this little rule and it's called elbow room
Pertaining to the spacial occupancy you consume

It I'm in front of line, then you should stay behind
Until I get my iceless soda.
It's such a simple thing it's called first come first serve
Wooden clogs that smash my feet I really don't deserve

In every region it seems there's a legion of impatient close talking slime,
that cut in line.
Barge me with your walkin' spray me with your talkin'
I am the ambassador of kick your assador

What's your affinity for my vicinity.
There's plenty room here in your country
It's just etiquette to use deodorant.
Maybe smelling bad's the way you choose to represent
Boozy and stinkin' I smell what your thinkin'
I just need a little more space Get out my face

Barge me with your walkin', spray me with your talkin'
Back the fuck up ass hole shut your bread & cheese hole
Tryin' to make myself clear, give me just a foot here
You offend my sinus, I'll kick your royal highness
I'll see your Euro-barge by friend, and raise you one Ugly American

Barge me with your walkin' spray me with your talkin'
Push you out of the way sock you in the pate'
Step right off you inbred, hygiene like a deadhead
I am the ambassador, of fuckin' kick your assador!
