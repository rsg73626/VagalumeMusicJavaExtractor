SLAP OF LOVE

[Guy:] Do you love me baby?
[Girl:] Yes
[Guy:] Well how much do you love me?
[Girl:] A whole bunch
[Guy:] Well how much is a whole bunch?
[Girl:] Well I don't know
[Guy:] This much?
[ SLAP ]

Don't say sorry
or call her baby
and if she wants to go out
say, "Maybe"
Never let her get the upper hand
A woman can't respect a weak man

And if she talks back
You just have to slap her down
Give her that slap of love
It will keep her coming around

So she ran out?
Let her pout!
She just went down to the store
You know she'll have an apology and a Sixer
when she comes through that door

She loves that stinging pain
And she knows you'll have to do it again

And if she talks back
You just have to slap her down
Give her that slap of love
It will keep her coming around

Don't feel sorry
That's a mistake
The biggest one you'll ever make

I wouldn't trust her
as far as I could throw her
You might love her
but you don't know her
Show her your love with a slap
You know that she will come back

Now your looking at the rings on your hand
And your feeling like a hell of a man
The woman now knows her place
I can see it in her rosy face

And if she talks back
You just have to slap her down
Give her that slap of love
It will keep her coming around

Show her your love with a slap
