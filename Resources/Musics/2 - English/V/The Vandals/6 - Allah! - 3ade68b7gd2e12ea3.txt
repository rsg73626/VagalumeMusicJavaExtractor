ALLAH!

Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!
I studied carefully,
and I do believe
the best of heavens is to except is Islam

I hope that book is right
they promise paradise
I'm going for the bonus
of a martyr's reward

And when I fight
I know he makes me strong
And when I die
I know I can't be wrong

I know my only chance is
Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!

The prophet has summoned us to attack
He said we must in his defense
against those who don't believe

The last day grows near
my belief takes away the fear
I made the right choice
My God's the only God

And when I fight
I know he makes me strong
And when I die
I know I can't be wrong

I know my only chance is
Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!

When the infant girl buried alive
is asked for which crime she is slain
When the records of men's deeds
are laid open and heaven is stripped bare
When hell burns fiercely and paradise is brought here
then each soul will know what it has done

It's time to party with
Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!
