CHOOSING YOU MASTERS

I think my TV's busted
if not this country's dusted
'cause I think I saw 7 Mary 3,
and they were on the MTV
They were telling the people to rock the what?

Talentless hippies, Hootie wannabees,
Southern fried kings of mediocrity

Now let me get this straight
you want MTV viewers,
the worlds biggest losers,
to vote?

the idea's wrong
in fact there ought to be a law
if you can sit through a Silverchair video
you shouldn't be allowed to vote at all

They call it a revolution, I call it a curse
Tabitha sucks and Kennedy's worse
it's like I got Clockwork Orange things on my eyelids
as I watch the fans of Stone Temple Pilots seize power

A layer of shit spreads across the land
it's a PSA from the Rollins Band
now the sellout of all time,
who can't sing or write a rhyme
is telling his Genius club
they have a voice?

Well the voice of his fans,
like those of Blind Melons
should be lumped together
w/ convicted felons
Just a segment of society
Not encouraged to engage in public policy

This idea's wrong,
in fact there ought to be a law.
Anyone who bought the last Hole record
should be thoroughly deprogrammed
for the safety of us all

This idea's wrong
don't choose your masters
