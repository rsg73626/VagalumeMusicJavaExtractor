ATROCITY

"Atrocity"

It has occured to me the reason fro my apathy, 
you think that I don't give a shit, 
it's just the opposite.

Loss of humanity, suffering, and atrocity. 
I'm gonna join the fight, lets get this party started right.

Something's always someone's problem, 
problems always never seem to end, 
sometimes they just have to end.

Front page, people full of rage. 
Trapped in their world, like monkeys in a cage. 
I'm building a bomb, I am I'm building a bomb. 
Don't cry, not like you weren't gonna die. 
If we all go at once we won't have to say goodbye. 
I'm building a bomb, I am I'm building a bomb.

I got to get me some weapons grade uranium, 
just a couple little things stand between me and my dream.

And when were dead and gone, 
no one left to carry on, 
who's first the buy the farm? 
The list is as long as my arm.

Something's always someone's problem, 
problems always never seem to end, 
sometimes they just have to end.

Front page, people full of rage. 
Trapped in their world, like monkeys in a cage. 
I'm building a bomb, I am I'm building a bomb. 
Don't cry, not like you weren't gonna die. 
If we all go at once we won't have to say goodbye. 
I'm building a bomb, I am I'm building a bomb.

BOOM.
