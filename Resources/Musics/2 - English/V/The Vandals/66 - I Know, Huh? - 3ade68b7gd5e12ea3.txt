I KNOW, HUH?

I'm an expert on her cause I see her everyday
She's got one of those bedrooms you can see from the freeway
I know her brothers, her cousins and her Dad
Would not appreciate me getting on those
Not from the same neighborhood,
Her brothers scare me but their sister looks so good

Sandra, I know, huh? You gotta' go home to
Make dinner and clean up and that sucks. I know, huh?
Sandra, I know, huh? You gotta' go home to
Fill up the pinnate for you cousin's quincenera

And when we dance, the snare drum comes out of nowhere
But we're together, and they're playing our song
'Cause when she calls, I know I just gotta' go there
And when I get her in the mood, the tuba ruins the song

I go to pick her up but I just get stared down
They say hey huero what you doin' in this town
I got a mission so I don't care what they say
They think they're something just because it's cowboy day
In their neighborhood, her brothers scare me
but their sister looks so good

Sandra, I know huh? You gotta' go home to
Put the cow stickers on Tio's van conversion
