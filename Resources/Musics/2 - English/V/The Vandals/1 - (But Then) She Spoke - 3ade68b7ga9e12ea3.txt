(BUT THEN) SHE SPOKE

There she stood
she was a vision
a picture of perfection
so I made the big decision

I'm going to talk to her
I have to show to her it could be magic
and I got the nerve up

So went over there
she was a goddess
I had to show to her I could be her Adonis
At first sight I knew she was my destiny
The first time the feeling has come over me

Intimidation, feared rejection
I need to make a love connection
then the unexpected had occurred
and then it happened

and she spoke
and it all just went to hell
her personality quickly broke the spell
so disillusioned
and I came to the conclusion
she was garbage wrapped in loveliness
leaving me so unimpressed

If she don't shut up
I'm gonna throw up
all over her shoes

How could it be?
That such a goddess would ever talk to me
and make me nauseous
All the things she said
just echoed in my head
I thought she was an angle,
but it was all just misread

Every word was terrible,
and made it more unbearable
and made me have to leave the f-ing room

and it's all because she spoke
tortured by her words
such a pretty shithead
that I wished I never heard

Perfect on the outside
but fucked on the in
how can god be so cruel?
it's got to be a sin

I had to plug my ears,
until she disappears
so I can cry - Waahh!

and it's all because she spoke
it all just went to hell
her personality quickly broke the spell
so disillusioned
that I came to the conclusion
she was garbage wrapped in loveliness
leaving me so unimpressed

I was destined to learn my lesson
and I learned it well

Never think she's perfect till you talk to her first
Never fall in love till you go through her purse
Never think she's perfect till you talk to her first
And I should know
