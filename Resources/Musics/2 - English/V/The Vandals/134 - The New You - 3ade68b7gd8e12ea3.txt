THE NEW YOU

Now you say that you like me, but you don't "like" like me.
And you say that you love me but you're not "in" love with me
And we should just be friends
but friends shouldn't treat other friends like that you're not too friendly when you act like that.

Every time I call the old you, the new you answers the phone.
I would like to talk to old you, but the new you says you're not home

Whatever happened to that girl I knew,
she was just like you- but was way more into me.
Lately you've been acting strange, or going through a phase
Why's it gotta be like that?
The old you dug me, but the new you snubs me, and asks me to go away
but I ain't going away-

Every time I call the old you, the new you answers the phone.
I would like to talk to old you, but the new you says "you're not home"

I've been so patient and I'm giving you space
I haven't called all day, but you're still not coming around
You've made a big mistake- that's not a threat
no matter how it sounds

Things were going so great, but as of late
you haven't much to say

The old you loved me, but the new you snubs me, and asks me to go away
but I ain't going away-

Every time I call the old you, the new you answers the phone.
I would like to talk to old you, but the new you says you're not home

Well now you say that you like me, but you don't "like" like me.
And you say that you love me but you're not "in" love with me
And we should just be friends- but friends shouldn't treat other friends like that
you're not too friendly when you act like that. Should I smash your fucking head
with a baseball bat? And dig around the brains and goo
for something that looks lie old you-

Every time I call the old you, the new you answers the phone.
I would like to talk to old you, but the new you says "you're not home"
you say that you like me, but you don't "like" like me....
