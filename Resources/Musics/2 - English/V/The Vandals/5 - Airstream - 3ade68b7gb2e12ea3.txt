AIRSTREAM

driving in our airstream
we're a band on the road
with equipment, roadies, a manager
we've got a heavy load

airstream! airstream! airstream!
get out of my lane!
airstream! airstream! airstream!

on our way to your town
cause you've never seen us play
with our airstream's aerodynamic design
we should be there any day

airstream! airstream! airstream!
get out of my lane!
airstream! airstream! airstream!

airstream is so shinny
and it's made out of aluminum
you can't tell if it's a '64
or an '81

I know that it's American made
So my chest just swells with pride
Then I grab that stainless steel handle
And I pull myself inside

double insulation
diamond tuck n roll
toilet, shower, refrigerator
we're completely self contained

airstream! airstream! airstream!
get out of my lane!
airstream! airstream! airstream!

airstream is so beautiful
we can hardly keep the foxes out
when we round that final corner
we can hear them shout
airstream!
