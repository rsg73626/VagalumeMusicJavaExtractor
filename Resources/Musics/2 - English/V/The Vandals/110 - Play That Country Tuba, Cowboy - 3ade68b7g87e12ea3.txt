PLAY THAT COUNTRY TUBA, COWBOY

*CHORUS*
Play that country tuba cowboy
Play that country tuba cowboy
play that country tuba, play that country tuba
play that country tuba cowboy


Well musicians stories have made the rounds about traveling bands in red-neck 
towns but for tuba players this has got to be a first
this one starts like they all do, i'd been traveling hard for a day or two and 
istoped off in this place to quench my thirst
up came this big mountain man said "what'cha got there a garbage can" an i said 
"excuse me sir but thats my tuba if you please" he said "great play a country 
song so me and my buddies can sing along" and i told him i only play in 
symphonies
Well he slamed his fist and spit out his beer and his body language made it 
very clear that this wasnt going to be just another B-flat day, so then he 
cocked his thirty-odd-six and boy i let out with some country licks that i 
never thought i'd hear my tuba play.


Play that country tuba cowboy
Play that country tuba cowboy
play that country tuba, play that country tuba
play that country tuba cowboy


About that time i ran out of air and i thouhght i'd better get outof there so i 
grabed my tuba and headed to the door, just about then i felt a lasso wraped 
around me and my tuba too and they draged me back and hollered "more man more"

Play that country tuba cowboy
Play that country tuba cowboy
play that country tuba, play that country tuba
play that country tuba cowboy
