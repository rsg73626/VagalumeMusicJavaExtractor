MY NECK, MY BACK

"My Neck, My Back"

I'm a gonna get my worker's comp check.
I'm a gonna buy you lobster food.
I'm a gonna drop some bricks on my head.
I'm a gonna be laid up for good.

My neck, my back. My neck, and my back hurt. 
I had another accident, someone tell the manegment. 
I'll be in my kiddie pool recovering.
I'll get my tools another time.
If my spine, if it ever realigns.

My neck and back they really hurt.
And I will never recover. And I will never recover. 
And I will never recover. And I will never recover.

I'm a gonna get my worker's comp check.
I'm a gonna buy you lobster food.
I'm a gonna drop some bricks on my head.
I'm a gonna be laid up for good.

Compassionate society has a whole variety of saftey nets and benefits. 
For anyone that's ever been a victim of negligence, stress, fatigue or recklessness. 
Offer me a settlement. Just offer me a settlement.

Cuz I gotta stay at home. 
My neck and back is nearly broke. 
I kind of won the lottery. 
I'll take what they are offering. 
Vicodine and Ambien and watch alot of television.

My neck and back they really hurt.
And I will never recover. And I will never recover. 
And I will never recover. And I will never recover.

I'm a gonna get my worker's comp check.
I'm a gonna buy you lobster food.
I'm a gonna drop some bricks on my head.
I'm a gonna be laid up for good.
