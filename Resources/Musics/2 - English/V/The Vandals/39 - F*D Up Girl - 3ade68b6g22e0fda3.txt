F*D UP GIRL

I'm well aware that you are chemically imbalanced
But I'm the kind of guy that likes a challenge
My crazy kind of girl who lives in her own world
Who is legally insane

I'm not afraid and I will rise to the occasion
And I'll remind you when it's time for medication
For a mixed up little girl alone in this big world
Who is legally insane

You need someone who cares
When you're losing it or delusional
You need someone to hold your hand
If you're confused at all
I understand all the problems you got
I stay up nights on a suicide watch
For you... f*d up girl...

I'll be with you until we find a good solution
And keep you out of any mental institution
You need some special care and I always will be there
Coz you're legally insane

It'll take some patience and a lot of sacrifice
Helping a lunatic get through her life
I'll protect you from yourself coz you've got nobody else
And you're legally insane

You need someone who's there
When you're losing all your faculties
You need someone who understands
All your abnormalities
I understand all the problems you got
I stay up nights on a suicide watch
For you... f*d up girl...

You need someone who cares (that's me!)
When you're losing it or delusional (you're not!)
You need someone to hold your hand
If you're confused at all (ho, ho, ho!)
I understand all the problems you got
I stay up nights on a suicide watch
For you... f*d up girl...
