HEART BREAK HOTEL

Ever since my baby left, found a new place I dwell
It's down on the end, a lonely street called Heartbrak Hotel
Left me in the gutter, mud on my face
Left me in the gutter, a total disgrace
She took my manhood and broke it in two
Now what's a broken hearted man sposed' to do?

Ever since my baby left, found a new place I dwell
It's down on the end a lonely street called heartbreak hotel

Been so lonely, so fucking lonely
So god damn lonely I could shit
I been so lonely, so fucking lonely
So god damn lonely, wanna kill that bitch cuz...

She was a cunt, she was a bitch, she left me with a cocktown hitch (x2)

Go Gonna go grab some wires, put em' around her neck
I'll sit on her face, make her eat my shit
Tie her up, feed her to the bats
Put her in the cellar, feed her to the rats...
