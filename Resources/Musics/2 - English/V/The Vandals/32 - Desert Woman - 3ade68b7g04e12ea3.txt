DESERT WOMAN

A thousand miles of desert- a million tons of sand
A few less pounds of woman- a tired broken man
A parching thrist that water couldn't quench
My desert woman this frontier's only pearl
How can I penetrate her lonely desert world?
She doesn't need no make up- the sun powders her nose
Natural, unshaven from her armpits to her toes
A love as empty as a broken neon sign
Only thing in common was her Levi's size and mine
Now the desert shows no mercy to the timid or the weak
So as she left the diner, I climbed into her jeep
She did the rest, introduced me to this land
Now she's my desert woman and I'm her desert man
Like the lone coyote from this land I'll never stray
A pound of Sioux peyote couldn't make me feel that way
