WANNA BE MANOR

You can tell I'm no great planner
I ended up at the wanna be manor
wanna be manor, what a place to be
wanna be manor, it's not for me

I looked in the door, opened the door
peeed on the floor, spotted a whore
drugs and filth are all around
no clean dishes can be found

if you thought that your nightmares were scary
wait till you meet the hoe called jerri
no one dragged a dead fish in the room
it's spreading legs and her female perfume

I walked upstairs, I can't explain
but I got involved in a three man train
was it fun? Yeah, I guess
but I got crabs like all the rest

Dave's a cool guy but he's a really a slob
lives on unemployment, and he can't get a job
go ahead and take a drink, there's nothing to fear
just make sure you sniff that beer!

Passing out is no excuse
you'll be subject to abuse
some will let you hang there
It's just the pigs on their nightly visit

After busting one person each
the pigs said to move out of huntington beach
now I'll have to find a new town
or find another wanna be manor

wanna be manor
You can tell I'm no great planner
I ended up at the wanna be manor
wanna be manor, what a place to be
wanna be manor, it's not for me

wanna be manor
wanna be manor
