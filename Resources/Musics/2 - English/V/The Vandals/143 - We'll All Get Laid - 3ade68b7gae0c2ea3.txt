WE'LL ALL GET LAID

Well it's a great big world that's filled with disappointment.
We're maggots in the ointment just squirming to get free.
And now the futures gotmuch more than you can handle.
Don't try to light a candle.Let's curse the misery.
And as we head for certain doom, don't give up so soon.
Till every one of us is dead and vengeful Armageddon has arrived.

[Chorus:]
Cuz we'll have a drink and throw a parade.
And greet the rapture screaming "Hoary!"
And hope someone jumps on the grenade.
But no one will.
We'll all be killed and we will thrill as blood is spilled.
And even the bravest of us run away.
We'll all get laid.
Cuz you still got dreams that haven't been pissed on.
And you still got things you'll never get done.
And you'll keep on running like a rat on a wheel.
And keep on wondering what is the deal.
What was the point? And how come it ends this way?
Well no one knows, we've only got today.
And as the lights go dim, don't think it's all so grim.
At least we all go out together heading off to never-never land.

[Chorus:]
Cuz we'll have a drink and throw a parade.
And greet the rapture screaming "Hoary!"
And hope someone jumps on the grenade.
But no one will.
We'll all be killed and we will thrill as blood is spilled.
And even the bravest of us run away.
We'll all get laid [x2]
