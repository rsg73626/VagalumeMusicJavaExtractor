PIRATE'S LIFE

Seven hits of L
and nobody could tell
So I spent every dime
just to get to Aniehem

I was in the Magic Kingdom
Now I'm in the Carribean
You get something really wicked
when you spend an E-ticket

High adventure on the sea,
but it's not the life for me
Now those harry tatooed pirates are all chasing after me
I was threatened with a knife by a pirate playing fife
Now I'm sailing for my life thanks to LSD 25

Where can I hide?
I don't want to buy a bride
I'm alone as I float
Hey, there were others in my boat

Up ahead, one of the men
he said he would be my friend
He'd guide me to the hole
If I deeded him my soul

To the hole I didn't make it
That doesn't mean he didn't take it
He laughed at my plight
He said you'll be one of us tonight

High adventure on the sea,
but it's not the life for me
Now those harry tatooed pirates are all chasing after me
I was threatened with a knife by a pirate playing fife
Now I'm sailing for my life thanks to LSD 25

He was right, I'm still here
as I have been, for over a year
With my last bit of hope,
a tin can and rope
I just want to break free

But I can't get away
No I can't get away
cause that damn dog's got the key
No one listens as I tell
of my ordeal in this cell

They stand right by
but they don't fell
Is this for real?
Is this for real!
