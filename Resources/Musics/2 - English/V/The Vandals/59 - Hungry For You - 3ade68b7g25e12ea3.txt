HUNGRY FOR YOU

Hey baby
where you going tonight?
And are you taking me with you?

I love you so much
I want you to know
I really love you so
I want you to be my lady forever
and ever and ever and ever

Little girl
I want you
so bad I can taste it in my food

I think your great
I really want you to know
I always want you around

I think about you every single night
when I'm sleeping on the couch
in my bed
Every time I watch TV
all I have
I got you in my head
All I think is of you

I love you
I fuckin love you,
your my Pumpkin
and I want to squeeze you

So baby
where we going out tonight?
Are you taking me to get some food?

I want you to pay for me
I've got no job
I'm so hungry for you
for you
for you

Hey baby
where we going out tonight?
Are we gonna go eat?
Everything will be alright

I love you so much I want you to know
I never really ever wanna let you go,
you're my Pumpkin for 6 weeks now
and all I want to share is a large cow,
with cheese, with you,
because I love you

Oh Pumpkin!
I want you
I want you to know,
I never really ever wanna let you go

I'll smash your head in the doorway,
If you don't pay my way
I got no money, I got no rent,
I'm just hungry for you

I'm just hungry for you
I'm so hungry for you
Hungry for you!
Hungry for you!
