APPRECIATE MY HONESTY

I used to take you out nearly every night.
Acting interested in everything you like.
Painfully pretending you we're everything I wanted.

[Chorus:]
Now I've gotten comfortable enough to be a whole lot more like me around you-
Please appreciate my honesty.
I'm so glad that I can lay around, hand in pants without a chance of disappointing you.
Never listening, or helping except for a critique or two.

[Chorus:]
Now I've gotten comfortable enough to be a whole lot more like me around you-
Please appreciate my honesty.
Appreciate my honesty I'm so happy that we've gotten past the lies.
If you don't believe me start again with any other guy.
They'll be nice and really try but soon like me they'll realize: that it's a lie.
Over time I've let myself go.
But I'm not going to let you go unless you want to go and pick me up some food or something nice.

[Chorus:]
Now I've gotten comfortable enough to be a whole lot more like me around you-
Please appreciate my honesty.
Now I've gotten comfortable enough to be a whole lot more like me around you-
Please appreciate my honesty.
Appreciate my honesty.
