THE EIFFEL TOWER AND THE BT TOWER

I remember when I first realised why I'd do anything for you.
Like if you needed something reached, that I couldn't reach,
I'd unravel my favourite jumper just to make a lasso.

And like when you said that you loved the songs of the 
Pet Shop Boys,
But hate the way they sound,
So I played them all out for you on just guitar and kazoo.

And whether we're in Paris or the midlands
I overdo it every time,
Like a tv chef adding too much seasoning.

But at first I tried to keep it to myself what I'd found,
But now I'm wearing my sandwich board around town
With my name and your name inside a heart shape,
And though I don't get work anymore,
I don't care.
Cause I've found a girl I can't ignore.

I remember the first time I realised what first I'd lied to you,
About what books I'd read and Dvds I owned
Just to make me seem more like you,
And worth hanging on to.

But now we call it coincidence,
That all the books that I'd actually read
All had a film version that I'd seen before 
I knew there was a book around.

That time that I'm with you,
That I just can't hide the sound,
Of my heart beating louder than a ghetto blaster

But at first I tried to keep it to myself what I'd found,
But now I'm wearing my sandwich board around town
With my name and your name inside a heart shape,
And though I don't get work anymore,
I don't care.
Cause I've found a girl I can't ignore anymore.
