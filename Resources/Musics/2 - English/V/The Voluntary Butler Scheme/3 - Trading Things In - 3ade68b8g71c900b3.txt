TRADING THINGS IN

If I were to trade my jumbo jet
In for a paper plane
Maybe you'd tell me you feel the same
(Maybe you'd tell me you feel the same)

And if you were broccoli I'd turn
Vegetarian for you (Vegetarian for you)
And if you bought running shoes
As out of breath as I'd get, I'd buy running shoes, too.

I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone else."

When I buy my barge, will you come and be in charge
Of how often the kettle gets boiled?
'Cause just like coffee and tea, I need you regularly
('Cause just like coffee and tea, I need you regularly)

We can listen to 'La Bamba' on your mp3 player
(Yes, we can listen to 'La Bamba' on your mp3 player)
And I'll tell you all I know
About putting shelf upon shelf upon shelf upon shelf

I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone else."


I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone,"
I said, "Baby, don't go for anyone else."
