SLEEPING ON TOP OF THINGS

If I thought you'd take it seriously, oh I'd sing it from a mountain,
If I thought you'd take it seriously, oh I'd sing it in the rain,
If I thought you'd take it seriously, I'd sing it time and time again.

Tell me these bad times will come to an end.
Tell me these quiet times are gonna get louder,
And I'll listen out for them.

I'd sleep on top of my piano,
I'd sleep on top of my roof.
But if that don't give you the proof you need,
Then you need too much
