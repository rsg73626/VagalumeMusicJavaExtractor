BELMORE ST

Pretty girls are keepers
Shady men are creeping down town
Caimed as one of those guys
Smashing bottles and flicking off cars
It makes me mad to think of what I could doing
I think to much I'll never do it anyway
Flickered lamp all though the night
It's just my head I've drank too much again
It sounds so soothing to hear that sound
Lock me in a glass jar nowhere to be found
I've been here before, I've been here before
I've been here before, I've been here before

Repetition of the same old shit
You're scraping at my bones irritation to my skin
I've been here before, I've been here before
I've been here before, I've been here before
And I'd cut the fine lines, open my caged mind
Just to be with you, just to be with you
The things that I have done
The man that I've become it's also true
I need a solution not just a clue

On belmore street, it's the way to blame
Oh I'm not here to listen, well I'm not here to stay
I can't stand the same routine, working hard all day
It's leaving no time in between
Oh I need to find a way
I need a solution not just a clue
So please stay, stay with me and I'll stay with you

It sounds so soothing to hear that sound
Lock me in a glass jar nowhere to be found
I've been here before, I've been here before
I've been here before, I've been here before
Repetition of the same old shit
You're scraping at my bones irritation to my skin
I've been here before, I've been here before
I've been here before, I've been here before

And I'd cut the fine lines
Open my caged mind, just to be with you
Just to be with you
Put together the pieces, no solutions just clues
Oh I need to find a way
I need a solution not just a clue, so please stay
Stay with me and I'll stay with you

It sounds so soothing to hear that sound
Lock me in a glass jar nowhere to be found
I've been here before, I've been here before
I've been here before, I've been here before
Repetition of the same old shit
You're scraping at my bones irritation to my skin
I've been here before, I've been here before
I've been here before, I've been here before
