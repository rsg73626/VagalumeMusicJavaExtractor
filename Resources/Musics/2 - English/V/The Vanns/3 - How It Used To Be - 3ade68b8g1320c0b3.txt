HOW IT USED TO BE

Called up late and it's on my mind
You got me waiting, waiting
waiting for this night to roll over again

And I say oh oh oh let me tell you just how it's going to be
I'm here to get washed up and feel happy
until I know that I can't see
I'm falling for the same old faults
The effect it makes on you just ain't worth it all
ain't worth it all

Just to find out what you want
Throw my mind out until I can't see
Try to make you just walk on home
Take me back to how I used to be

I'm feeling cold and I know that I left you
and we can't stand still
It's running through my mind that what I've done is real
And all my love is gone

And I say oh oh oh let me tell you just how it's going to be
I'm here to get washed up
and feel happy until I know that I can't see
I'm falling for the same old faults
The effect it makes on you just ain't worth it all

Ain't worth it all
These effects on you, ain't worth it all

Just to find out what you want
Throw you mind out until I can't see
Try to make you just walk on home
Take me back to how I used to be
