DON'T HOLD ME BACK

Weighted arms, catch your feel now
Hanging by a white laced thread
Spaceless minds through the crowd now

Your fabricated lies won't bring me down

City grass is growing fast
Step towards the future and push away your past
Moving slow just follow the beat now you call this music
I call this a catastrophe

Don't hold me back
Don't hold me back
Don't hold me back

Moving fast, sunken fears
We don't care for what they say
Burning light through our hearts
Sitting here alone the days just fade

City grass is growing fast
Step towards the future and push away your past
Moving slow just follow the beat now you call this music
I call this a catastrophe

Don't hold me back
Don't hold me back
Don't hold me back
