SOMEHOW

By Dave Fenton

I've seen it before
I know the score
You're trying to be wild and carefree 
You really can't take it no more

I'm trying to think 
I can't think clear 
Everybody's talking to me 
It's gone foggy in here

But as time goes marching home again 
It leaves me to reflect
Or was this just a waste of time 
Or was this time well spent

And if it marches back again 
And orders me to smile 
Then will I be prepared 
Or will it take a little while

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

I've listened to you
Please listen to me 
Don't tie us up completely 
Just wait and see

I'll try very hard for a second chance 
Which is it to be? One dead romance 
Or a handful of dreams? Please tell me 
It makes all the difference to me 
And I really want to know

I've done so many things I suddenly regret
If  I could only compromise and you'd try to forget 
A single kiss, a lovers wish, the past dissolves in tears 
The present burns inside of me, the future disappears

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Oh Yes I will and I'll go 
Out of my way to make you happy 
Till the sun don't shine and sky stops turning blue

I really want to know 
Could I ever be happy
Without somebody who really cared
Somebody like you

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Yes I will
