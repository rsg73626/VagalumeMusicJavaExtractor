SIXTY SECOND INTERVAL

By Dave Fenton

The moon is up 
It's grey tonight 
And the stars on the battlefield shiver in tears
A dead bright lesson from a million light years

The game is up It's cold tonight 
So we crouch in our overcoats waiting for a dawn 
Both hungry and simple and calm and warm

Sixty second interval 
Here it comes 
Sixty seconds, in to view

They're out tonight 
The masks are down 
And friends meet strangers and strangers are friends 
And pain is passion and passion must end

They're here tonight 
No fear tonight 
And the hands on the faces have started to move 
It's slow at first but it's over too soon

Sixty second interval 
Here it comes 
Sixty seconds, in to view

They're here tonight 
No fear tonight 
And the hands on the faces have started to move 
It's slow at first but it's over too soon

Sixty second interval 
Here it comes 
Sixty second interval 
Here it comes 
Here it comes 
Here it comes
