GALLERIES FOR GUNS

By Dave Fenton

How you gonna keep me warm, now that the whole world's chloroformed 
Well maybe it's the time of year, or maybe the calm before the storm 
Oh we missed some show on the BBC 
And we all gave up except for You and me 
We sit here playing with snakes on a board 
Talking about holidays over the wall 
With the moonligth playing games around your eyes 
You look like ice and almost hypnotised 
But there ain't no rules to keep us apart 
Just one for the head and one for the heart 
Of the target man, target man, target man, target man 
Aim at me 
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it 
This is all I need 
'Cos I say, galleries for guns 
Seem like no exchange at all 
But I can give you armour if You keep me warm

People can be awful slow, or maybe they just don't want to know 
But I'll stay with you if You'll stay with me 
And I'll give you all that You'll ever need 
Those butterfly boys may look very neat 
But they never stay long and they never stay sweet
The moonlight's playing games around your eyes
You look like ice and almost hypnotised 
But there ain't no rules to keep us apart 
Just one for the head and one for the heart 
Of the target man, target man, target man, target man 
Aim at me 
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it 
This is all I need

'Cos I say, galleries for guns
Seem like no exchange at all 
But I can give you armour if You keep me warm

How you gonna keep me warm 
How you gonna keep me warm 
How you gonna keep me warm

Now that the whole world's chloroformed 
Oh we missed some show on the BBC
And we all gave up except for You and me 
We sit here playing with snakes on a board 
Talking about holidays over the wall 
With the moonligth playing games around your eyes 
You look like ice and almost hypnotised 
But there ain't no rules to keep us apart 
Just one for the head and one for the heart 
Of the target man, target man, target man, target man 
Aim at me 
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it 
This is all I need

'Cos I say, galleries for guns 
Seem like no exchange at all 
But I can give you armour if You keep me warm
