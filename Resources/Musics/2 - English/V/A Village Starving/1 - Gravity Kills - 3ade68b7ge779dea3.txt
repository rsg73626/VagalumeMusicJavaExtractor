GRAVITY KILLS

So i take your percious word
Lay it next to mine
Will they collide or will gravity draw
Them closer into that moment for
The perfect kiss but it is gravity
For your world i see eyes full of stars
So innocent your world is so presious
As i gaze from mine into yours
I wish upon a star that until the day
My world pulls with gravity
So strong or the day you discover me
Is what my gravity strives for
And you world attracts so until
The day the sun raises to become one
With your sky i remain
Forever distant
