SUICIDE CLUB

damn’ right you’re pissed
it’s all so fucking absurd
damn’ right you’re angry
you’ve been so stupidly hurt
damn’ right your sad
feel like you lost all that you never had
damn’ right your cold
all your life just waiting to be old
if life throws its fists at you
please try to stay beautiful
spit the blood back
and flash a warm red smile
(this club is not optional)
you’ve always been a member of the suicide club
