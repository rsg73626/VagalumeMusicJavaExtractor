THE SMILE ON THOSE DAGGERS

She talked back. She said no.
She learned so very quickly how to say no.
She packed her little bag and shes on the go.
Shes been asking whats the price of meat these days.
Whats the price of me?
Shes pointing middle fingers now.
Shes spiting back at the city.
He got it bad its damn good.
Got himself a brand new box of matches
Just imagine the possibilities
Got himself a brand new box of matches
Just wait and see what hell do to this city.
Hes gonna burn this place down, baby right down
Hes gonna be the coolest kid in town
Hes gonna burn this place down, baby write it down
The only way is up when your backs to the ground
Boys. Girls. Boys. Girls.
Boys will be boys. Girls wanna have fun.
We gonna start a fire. Yeah! we gonna get burned.
Girls will be girls. Boys wanna have fun.
We gonna start a fire . Yeah! we gonna get burned
We got mixed up, confused, yes weve been bamboozled.
We got beaten, bruised, yes weve been fucked good.
Were a generation of cinderellas and no slipper on the way.
We wanna rape you back.
