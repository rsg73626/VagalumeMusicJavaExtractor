BAD MIRROR

All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on me now
Who am I, Who am I, Who am I trying to be now?
Don’t touch me, Don’t touch me, Don’t touch me. I don’t feel good.
Just shut up, Just shut up, Just shut up, Shut up and love me, Shut up and love me.


We got enough self esteem to have no self esteem.
We’re all ugly.                                                           (4x)


I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna break that mirror.
I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna break that mirror.
I should’ve, I should’ve I should’ve, I should’ve break that mirror.
It wouldn’ve, It wouldn’ve, It wouldn’ve, It wouldn’ve break me.


We got enough self esteem to have no self esteem.          (4x)
There’s nothing beautiful here
We’re all ugly.
