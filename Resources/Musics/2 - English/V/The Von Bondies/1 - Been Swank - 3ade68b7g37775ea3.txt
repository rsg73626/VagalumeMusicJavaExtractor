BEEN SWANK

I've been set up like the innocent.
I've been swank
and I'm lovin' it.

I've been alone like a little kid.
I've been swank
and I'm lovin' it.

I've been swank
and lovin' it.

Oh no - it's a sin! The Jury's in.
Doesn't look like I'll be doin' it again.
Cause I've been swank
been swank - and lovin' it.

I've been swank
and lovin' it.

The nights are cold
the nights are long.
I'm alone and I've been alone all along.
I've been set-up like the innocent.
I've been swank
and lovin' it.

I've been swank
and lovin' it.

I've been swank...and lovin' it
