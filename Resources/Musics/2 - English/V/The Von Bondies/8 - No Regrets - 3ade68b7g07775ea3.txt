NO REGRETS

You feel buried, you feel bored
no one takes u seriously when ur 24
So shut off ur days
and turn on ur nights
'cause the chance is for the taking
and the taking's right

No you really haven't lived life yet
No you really haven't lived life
If you ain't got no regrets

What I did last night
is none of your concern
You know I feel right
but that's none of your concern

No you really haven't lived life yet
No you really haven't lived life yet
If you ain't got no regrets
If you ain't got no regrets
Don't be mistaken
for someone who cares
Oh no, Oh no you wouldn't dare
Your the path here,
the pawn i took,
the sacrificial lamb,
the spineless book

Oh no you really haven't lived life yet
Oh no you really haven't lived life yet
If you ain't got no regrets
If you ain't got no regrets
