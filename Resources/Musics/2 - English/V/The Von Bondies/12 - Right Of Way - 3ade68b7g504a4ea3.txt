RIGHT OF WAY

I've been hanging around this place too long
I get satisfied and then I'm gone
You break me down and then you treat me low
Like a love you won't bestow
On me (x2)

These feelings I have can't be wrong
The signs say - 
I've got the right of way

Self-destruction is my destination
This is how it pains my days
With mixed emotions - even lies
You make me break all ties to these ways
You lay this guilt on me
On me (x3)

These feelings I have can't be wrong
The signs say -
I've got the right of way

You take me seriously when I'm playing the part
Oh, the man with the shattered start
You break me down and then you treat me low
Like the love you won't bestow
On me (x4)

These feelings I have can't be wrong
The signs say -
I've got the right of way

You've got to break it, break it to me
You got to break it to me easy
(repeat and fade to end)
