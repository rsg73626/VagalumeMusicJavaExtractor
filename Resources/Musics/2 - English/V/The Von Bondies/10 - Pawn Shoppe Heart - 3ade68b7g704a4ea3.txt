PAWN SHOPPE HEART

I found my heart
In a pawn shop, baby
You took me for dead - dead
By the words that you said
I am way past tense
I'm borderline crazy
You took all my good love
And gave it all away

I've been on the backstreet
I'm all alone
I've been on the hotseat
I'm gone - I'm gone
Sweet little love of mine
Take all you can
I'm your pawn shop lover
I'm your pawn shop, broken-heart man

With all your good looks
I still have nothing
Breaking the whip on my back like a man
Still have nothing
Take everything you want
Take all you can
I'm your pawn shop lover
I'm your pawn shop, broken-heart man
