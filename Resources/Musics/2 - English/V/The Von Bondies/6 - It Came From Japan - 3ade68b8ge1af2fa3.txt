IT CAME FROM JAPAN

Put away your cigarettes
And your high class attitude
Turn emotion to devotion
Baby I can see it in you too
We all hail hail from rock and roll 
From behind a glass case

We all hail hail from rock and roll 
From behind a glass case

Put away your cigarettes
And your high class attitude
Turn emotion to devotion
Baby I can see it in you too
We all hail hail from rock and roll 
From behind a glass case

We all hail hail from rock and roll 
From behind a glass case

Put away your cigarettes
And your high class attitude
Turn emotion to devotion
Baby I can see it in you too
We all hail hail from rock and roll 
From behind a glass case

We all hail hail from rock and roll 
From behind a glass case

From behind a glass case
From behind a glass case
