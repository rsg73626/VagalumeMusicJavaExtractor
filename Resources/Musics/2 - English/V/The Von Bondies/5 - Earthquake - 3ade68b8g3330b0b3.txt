EARTHQUAKE

So glad to meet you, baby
Let's start things over
And then I reach out, honey
To say "move over"

This bad heart
This jealous love's turned madly
Better not fuck with us, who's sorry?
You're sorry
So sorry

This is no earthquake, honey
You just got sober
Why won't you wake up, baby?
We're taking over

(is thank you enough?)
(is thank you enough?)
(is thank you enough?)
(is thank you enough?)

We'll keep it arms length, baby
As we grow bolder
I'm so retired, honey
Thank god you're over

This bad heart
This tainted love, turn madly
Better not fuck with us, who's sorry?
You're sorry
So sorry

This is no earthquake, honey
You just got sober
Why won't you wake up, baby?
We're taking over

This isn't shame now
This is a bright light in your eyes
This is no earthquake, honey
You just get older
Older and older
Oh oh oh-oh

This is no earthquake, honey
You just got sober
I haven't seen you lately
Let's talk things over

This is a shakedown
This is a dawning of your life
This is a outbreak, honey
This is now our time (who's sorry now?)
This is a shakedown (who's sorry now?)
This is a bright light in your eyes
(who's sorry now?)
This isn't over (who's sorry now?)
This isn't over (who's sorry now?)
Over and over (who's sorry now?)
Oh oh, whoa (who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry now?)
(who's sorry?)
