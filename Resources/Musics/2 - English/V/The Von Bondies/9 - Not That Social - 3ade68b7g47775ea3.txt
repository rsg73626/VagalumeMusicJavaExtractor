NOT THAT SOCIAL

I'm the centre of whats getting you near*
but if you wanna, you better come quickly
you're not that social, just a good drinker

i know a way, to make things better
do i mean it, or am i just mean
you're not that social, just a good drinker

ahh ah ah ah ah ah
ahh ah ah ah ah ah

theres no limits to the problems you bring
you need help, and i need the chance and its on its way
you're not that social, just a good drinker

i've been hinting for a long long time
you'll never make it, this is the end
you're not that social, just a good drinker

ahh ah ah ah ah ah
ahh ah ah ah ah ah

breathe in, breathe out
i know you're tryin (x7)
breathe in, breathe out
you're not that social, you're just a good drinker

breathe in, breathe in
you're not that social, you're just a good drinker
breathe in, breathe in

breathe in, breathe out
i know you're tryin (x3)
breathe in, breathe in (x2)
