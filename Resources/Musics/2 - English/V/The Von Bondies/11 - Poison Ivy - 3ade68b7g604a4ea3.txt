POISON IVY

Nothing can compare
Two weeks I stared
Hands, hand tied

I got an itch
I call her poison ivy
It can kill
Hey hey, oh well

I've got an itch
I call her poison ivy
It can kill
Oh, well

Poison ivy
Poison ivy
Poison - hey hey hey hey

Took my youth
Everything that ever meant something
Nothing comes between me and you
Most of my friends
Most of my friends
Are dead because of you

Poison ivy
Poison ivy
Poison - hey hey hey hey

I had no choice
But to love you
Poison ivy
Poison ivy
Poison ivy
hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey

ooh ooh ooh ooh
(fade and repeat to end
