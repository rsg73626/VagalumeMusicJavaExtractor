BROKEN MAN

I'm a broken man
This here's my broken band
From a broken land
We take the good, the bad
yeah

I'm a broken man
From a broken land
This here's my broken band
From your hand
yeah

I'm a broken man
This here's my broken band
From a broken land
We call Detroit City
There's no blood on these hands
That's why we came to take a stand
We take the good, we take the bad
It's all we ever -
It's all we had
yeah

I'm a broken man (x6)
