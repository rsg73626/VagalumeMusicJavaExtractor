MAIREAD

Oh, Mairead
Your love is beyond compare
You have streaks of ivory hair
Two lips I wouldn't dare

Oh, Mairead, sweet sweet Mairead
Love of my life Mairead
Oh Mairead
Oh Mairead, Oh Mairead

It's your oasis, stroke of the pen
It's your hive of friends, baby
Tell me is this the end

Oh, Mairead, sweet sweet Mairead
Love of my life Mairead
Oh Mairead
Oh Mairead, Oh Mairead

You hide behind an icy stare
Do you even care whether I'm here?
Whether I'm there, oh Mairead
You sucked my dry, took all my will to live
Look at me, oh look at me Mairead

Sweet Mairead
Sweet sweet Mairead 
Sweet sweet Mairead 

Oh, Mairead, you've took every every ounce of my love
Left me for dead, I think I've had enough
Oh, Mairead, you said it was true love
You said it was everything you ever wanted
You said, you said lies, you said lies
Oh, Mairead, played me for a fool
Oh Mairead, oh Mairead you took everything and you left me
Left me for dead
