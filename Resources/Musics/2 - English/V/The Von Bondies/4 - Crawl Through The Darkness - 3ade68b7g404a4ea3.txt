CRAWL THROUGH THE DARKNESS

Crawl through the darkness 
Fear all that don't (x2)
Fate is a gift 

Can you see their eyes and the daggers that follow?
Anything and everything that stand in their way
Wait, please wait, said the boy to his father
Reachin' for his hand as his heart starts to sway
Reachin' for his hand as his heart starts to sway

Crawl through the darkness 
Fear all that don't (x4)
Fate is a gift 

Truth by truth you'll break men in time
What makes a man drink and another man cry
If not a gift, then a chance to lay blame
Through borrowed hours of our lonely lives
Through these borrowed hours of our lonely lives

Crawl through the darkness 
Fear all that don't (x4) 
Fate is a gift 

I need to be alone, I'm halfway to nowhere
No one to call on now that I'm alone
Wait, please, wait, said the boy to his father
Reachin' for a hand as my heart starts to sway
Reachin' for a hand as his heart starts to sway

Crawl through the darkness
Fear all that don't (x5)
Fate is a gift
