BUNKER (SOLID GROUND)

I'll stay with you 'cause I know how
To keep my feet on solid ground
My milk turned sour when left on the bunker for days

I know that you're about to hit the 22.
That's old enough to know who's coming on to you
You're complacent with strangers.
And everyone that falls by the way
I see your tangerines are fading into black
You'd rather lie out front with him and leave me in the back
But you're still Rosie from door 6
And tainted smiles they get me everytime

I'll stay with you 'cause I know how
To keep my feet on solid ground
My milk turned sour when left on the bunker for days

Not many days ago you learned to cut the rope
The rope that now is saving you from learning how to cope
So cut it in half and use each side
To lasso up the ones you love the most
Should I oil you up, or shake you down
Pick you up and squeeze you out
Of this little black hole
You fallen into time and time again.

I'll stay with you 'cause I know how
To keep my feet on solid ground
My milk turned sour when left on the bunker for days

Stop talking on the phone when the cables on my neck
Your logic's running out, on the movies that you've found
Get you heart above my strings, you silly little thing
Your tired mind is wasted on my time

I'll stay with you 'cause I know how
To keep my feet on solid ground
The milk turns sour when left on the bunker for days

I'll stay with you 'cause I know how
To keep my feet on solid ground
I'll stay with you 'cause I know how
To keep my feet on solid ground
You know I'm gonna keep my feet
You know the milk turned sour when left on the bunker for days
