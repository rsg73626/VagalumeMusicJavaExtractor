LEAN ON MY WORLD

I'm just a subject of the modern and hot
I'll leave my pepsi and my cola for starts
I've been meaning to tell you that
I think my favourite colour is blue
My infatuation with all the reds
And the pinks is for you

Don't lean on my world
Don't lean on my world

The lifes as so we started out in Boston is taunted to leave
The place was never liveable anyway caught into me
Shall we push a little further as petty all the parts give us
And can we push a little further as petty all the parts give us

Can we turn with the light
Or we'll be burn alone in the night
Don't lean on my world
Don't lean on my world
Oh no, skip away the love again

So shift along on your horoscope
And fill your lungs with little hope
Just like a red rag to a bull
Feeling you're not so invited too
Like a red rag to a bull
Feeling you're not so invited too

Can we turn up with the light
Or we'll be burn alone in the night
Don't lean on my world
Don't lean on my world
Don't lean on my world
Don't lean on my world
Don't lean on my world
