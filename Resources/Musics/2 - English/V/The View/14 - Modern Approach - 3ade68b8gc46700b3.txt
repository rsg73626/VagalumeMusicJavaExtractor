MODERN APPROACH

So let the bitch destroy the clouds
If you can find the one to suit you
And when your girl's inside your mind
So can you skin upon the wall

Eh-ye-Eh-ya-Eh-ya-Eh-ya
Eh-ye-Eh-ya-Eh-ya-Eh-ya

The legacies these times and those
Ones who are only blessed will turn
The clever kids won't hold me back
And I'll show 'em meaner for the tuck

Won't grow older just lie under
So take a modern approach
Don't alter all the words you feel
You're just a sinner stare above
But you can take the grass right here
Eh-ye-Eh-ya-Eh-ya-Eh-ya
Eh-ye-Eh-ya-Eh-ya-Eh-ya

The God sinner world
That you haven't heard

So take a modern approach
Don't alter all the words you feel
You're just a sinner stare above
But you can take the grass back here
