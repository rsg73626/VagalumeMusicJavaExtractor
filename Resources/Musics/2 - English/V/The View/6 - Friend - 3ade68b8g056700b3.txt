The girl that I've been speakin' to my whole life,

The girl that I've been speakin' to my whole life,
Has left me for my friend,
The girl that I've been speakin' to my whole life,
Has left me for my friend
And I can change,
But I can't change yesterday,
And I'd rather change,
But things wont be the same.

And I can change,
But I can't change yesterday,
You'll do the same,
But I can't change your way

And I can change,
But I can't change yesterday
Oh we can change,
But I can't
