BEAUTIFUL

Boy you've dug your head out of a thousand holes
You've gotta stand up, you gotta take the blows
Cos if you don't take the blows then the girl won't sing
And the grass won't grow

Sometimes I think that I think too much
And that it's all in my head, and I can't touch
Cos if you touch too much then the lights won't go
And the water won't flush

And I'm chasing all my cares away
Fighting for freedom for one day
I'm chasing all my cares away
So take me to that beautiful way

Nigel said my eyes look blank too much
And if I carry on my mind will turn to mush
And if it turns to mush then the strings won't rattle
And the paint won't brush

He said you're only happy when you're pissed
I said "No I'm not", he said "I insist"
How many times should you have blown a kiss
But instead you swung your fist

And I'm chasing all my cares away
Fighting for freedom for one day
I'm chasing all my cares away
So take me to that beautiful way
Take me to that beautiful way

What was that dripping away?
Oh was it water or time?
Was it a stunt or a crime?
You can only own your own life
So I own mine, I own mine

And I'm chasing all my cares away
Fighting for freedom for one day
I'm chasing all my cares away
So take me to that beautiful way
Take me to that beautiful way
