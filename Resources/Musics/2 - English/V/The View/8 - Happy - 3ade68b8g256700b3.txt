HAPPY

I wasn't born to make you happy
I wasn't born to make you sad

I never hear my sweetheart calling
I wonder if the truth stands tall
Cos I'm playing your game, fighting for your name
I'm sticking around cause I'm lonely

I wasn't born to make you happy
I wasn't born to make you sad

I know you see my sweet surrender
You're still the bitch that makes me mad

I never hear your young heart bleeding
My ear is never close to unwanted taps
But I won't let your drip run dry, I'll live with your lie
I'm sticking around cause I'm lonely

I wasn't born to make you happy
I wasn't born to make you sad

I know you see my sweet surrender
You're still the bitch that makes me mad

So when I come I hope you know
That you'll have no place left to go
And I won't find no room in here
For you to chuck me out on my ear

I wasn't born to make you happy
I wasn't born to make you sad

I know you see my sweet surrender
You're still the bitch that makes me mad

Without the L, Without the E
What is love to you and me

I wasn't born to make you happy
I wasn't born to make you sad
