GIRL

Lying in some euphoric vibe
Stories being told, of a girl you'd like to ride,
She seems nice, to the blind man with a drink
But oh man what a tea leaf, no second chance to think
She'll say she's changed, but I know her game,
She'll cane all of your baggies, and leave someone to blame
So I'm never gonna ask her

Don't let the girl come in, Don't let the girl come in,
She'll put you in a spin, take everythin'
Just dont let her in

I enter in, the middle of the night,
This house it seems so empty, I can feel her kickin about,
The door goes crash, and out goes my guitar
Musn't worry much, cos next doors never far,
So I chap the door, and out she comes,
Lookin rather smokin', as if nothin has occured
So I'm never gonna ask her

Don't let the girl come in, Don't let the girl come in,
She'll put you in a spin, take everythin'
Just dont let her in
Just dont let her in

Don't let the girl come in, cos you know,
You know she'll put you, put you in a spin
So stay away, don't answer open,
Answer nothing more,
Whats is goin' on in your house.
On in your house
On in your house
On in your house

Don't let the girl come in, Don't let the girl come in,
She'll put you in a spin, take everythin'
Just dont let her in

Don't let the girl come in,(dont let her in)
Don't let the girl come in, (dont let her in)
She'll put you in a spin, take everythin'
Just dont let her in
Just dont let her in
Just dont let her in
