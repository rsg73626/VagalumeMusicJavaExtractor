ANFIELD ROW

Right about time that he on the bedroom floor
That up with all his games and his narrow, narrow scores
Walking on my own on my broken front door alone
And every colour of a man walks by
And I've seen the girls I made them laugh and made them cry
They all crash here 'cause it's easy on the eye, you know

Because I love you but I have to leave
This whole town when it's off it gets mean
I'm an arrow, but there's no bow
Living without you on Anfield Row

(Verse)
Well I'll see you again time will always tell
But for now I'm afraid that is has to be farewell
You be walking into heaven and walking into hell I know
I have known

Because I love you but I have to leave
This whole town when it's off it gets mean
I'm an arrow, but there's no bow
Living without you on Anfield Row

My breathe so used to corner
I can't look at you no longer
I must get on with the show
And that's the only reason that I have to go

Because I love you but I have to leave
This whole town when it's off it gets mean
I'm an arrow, but there's no bow
Living without you on Anfield Row

Living without you on Anfield Row
