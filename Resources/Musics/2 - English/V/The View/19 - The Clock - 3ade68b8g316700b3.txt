THE CLOCK

The fire exit door has never agreed with me
I'm never sure whether to burst or burn
The fire exit door has never agreed with me
And leave me burning and I'm born the firm

And oh the clock, the clock has no sympathy
And oh the clock, the clock's had it's way with me

Sway away if you're fed up off me
I'll never give you the time of day
If you won't get me my way
I'll never say something that I don't mean
Unless I really mean it,
And I really mean it now

'Cause oh the clock, the clock has no sympathy
And oh the clock, the clock's had it's way with me
And oh the clock, the clock has no sympathy
And oh the clock, the clock's had it's way with me

There's no fighting and no hiding
Now my pains is gone

And oh the clock, the clock has no sympathy
And oh the clock, the clock's had it's way with me
And oh the clock, the clock has no sympathy
And oh the clock, the clock's had it's way with me
Seal me up

'Cause the clock has no sympathy
And the clock's had it's way with me
And the clock has no sympathy
And the clock's had it's way with me
