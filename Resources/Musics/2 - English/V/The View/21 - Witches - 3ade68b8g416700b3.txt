WITCHES

(Witches work only with magic)
And waiting on adulthoods tragic,
Pull the cover over one more time,
Stab us in the back your trademark crime,
It's never fine

Scratch your fingernails right down the blackboard
Abuse your manicure why don't you,
Whoah oh!
And paperclips can bend and shape my dear,
Cause they are cheaply manufactured
Just like you, whoah oh!
(A big bar of chocolate)

Witches work only with magic,
And waiting on adulthoods tragic,
You can turn me into stone
Cause a worthless snake sits in her throne,
All on her own

Witches work only with magic,
And waiting on adulthoods tragic,
Don't come down lookin' for me
Cause I'm 22, and on tv,
Oh can't you see
You won't get me

So don't you try to scare me so
With your purple eyes and square toes,
My mother warned me about you
You're not as bad as you look
And I found you in a book
(Snakes like little boys)

Witches work only with magic,
And waiting on adulthoods tragic,
Pull the cover over one more time,
Stab us in the back your trademark crime,
It's never fine

Witches work only with magic,
And being bold sometimes is tragic,
If you're livin' in witches lane
You only have your parents to blame
Stay away, stay away from me!"
