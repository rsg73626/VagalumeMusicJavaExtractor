WALLS

(There's cracks on these walls
Ten thousand feet tall
Don't know what to do with them all)
I'm gonna build a million metre ladder
And I'm gonna fix them all

Someones tried to get out
Someones tried to get in
You know it weighs a tonne
You know my ego wears a grin
Someones tried to get out
Someones tried to get in
You know it weights a tonne
You know my patience is wearing thin

I'm gonna find a hundred million people and I'll turn them into one...
Of these walls

She's a real life girl in this fucked up world
And I suggest you call her the one
Disposable world full of throwaway girls
And I think that our time's not done

(The roof is falling down
And the ceiling wears a frown
At the only house in town where the ceiling falls down)
So let's rip up every slate and slab and see what's going down
And these walls

She's a real life girl in this fucked up world
And I suggest you call her the one
Disposable world full of throwaway girls
And I think that the beat is done
She's a real life girl in this fucked up world
And I suggest you call her the one
Disposable world full of throwaway girls
And I think that our time's not done.
