AB (WE NEED TREATMENT)

You shouldn't be so
You shouldn't be so
You shouldn't be so
You shouldn't be so

Oh when I call you up, you shouldn't be afraid to say
You're not feeling up so hot on this rainy day
I know a circumstance would ever give you the chance
To break the obvious stacking in my hands
So don't sing to me

You shouldn't be so A
You shouldn't be so B
You shouldn't be so hey,what's wrong with me

And know that jenikai would love up with the birds to fly
If you may lie corrupt behind your lie
I told you once before
The life is for them shut behind the door
But you must see I talk with books and grab so much more
So don't sing it to me

You shouldn't be so A
You shouldn't be so B
You shouldn't be so hey,what's wrong with me

And if the time should come
For us to ever fall apart
I swear she lies and customize
An awesome some men be in half
I keep us together through wars and through weather
We're set on this team on a different embark it with me
To keep away our goal's landing
Don't you worry about
No don't you worry about my Ab poetry
Don't you worry
Now make me see

You shouldn't be so A
You shouldn't be so B
You shouldn't be so hey,what's wrong with me
