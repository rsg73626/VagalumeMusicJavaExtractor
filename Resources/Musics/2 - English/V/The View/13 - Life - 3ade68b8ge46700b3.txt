LIFE

I want you to know I had no place to go
Want you to see what you done to me
Because of him you've thrown me away
You could of gone with him and chose another day

Just because your gullible ranger
You've made me feel like I'm deranged
And that seems strange cause you gave me the life
That seems strange cause you gave me the life

I'm feeling almost dead you're messing up my head
I'm in the wrong direction still no support
Because of him you've thrown me away
You could of gone with him and chose another day
The road that you have taken now
Is all because of me somehow
And that seems strange cause you gave me the life
That seems strange cause you gave me the life

Just because your gullible range
You've made me feel like I'm deranged
And that seems strange cause you me the life

And I'll love my son, like you loved one
I will become another part of you
I'll carry the weight of you

So I'll love my son, like you loved one
It's now my turn to follow a better day
Think of a better way

I'll love my son, like you loved one
I will become another part of you
I'll carry the weight of you

I want you to know I have no place to go
Want you to see what you've done to me
