HOLE IN THE BED

I miss you like a hole in the bed
Unlike these pills you really cleared my head
You're the answer to my prayers
The only one that cares
That's all

I love you like, the night loves dove
You fill me back together when I've been torn apart
You're the answer to my prayers
You're the only one that cares
That's all

These dreams were made for me and you
I can't remember when it ever get so untrue
These dreams were made for me and you
I can't remember when the truth began so, so untrue

I miss you like a hole in the bed
Unlike these pills you really cleared my head
You're the answer to my prayers
The only one that cares,oh

I need you like love needs hate
I've been so alone but I don't want to wait
I have everything that I need
Why should I keep tempting fate, I don't

I miss you like a hole in the bed
Unlike these pills you really cleared my head
You're the answer to my prayers
The only one that cares
That's all

Na-na-na-na you fill me back together

These dreams were made for me and you
I can't remember when it ever get so untrue
These dreams were made for me and you
I can't remember when the truth began so,so,so untrue
