BULLET

I'm coming up for all the world to see
Comparisons from middle guys and lucifier and me
'Cause I've been waiting for you but you are nowhere
Nowhere to be seen

If I catch a fly without agility or eye
And it turned out to be *you
Would you retreat and start to cry?
The blame has came from another place
Don't run away 'cause the camera caught your face
I'll never leave my love alone
The clever kids can push me on the floor

See I live with bad things that I've done
'Cause I'm God's son
I'm just a bullet gone wrong

My specticals neither shaded or see through
But they'll never lean into my eyes
When I'm perched up next to you
No pleasant cell, deepest well
Could ever cut me out *of this pretty public zoo
'Cause when the final time comes to test this life
I might be cheeky for a reason, but I wont lie

You know I live with bad things that I've done
'Cause I'm God's son
I'm just a bullet gone wrong

Don't chase me away
And don't chase me away

I've seen the pigs you've lying in
All the skeletons youve been hiding
I've seen the ghost your denying
I'm not your sholder to cry on
