STANDING, WAITING ON MY OWN (LONG STAND)

You wake up at dawn and got out of bed
Said you never forget all these things that I said
And you're working,well I'm working on a plan
I'm thinking about what to do when you're gone
Trying to forget all the times I was wrong
I was working,was working on my plan

Now you know you waited too long
Now you know that yesterday's gone

You,you said you love me
Now I'm standing,waiting on my own
You,you said you love me
Now I'm standing,waiting on my own

The soften, the blow that keeps you so keen
You try to pretend that you know what I mean
You start saying that you get it
And make sure you pack the bad from the punish
And lean on my world if you're acking so much
'Cause it's easy,it's easier than you

Now you know you waited too long
Now you know that yesterday's gone

You,you said you love me
Now I'm standing,waiting on my own
You,you said you love me
Now I'm standing,waiting on my own

I'm taking care of you, you're never wanted for nothing,no
And I'm taking care of you, giving you all of my loving,oh

You,you said you love me
Now I'm standing,waiting on my own
You,you said you love me
Now I'm standing,waiting on my own
