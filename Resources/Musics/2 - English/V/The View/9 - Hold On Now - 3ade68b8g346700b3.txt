HOLD ON NOW

As simple as a feelin', the rumours you believe in,
I'm not a worn out sun
As humble as a title, the things that you rely on,
I'm not a clogged up gun!

The scream that you are viewing, has left yer brothers fumin'?
Yer mothers purse is cursed
And don't think, blank, your bodys a tank
But your were born to try!

Your circles square, yer life needs repair
You're holdin' on to childrens books
I wanna tell you...I love you alot
But for that I need a belly full of wine, wine, wine, wine...

Chorus
I will hold on now
(what you doin', yer just losin')
I will hold on now
(what you thinking, yer just sinkin')

The drinkin' and the stealin', can stop you from the dreamin'
Buy yer hole comes first
The life that you've been leading, it tends to stop me breathin'
My pacifiers burst!

The fear that you've bestown, turns me inside out is boring
Yer still my ladybird

Ain't no space, grace
Yer out of your face
And your were born to try

Your circles square, yer life needs repair
You're holdin' on to childrens books
I wanna tell you ...I love you alot
But for that I need a belly full of wine, wine, wine, wine...

I will hold on now
(what you doin', yer just losin')
I will hold on now
(what you thinking? yer just sinkin'!)
I will hold on now x2

The only thing you need is a little bit of speed,
And take a line of joke,
The only thing you need is a little bit of me,
Lets have a drink and a smoke

... and I will hold on now x2

I will hold on now
(what you doin', yer just losin')
I will hold on now
(what you thinking, yer just sinkin')
X2
