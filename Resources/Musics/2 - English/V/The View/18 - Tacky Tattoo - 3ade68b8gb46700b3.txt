TACKY TATTOO

Sometimes I wanna sell my soul to the devil
And sometimes I wanna put a face long gone
And sometimes I feel that I'm not so clever
That I don't even know the things that I've done wrong

'Cause the girl with the tacky tattoo is the one you shouldn't do
It only lead to trouble epic fails
Oh the girl with tacky tattoo the one that ruined me and you
The one I wish I never knew

And sometimes would you sell your soul to the devil
And do you ever wanna put a face long gone
And sometimes you feel you're not so clever
That you can't even find a melody for your song

Oh the girl with the tacky tattoo is the one that shouldn't do
It will only lead to trouble epic fails
Oh the girl with tacky tattoo the one that ruined me and you
The one I wish I never knew

I'm not waiting around for the lost or the found
To come back around
I'm not waiting around for the lost or the found
To come back around
I'm not waiting around for the lost or the found
To come back around

Cause the girl with the tacky tattoo is the one you shouldn't do
It will only lead to trouble epic fails
Oh the girl with tacky tattoo the one that ruined me and you
The one I wish I never knew
One I wish I never knew
Oh I wish I never knew
Oh I wish I never knew
