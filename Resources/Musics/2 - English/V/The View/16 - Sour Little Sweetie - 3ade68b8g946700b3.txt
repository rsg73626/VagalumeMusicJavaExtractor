SOUR LITTLE SWEETIE

Always in the bye beaks
It's not how it looks buns of bettle on
And I'm being nucks, been running giving me just to
Good people gone and now being crooks
And wo-hoo

I dance the heat off my block
With the fever of my heart
Let the devil in me
I should have no turning back no

I tought I told you I got fancies on my lock
I tought I told you I got fancies on my lock

I dance the heat off my block
With the fever of my heart
Let the devil in me
I should have no turning back no

Sour little sweetie, little sweetie nonetheless
Like my bottom piece on my hair, so when the men saw
Darling, sweetheart don't strees
My head your messing don't you know

And never into good looks
I know the mighty raven
To start in with the babylon
Brick is not my foot, the whole world shook
Firmly with the noise that this is not a flick
Oh no

I dance the heat off my block
With the fever of my heart
Let the devil in me
I should have no turning back no

Sour little sweetie,little sweetie nonetheless
Like my bottom piece on my hair, so when the men saw
Darling, sweetheart don't strees
My head your messing don't you know

And silver fork you have to go
Though you tell me I don't know
Oh where did all the love go
Where did all the love go
Where did all the love go
Where did all the love go
Where did all the love go
Did all the love go
Where did all the love go
And where did all the love go
Where did all the love go
Where did all the love go

Sour little sweetie,little sweetie nonetheless
Like my bottom piece on my hair, so when the men saw
Darling, sweetheart don't strees
My head your messing don't you know
