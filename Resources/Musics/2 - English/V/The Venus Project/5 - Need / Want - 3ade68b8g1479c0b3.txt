NEED / WANT

Oh, slowly back and forth
Oh, say it's not my fault
Can't forget you when you go
I can't help myself at all

Restless when you're close to me
Dream the sweetest fantasy
Don't forget me when you go
I don't know myself at all

What I need and what I want
Never feels the same
Like the feeling that I'm home
No one know's my name
Can I blend into the walls
Whenever I'm ashamed
What I need and what I want
Just somebody else to blame
