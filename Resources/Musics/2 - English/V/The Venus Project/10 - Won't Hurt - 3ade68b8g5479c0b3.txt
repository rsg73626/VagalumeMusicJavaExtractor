WON'T HURT

I could know where I am and I'd still be lost
I could be lonely when the party is mine to host
For all the places I've been
I've only been skin and bone
So I wrap myself in you and pray
That I'm not a ghost

I'm not a ghost

I could be screaming
And you wouldn't hear a word
For however heavy my heart is, my mind is worse
But all that you hear
Is confidence clear as day
So I wrap myself in you
And pray that it won't hurt

It won't hurt
