DAUGHTER OF THE KING

Daughter of the king
How she wants to sing
Stories gold and bright
Give your love to her
Don't get mad at her
She's a gentle girl

Venus first light of the night
Hold your children tight

Daughter of the king
Oh, the joy she brings
When you see her smile
Give your love to her
She'll give you the world
Worthy of the king

Venus first light of the night
Hold your children tight
Jesus first and last
Love her
