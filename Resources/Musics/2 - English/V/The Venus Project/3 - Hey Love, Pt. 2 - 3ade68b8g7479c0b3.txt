HEY LOVE, PT. 2

Hey love I know some days
Just feel like ridiculously hard compared
To others and it's really hard
When you don't how to pinpoint why
Or figure out how to fix it

I'm glad they're coming around though
That'll be good but you're a tough cookie
And you always see things with reason
Eventually anyway

You're gonna be okay I'll be back in two weeks
And I love you so much, I miss you already
