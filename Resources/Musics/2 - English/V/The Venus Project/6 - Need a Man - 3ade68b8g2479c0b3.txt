NEED A MAN

When I wake
Oh, you start to take
Oh, you're free
Take what you need

Don't explain
Why you play this game
Oh, you're free
Take what you need

But you say I need a man
To protect me from other men
Can't you see the irony?
When you say I need a man
To protect me from other men
I don't see how the problem is me

When I'm wrong
All the times I'm strong
Go away
'cause I'm only as good
As my weakest day
And the words I say
Are only as good
As the mouth they escape

But you say I need a man
To protect me from other men
Can't you see the irony?
When you say I need a man
To protect me from other men
I don't see how the problem is me

But you say I need a man
To protect me from other men
Can't you see the irony?
When you say I need a man
To protect me from other men
I don't see how the problem is me
