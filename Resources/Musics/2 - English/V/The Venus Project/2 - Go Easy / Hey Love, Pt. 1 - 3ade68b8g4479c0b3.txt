GO EASY / HEY LOVE, PT. 1

Oh my
Strangest feeling I had tonight
I looked into my own eyes
But I didn't recognise
So I
Plummet into space and forget
Everything I regret
Feel how I used to feel

On and on
On and on
Don't save me when I fall
Just go easy

So go easy on me
No I'm not what you need
But am I still what you want?

So go easy on me
Do you wanna be free?
Do you know what you want?

(my head's confused)
(my heart's abused)
(my head's confused)
(my heart, oh)

So go easy on me
No I'm not what you need
But am I still what you want?

So go easy on me
If you wanna be free
Let me know what you want

I love when I do one of these
You can listen to it whenever you want
So you don't wanna ruin your little trip

Man I actually feel like a lot better now
But sometime's life is just a bit hard you know
I don't know why I find it so hard sometimes
But when I do I just like can't shift
My thinking or be like it's all right
Or just another day
Or not every day will be like this

Feels like a little bit of a knock
And when I get a knock I feel it that well
It's hard and I'm wondering
What the reasoning for it, is for?

But I know that everything will work out
And I can only give myself so much
But where do I belong?

What do I do? I just feel like recently
I've had more like sad days than good days
And I'm like let's switch that around somehow
And get a smile back on my wee dial
I have so much to be thankful and happy for

So can't let this dumb stuff get to me
Don't feel like you need to reply right now
And just wanted to love ya
