NUMB

I don't wanna feel numb
Don't wanna bite my tongue
I don't wanna feel numb
Don't wanna bite my tongue

Cause if I'm the only one who can save my soul
But I don't know how
Then I must be the only thing out of me
By putting myself down
Cause if I'm the only one who can save my soul
But I don't know how
Then I must be the only thing out of me
By putting myself down

I don't wanna feel low
I don't wanna grow cold
I don't wanna feel low
I don't wanna grow cold

If I'm the only one who can save my soul
But I don't know how
Then I must be the only thing out of me
By putting myself down
If I'm the only one who can save my soul
But I don't know how
Then I must be the only thing out of me
By putting myself down

No, down
No, down
No, down

When I find what I'm missing I'll be whole
Every time I go missing from my home
When I find what I'm missing

When I find what I'm missing I'll be whole
Every time I go missing from my home
When I find what I'm missing
