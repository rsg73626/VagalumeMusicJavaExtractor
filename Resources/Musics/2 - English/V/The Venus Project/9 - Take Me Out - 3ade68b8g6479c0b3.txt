TAKE ME OUT

Oh, take me out tonight
Oh, take me out tonight
And I'll forget everything
I'll forget everything
And I'll be fine

Oh, fill me up with a rush
Oh, fill me up with a rush
And I'll forget everything
Yeah, I'll forget everything
I'll be fine

Wasn't legit
Take my wishes tonight
Smoke and mirrors
How is it not?
