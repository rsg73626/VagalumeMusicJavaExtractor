LOVE IS COLDER THAN DEATH

Rosie
Oh I know we're both being used
Don't make no sense
Just to carry on as we do

You know I'd love you if I knew you'd let me down (x2)
Oh we need to get away (yeah we want to get away)
But we'll never get away now

It's easy when it hurts so say goodbye
We'll fall in love again just give it time
It's easy when it hurts so say goodbye
We'll fall in love again just give it pain

Rosie
Oh I know we both feel confused
Don't make no sense
Just to carry on as we do

I know you'd love me if you knew I'd let you down (x2)
Oh we need to get away (yeah we want to get away)
But we'll never get away now

It's easy when it hurts so say goodbye
We'll fall in love again just give it time
It's easy when it hurts so say goodbye
We'll fall in love again just give it pain

Don't let your love be colder than death
Don't let no tear drops fall from your eyes
Don't let your love be colder than death
Don't let no tear drops fall from your eyes

It's easy when it hurts so say goodbye
We'll fall in love again just give it time
It's easy when it hurts so say goodbye
We'll fall in love again just give it pain

It's easy when it hurts...
