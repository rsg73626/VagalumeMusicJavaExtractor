ONE WEEK OF DANGER

We're best friends
We hold hands
We're in love 
You're my man
Darling no
That's not me
I'm a ghost 
In the sheets

Well is there something that you like about her
Yes
I like the way that her body bends in half
And is there something that you love about her
No
There ain't a woman in this world I won't let go

Come on baby
We get along 
Please don't you spoil it
Don't steer us wrong
Lets get together
And get it on
Lets get those clothes off
Before I'm gone
You talk about like you own me baby
That's not fair
I told you that I had somebody else
You did not care
And now you're talking on the phone
You're tellin' all of your friends
We love each other (x8)

Well is there something that you wanted from her
Yes
I want her legs, her body, and her cash
And is there something that you needed from her
No

And if she's playing hard to get
I'm out the door
Oh no baby
Don't say it's true
Please say you love me
Like I love you
Come on baby 
We get along
One week of danger
I's not very long
Lets get together
And get it on
Let's get those clothes off
Before I'm gone
You talk about like you own me baby
That's not fair
I told you that I had somebody else
You did not care

And now you want to make me out to be some kind of square
And now you're talking on the telephone
You're tellin' all of your friends
We love each other (x8)
We love each other (x9)
