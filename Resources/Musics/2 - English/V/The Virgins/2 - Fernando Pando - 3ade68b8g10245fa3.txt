FERNANDO PANDO

I was pushed and shoved down the street in a bus fume haze
Building for a new day
Will become of you and me
Our love

I want to shout from the roof and all these things they just don't do
Will they wait for me and you?
Or just leave us both behind?
I don't know

She said, "Man I don't want to play around with words,
I just want to lay with you.
I can't solve the problems in this world
It's breaking my brain in two."

Hey baby don't you know
Our dreams they are the same
I'm waiting on you
I don't want you for your time
They promised you a lie
I swear it isn't true

Lately I can tell that you're scared
We're growing up
Say, maybe if you changed your hair
You'd be good enough
Kids I used to know that died
Now they're not around
I wonder what they think of life
When they're looking down

Want to walk to your door
So I head from the store
And I ring on your bell
'Cause I see that you're home
And I wait for a while
And I look up to the sky
But nobody comes

Back on my feet
I went straight to the place
Where we were when you said
All the words that you meant
For me then
Do you still feel them now?
Well I can't see how you do
But I hope that it's so

She said, "Well I know you and I we're getting high,
But it don't have to be this way.
Baby I don't want to say goodbye,
But it's all that I have to say."

Hey baby don't you know
Our dreams they are the same
I'm waiting on you
I don't want you for your time
They promised you a lie
I swear it isn't true

Lately I can tell that you're scared
We're you're growing up
Say, maybe if you changed your hair
You'd be good enough
The kids I used to know they died
Now they're not around
I wonder what they think of life
When they're looking down

(?)
You wish you were someone else
(?)
The kids I used to know they died
Well they're not around
I wonder what they think of life
When they're looking down

Lately I can tell that you're scared Cause we're growing up
Maybe if you changed your hair
You'd be good enough
The kids I used to know they died
Well they're not around
I wonder what they think of life,
I wonder what they think of life, when they're lookign down.
