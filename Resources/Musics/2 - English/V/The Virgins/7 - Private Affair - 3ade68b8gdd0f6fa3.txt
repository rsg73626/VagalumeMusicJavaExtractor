PRIVATE AFFAIR

Keep me with boil 
in New York's jungle's lovers wanted
Hope that night companion as
I wipe the sweat from my face

In the summer time, I fear I'm gonna lose my mind
but she's always avoiding falling in love 
Yes it's due to her life of a private affair

Curtains clapped and thrown open window 
Eyes are watching
Neon lights that cracks on the pavement lure me away

In the summer time, I fear I'm gonna lose my mind
but she's always avoiding falling in love 
Yes it's due to her life of a private affair
She's always avoiding falling in love 
Yes it's due to her life of a private affair

I was a playboy from Dubai to Paris
She worn a necklace made of pharaohs bones
Made our aquaintance on a sheet less mattres
She pressed my lips, she said this won't last long

But she's always avoiding falling in love 
Yes it's due to her life of a private affair
She's always avoiding falling in love 
Yes it's due to her life of a private affair
