TEEN LOVERS

Remember walking on the first time 
A future, light in skin and bright brown eyes 
It was September, girl you're looking so fine 
Sex, pack, sleep fallin' she's my sign 

One, two, three, four 

Teen lovers, don't wait 
Vacation is over, don't wait 
Teen lovers, don't wait 
Vacation is over, don't wait 

Standin' on front street 
She's giving me the sign 
Incentive: wanna know your DTF 
Better look both ways before you cross that line 

Five, six, seven, eight 
Could you have made a move? 
No, it's too late 

Teen lovers, don't wait 
Vacation is over, don't wait 
Teen lovers, don't wait 
Vacation is over, don't wait
