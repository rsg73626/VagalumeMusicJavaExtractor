FAST TIMES

All we ever think about is sex 
Nothing really matters 'cause we're young 
Girl I want to party 'till we crash 
I ain't got no plans on growin' up 

They try to tell ya 
That you're no good 
Well don't you listen oh no 
They wish they could let you see 
It doesn't matter at all 
Not to Me - It doesn't matter at all 

It doesn't really matter at all 
How could it matter at all? 

The world is just a joke 
It's such a mess 
You know we got to take it while we're young 
Bottles I just want to hear them smash 
I ain't got no plans on growin' up 

They try to tell ya 
That you're no good 
Well don't you listen oh no 
They wish they could let you see 
It doesn't matter at all 
Not to Me - It doesn't matter at all 

It doesn't really matter at all 
How could it matter at all? 

Said I don't give a fuck what people say 
All they want to do is bring us down 
Magazines and TV make us crazed 
Open up your eyes and look around
