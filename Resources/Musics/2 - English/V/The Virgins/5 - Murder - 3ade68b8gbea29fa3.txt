MURDER

Shoot to kill 
Don’t injure me, no 
Stale sheet slips 
From her waist across her thighs 

She cast the die on your plans 
Chances on everything 
You take your life in your hands 

Wow murder the way she likes 
Murder feels like 
Murder the way she likes 
Murder feels like 

Lipstick smears 
In the ashtray, oh 
Could she 
Be who she says, don’t lie 

She cast the die on your plans 
Chances on everything 
You take your life in your hands 

Wow murder the way she likes 
Murder feels like 
Murder the way she likes 
Murder feels like 

I don’t care what she’s done, I love you, we gotta get you outta here! how do you know she’s not gonna do the same thing to you? 
Fuck it 

She cast the die on your plans 
Chances on everything 
You take your life in your hands 

Wow murder the way she likes 
Murder feels like 
Murder the way she likes 
Murder feels like 

Well somebody did you dirty 
Spilled your tears onto the street 
Well your heels already hurt 
As you disappear 
Tips are coming from a snitch 
Said he saw who did the deed 
And they’re turning up the heat 
Crime wave stretches the beat 
My shirt it clings to me because of you 
I loved you I love you 
Won’t let them put this shit on you 
Picked you right out of a lineup 
I got money we could get away from here 

Somebody did you dirty 
Maybe it was me 
Somebody did you dirty 
Maybe it was me 
Somebody did you dirty 
Maybe it was me 
Somebody did you dirty 
Maybe it was me 

She cuts the way she likes
