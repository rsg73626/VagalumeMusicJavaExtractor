RADIO CHRISTIANE

Now check it 

I'm feeling fine 
You're feeling the same 
You want it like that 
It was a romance 
It was a radio 
It was a radio 
It topped the radio, baby, baby, 
Baby, come on 

Damn it for understanding 
I'm always racing against my mind 
Take in consideration 
But it's so easy to say goodbye 

Oh Christiane 
You never been wrong 
And make that plan 
But have a little fun 

Oh Christiane 
You never been wrong 
And make that plan 
But have a little fun
