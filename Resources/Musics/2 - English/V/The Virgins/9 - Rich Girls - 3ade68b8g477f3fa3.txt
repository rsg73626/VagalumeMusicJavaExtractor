RICH GIRLS

We'll walk around 
Pretending we're all grown up 
Hey, rich girl! 
Well, can you tell me why 
You're so stuck up? 
When you act like you're so down 
Does paranoia come around 
And seize your mind now 
Roll your eyes! 
There's investigation to be done 
Like who's been wearing what with who 
So what's been going on? 
You got to know! 
You got to know! 

I'll tell you everything I know, 
Any little thing I know. (x2) 

You've got a lovely way with words, 
Must be the way you see the world, 
It's just the way you see the world 

We'll walk around 
Prentending we're all grown up 
Hey, rich girl! 
Well can you tell me why 
You're so stuck up? 
When you act like you're so down 
Does paranoia come around? 
Now read your mind 
And take your eyes 
Investigation to be done 
Like who's been wearing what with who 
Hey, what's been going on around here, 
Gotta tell me 
You got to know! 
I'd like to know! 

I'll tell you everything I know, 
Any little thing I know. (x2) 

You've got a lovely way with words 
Must be the way you see the world 
It's just the way you see the world 
Oh what a lovely way with words 
Is that the way you see the world? 
It's just the way you see the world 

I went down to your house last weekend 
You said, "Come on man, 
You don't have to point out everything that's bad. 
So there's a broken mirror on my bed, 
I'll clean it up, so what? 
You don't have to be such an asshole all the time." 
Oh, don't be like that
