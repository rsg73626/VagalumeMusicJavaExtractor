HEY HEY GIRL

Living on a farm road 
Takin' all your time slow 
Cheerin' from the bleachers 
Don't you wish your life was gold? 
I bet you do 

Passing out your lighter 
Sneakin' through the doorway 
Fakin' like you just stayed home 
That's how it really goes 
You know it does 

I don't think that we're bad 
I don't think we're bad at all 
It just takes some time alone 

Hey Hey Girl 
We're the wild type 
But we've been around the block one too many times tonight 

Fucked up at the disco 
Slipping in the K-Hole 
Sleeping in the parks, no fun 

They we need an education, lack imagination 
Holding out for something dumb 

Kickin' for the third time 
And now we're done 

Bread and butter 
Cryin' on the subway 
Waitin' on a cold day 
Don't react, here he comes 

I don't think we're bad 
I don't think we're bad at all 
It just takes some time alone 

Hey Hey girl, we're the wild type 
But we've been around the block once too many times tonight 
(x2) 

I know that it's easy 
That it's easier said than done 
I know that It's easy 
That it's easier said than done 

Hey hey girl, we're the wild type...(x2)
