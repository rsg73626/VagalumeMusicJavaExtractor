DISTANCE

How long 'till you let me take you higher?
Are we ever gonna finish?
Please, don't you? Please make up your mind!
'Cause the earth keep turnin'
and my head keeps spinnin'
Could this be the bottom for my soul? Oh oh

Could this be the vision, yeah
Really, something's wrong and you should know
But you know
It must've been the distance
It must've been the distance

How long 'till you let me get inside your home?
Am I ever gonna fin it, yeah?
Please, don't you? Please stay by my side
'Cause I've been so numb
and I'm tryina fight the feeling yeah
If you will not stand then let me know, oh oh
I need a little healing, yeah
Clearly I was wrong to let you go
But you know
It must've been the distance
It must've been the distance

The reason I can't see your smile, baby
The distance on your mind, baby
The reason I've been feeling blind lately
You know!
It must've been the distance
It must've been the distance
