GRAVITY

No fun in hanging aroud here all day, Seems like I'm pissing all over my leg, Walkin the plank, Watching the sharks as they swim waiting for dinner, Your gravity's defeating me, Sadness and beauty are one in the same, Now I'm drawing the line in the sand, over and over. Don't you feel the same way, I need to reciprocate, All those things that I have learned, have learned Storms in my head, they are brewing today, Too much resistance will soon break the gauge, Suck into space, notice the lack O2, Something's not right here, Your gravity's Your gravity's defeating me, Sadness and beauty are one in the same, Now I'm chasing salvation over and over again. Don't you feel the same way, I need to reciprocate, All those things that I have learned, have learned, Don't you feel the same way, I need to regurgitate, All those things that I have learned, have learned
