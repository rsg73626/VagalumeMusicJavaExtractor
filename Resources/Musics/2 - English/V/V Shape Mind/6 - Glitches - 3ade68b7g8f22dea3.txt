GLITCHES

Truth is taking over, Wrapped up in a suit of armor, Cannot penetratethis metal, Don't it make feel insecure, Seasons they are changing, Lit up like a christmas tree, Giving all the things desired, Too bad all the gifts are thge defective. Glitch in the system is pulling down, All these dirty bricks, they wigh a ton, The pressure's mounting and I don't mind, Waiting for these strings to come undone, The water's raising and I don't mind, Running for the shelter, The cul-de-sac is never ending, Cracks along the shell they surface, Pointing out the lines of distatse, Visualize escaping, Suck in by the tractor beam, Karmic retribution waiting, Eager to spread its seedless. Glitch in the system is pulling down, All these dirty bricks, they wiegh a ton, The pressure's mounting and I don't mind, Waiting for these strings to come undone, The water's raising and I don't mind, Glitch in the system is pulling down, Lie in the fetal positon now,All these d irty bricks, they wiegh a ton, The pressure's mounting and I don't mind, Waiting for these strings to come undone, The water's raising and I don't mind
