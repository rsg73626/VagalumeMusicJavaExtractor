THAT COOL REFRESHING DRINK

All the lemonade I've made, Filling oceans, making waves, Don't really seen that strange, All the scenery has changed, Those precious little things, Disappearing day by day. So how's it going, And are you feeling well, The Karma's coming, It's catching up with you. So now, have you redeemed yourself, The faster the empty feelings go away,So now, did you redeem yourself, The quicker the empty feeling goes. Sailing on the seas of rage, Still dizzy from the haze, Denial shows its face, Darkness always permeates, I'm cleaning up the stains, A sin-o-matic maze, So how's it going, And are you feeling well, The Karma's coming, It's catching up with you. So now, have you redeemed yourself, The faster the empty feelings go away, So now, have you redeemed yourself,The faster the empty feelings go away, The cup is overflowing, And the yallow is not quite mellow, So now, have you redeemed yourself, The faster the empty feelings g o away,So now, did you redeem yourself, The quicker the empty feeling goes.
