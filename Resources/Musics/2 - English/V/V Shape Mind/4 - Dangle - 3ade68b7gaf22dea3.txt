DANGLE

Snapshot the big to comin' your way, Footsteps they're heavy deafeining me, Woodenkeeps me company, second string put me in, Insert the ink pen, juguler vein, Break out the lunch box calling your name. Taking my hand and we'll walk throught the oblivian, kiss the gun. [Chorus] When it all starts to fade away, In the meantime, Just dangle in fom me strange dichotomy, And tomorrow, I'll waste away, In the meantime, Just dangle in fom me strange dichotomy. Suck out the life force, leave a little pease, Meat in the teeth, such a delicy, Just keep feeding the prostetic energy, see what it brings. Synthetic delusions interfering. Angelic voices reasuring me, In the distance pendulum swinging free, beautifully. When it all starts to fade away, In the meantime, Just dangle in fom me strange dichotomy, And tomorrow, I'll waste away, In the meantime, Just dangle in fom me strange dichotomy. Dangle in front, D angle in front, Little bits of insecurity Let it bleed, insanity.
