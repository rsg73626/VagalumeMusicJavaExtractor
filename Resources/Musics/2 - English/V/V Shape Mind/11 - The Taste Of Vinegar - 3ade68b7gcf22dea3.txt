THE TASTE OF VINEGAR

Soak it up like the sponge I am, Wring it over my face and hands, all over, Consume me in my shackled state, devastate, recreate, Those those things you'll never be. [Chorus] Taste of vinegar, Taste of vinegar, Taste of vinegar. Take my scars make me pretty on the outside, Make me oretty on the outside. Cause you kill my inspiration, Just like Mark David Chapman, Sometimes I balance on the brink, Think about how many times it takes to tumble over, Consume me in my shackled state, devastate, recreate, Those those things you'll never be. Taste of vinegar, Taste of vinegar, Taste of vinegar. my scars make me pretty on the outside, Make me oretty on the outside. Cause you kill my inspiration,With no intigation, You kill my inspiration, Just like Mark David Chapman.
