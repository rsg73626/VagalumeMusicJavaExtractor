MONSTERS

Is nothing sacred in those parasitic ways, Perhaps its just another to make you feel like you belong, I satnd accused of all your insecurities, Somehow your smoke and mirros cannot hidehide the envy. [Chorus] Monsters under the bed, under the bed, Bashing in your head, Somebody tell me, please tell me, who's got my back, YOU!!, Harsh untruths and those pathetic digs, I slit the throats of those FUCKIN pathetic little PIGS, On my beach I kick the metaphoric sand, flush the toilets of weakness with mushroom clouds in hand. [Chorus] Monsters under the bed, under the bed, Bashing in your head, Somebody tell me, please tell me, who's got my back, Monsters under the bed, under the bed, Bashing in your head, Somebody tell me, please tell me, who's got my back, YOU!! [Chad Gray (MuDvAyNe):] Stictch my throat closed, Cut my smile away, Sew my eyes, Blind, I can still see through you (i can still see through you) I can see right through you, I can still see through you (i can still see through you) I can see right through you. [Chorus] Monsters under the bed, under the bed, Bashing in your head, Somebody tell me, please tell me, who's got my back, Monsters under the bed, under the bed, Bashing in your head, Somebody tell me, please tell me, who's got my back.
