BRAKECHECK

What about all the things that's come over me, Thinking 'bout some atrocities, What about all that blatant stupidity flowing over, Sickness mauling, the leaves falling, the leeches are crawling on me, What about, waht about all those things. Triple dog dare you to fall asleep, i dare you, Oh Brakecheck what about about the pursuit of validity, Hope to test elasticity, What about all the brazen metricity flowing through me, Pocketful of molotov, I'm dreaming of infinty, What about, What about all those things, Triple dog dare you to fall asleep, i dare you, Oh Brakecheck
