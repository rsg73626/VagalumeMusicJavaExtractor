ANTITHESIS OF ORIGAMI

Waiting for a sign to say its OK, Faking all the smiles wrapped around my face, Focus on the pain and exfoliate, Focus on the pain, Antithesis. Carving notches in the past of no regret, Basking in the glow waving checkered flags, FUCK you and your game, I exfoliate, FUCK you and your game, Anithesis. And i feel indigo. I'm anotinted to be disappointed, Annoyed just to be, I'm anotinted to be disappointed, Oragami.
