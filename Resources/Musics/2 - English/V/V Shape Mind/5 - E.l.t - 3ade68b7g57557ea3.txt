E.L.T

Although it seems OK
It never really goes away
The damage is done
Always turns the color grey

No closures here
Floating in the air
No answers there,
It all just dissapeared...

And I wanted to... needed to be...
Every little thing you never were
As the ground breaks, and still sounds of disbelief
And the sound it makes, is just short of deafening

Let it go... (x2)

The master plan of shame
Cannot change the things to come
The fingers of blame
Break them all off one by one

An empty shell, searching for a soul
The cameras stare, emotion overload

And I wanted to... needed to be...
Every little thing you never were
Every little thing you never were

As the ground breaks
Still signs of disbelief
And the sound it makes, is just short of deafening

Let it go... (x4)
