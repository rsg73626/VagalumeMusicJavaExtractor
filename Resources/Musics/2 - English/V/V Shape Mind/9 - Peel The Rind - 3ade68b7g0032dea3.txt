PEEL THE RIND

Build it up to just break it all down and see what's left, Swinging at the fence, wonder which sand it will land on. Scratching the surface below, peel the rind peel the rind, There's plenty of to go, peel the rind peel the rind, Thick skin keeps me living, Struggle alive and well, Pleanty of layers to go. Time is standing still, yet the years have all passed me by, Looking for the ending, even though it just leaves me hanging. Scratching the surface below, peel the rind peel the rind, There's plenty of to go, peel the rind peel the rind, Thick skin keeps me living, Struggle alive and well, Pleanty of layers to go. Don't look at me they're re'building machinery to eat their young, Scratching the surface below, peel the rind peel the rind, There's pleanty of layers to go, Struggles alive and well, There's plenty of layers to go.
