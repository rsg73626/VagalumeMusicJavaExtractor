CARNIVAL

Melting at the seams 
when they were putting om their costumes 
delusions of grandeur 
impacting overrides your harnessed 
opening scene 

She fills her soul 
with pieces of fragile 
tasting far beyond 
your habitual 

Desperately you're trying hard 
but your face has fallen 
culminating in the yard 
you're balancing on the back wall
