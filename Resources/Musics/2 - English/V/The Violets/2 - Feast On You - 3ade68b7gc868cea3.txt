FEAST ON YOU

Symptomatic operation
How nice to be around
And i know
It's hard to open through

Ply the way with fascination
Unscrew the dirt with sound
And i know
The egg is often blue

Dismantled, where is compensation?
Underneath the ground
And i know
The way to open you

Fine lines dividing deprivation
Gold plate within a mound
And i know
I'd lie
To eat with you
