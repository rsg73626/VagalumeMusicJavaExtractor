MIRROR MIRROR

One look's telling the morning's dry 
communal yelling 
calypso coming 
brave face slants to the side and back 
has your hair slipped over 
your heart pierced black? 

Shattered all of the people have shining faces 
peering through at you 
shattered 
round and round 
there's no escaping what you see 

Half your body is talking true 
Split eye vision 
conducting you 
spike spike mirror mirror 
re invents 
the scarlet in you 
the surge they quench 

Witnessed love affairs 
a counter act 
those no go stairs 
a lost direction 
scattering like birds 
Has it come? 
Is it hear? 
Is it near? 
Disappeard? 

Mirrored an acclaimed reaction 
to a lover's ghost 
unsettled till the recognition 
of your lover's host 
Rorrim in Mirrordy 
you're mirrored like circuitry 
can't stop the day exhausting 
the things you see 

Scattering mirrors all over the floor 
piercing incisions 
echoing for more 
anything you can see 
I can see better 
have a pin above your eyes 
for what you haven't seen before 

Shattered...
