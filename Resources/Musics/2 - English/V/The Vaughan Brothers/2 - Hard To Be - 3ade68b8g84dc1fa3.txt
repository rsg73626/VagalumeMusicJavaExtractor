HARD TO BE

It's hard to be
It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

Can't you see
When I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me crazy

Something inside of me....When she's gone I miss her so
I wanna tell her how I feel....Just gotta let her know

When I'm alone with her
And she's in my arms I'm in heaven

It's all I see
In my dreams, we'll be happy together

Side by side
I hope that our love will stay this way forever

Something inside of me....Got a feelin' that won't let go
I wanna tell her how I feel....I just gotta let her know

Lookin' through her eyes
I see a paradise, no mistake she's full of fire

Like a real live wire....A house on fire
She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

Well it's hard to be
It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

Oh can't you see
When I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me crazy

Something inside of me....When she's gone I miss her so
I wanna tell her how I feel....I just gotta let her know

When I'm alone with her
And she's in my arms I'm in heaven

Like a real live wire....A house on fire
She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

Hard to be....It's hard for me
It's hard to keep, keep me from my baby
