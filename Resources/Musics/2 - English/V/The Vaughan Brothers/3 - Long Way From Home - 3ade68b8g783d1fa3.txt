LONG WAY FROM HOME

Look over here....Look over there
Look all around me everywhere
Well it doesn't really matter
Which way I wanna go
'Cause the night is a fallin'
And I'm a long long way from home
I am a long long way from home, yes I am

Listen to this....Listen to that
People tryin' to tell me
Where it's at
But it really doesn't matter
I hear it all the time
And I'm standing at the crossroads
'Bout to move on down the line
About to move on down the line

Well I've been over here....Been over there
Friends all around me everywhere
But it really doesn't matter
Which way I wanna go
I'm a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from home

Yeah a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from home
