WHITE BOOTS

That's my baby in the white boots....That's my baby on the floor
That's my baby havin' some fun....And yellin' more, more, more

That's my baby in the short skirt....Woo, out of control
Ah she becomes another woman....When she rocks and rolls

She's having a good time....Goin' round and round
She's really rippin' it up....You know she can't sit down, oh no

That's my baby lookin' so good....You know I can't explain
How when she's dancing in the white boots....It makes her go insane

She's having a good time....Goin' round and round
She's really rippin' it up....You know she can't sit down, oh no

That's my baby in the short skirt
With the white boots on

That's my baby in the white boots....That's my baby on the floor
That's my baby havin' some fun....And yellin' more, more, more

She's having a good time....Goin' round and round
She's really rippin' it up....You know she can't sit down, oh no

That's my baby in the short skirt
With the white boots on

With the white boots on
In the short skirt
With the white boots on

Can't explain....You know I can't explain
How when she's dancing in the white boots....It makes me go insane

White boots, white boots
White boots, white boots
