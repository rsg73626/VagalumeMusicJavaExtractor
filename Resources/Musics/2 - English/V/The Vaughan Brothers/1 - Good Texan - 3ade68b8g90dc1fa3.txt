GOOD TEXAN

Say things to me like a cowgirl would
I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should
You look romantic layin' in the hay
I need you tonight in a new kinda way
When you look at me with those eyes
It makes me start to fantasize

Do it to me like I know you could
So I can do it to you baby like a Texan should

Ridin' the range I think of you
I dig your chili you know it's true
Make big money put it in the bank
That longhorn Caddy got a great big tank

Do it to me like I know you could
So I can do it to you baby like a Texan should

Well you're the kinda woman who's above the rest
Well nothing for me but the best
You say you need a fella who really can
Do it to you good like a Texan man

Massive wardrobe of cowboy clothes
Top of my head to the tip of my toes
Ah you look so good in my hat with fringe on it
So put on my boots mmm doggone it

Do it to me like I know you could
I do it to you like a Texan should
Do it to me baby like I know you could
So I can do it to you baby like a good Texan should
