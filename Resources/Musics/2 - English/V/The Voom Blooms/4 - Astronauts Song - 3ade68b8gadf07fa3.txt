ASTRONAUTS SONG

i love you darlin, 
with all of my heart,
and we were so happy poor
like astronauts in the dark

but no no this isn't love,
the way it's supposed to be..
no no, this isn't love,
between that girl and me
(so we sang like that)

and we sang in gospels,
to hear our voices raise.
oh lord, can you hear us?
send us some better days

but no no this isn't love,
the way it's supposed to be..
no it'll take more than love
to save a boy like me

now the autumn leaves fall
like shooting sparks
and if we get to heaven 
could we go back to the start?

no no, this isn't love
the way it's supposed to be..
no it's much more than love
between that girl and me 

(then they all went up)

but i don't want you garden
i don't want your open doors
i don't want your sister
i don't want to be adored

i wanna live forever
in a castle that we grow
don't wanna keep marching on
around some friends 
that i barely know
