MOVING TO NEW YORK

i don't really want to go just yet,
there's no much i'd love to say to you all
hope that there is heaven up above
wish the world would all just fall in love 
they miss you so much now you're not around 
but hope that it is happiness you've found
i don't really want to go right now
there's so much i'd love to say to you all..
