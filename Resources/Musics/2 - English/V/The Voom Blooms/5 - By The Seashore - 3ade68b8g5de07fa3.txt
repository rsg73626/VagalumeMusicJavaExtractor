BY THE SEASHORE

well don't fell lonely
you're not the only girl
left dancin' on your own

are they in love?
well i think so..
with all the lights on,
don't want to bother you

well i know she lives by the seashore
well hey-ho, i know, let's go along

well don't fell lonely
you're not the only one
left thinking on your own

if he throws stones at those windows
they'll put the light on,
they're gonna bother you

well i know she lives by the seashore
well hey-ho, i know, let's go along

well don't feel lonely
you're not the only girl
left dancin' on your own

she sings old songs
till he returns with all the lights on
don't want to bother you

well i don't want the sun to go so low..
but don't fell lonely
we're not the only ones left sailing on our own

could we meet here by this old pier 
with all the lights on?
don't want to bother you..

well i know she lives by the seashore
well hey-ho, i know, let's go along

don't fell lonely
you're not the only girl
left dancin' in the sky
