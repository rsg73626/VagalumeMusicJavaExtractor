POLITICS & CIGARETTES

you can keep all your culture
cause we have got all our culture
and you can keep your politics
let someone else get your kicks for you

without us
without her
without

its awfully nice, that you've stayed
its awfully nice, what you've said for us
cause we all had such beautiful start
cause we have got such simple hearts
if you just hold on
to politics & cigarettes

you'll find...
that you and i, we're coming home
and you and i, we're on our own
you and i, we're coming home
and you and i, we're on our own

if you just hold on
to politics & cigarettes
why dont you hold on
we're on our own

just you and i, we're coming home
and you and i, we're on our own
we're on our own
if you just hold on
