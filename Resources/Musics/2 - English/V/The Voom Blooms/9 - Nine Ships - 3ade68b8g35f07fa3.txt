NINE SHIPS

the day we met i think 
you let me light your cigarette 
(do you remember how the snow fell?)
we watched all of the couples rowing boats 
they'd hired in hyde park 
(the old song just say it so well)
we drew a map out on his hands 
and then we bid our friends farewell 
(do you remember what they told me?)

"leave her Ronnie, you should leave,
leave her Ronnie
you should give her back to Jonny
while you go out to sea"

..to sing old songs on my way
sing old songs 
on my way back home tonight
oh my way i song old songs, on my way

oh, how your eyes they said it all
on this old ship i spend my days now 
(i dont know why, its called "The Albert")
i used to send you letters
you said you loved the way the words looked 
(do you remember that old fruit tree)
(where) we used to watch the couples 
rowing boats around the hyde park 
(do you remember what they told me?)

"leave her Ronnie, you should leave,
leave her Ronnie
you should give her back to Jonny
while you go out to sea"

..to sing old songs on my way
sing old songs 
on my way back home tonight
oh my way i song old songs, on my way

the day we met i think 
you let me light your cigarette 
(do you remember what they told me?)

when nine ships come home
then i'll be with you
their love is all you need
to get you through

old songs on my way
i sing old songs on my way back home tonight
on my way, those old songs, on my way
