ANNA

oh when she said hello
and things just fell apart my girl
now i guess we'll never know

oh darlin no,
it breaks my heart 
to watch you 
goo ff with someone new

cause you know that it 
just should be me and you
i never thought 
it'd make me fell so blue

oh darlin am i supposed to do
oh darlin you, 
it brakes my heart 
but you dont mind

but now that anna's my darlin 
we just dance all night 
now that anna's my darlin..

but we had to say goodbye,
and i just had to sit and cry my girl
and try and look for reasons why

but darlin you,
you borke my heart
when i watched you run off 
with someone new
cause all the boys say that
they saw that lad with you
i call your phone cause 
i just dont know what to do
i never thought this girl would 
make me fell so blue
but i suppose, 
its all alright if no one knows

that now that anna's my darlin 
we just dance all night
now that anna's my darlin.. 

but i still cant tel, yeah you know.. (that's all)
