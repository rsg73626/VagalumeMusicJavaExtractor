THOUGHTS OF RENA

i thought of rena yesterday,
i don't know what to say, she got me, oh oh
and i thought of rena just a moment ago,
she's from a right small town,
where things are so-so.
i thought of rena,
she's out with John, where'd all these townies come from?
look at em', oh oh.
as i talk to rena, they've had enough.

now there's a riot sound,
left, left, right, right, right, left, left.
left, left, right, right, right, left, left.
now there's a riot sound,
think that i should walk home, yet again.

(stare all you like mate, stare all you like)

could we dance dance dance till 2am maybe
she said i dont think so i dont think they'll like that. (x4)
