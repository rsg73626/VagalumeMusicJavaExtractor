ALL ABOARD THE ALBERT

well all aboard who come along
she said she liked my little songs
all the stories i would tell
and how she knew them very well
but now its time for us to all set sail

our houses lined up in a row
two up two down that's how they'd go
where she is i'll never know
we used to walk home in the snow
waving to the people that we know

well we were younger climbing trees
across the harbour to the sea
what a life there it would be
leave this town, just you and me
the summer came,
the birds sang with the leaves

so on nine ships we went along 
and kept in mind those little songs
promised her i would return
with maps and treasures in return
for all those stories that we heard long ago
for all those stories that we heard long ago

well we bid farewell on our way
and i hope i see that girl again someday
