LOVERS

she's asking me how could this happen
she's asking me how could this be
(i dont know, i just dont know, maybe...)
cause we are all such fragile things, my love
cause we are all such fragile things, but but but but but...

now she's asking me will this ever happen
she's asking me will this ever be
(i dont know, i just dont know, maybe...)
if we are all such hopeful things, my love
if we are such wonderful things, but but but but but...

have you seen her, its no secret Nicola
where do all the Lovers go?
where did all the Lovers go? (x2)

why do you feel so low? (x3)
why do you feel the way you do
...the way you do (x3)
