DAYDREAMS

Back and forth, it's wearin' me out thin
Sleepy morning, fall under my skin
Life in a China mall, paradise

In the hand of the [?]
Characters, they wander 'round the halls
I'm back and forth, know we got them all
Drinkin' out, sleepin' in, is all they do
Dreamin' away the sunshine

Wanna take me there
Even on adventuring
I'll just hang around
All [?] on these daydreams

Makin' sure I stay inside this place
Weather's worn, faces they look gray
Well I know I can't stay for much more time
I'm dreamin away the sunshine

Wanna take me there
Even on adventuring
I'll just hang around
All [?] on these daydreams, daydreams
