BITTER END

My mind is clear.
I have no fear.
Cuz now I know the other side of me
I'm letting go
Of who I used to be
Now I'm alive, feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end.

It took a thousand scars to find me
Every one of them reminds me.

I won't ever surrender like that
I know better, to ever fall back
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out
And left it there for dead.
Now I'm alive,
I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end.

I found my way
Through jaded days.
Cuz now I know the other side of me
I'm letting go of who I used to be
Now I'm alive, feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end.

It took a thousand scars to find me
Every one of them reminds me.

I won't ever surrender like that
I know better, to ever fall back.
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out and left it there for dead
Now I'm alive,
I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end
Bitter end.

My mind is clear.
I have no fear.

It took a thousand scars to find me
Memories remain.

I won't ever surrender like that
I know better, to ever fall back
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out and left it there for dead
Now I'm alive,
I'm feeling born again
And I will fight
Until the bitter end (2x)
