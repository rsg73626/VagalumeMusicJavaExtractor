WHERE I WANT TO BE

This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)

You tried to take my everything
Now look at who is laughing
This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)

Here's where you end
(Here's where you end)
Where I begin
(Here's where you end)
Silenced the lies that you said
Truth will always win, will win

This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)
It's taking every ounce of me
(It's taking every ounce of me)

You tried to take my everything
Now look at who is laughing
This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)

Who let you in?
(Who let you in?)
Under my skin
(Under my skin)
Silenced the lies that you said
Truth will always win, will win

This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)
It's taking every ounce of me
(It's taking every ounce of me)

You tried to take my everything
Now look at who is laughing
This is where I want to be
(This is where I want)

I won't back down
I'll stand my ground
I won't back down anymore (more)

This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)

You tried to take my everything
Now look at who is laughing
This is where I want to be
(This is where I want to be)

This is where I want to be
This is where I want
