HIDE THE TRUTH

I feel, feel...feel the world has reached an ending,
So here,here....heres the words I'm sending
Excuses are making and I'm not taking. . .

Still you try, to hide the truth from me
(but it will)
But it will be found. . .
It always shows it face
(when you turn)
When you turn around. . .
Around...

Your near, near...the moment of the all awakening
So here,here....heres the words that I am sending
Excuses are making and im not taking. . .

Still you try, to hide the truth from me
(but it will)
But it will be found. . .
It always shows it face
(when you turn)
When you turn around. . .
Around...

Are you happy now?
With your empty soul
Can you see that now?
That you've lost it all

Still you try, hide the truth from me
(but it will)
But it will be found. . .
It always shows it face
(when you turn)
When you turn around. . .
When you turn around...when you turn around
When you turn around
When you turn around
