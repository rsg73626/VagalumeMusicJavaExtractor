OVER ME

I wish I never left you behind, if only I could just push rewind.
Now that you're over me, now that you're over me yeah.
Why was I blind to see, The memories of us won't pass.
I try to let them go, Was our love to good to last? Will we ever know?

I can see, Now your gone, I can't seem to move on.
I know why, You're the one, 'Cause you're my oxygen.

I wish I never left you behind, If only I could just push rewind.

Now that your over me, Now that your over me yeah.
You are not my want your my need, You are all the reasons I breathe.
Now that your over me, Now that your over me yeah.
Why was I blind to see?

When you fell over the edge, I should have broke your fall.
Have you heard a word I said?
Are you listening at all?

I can see, Now your gone, I can't seem to move on.
I know why, You're the one, 'Cause you're my oxygen.

I wish I never left you behind, If only I could just push rewind.

Now that you're over me, Now that you're over me yeah.
You are not my want you're my need, You are all the reasons I breathe.
Now that your over me, Now that your over me.

I won't feel the same, I'm stuck inside the shame, And I know I'm to blame, That you don't feel the same, I won't feel again.

I wish I never left you behind, If only I could just push rewind.
Now that your over me, Now that your over me yeah.
You are not my want your my need, You are all the reasons I breathe.
Now that your over me, Now that your over me.
I know why, you're the one.
Now that your over me, 'Cause your my oxygen, Now that your over me, And I won't feel again.
