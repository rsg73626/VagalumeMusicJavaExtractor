DIVIDE THE BLACKENED SKY

I'm underground
Without a sound
Too hard to face
My fall from grace
Can I create
Another fate
Will I become
No one?

It's been so long
I've been searching for the sun
My world is going numb
But I will over come
'cause I know that I'm right where I belong
You think my days are done
But I will prove you wrong
'cause I know that I'm right where I belong

So I divide the blackened sky
To try to find the light
It's been so long
I've been searching for the sun
My world is going numb
But I will over come
'cause I know that I'm right where I belong
You think my days are done
But I will prove you wrong
'cause I know that I'm right where I belong

(right where I belong) (x2)

Now I'm falling out of this hole in the earth
'cause I've had enough, I'm feeling less than a word
I reach out from the dark
I've been searching for the sun
The world is going numb
But I will over come
'cause I know that I'm right where I belong

You think my days my days are done
But I will prove you wrong
'cause I know I'm right where I belong

I will over come
(where I belong)
I will prove you wrong
(where I belong)
So I divide the blackened sky
To try to find
Right where I belong!
