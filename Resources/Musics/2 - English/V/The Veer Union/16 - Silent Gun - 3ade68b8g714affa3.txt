SILENT GUN

I reside the vacant sides as the sky turns gray
Paralyzed in my disguise I will fade away

Now I hide away from me
I cannot fight this disease

I fell into the cracks in my head that's where I lost it
That's where my world went wrong cause the night I crossed it
I couldn't stop there, cause my mind was gone
So my sadness
Has turned to madness
You know that I have become
The silent gun

What I thought was right turned out the light deep inside of me
Once was alive but can't revive what I use to be

Now I hide away from me
I can not fight this disease

I fell into the cracks in my head
That's where I lost it
That's where my world went wrong
Cause the night I crossed it
I couldn't stop there
Cause my mind was gone
So my sadness
Has turned to madness
You know that I have become
The silent gun

I fell into the cracks in my head that's where I lost it
That's where my world went wrong cause the night I crossed it
I couldn't stop there, cause my mind was gone
So my sadness
Has turned to madness
You know that I have become
The silent gun
Facing me, silent gun, facing me,
Silent gun
