DARKER SIDE OF ME

Try- you try to get to know me.
But the one you want, I won't be.
I'm half the man that you think that I have been.

My- The words are full of nothing.
Still you search for something.
In the moments that I've probably forgotten.

Inside there's someone you don't want to know.

I don't think that you wanna be a part of me.
I don't think you wanna see the deeper, darker side of me.
I don't think that you're ready for reality.
I don't think you wanna see the deeper, darker side of me.

(Walk away)

I- find a sense of satisfaction.
In a one-night stand of passion.
I'm half the man that you think that I have been.

Inside there's someone you don't want to know.

I don't think that you wanna be a part of me.
I don't think you wanna see the deeper, darker side of me.
I don't think that you're ready for reality.
I don't think you wanna see the deeper, darker side of me.

(Walk away)
Can you trust me?
(Walk away)
I'm empty.
(Walk away)
Cause I might still be here.
Living hell
Might, be, living hell.
Might, be-
