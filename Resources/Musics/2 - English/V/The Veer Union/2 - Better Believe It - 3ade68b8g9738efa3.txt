BETTER BELIEVE IT

This message is your final lesson
Time to test your comprehension
Here before you lies the puzzle
Whats the nest piece that should follow
I might have forgot to mention you must watch for misdirection
This is what you're wanting to be
Why don't you just try and trust me

You don't want what
I have offered up
But I have lived through
The life that you want to

You better believe it
To see it
Do you understand?
You better believe it
To see it
Do you understand?
Now if you don't want to be living without
And you don't want to be living in doubt
In a world that could just fall apart
And your dream could come to end
You better believe it

Heres the answer to your question
This will be my last suggestion
This is what you're wanting to be
Why don't you just try and trust me

You dont want what
I have offered up
But I have lived through
The life that you want to

You better believe it
To see it
Do you understand?
You better believe it
To see it
Do you understand?
Now if you don't want to be living without
And you don't want to be living in doubt
In a world that could just fall apart
And your dream could come to end
You better believe it

You better believe it

You better believe it

In a world that could just fall apart
And your dream could come to end

You better believe it
To see it
Do you understand?
You better believe it
To see it
Do you understand?

And you don't want to be living in doubt
In a world that could just fall apart
And your dream could come to end
You better believe it
