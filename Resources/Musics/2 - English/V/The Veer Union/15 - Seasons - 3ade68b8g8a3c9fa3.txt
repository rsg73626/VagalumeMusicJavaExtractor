SEASONS

Back and forth you wonder through your mind
winters passing over but it wont find you

take what you can
change the seasons

Isolate yourself and you will find
There's no rhyme or reason
That it wont find you

Take what you can
Change the seasons
The changing of the seasons is you now
The changing of the seasons is you now
Is you now

Back and forth you wonder through your mind
Winters passing over but i don't mind
Branches that youre under will subside
Theres no time to ponder cause it wont find you

take what you can, change the seasons
the changing of the seasons is you now
the changing of the seasons is you now
Is you now

And i will find you although i wonder
If i will climb through
This work among them

I'm turning the page for something new
I'm finding my way through life it blew

the changing of the seasons is you now
the changing of the seasons is you now,
Is you now
Is you now

I'm turning the page for something new
I'm finding my way through life it blew
