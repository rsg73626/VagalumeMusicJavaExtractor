BREATHING IN

Don't let her down
Find your ground
Facing the world from upside down
Won't let her know
Move in slow
Cast on the walls my shadow

I can feel myself again

Don't let it slip away
Breathing in the day
Healing once again
Breathing in you

Don't let it slip away
Breathing in the day
Healing once again
Breathing in you

Don't let it go
Call don't fold
Seems as if we've lost control
Dream for a day
On my knees I pray
For things that have all been washed away

I can feel myself again

Don't let it slip away
Breathing in the day
Healing once again
Breathing in you

Don't let it slip away
Breathing in the day
Healing once again
Breathing in you

I'm breathing in you

Fall away, from the ground
Tell myself to come back

Don't let it slip away
Breathing in the day
Healing once again
Breathing in you

Don't let it slip away
Breathing in the day
Healing once again
I"m breathing in you

Keep breathing in
Keep breathing in
Keep breathing in
Now I'm breathing in you
Don't let it slip away
I'm breathing in you
Don't let it slip away
