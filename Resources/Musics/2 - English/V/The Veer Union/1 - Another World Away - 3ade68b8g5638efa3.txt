ANOTHER WORLD AWAY

Forgotten, the reasons why we have nothing.
Saving ourselves from nothing.
Shedding our pasts from everything now.

(we need love)
But we cannot figure out
(somethings wrong)
We cannot live without

Will you follow me to another world away from,
The nothingness in this one. what have we become?
(are we losing everything?)
Can you see we are slowly coming undone,
Divided we will become where can we be one?
In another world away
(yeahyeah)

We're counting, on others to do the right thing,
So where could they all be hiding?
They never seem to be anywhere around

(we need love)
But we cannot figure out
(somethings wrong)
We cannot live without

Will you follow me to another world away from,
The nothingness in this one. what have we become?
(are we losing everything?)
Can you see we are slowly coming undone,
Divided we will become where can we be one?
In another world away
(yeahyeah)

(another world away..)
(another world away!)
(another world away!)

Will you follow me to another world away from,
The nothingness in this one. what have we become?
(are we losing everything?)
Can you see we are slowly coming undone,
Divided we will become where can we be one?
In another world away
(yeahyeah)

To another world away...
(yeahyeah)
To another world away...
(yeahyeah)
To another world away...
(yeahyeah)
