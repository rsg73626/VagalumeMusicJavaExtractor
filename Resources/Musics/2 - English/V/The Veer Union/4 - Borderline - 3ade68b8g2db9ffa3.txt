BORDERLINE

I'm tired of being told to bite my tongue
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs

Try, to speak, out loud, you silence me but now
I'll stand my ground, I'll let you know that

I'm tired of being told to bite my tongue
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs.
It's like a nightmare but I'm lying awake,
It's got me thinking that I am...

Borderline
About to loose my mind
It's time to face my fear,
And then I will make it disappear.

The war in me, you set this thing to die
You set it free, I'll let you know that

I'm tired of being told to bite my tongue
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs.
It's like a nightmare but I'm lying awake
It's got me thinking that I am...

Borderline
About to loose my mind
It's time to face my fear,
And then I will make it disappear.
Disappear.

I'm tired of being told to bite my tongue
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It's like a nightmare but I'm lying awake
It's got me thinking that I am...

Borderline
About to loose my mind
And now you will see your time has come,
Pay for all this damage done
Face my fear and then I will,
Make it disappear
Disappear.
