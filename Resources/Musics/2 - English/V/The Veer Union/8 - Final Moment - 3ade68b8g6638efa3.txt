FINAL MOMENT

This is the final moment
Broke and bruised from fighting for it

Taste temptation
Changing the fate of a fallen man
I won't fall again
Save myself and
Rewrite the way it's supposed to end
It's supposed to end

And I won't wait 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow may never come, come

This is the final moment
Broke and bruised from fighting for it
This is the final moment
Focused in so I won't blow it

I'll be okay
This is the day I will start to live
I will start to live
Break my boundaries
I will awake to where I began
To where I began

And I won't wait 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow may never come, come

This is the final moment
Broke and bruised from fighting for it
This is the final moment
Focused in so I won't blow it

I'll sleep with one eye open
I'll sleep with one eye open
Focus

I'm finally in this moment

This is the final moment
Broke and bruised from fighting for it
This is the final moment
Focused in so I won't blow it

I'll sleep with one eye open
I'll sleep with one eye open
Moment, final moment, final moment
It's time to break away from this
