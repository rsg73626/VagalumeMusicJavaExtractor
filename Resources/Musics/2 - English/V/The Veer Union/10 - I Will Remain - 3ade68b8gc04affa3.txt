I WILL REMAIN

You forced me into broken dreams.
The world as I know has been torn from the seams
I tried looking up but I'm face down.
All I can taste is the dirt from the ground.

But I will remain.
I've come undone, now you've won
I feel my life crashing down onto me
The sun is gone, shadows on.
You think my world, you will take it from me
But I'll start again

I will remain.

Now that the dust is settling,
I find all the answers are unraveling
I'm falling apart, as you can see.
I pick up the pieces of what's left of me.

And I will stay right here, stay right here
One day you will be the one that's ending here.
Come back again, come back again.
One day you will be the one that's ending here.

I will remain.
I will remain.
