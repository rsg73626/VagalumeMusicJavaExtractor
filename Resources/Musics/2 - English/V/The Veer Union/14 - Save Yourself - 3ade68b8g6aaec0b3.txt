SAVE YOURSELF

Here comes the rain again, it's rolling in
Until it's pouring in your head
Just when you had thought you gained control
On solid ground you stand, it turns to sand
And swallows you again
Just when you finally thought you had it all

You must burn like the sun
Not the star that's fallen
You must turn from the gun
So you can save yourself

Save yourself, yourself from you
'Cause you're never enough for you
Save yourself, yourself from you
'Cause you're never enough for you

You're just an angel with a broken wing
But you will fly again
The devil always comes to test us all

You must burn like the sun
Not the star that's fallen
You must turn from the gun
So you can save yourself

Save yourself, yourself from you
'Cause you're never enough for you
Save yourself, yourself from you
'Cause you're never enough for you

And you'll find yourself confused
'Cause your mind has been abused
From inside you'll have to choose
So you might as well

Save yourself, yourself from you
'Cause you're never enough for you
Save yourself, yourself from you
'Cause you're never enough for you

Here comes the rain again for you
Here comes the rain again (So save yourself)
