INSIDE OUR SCARS

Getting times to one to undone
Blinkin' eye, you can't let go
Can we revive another life?
Or is it done?

Another day to fall away from
The memories when we were one
I'mma show the resecure
Can this be undone?
Where did we go wrong?
One more time I rawl

Cause
There's a war between our words again
Cause you only believe me now and then
But I need you to know you've always been
The reason that I breath oxygen
Why can't you believe me?
So close but yet so far
We have lost who were are
So close but yet so far
We are lost inside our scars. (inside our scars)

Bring the man, this come again
I guess that's the price we pay
Still I've been the one who rends

Can this be undone?
Where did we go wrong?
One more time I rawl
Cause there's a war between our words again
Cause you only believe

Cause
There's a war between our words again
Cause you only believe me now and then
But I need you to know you've always been
The reason that I breath oxygen

Why can't you believe me?
So close but yet so far
We have lost who we are
So close but yet so far
We are lost inside our scars

Inside our scars!

One more time I rawl
Cause
There's a war between our words again
Cause you only believe me now and then
But I need you to know you've always been
The reason that I breath oxygen
Why can't you believe me?
So close but yet so far
We have lost who were are
So close but yet so far
We are lost inside our scars.
Inside our scars.
Inside our scars. (x2)
Blinkin' eye, remember? gone.
