YOUR LOVE KILLS ME

I feel you run right through my veins
I can't get enough, my head's in a haze
Addicted to you, you're my disease
You take over me

I burn like the sun and sweat like the sea
You're a loaded gun pointed at me
Addicted to you, you're what I need
You're my disease, you take over me

But I've had enough and now I finally see

It's time for me
It's time that I try to move on
Before your love kills me
And I'll break free
From all of the damage you've done
Before your love kills me (kills me)

I slowly drown as you pour into me
I swallow it down, I'm in too deep
Addicted to you, you're what I need
You're my disease, you take over me

But I've had enough and now I finally see

It's time for me
It's time that I try to move on
Before your love kills me
And I'll break free
From all of the damage you've done
Before your love kills me

I will leave it all behind me
The memories of you remind me
I have to let go
'cause you dug me this hole
You've taken more than you know
So I have to let go, of you

It's time for me
It's time that I try to move on
Before your love kills me

And I'll break free
From all of the damage you've done
Before your love kills me

It's time for me
It's time that I try to move on
It's time that I try to move on

I have to let go
'cause you dug me this hole
(it's time that I try to move on)
You've taken more than you know
So I have to let go
(it's time that I try to move on)
I have to let go (let go)
'cause you dug me this hole
You've taken more than you know
So I have to let go
It's time that I try to move on
