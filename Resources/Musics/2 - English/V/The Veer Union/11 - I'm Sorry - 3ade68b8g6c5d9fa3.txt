I'M SORRY

For you it's hard to say, "I'm sorry."
You know it's just the same for me.
Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye, my friend.
You think you're not to blame for this.
I'm feeling just the same: hopeless.
Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye.

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry for seeing, the side of you that is oh, so deceiving.
All I see, all the lies I believed in.
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.

I thought you would have changed by now.
You fooled me once again, somehow.
Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye, my friend.
I always rearrange my life, now all I've got to say is
goodbye. Goodbye.

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry for seeing, the side of you that is oh, so deceiving.
All I see, all the lies I believed in.
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry, I really mean it!
So this ends, and I'm walking out the front door.
Now I know that there's nothing left to fight for.
Every time I open my eyes.

For you it's hard to say, "I'm sorry."
You know it's just the same for me.

The side of you that is oh, so deceiving!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry for seeing, the side of you that is oh, so deceiving.
All I see, all the lies I believed in.
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry, I really mean it!
So this ends, now I'm walking out the door. 
Now I'm walking out the door.
I know there's nothing left for me to fight for!
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry, I really mean it.
Now that I have opened my eyes.
