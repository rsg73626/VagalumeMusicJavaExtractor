YOUTH OF YESTERDAY

Your always ending up at the bottom
(Thinking it over, you're thinking it over)
The life you've given up left you hollow
(Its too late to start over)

Don't you know you're right here on the stake
(Don't blame me)
You are the youth of yesterday
(Don't take it out on me)
We are the youth of our day
(Don't take it out)

You stumble through the land
The land of us and broken dreams
Can't you see your bottled up beyond belief
Don't blame me, Don't blame me

Another day has come time for healing
(Thinking it over, you're thinking it over)
You hear past away now it's revealing
(It's too late to start over)

Don't you know you're right here on the stake
(Don't blame me)
You are the youth of yesterday
(Don't take it out on me)
We are the youth of our day
(Don't take it out)

You stumble through the land
The land of us and broken dreams
Can't you see your bottled up beyond belief
Don't blame me, Don't blame me

You are the youth of yesterday
(Sorry)
I feel sorry
(Sorry)
'Cause this the life you've wasted
And you are the one to blame for it
(Don't take it out on me)
'Cause you are the one to blame for it

You are the youth of yesterday
(Don't take it out on me)
We are the youth of our day
(Don't take it out)


You stumble through the land
The land of us and broken dreams
Can't you see your bottled up beyond belief
Don't blame me, Don't blame me
