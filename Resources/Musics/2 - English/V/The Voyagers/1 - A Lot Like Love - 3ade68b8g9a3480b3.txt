A LOT LIKE LOVE

You could be the one that I'm fighting for
But you leave me here, leave me wanting more
Why you'd tell me no why you're holding off
Cause everything we do
Everything we do, it's a lot like love

What you're waiting for
Never hurt my soul, not like this before
I just gotta know what you're holding off
Cause everything we do
Everything we do, it's a lot like love

A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love

Cause everything we do, it's a lot like love
Everybody knows nothing is meant to be
One and one is two so why can't you see
Why you'd tell me no why you're holding off
Cause everything we do
Everything we do, it's a lot like love

What you're waiting for
Never hurt my soul, not like this before
I just gotta know what you're holding off
Cause everything we do
Everything we do, it's a lot like love

A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
A lot like love
Cause everything we do, it's a lot like love
Cause everything we do, it's a lot like love
