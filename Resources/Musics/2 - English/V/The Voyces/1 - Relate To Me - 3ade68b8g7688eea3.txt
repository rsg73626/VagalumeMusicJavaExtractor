RELATE TO ME

Oh, the night's so young
It's been so long since I had any fun
I don't know what's wrong
I just wanna play another song
When the seasons change, leaves will still be blowing through my brain

Can you feel your heart ache? Do you relate to me?

In an empty home, the man inside it never feels alone
'Cause when he holds the light he knows there's nothing that he has to fight

Can you feel your heart ache? Do you relate to me?
