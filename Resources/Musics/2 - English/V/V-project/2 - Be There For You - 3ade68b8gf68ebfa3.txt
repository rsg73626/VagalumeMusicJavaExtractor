BE THERE FOR YOU

Yes I would like to
Yes if you want to
Yes that would be nice
Anything that you do.

Make me believe all that you give is you.

Show me the heart
Show me the soul
Show me the way 
For me to make you whole.
Woman and man, since time began, uh-hu.

I know that this is just begining to grow
but it could last a life time.

All that you want, all that you need
Everything and everywhere I'll be there for you.
All the tears you'll cry, all for you and I.
Allways and ever I will be there for you ya-

Love can be happy
Love can be cruel
Love can be selfish
Forgive me I'm a fool
Make me believe that love love love love 
Love is cool.

Kiss me good-morning
Kiss me good-night
Kiss me all over
Kiss me kiss me till it's right.
Secrets unfold so precious to behold.

True love may not be the answer to give
But I won't stop trying.

All that you want, all that you need
Everything and everywhere I'll be there for you.
All the tears you'll cry, all for you and I.
Allways and ever I will be there for you ya-


Sometimes we never know
If letting go will end in tears.
You have to trust yourself.

All that you want, all that you need
Everything and everywhere I'll be there for you.
All the tears you'll cry, all for you and I.
Allways and ever I will be there for you

All that you want, all that you need
Everything and everywhere I'll be there for you.
All the tears you'll cry, all for you and I.
Allways and ever I will be there for you ya-

Be there for you yeah

Be there for you yeah
