ONLY FRIEND

Why can't I do anything
To satisfy the hunger that
I feel inside is killing me
I don't know why it's happening
To me the fear won't disappear
I've struggled hard, delusions I can't hide

If the world came crashing down
Everytime I looked around
I know I'd find in you
Safe haven from the blue
Protecting me and you...

My only friend, I know I can depend
On you my only friend,I know I can depend

Why can't I remember when
The things that seemed important then
And why do I like seasons change
I rearrange the picture once again

If I could I'd be like you
Where would that lead me to
In times when I am lost
The strenght I need to cross
I'd find it all in you....

My only friend, I know I can depend
On you my only friend,I know I can depend

If the world came crashing down
Everytime I looked around
Put all my faith in you....

My only friend, I know I can depend
On you my only friend,I know I can depend

My only friend, I know I can depend
On you my only friend,I know I can depend
