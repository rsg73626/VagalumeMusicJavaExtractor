ALL OVER AGAIN

Every day I feel the hole in my heart.
And I know it's my fault,
cause the life that I lead is so very hard.

I know we agreed to give it some time.
But it's love that I need and with out you,
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

If we pull close together and we open our hearts,
is there a chance that we might fall in love.
If we say it's forever and we make a new start,
is there a chance that we might fall in love,
all over again.

So many smoke filled nights,
and bar room fights, have really got me down.
And it just isn't fair,
that the time we could share,
has wound up in the lost and found.

I know we agreed to give it some time.
But it's love that I need and with out you,
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

If we pull close together and we open our hearts,
is there a chance that we might fall in love.
If we say it's forever and we make a new start,
is there a chance that we might fall in love,
all over again.

Maybe it's better,
if we try to stand on our own.
But if you feel the way I do,
Then darling please come home.

I know we agreed to give it some time.
But it's love that I need and with out you,
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

If we pull close together and we open our hearts,
is there a chance that we might fall in love.
If we say it's forever and we make a new start,
is there a chance that we might fall in love,
all over again…

We're gonna make it this time.
This time we'll last forever…
