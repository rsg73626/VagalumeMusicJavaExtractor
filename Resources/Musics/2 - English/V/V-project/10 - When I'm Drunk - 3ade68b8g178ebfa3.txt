WHEN I'M DRUNK

Seventeen gettin older
Packed my bags and I left to moved in with the queen
She gave me shelter
And all that I needed to keep me nose clean
I never met her
She waved several times until I cracked a smile
Then she sent me a letter
Saying you've been avoidin the tax man for quite a long while

When I'm drunk, I'm drunk
As drunk as I can be
That's when I see more, much more of you than I should see
When I'm drunk

I lay low for a while
Hopin my name would get lost in that great big pile
Till they knocked on me door
I couldn't escape from her clutches no more
Just give me a minute
So I grabbed me old bag and I threw some things in it
Jumped over the wall
And I ran like the devil until I reached the north wall.

When I'm drunk, I'm drunk
As drunk as I can be
That's when I see more, much more of you than I should see

Oh, what have I got to lose?
When I sober, all I do is read the bad news

When I'm drunk, I'm drunk
As drunk as I can be
That's when I see more, much more of you than I should see
And
When I'm drunk, I'm drunk
As drunk as I can be
That's when I see more, much more of you than I should see
When I'm drunk
When I'm drunk
