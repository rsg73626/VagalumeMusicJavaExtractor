COUPE DEVILLE

Take me back to yesterday
Thinkin bout the times that got away
Moterin around on Derby Hill
Ain't been back in oh so long
Now my old friends are dead or gone
All I've got now are memories

And it takes me back to the way things used to be
Drivin round those city streets
And I miss that now 
When time was standin still
In Michael's Coupe Deville

Jimmy he got thrown in jail
Not a one of us could make the bail
Back when gasoline was almost free
Well, I went back in 92
Wasn't much there for me to do
Ain't nothin here to make me stay


And it takes me back to the way things used to be
Drivin round those city streets
And I miss that now 
When time was standin still
In Michael's Coupe Deville

Don't be lonely, you're not the only one
They say, tomorrow starts right here, today

And it takes me back to the way things used to be
Drivin round those city streets
And I miss that now 
When time was standin still
In Michael's Coupe Deville
