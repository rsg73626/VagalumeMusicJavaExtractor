THE GOOD TIMES

Do you remember when you were a child,
All you had to do was, cry a little
For what you wanted, what you needed,
To take your pain away.
Not much has changed, your still the same
You still cry, whenever I 
Don't understand you, the way I used to
Always share the blame.

I don't know what I was thinking
All I know, it's you I'm missing
Lookin back we really, had the good times.

Those were the good times.

If I live to be a hundred or just one day more
My dying wish would be to love you more
I'm crazy for you, what can I do, lonely!
From the last day of summer to the first day of fall
I'll always remember the way you called me baby,
baby, my baby.

Everyday I think about you
Everynight can't sleep without you
Looking back we really, had the good times.

Those were the good times.

Where to go with my dreams
Time will tell oh!
Can't go back! Can't go on!!

I don't know what I was thinking
All I know, it's you I'm missing
Lookin back we really, had the good times.

Those were the good times.
