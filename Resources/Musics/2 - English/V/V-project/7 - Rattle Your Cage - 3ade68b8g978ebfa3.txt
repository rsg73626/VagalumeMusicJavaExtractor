RATTLE YOUR CAGE

Born rich it's been a real bitch
They took your fancy clothes and model pose
You've got passions for all the latest toys

Rehab made you feel drab
They took your little pills and windowsills
Not gonna hold your hand while you self destruct

I'm gonna rattle your cage
Rockin your little world
rattle your cage
Rockin your little world

Endless greed don't feel a real need
There ain't no dollar sign on piece of mind
Angels fly wearing hand me downs

You're on the ground floor
You're in an up-roar
You're like a falling star when it falls too far
Mesmerized by your looking glass

I'm gonna rattle your cage
Rockin your little world
Rattle your cage
Rockin your little world

Come with me and say goodbye to your broken world
Follow me to paradise, you've got to trust it girl

Oh - Hold on tight
Oh - feel the night

I'm gonna rattle your cage
Rockin your little world
Rattle your cage
Rockin your little world
