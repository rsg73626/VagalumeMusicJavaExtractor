CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER

Tell me a story, of love and of kings,
make me believe everything.
Build me a dream, where a wish can come true,
and I'll make a wish just for you.

This heart can't resist you.
These lips already miss you.

And I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait any longer.
I need to show you what I'm feeling for you, now.

Teach me the good things, your love has to give.
Hide me from sorrow and pain.
Feed all my hunger with your ravage embrace.
Smother this love with your kiss.

There's passion within me,
with all its insanity.

And I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait any longer.
I need to show you what I'm feeling for you, now.

I could move mountains just thinking of you.
From morning till night, that's what I would do.
Cause your all I need.
When you bleed, I bleed.

Tell me a story, of love and of kings.
Make me believe. 
Make me believe everything.

And I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait any longer.
I need to show you what I'm feeling for you, 

And I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait any longer.
I need to show you what I'm feeling for you,

And I can't wait any longer,
I can't waitâ€¦
