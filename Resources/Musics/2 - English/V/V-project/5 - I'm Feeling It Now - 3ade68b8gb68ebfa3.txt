I'M FEELING IT NOW

Tell me my only friend,
these four walls are closing in.
Darkness and light depend,
a state of mind that I am in.
Curse the anger and feel the pain,
won't let it happen...to me again.

I'm feelin, I'm feelin, I'm feelin it now.
Oh, I'm feelin, I'm feelin, I'm feelin it now.

I'm never satisfied,
but if you fall at least give it all.
Be willing to sacrifice,
don't say no without thinking twice.
Foolin myself, foolin myself,
you were never on my mind.
And I don't believe that I,
gave a damn about what you do,
or what you say, makes no difference either way.
Just didn't feel it.

But I'm feelin, I'm feelin, I'm feelin it now. 
Oh, I'm feelin, I'm feelin, I'm feelin it now.

I let you in it's suicide, it's alright, it's alright.
Did not want to compromise, no matter how I tried.
Feelings come and feelings go,
I let you in and then I let you go...

I curse the anger and feel the pain,
won't let it happen...to me again.

I'm feelin, I'm feelin, I'm feelin it now.
Oh, I'm feelin, I'm feelin, I'm feelin it now....
