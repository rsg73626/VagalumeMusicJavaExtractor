TRIPPIN' AWAY

It's 8:00 A.M.
The weekend ends
The sun it shines
The radio is blowin
Right through my mind

The feelings gone
What I was on
It's time to wake
Get out of bed
And feed my head
So late

I see the writing on the wall
How can it be wrong when I feel, ten feet tall

Trippin' away
Trippin' away on the stone that got me here
Trippin' away

(repeat chorus)

So late for this
So late for that
The phone rings off the wall
To hell I say 
For those who wait
For me to fall

Took twenty years
To get me here
Now I'm on top
Although it's wrong
I'm to far gone
To stop

I see the writing on the wall
I'll take the risk, when I take the fall

Trippin' away
Trippin' away on the stone that got me here
Trippin' away

(repeat chorus)



I see a change coming on 
Someday for me
But for now I'm too far gone 

Trippin' away
Trippin' away on the stone that got me here
Trippin' away

(repeat chorus)

(repeat chorus)
