TUMBLING DOWN

Gee, but it's hard when one lowers one's guard to the vultures
Not me, I regard it a tortuous hardship that smoulders
like a peppermint eaten away
will fight, will i swagger or sway?
Hee, hee, M'Lady, she cries like a baby to scold us
see her tumbling down, tumbling down (x2)

Hail! to the monkey; we're having a funky reunion
Wasted and sunk, he can only have Sunday communion
he got nicotine stains in his eyes
he got nothing to protect but his pride
Oh! smother the kiss or be drownded in blissful confusion
see her tumbling down, tumbling down (x4)
