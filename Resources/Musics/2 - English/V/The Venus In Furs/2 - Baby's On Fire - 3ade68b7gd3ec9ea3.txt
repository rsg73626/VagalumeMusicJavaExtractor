BABY'S ON FIRE

Baby's on fire 
Better throw her in the water 
Look at her laughing 
Like a heifer to the slaughter 

Baby's on fire 
And all the laughing boys are bitching 
Waiting for photos 
Oh the plot is so bewitching 

Rescuers row row 
Do your best to change the subject 
Blow the wind blow blow 
Lend some assistance to the object 

Photographers snip snap 
Take your time she's only burning 
This kind of experience 
Is necessary for her learning 

If you'll be my flotsam 
I could be half the man I used to 
They said you were hot stuff 
And that's what Baby's been reduced to...

Juanita and Juan 
Very clever with maraccas 
Making their fortunes 
Selling second-hand tobaccoes 

Juan dances at Chico's 
And when the clients are evicted 
He empties the ashtrays 
And pockets all that he's collected 

But Baby's on fire! 
And all the instruments agree that 
Her temperature's rising 
But any idiot would know that.
