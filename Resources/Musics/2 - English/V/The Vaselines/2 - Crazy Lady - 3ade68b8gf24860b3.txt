CRAZY LADY

If you'd know what I've been thinking
It's no use if we're pretending
Who do you think is keeping score?
So what if it's all been said before?
What was the point? What were we fighting for?

Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
When you're walking away it's so easy
When you're away I don't feel down
When you're walking away it's so easy

If you'd know why I've been busy
Now I'm clean, but you're still easy
When did we stop? When did we fall?
The other days we had it all
What was the point? What were we fighting for?

Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
When you're walking away it's so easy
When you're away I don't feel down
When you're walking away it's so easy

Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
Goodbye, Crazy Lady! I'm over you
