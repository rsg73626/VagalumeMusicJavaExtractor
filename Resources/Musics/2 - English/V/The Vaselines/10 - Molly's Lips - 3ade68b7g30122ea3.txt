MOLLY'S LIPS

She said she'll take me anyway,
She'll take me everyway,
As long as she stays with me.

She said she'll take me everywhere,
She'll take me anywhere,
As long as I'm good and clean.

Kiss kiss Molly's lips
Kiss kiss Molly's lips
Kiss kiss Molly's lips
Kiss kiss Molly's lips

She said she'll take me everytime,
She'll take me anytime,
As long as she stays with me.

She said she'll take me everyday,
She'll take me anyday,
And it would be free..
