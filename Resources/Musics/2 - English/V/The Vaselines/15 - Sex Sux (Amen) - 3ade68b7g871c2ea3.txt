SEX SUX (AMEN)

I was born up an original sin,
Brought my two time in her slim virgin,
Father, Son and the Holy Ghost,
I'm the Sacred host, with the most.

I was born on Christmas day,
And all my people turned me away.

They said I'd be the one,
Borrow the life of the chosen son,
Doing the cross was not for me,
It's human life of chastity.

I was born on Christmas day,
And all my people turned me away.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

I got one thing to say, SEX SUX AMEN!
