DISTANCE -  CHRISTINA PERRI

The sun is filling up the room
And I can hear you dreaming
Do you feel the way I do right now?
I wish we would just give up
'Cause the best part is falling
Call it anything but love

And I will make sure to keep my distance
Say "I love you" and you're not listening
How long can we keep this up, up, up?

And please don't stand so close to me
I'm having trouble breathing
I'm afraid of what you'll see right now
I give you everything I am
All my broken heartbeats
Until I know you understand

And I will make sure to keep my distance
Say "I love you" and you're not listening
How long can we keep this up, up, up?

And I keep waiting
For you to take me
You keep waiting
To say what we have

So I make sure to keep my distance
Say "I love you" and you're not listening
How long can we keep this up, up, up?

Make sure to keep my distance
Say "I love you" and you're not listening
How long til we call this love, love, love?
