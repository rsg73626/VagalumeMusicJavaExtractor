TURN IT BACK - NIK AMMAR

All that was certain
Succumbed to the flame.
In the space of a heartbeat,
Everything changed.
At the crossroads was the gate,
The window to my fate.
The angel that secured me is love.
High and above my soul, (?)
The demons took control,
And he watched the fire rage from above.

Turn it back. turn it back.
Turn back the hand of time.
Turn it back. turn it back
To the days when you were mine.
Turn it back. turn it back.
Turn back the hand of time.
Turn it back. turn it back
To the days when you were mine.

Whoa (4x)

Ahead in the distance,
Fire and ice;
An in-between water flow carrying
Virtue and vice.
And all the little streams
Witched every harbored dream, (?)
And the river chased me out to the sea.
And I had the heart of time
And begged him not to try,
But to see what had become of me. (?)

Whoa (8x)
