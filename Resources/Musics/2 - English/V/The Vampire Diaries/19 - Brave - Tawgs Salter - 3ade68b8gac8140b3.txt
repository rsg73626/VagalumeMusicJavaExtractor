BRAVE - TAWGS SALTER

I think I'll be brave
Starting with you
But I'll fall away if you tell me to
I'd rather be wrong
Then hope that I'm right
'Cause I can't go on with this all inside

I think I'll be brave
And say how I've wanted you

Going around inside my head
Trying to talk me out of it
So lonely... Too lonely
If there's a possibility
You turn and run away with me
I need to... To show you before it fades

I think I'll be brave
Starting with you
But I'll fall away if you tell me to
I'd rather be wrong
Than hope that I'm right
'Cause I can't go on with this all inside

I think I'll be brave
And say how I've wanted you

Over the bridge and down a ways
Far off ahead I see a face
I follow, it's swallows me
Where do i begin
Whenever you say you let me in
I need to... To show you before it fades

I think I'll be brave
Starting with you
But I'll fall away if you tell me to
I'd rather be worng
Than hope that I'm right
'Cause I can't go on with this all inside

I think I'll be brave
And say how I've wanted you

Say how I've wanted you
Say how I've wanted you
And say how I've wanted you

I think I'll be brave

Going around inside my head
Trying to talk me out of it
So lonely
