ECHO - JASON WALKER

Hello, hello
Anybody out there?
'cause i don't hear a sound
Alone, alone
I don't really know where the world is but i miss it now

I'm out on the edge and i'm screaming my name
Like a fool at the top of my lungs
Sometimes when i close my eyes i pretend i'm alright
But it's never enough
Cause my echo, echo
Is the only voice coming back
My shadow, shadow
Is the only friend that i have

Listen, listen
I would take a whisper if
That's all you have to give
But it isn't, isn't
You could come and save me
Try to chase it crazy right out of my head

I'm out on the edge and i'm screaming my name
Like a fool at the top of my lungs
Sometimes when i close my eyes i pretend i'm alright
But it's never enough
Cause my echo, echo
Is the only voice coming back
My shadow, shadow
Is the only friend that i have

I don't wanna be down and
I just wanna feel alive and
Get to see your face again once again
Just my echo, my shadow
Youre my only friend

I'm out on the edge and i'm screaming my name
Like a fool at the top of my lungs
Sometimes when i close my eyes i pretend i'm alright
But it's never enough
Cause my echo, echo
Oh my shadow, shadow

Hello, hello
Anybody out there?
