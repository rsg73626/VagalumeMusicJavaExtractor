ITS OVER - CLOONEY

You never closed your eyes
Whenever we would kiss
I'd catch you looking in the mirror
Was there something you missed?
You told me I was yours
You'd take me to another world
You told me I was beautiful
While staring at some other girl

I, I stuck around
Thought I could change you
Lost days and ground
Just trying to save you
Now it's time to save myself

It's over
Thank God it's over
Now I can breathe again
Feels like I'm free again
It's over
Thank God it's over
Never's too soon again
Until I see you again

Your favourite trick was to destroy
All the things I would enjoy
You were a faith-killing beer-swilling
Half empty kind of bitter boy
And I was your toy
Ir so you thought but no
I wanted more
I wanted love

That was the only thing you made me guilty of
But now I'm so far past, and now I'm so far done
My stuff is so packed up and now I'm so far gone
I feel the change
There's no denying
That it feels good
To see you crying
Delicious words inside my mouth

It's over
(It's over, it's over)
Thank God it's over
(It's over, it's over)
Now I can breathe again
(AAh)
Feel like I'm free again
(AAh)
It's over
(It's over, it's over)
Thank God it's over
(It's over, it's over)
Never's too soon again
Until I see you again, you, yeah

And now I'm vindicated
I'm liberated
I wake up exonerated
With the time to celebrate it
And I'm free to be me
Free to be myself and me
Free to be myself and me and I
Never tell the reason why
Yeah I'm just free to be
And I can breathe
Thank you for this
I want to thank you for this
To think I could have missed this
How good it feels
To be free
To be me
To be myself, yeah

It's over!
(It's over, it's over)
Thank God it's over!
(It's over, it's over)
Now I can breathe again
(AAh)
Feel like I'm free again, free again!

(AAh)
It's over!
(It's over, it's over)
Thank God it's over
(It's over, it's over)
Never's too soon again
Until I see you again
