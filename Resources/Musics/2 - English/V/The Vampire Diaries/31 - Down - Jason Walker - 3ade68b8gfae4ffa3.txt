DOWN - JASON WALKER

I don't know where I'm at
I'm standing at the back
And I'm tired of waiting
I'm waiting here in line
I'm hoping that I'll find
What I've been chasing

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
Its coming down, down, down.

I'm not ready to let go
Cause then I'd never know
What I could be missing.
But I'm missing way too much
So when do I give up
What I've been wishing for?

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
Its coming down, down, down.

Oh, I am going down, down, down.
I can't find another way around.
And I don't wanna hear that sound
Of losing what I never found.

I shot for the sky.
I'm stuck on the ground.
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
Its coming down, down, down.

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down.
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
Oh, its coming down, down, down
