UNBREAKABLE - JAMIE SCOTT

She finds it hard to trust someone
She's heard the words because they've all been sung
She's the girl in the corner
She's the girl nobody loved
But I can't, I can't, stop thinking about you every day
And you can't, you can't, listen to what people say
They don't know you baby
Don't know that you're amazing
But I'm here to stay

When you lose your way and the fight is gone
Your heart starts to break
And you need someone around
Close your eyes while I put my arms above you

And make you unbreakable
She stands in the rain just to hide it all
If you ever turn around, I won't let you fall down
I swear I'll find your smile
And put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

Because she's the girl that I never had
She's the heart that I wanted bad
The song I heard on the radio
That made me stop and think of her
And I can't, I can't, concentrate anymore
I need, I need, need to show her what her heart is for
It's been mistreated badly
Now her world is surely falling apart, falling apart

When you lose your way and the fight is gone
Your heart starts to break and you need someone around
Close your eyes while I put my arms above you
And make you unbreakable
She stands in the rain just to hide it all
If you ever turn around, I won't let you fall down
I swear I'll find your smile and put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

You need to know that somebody's there all the time
I'll wait in line, in the hope it shows
Can't walk away until your heart knows that it's beautiful
Oh, I hope you know, it's beautiful
When you lose your way and the fight is gone
Your heart starts to break and you need someone around
Close your eyes while I put my arms above you

And make you unbreakable
She stands in the rain just to hide it all
If you ever turn around, I won't let you fall down
I swear I'll find your smile and put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

Because I love, I love, I love, I love, I love you darling
Yes I love, I love, I love, I love, I love you darling
And I'll put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable
