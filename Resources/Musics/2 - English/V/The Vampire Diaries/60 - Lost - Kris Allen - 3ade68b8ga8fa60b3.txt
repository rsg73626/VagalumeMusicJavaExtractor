LOST - KRIS ALLEN

I want to thank you for all your help
Cause you're on to me, you're on to me, I know!
You tell me all the bad things I didn't know about myself
Yes, you're on to me, you're on to me, I know!

Maybe I'm lost, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm lost, maybe I'm lost
But at least I'm looking
But at least I'm looking

I wish the cat would get your tongue
Cause you're on to me, you're on to me!
You got your hands in your pocket and you pull out your wallet
With your two cents for everyone
Cause you're on to me, you're on to me, I know!

Maybe I'm lost, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm lost, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm lost, maybe I'm lost
But at least I'm looking
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Maybe I'm lost, oh, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm lost, maybe I'm lost
Cause you're not looking
Well, at least I'm looking
