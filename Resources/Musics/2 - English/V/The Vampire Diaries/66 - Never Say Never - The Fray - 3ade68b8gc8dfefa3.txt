NEVER SAY NEVER - THE FRAY

Some things we don't talk about,
Rather do without and just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of, together all the while
You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before

Don't let me go(x6)

Picture you're queen of everything
Far as the eye can see under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand
You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time, time and time again
Younger now than we were before

Don't let me go(x6)

We're pulling apart and coming together again and again
We're growing apart but we pull it together,
Pull it together again

Don't let me go(x12)
