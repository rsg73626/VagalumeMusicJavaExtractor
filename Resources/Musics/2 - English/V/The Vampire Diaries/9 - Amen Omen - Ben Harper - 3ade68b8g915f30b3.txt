AMEN OMEN - BEN HARPER

What started as a whisper
Slowly turned in to a scream
Searching for an answer
Where the question is unseen
I don't know where you came from
And I dont know where you've gone
Old friends become old strangers
Between darkness and the door

Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within
To live my life without you?

I still hear you saying
"All of life is chance
And is sweetest, is sweetest when at a glance"
But I live
I live a hundred lifetimes in a day
But I die a little
In every breath - that - I take

Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within
To live my life without you?

I listen to a whisper
Slowly drift away
Silence is the loudest
Parting word you never say
I put I put your world
Into my veins
Now a voiceless sympathy
Is all that remains

Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within
To live my life without you?

Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I (see your face again?) find the
place within

Amen omen, will (can I find the strength within) I see your
face again?
Amen omen, can I find the strength within

Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within
Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the strength within

Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen
