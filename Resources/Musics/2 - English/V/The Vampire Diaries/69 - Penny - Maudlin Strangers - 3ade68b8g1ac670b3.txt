PENNY - MAUDLIN STRANGERS

It's just one against the world
And everyday I hope that it will get better
No more wasting thoughts on her
I've bought her time and I've given her every penny

I paint her "lover"
A ruse for the comfort
Her smile makes you wonder
What blooms in the covers

I confess that I've been living inside your eyes
Let go and let paradise
When's a better time than now?
You put your hands
In my pockets while I taste your lips
& Then you start talking with your finger tips
We can't waste another minute off the ground
