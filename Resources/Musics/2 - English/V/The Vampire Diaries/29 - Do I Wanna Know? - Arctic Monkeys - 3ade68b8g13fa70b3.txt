DO I WANNA KNOW? - ARCTIC MONKEYS

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like something in your teeth
Are there some aces up your sleeve
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week

How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I've found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever though of calling when you've had a few?
Cause I always do
Baby, I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying

To kiss you
I don't know if you
Feel the same as I do
But we could be together
If you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (crawling back to you)
Ever though of calling when
You've had a few? (you've had a few?)
'Cause I always do (cause I always do)
Baby I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever though of calling, darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?
