HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOU?

How long do I have to wait for you honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Ooh baby tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Every hour seems like a day
And every day is like a year
And every week is an eternity
Well I get lonely baby when you're not here

Ooh baby tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Ooh baby tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Won't you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait
How long do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone

I ax'd your mama; I ax'd your papa
Your friends, your preacher and your boss
No one knows where you going to baby
Or if you're coming back to me
Or we're together or are we lost
Ooh baby, tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before a girl like me can move on

Ooh baby, tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone
Won't you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
Ooh baby, tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone

One
Won't you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how l
Ong I can wait

(Music)
Oh baby, tell me how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone, ahh

How long do you I have to wait for you honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby how long
Do you I have to wait for you honey
Before I can say that you're gone, yeah
How long, baby tell me, how long
