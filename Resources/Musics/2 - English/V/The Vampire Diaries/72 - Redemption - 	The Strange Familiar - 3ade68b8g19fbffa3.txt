REDEMPTION - 	THE STRANGE FAMILIAR

The night is slowly closing
But my eyes are slowly opened
And I see that somewhere in you
There is a good heart
There is a good soul

For everyone lost in the silence
For every one missing piece
For every will that is broken
No matter how dark it may be
There is redemption

I feel the threat of thunder
But this rain can't last forever
The light chases the dark
Where there's a good heart
There is a good soul

For everyone lost in the silence
For every one missing piece
For every will that is broken
No matter how dark it may be
There is redemption
There is redemption

For everyone lost in the silence
There is redemption
