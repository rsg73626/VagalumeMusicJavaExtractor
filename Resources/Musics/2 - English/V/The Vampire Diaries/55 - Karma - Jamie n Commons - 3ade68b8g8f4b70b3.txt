KARMA - JAMIE N COMMONS

Ahh ahh Hey hey
Ahh ahh Hey hey
I heard all I needed
Cannot fight the signs
I could taste the blood there
I could taste the lies

I can see the sorrow
I can find the line
See the angel of death there
She's slowly coming to town
Just when you thought that the war was won
Just when you thought the race was done
It's coming back 'round, it's coming back 'round
It's coming back 'round to get you

Karma, Karma
What goes around comes back around
So when I see you again, I'm gonna put you down
Karma, Karma
What goes around comes back around
So when I see you again, I'm gonna put you down

Why don't you hold your answer?
Why don't you take your stance?
You should have let me die there
You should have took your chance
I feel a turning in tide now
I feel it fade to black
I take the sun from your stars
Now you give me back

Just when you thought that the war was won
Just when you thought the race was done
It's coming back 'round, it's coming back 'round
It's coming back 'round to get you

Karma, Karma
What goes around comes back around
So when I see you again, I'm gonna put you down
Karma, Karma
What goes around comes back around
So when I see you again, I'm gonna put you down

Karma, Karma
What goes around comes back around
So when I see you again, I'm gonna put you down
Karma, Karma
What goes around comes back around
So when I see you again, I'm gonna put you down
