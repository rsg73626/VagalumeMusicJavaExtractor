ALL YOU WANTED - 	SOUNDS UNDER RADIO

I am the fold, in the wake
Watch me push her back and break
I lose all my friends, and wash away
All the fractures Ive displayed

But we still, hold on

Cause it was
All you wanted
And all I needed
But all I gave up, now
Could you hold me tighter
When worlds collide
Just hold me down right now

All these lines, in the air
I dont know if anyone would care
Im losing my friends, in the wave
Of all these fragments I cant fake

But we still, hold on

Cause it was
All you wanted
And all I needed
But all I gave up, now
Could you hold me tighter
When worlds collide
Just hold me down right now

Pull me in
Drown my fear
Could you wait another day,
knowing that Ill come back
Ill come back no fear

Cause it was
All you wanted
And all I needed
But all I gave up, now
Could you hold me tighter
When worlds collide
Just hold me down right now
