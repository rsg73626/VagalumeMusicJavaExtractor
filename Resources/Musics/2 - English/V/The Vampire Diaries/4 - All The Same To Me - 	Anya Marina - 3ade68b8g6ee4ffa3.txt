ALL THE SAME TO ME - 	ANYA MARINA

I won't run when the sky turns to flame
And i sure won't budge when the earth does shake
When the flood comes up, i will dance in the rain
'cause it's all the same to me

Somebody care somebody care somebody care for me
Somebody care somebody care for me somebody care for me
And it's all i live for, the air i breathe
So it's all the same to me
Yeah, it's all the same to me

Eeny meeny miny moe
Ee-eye ee-eye ee-eyo oh
Where you where you where you go?
Well it's all the same to me

Eeny meeny miny moe
I won't holler, let me go
Don't you don't you don't you know
That it's all the same to me?

Somebody do somebody do somebody do you wrong
Don't let 'em kill don't let 'em kill don't let 'em kill your song

So i keep on shufflin' on and on

'cause it's all the same to me

I won't run when the sky turns to flame
And i sure won't budge when the earth does shake
When the flood comes up i will dance in the rain
'cause it's all the same to me

Eeny meeny miny moe
Ee-eye ee-eye ee-eyo oh
Where you where you where you go?
Well it's all the same to me

Eeny meeny miny moe
I won't holler, let me go
Don't you don't you don't you know
That it's all the same to me?

Somebody care somebody care somebody care for me
Somebody care somebody care for me somebody care for me
And it's all i live for, the air i breathe
So it's all the same to me
Yeah, it's all the same to me
Yeah, it's all the same to me
