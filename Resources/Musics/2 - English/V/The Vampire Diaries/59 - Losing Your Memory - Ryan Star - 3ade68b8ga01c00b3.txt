LOSING YOUR MEMORY - RYAN STAR

You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now.

Call all your friends,
And tell them you'll never call them back,
‘Cause this is the end,
Pretend that you own it don't react,
The damage is done,
the police are coming too slow now.

And I would have died,
I would have loved you all my life,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now.

Where have you gone?
The beach is so cold in winter here,
And where have I gone?
I wake in Montague with you near,
Remember the day,
‘Cause this is what dreams should always be,
I just want to stay,
I just want to keep this dream in me.

You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now,
You're losing your memory now.

Wake up it's time little girl wake up,
All the bad stuff that we've done has yet to have come,
Wake up it's time little girl wake up,
Just remember who I am in the morning.

You're losing your memory now (x8)
