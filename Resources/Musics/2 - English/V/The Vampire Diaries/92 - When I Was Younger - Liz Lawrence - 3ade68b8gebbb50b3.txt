WHEN I WAS YOUNGER - LIZ LAWRENCE

When I was younger
I told my mother
"I say, one day I'm gonna make you proud"

Now that I'm older
It's so much harder
To say those words out loud

You're growing taller
A little smarter
And one day you're gonna leave home
Oh, will you look like your mother's father
Oh, when you are fully grown?

Ooh ooh oh oh oh oho ho

When I was younger, I asked my father
"Why are we so human? "
Now that I'm older
I think I figured it out
We're just doing what we can

Oh ooh oh oh

Because I won't
I won't lay you down
I won't lay you
I won't lay you down, oh now
I won't, I won't lay down
I won't lay you, I won't lay you, I won't, I won't lay you down

When I was younger, I told my mother
"I say, one day I'm gonna make you proud"
