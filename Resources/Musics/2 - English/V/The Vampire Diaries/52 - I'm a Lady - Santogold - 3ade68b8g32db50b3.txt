I'M A LADY - SANTOGOLD

Now, won't you run and tell your boyfriend?
Tell him, don't hold his breath for me
I've got some money I was saving
Got some hearts that I'll be breaking
Know someday they'll make a martyr out of me
I know someday they'll make a martyr out of me

She's so fine

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I know what's been mad, you really don't
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I like to watch the way the wind blows
What does it know that I don't yet
Ooh, oh, look so pretty now
You're just so sweet
Let's see how far you can get
See just how far you can get

She's so fine

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I know what's been mad, you really don't
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

Dreams are gone and the dreams are gone
No one said, no, no one said
Make something with what's in your head
And the dreams are gone
And the dreams are gone

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I know what's been mad, you really don't
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I know what's been mad, you really don't
Try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Where everyone can see
I'm a lady
