BLOODSTREAM (VAMPIRE DIARIES REMIX) - STATELESS

Wake up
Look me in the eyes again
I need to feel your hand upon my face

Words can be like knives
They can cut you open
And then the silence surrounds you and haunts you

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you floating in me

Words can be like knives
They can cut you open
And then the silence surrounds you and haunts you

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you floating in me

The spaces in between
Two minds and all the places they have been
The spaces in between
I tried to put my finger on it
I tried to put my finger on it
I think I might've inhaled you

I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you floating in me

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you floating in me
