POISON & WINE - THE CIVIL WARS

You only know what I want I you to
I know everything you don't want me to
Your mouth is poison your mouth is wine
You think your dreams are the same as mine

I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I always will

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
(well) the less I give the more I get back
Your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice, but I'd still choose you

I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will

I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will

I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will
