I SHOULD GO - 	LEVI KREIS

Here we are
Isn't it familiar
haven't had someone to talk to
In a such long time
And it's strange
All we have in common
And your company was just the thing
I needed tonight
somehow I feel I should apologize
Cause I'm just a little shaken by
What's going on inside

I should go
Before my will gets any weaker
And my eyes begin to linger
Longer than they should
I should go
Before I lose my sense of reason
And this hour holds more meaning
Than it ever could
I should go
I should go
Baby, I should go

It's so hard
Keeping my composure
And pretend I don't see how your body
Curves beneath your clothes
And your laugh
Is pure and unaffected
It frightens me to know so well
The place I shouldn't go
But I know I gotta take the noble path
Cause I don't want you to question
The intentions that I have
I should go

Before my will gets any weaker
And my eyes begin to linger
Longer than they should
I should go
Before I lose my sense of reason
And this hour holds more meaning
Than it ever could
I should go
I should go
Baby, I should go

I don't mean to leave you
With a trivial excuse
And when you call tomorrow
I'll know what to do
But I should go

Before my will gets any weaker
And my eyes begin to linger
Longer than they should
I should go
Before I lose my sense of reason
And this hour holds more meaning
Than it ever could
I should go
I should go
Baby, I should go

I should go
Baby, I should go
I should go
