LET HER GO - PASSENGER

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it's starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you've let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
'Cuz dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely, it dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun, when it's starts to snow
Only know you love her when you've let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you've let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same ol' empty feeling in your heart
'Cuz love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But to never to touch and never to keep
'Cuz you loved her to much
And you dive too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun, when it's starts to snow
Only know you love her when you've let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you've let her go
And you let her go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, you let her go

'Cuz you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun, when it's starts to snow
Only know you love her when you've let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you've let her go

'Cuz you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun, when it's starts to snow
Only know you love her when you've let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you've let her go
And you let her go
