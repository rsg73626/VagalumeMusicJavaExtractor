WALKING BLIND - AIDAN HAWKEN AND CARINA ROUND

Don't tell me the truth
Tell me that it didn't happen
There's been a mistake
There's been a misunderstanding

Dirty your hands
Tearing my heart into pieces
If this is the end
Then we whisper the wind and release it

(chorus)
We don't have to know
We don't have it all worked out
Weï»¿ can just keep Walking blind

Don't give me your word
Give me something to hold on to
I don't want to fight
I don't want no big decision
I'm not afraid
for tearing your heart into pieces
