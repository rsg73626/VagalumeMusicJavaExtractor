ALWAYS TAKE YOU BACK - NIGHT TERRORS OF 1927

Your warpaint's running, the engine's humming
Steam from exhaust, I see sidewalk
Winter was bitter, locked up together
In the eye of the storm, it kept us warm

I'll always, always take you back (always, always take you back)
I'll always, always take you back (always, always take you back)
Feeling home in crisis, home at war
If it doesn't hurt, then what's a love for
At home in anguish, home in need
If it doesn't cut, then how am I gonna bleed

I'll always, always take you back (always, always take you back)
I'll always, always take you back (always, always take you back)
Even when I lose sight, even under cold light
I'll always, always take you back

Pace the room and shake your head
The weight of it all sinking in
Your hands, they shake, we raise the stakes
That's all it takes, over and over
Your tears, they take my strength away
The fear, the hate, the pain, the rage
All I have, you took away
I always cave, over and over

I'll always, always take you back (always, always take you back)
I'll always, always take you back (always, always take you back)
Even when I lose sight, even under cold light
I'll always, always take you back
Even when I can't fight, even when it's all eyes
I'll always take you back

We got so lost, so lost in the dark
Stuck there so long, felt like forever
The cold winter nights, storming outside
Wouldn't go back, but never say never
We got so lost, so lost in the dark
Stuck there so long, felt like forever
The cold winter nights, storming outside
Wouldn't go back, but never say never

Never say never (always, always)
(Always, always)
