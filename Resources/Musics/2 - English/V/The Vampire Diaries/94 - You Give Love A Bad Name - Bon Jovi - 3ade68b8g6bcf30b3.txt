YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME - BON JOVI

Shot through the heart
And your to blame
Darling you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sel
You promise me heaven
Then put me through hell
Chains of love
Got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free
You're a loaded gun... yeah
There's nowhere to run
No-one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart
And your to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

You paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boys dream
You act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
You're a loaded gun
There's nowhere to run
No-one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart
And your to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love

Shot through the heart and your to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart and your to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad nameyou give love
You give love a bad nameyou give love
You give love a bad nameyou give love
