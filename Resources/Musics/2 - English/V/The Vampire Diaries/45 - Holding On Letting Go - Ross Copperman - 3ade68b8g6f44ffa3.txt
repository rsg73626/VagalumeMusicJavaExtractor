HOLDING ON LETTING GO - ROSS COPPERMAN

Is anybody out there?
Is anybody listening?
Does anybody really know?
Is the end of the beginning
The cry a rush a one breath
Is all we waiting for
Sometimes I want my taking
Changes everyone before

(Chorus)
It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go

Sometimes we're holding angels
And we never even know
Don't know if we'll make it, or we know
We just can't let it show

(Chorus)
It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
Yeah, letting go

It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go

(Chorus)
It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go.
