I DON'T DESERVE YOU - PLUMB

You're the first face that I see
And the last thing I think about
You're the reason that I'm alive
You're what I can't live without
You're what I can't live without

You never give up
When I'm falling apart
You're arms are always open wide
And you're quick to forgive when I make a mistake
You love me in the blink of an eye

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
I can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running
And come right after me
It's what you do
And I don't deserve you

You're the light inside my eyes
You give me reason to keep trying
You give me more than I could dream
And you bring me to my knees
You bring me to my knees

Your heart is golden
How am I the one
That you've chosen to love
I still can't believe
That you're right next to me
After all that I've done

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
I can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running
And come right after me
It's what you do
And I don't deserve you

I don't deserve
A chance like this
I don't deserve
A love that gives me everything
You're everything I want

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
I can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running
And come right after me
It's what you do
And I don't deserve you
And I don't deserve you
