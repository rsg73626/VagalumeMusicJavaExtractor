MAKE IT WITHOUT YOU - ANDREW BELLE

This is the starting of my greatest fear
I'm all packed up, getting out of here
But then you call and tell me not to go
That I'm the one who put the rock n roll
In your life
This is the starting of a brand new day
I never liked this town much anyway
I need this city like I need the rain
I know that somewhere there's a north bound train
Oh-oo-oh I'll make it without you
And though my bodies laying here
It's my mouth that must be lying now
This is the starting of my fall from grace
My self esteem, it's seen better days
But you know I'll never let this go to waste
I'll keep this memory on the map I trace
Back to home
My friends go out, but I've been staying in
I know I should but that's the way it's been
I never cared much for the taste of gin
I still don't now, oh, but it's been helpin
Oh-oo-oh I'll make it without you
In my life
Oh-oo-oh I'll make it without you
And though my bodies laying here
It's my mouth that must be lying now
