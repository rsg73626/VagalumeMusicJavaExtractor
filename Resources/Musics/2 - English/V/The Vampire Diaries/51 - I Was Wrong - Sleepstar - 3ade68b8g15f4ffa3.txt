I WAS WRONG - SLEEPSTAR

I saw you fell asleep
While you were reading
Pages on your face
You had been weeping

And I saw
What it was
That I had done

But last night
We fell apart
And broke to pieces

Our love was in the hall
All packed in boxes

And I saw
What it was
That I had done
To you

I was wrong
I was wrong

Yeah...

I was wrong
I was wrong

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
