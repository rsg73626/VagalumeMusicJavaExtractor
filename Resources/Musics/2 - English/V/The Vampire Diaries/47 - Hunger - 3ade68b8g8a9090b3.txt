HUNGER

One look and I can't catch my breath
Two souls into one flesh
When you're not next to me
I'm incomplete

'Cause I am on fire
Like a thousand suns
I couldn't burn it out
Even if I wanted to

These flames tonight
Look into my eyes and say
You want me too like I want you

Oh, love, let me see inside your heart
All the cracks and broken hearts
There's shadows in the light
There's no need to hide

'Cause I am on fire
Like a thousand suns
I couldn't burn it out
Even if I wanted to

These flames tonight
Look into my eyes and say
You want me too like I want you

It's like a hunger in me and it's never ending
And I'll burn for you (I'll burn for you)
It's like a hunger in me and it's never ending
And I'll burn for you (I'll burn for you)

I'm on fire
Like a thousand suns
I couldn't burn it out
Even if I wanted to

These flames tonight
Look into my eyes and say
You want me to like I want you
I got a hunger in me
I got a hunger in me
