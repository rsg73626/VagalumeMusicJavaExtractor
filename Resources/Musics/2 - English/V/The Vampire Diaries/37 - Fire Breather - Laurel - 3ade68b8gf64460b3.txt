FIRE BREATHER - LAUREL

Town crier, village flyer
Got a skull and crossbones on his chest
And I can't resist
When he looks like this
All his other girls
Face on magazines
Big blue eyes, oh I don't know what it means, no
What does he want from me?

We're hanging in the bars
Running after cars to get home
Wishing on the stars, wonder what you are
I just don't know, he's beautiful
Maybe he shines a little more than me
No, it's too much, burn my sun
Up in flames we go you fire breather
Ash and dust on my door, smoke rise
Trying to survive inside your heart

Fire breather, breath in fire into
Fire breather, trying to survive inside your heart
Flame thrower, at the show
Make my heart melt in the middle of the room
No, I can't stay away
Now I'm begging you to stay

Sitting through the days
And wasting away to the weekends
Running on the green through the sticks of the suburbs
I learned maybe you shine a little more than me
No, it's too much, burn my sun
Up in flames we go you fire breather
Ash and dust on my door, smoke rise
Trying to survive inside your heart

Fire breather, breath in fire into
Fire breather, breath in fire into
No, it's too much, burn my sun
Up in flames we go you fire breather
Ash and dust on my door, smoke rise
Trying to survive inside your heart
