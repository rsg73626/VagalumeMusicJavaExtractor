THE HARDEST PART - NINA NESBITT

Pretend you're happy, pretend we're fine
I guess that's easier after all this time
Talk about someone else then look in my eyes
I know you still hold on to us inside
But we watched that butterfly fly

I'd give anything just to be with you again
But it's not the right time
And I'd give everything just to feel you on my skin
But it's not the right time
It'll never be right time, will it?
It might never be the right time
And that's the hardest part of it

I keep you in my mind even though you've gone
Holding on to nothing is easier than letting go
Stuck in the memories of what has been
Just please don't love another like you loved me
Time doesn't heal it just leaves me asking why

I'd give anything just to be with you again
But it's not the right time
And I'd give everything just to feel you on my skin
But it's not the right time
It'll never be right time, will it?
It might never be the right time
And that's the hardest part of it

I don't know why I feel this way
If I could I'd change
Believe me
And I know that you feel the same
Is it too late for saving?
Oh here I go again

Cause I'd give anything just to be with you again
But it's not the right time
I'd give everything just to feel you on my skin
But it's not the right time
It'll never be right time, will it?
It might never be the right time
And that's the hardest part of it
It'll never be the right time, will it?
