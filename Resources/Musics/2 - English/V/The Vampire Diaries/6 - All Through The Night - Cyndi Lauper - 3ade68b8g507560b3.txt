ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT - CYNDI LAUPER

All through the night
I'll be awake
And I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time
When time is new

Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
The same without saying

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten
What binding they lack

Oh, under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
A chance they may see

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
Keep with me forward all through the night
