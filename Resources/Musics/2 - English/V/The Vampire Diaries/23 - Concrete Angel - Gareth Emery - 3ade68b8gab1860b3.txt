CONCRETE ANGEL - GARETH EMERY

Let me breath you in, and breath the words in your mouth
Inside your shivering, the silence shouts so loud
I just want to, I just want to stay around
And while my heart beats I promise I won't let you down

If you keep building these walls, brick by brick
Towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, until the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are, soon
There will be nothing at all, until the concrete angel falls

If I'm somewhere else it doesn't mean that I don't see
That you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me
It makes me crazy, when you're
Crazy, you don't speak, you think you know me
But what you know is just skin deep

If you keep building these walls, brick by brick
Towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, until the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are, soon
There will be nothing at all, until the concrete angel falls

It's twisting your mind
I'm not getting through, cos I don't see it like you do
There's nothing to find you've got no excuse
I'm over getting over you
Cos I don't see it like you do
I'm over getting over you

If you keep building these walls, brick by brick
Towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, until the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are, soon
There will be nothing at all, until the concrete angel falls
