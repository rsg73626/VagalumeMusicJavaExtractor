BREATHE AGAIN - SARA BAREILLES

'Car is parked, bags are packed
But what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch
The one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone
And now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide
If the fire inside still burns

All I have, all I need, he's the air
I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
Still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping
Someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again

Open up next to you and
My secrets become your truth
And the distance between that
Was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built
From all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love
I can't carry anymore

All I have, all I need, he's
The air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
Still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping
Someday I'll breathe again

It hurts to be here
I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I gonna do?

All I have, all I need, he's
The air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
Still I'm searching
All I have, all I need, he's
The air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
Still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping
Someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again... '
