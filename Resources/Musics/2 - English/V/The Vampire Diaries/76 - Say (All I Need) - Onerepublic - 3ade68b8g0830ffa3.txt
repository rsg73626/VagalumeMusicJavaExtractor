SAY (ALL I NEED) - ONEREPUBLIC

Do you know where your heart is?
Do you think you can find it?
Did you trade it for something, somewhere?
Better just to have it 
Do you know where your love is?
Do you think that you lost it?
You felt it so strong 
but nothing's
Turned out how you want it

Well bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
Cause you wont let go
Of anything you hold

Well all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Do you know what your fate is?
And are you trying to shake it
You're doing your best and
You're best look
You're praying that you'll make it
Well bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
Cause you wont let go
Of anything you hold

Well all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Said all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Better than you have it
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Better than you have it
Better than you have it

Said all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

Said all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

Do you know where the end is?
Do you think you can see it?

Until you get there
Go on
Go ahead and scream it
Just say...
