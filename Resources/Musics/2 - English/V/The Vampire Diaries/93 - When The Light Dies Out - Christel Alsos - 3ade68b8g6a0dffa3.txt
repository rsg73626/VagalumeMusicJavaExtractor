WHEN THE LIGHT DIES OUT - CHRISTEL ALSOS

It felt so wrong
Dying in your arms
Just to keep you
Could we belong
In one another's arms
And see this through
Is this not worth
This heart that bleeds
On my sleeve
Oh how I miss you
When the light dies out
Will we see nothing
As we slip away
From each other
Is it just for now
This sinking feeling of
Losing what we have
Is this not worth
This heart that bleeds
On my sleeve
Oh how I miss you
