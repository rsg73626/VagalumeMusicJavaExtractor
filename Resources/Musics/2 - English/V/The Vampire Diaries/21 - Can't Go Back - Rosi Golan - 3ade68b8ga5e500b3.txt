CAN'T GO BACK - ROSI GOLAN

Some things you can't go back to, some things need left alone
Don't mess with a memories of a life passed on
Oh the tumbling reservations at the heart of my mistakes
Oh some things you can't go back to cause you let them slip away

I don't wanna be a witness to a path that's overgrown
I don't wanna see this house not be a home
'Cause time has taken toll on what we couldn't see
No I don't wanna be a witness to the end of you and me

How am I gonna make each moment better than the last
How am I gonna make it better if I can't go back

Oh the tumbling reservations at the heart of my mistakes
Oh some things you can't go back to cause you let them slip away
Oh some things you can't go back to
