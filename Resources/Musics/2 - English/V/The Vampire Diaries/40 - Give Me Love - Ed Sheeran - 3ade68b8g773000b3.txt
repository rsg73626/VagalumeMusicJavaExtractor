GIVE ME LOVE - ED SHEERAN

Give me love like her,
'cause lately I've been waking up alone.
Paint spotted tear drops on my shirt,
Told you I'd let them go.

And I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya,

Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,

My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my give me love.

Give me love like never before,
'cause lately I've been craving more.
And it's been a while but I still feel the same,
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood, is drowning in alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya,

Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,

My my, my my, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

My my, my my, oh give me love
My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my oh give me love,
My my, my my give me love.

Oh My my, Oh my my, oh give me love
