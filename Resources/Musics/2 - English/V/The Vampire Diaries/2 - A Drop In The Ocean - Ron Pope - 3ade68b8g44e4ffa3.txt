A DROP IN THE OCEAN - RON POPE

A drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying
That you and me
Might end up together
It's like wishing for rain
As i stand in the desert
But i'm holding you
Closer than most
'cause you are my heaven

I don't wanna
Waste the weekend
If you don't love me
Pretend
A few more hours
Then it's time to go
As my train rolls down
The east coast
I wonder how
You'll keep warm
It's too late to cry
Too broken to move on

Still i can't let you be
Most nights i hardly sleep
Don't take
What you don't need from me

A drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying
That you and me
Might end up together
It's like wishing for rain
As i stand in the desert
But i'm holding you
Closer than most
'cause you are my heaven

Misplaced trust
And old friends
Never counting regrets
By the grace of god
I do not rest at all
New england
As the leaves change
The last excuse
That i'll claim
I was a boy
Who loved a woman
Like a little girl

Still i can't let you be
Most nights i hardly sleep
Don't take what you
Don't need from me

A drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying
That you and me
Might end up together
It's like wishing for rain
As i stand in the desert
But i'm holding you
Closer than most
'cause you are my

Heaven doesn't seem
Far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away
Heaven doesn't seem
Far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away

A drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying
That you and me
Might end up together
It's like wishing for rain
As i stand in the desert
But i'm holding you
Closer than most
'cause you are my heaven
You are my heaven
