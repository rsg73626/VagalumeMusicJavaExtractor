SORRY - CLOONEY

You can blame all on me
You can say it was and meant to be
You can claim I was impossible to all your friends
I won't defend myself
I knew the ending from the start
I knew the twisted working of my heart
I knew I wanted you
But happiness was never mine
to keep for long
Cause it belonged to someone else

Sorry that I love you
Sorry for what I do
For everything I'll never be and all that I am
Sorry for the silence, sorry for the violence
Here comes the words that broken
My hearts can never stand
It's not you it's me it's not you it's me

I know there's work I gotta do
I know the sky above is better blue
I know the million fact that registered
That never make the cloud just disappear
But I'm in the dark yeah

Sorry that I love you
Sorry for what I do
For everything I'll never be and all that I am
Sorry for the silence, sorry for the violence
Here comes the words that broken
My hearts can never stand
It's not you it's me it's not you it's me
It's not you it's me
It's not you it's me
It's me, it's me
It's me, it's me

Not you, not you
Sorry that I love you
Sorry for what I do
For everything I'll never be and all that I am
Sorry for the silence, sorry for the violence
Here comes the words that broken
My hearts can never stand

Sorry that I love you
Sorry for what I do
For everything I'll never be and all that I am
Sorry for the silence, sorry for the violence
Here comes the words that broken
My hearts can never stand

It's not you it's me it's not you it's me
It's not you it's me, me

You can blame all on me
You can say it was and meant to be
You can claim I was impossible
to all your friends
I won't defend myself
