HERE WE GO - 	MAT KEARNEY

Did you close your eyes as you walked away?
Did I get too close in the pouring rain?
If there's one more chance for us here tonight
I'll take the long way 'round this time

We sing
Oh, love, it's easy if you don't try to please me
If you don't wanna see me any more
We sing out...

Oh, oh
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh, oh
Oh, Oh

Bitter is the kiss that says goodbye
I can hear it in your voice, I see it in your eyes
'Cause we've been this low and we've been around this bend
I don't wanna lose you all over again

We sing
Oh, love, it's easy if you don't try to please me
If you don't wanna see me any more
We sing out...

Oh, oh
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round an 'round again
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, no
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

'Round here, hey hey
We've got a light here that's not going away
If all is broken and all is lost
Then I've been found, so here's my heart
I'll give over and over again

Here we go again, here we go again
Here we go again, here we go again

Oh, oh
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh no
Oh no

[3x]
It's a long road, baby
Running away
It's a long road, baby
Running away

It's a long road, baby
Running away
