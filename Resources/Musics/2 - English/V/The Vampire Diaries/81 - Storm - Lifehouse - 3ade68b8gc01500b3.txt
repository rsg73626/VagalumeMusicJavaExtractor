STORM - LIFEHOUSE

How long have I been in this storm?
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Water's getting harder to tread
With these waves crashing over my head

If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I had see you
This storm would turn to light

And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
And know everything will be all right
And know everything is all right

I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
So why am I ten feet under and upside down
Barely surviving has become my purpose
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface

If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I had see you
This storm would turn to light

And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
And know everything will be all right
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost inyo your eyes
And know everything would all right
And know everything is all right
Everything is all right
(Yeah)
Everything is all right
(Yeah)
