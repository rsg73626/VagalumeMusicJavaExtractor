OCEAN WIDE - THE AFTERS

Look outside
It's already light and the stars ran away with the night
Things were said, words that we'll try forget,
It's so hard to admit I know we've made mistakes
I see through all the tears but that's what got us here

If love is an ocean wide
We'll swim in the tears we cry
They'll see us through to the other side
We're gonna make it
When love is raging sea
You can hold on to me
We'll find a way tonight
Love is an ocean wide

I'll stay right here
It's where I'll always belong
Tied with your arms
Days like this, I wish the sun wouldn't set
I don't want to forget
What made us feel this way
You see through all my fears
All that's what got us here

Love is an ocean wide enough to forget
Even when we think we can't.
