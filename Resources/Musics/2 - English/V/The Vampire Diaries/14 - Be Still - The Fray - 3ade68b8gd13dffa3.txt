BE STILL - THE FRAY

Be still and know that I'm with you
Be still and know that I'm here
Be still and know that I'm with you
Be still, be still, and know

When darkness comes upon you
And covers you with fear and shame
Be still and know that I'm with you
And I will say your name

If fear falls upon your bed and sleep no longer comes
Remember all the words I said
Be still, be still and know

And if you go through the valley
And the shadow comes down from the hill
If morning never comes to be
Be still, be still, be still

And if you forget the way to go
And lose where you came from
Just know I'm standing beside you
Be still, and know I am

Be still and know that I'm with you
Be still and know I am
