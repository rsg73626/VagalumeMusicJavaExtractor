BE THE SONG - FOY VANCE

When nightmares come,
Keep you awake,
Baby close your eyes,
I'll take the weight,
If I go to speak,
I will refrain and be the song,
Just be the song.

When inner scars,
Show on your face,
And darkness hides,
Your sense of place,
Well I won't speak,
I will refrain and be the song,
Just be the song.

Flow down all my mountains,
Darlin' fill my valleys,
Flow down all my mountains,
Darlin' fill my valleys,
Flow down all my mountains,
Darlin' fill my valleys,

And when you run
Far from my eyes,
Then I will come,
In dead of night,
But I won't speak,
Till mornin' light,
I'll be the song,
Just be the song.

Flow down all my mountains,
Darlin' fill my valleys,
Flow down all my mountains,
Darlin' fill my valleys,
Flow down all my mountains,
Darlin' fill my valleys
