BETWEEN - COURRIER

Can we ever get rid of the whats and the ifs
That doubts that exist in our minds
In the silence I am tricked into thinking you'll forget
And I'll be stranded like a man in a mine

The day between the soil and the sky
An emptiness, a void, a heaviness, a sigh,
But I know you will make through alive
Cause you never said goodbye

Like a city besieged, it was the loneliest thing
Your silence held in cold delay
And I felt faint of heart cause I was caught between
The weight of everything I couldn't say

The day between the soil and the sky
An emptiness, a void, a heaviness, a sigh,
But I know you will make through alive
Cause you never said goodbye

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How to follow, to follow, to follow,
Cause you and I know I can't go, I can't go
Between the gallows and the gates

The day between the soil and the sky
An emptiness, a void, a heaviness, a sigh,
But I know you will make through alive
Cause you never said goodbye
