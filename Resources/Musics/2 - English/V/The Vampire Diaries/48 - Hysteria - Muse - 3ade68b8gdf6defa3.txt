HYSTERIA - MUSE

It's bugging me
Grating me
And twisting me around

Yeah I'm endlessly
Caving in
And turning inside out

'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

Yeah It's holding me
Morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly
Cool within
And dreaming I'm alive.

'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now
I want you now
I feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode
