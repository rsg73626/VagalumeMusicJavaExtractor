FROM THE WRECKAGE BUILD A HOME - THE WIND AND THE WAVE

We were racing down a road littered with crosses
Right down to jalama beach
And even though we missed the sunset
We jumped over barbed wire and cacti
Just to fall into the sea
Skinny dipping' youngin's, you and I

We're built to last
We're built to last
Oh, we're built to last
We're built to last

Well now it's clear you're the wind and I'm the wave
Oh together we can brave all the things we never knew
So I'm making room on a boat I built for one
We can sail into the sun
Till our skin's as tough as diamonds

We're built to last
We're built to last
Oh, we're built to last
We're built to last
Oh we're built to last
We're built to last

If our ship does sink we will follow it like stones
From the wreckage build a home
From the wreckage build a home
We're built to last
We're built to last
Oh, we're built to last
We're built to last
Oh we're built to last
We're built to last
