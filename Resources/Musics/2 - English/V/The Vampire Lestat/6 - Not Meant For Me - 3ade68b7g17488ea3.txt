NOT MEANT FOR ME

You think you're smart
You're not, it's plain to see
That you want me to fall off
It's killing me, let's see
You've got the gall
Come take it all

The jury is coming
Coming to tear me apart
All this bitching and moaning
Come on it's on

I'm trapped in this world
Lonely and fading
Heartbroke and waiting
For you to come
We are stuck in this world
That's not meant for me
For me

So what you got
One more try
It seems to me
That you're not needed
Come on
It's killing me, let's see
You got the gall
Come take it all

The jury is coming
Coming to tear me apart
All this bitching and moaning
Come on it's on

I'm trapped in this world
Lonely and fading
Heartbroke and waiting
For you to come
We are stuck in this world
That's not meant for me
For me

(Break)

I'm trapped in this world
Lonely and fading
Heartbroke and waiting
For you to come
We are stuck in this world
That's not meant for me
For me
I'm trapped in this world
Lonely and fading
Heartbroke and waiting
For you to come
we are stuck in this world
That's not meant for me
For me
For me
