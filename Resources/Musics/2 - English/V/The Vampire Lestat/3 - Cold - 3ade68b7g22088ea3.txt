COLD

We kiss
The Stars
We writhe
We are

Your name
Desire
Your flesh
We are

Cold
We're so cold
We are so
Cold
We're so cold
(x2)

Your mouth
This words
Silence
It turns
Humming
We laugh
My head
Falls back

Cold
We're so cold
We are so
Cold
We're so cold
(x2)

(Break)

Cold
We're so cold
We are so
Cold
We're so cold
(x2)
