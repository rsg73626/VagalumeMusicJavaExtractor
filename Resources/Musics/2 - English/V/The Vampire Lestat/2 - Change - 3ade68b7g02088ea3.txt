CHANGE

I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away you were on fire
I watched a change in you
Itâ€™s like you never had wings
now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
then i laughed
I watched a change in you
like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
Like you never had wings
(harmonizing)
I look at the cross
Then I look away
I give you the gun
Blow me away
