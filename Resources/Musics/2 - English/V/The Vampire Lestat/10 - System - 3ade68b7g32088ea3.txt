System...

System...

You fell away
What more can I say
The feeling's evolved
I won't let it out

I can't replace
Your screaming face
Feeling the sickness inside...

Refrão
Why won't you die
Your blood in mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine

So many words
Can't describe my face
This feeling's evolved
So soon to break out

I can't relate
To a happy state
Feeling the blood run inside...

Refrão

Why is everything so fucking hard for me
Keep me down to what you think,
I should be
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry
Keep on trying, I'm not dying so easily
(I will not die)
Why is everything so fucking hard for me
(I will not die)
Why is everything so fucking hard for me
(I will not die)

Refrão x2
