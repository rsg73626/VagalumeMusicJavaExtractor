BEFORE I'M DEAD

Moon hangs around
A blade over my head
Reminds me
What to do before I'm dead
Night consumes light
And all I dread
Reminds me what to do before I'm dead

Sun reclines, eats my mind
Reminds me what to leave behind
Light eats night and all i never said
Reminds me what to do before i'm

To see you
To touch you
To see you
To touch you

Epochs fly, reminds me
What i hide, reminds me
Desert skies cracks the spies
Reminds me what i never tried
The ocean wide salted red
Reminds me what to do before i'm

To see you
To touch you
To feel you
To tell you

The sun reclines.....remind me
The desert skies....remind me
The ocean wide salted red
Reminds me what to do before i'm

(in echo)
To see you
To touch you
To feel you
To tell you
