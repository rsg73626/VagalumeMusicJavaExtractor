NOTHING REALLY MATTERS

I keep my head on the ground
There are people all around
In my brain I hold my head high
We are strangers in the night

I don't really know
But I wish that I could feel
No hands on my wrist

Nothing really matters
Cause I know that there is
More than what you say
Nothing really matters
Cause I hold myself
To pay for what you get

We are chasing all around
We are built on solid ground
Keep your eyes on what you feel
There's something when I'm near
So we sit on holy ground

Wish that I could feel your
Spirit like a ghost
Only I know
Doesn't matter anymore
It doesn't matter anymore

Nothing really matters
Cause I know that there is
More than what you say
Nothing really matters
Cause I hold myself
To pay for what you get

Trying to make your
And your pieces

I know this is what you desire

What I want of you
Is to be right to you

Nothing really matters
Cause I know that there is
More than what you say
Nothing really matters
Cause I hold myself
To pay for what you need

Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

Nothing really matters
Cause I know that there is
More than what you say
Nothing really matters
Cause I hold myself
To pay for what you need

To me
To me
To me
