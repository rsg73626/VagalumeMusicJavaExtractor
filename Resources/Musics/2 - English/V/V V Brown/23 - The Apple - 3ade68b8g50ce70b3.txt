THE APPLE

Keep me down
Take my heart
Hold me captive
Tear me a part
Make me better
Consume my soul
Cross the water
To another world

In the middle of the night I see you go
We have grown apart into lonely souls

Don't testify me
Don't bring me down
Don't hold me captive
Not the apple of my eye
See, don't patronize me
I'm not your clown
Don't cause me suffering
It's over now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Hold my soul now
Inside your box
Make me loose
Psychological locks
Baby I'll find, something better
Maybe we could try and predict the weather

In the middle of the night I see you go
We have grown apart into lonely souls

Don't testify me
Don't bring me down
Don't hold me captive
Not the apple of my eye
See, don't patronize me
I'm not your clown
Don't cause me suffering
It's over now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Our love crashed before our lives
Like the ocean paralyze
Our love crashed before our lives
Don't bring me down

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Don't bring me down
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Don't bring me down
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Don't testify me
Don't bring me down
Don't hold me captive
Not the apple of my eye
See, don't patronize me
I'm not your clown
Don't cause me suffering
It's over now
