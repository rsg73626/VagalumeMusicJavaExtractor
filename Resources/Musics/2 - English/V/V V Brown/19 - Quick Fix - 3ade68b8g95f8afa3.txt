QUICK FIX

Hey honey, honey
I'm not looking for a quick fix
Hey baby, baby
Don't you know that i'm love sick
Hey darlin' darlin'
Think it through
Baby baby be quick

Need my inhaler cause i think i'm havin' asthma
attacks
Why won't you save me? save me with your kisses like
that
Hey darlin' darlin' won't you come take this pain
away?

Do you love me? (do you love me?)
Do you need me? (do you need me?)
You'd better get down on your knees and tell me that
you want me
Oh baby, say that you'll stay
Love me here forever

Hey sweetie sweetie
Do you think you can control this?
Hey papa papa
Thinks you're crazy and i won't admit
Hey sugar sugar
I can see that you're a victim in this

Do you love me? (do you love me?)
Do you need me? (do you need me?)
You'd better get down on your knees and tell me that
you want me
Oh baby, say that you'll stay
Love me here forever

I never knew i could find anybody like you
The way you walk, way you talk, way you glow in the
room(?)
You wear a and messy brown shoes
You like to make comic books and you love writin'
tunes
You're six foot two and a nerd and i love?
Oh why the fuss, hurry up and tell me you love me too

Do you love me? (do you love me?)
Do you need me? (do you need me?)
You'd better get down on your knees and tell me that
you want me
Oh baby, say that you'll stay
Love me here forever
