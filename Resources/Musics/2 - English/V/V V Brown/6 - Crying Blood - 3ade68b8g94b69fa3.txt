CRYING BLOOD

Can't belive what you've done to me,
you got me feeling like a cloud in a stormy weather,
obviously it is hard to see that the sun will never shine when we are together,
how can you be so ignorant to the fact that i'ma be in this pain forever,
when you touch me i go insane for a part like a wave of a baby feather,
you belive that your holding me,
can't you see ?

I'm crying blood,
I'm crying blood,
im crying tears from my eyes that i can't deny
and i am falling like a comet from the broken sky.

I'm crying blood,
I'm crying blood,
im crying tears from my eyes that i can't deny
and i am falling like a comet from the broken sky.

Don't you come with your medicine and be a doctor in the time of a needy child,
I got my clothes and a mess for you, that's my hair to the side and im going wild,
tell me that you have turned around, write a letter to my mother cos she getting better,
You can even do the crazy stuff because the shame is in the fact you have never met her!
Can't belive what you do to me,
Can't you see?

I'm crying blood,
I'm crying blood,
im crying tears from my eyes that i can't deny
and i am falling like a comet from the broken sky.

I'm crying blood,
I'm crying blood,
im crying tears from my eyes that i can't deny
and i am falling like a comet from the broken sky.

[Oh How You] Oh how you need me,
[Desperately] Desperately need me,
[Wish You Could] Wish you could love me,
[Uncut Just To] Uncut just to need me.

I'm crying blood,
[cry cry cry] I'm crying blood,
im crying tears from my eyes that i can't deny
and i am falling like a comet from the broken sky.

I'm crying blood,
I'm crying blood,
im crying tears from my eyes that i can't deny
and i am falling like a comet from the broken sky.
