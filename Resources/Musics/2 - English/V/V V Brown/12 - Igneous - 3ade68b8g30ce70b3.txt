IGNEOUS

We rule the world, and chase down our enemies
We run like fire, come run now ahead of me

What do I do to myself?
What is the card that I've dealt?
Come with me now and relax
And let it go to relax
What do I do to myself?
What is the card that I've dealt?
Come with me now and relax
And let it go to relax

I am a mountain I'm standing right there
Solid and powerful I'll never be scared
Never be broken, so start believing
It's all in the moment
I am a mountain you're gonna be there
I know you're waiting, so don't you be scared
Igneous please, I pull down defeat
It's all in the moment

We are incredible, like wolves in the wilderness
We are unstoppable, like tribes in the jungle

What do I do to myself?
What is the card that I've dealt?
Come with me now and relax
And let it go to relax
What do I do to myself?
What is the card that I've dealt?
Come with me now and relax
And let it go to relax

I am a mountain I'm standing right there
Solid and powerful I'll never be scared
Never be broken, so start believing
It's all in the moment
I am a mountain you're gonna be there
I know you're waiting, so don't you be scared
Igneous please, I pull down defeat
It's all in the moment

I am a mountain I'm standing right there
Solid and powerful I'll never be scared
Never be broken, so start believing
It's all in the moment
I am a mountain you're gonna be there
I know you're waiting, so don't you be scared
Igneous please, I pull down defeat
It's all in the moment

Never mind the cracked creed
A little more like high speed
Feeling like those faqs meet
A little bit of rhythm like a mother breathes life
And I'm sharp like a knife, hard to decide this
We are living like the last days
And people shout it out 'cause they remember our names
We are forever like the mountain of the old days
Stronger than tough
Oh yeah
Stronger than tough

It's all in the moment

I am a mountain I'm standing right there
Solid and powerful I'll never be scared
Never be broken, so start believing
It's all in the moment
I am a mountain you're gonna be there
I know you're waiting, so don't you be scared
Igneous please, I pull down defeat
It's all in the moment
