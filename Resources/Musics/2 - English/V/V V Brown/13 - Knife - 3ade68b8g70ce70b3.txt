KNIFE

I wanna say everything
Everything that I've got, that I've got
I haven't got a thing to lose
No nothing no, not at all, not at all

We gave everything that we had
Eleven years and seven months
You chose to throw it all away
To something that you didn't love, couldn't hurt

So closer tender unto
It's welcome forever shortened
One million pieces over
It's over, it's over

I don't really feel like laughing
It's not a joke not anymore
I don't really feel like crying
There's no tears here anymore
I don't really feel like trusting
It's not worth it anymore
Like a knife overloving you
And you're hurting me more and more

Took your time to arrive
I don't know the full story
Pulled me down, give me life
Everytime you could see there was more in her beautiful
Maybe I'll get it right, get it right next time

I can feel us slowly dying
There's no water anymore
I can feel like we are drowning
You don't love me anymore
Can't you feel us slowly drowning?
I can't take this anymore
Like a knife overloving you
And you're killing me more and more

I don't really feel like laughing
It's not a joke not anymore
I don't really feel like crying
There's no tears here anymore
I don't really feel like trusting
It's not worth it anymore
Like a knife overloving you
And you're hurting me more and more
