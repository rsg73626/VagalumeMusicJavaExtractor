LAZARUS

Rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up

Blue, red, lightness, colorful
How much currency is a bitch, girls playing
Sunrise, glasses black, die young
Whine, beer, drunk full, real blood, white bull

Candies, candies
Bite break, hold it out, so I go warp
Time, time, push it, push it
Hanging on a penny here
It's so weird and I'm wonderful Alice

Who live without all the noise wanna blow it all out
don't wanna hear the static energy
All I wanna do is fly next to you
And fly amongst the glass

So rise up, rise it all up
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise it all up?
What's that shit all about?
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise it all up
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise?

Hands out, baby, I'm gon' rise above, above
Come now, tell me, you've been gone for far too long

Down drugs, smacked pies, Iphones, lost bars
Poor and rich, play three, clean dust, playing bee
Black, white, girl white, so white privilege
Equal mix of american evil bitch
Up, down, in balance, kept it to an artist
See, the society, digital narcissism
Dead, live, ask espace, left to the pressure your phrase
Rise up, feed base, live at the lepfire phase

Who live without all the noise wanna blow it all out
don't wanna hear the static energy
All I wanna do is fly next to you
And fly amongst the glass

So rise up, rise it all up
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise it all up?
What's that shit all about?
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise it all up
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise?

Hands out, baby, I'm gon' rise above, above
Come now, tell me, you've been gone for far too long

Lazarus, rise, rise
Lazarus, rise, rise

Who live without all the noise wanna blow it all out
don't wanna hear the static energy
All I wanna do is fly next to you
And fly amongst the glass

So rise up, rise it all up (rise, rise)
Won't you rise it all up? Won't you rise it all up? (rise, rise)
What's that shit all about?
Won't you rise it all up? (rise, rise) Won't you rise it all up
Won't you rise it all up? (rise, rise) Won't you rise?

Hands out, baby, I'm gon' rise above, above
Come now, tell me, you've been gone for far too long

Rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up
