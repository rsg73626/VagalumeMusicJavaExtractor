FAITH (FEAT. KELE OKEREKE)

I shake it off as I fall down to the ground
Belly-flop into a swimming pool of sound
'Cause when we're gone there'll be no-one else around
So you got to have faith (oh yeah)

I shake it off as I fall down to the ground
Belly-flop into a swimming pool of sound
'Cause when we're gone there'll be no-one else around
So you got to have faith (oh yeah)
Or we're gonna fade away (oh yeah)

I don't really care what's going on
Forget about the righting all the wrongs
Do whatever you feel, do what you like
We're underwater, free and sanctified

I shake it off as I fall down to the ground
Belly-flop into a swimming pool of sound
'Cause when we're gone there'll be no-one else around
So you got to have faith (oh yeah)
Or we're gonna fade away (oh yeah)

You got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (oh yeah)
So, you got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (oh yeah)

I shake it off as I fall down to the ground
Belly-flop into a swimming pool of sound
'Cause when we're gone there'll be no-one else around
So you got to have faith (oh yeah)
Or we're gonna fade away (oh yeah)

You got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (oh yeah)
So, you got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (Got to have faith)
You got to have faith (oh yeah)
