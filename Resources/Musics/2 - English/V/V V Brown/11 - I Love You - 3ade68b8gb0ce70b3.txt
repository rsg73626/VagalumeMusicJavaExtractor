I LOVE YOU

Oh oh oh ooh oh oh ooh mm

Riding down the boulevard
On our bikes, we pedal hard
Touch my waist, pull me along
You kept me safe, you kept me strong
Wishing we could stay right here
And time would slow down forever

I love you you you you you, you you you
And every little thing that you do for me (I love you)
I love you you you you you, you you you
And every little thing that you do for me (I love you)

The restaurant down by the sea
Thats where we'd go
Just you and me
Every time, number 29
We would eat on those plastic seats
Wishing we could stay right here
And time would just go on forever

I love you you you you you, you you you
And every little thing that you do for me (I love you)
I love you you you you you, you you you
And every little thing that you do for me (I love you)

I love you... oohh (for everything you are, I...)
I love you... for every little thing you are

I love you you you you you, you you you
And every little thing that you do for me (I love you)
I love you you you you you, you you you
And every little thing that you do for me (I love you)
