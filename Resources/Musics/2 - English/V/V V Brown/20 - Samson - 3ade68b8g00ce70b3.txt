SAMSON

Samson, I told you
To stay far away and just make your body right
Delilah, she tricked him
And took all his strength and turned him into the light

He's lost now
So lost now
Everything he stood for has come into the light

Oh my god, what I'd give if I just had enough
(Just had enough)
Hold him tight, grab a sword, I'll get you
Oh my god, what I'd give if I just had enough
(Just had enough)
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Get up and rise!

Build up your power
And pull down those buildings and make your body right
Delilah, she cut off your hair
But it's nothing your gaining
You're fighting light, fighting light, fight light

Oh my god, what I'd give if I just had enough
(Just had enough)
Hold him tight, grab a sword, I'll get you
Oh my god, what I'd give if I just had enough
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Get up and rise!

You've been deceieved by the one who's the love of your life
And it has changed, now you're strong
So just get up and rise!

Oh my god, what I'd give if I just had enough
(Just had enough)
Hold him tight, grab a sword, I'll get you
Oh my god, what I'd give if I just had enough
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Get up and rise!
