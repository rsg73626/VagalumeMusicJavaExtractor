TRAVELLING LIKE THE LIGHT

Is there any wonder why I'm shining so tonight?
Is there any wonder why I speed like motorbikes?
Is there any wonder how you make me feel alright?

You know it ain't easy
You know it's so hard when love comes

I try to deny when my soul feels butterflies
And I try to resist when you say it's alright
And I try to believe that it's nothing but a cross
But it's incredible, so incredible

I'm travelling like the light
Light, light, light, light
Light, light, light, light

Is there any wonder why you give me little chill?
Is there any wonder why this feels sincere and real?
Is there any wonder why I'm running through the night?
Is there any wonder why this feeling gives me fright?

So you know it ain't easy
You know it's so hard when love comes

I try to deny when my soul feels butterflies
And I try to resist when you say it's alright
And I try to believe that it's nothing but a cross
But it's incredible, so incredible

I'm travelling like the light
Light, light, light, light
Light, light, light, light

It's so complicated how your feelings can get you
And your heart wants to just run away, it's so blind
Confusing and gets so frustating
When you love and you don't wanna give it up, no

I try to deny when my soul feels butterflies
And I try to resist when you say it's alright
And I try to believe that it's nothing but a cross
But it's incredible, so incredible

I'm travelling like the light
