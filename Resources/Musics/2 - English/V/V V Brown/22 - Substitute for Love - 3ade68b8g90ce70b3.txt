SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE

How can this be right?
Keep my feet on solid ground
Fall upon my knees
Watch me as I breathe

Give me your time
Give me your space
Give me your heart
I don't know why it's come to this
I'm fallen

Give me your time
Give me your space
Give me the entire human race
Give me your heart
Give your life
I call this treason

I'm your substitute for love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for love
I'll be your drug
I'll be your heroin
Put me inside your veins
And let me in
I'm your substitute for love

Call me when you need me
I will be your slave
There's a necessary will
All, always

Give me your love
Give your heart
Call me when you need me
When you come around
I'll be your crutch
Cause there's no need to call me
I'll be waiting there

I'll be your wall
I'll be your wrong
I'll be your necessary there
And if you'll have it all
It doesn't matter
Whether right or wrong

I'm your substitute for love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for love
I'll be your drug
I'll be your heroin
Put me inside your veins
And let me in
I'm your substitute for love

Fall on my knees
I'm begging please
Won't you join me?
I want to be loved for life

I'm your substitute for love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for love
I'll be your drug
I'll be your heroin
Put me inside your veins
And let me in
I'm your substitute for love
