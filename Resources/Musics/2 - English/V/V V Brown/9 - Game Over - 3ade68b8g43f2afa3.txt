GAME OVER

I’m in the same old mess again 
Another love has reached the end 
You never really gave a damn 
I thought you were a better man 

Oh no, you got me in a headlock 
Checking my alarm clock 
Now there’s nothing 

It don’t mean a thing ‘cos i don’t wanna mess around with a joker 
And i don’t really care ‘cos this is my life not a game of poker 
And i don’t give a damn my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober 
So can you get the jist i’m gonna make a move ‘cos the game is over 

I gave you 20 000 chances 
And put up with your cheating glances 
So open up that prison door 
’cos i don’t love you anymore 

Oh no, you got me in a headlock 
Checking my alarm clock 
Now there’s nothing 

It don’t mean a thing ‘cos i don’t wanna mess around with a joker 
And i don’t really care ‘cos this is my life not a game of poker 
And i don’t give a damn my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober 
So can you get the jist i’m gonna make a move ‘cos the game is over 

Oh no I’ve started a war 
My emotions are just cutting me raw 
Oh no you lowered your score 
’cos you messed up good and i cannot ignore 
Oh no tears galore 
But i changed my mind ‘cos he’s broken the law 
Oh no, I’ve seen it before 
And your system’s about to crash to the floor 
Crash to the floor 
Crash to the floor 
Crash to the floor 

It don’t mean a thing ‘cos i don’t wanna mess around with a joker 
And i don’t really care ‘cos this is my life not a game of poker 
And i don’t give a damn my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober 
So can you get the jist i’m gonna make a move ‘cos the game is over
