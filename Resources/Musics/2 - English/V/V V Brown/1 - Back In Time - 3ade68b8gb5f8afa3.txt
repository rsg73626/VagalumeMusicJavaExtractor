BACK IN TIME

I never knew a love could make me feel this way
I'm praying that I'll see another light or day
Because you got me falling on my beggin' knees
I'm asking for a better explanation please

Te-e-e-e-ee-ell-a me

If you don't love me so
Why won't you let me go
I'm running out of time
Forever will i cry
If you don't want me near
Why won't you disappear
I'm hanging round to lie

Because you shot me for sure
I didn't wanna walk out the door
I'm living in the thoughts of before
I didn't wanna change my mind
Now we're back in time
Shot me for sure
I didn't wanna walk out the door
I'm living in the thoughts of before
I didn't wanna change my mind
Now we're back in time

Why do you want to hurt me, i did nothing wrong
(why do you wanna hurt me i did nothing wrong)
I made a dedication to your heart so strong
(i made a dedication to your heart so strong)
Cuz when you said 'it's over' i could no believe
(cuz when you said 'it's over' i could no believe)
So why you wanna stay around and torture me?

Te-e-e-e-ee-ell-a me

I'm living in the thoughts of before
I didn't wanna change my mind
Now we're back in time
