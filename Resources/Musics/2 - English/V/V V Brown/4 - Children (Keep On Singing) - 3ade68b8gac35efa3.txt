CHILDREN (KEEP ON SINGING)

Buildings come crumbling
Right to the ground
And I can't help noticing
When I'm looking around
When I'm looking around

Windows can't see in 'em
To let me lies
We won't be taking it
Look 'em right in the eyes
Look 'em right in the eyes

Oh, if I had my way
I'd throw everything away
I'd draw it all up again
Keep walking with me

Oh, if I had my way
I'd give everything I have
To make everything okay

Sing it with me

Darkness falls and kills the light
Don't surrender, be alright
Fuse blow up like dynamite
And the children keep on singing, singing

Darkness falls and kills the light
Don't surrender, be alright
Innocence like flying kites
And the children keep on singing, singing

Walking down Penny Lane
Walk, walk of gold
Follow the rainbow
To the end of the road
To the end of the road

Still got me nothing
Nothing but road
They say 'It's funny'
I'm not getting the joke
I'm not getting the joke

Oh, if I had my way
I'd throw everything away
I'd draw it all up again
Keep walking with me

Oh, if I had my way
I'd give everything I have
To make everything okay

Sing it with me

Darkness falls and kills the light
Don't surrender, be alright
Fuse blow up like dynamite

And the children keep on singing, singing

Darkness falls and kills the light
Don't surrender, be alright
Innocence like flying kites
And the children keep on singing, singing

Chid, Miss V.V. Brown
I'll hold you down

Watching the Tv, man, kids just want to be famous
And be a big star, rather be known than be nameless
If I had my away, I'd draw it all up again
Can't take a loss, we must stood up and win
Momma was hurting and she couldn't spend a penny more
But why nobody have real dreams anymore
Forget the issues and worries this is something about
Supporting optimistic dreams when it's crumbling down

Sing it with me

Darkness falls and kills the light
Don't surrender, be alright
Fuse blow up like dynamite
And the children keep on singing, singing

Darkness falls and kills the light
Don't surrender, be alright
Innocence like flying kites
And the children keep on singing, singing

And the children keep on singing, singing [x2]
