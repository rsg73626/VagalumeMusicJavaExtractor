BOTTLES

How can I find the way to tell you this,
but things you seem to do all over me?
Grab the dictionary, understand the meaning:
"I want you to myself exclusively"

Kinda funny how the love has come and gone
Not trying to look grown
To all the fellas trying to look
I'm sorry that I took "Available" out

Seven on the car sit
Six by the back street
Five on the concrete (How many bottles on the...)
Four by the window
Three in the shadow
Two only but you're my one only bottle on the wall

Oh, I tell no lie, you made me fall blind to all the other guys within my life
It's not complicated when you find the one it's easy to begin to realize

Kinda funny how the love has come and gone
Not trying to look grown
To all the fellas trying to look
I'm sorry that I took "Available" out

Seven on the car sit
Six by the back street
Five on the concrete (How many bottles on the...)
Four by the window
Three in the shadow
Two only but you're my one only bottle on the wall

Seven in the café
Six in the alley
Five by the motorway (How many bottles on the...)
Four on the underground
Three in the jail pound
Two only but you're my one only bottle on the wall

I knew that if I fell in love, then yes, it would just be
Oh, no, but then the world became so linear to me

Seven on the car sit
Six by the back street
Five on the concrete (How many bottles on the...)
Four by the window
Three in the shadow
Two only but you're my one only bottle on the wall

Seven in the café
Six in the alley
Five by the motorway (How many bottles on the...)
Four on the underground
Three in the jail pound
Two only but you're my one only bottle on the wall
