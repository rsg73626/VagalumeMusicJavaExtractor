SHARK IN THE WATER

Sometimes I get my head in a dizzy
Feeling so lost, ticking you off
Now boy, you know me well
Said, I'm that kind of feeling
That kind of soft, that kind of silly
But when I'm in doubt, I open my mouth
And words come out, words come out like

Baby, there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon

High in the sky, the song that I'm singing
A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry
Rather have you lie yeah, so that's why I'm bringing
Some tricks up my sleeve, for noticing me
I wouldn't cause you any harm, I just want you in my arms
I can't help, I can't help myself

Baby, there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Better be soon)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do x2)

Right is right
Rules are rules
This is what I give for you
I'm just winding you up, oh
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Please don't make too much of it
It ain't that serious

Baby, there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
You better get here soon

Baby, there's a shark in the water
Baby, there's a shark in the water
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
