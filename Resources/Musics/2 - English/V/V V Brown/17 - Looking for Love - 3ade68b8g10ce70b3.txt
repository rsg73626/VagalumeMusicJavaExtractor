LOOKING FOR LOVE

Calling out in my heart
I can feel nobody
In my body no love
What I want

Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you really need
Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you really see

Nobody inside
Sculpture empty in the night
Call me
Sitting on the beach
Do you really love me?

Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you really need
Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you see

Running through the woods
Gotta figure out will this be
But I'm gonna love you anywhere

Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you really need
Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you need

I don't wanna give you this excuse
But I know

Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you really need
Tell me what you're looking for
Tell me what you really see
