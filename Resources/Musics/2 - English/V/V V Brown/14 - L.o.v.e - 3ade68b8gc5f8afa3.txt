L.O.V.E

You best believe I'm in love baby!

She's got that deep in lies
Wants a little something from a special guy
It's there right in her eye
No, she's not pretending she can tell no lies
She's hiding like a spy
Hoping he will take her body to the sky
Love makes her start to fly
She feels a little sweeter like an apple pie
She's got that crazy side
Wants to open up so he can realize
That she is paralysed
By the divas hangin' over compromise

Oh, love me, oh oh oh
Just love me, oh oh oh
Just hold me, oh oh oh
Just kiss me, oh oh oh
Just want me, oh oh oh
L.O.V.E.
Love, love, love, love!

Don't try to run away
'Cause you know that it will get you down some day
Those secrets in your life
Fallin' for your love will never be the same
Can't speak or play the game
You (?) forgot your name
You stutter by his face
Or maybe her reflection on the windowframe
What's this you want to say?
How you wish that you could tell them either way
But then you start to flower
Open up and tell them it's the final hour

Oh, love me, oh oh oh
Just love me, oh oh oh
Just hold me, oh oh oh
Just kiss me, oh oh oh
Just want me, oh oh oh
L.O.V.E.
Love, love, love, love! (x2)

How you just fell in love
Fell a little harder than you thought you would
How deep is bitter love
Gotta let it out because you've had enough
How it is crazy tough
Heart beats a little faster when you're feeling
touched
This situation's rough
I'm standing in the rain and I'm beaten up
Put up your blue umbrella
Have a little courage to tell him, tell her
But it is now or never
Forget about the rain and all the crazy weather

Oh, love me, oh oh oh
Just love me, oh oh oh
Just hold me, oh oh oh
Just kiss me, oh oh oh
Just want me, oh oh oh
L.O.V.E.
Love, love, love, love! (x2)
