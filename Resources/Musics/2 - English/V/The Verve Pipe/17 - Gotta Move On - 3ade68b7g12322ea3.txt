GOTTA MOVE ON

Written by Donny Brown

Love is not strong
Love is not stable
I tried to hold it
But I wasn't able
I never thought that I'd be
Saying this to you
But what else could I do?
Love leads to loss
And words condescending
Love is the pathway
To unhappy endings
And if I keep my chin up
I still see clouds that look like you
So look down is what I do
You know it's all right
If you cry a little
If something inside you
Has died a little
You don't have to hide
But you gotta move on
You gotta move on
Love leads to tears
Tears lead to sadness
Sadness to memories
Memories to madness
I never thought of all
These things that love could be
But look what it did to me
You know it's all right
If you cry a little
If something inside you
Has died a little
You don't have to hide
But you gotta move on
You gotta move on
(repeat)
