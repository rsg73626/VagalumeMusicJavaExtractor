LOCAL BOYS

Written by Brian Vander Ark

Tonight I took a snapshot, guess I got a tender spot
That'll never change
I got brand new strings, someone waiting in the wings
And that'll never change
And it's good to be home tonight
Yeah, it's good to be you and me
I got nowhere to go after the show
But that's all right, yeah that's all right by me
No cop no stop cruising to the corner shop
That'll never change
Park near the backstage pass a lot of underage
That'll never change
And it's good to be home tonight
Yeah, it's good to be guaranteed
There's nowhere to go after the show
But that's all right, yeah that's all right by me
And I, I don't think you understand
I really didn't get a wristband
But could you let me in cause I'm with the band
And it's good to be home tonight
Yeah, it's good to be guaranteed
I got a place to crash after the bash
It's called home tonight and that's all right by me
And all the kids sing boy we don't like what you became
Since you made it well it isn't the same
But I guess that's really typical of fame
