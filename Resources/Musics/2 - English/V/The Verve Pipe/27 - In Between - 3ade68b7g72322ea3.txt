IN BETWEEN

In march I met my wonderlove
Then lost her underneath the april showers
By may we worked out our difference
By june the petals were all plucked from flowers

In between my girl
And there is no other in this world, oh no
I am in between my girl
And it's gonna be a brighter day
If she'd get the nerve to stay

Hey would you mind standing in for
I only need you for this weekday evening
Saturday, I never knew you
Sorry dear, you really need to understand that I am

In between

She always gives me the runaround
She left me for a college boy
As sure as the world is round
Next semester she'll be back again
We're always off and on again
But for awhile I'll surely keep your number

In between
