CRASH LANDING

All of the places we once shared
They don't feel the same without you
Our favourite song that plays on the air
But it doesn't sound the same without you

I'm hearing words noone spoken
And I can feel my heart beat
Though I know it's broken
Nothing is the way it seems
Like being awake in a dream

And now you're gone and I'm standing
In the middle of the room crash landing
I've got my feet on the ground
But it feels like falling down, down, down
I'm crash landing

How can something be at the end
But feel like it's going on forever
So many things you rush to attend
And when you're there it's just the next whatever

Surrounded by friends but still lonely
Millions of hearts aching but mine's the only one
That can't come back from this
It's a slap when you expect a kiss

And now you're gone and I'm standing
Right in the middle of the room crash landing
I've got my feet on the floor
But it feels like falling down, down, down
Since you haven't been around, round, round
I'm crash landing

And the stars they've been bright under this bright night
And the

Nothing is the way it seems
Like living awake in a dream

And now you're gone and I'm standing
Right in the middle of the room crash landing
I've got my feet on the floor
But it feels like falling down, down, down, down, down
Since you haven't been around
And now you're gone and I'm standing
Right in the middle of the room crash landing
I've got my feet on the floor
But it feels like falling down, down, down
Since you haven't been around, round, round
