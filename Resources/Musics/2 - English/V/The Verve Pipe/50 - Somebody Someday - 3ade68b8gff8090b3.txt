SOMEBODY SOMEDAY

There's a promise of an open road
A wanderlust awoken
But that promise is a pinky swear
And its likely to be broken
Throwing dollars at the desperate times
Begging borrowing sometimes thieving again
But God knows I ain't giving up
Broken promises be damned
Oh man I'm going to feast tonight
If I could just get through to the table
I'm the one with the biggest fight
â€˜Cause I can't go back and I won't go back

Hear me talking to myself again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday
I'm talking to the walls again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday

Marley's shrugging off a broken back
Just another disposition
Now I'm stuck here in a graveyard shift
No chance of a new position
Throwing voices up the empty stairs
It's all goodbyes, see you later
I'll give you a call
That's no way to live a life
Not seeing your face at all
You said you felt the baby kick today
And I had a revelation
Yes this town it has tentacles that
Pull you back but we won't... go back

Hear me talking to myself again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday
I'm talking to the walls again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday

You're the one good thing I've done
And I won't go back no I won't go back

Hear me talking to myself again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday
I'm talking to the walls again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday

I'm talking to myself again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday
I'm talking to the walls again
Gonna be someone
Gonna be somebody someday
