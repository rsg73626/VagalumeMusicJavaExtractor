CUP OF TEA

I'm visiting 
the ground's a little weathered where I stood 
right field in my neighborhood 
I was mostly last, always least 
dig it 

At graduation everyone 
will throw their hats into the sun 
then they'll drop like flies to the sea 
this is not my cup of tea 

And valerie 
the winter won't be keeping her around 
I'm nailing leaves to the ground 
but it feels like sand underneath 
dig it 

She's never letting me forget 
I've always been an idiot 
and at times like this I agree 
this is not my cup of tea 

Crash 

In a wrinkle of steel we are gone 
will my last breath be a yawn 
watching them sorting debris 
this is not my cup of tea
