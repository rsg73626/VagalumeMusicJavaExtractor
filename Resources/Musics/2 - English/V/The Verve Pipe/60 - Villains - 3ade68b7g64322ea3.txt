VILLAINS

I turned the volume up this morning 
till there was ringing in my ears 
i haven't felt this good in years 

Another villain on the cover 
of every major magazine 
the victim somewhere in between 

See how they twist and shout 

And as i'm searching for the story 
subscription card falls to the floor 
i'm losing interest more and more 

To pick it up i'm bending over 
out of the corner of my eye 
I see a pair of blazing thighs 

See how they twist and shout 
See how they twist and shout 

I straighten up to look her over 
and up my back a shooting pain 
it's bound to settle in my brain 

Another villain on the cover 
of every major magazine 
the victim somewhere in between 

See how they twist and shout 
See how they twist and shout
