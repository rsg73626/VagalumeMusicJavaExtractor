THE RIVER

She fell in love with a lover boy
In the old days I would walk alone
Any other day not disturbing
While the others roamed

And I listened to her song
But would walk on the other side
We'd be lonely, blue and lonely

Then she fell in love with another one
I was older now, and followed a path
She had learned to be cool, to be caring
And I thought I should say
It's too much just to be
But not enough for the life of me
To be lonely, blue and lonely

That's when the river ran dry
That's when the river was all but a spill
That's when the river ran dry
Every soul on the shore
Without sail, without will

She said her saviour was soon to come
From a long way, to bring back the girl he once knew
To be true and all loving
In the very best ways

And I listened to her song
But would walk on the other side
We'd be lonely, blue and lonely

That's when the river ran dry
That's when the river was all but a spill
That's when the river ran dry
Every soul on the shore
Without sail, without will

If time were a second
If life were a moment that once stood still
I'd leave it untattered, untouched, until

But it's too much just to be
But not enough for the life of me
To be lonely, blue and lonely

She fell in love with a lover boy
In the old days, I would walk alone
Any other day not disturbing

And I listened to her song
But would walk on the other side
We'd be lonely, blue and lonely

That's when the river ran dry
That's when the river was all but a spill
That's when the river ran dry
Every soul on the shore
Without sail, without will
And I knew it before, and I do know it still
