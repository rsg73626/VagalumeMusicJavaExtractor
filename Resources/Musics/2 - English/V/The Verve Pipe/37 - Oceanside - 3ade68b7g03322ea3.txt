OCEANSIDE

She never wanted to talk
She never wanted to argue
But that's the way it goes
When there's nobody listening

Eyes straight on the front line
Knee deep in the river flow
Keep your chin up, keep your back straight
Rescue's on the way

Always the keeper of secrets
Always the source of confusion
But that's the way it goes
When there's nobody listening

Eyes straight on the front line
Knee deep in the river flow
Keep your chin up, keep your back straight
Rescue's on the way

Nobody said this was going to be easy
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

Can I take you to an oceanside
Can I take you to an oceanside
For a few hundred years
I'm telling you that's all I ever heard about it
Can I take you to an oceanside

Never a word of intention
Never a hope of reunion
But that's the way it goes
When there's nobody listening

Eyes straight on the high wire
Knee deep in the river flow
Keep your chin up, keep your back straight
Rescue's on the way

Nobody said this was going to be easy
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
