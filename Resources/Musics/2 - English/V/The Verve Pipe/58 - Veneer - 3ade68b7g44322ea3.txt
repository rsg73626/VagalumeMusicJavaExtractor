VENEER

Thirteen miles on 31 are drying
All along adopt-a-highway
lay the empty cans of masquerade

Thirteen miles on 31 are drying
The sky is lavender with ivory clouds
that threaten drops of finger-paints
Puddle jumping children clad in yellow raincoats
splash the deeper purple of
Veneer

Rows and rows of animals
their shiver skin is painted different shades
And from grazing tainted grass
their teeth are stained the incandescent green
Indifferent they watch the rainfall steady
blend their spots and run their
Stripes of veneer

Lovely ladies strip themselves of furs the winds require
Lovely ladies bathe themselves in technicolor mire
Lovely gentlemen

At 85 on 31 I'm flying
Flying
