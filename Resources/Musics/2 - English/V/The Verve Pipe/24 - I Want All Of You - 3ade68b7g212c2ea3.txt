I WANT ALL OF YOU

Written by Donny Brown and Adam Schlesinger

I want all of you
I want all of you
From your feet up to your mouth
Every inch of north and south
I'll keep calling you
I'll keep calling you
Won't you listen to me say
Don't you ever go away
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
I'll be waiting here for you
Anything that I can do
Will you think of me?
Will you think of me?
Whisper words into your ears
I will never bring you tears
I want all of you
(Ah ah ah ah...)
You are everything
You are everything
From your elbows to your lips
Down your arms to fingertips
I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
In the rain and bright sunshine
Won't you say that you'll be mine
You are in my heart
You are in my heart
From the dusk into the light
Every day and every night
I want all of you
(Ah ah ah ah...)
And when I see you smile
You can make the darkest day worthwhile
And when you look my way
I need you to believe me when I say
I want all of you
(Ah ah ah ah...)
I love all of you
I love all of you
From your fingers to your toes
From your knees up to your nose
I'll be here for you
I'll be here for you
Anytime and any place
Just to see your pretty face
You are everything
You are everything
In my night and through my day
Would you listen to me say
I'm in love with you
I am in love with you
I am in love with you...
