PHOTOGRAPH

And if you want beautiful, pitiful, have me in a picture 
And if you want make me dance, throw me round, spin upon your finger 

Blind labors the blind and I am unwilling to uncover my eyes 

And if you want take your time rifle through, find a very nice one 
If there's a crease in my face over time, there's plenty more where that came from

Words frozen, will thaw when I am wasted, I am... better shut up 
And a frame is quite confining, hang me up...hang me up 

I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph... yeah yeah

(Picture this)

When i'm alone and the world is a fist, I am weightless 
A universe, gravitate, orchestrates, well I am fearless
And spin, the sky surrounding free from all the picture perfect 
And spin the sky surrounding, larger than life, meanwhile

I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph... hey yeah

::interlude::

I'm in the photograph
(see me still)
I'm in the photograph
(see me still)
I'm in the photograph... hey yeah yeah
(see me still x 3)
