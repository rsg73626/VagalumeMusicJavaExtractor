SHE LOVES EVERYBODY

She loves everybody she loves everyone
Like the picture taken twenty years ago
That she keeps in her portfolio
He wants everybody he wants anything
And they part the rope outside the whiskey bar
A glitter gown in orbit left to satellite a waning star

I touch down in the heated land
And shiver in my bones
As I look up to greet the clouds that wait for me
Washed aside by circumstance
The watercloth had cleared the answer in my mind
And you were there with me, there with me again

She loves everybody she loves everyone
The evidence sits in the vcr
He's choking on apologies, she's channeling a superstar

I tiny elbow through the crowd
Flashing lights, the music's loud
I'm questioning if this is destiny
Disappearing from the rants
Ignoring risen sycophants, I close my eyes
And you were there with me
There with me, there with me again

She loves everybody she loves everyone
