HAPPINESS IS

Written by Donny Brown

The world is giving you the run-around
And leaves you feeling low and let down but
Happiness is 
Wherever you find it

I'm not waiting for a friend beside me
Or for the lord above to guide me
My happiness is 
Wherever I find it 
And I wanna find it with you

Have you ever felt so out of place
That the smile on your face
Was to keep from cryin'
I don't know how we get so out of touch
But I don't want much
Just to find out
What happiness is

While everybody else is winning
You're stuck waiting for your new beginning
So happiness is
Wherever you find it

You may be full of life's frustrations
But I'm up for negotiations
My happiness is
Wherever I find it
And I wanna find it with you
Have you ever felt...
If you got your lucky break and broke it
I guess you've got your options open
But happiness is

Wherever you find it...yeah
And I wanna find it with you
Have you ever felt so out of place
That the smile on your face
Was to keep from cryin'
I don't know how we get so out of touch
But I don't want much
Just to keep on tryin'
People say a prayer every day
That they end up with more than their next door
neighbor
I'm not buying all their ego trips
But I'll get my kicks
When I find out 
What happiness is
