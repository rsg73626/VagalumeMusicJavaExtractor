GENERATIONS

I awoke to a threat that was empty
And a grandstand of I'm not through with you yet
A slamming door becomes my punctuation
I escape for a thrill ride with my friends
They agree to be temporary guardians
Man, it's so appreciated, summer day intoxicated
With those who can relate, 2 months, a day, a wakeup

Drink it down, dear brother, their generation smothers you
And we'll leave no trail to discover
Build a callus sister, they're generation blisters
Another wakeup with the morning hung over
We gonna pack up or waste another killer day
Then our heads exploded, overload when we decide

Hello... we're so out of here
Hitchhike to canada
With backpacks full of cigarettes and beer
Man, it's so appreciated, summer day intoxicated
With those who can relate, 2 months, a day, a wakeup

Drink it down, dear brother
Listen up dear father, your generation bothers me
And I'll leave you to grieve with my mother

Build a callus sister, they're generation blisters

Now empty your bottles and open the throttles
There's plenty of fighting ahead
Those fists weren't made for resting your head

Shield your eyes, dear mother, from the pain that hovers
Round the mess of a man you've uncovered
Drink it down, dear brother
We'll blister
