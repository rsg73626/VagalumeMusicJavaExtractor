ACTING AS YOUR SLAVE

my hand asleep for hours 
waiting for the needles to begin 
i have no control 
they proceed to penetrate my skin 

acting as your slave i drink for amber waves 
i never have embraced 
acting as your slave i drink an open grave 
an epitaph defaced 

killing with compassion 
she hasn't heard a word that i have said 
swallowing your passion 
i can see a thousand miles ahead 

acting as your slave i drink for barricades 
that i have often raised 
acting as your slave i numb my head and rave 
of epitaphs defaced 

acting as your slave i drink while she forgave 
with trials left unfaced 
acting as your slave i stumble to her grave 
an epitaph defaced
