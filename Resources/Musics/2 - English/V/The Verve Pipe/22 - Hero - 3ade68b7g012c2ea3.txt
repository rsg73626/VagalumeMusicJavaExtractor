HERO

I can't believe that it was good for anyone
To be worth the wait
I tried to send you with your money's worth
But attention sure felt great
With all eyes upon me, some filled with tears
The most couldn't see

It burned like a cancer when the answer did occur to me
Creep from the cradle, but a hero's what I wanna be
Keep it moving people
Cause there's nothing more for you to see
I'm just a jerk, but a hero's what I wanna be yeah, oh yeah

Love me, love me sweet cowardice
Now that the thrill is mine for the moment
We really didn't need another suicide
Or a song explaining why, but not dignified
But I can't seem to kiss it goodbye

It burned like a cancer when the answer did occur to me
Creep from the cradle, but a hero's what I wanna be
Keep it moving people
Cause there's nothing more for you to see
I'm just a jerk, but a hero's what I wanna be yeah, oh yeah

Erase this disaster even faster than you came to see
A creep from the cradle and a hero driven wanna be
For your abuse, but not intended for internal use
I'm just a jerk, but a hero's what I wanna be

Burned like a cancer when the answer did occur to me
Creep from the cradle but a hero's what I wanna be
Yea... yea... yea... yea
