NEVER LET YOU DOWN

Refrão:
I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
I'm getting to like this feeling I've found
I'm getting to love the thought of 
Having you around and
I will never let you down

Your friends were all well-meaning
When they said no one is good enough for you
But if they play with your emotions
Dismiss the notion
And do what you have to do
Cause people don't take chances with their hearts
Since I've met you I am past the hardest part
So remember one thing
I will never let you down

Refrão

Sometimes you feel defeated
But it's OK...
You're not the only one
And all the complications,
The bad situations - happen to everyone
It doesn't matter how it ended or began
Sometimes the best that you can do is change your plans
I hope you understand that
I will never let you down

Refrão
