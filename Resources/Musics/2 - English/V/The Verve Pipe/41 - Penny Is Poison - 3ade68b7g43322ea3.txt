PENNY IS POISON

Blushing a cue for her falsities 
advantage is my only masterpiece 

Penny is poison but I don't mind 
Penny is poison but I don't mind 

Gardening malice for murderers 
flushes to me are the weeds to her 

We know who we are 

Starving the love of the marvelous 
I was the penny to previous
