HEADLINES

I met a girl with bottles of wine
Though I prefer red, they tasted all right
Very soon, the room was spinning
Tug of war, the floor was winning

That's when she said
I can't help but laugh when I'm caught in a lie
I'm not who you thought, but you can kiss me good night
Her mouth was full of dirty words
Then cigarettes burned afterwards, that's when she said

Having a headline must be some experience
Having a headline's a sexual experience

Letters and postcards I meant to respond
Turned out my all was just medium
Then came one that said the only thing you ever gave
were bad directions
I'd say it to your face but I can't find you

Having a headline

I loved the fame and fashion
till she said you better ration the good times
I wouldn't count on the good times

Having a headline
