MILES AWAY

Written by Brian Vander Ark

Today was a great day
I said but I meant
Today was the worst day I've ever spent
I'm trying to be what you want me to be
So you'll settle down
Stop driving me into the ground

Well it might be how you fight me till I'm shattered
I would leave you but to leave you wouldn't matter
So beneath you, underneath you I am right here
Miles away

Today was a strange day
I meant what I said
Today was the first day that I looked ahead
And if I could be what you want me to be
Would you let me down
Stop driving me into the ground

Well it might be how you fight me till I'm shattered

I would leave you but to leave you wouldn't matter
So beneath you, underneath you, I am right here 
Miles away

Can I have your attention, have your respect
We all need redemption, some more or less

Now you fight me satellite me till I'm shattered
I would leave you but to leave you wouldn't matter
So beneath you, underneath you I am right here
Miles away
Or it may be how you play me till I'm shattered
I defend it and pretend it doesn't matter
If you need me then believe me i'll be right here
Miles away
