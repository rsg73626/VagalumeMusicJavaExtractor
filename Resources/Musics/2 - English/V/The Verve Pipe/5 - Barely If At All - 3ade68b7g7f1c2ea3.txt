BARELY IF AT ALL

When my love complained, every word 
a breath on my last dandelion 
and so lovers will leave and their tears 
souvenirs for the very first time 

I searched the world reluctant 
to find a lover enthusiastic 
speak to me barely if at all 

When I was a boy, funny things 
water wings kept you confident 
a belly of wine, similar 
to keep yourself indifferent 

And I scraped the bargain basement 
bought a lover less than fantastic 
spoke to me barely if at all 

Taste perfume that burns my throat 
and i am free of envelope 
squeeze an instant out of me 

And she placed a hand between our lips 
how could anything be so precious 
she kissed me barely if at all 

And she, with her hand between our lips 
gave me what we now have in common 
she left me barely if at all
