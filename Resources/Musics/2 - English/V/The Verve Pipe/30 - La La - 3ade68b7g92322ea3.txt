LA LA

With everyone around us singing la la
We slid out of their view
Then you thought you heard me singing la la
But I don't have the strength to

And from the moment that I give out we begin to live out
Scenes from all romantic prose while tethered to the roles
Or what was meant disguised as sentiment could hang
Misunderstood and left unanswered

Your eyes tell me I have what I wanted
Haunted as I hold you
Nervous slacking with the lacking heartache
No heartbreak when I told you

And though I never did surrender
Could you please remember
If and when we meet again we once were more than friends
Embarrassed me but would you share a scene and kiss me
One last time before I leave you

And though I won't surrender I want you to remember
If and when we meet again we'll still be more than friends
Grant me this it could seem frivolous, but kiss me
One last time before I leave you

You've got all my loving in a tangle that I could never undo
You will never hear me singing la la
I guess la la means I love you
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la means I love you, love you
