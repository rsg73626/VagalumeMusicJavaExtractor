OMINOUS MAN

I should be half a mile from here 

I will go anywhere she goes 
shoulder the bags of a previous lover 
I will go anywhere she goes 
sleep on the pillow that reeks of another 

A will of mine to be impressive 
i'm an amorous man 

I will go anywhere she goes 
travel whenever, whatever the distance 

The court deemed me to be offensive 
i'm an ominous man 

Once love is unanimous 
no order demands 

I should be half a mile from here 

The court deemed me to be obsessive 
i'm the ominous man 
jury reject the alibi's seemingly watertight 
for the ominous man 

I am the ominous man
