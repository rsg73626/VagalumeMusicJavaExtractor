OUT LIKE A LAMB

I'm feeling very moses like
You think that I could lead you?
Or humble, more like david
Would you help me cause I need you?
Or I'll be charismatic
With the power to persuade you

Supposing I'm a saviour
Or a drunkard, or your highness
You slither in these sheets
And then you ask me for forgiveness
I'll tell you parables of making love
And spreading kindness

Flames rise like butterflies
Been frightened by my stompin'
I'm laughing 'cause they don't know who I am
The philistines toss tangerines
'cause springtime is for dancing
In like a lion and out like a lamb

Goliath sits and watches
Tired of this investigation
So children grab your m-16s
And load your ammunition
I will work all night
Rewrite the book of revelations

Flames rise like butterflies
Been frightened by my stompin'
I'm laughing 'cause they don't know who I am
The philistines toss tangerines
'cause springtime is for dancing
In like a lion and out like a lamb

Now go and tune your guitars
And I'll meet you here tomorrow
Grab that case of scotch
It's all the courage you can swallow
I'll burn for all your sins
But I'm expecting you to follow

Flames rise like butterflies
Been frightened by my stompin'
I'm laughing 'cause they don't know who I am
The philistines load magazines
'cause springtime is for dancing
In like a lion and out like a lamb
