ARK OF THE ENVIOUS

i hear the driving of the nail 
i hear the rain i hear the hail 
i hear the laughter of the 
people dancing 'round him 
as he forces his poor family to set sail 

if you don't care you will not cry 
if you don't dare you will not try 
and now i'm drowning in the dark 
with thoughts of building my own ark 

i feel my baby's on the rise 
sits there examining her thighs 
in he comes all drenching clean 
and lays upon her hard and lean 
she comes when he never even tries 

(repeat chorus) 

i'm sitting and wishing i were young 
the best lines they'd flow right off my tongue 
i'd believe that school is social banging in 
and banging out and hanging in 
and hanging out until we're hung 

(repeat chorus) 

of the envious 
i am one
