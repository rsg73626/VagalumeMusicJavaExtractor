KISS ME IDLE

Roses dead in dirty water held up by the vase
Once a gift good-bye but now remind me to replace
Hardened petals bang the dresser when they fall away
Kiss me idle

Kiss me without make-up, leave no marks upon my chest
Kiss me for no other reason then to give your eyes a rest
Kiss me slow and leave me lifeless, let this all digest
Kiss me idle

Slowly, slowly, the longer it takes
the better mistakes we end up stumbling on

I wouldn't want to leave upon your tongue a sour taste
Leave it foiled and disappointed, wanting to be chased
A mouth that's open wide and speechless
seems like such a waste
Kiss me idle

One time lazy, another time dear
despite all your fears of outlasting my love
I can't afford the stubborn
sleep on photographs of birthdays past
So close your eyes and catch your breath
and I will wait right here

I tied my fingers to remind me to leave you every day
While my hair is growing white, the strings are turning gray
One by one they come undone until they fall away
Kiss me idle kiss me idle
