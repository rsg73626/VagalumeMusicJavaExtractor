BRIAN'S SONG

so much to say, so little time
the words ring loud and true
bring forth the graceful thought
of benevolence, brightness, and hue

like others i sing with mr. vox
of strong desire burning
for the one and only you

hat pulled down, weight of the world
weight of the world on his brow
heart on his sleeves swinging fists
swinging fists at what might be broken glass

i don't believe in revolution
or the stateman's ideology
but i believe in you

if i could rethink myself
i might not act this way
we push the clock of the world
we wait for light but behold obscurity

living in a cold sweat state
cube of sugar singer
i believe in you
