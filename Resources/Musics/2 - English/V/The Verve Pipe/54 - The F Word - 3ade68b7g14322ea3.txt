THE F WORD

I've got to get arrested to keep you interested
I should have known that I
Can't change the world by staring at it
My arms have little feeling from lifting to the ceiling
A recipe for stealing hearts I have no power in healing

And I suppose the jesus pose is tired and superficial, lame
I wrote a song, I'm moving on
I'm praying you can do the same

I'm changing my direction making a correction
Oh my god, I've dodged the unexpected bullets
Behind accolades and shake your head of leisure
Get your head and body into seizure
And battle with whoever hides assault disguised as dancing

This rotting phase of hands that raise
Bumping heads that pass each other
It's a boring phase, so part the wave
And drop the dead as driftwood surfer

Another song, it all went wrong, the radio refused to play it
I'm not afraid to serenade
The f word saved and sucked the life from me

I've got to get arrested to keep you interested
I've got to get arrested
