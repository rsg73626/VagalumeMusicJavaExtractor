I'VE SUFFERED A HEAD INJURY

Vanilla ice man cometh, goeth
Sampling, dealing, music stolen
To pre-pubescent girls appealing
Re-mix record contract sealing
Borrowed lyrics sung with feeling slumping
Record sales are healing

Concert hall promoters kneeling
Keeping grateful deadheads relling
Quite suppressed yet quite revealing
Influence is far from stealing

I've suffered a head I've suffered a head injury
I've suffered a head I've suffered a head injury

Techno-pop kids, stardom's rockets
Money in their label's pocket

Unrelentless, thoughtless selling
Busting charts, atop they're dwelling
Lacking substance story telling
Lost the message in this yelling

Robbing fortunes from the willing
Endless posing, mindless chilling
Plastic icing airtime filling
Instigating art-rock killing

(repeat chorus)
