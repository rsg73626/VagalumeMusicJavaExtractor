IF I COULD MAKE YOU FEEL

If I could make you feel
If I could make you feel
It wouldn't matter what you feel as long as you feel it
If it's pain we'll find a way to heal it
If it's love I'll find a way to steal it, once again

If you would make believe
Sometimes I make believe
I make believe that you never meant a word that you said
That you invite me back into your bed
To fall asleep, my head to your head and share a dream
If I could make you feel

If I could ever make you feel
You'd feel the pleasure and the pain in equal share
If I could make you share
You'd share your life with me and then

I want to make you weak
I want to make you cry
And when you cry for me I'm ready with my arms wide open
And I am everything that you were hoping
Look at me I'm just a book wide open, mark the page
The day I made you feel

If I could ever make you feel
You'd feel the pleasure and the pain in equal share
If I could make you share
You'd share your life with me and and no one else is there
And then it's you and me and there's a million angel voices
Can't you hear
And then it's you and me, and out of all your many choices
You choose me, you choose me
If I could make you feel, If I could make you feel
