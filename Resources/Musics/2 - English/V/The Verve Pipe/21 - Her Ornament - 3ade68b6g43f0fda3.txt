HER ORNAMENT

never really meant to volunteer
felt the urge to stretch after a yawn
and accidentally raised my hand
i just want to be her special

someone who will never pioneer
i prefer to watch the mudd break off her heels
and turn into cement
i just want to be her ornament

her shadow seems much cooler
camouflage myself
and plan a splendid entrance

i just want to be her situation pending expectation...
i just want to be her ornament

i never really meant to volunteer
i fought the urge to stretch after a yawn
and accidentally lost my head

i just want to be her exploitation and abbreviation...
i just want to be her ornament
