CLEAN BREAK

I think you need some assistance
To keep yourself at a distance
It's harder when she's beautiful
It's easy when she's waking next to you

If you're gonna make a break, make a clean break
If you're gonna make a break, break clean
If you're gonna make a break, make a clean break
If you're gonna make a break, make a clean break

I can see the tables turning
Homefires lit, your house is burning
It's harder in the evening but
It's easy in the early afternoon

(repeat chorus)

Sure there is an easy out by staying in
For one more session
You justify it all by seeing her in moderation
No opportunity for her to start a new relation
You help yourself because you're sensing
Obligation

I think it's great the way you handle
Both ends of a burning candle
It's harder when she's easy but it's easy
When she's just as hard on you

(repeat chorus)
