DRIVE YOU MILD

And if I ever drive you mild, and suffering this open kiss 
and i'm barely juvenile 

When everyone is outrageous 
and I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon 
And if I ever drive your style, and suffering your day predicted 
with no ability to rile 

And every yawn is contagious 
and I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon 

I should drive you wild 

Ever drive you mild 
Ever drive you mild 
Ever drive you mild
