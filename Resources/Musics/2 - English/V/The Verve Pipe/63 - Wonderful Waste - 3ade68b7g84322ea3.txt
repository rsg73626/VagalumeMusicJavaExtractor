WONDERFUL WASTE

Written by Brian Vander Ark and Adam Schlesinger

Well could you go any slower you're such a church goer
Got the home field advantage and all that you can manage
Is to stay home drinking the thought of it is bringing me down
Could you go any faster the night is a disaster
Cause you call with little warning gotta work in the morning
With a head that's ringing the thought of it is bringing me down
We've come this far and the worst case scenario
We're back in the car and cranking up the stereo
You're a wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
You're a wonderful waste of time
You're a slap on the wrist, you'll hardly be missed give me one more kiss
You're a wonderful waste of time

It's ten years later you're still a fornicator
Got the home field advantage all that kids that you can manage
And your trunk of returnables is weighing your convertible down
Could you go any slower you're such a church goer
Cause you call with little warning gotta work in the morning
With a phone that's ringing and the thought of it is bringing me down

We've come this far and the worst case scenario
We're back in the car and cranking up the stereo
You're a wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
You're a wonderful waste of time
You're a slap on the wrist, you'll hardly be missed give me one more kiss
You're a wonderful waste of time

And all you can manage the home field advantage
As long as you're willing to pay for the damage
We've come this far and the worst case scenario
We're back in the car and cranking up the stereo
You're a wonderful waste memory erased easily replaced
You're a wonderful waste of time
You're a slap on the wrist, you'll hardly be missed give me one more kiss
You're a wonderful waste of time
