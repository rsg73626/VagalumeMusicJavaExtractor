ANOTHER SPOONFUL OF SUGAR

I've grown tired of conversation
all the play by play
a remedy for my salvation
seems so far away
full time jobs at part time wages
all the cubicles are cages
messages and medicines to bitter for my taste

now all I'm wanting and all I'm needing
is to send my mind out of body when you come around
all I'm wanting and all I'm needing
is one more drink and a spoonful of sugar to wash it all down

family value complicated
I am not ashamed
you know I wanna be x-rated
can I hit reset, can I bum a cigarette
dirty words atract like a magnet
I've got skeletons hid so deep they're bones will turn to dust

what I know is: all I know is
I will not outgrow this like another hand-me-down
all I'm wanting, and all I'm needing
is one more drink and a spoonful of sugar to wash it down

and all I want is, and all I need is
for you to break my fall with your body when I hit the ground
and all I really want is, and all I really need is
is one more drink and a spoonful of sugar to wash it all down
