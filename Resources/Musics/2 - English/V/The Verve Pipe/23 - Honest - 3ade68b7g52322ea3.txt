HONEST

Who will leave your bed this morning?
Who will be the one
To leave you now amidst adoring light
Cause it feels right?
Who will be the one
To leave you as tomorrow's dawning?

And though I'm asking, please don't give specifics
I'm so unterrifically honest

Who will hold your door this evening?
Who will be the one
To steal the smile through shining candlelight
Cause it feels right?
Who will be the one
To leave you as tomorrow's dawning?

I'm not trying to be scientific
I'm not trying to be anything at all
But this chemistry just turns me
Turns me terribly honest
Honest

Who will leave your bed this morning?
Will he be the one
Who snuffs the smile that once had shined so bright?
Are you alright?
Will he be the one
Who leaves you as tomorrow's dawning?

I'm not trying to be sympathetic
I'm not trying to be anything at all
But this story's happened to me
And it's turned me terribly honest
Honest
