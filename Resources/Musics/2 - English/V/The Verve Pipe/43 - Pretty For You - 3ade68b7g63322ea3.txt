PRETTY FOR YOU

Swallow this scene, I'm on fire
Arms waving, burning higher
Impressing you with what I've done
But every minute I'm losing one by one

Swallow this scene, sharpen knives
Pin cushion, pierce my sides
And every blade will catch the sun
And every minute I'm losing one by one

Right now pretty for you
Am I finally pretty?

An ornament for everyone
But every minute I'm losing one by one

Swallow this scene, there is laughter
For the ugly ever-after
And after they have poked their fun
And every lover I'm losing one by one
