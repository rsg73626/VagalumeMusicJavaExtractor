HALF A MIND

Sometimes I wish we had a short term memory
Just enough to recognize each other's face
It would be the same old stories
But you're hanging onto every single word I have to say
And to the world I'm not that clever
But you would stay with me forever
I'd keep your friends from reminding
Reminding you to save yourself, leave me behind
You would if you had half a mind
I'd tell you every day's your birthday
And every gift I bring could be the same
Or how I stood beside you at a shotgun
Wedding and the child we once would love but never came
Hearing stories that were never
You would stay with me forever
But I'd forget to make money and you'd forget to

Save yourself, leave me behind you would
If you had half a mind (how vulnerable you are)
Write a note to remind you you would if you had half a mind
(how effortless to stay together)
For these ties you may have severed
Now you'll stay with me forever

And so you write on your forehead
Or better yet you engrave
So when you look in the mirror, well you won't forget to

Save yourself, leave me behind you would
If you had half a mind (how vulnerable you are)
Write a note to remind you you would if you had half a mind
(how effortless to stay together)
If we had no memory whatsoever
We would stay right here forever
