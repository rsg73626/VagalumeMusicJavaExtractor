SPOONFUL OF SUGAR

I adore a confrontation, and I should be ashamed 
a carnival of complication, everyone's to blame 
we can see the rocket's red glare 
pipe bomb bursting in the air 
as we proudly hail our taxis out of the fight 

singing born of this nation of white bread foundation 
we're taping a king, beaten of his crown 
my country 'tis of thee, sweet land of irony 
spoonful of sugar to wash it down 

i have seen the hungry faces, and i have been removed 
evidence in welfare cases, never being proved 
we've written books on education 
summoned federal regulation 
skeleton hid deeply 'til its bones turn to dust 

i know an old lady who swallowed a fly 
i don't know why exactly, i guess she'll die 
my country 'tis of thee, sweet land of irony 
spoonful of sugar to wash it down 

and god save the queen, oh, and pardon the king 
and our ballots we'll stuff, then drink 'till we drown 
my country 'tis of thee, sweet land of irony 
spoonful of sugar to wash it down
