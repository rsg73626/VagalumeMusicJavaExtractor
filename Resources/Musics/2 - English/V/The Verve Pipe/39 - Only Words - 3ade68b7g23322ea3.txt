ONLY WORDS

Written by Brian Vander Ark

Through evidence of circumstance
You held me to a second chance
Feigning interest so sincere
Curse the days I've wasted here

All the words that you waste debating
Every word so intimidating
I can let a lot of things that you say go
I could never let another day go
All the words that evaporated
Every word so intimidating

I'll never make mention of it if you say so
But I could never let another day go by

Definitions you have missed
Punctuated by your fist
Feigning interest out of fear
I curse the days I've wasted here

All the words that you waste debating
Every word so intimidating
I can let a lot of things that you say go
I could never let another day go
All the words that evaporated
Every word so intimidating
I'll never make mention of it if you say so
But I could never let another day go by

Surprise yourself with every word
It's so absurd

All the words...

All the words that you punctuated
Every word so intimidating
I can let a lot of things that you say go
I could never let another day go
All the years that evaporated
All the tears that I tolerated
I'll never make mention of it if you say so
But I could never let another day go by
