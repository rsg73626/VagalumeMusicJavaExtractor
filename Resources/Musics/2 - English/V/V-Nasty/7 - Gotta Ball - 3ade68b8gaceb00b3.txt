GOTTA BALL

V-nasty

Yup, bitch it's nasty
Two two ounces and one two liter
Two styrofoam riding in the two seater
Ice in my cup keep it cold no heater
Me and lil debbie two's up hasta la vista
Ice on my neck and wrist keep me cold blooded
I ain't drinkin' syr unless that bitch real money
Activate a high tech taste so lovely
Throwing rosay equals sipping three hundred
Duh we getting money and its finna talk
Pull out twenty stacks just to buy the whole mall
I can stop now I'll be damned if I fall
Cause it's money on my mind and bitch I gotta ball

Bitch I gotta ball
Bitch I gotta ball
Bitch I gotta ball
Cause it's money on my mind man bitch I gotta ball

Lil debbie

Bitch I gotta bomb with your bitch at the mall
If I gotta a miss call it wasn't money involve
If you see me buying sprite you know it's syrup involve
Gotta smoke in slow motion like a turtle would walk ( squirt ]
Codeine diva role my weed up
Last of the trill man the rap game need us
Lil debbie last seen in a limousine
I done sip on syrup across the seven seas ( leaning ]
Hundred missed calls and I'm still balling ( balling ]
Hundred dollar sprite I'mma sip on it
Bitch I gotta ball don't sequelitis ( no ]
When you see a real bitch acknowledge it!

Bitch I gotta ball
Bitch I gotta ball
Bitch I gotta ball
Cause it's money on my mind man bitch I gotta ball
