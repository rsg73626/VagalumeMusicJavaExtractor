SUMMERTIME

Hey summertime,
I really think I'm feelin' you
Especially when you shinin' those beams like you do
Grab one beer

And

A b*tch or maybe two
And hit the sand in the water so I get cool
I see a little lady walkin' with her cheeks out
Gotta pull her by her arm and see what she's about
Can we go to hawaii so you can roll my blunts when

I get too high
She's young and fun and the sun's here with her
She's kinda cute but the b*tch is gettin' weirder
I'm gonna roll her in a ball and just kick her
Can't believe she pulled that

Sh*t at dinner
B*tch I'm done like the sun on the east side
Young kreayshawn again bounce out the g ride
Grab a burger and a chopper then I get to slide
I think I'm gonna leave her now cause it's summertime

It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is all mine

All fine, real fit, she's a sweetie
Plus she's lookin' great in her bikini
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is all mine

It's summer night and I'm sipping on the double cup
We got so much weed, we 'bout to fill the pull up
Turn up, smoke up and hit the waterslide
Keep cool 'cause you know it's too hot to bite
When it's hot out, you know the whole blocks out
Girl you're gonna get your turn, please dont start to pout
Puerto rican parade in the ma

And

We feelin' great because the sun's rays
Drink water 'cause I need to snap out of it
They say the summertime, known the season of the hits
So here's a hit, go and pass it on to all your friends

And

Slap it real loud when you're drivin' the benz
You be partyin' no need to pretend
It's your life and summertime never ends
'cause it's your life and summertime never ends

It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is all mine

All fine, real fit, she's a sweetie
Plus she's lookin' great in her bikini
It's summertime and your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime and your bitch is all mine

Summertime when them girls come out in short shorts
Candy weist, planting colors like new ports
Hot nights on the block like I'm in a fort
July comes poppin' b*tches like it's the fourth
It's summertime and your b*tch is on my line though
She keeps calling me, she ain't on my mind though
Summertime, I'll be damned if I die broke

{ out 24/7 chasing my dough }
Water fights in the hood at the barbecue
Hate to buy a lot but I only trust a few
My type, ice cold, drinking like juice
Chin up, chase it down with the grey goose
B*tches trippin' on the b*tch when they hear my name
Sippin' ciroc, connecting blunts to the flames
I'm seein' new things but I can't change
Summertime when a b*tch like me will snatch ya chain

It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime
And your bitch is all mine
All fine, real fit, she's a sweetie
Plus she's lookin' great in her bikini
It's summertime and your bitch is on my mind
It's summertime and your bitch is all mine
