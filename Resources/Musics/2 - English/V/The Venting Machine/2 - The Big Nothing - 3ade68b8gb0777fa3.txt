THE BIG NOTHING

We come to town in the dead of the night when everybody’s sleeping.
We roll in with the thickest fog. We’re outside your windows creeping.
We dig in. We take over. We’ll take you all away.

We bring the power
(Deep into your)
We bring the denied 
(Deep into your)
We bring the calloused
(Deep into your)
We bring your nothing
(Deep into your…)

It’s up to us to bring the feeding to the great darkness hunger.
So lock up and but your deadbolts in, because tonight we bring the thunder.



All fear is cast aside. It’s going down tonight
For those of you who cannot see, we will open up your eyes.
All fear is cast aside. We will liberate the light.
For those of you who cannot see, we will open up your eyes.
