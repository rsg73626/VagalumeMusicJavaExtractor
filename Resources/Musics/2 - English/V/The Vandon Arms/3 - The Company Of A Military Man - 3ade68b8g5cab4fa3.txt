THE COMPANY OF A MILITARY MAN

You're a fighter, a legend in our eyes
A hero, a model for our lives
Convictions he breaths with the biggest heart you'll see

You're my brother always dreaming of his home
With comrodery, you'll never walk alone
The good life he leads and he wears it on his sleeve

AND OUT COMES THE SUN!
Our day comes to an end
BUT WE'VE JUST BEGUN!
So come with me my friend
As long as your here keep me filled to the brim
To the brim

*Through the years and cheers and the bottles of beer 
And we never gave a damn about the morning
But what we know through our bodies and soul
Where ever you go we'll be joining*
