THE LAST TIME WE MEET

The sun retires and the day grows old
whistling in the trees and the breeze falls cold
but I found this lonely street on my own
and I'm so far from home

*So come all you lads of leisure
patrons of worthy measure
lets share a drink and forget to think tonight
for its the last time we meet*

Many things have changed from where I was weened
cigarettes and booze with love between
the kindness of strangers when you live on the streets
and all the friends we meet

The sun does shine on that open road
its all a journey but nowhere to go
so fill up on life before it beats you down
cause Lord knows that happens too soon
