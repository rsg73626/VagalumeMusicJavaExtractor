THE LEGEND OF JOHNNY GREY

GO GO JOHNNY GREY
AND A REBEL HE WILL STAY!!!

so come all brave irishmen wherever you may be
ill tell you a story that happened to me
its tis of a shooting that happened long ago
in a town called killkenny a place we all know

twas early in the morning johnny was met with the dew
by the bastard bailiff and his treacherous crew
"you couldnt pay your rent so youll pay with your land
and from the country you love, forever youll be banned"

johnny grabbed his gun and yelled "you wont take me alive!
for my true love Ireland i am prepared to die
and all the brave irishmen will share the same fate as me!"
but the bailiff knew tomorrow johnny be'd swingin from a tree

johnny pulled the trigger and the captian he fell dead
the bailiff raised his gun aim square and johnny's head
another shot was fired and the bailiff he did slay
and that is the ending of young johnny grey

so come all brave irishmen wherever you may be
dont let them transport you all over the sea
stay in your own country and defend your own land
soon we'll be free from this treacherous band
