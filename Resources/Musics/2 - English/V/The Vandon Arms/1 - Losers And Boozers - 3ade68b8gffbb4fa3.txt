LOSERS AND BOOZERS

have mercy Lord for I have sinned
damn all my vices for Ill do them again
I drink like a fish, I smoke like a flame
its all on my head i have no one to blame

(but) we're gunna drink when we get home!
we're gunna drink tonight!

*if I wake up tomorrow to see another day
maybe we could drink the day away* 

Im sick off drinkin whiskey, Im sick off drinkin gin
I want no one but my poor mother to pity the shape Im in
I miss my far away friends and my friends are dear at home
but when theyre as bad as I am, Im better off being alone


(now) we're at the local pub, Im eleven whiskeys in
I got seven more ahead of me before I turn me in
we're stumbling down 16th and I know I should be done
but all my friends around me, the night seems far too young


to most we're losers, its for damn sure we're boozers
our companys to rich to think about our future
maybe someday we'll quit, maybe someday we'll sober
maybe someday we'll find we're better off than the liquior
