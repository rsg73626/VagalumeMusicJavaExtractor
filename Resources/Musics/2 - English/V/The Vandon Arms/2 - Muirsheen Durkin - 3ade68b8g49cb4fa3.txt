MUIRSHEEN DURKIN

*It's good bye Muirsheen Durkin
I sick and tired of workin
No longer dig the pradies
No longer I'll be poor
For as sure's my name is Karney
I'll be off to Californ-e
Instead of diggin pradies 
I'll be diggin lumps of gold*

Oh in my days of courtin
I've never done resortin
To the ale house or the play house
or many the house between
I told me brother shamus
I'll go off and get right famous
And when I return again
I'll have seen the whole world through

I called girls up in blarney
County Cork and in Kelarney
In passage and in Queenstown
And many the towns between
Goodbye to all mispleasure
For I'm off to take my leasure
And the next time you will hear from me
Will be a letter from New York

Well goodbye to the girls at home
I'm headin away across the foam
To try and make my fortune 
In far Ameri-kay
There's gold and jewels a plenty
For the poor and gentry
And the next time that you'll hear from me
I never more will say!
