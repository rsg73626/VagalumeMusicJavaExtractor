LOVER IN HELL

Gold trimmed... illusions
Running... down the drain
Flashes... of color
Running... down the drain
And we awake... stripped of our love
And we awake... stripped of our love
And we awake... stripped of our love
And we awake... stripped of our love
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to rise from the metropolis
Revel in rage
I won't care how conceited i became
And as i look out my window
Shame on the streets and below
All the cars, they are screaming
Hello we are we are the liars
And we lie for the men on t.v.
Hello we are we are the liars
And we lie for the men on t.v.
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to see i want to see what i know
I want to see i want to see what i know
