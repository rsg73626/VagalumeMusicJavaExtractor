PARALYZED

Paralyzed!
She's laying pretty in her
Gown
Clutching what remains
Of her ego
Terrorized!
She's trapped in a plastic
Bag
Waiting and craving for someone
To want her
Her eyes rolled into the
Back of her
Head
The lines of her features
Applied with
Incisions
The tractors went
Dragging right through
Her face
The structure of beauty
Had become her
Prison
