IDLE EYES

When you take off the disguise
I'll look into your eyes
Until then you will never see me
You were powerless to see honesty
I never remembered who to be
Peering eyes! bouquets of knives!
Have left me empty empty empty
Staring at your suctioned face
You give me nothing
Peering eyes! bouquets of knives!
Have left me empty empty empty
Staring at your suctioned face
You give me nothing!
I was laid out in the white sheets
I was a carcass in a field
I stood and waited for the heat
It wasn't me it wasn?t me
It wasn't...
