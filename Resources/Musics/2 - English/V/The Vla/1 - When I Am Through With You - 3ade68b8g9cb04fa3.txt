WHEN I AM THROUGH WITH YOU

Little lamb...

Smile!

When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
When I am thru with you.

Oh come back now where did you go?
No need to cower, don't know
If i can even turn your light on

Hello, Daisy, is that you 
Hiding in the grass?
I've come to pluck you, 
I'm gonna pluck you right in half.

When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
When I am thru with you.

I come to the city alone
I packed up my life and my home
'cause I feel like a body at rest
Is a life in Hell
So unpack my bags, unpack my bags
Kiss her on the mouth, and she says,
"Smile little lamb"

When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
When I am through with you,
I'm on to all you have left.
When I am through with you,
When I am through with you,
There won't be anything left.
