TEENAGE ICON

Oh look at me so ordinary
No mystery with no great capabilities
But I could make out as if I had it 
But you know
God I'm so obvious and I should let it go
Oh I don't know 
Oooh 

I'm no teenage icon 
I'm no Frankie Avalon 
I'm nobody's hero 
Oooh 

Reserved and shy your average guy 
No piercing stare 
Just out of shape with messy hair
But I always figured I was somebody 
And now I'm guessing that my moment must be late
'Cause I'm here 
Oooh 

I'm no teenage icon 
I'm no Frankie Avalon 
I'm nobody's hero 
Oooh 

I'm not magnetic or mythical
I'm suburban and typical 
But I got it I got it I'm overun with it all 

Seductive, charming way with words 
So effortless not leather clad or dangerous but 
I always did it like a real rebel would 
I had a photo which on Lennon may have stood 
So I'm told 
Oooh 

I'm no teenage icon 
I'm no Frankie Avalon 
I'm nobody's hero 
Oooh
