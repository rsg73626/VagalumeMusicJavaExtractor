WHY SHOULD I LOVE YOU

I am stuck here with a bottle of beer
And I love you
You have been gone with him far much too long
And I care

Why should I love you
As much as I do
I wanna sing
Why should I love you
Yeah uh huh alright come on

Nobody told me that you could be cold
So I loved you
Just how you talked to me, just how we walked
As a pair

Why should I love you
Now you're never true, I wanna sing
Why should I love you
Yeah uh huh alright come on

Every night of lies I wanna cry
Falling my friend
She won't compromise I wanna die
Suicide won't do, so

I'll go away so you can't hear me say
That I love you
Then you will see what it's like without me
In your hair

Why should I love you
As much as I do
I wanna sing
Why should I love you
Yeah uh huh alright come on

I'll go away so you can't hear me say
That I love you
Then you will see what it's like without me
In your hair

Why should I love you
As much as I do
I wanna sing
Why should I love you
Yeah uh huh alright come on
