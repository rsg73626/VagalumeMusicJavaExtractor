GOOD GUYS DON'T WEAR WHITE

I'm a bored boy born in the road
Some say my manners ain't the best
Some of my friends they've been in a whole lot of trouble
Some say I'm no better than the rest

But tell your mama and your papa
Sometimes good guys don't wear white

Everyday I work hard
At night I spend a restless time
With all those rich kids and their lazy money
You can't hold a candle too long

But tell your mama and your papa
Sometimes good guys don't wear white

Good guys bad guys which is which?
The white collar worker or digger in the ditch
Man who's to say who's the better man
Of those two I do the best I can

I'm a bored boy born in the road
Some say my manners ain't the best
Some of my friends they've been in a whole lot of trouble
Some say I'm no better than the rest

But tell your mama and your papa
Sometimes good guys don't wear white
