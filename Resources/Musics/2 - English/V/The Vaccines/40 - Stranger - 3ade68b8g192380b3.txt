STRANGER

I fall gently back into another world
If just to be reminded of an unfamiliar feeling
You think you know the truth
But it can be selective
Is lying so unkind?
Not from my perspective

And I'm doing the best that I can

It really don't matter
Call another stranger
If it don't matter
Call another stranger

Think of when I'm holding you and breaking from tradition
Phone photography and private exhibition
Is any of it real?
Just as I suspected
Difficult to read
But pretty unexpected

Are you doing the best that you can?
Yeah I'm doing the best that I can

It really don't matter
Call another stranger
If it don't matter
Call another stranger

Who told you?
What was I to you?
I'm sorry
We know that it's true

It really don't matter
Call another stranger
If it don't matter
Call another stranger
