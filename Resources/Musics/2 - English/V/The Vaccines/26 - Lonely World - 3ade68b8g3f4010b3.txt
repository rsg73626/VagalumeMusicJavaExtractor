LONELY WORLD

I knew where you were, it was perfectly obvious
I was uncomfortable playing it cool
And I feel like I have always known you
I can't recurse and I thought you had questioned it
Young in the night when we stare at the rest of it
Don't forget, Lord I know

I will hold you close
‘Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me to
‘Cause it is a lonely word

Well I put it off cause I'm painfully diffident
I played it out in my head from afar
But then trust me to go mess my mold up
You present her to my dissatisfaction
Oh what could have been with a little more time
Oh woes me, oh my God

I will hold you close
Because it is a lonely world
But would want me to
‘Cause it is a lonely world

Yeah, I will hold you close
‘Cause it is a lonely world
If I was confident
‘Cause it is a lonely world

I will hold you close
Because it is a lonely world
But would want me to
‘Cause it is a lonely world

Yeah, I will hold you close
‘Cause it is a lonely world
If I was confident
‘Cause it is a lonely world.
