MELODY CALLING

Oh I
How can I go on with it much further?
I didn't think that it would go any further
But now it has and it's making me nervous
A wonderful motion
That is turning in your every motion
Oh I
I think I might be losing my mind

Because when I hear a melody calling
Is your melody calling?
Isn't anyone calling?
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling

Oh I
I just did an undeniable order
I hear a choir of what I record
I hear it moving under the border
Cussing the ocean
And carrying in your every motion
I think I might be losing my mind

Because when I hear a melody calling
Is your melody calling?
Isn't anyone calling?
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling

When I hear a melody calling
Is your melody calling?
Isn't anyone calling?
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling

Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
Melody calling
