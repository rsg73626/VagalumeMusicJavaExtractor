PRIMAL URGES

Primal urges, animal urges
My appetite urges
Like a good fight urges

Primal urges, sexual urges
Those killer urges
Oh, I forgot what the word is

Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Pound for pound, it could be easy
But you got me wrong, you got me wrong
I got my primal urges
Primal urges, intimate urges
Irredeemable urges
But its never been worth it

A four head mountain wretches to close
Straight through the emperors new clothes
But I play along, I play along
I got my primal urges

Primal urges, animal urges
My appetite urges
Like a good fight urges

Primal urges, sexual urges
Those killer urges
Oh I forgot what the word is

Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Pound for pound, it could be easy
But you got me wrong, you got me wrong
I got my primal urges
