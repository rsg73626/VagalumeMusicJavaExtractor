NORGAARD

Great Dane's cheekbones
Teenage hormones
Young complexion
Non-physical affection
You're a god send
Do you want a boyfriend?
Crazy crazy, easy tiger

Her mind's made up, she don't want to go steady
She's only seventeen so she's probably not ready
A-m-a-n-d-a norgaard
I saw you on a cover on cross bay boulevard

Smaller tits
And skinny framework
Tall, sharp hips
And you're all in the same work
Giving me the sweet talk
Walking down the catwalk
I want a mannequin
But she won't let me in

Her mind's made up, she don't want to go steady
She's only seventeen so she's probably not ready
A-m-a-n-d-a norgaard
I saw you on a cover on cross bay boulevard

Her mind's made up, she don't want to go steady
She's only seventeen so she's probably not ready
A-m-a-n-d-a norgaard
I saw you on a cover on cross bay boulevard

Her mind's made up, she don't want to go steady
She's only seventeen so she's probably not ready
A-m-a-n-d-a norgaard
I saw you on a cover on cross bay boulevard
