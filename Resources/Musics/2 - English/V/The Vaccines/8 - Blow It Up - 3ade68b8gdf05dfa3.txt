BLOW IT UP

Okay, I could live without it,
Were you ever my age? No, I doubt it.
A native American feather;
But Generals look better in leather.

Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!

Shipping out his son on the weekend,
But you don't feel as young with a girlfriend,
I'm bored trying to deal with your ego,
Late light bagging in Willow.

Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow it up! Blow it up! ...

Guitar Solo

Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow, blow, blow it up!
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!
