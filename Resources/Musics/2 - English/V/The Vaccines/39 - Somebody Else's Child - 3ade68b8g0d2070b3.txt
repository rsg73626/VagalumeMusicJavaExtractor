SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILD

I'm alright
Why'd you ask?
I'm uptight, I guess
Let it pass
I've never had much in common with you

You brought me up
Gentle and mild
But I'm somebody else's
Somebody else's child

Full head of hair
Bright blue eyes
I get my nose, I'm told
From my mother's side
She took a lover that she barely knew

I let you down
Wayward and wild
But I'm somebody else's
Somebody else's child
