DREAM LOVER

Dream they call desire
Like it matters
It doesn't matter much to me
If I seem begrudging
Or on another planet
Actually

With a hollow embrace
Let's go back to your place
Uncover the lover
You cannot replace

When I shut my eyes
I got another dream lover
Somewhere in the dark
I got another dream lover

When you're on my mind
I kinda like it
Asleep, but for real
Think outside the box
Then anybody could have their appeal

With a hollow embrace
Let's go back to your place
Uncover the lover
You cannot replace

When I shut my eyes
I got another dream lover
Somewhere in the dark
I got another dream lover

Dreaming, dreaming, you're everywhere
Dream lover

With a hollow embrace
Let's go back to your place
Uncover the lover
You cannot replace

When I shut my eyes
I got another dream lover
Somewhere in the dark
I got another dream lover

Dreaming, dreaming, who could compare?
Dream lover
Dreaming, dreaming, you're everywhere
Dream lover
