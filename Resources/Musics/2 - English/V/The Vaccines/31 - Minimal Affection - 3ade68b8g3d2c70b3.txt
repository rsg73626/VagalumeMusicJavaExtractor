MINIMAL AFFECTION

In a world of minimal affection
Can you give yourself in a word
To a girl with a washed-out complexion
She's a mutual friend of mine
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone?
Is there anyone there?
You forget how to make a connection
And you've wanted one for so long

Moving on
You don't have a lot in common
When the world
If you don't even know my name

What is life if not for affection
Felt invisible, took too hard
Feddin' up in distraction
Is if everyone went away
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone?
Is there anyone there?
Fall back and into the quiet
Where I've wanted you for so long

Moving on
When you don't have a lot in common
When the world
If you don't even know my name

How am I supposed to hear you calling
If I can't hear a word you say?
How am I supposed to hear you calling
If I can't hear a word you say?

Moving on
You don't have a lot in common
When the world
If you don't even know my name

How am I supposed to hear you calling
If I can't hear a word you say?
How am I supposed to hear you calling
If I can't hear a word you say?
