WHERE IS MY MIND? (FEAT. NOAH AND THE WHALE)

Ooh

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it
Your head will collapse but there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it spinning?

I was swimming in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
But they told me this is where it's gonna talk to me honeybunny
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it spinning?

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse but there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it spinning?
