DENIAL

Take all the time that's on your side
But I am, I am, I am
I'm a man with pride
I know the world is in your hands
I do, I do, I do
And I understand
Oh I do, but do you?

Please don't turn the light out
I don't think the conversation's over
Just don't shut your eyes closed
Not until I get it off my chest

You know that I can hear you thinking
I've heard you all the way from here
But if I look you in the eye though
It's like your thoughts all disappear
I know you're looking for direction
And I know, I know, I know
I know where you wanna' go
Oh I do, but do you?

Please don't turn the light out
I don't think the conversation's over
Just don't shut your eyes closed
Not until I get it off my chest

Have you turned a corner?
Do you think of leaving me behind?

[?]
Oh I do

Please don't turn the light out
I don't think the conversation's over
Just don't shut your eyes closed
Not until I get it off my chest

Have you turned a corner?
Do you think of leaving me behind?
Please don't turn the light out
I don't think the conversation's over
