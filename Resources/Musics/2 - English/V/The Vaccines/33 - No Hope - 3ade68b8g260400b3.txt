NO HOPE

Oh I could bore you with the truth 
About an uneventful youth 
Or you could get that rap from someone else 
And I could make an observation 
If you are the voice of a generation 
But I'm too self absorbed to give it clout 

And I, I don't really care about 
Anybody else when I haven't got my whole life figured out 
Cause when you're young and bored and 24 
And you don't know who you are 
Nobody's 
No hope 
And it's hard to come of age 
I think it's a ṗroblem 
And it never goes my way 
And no, I am so self-obsessed 
I guess, but there's no hope 
But I hope it's just a phase 
Or I'll grow-oh-oh-oh 

Oh I could look for inspiration 
Find it in a trouble at English station 
but wouldn't that be cheap and ill-informed 
And I could bet you don't believe me 
If I said a cape from deep within me 
But I promise you I'm telling you the truth 

And I, I don't really care about 
Anybody else when I haven't got my whole life figured out 
Cause when you're 24 and young and bored 
And you don't know who you are 
Nobody's 
No hope 
And it's hard to come of age 
I think it's a problem 
And it never goes my way 
And no, I am so self-obsessed 
I guess, but there's no hope 
But I hope it's just a phase 
Or I'll grow 

Well I wish that I was comfortable in my own skin 
But the whole thing feels like an exercise 
And drank would be someone I would rather not be 
I'd try to second guess if you would be approving 
I find my life ever so moving 
Keen wide-eyed and unassuming 
No hoṗe 

There is no hope 
But there's desperately 
No hope, but there's definitely 
No hope if you don't believe me 
Oh, oh, oh 
And there is no hope 
But there's desperately 
No hope, but there's definitely 
No hope if you don't believe me 
Oh, oh, oh 

But I, I don't really care about 
Anybody else when I haven't got my whole life figured out 
Cause when you're 24 and young and bored 
And you don't know who you are 
Nobody's 
No hope 
And it's hard to come of age 
I think it's a problem 
And it never goes my way 
And no, I am so self-obsessed 
I guess, but there's no hope 
But I hope it's just a phase 
Or I'll grow-oh-oh-oh 

There is no hope 
And it never goes my way 
And no, I am so self-obsessed 
I guess, but there's no hope 
But I hope it's just a ṗhase 
Or I'll grow-oh-oh-oh
