MAKE YOU MINE

I can see now you've stepped into the light
You've got those bright kind of eyes that I like
I kinda lie and I can't find a way through
I've obscured my own view

Well I'd do anything to make you mine
Well I'd do anything to make you mine
Well I'd do anything to make it
make it seem like I am alright

I took my first steps walking on the wing
I've got a good mind and a fist full of string
I'm walking on the surface all up to my knees
I can't get no relief

Well I'd do anything to make you mine
Well I'd do anything to make you mine
Well I'd do anything to make it
make it seem like I am alright

All my, all my pretending makes me ache
One day I might persuade to take my foot off the break

Well I'd do anything to make you mine
Well I'd do anything to make you mine
Well I'd do anything to make it
make it seem like I am alright
