GIVE ME A SIGN

Would you blow me kisses
If I kept my distance?
Or would you send a hurricane
As proof of your existence? 
If I pick up speed 
Would it take me with you?
'Cause I wanna know for sure
Who you've been running into

You're so cold
But I am just hot air
With the weight of the world 
Coming down harder, harder

Just give me a sign
Give me a sign
Just give me a sign 
Give me a sign
Just give me a sign
Give me a sign
Baby, be kind
Give me a sign

When I lack conviction
And you're done convincing me
And I put my mind to rest
Would you go quietly?

You're so bad
I'm not a lot of good
With the weight of the world
Coming down harder, harder

Just give me a sign
Give me a sign
Just give me a sign 
Give me a sign
Just give me a sign
Give me a sign
I'm going in blind
Give me a sign

Coming down
Coming down
Coming down

Just give me a sign
Give me a sign
Just give me a sign 
Give me a sign
Throw me a line
It's because I'm
All outta time
Give me a sign

Give me a sign
