20/20

Served an ultimatum on a silver platter
I was on a plate but it doesn't matter
You can cut the cord on me but I got plenty
And hindsight sees in twenty-twenty

[?] love in the attic
Living in your shadow has been too dramatic
Tripping up on everything and double planning
Don't tell me you need reminding

I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
Oh I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

All we wanna do who who who who
who who who who
But I'm through
But I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

Could've been the power it's if heaven sent me
Fell into the echo of another memory
Call it negativity you're just distortion
Blow it up out of proportion

Through everything remembered from a new perspective
When I'm over-thinking I am too selective
So many are so lonely from another time oh
How I felt you'll never know

Cause I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
Oh I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

All we wanna do who who who who
who who who who
But I'm through
But I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

Served an ultimatum on a silver platter
I was on a plate but it doesn't matter
You can cut the cord on me but I got plenty
And hindsight sees in twenty-twenty

I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
Oh I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

All we wanna do who who who who
who who who who
But I'm through
But I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
