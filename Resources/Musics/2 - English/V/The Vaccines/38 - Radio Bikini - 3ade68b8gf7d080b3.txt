RADIO BIKINI

Return to bikini on time, to bikini
Return to bikini on time, to bikini
We have minds on the rush
Sandals and socks
Sentimentally sick
But you don't be ordering thick
Just bring me at the end
Don't you wanna see me?
I'm an European slut
Come on, come on, come on

Return to bikini on time, to bikini
Return to bikini on time, to bikini
We have minds on the fight
Commends to that in the booth
Should be loaded in sun
But not for everyone
Just bring me at the end
Don't you wanna see me?
I'm an European slut
Come on, come on, come on

Return to bikini on time, to bikini
Return to bikini on time, to bikini
We're minds on the run
Spend opportunities Ã¢? cause
Spend millions of hurry
Damn it nobody knows me
Just bring me at the end
Don't you wanna see me?
I'm an European slut
Come on, come on, come on
