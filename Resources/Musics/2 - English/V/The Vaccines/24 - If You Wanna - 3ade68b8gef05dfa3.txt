IF YOU WANNA

Well, I don't wanna wake up in the mornin',
But I've got to face the day.
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say.

I don't wanna do things independently,
But I can't make you stay.
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say.

But if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back ? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back to me!

Well, I don't wanna see you with another guy,
But the fact is that I may.
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say.

We'll give it just another couple of months or so,
And then you'll be okay.
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say.

All alone, all alone
I, I am on my own.
Alone, all alone.
I, I am on my own.

But if you wanna come back, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back to me

But if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? it's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back

Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back!
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back to me
