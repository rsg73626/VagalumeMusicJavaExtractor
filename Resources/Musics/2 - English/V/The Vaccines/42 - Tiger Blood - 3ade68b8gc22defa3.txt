TIGER BLOOD

You'd do it different but it's not up to you you have it easy but have nothing to do I am not convinced that I am doing it right just suck it up and say it's all been in spite you're moving in a different class drinking that wine from a brandy glass oh no

That's not to see we're doing it your way tiger blood
You fucked it up and thought I'd understand but I don't like what you are saying off hand

And when I went for you you bit me back good went in the corner like an animal would by playing on my biggest fear I watching you walk out of here it hurts

That's not to see we're doing it your way tiger blood

Who would've thought that you would be in it together one up on me it hurts

That's not to see we're doing it your way tiger blood
