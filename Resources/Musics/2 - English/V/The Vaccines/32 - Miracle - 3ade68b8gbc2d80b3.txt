MIRACLE

In a bar below and the radio
Hello hello hello
Or in a situation apropos
I know I know I know

But I don't wanna hurt you anymore

Double kiss and no bridge
But put the picture up on my fridge
I got high, took a blow
But if I had then how would you know

Cos I don't wanna hurt you anymore
Cos I don't wanna hurt you anymore

Does it have to be a miracle to find you?
Just gimme all your love I want it now
Does it have to be a miracle to remind you?
I don't wanna hurt you anymore

You're an electric fingered memory
I see I see I see
But if I let it go, it would come for me
I know I know I know
And I don't wanna hurt you anymore

Monolingual spraycan
What's a snowy mountain jian?
I got high, took a blow
But if I had then how would you know

Cos I don't wanna hurt you anymore
No I don't wanna hurt you anymore

Does it have to be a miracle to find you?
Just gimme all your love I want it now
Does it have to be a miracle to remind you?
I don't wanna hurt you anymore

Does it have to be a miracle to find you?
Just gimme all your love I want it now
Does it have to be a miracle or karma?
I don't wanna hurt you anymore
