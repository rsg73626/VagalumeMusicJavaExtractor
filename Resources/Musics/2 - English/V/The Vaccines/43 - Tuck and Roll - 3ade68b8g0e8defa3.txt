TUCK AND ROLL

What's bitching about tuck and roll?
Oh I hate being out of control
But you had to call all the shots
And you're high, when you're not, are you not?
Oh I'm grinding my teeth and I'm carving a much sharper jaw
It's just something new that I've never considered before
Oh where are you at? I'm dehydrated
Oh look at that, I wish we waited
I'm calling back who ever is calling
I made it up, but the truth is appalling

You said you gave up, but forgot
So is it appealing, or what?
Oh, ain't it a curious thing
When your finger's too fat for your ring?
Would you bee more happy, if life was just strait down a line
Maybe it's meant to be punishing them by design
Oh where are you at? I'm dehydrated
Oh look at that, I wish we waited
I'm calling back whoever is calling
I made it up but the truth is appalling

Oh where are you at? I'm dehydrated
Oh look at that I wish we waited
I'm calling back whoever is calling
I made it up but the truth is appalling

Oh where are you at? I'm dehydrated
Oh look at that I wish we waited
I'm calling back whoever is calling
I made it up but the truth is appalling
