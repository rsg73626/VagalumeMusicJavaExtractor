WRECKIN' BAR (RA RA RA)

Pretty girl, wreckin' bar,
Ra ra ra ra yeah you are!
Growin' up, I'm twice the man,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah I am!

The angels gave F. Scott Fitzgerald,
The evening news and the morning herald,
I know I'm from very far,
but I found the bastard by the car!

"Where you been?" you can say,
Hey hey hey hey yeah you may!
That might seem a bit below?
No no no it's funny though!

Let's go home I think we oughta,
I know you're your Mother's daughter,
Well brought up; royal blue,
I haven't got the time for you!

Guitar Solo

English boy named, presupposing,
Watch out, man, that door's a-closing,
This is what you get when you turn your back,
A clear blue sky turning dirty black
