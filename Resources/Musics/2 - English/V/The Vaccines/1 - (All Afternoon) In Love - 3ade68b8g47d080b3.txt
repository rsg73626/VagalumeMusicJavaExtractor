(ALL AFTERNOON) IN LOVE

Oh don't be unkind
I'm trying to listen to you
I thought that you wanted me too
But it's kind of difficult to do

Hey don't know it though
We're at the end of the line
And I might be end of my wins
But I guess that everything fixed

But I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love

You thought it over
Over and over again
And now you're walking away
And now you're walking away

Now that you're older
Now that it's all in the past
I want it all afternoon
But I hope that I'll see you soon

Cause I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love
