I CAN'T QUIT

Hangin' around, hittin' the ground
Dead in the water
Suckin' it up, fuckin' it up
With a favourite daughter
Take the swing, everything
Around in circles
Takin' a hit, this is it
I'm over it

I can't quit
I'm over it

Shootin' it up, cuttin' up
With broken glasses
Have a beat, been loving in love
I've been in the classes
Get your man
And go to work out with your sister
Talkin' about brother's fame
I'm over it

I can't quit
I'm over it
I can't quit
I'm over it

You can't change me, can you?
You can't offer that much to me
Oh you can't offer change, can you?
And I can't offer that much to you

Havin' it out, livin' in doubt
But no defenses
Tighten the rope, and talkin' to hope
In different tenses
Callin' my friends and tellin'
The only one that answers
It's hard to make brother sick
I'm over it

I can't quit
I'm over it
(I'm so dramatic)
I can't quit
(I'm so dramatic)

You can't change me, can you?
You can't offer that much to me
Oh you can't offer change, can you?
And I can't offer that much to you

I can't quit
(I'm so dramatic)
I'm over it
(Hangin' around, over the ground
Dirt in my bracelet)
I can't quit
(Suckin' it up, fuckin' it up
With your replacement)
I'm over it
(Time to swing, everything
Around a circle)
I can't quit
(Takin' a hit, brother said)
I'm over it
