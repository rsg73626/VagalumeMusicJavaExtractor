WANT YOU SO BAD

Quicken up
Come on bite the hand that feeds you
It's what I do
But you know somebody needs you

Oh how does it feel?
Oh how does it feel?

To want you so bad
Want you so bad
Oh I want you so bad
No care for what I've got or what I have
Cause I want you want you so bad

Moving on
Your abandon is so casual
Suggestive
It's just so hard for me to handle
Oh breast stroke in after-shave ocean
Get our petrol in motion
Shaking your head in dissatisfaction
Living in hope for the best reaction

Oh just like before
Oh who wanted more?

I want you so bad
Want you so bad
Oh I want you so bad
No care for what I've got or what I have
Cause I want you want you so bad

I want you so bad
Want you so bad
Oh I want you so bad
No care for what I've got or what I have
Cause I want you want you so bad
