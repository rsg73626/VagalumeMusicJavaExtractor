UNDER YOUR THUMB

Hanging out some
Underneath European sun
Hanging out under your thumb
Under it, second to none

I don't mind about taking it slow
I’m perfectly aware of what I’m yet to know
Mutually assumed, utterly consumed
Totally adored, Eleanor
Eleanor

Eleanor

Take it in your stride but don't string me along
I wouldn't tie you down but if you did do me wrong
Thoroughly unnerved, equally perturbed
Totally adored, Eleanor
Eleanor

Eleanor

Eleanor
