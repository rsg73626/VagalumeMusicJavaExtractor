DO YOU WANT A MAN?

If I go out on a limb
And if I wait a little longer
If I held you to your word
Then where would I be?
If I looked a little closer
What would I see?

I'm just asking 'cause I wanted to know
Where you're going, going, going, go-oh-oh, go

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your ma-a-a-a-a-a-aa-aan

If you keep me in the dark
Keep me waiting on an exit
And if I look like I am crazy
Then you'll know for who

I'll just go around in circles
And revolve around you
I'm just saying 'cause I wanted to know
Where you're going, going, going, go-oh-oh, go

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your ma-a-a-a-a-a-aa-aan

Well it's time to let me know
'Cause I asked you a while ago
Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?

How could I keep it on the low?
We're taking it slow
And if you never had a go
Then how did you know?

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your man

Do you want a man?
Do you want a man?
I could be your ma-a-a-a-a-a-aa

a-a-a-a-a-aa-aa
a-a-a-a-a-aa-aa
a-a-a-a-a-aa-aa
