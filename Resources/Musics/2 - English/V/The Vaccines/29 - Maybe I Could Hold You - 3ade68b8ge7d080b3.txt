MAYBE I COULD HOLD YOU

If he was man enough
And if I thought you'd cared for
Is being comfortable
If you had asked around
And if you'd found me there
Would it bother you?
I told you what you wanna hear

I don't know who I thought you were
But no one ever made you wonder
And it's getting to the point where I'm gonna have to ask if

Maybe I could hold you
(I don't want your loving)
(Idon't want a lot to lose)
(But I could be your reason)
(If you want someone to use)

When you came to me
It's not as if I kept you
I wasn't looking to
What is history?
And what is in the future
Does it matter now?
I'm not convinced it does to you

I don't know who I thought you were
But no one ever made you wonder
And it's getting to the point where I'm gonna have to ask if 

Maybe I could hold you
(I dont want your loving)
(I dont want a lot to lose)
(But I could be your reason)
(If you want someone to use)
(I don't want the trouble)
(I dont want a lot to lose)
(But I could be whatever helps you)
(If you want someone to use)

Maybe I could hold you 
(I don't want your loving)
(I dont want a lot to lose)
(But I could be your reason)
(If you want someone to use)
(I don't want the trouble)
(I dont want a lot to lose)
(But I could be whatever helps you)
(If you want someone to use)
(I could be the cover)
(doesnt really matter whose)
(and maybe only an occasion)
(when you want someone to use).
