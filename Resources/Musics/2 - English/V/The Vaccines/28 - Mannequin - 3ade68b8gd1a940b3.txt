MANNEQUIN

Shalalalalalalala
Shalalalalalalala, oh

You're a waste of space
No natural grace
You're so bloody thin
And you don't even begin

To interest me
Not even curiousity
It's not animosity
You just don't interest me

You're an energy void
A black hole to avoid
No style, no heart
You don't even start

To interest me
Not even curiousity
It's not animosity
It's just you don't interest me

Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?

Shalalalalalalala, oh
Shalalalalalalala, oh
Shalalalalalalala, oh

Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?

Shalalalalalalala, oh
Shalalalalalalala, oh
Shalalalalalalala, oh

Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
