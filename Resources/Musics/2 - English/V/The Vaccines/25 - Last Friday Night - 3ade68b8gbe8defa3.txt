LAST FRIDAY NIGHT

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
Dj's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
There's a hickie or a bruise

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a black top blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled

Last Friday night
We danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
We maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
We maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bars
So we hit the boulevards
Last Friday night

This Friday night
This Friday night

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Last Friday night
We danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
We maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Oh-whoa-oh
Last Friday night
This Friday night
This Friday night
