ENGLISH GRAFFITI

Inca Kola
A Chinese lunch
Instant karma for overpriced brunch
Copacabana and coconut punch
English Graffiti on every wall
The more defiant, the harder I fall
But you'll make a fool out of me after all

I am living in a world that's half the size
when I look in your eyes
That would melt away
If only you would stay
That makes no sound whenever you're around

Tip it all over and everything loose
Push me away you just tighten the noose
But you hang up on some hollow excuse
When conversation just comes back around
And if on occasion I chew off your ear
It's just cause you tell me what I wanna hear

I am living in a world that's half the size
when I look in your eyes
That would melt away
If only you would stay
That makes no sound whenever you're around

Where in the world anyway
Right under my nose
So close

I am living in a world that's half the size
when I look in your eyes
That would melt away
If only you would stay
That makes no sound whenever you're around

I've seen the world now
It all looked alike
I gave it some time
But I still feel the same
I listened intently but just hear your name
