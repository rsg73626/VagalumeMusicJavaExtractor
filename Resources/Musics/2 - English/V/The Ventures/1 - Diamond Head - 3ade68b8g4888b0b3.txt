DIAMOND HEAD

Tell me, why you keep foolin' little coquette?
Makin' fun of the one who love you
Breakin' hearts you're rulin' little coquette
True hearts tenderly dreamin' of you

Oh, oh someday you'll fall in love
as I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love will just be foolin'
And when you are alone with only regrets
You know, little coquette I love you

Oh, oh someday you'll fall in love
as I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love will just be foolin'
And when you are alone with only regrets
You know, little coquette I love you
