THE KING'S VOYAGE

The king rides on the waves
With sails full of wind
With the stars behind us
A thousand warriors aboard
With shining swords in their hands
And war on their minds

In the distance
They saw land
Who are they?
He raised his hand

That's the signal
The end is near
Get to shore
We face them here

And as the king
Looked over the land
The warriors fell to the ground
He roams the fields all alone
Not a soul to be found

On this island I'm alone
I miss my home
I can't find no shelter

The cold nights never seem to
Take an end
Under the skies
I rest my eyes
My heartbeat fades away
I'm going home
