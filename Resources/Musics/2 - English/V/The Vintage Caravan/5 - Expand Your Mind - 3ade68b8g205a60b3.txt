EXPAND YOUR MIND

Expand your mind, baby
Take a look behind
Take a trip with me, take a trip
Sail into the endless sea
Sail away with me
Take a trip with me, take a trip

Take a look into my eyes
What they told you were all lies
Take a trip with me, take a trip
Colors blend from the moon
Voices whisper, look at the loon
Take a trip with me, take a trip

Your mind
Full of questions, honey
You will find, you will know
The answer lies within your heart now baby
You will find, you will

They're not gonna give you anything
They don't want you to know
So take a trip with us, take it

Your mind
Full of questions, honey
You will find, you will know
The answer lies within your heart now baby
You will find, you will know

Expand your mind, baby
Take a look behind
Take a trip with me, take a trip
Sail into the endless sea
Sail away with me
Take a trip with me, take a trip

Your mind
Full of questions, honey
You will find, you will know
The answer lies within your heart now baby
You will find, you will
