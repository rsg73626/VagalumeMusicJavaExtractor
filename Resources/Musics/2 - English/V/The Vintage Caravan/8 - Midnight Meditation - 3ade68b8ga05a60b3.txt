MIDNIGHT MEDITATION

The sun is setting
And the moon is here
I felt her presence
In the atmosphere
As I sat on the ground
There was no one around
I felt like I - was fading away

Midnight meditation
Now I see, now I see
Midnight, midnight
Midnight meditation

I found the key
To the answer I need
What once was abstract
Now is clear
The night did - surround me
My voice echoed
In a distant dream

Midnight meditation
Now I see, now I see
Midnight, midnight
Midnight meditation

The stars lit up the sky
Right in front of my eyes
The universe
Asked me to take it's hand
I was united - with everything
Forever midnight meditation

Midnight meditation
Now I see, now I see
Midnight, midnight
Midnight meditation
