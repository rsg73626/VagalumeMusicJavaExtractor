M.A.R.S.W.A.T.T

I went down
Into the center of the town
To my surprise
I saw the starship enterprise
I screamed and shout
And all the people jumped about
I saw the purple eyes
Fade away

Come on over to my place
And take the roundabout
You've got the stuff I need
Please won't you give it to me

That bird has flown
And now I'm moping all alone
She moaned and moaned
And she said "baby, take me home"
I said "look now, honey
You aren't going nowhere"
I saw your purple eyes
Fade away

Come on over to my place
And take the roundabout
You've got the stuff I need
Please won't you give it to me
