CRAVING

Hey now, mama
Listen to what I say
We got a good thing
We got a good thing going on
That's for sure
Don't let it die out
Don't let it die out or go away

Your voice is sweet
And you mean so much to me
When I get to taste your lips
It can't be beat
I love you and that's the way
It's gonna stay

I'm craving in the night
I'm craving and it's out of sight
I'm craving you
You're the one I crave

When my mind is full of worry
I come running to you in a hurry

I'm craving in the night
I'm craving and it's out of sight
I'm craving you
You're the one I crave

You said we shouldn't waste our time
If we're happy
We shouldn't mind
We're great together
Like rock and leather
