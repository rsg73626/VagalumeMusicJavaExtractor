COCAINE SALLY

The cold winter winds blow
While sally sells her body in the night
Her life she is ruining
She doesn't care if it isn't right
Hoping this is all a bad dream
Hoping nothins is as it seems
Doesn't have a place to call home
In this world she is all alone

Cocaine sally
Wanders the streets alone
Cocaine sally
Doesn't have a home
AAh aah aah aah yeah

One night she had one too much
All alone in the streets
That night she had a strangers touch
So cold, so cold
So damn cold
She couldn't feel her feet
She went right back to sleep
The lost soul never
Came back

Cocaine sally
Wanders the streets alone
Cocaine sally
Doesn't have a home
AAh aah aah aah yeah
