DO YOU REMEMBER

Do you remember
When we used to listen
To simon and garfunkel
In the night
In your hometown
We were all alone
With flowers on your wall
That watched our every move
Those days are gone
I don't know where we stand

We lived many miles apart
The wait drove us mad
We talked abour the future
How sweet it would be
You living so close to me
Those days are real
I see you everyday
Somehow you could not see
Yourself with me

Letting go
Getting used to life without you
I can't stop thinking that
Things would be like they used to be
Laughter, love and joy
The way it should always be
