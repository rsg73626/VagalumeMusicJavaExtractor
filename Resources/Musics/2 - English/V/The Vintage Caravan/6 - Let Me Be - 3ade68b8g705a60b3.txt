LET ME BE

All I want
All I need
Just a little time for me
A little peace of mind
Leave the world behind
Leave the world behind

It would be alright
If you weren't by my side
I don't want your boundaries
Limits or rules
I don't need no one
I don't need you
I can't stand the sight of you

I don't need no one by my, by my side
All I need is my guitar and I'll be alright
I don't need no one by my, by my side

I don't care if you think
What I'm doing is right or wrong
I'll keep walking my path
I won't stop
So let me be
Yeah, let me be
I'll make you understand
I'm not your lover man

All I want, yeah, all I need
Is just a little time for me
A little peace of mind
Leave the world behind
Leave the world behind

I don't need no one by my, by my side
All I need is my guitar and I'll be alright
I don't need no one by my, by my side
