PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOM MAN

You told me that the pyramid was too high to climb
You told me I would have to travel across time
So I looked up beyond the skies and into space
Rise up from the city lights

I see a man dressed as a mushroom
Dancing like a rabbit
Talking backwards too
His green eyes gave away toxic colorful fume

Psychedelic mushroom man
Fighting back in Vietnam
With spirits and ghost's trapped in a can
Psychedelic mushroom man

People say that I am out of my head
But I'm gonna prove them wrong
Climb high upon my balcony
Spread my wings and fly
Yeah fly away
