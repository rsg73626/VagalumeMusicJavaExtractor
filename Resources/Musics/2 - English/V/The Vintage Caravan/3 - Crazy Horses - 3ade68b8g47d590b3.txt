CRAZY HORSES

Rise and shine
I think I blew a fuse
Covered in ants and completely confused
A broken nose
And mouth full of snus
In a foreign land
Total gibberish, I can't understand

They say I danced with the Crazy Horses
They say I burned a man's house to the ground
It don't feel right
But tonight I wanna do it again
They said I passed out in the Holy Water
They said I fought with a Great White Shark
It don't feel right
But tonight I wanna do it again

Oh no! This can't be undone
I can't get home
No wallet, no phone
What's that scar?
Did I push you too far?
Puking in a bath
I think my kidneys are gone
Exile from here
I silenced my fear

They say I danced with the Crazy Horses
They say I burned a man's house to the ground
It don't feel right
But tonight I wanna do it again
They said I passed out in the Holy Water
They said I fought with a Great White Shark
It don't feel right
But tonight I wanna do it again

I'll get arrested in a nurse outfit
Throw the faces in the morning breeze
It sure feels right
Tomorrow I'll do it again
I'm gonna stop aliens from ivading
Ride a rocket right into the sun
It sure feels right
Tomorrow I'll do it again!
