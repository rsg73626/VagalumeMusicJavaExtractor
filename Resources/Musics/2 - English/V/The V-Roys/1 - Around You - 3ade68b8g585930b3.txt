AROUND YOU

I'm going to be alright
Standing here inside your light
Spend each and every night around you
I'm gonna be just fine

Watchin out for what is mine
Find a way to spend my time around you

Refr√£o
But if you want to play it cool that's fine
That wasn't how you were last night
When your shoes were outside my door
And I've been waiting such a long long time
Your word is just as good as mine
You promised you would let him go

I'm gonna sit right here
And listen to you call him dear
I wonder how you pull him near aroundyou
I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright around you
(around you)
