SHE

She, she's a gun
She, she's a fun
She, she's a scar
She, she has to die

In your mind
She is a fire
And your soul
She's control
You not understand
Maybe I know
I'll fucking die
You dont know

She, she's so cool 
She, she's a fool
She, she's a married
She, she's a strawberry

In my mind
She is a fire
And my soul
She's control
You do not understand
Maybe I know
I'll fucking die
I don't fucking know

In my mind
She is a fire
And my soul
She's control
You do not understand
Maybe I know
I'll fucking die
I know
