I WISH FOR THIS (TIME TO REST)

In my every single past
I can't only rest
And wait for another door
Hum, I wish other tears
So really disappear
And move all the breath before

Behind and across the line
I feel the moment and time
And maybe you can see along 
I hear the silence feel's
So maybe it's not real
Inside this heart of pearl
I wish our dear rest before

And now
I go
To high
This cold
And how
You feel
So great 
I know

In my every single past
I can't, only time to rest
I wish for this to breath before
And move all that all hope is gone

I wish for this 
Time to rest
