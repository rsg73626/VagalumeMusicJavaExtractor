STAY AWAY

Face to face
I hear
Chase away
It's not survive
I'm late 
And you say
"don't fear"
But I can change
For you this night

And stay, stay away from here

Don't fake
Your mistake
His silence fine
I maybe fly
And your misery
Your punish
And my destiny
Not's what we are!

And stay, stay away from here
She said, stay away...
