YOU DID NOT WAIT FOR US

Someone bother with your face
Left behind into your eyes
There's no control
Many people cant you go
And stay away

And now and all for free?
And as the gates closed up for me
And you did not wait for us
Go away, belong to past

Someone killer 
Took his soul
And went further than any one
Dont go away
Close your eyes and listen to your heart
And start again

And now and all for free?
And as the gates closed up for me
And you did not wait for us
Go away, belong to past

I can't try again
I can't lie again

And now and all for free?
And as the gates closed up for me
And you did not wait for us
Go away, belong to past
