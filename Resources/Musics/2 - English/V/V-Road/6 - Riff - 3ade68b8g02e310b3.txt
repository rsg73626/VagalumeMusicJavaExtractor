RIFF

Real deal
That's ok
There's not exist
I'm a free man

I'm the fish
You are the hook
There's no future
You got dammit luck

And my hands high in the sky
Holding what is capable
Straight to the line
Very nice

I'm back
Are you ok?
Then take this
And turn off the lights

And my hands high in the sky
Holding what is capable
Straight to the line
Very nice
