CHANGE TO BETTER

Of my cloud I spy the night
From everywhere
Waiting for a chance to talk
With you while you sleep
I decide
Stand
From behind the door
Give me one chance to maybe say

I can make your face
Change to better

In this night 
I believe
Everything can improve
If we can just maybe try
This time 
The warning
Was getting closer
If we can just maybe try

Of my cloud I see your smile
So beautiful
Waiting for me from other side
Why not get closer
If I can just hug you
And morning with you
Give me one chace to maybe say

In my heart
I keep a star
Your star
And most of the time
I hold my breath
Is so hard
