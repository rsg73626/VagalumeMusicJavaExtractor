SURVIVE

Everything tries simmer down
Everything is cold deep down
Every smile is so distant
Look around
I'm lost
I will not be found
I'm great
I regret

In this time will we not survive

You are fool
She's so mood
He's stupid
We are cool
I'm lost
I'm not be found
I'm great
I regret

In this time will we not survive
