BLACK AND BLUE

What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?
Why can't we make love not war?
You beat my heart until you made it
Black and blue
Black and blue
Made it
Black and blue
Black and blue

Whoever thought our love turn domestic?
I've finally had enough
I won't accept it
I can't let you put your hands on me
Be damned if I turned the other cheek

What are we fighting for?
Why can't we make love not war?
You beat my heart until you made it
Black and blue
Made it
Black and blue

All our sticks and stones
Only turn into more
Now we have to go
And cover up another scar
We did more damage than we had
One of us gon end up in jail
And it won't be me

What are we fighting for?
Why can't we make love not war?
You beat my heart until you made it
Black and blue
Made it
Black and blue
