GO

Shut up, shut up
Shut up while you're talking to me
I said shut up, shut up
If you wanna go baby, then leave
I said shut up, shut up
Shut up while you're talking to me
Shut up, shut up
If you wanna go baby, then leave

Said I cannot fathom how often that we
Go, go back and forth like a damn factory
You, you know you won't cause you know what you did
I, I will not put up with none of this no more
[pre-chorus]
I, I'mma be rolling, cruising like a motherfucker
Tell my nigga k dot, I'm bad
Mercialgo, how I be stunting on these chickens
And they daughters and they sisters huh
I said it
Don't you get it twisted cause
You know I'm 'bout my business
But I'mma be chilling
So don't worry about me baby
Just hand over the keys

If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
Just leave me
If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
You should just leave me
Who you gonna love? who you gonna be
Without me?
If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
Then baby, just leave me yeah
Whatever you gotta do
Whatever you gotta do
Just go, just do what you gotta do
Whatever you gotta do

Lately I been working hard shifts, late nights
Everything heading off
And all my queens paid up, make it
Don't y'all think it's time for you girls
To go and have another round?

I, I'mma be rolling, cruising like a motherfucker
Tell my nigga k dot, I'm bad
Mercialgo, how I be stunting on these chickens
And they daughters and they sisters huh
I said it
Don't you get it twisted cause
You know I'm 'bout my business
But I'mma be chilling
So don't worry about me baby
Just hand over the keys

If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
Just leave me
If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
You should just leave me
Who you gonna love? who you gonna be
Without me?
If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
Then baby, just leave me yeah
Whatever you gotta do
Whatever you gotta do
Just go, just do what you gotta do
Whatever you gotta do

You can never live without it
You know you can't live without it
Baby don't you love it
How it feel now you ain't got it?
I'mma make you write a song about it
On me yeah
Ask me where the love go
Acting like you don't know
I know you miss it
Why don't you miss it?
Go, you should just go
Why don't you go?
Why don't you go?
You should just go
Why don't you go?
Why don't you go?
Go

If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
Just leave me
If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
You should just leave me
Who you gonna love? who you gonna be
Without me?
If you wanna go, if you wanna leave
Then baby, just leave me yeah
Whatever you gotta do
Whatever you gotta do
Just go, just do what you gotta do
Whatever you gotta do
