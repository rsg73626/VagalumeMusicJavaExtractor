SMILE (FEAT. TIMBALAND)

Through the rain or shine
I'll be there when you call me
(There when you call me)
You're my favorite song that I sing in the morning
You're the cream to my coffee
You're the sound of my heart beat
Baby you're that winner
Can't lose cause I got that winner
Can't lose if I got you here

Ooh
I would climb the moon
Any day that you ask me
Need no parachute
Cause your loves gonna catch me
If you're there then I'm happy
If you're not then I'm crappy
You make everything better
When it pours baby you're my umbrella
Even on my worst day

I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile
Yeah, I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
So let me turn that frown upside down
Let's just toast to love that we found, yeah
Cause I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile

Ooh
When the chips are down
I'd bid you all that I got
With your poker face
We can still hit the jackpot
Then we ball 'til we cash out
Then we ball 'til we cash out
I ain't leaving you never
I ain't lea-lea-leaving you never, never

Oh when I need a lift baby
You never let me down
And when I fall off you put me right back together now
Put me right back together now
Put me right back together now
I ain't leaving you never
I ain't lea-lea-leaving you never
Even on my worst day

I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile
Yeah, I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
So let me turn that frown upside down
Let's just toast to love that we found, yeah
Cause I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile

When I see you smile
When I see you smile
See you smile (come on y'all)
When I see you smile (everybody out there)
When I see you smile (just clap your hands
Let me hear you say)

When I see you smile (if you got something to smile about)
When I see you smile (put your hands up in the air)
When I see you smile (put your hands up in the air
Let me hear you say)

When I see you smile
When I see you smile
See you smile (put your hands up in the air)
When I see you smile (put your hands up in the air
In the air, let me hear you say)

When I see you smile
When I see you smile
See you smile
When I see you smile
When I see you smile
