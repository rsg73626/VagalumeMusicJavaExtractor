EVERYTHING ELSE

No one can change
What I have done
All that I take is what I want
Everything else in the world I don't get it

Their way of life is absurd and pathetic
I'm holdin on to the sound and I mean it
Everything else in the world I don't get it

Now, everyday, stay in control
Though I'm estranged
Its all I know I know it all, what I can I say?
I know it all, don't bother me
