OUT THE LOOP

She got my heart
Deranged by love
Still I'm vacant
Alone wasted

Out of the loop again
You're gonna lose a friend
Nothin' to do so get out of the loop

Trip through twilight
See out of sight
He don't show it
Now I'm goin'

Out of the loop again
You're gonna lose a friend
Nothin' to do so get out of the loop
Out the loop
