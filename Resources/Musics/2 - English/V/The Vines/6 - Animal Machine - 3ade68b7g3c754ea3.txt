ANIMAL MACHINE

I'm lookin' down by the streets end
Girl you've been lacking a pretense
So save your money for the weak you're gonna kill
'Cause I got something that the company know how to feel

I'm lookin' down by the streets end
Girl you've been lacking a pretense

There can't be anything between
It's automatic over me
Shoot like an animal machine
Straight from the colours of her dream
Colours of her dream

I'm lookin' over the deep end
Time ain't a reason or defense
FLY from a tree to a seabed
Meanwhile, you'll be locked in a freezer

There can't be anything between
It's automatic over me
Shoot like an animal machine
Straight from the colors of her dream
Colors of her dream
Shoot like an animal machine 
Straight from the colors of her dream
Straight from the colors of her dream
Colors of her dream (x4)
