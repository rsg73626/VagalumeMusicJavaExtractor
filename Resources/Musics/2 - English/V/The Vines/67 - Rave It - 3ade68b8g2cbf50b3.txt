RAVE IT

It ain't a miracle to say the cynical
Ain't nothin' mystical here today
But if you look around here come another sound
Right from the underground, now I pray
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Try it again
Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Hear what I said

Rave it, baby
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Rave it, baby
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah

When I was growin up and takin' every drug
Could never get enough anyway
But then I figured out what it was all about
The ones that really count now I pray
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Try it again
Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Now, c'mon get up
Hear what I said

Rave it, baby
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Rave it, baby
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
