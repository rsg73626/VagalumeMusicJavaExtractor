RIDE

Ahhh 

That's the start, the middle, and the end 
Aren't you glad the universe pretend 
If I don't get this message honed 
Once again, I'm gonna hate alone 

Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me home 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me unless you 

Bored aloud, ignore the right to be 
Invite me down because we like to see 
The colours through your loaded mind 
Fuck the world and liberate our time 

Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me home 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me ohhhh 

I'm not waiting a long life 
I'm not waiting alone 

Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me home 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me home
