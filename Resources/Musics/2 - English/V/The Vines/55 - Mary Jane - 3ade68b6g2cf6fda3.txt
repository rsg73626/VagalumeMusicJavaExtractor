MARY JANE

Mary Jane said life's a wait 
I already knew 
Because we're down 
We'll lose the town 
Just like I would choose 

Mary Jane said minds are games 
I went to the moon 
Before we know 
She'll have to go 
Wish I were there too 
But I've got to go 

Mary Jane [x8]

Mary says 
I, I can love you 
Life's a wait 
Why, why should I lose 
When I've got to go 

Mary Jane [x9]
