GET OUT

Find a way out
Get what you can
Keep your head now
Listen when I sing

C'mon get out. Outta here
C'mon get out. Over me
C'mon get out
God don't need ya oooooh

Find a home now (A home now)
See where you get (where you get)
Sleep alone now (Alone now)
Or making a friend

C'mon get out. Outta here
C'mon get out. Over me
C'mon get out
God don't need ya oooooh

I know your thinking 'bout yourself (About yourself)
Why would you think of no one else? (Of no one else?)
I'll keep on moving with the sound (Vin with the sound)
And sure do hope you come around Oh Oh Oh Oh

C'mon get out. Outta here
C'mon get out. Over me
C'mon get out
God don't need ya oooooh
