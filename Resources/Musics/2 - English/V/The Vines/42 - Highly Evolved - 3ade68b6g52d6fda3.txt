HIGHLY EVOLVED

I´m felling happy
So highly evolved
My times´s a riddle that´ll never be solved
Dreamin for somethin
Reachin for somethin
Just waitin for the sun to carry me in

If you felling low
You can buy love
From a pay phone
I don´t feel low

My brother Bill
He work for the market
Life is an arrow now and he is the target
Dreamin for somethin
Reachin for somethin
Just waitin for the sun to carry me in

If you felling low
You can buy love
From a pay phone
I don´t feel low

Highly Evolved 
Highly Evolved 
Highly Evolved 
Highly Evolved 

I don´t  feel low
Highly Evolved
