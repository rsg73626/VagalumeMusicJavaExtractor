A GIRL I KNEW

Allie was a girl I knew
Took my heart and tore it in two
There are things I couldn't say
There are times I feel ashamed
Marriage was a thing we had
Hurt so much that it made me mad
Livin off of coke and brew
So much time to sit and lose

You say you want a reason
I belong to you
The winner of the season
They tell you where to move

That day she walked out the door
Cried so much on the kitchen floor
Wishin I could have her back
Feelin like a heart attack

You say you want a reason
I belong to you
The winner of the season
They tell you where to move

New letter on the telephone
Record deal and a movie role
Tellin me it's all ok
Wants to meet and speak again
Oh yeah
