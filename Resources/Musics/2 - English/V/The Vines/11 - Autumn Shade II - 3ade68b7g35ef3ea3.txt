AUTUMN SHADE II

Look through me because I am transparent
Ought to know me but why even know yourself
I'm beginning to need all that I can't have
I'm succeeding to speak like I'm fucking mad 
Looking at the autumn shade
You are white and I am grey
Looking at the autumn shade, oh yeah 

Look through me because I am transparent
Ought to know me but why even know yourself
I'm beginning to need all that I can't have
I'm succeeding to speak like I'm fucking mad 

Looking at the autumn shade
You are white and I am grey
Looking at the autumn shade, oh yeah 

Oh.â€¦
