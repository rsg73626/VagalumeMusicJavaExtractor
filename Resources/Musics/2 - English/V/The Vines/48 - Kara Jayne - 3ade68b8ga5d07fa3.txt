KARA JAYNE

Oh baby girl,
I wanna see you night and day
and in my world
I hope nothing will ever change
before you go
I've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting

Oh baby girl
I wanna ride into the sun
and in my world
try take a shot at everyone
Before you go
I've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting

You should know
I've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting

[ Oh baby girl, Oh baby girl, I love you ]
