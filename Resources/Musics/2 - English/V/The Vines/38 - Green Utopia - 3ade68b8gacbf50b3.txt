GREEN UTOPIA

Do ya wanna (do ya wanna)
Hit the gutter? (hit the gutter)
Little lover say you love me
But the city (but the city)
Is a pity (is a pity)
There's a pretty way it can be

Baby turn around (yea-eah)
Under silver cloud (yea-eah)
See the mystic sun (shine on)
Green utopia (my love)
Green, green utopia

Do ya wanna (do ya wanna)
Smoke another? (smoke another)
In a leather make my hear beat
But the people (but the people)
Pretty evil (pretty evil)
There's a real place that I need

Baby turn around (yea-eah)
Under silver cloud (yea-eah)
See the mystic sun (shine on)
Green utopia (my love)

I don't need what I never got
I believe anything I want
Follow me through another world
Evergreen let the city burn

Baby turn around (yea-eah)
Under silver cloud (yea-eah)
See the mystic sun (shine on)
Green utopia (my love)
Green, green utopia
