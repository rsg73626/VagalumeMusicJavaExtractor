DON'T GO

Taking everything I see
Walking on the ground I've been
Waiting for the day to start
Cause something's got me all alone 
Oh no don't go
Throw away undo it play the bass
I know if she'd gone
Wanna be left on this place now 

Take the weight up off your mind
Dreaming for the seventh time
If we wake now we'll believe 
Either way it's fun to dream 

Oh no don't go
Throw away undo it play the bass
I know but she'd done
Gonna be left on this place now
