LANDSLIDE

Landslide

Straight from the heart 
To buy, you look like nothing's up 
Where the air labours your mind 
You look the part 
Too bad I'm nothin' ever too 
Where the air labours you're mind 
Who are we? 
To bring the fire down 
Who are we supposed to please 
When you're friggin' round 
All of me 
To something that I say 
For your fire, yeah that sounds great 
And I got a friend.... 
It's whatever you wanna be 
Now, you're alone and it's up to me 
You get to be 
More strung out than you thought you'd be.
