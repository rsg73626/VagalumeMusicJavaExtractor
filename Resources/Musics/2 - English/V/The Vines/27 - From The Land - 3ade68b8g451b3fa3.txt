FROM THE LAND

From the Land

Waiting for people from the land 
Where everything is green 
We know we'll help you understand 
Everything that you need 
My powers gone 
But yours are strong like me 
I am commander of the waves 
The sand beside the sea 
We don't believe were here today 
This garden so complete 
But I was wrong 
Now it's too long for me
