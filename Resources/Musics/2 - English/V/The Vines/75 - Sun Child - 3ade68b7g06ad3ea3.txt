SUN CHILD

Sun child
You're a sun child
Awoken by the spirit of the day
Will I wild
Speaking so mild
Forgot about the engine in the rain 
Don't let it bring you down
For us that ain't the way
We'll keep our lives reserved 
For those who have to pray
But I can't 

Sun child
You're a sun child
Awoken by the spirit of the day
Will I grow wild
Speaking so mild
Forgot about the engine in the rain 

Don't let it bring you down
For us that ain't the way
We'll keep our lives reserved
For those who have to pray
But I can't
