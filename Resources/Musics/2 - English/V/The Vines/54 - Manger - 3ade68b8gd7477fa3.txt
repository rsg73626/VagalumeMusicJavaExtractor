MANGER

Burnin down the manger
Cause my lord's a stranger
Beatles are bigger than Jesus!

Til the end of time
We will be alive
We know more now
Than we did then!

Well only be awhile
Makin the future right
Strung out and here today
We'll take your life away

Well only be awhile
Makin the future right
Strung out and here today
We'll take your life away

Hey!

Burnin down
The manger
