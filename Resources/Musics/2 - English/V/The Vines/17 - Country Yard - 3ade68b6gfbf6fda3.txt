COUNTRY YARD

I'm tired of feelin sick and useless 
then speakin every other way 
gluin my eyes together girl 
might be the right escape 

there's nothin in the secret garden 
just images of blue and white 
losin my mind forever girl 
maybe the only sign 

down in a country yard 
I was taken by the shadows 
although we couldn't see that far 
I was dreamin of tomorrow 
I really don't need a change 
I really don't need what's mine 
out in a country yard 
it'll be just fine 

aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhiiiiiii [x4]
