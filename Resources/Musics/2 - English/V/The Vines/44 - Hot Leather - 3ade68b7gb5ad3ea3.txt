HOT LEATHER

Wherever you are 
Wherever you start
Feels good and alive
When I'm floating to ground 
All your doing is killing time yeah
And all I'm doing is killing mine yeah 

I'm laying, in the sun
Cause I'm searching for one
Feels good and alive
When I'm floating to mine 

All your doing is killing time yeah
And all I'm doing is fucking mine yeah 

But it feels alright
I don't care
If you stay till night
I don't care
