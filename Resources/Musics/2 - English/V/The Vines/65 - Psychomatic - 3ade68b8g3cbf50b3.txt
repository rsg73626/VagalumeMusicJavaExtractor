PSYCHOMATIC

Live my life a child of the jago
It takes time to lose yourself
Come inside I'll show you the way home
It won't matter if you wanna

Get the car (start it up)
Drink the drug (throw it up)
Waste your love (chat it up)
With no practice
Shoot your gun (blow it up)
Make a son (screw it up)
Everyone (growing up)
Psychomatic

We'll get by with all that they don't know
Yes I'm right and now it shows
Just get high and think when you're alone
It won't matter if you're prone to

Get the car (start it up)
Drink the drug (throw it up)
Waste your love (chat it up)
With no practice
Shoot your gun (blow it up)
Make a son (screw it up)
Everyone (growing up)
Psychomatic

Oh me oh my what can you do?
(God won't save you God won't save you)
Each way you try you're gonna lose
Live your life a child of the jago
It takes time to lose yourself
Come outside I'll show you the way home
It's your right to give them hell
