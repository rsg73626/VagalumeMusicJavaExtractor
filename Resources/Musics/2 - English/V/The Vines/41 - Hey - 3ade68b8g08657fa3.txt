HEY

Hey
What are you doing today
I've had enough of my time
And so I threw it away
All away

Give me all or give me nothing
All I want and nothing more
I was bored and she is lonely
Wanting for no one to call

So
Is there ain't nothing you know
I've had enough of your smile
And so I'm letting it go
All let go

Give me all or give me nothing
All I want and nothing more
I was bored and she is lonely
Wanting for no one to call

Show me the daylight
Oh when I'm there
Tell me it's alright
Oh when I'm there
