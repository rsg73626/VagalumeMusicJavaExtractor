FUCK YEH

Yeah ma ma my baby
Yeah ma ma my girl
Yeah ma ma my baby
You'll never rule the earth

This ain't the real world
It ain't a fuckin' thing
People are full of hurl
And so are all their friends

Yeah ma ma my baby
Yeah ma ma my girl
Yeah ma ma my baby
You'll never rule the earth

Two of a kind
Three ain't a pair
Real love were blind
Now she don't care
