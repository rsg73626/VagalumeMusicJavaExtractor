LADYBUG

Love what have you done to me
She came in upon a summer breeze

Throw it away and never know
Nothing to taste when you're alone
I got the world and I don't need
No ladybug

Home is where I wanna be
Ladybug quit crawling on my knee

Throw it away and never know
Nothing to taste when you're alone
I got the world and I don't need
No ladybug

Nothing to say nowhere to go
Stuck in a maze when you're alone
I got the world and I don't need
No ladybug
