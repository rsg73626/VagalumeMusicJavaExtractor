MERRYGOROUND

On a merrygoround
Runnin into all the people ya wannaoo
And what its all about
Wasn't anythin that you thought or you knew. Nothing

Here we go round the merrygoround. Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Here we go round the merrygoround. Ah ah ah ah ah ah

On a merrygoround
Runnin into people that you don't wannaoo
And the place that ya found
Wasn't anywhere that you thought
Or you knew. Nowhere

Here we go
Round the merrygoround
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Here we go round the merrygoround
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

I don't know what is up
I don't wanna know

Here we go round the merrygoround
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Here we go round the merrygoround
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Yeah!
