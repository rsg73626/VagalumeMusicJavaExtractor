WICKED NATURE

I was dreamin of my love
But it never is enough
Cause I know too much about you
Even though I find it hard
I have known it from the start
How to always find my way through

With a nice sound I can feel light
Cause I know how to be right
When I feel down now I know why
I can freak out in my time

I was dreamin of revenge
But it only is pretend
So I forget all about you
Though remember all you said
But I always was ahead
Cause my way is never untrue

With a nice sound I can feel light
Cause I know how to be right
When I feel down now I know why
I can freak out in my time
