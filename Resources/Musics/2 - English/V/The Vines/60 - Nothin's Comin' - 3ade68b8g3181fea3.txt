NOTHIN'S COMIN'

Tell where I'm going to 
Got nothing I wanna lose 
Round and round and back again 
Grin upon my fucking head 

Nothin's comin' 
I feel your death 
Nothin's comin' 

Fallin' in or outta space 
So sick of our human race 
All for one ain't nothing real 
Tell you how I fucking feel 

Nothin's comin' 
I feel your death 
Nothin's comin' 

Nothin's comin' 
Nothin's comin' 
Nothin's comin'
