WINNING DAYS

The winning days are gone
Because I know just where I'm seeing
Was giving as I know
I can't hear 
Cause underneath there's gold
Ill need to get around to find it
When I wanna go
I can dream
I've been trying
All my time 

I'm just seeing it right
Cause it could be the light that's over me
So I just wanna let it be 

The winning days are gone
Because I know just where I'm seeing
Was giving as I know
I can't hear 

Cause underneath there's gold
I'll need to get around to find it
When I wanna go
I can dream
I've been trying
All my time 

I'm just seeing it right
Cause it could be the light that's over me
So I just wanna let it be 

Get up and go outside
It can help your mind too
Get up don't hide away 

Cause I know where there's gold 
I didn't know when I was flying
I'm sinking like a stone 
I can dream
I've been trying...
