GIVE UP , GIVE OUT , GIVE IN

Give Up, Give Out, Give In

Why were you, soft spoken
Make it as a man
I've been down, soul error
They can't take you back... 

They've gone mad!... 

Going down, show me how
I can't give up now...
I've been down, soul error
They can't, they've gone mad 

They've gone mad!...ahhhhh
They've gone mad!...ahhhhh
They've gone mad!...ahhhhh......ahhhhh 

Give up give out give in your time
It's overrated I hate my..
Give up give out give in your life
It's all the same but I get by...
Give up give out give in you time
It's overrated I hate my..
Give up give out give in your life
It's all the same but I get byyyyy....... 

(Oohh....)
