CANDY DAZE

Candy daze are here to stay forever
They light the way and keep us all together

C'mon C'mon
Singin' a song
It won't be long
For we are gone

Candy daze are here to stay forever
They light the way and keep us all together

It'll be alright
I don't know I say it might
It'll seem alright
She spit in my face
