TRUE AS THE NIGHT

Coming down, live by the side, of the railway.
Day goes by, into the night, i was thinking.
And my love is true, and my love is right.
And my love is true, true as the night, oh well.
Hear the sound, over the trees, there is a river.
I don't know, where to begin, or to end it.
And my love is true, and my love is right.
And my love is true, true as the night, oh well.

I stand alone, inside me.
The things you told, denied me.
yea we are the heart, yea we are the song.
I stand alone, inside me.
The things you told, denied me.
yea we are the heart, yea we are the song.
