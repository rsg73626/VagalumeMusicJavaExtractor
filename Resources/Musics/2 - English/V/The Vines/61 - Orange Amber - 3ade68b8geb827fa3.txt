ORANGE AMBER

Orange amber in the sun
Shining till the day is done
I remember long ago
Standing in that orange world

How did the time just slip away
I'd do anything to make it stay

Orange amber in the sun
Shining till the day is done
I remember long ago
Standing in that orange world

Been searchin high, been searchin low
Well, there ain't no better place to go

Orange amber in the sun
Shining till the day is done
I remember long ago
Standing in that orange world

Orange amber
Orange amber
Orange amber
Orange amber
