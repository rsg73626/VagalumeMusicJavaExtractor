1969

1969

Its 1969 in my head 
I just wanna have no place to go 
Livin thru the sound of the dead 
I'm gonna get stoned look round at my soul 

I'm hearin voices in the trees 
And seein footsteps in the rain 
I just wanna die before I loose my dol 
I have been cryin in my sleep 
Cause I dont kno where i've been 
I just wanna live to see another day 

Hey hey hey hey (x8) 

When I get my buick six 
I'll see my life drop in that whirlpool 
If I get to see you again 
You're the only one I know 

Here we go 
There I stand 
I'm a seed 
Of a man 
Dare I go 
Dare I stare 
I'm a seed 
of a man
