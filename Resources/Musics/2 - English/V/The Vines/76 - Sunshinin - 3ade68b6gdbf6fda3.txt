SUNSHININ

sunshinin rain's drivin 
don't wanna believe 
in the saints comin 
don't try'n fool my head 
the weather can be 
any place I am 

gone oh oh yeah 
gone yeeaahh 

drug buyin fake lightin 
don't wanna believe 
in the way I am 
don't try'n fool my head 
the weather for me 
are the birds flyin 

home oh oh yeah 
home yeeaahh
