GOOD ENOUGH

Everything
That you have
Isn't good enough
For you

Where you've been
Where you stand
Isn't good enough
For you

Look out of your window
Look up at the sky
And leave all your sorrow
Behind

Everything
That you have
Isn't good enough
For you
Where you've live
Where you stand
Isn't good enough
For you

There ain't any reason
There ain't any rhyme
Forget while you're sleeping
Tonight
Everything
That I have
Isn't good enough
For me
