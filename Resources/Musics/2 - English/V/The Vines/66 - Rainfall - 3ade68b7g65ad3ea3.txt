RAINFALL

We were hiding from the rain and the thunder
I've been staring out for days 
As I wonder a long day around 
So here we are again we're outnumbered
The feeling is a wave that I'm under
But I heard it call my name in the summer
Is it ever gonna change in my slumber 

I can hear myself walking through this world
Can't believe it's not 
They're talking so retarded
I don't know 
It might not show
Let me go
