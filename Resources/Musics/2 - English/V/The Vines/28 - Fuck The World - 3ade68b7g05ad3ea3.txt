FUCK THE WORLD

Walk the fields and
stare at the ocean
Roll the wheels but
Forget the notion
Life was better before was smaller
The mind's computer will 
Fuck the world up 

Fells like a dream
I know you want it
Don't fell supreme
Nobody got it 

World
Fuck up fuck the world
Fuck up fuck the world
Fuck up fuck the world 

Walk the fields and
stare at the ocean
Roll the wheels but
Forget the notion
Life was better before was smaller
The mind's computer will 
Fuck the world up 

Fells like a dream
I know you want it
Don't fell supreme
Nobody got it 

World
Fuck up fuck the world
Fuck up fuck the world
Fuck up fuck the world
Fuck up fuck the world, don't
Fuck up fuck the world, don't
Fuck up fuck the world, don't
Fuck up fuck the world, don't
