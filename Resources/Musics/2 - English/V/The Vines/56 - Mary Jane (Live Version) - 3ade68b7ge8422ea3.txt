MARY JANE (LIVE VERSION)

Mary Jane said life's a wait 
I already knew 
Because we're down 
We'll lose the town 
Just like I would choose 

Mary Jane said minds are games 
I went to the moon 
Before we know 
She'll have to go 
Wish I were there too 
But I've got to go 

Mary Janeâ€¦

Mary says 
I, I can love you 
Life's a wait 
Why the fuck should I lose?
When I've got to go 

Mary Janeâ€¦

Mary Jane smokes coke
And I'm awake
It's all that I can give
It's underneath the fridge

Mary Jane smokes coke and Iâ€™m awake
Itâ€™s all that I can give 
Itâ€™s underneath the fridge
It's so hard!
