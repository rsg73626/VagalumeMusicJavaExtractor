PRAISE TO YOU

For all that You are
And all that You've done
We gather in worship

We lift our hands to the One
Praise to You O Lord Jesus Christ
You will reign forever
Your name shakes the mountains
Your voice calms the sea
You're greater than my failures
For Your grace abounds in me
Holy Spirit come
Let your will be done
Have Your way in me
Your presence fills my heart
You're throned in majesty
We will glorify Your name
Jesus You are King!
