LORD HAVE MERCY

From our shame, from our guilt O Lord
Cleanse us from our sin make us holy
In your Name, in your blood O Lord

Blot out our offense, make us worthy

Lord have mercy
We're begging for mercy
Jesus only you make us worthy

From our weakness, from our betrayal
Cleanse us from our sin make us holy
In your kindness, in your compassion
Blot out our offense make us worthy

Lord have mercy
We're begging for mercy
Jesus only you make us worthy

Remember me when you come into your kingdom
