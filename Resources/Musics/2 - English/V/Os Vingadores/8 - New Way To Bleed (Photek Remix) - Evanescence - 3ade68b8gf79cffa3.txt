NEW WAY TO BLEED (PHOTEK REMIX) - EVANESCENCE

Serve your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why can't you speak?

I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
or just a new way to bleed?

So go and tell all your friends that I'm a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But it's my, my heart, my life that you're calling a lie
I've played this game before
And I can't take anymore

By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom, freedom can't you feel the ground caving in?
Freedom, give us a reason to believe again

I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed?
