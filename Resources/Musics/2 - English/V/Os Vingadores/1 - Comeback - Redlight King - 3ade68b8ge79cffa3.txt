COMEBACK - REDLIGHT KING

Yeah
Many times I walk the line
I rolled the dice and questioned my life
Many times I sacrificed and dealt with the pain
I been down this road before
Where the dead ends are, it rains and it pours
I been down below, and it's the past that I paint

Well, I know how it feels when you have to start again
Now there's no one to save me
I know how it feels when the world is gonna end, but they'll see

I'm gonna make a comeback
I'm gonna dig six feet up tonight
I'm gonna get it all back
I'm gonna make a comeback this time, yeah

Look into my eyes you'll see
A graveyard filled with dirt and defeat
Look into my eyes and see the weight on my soul
Where the fallen angels sleep,
The crooked hearts and crossroads meet
Where the haters say my name and carve it in stone

I know how it feels when I haven't got a friend
Even when they're standing beside me
I know how it feels when the world is gonna end, but they'll see

I'm gonna make a comeback
I'm gonna dig six feet up tonight
I'm gonna get it all back
I'm gonna make a comeback this time

Risk it all, I'm gonna risk it all
I'm gonna break my back and risk it all
I'm gonna pick my spot, take my shot,
Swallow my pride, and risk it all
I'm gonna risk it all and I won't look back
I'm gonna pick my spot, take my shot,
Swallow my pride, and risk it all

The lights on, the last round
The dark horse keeps on fighting

I'm gonna make a comeback
I'm gonna dig six feet up tonight
I'm gonna get it all back
I'm gonna make a comeback this time, yeah

I'm gonna make a comeback
I'm gonna dig six feet up tonight
I'm gonna get it all back
I'm gonna make a comeback this time

I'm gonna make a comeback this time, yeah

A comeback, a comeback
Gonna come back this time

I wanna come back, I wanna come back, I wanna come back
I'm digging up six feet tonight
