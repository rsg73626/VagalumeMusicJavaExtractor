EVEN IF I COULD - PAPA ROACH

I've got issues, so does everyone. 
That never stopped you from sleeping with this loaded gun. 
I'm sorry for everything I have done (everything I have done).

And now you're telling me 
that I am the one that won't amount to no good. 
I'd never die for you, not even if I could. 
And I am the one that's always misunderstood. 
I'd never die for you, even if I could. 
Die for you, you know I never would.

Mommy's little monster, 
wrapped inside a box. 
Can't forgive her, 
she threw away the f'kng key. 
I'll haunt her 
for the rest of her life (for the rest of her life).

You're always telling me

I'd never die for you, not even if I could. 
And I am the one the one that's always misunderstood. 
I'd never die for you, even if I could. 
Die for you, you know I never would. 

You know that I can never forgive you. 
You wear it out. 
You break me down (you break me down).

You know, you know I never would
You know, you know I never would
You know, you know I never would
