I'M ALIVE - SHINEDOWN

I'm alive!

So you were 6 feet underneath me
I feel the pulse I swear you moved
You digging deep deep down 
And recognized how much you had to lose

And if you wanna get out of here
Wanna get out of here
Save yourself
But you never get anywhere
Never get anywhere
Not without my help

(Say it with me)

I'm alive I'm alive
Well you're dead inside

I'm a slap in the face
To your lullaby
Got you all tongue tied
'Cause you're living a lie my friend

Say it with me

I'm alive I'm alive
Well you're dead inside

I'm your wakeup call
And you know I'm right
So make a move
Let it bleed
Tear your heart off your sleeve
But I'm the only one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's is gonna

So how far did you go for shelter?
How long did it take you to find
A place to sell your propaganda
And a harm peace of mind?

And if you wanna get out of here
Wanna get out of here
Save yourself
But you never get anywhere
Never get anywhere
Not without my help

Say it with me

I'm alive I'm alive
When you're dead inside
I'm a slap in the face
To your lullaby
Got you all tongue tied
'Cause you're living a lie my friend

(Say it with me)

I'm alive I'm alive
Well you're dead inside

I'm your wakeup call
And you know I'm right
So make a move
Let it bleed
Tear your heart off your sleeve
But I'm the only one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's is gonna

I'm alive I'm alive
Well you're dead inside
I'm a slap in the face
To your lullaby
Got you all tongue tied
'Cause you're living a lie my friend

Say it with me

I'm alive I'm alive
Well you're dead inside

I'm your wakeup call
And you know I'm right
So make a move
Let it bleed
Tear your heart off your sleeve
But I'm the only one whose gonna save your life
I'm the one whose gonna save your life
I'm the one whose gonna save your life
I'm the one whose gonna save your life
I'm the one whose gonna save your life.
