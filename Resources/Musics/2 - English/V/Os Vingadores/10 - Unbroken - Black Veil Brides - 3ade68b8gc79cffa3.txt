UNBROKEN - BLACK VEIL BRIDES

Now you're adrift in a sea of lies,
A foolish villain in an endless chapter.
The demons running behind you eyes,
A simple shadow we can fight together.

I'll never walk away…

Tear down, the walls that will surround.
Cry out, above the burning sound.
Show me, how bleeding hearts still pounds.
If we stand together we will be unbroken.

We carry forward into the night,
The strength of innocence like children's laughter.
An army standing for what is right,
We'll fall like angels, if we lose what matters?

I will not walk away…

Tear down, the walls that will surround.
Cry out, above the burning sound.
Show me, how bleeding hearts still pounds.
If we stand together we will be unbroken.

We will not walk away…

Tear down, the walls that will surround.
Cry out, above the burning sound.
Show me, how bleeding hearts still pounds.
If we stand together we will be unbroken.

Tear down, the walls that will surround.
Cry out, above the burning sound.
Show me, how bleeding hearts still pounds.
If we stand together we will be unbroken.
