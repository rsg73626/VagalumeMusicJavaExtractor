INTO THE BLUE - BUSH

Slick like a serpent's (lie/love?)
The queen on her Knight machine
Into the blue again
Worse than I've ever been
Bondage on most days
The freedom of the night
I waited at the corner for you
By the orange lamp light

Your flowers are hand grenades
Your words are weapons of their mind
Speak with an innocence
You can't be satisfied
Alive in the madness
In the contours of your heart

Into the blue again
Into the blue again
Blue blue blue

Your head is so open
U read like a book
I wish I was young again
I wish I was good
I wish I forever
Was tangible
I wish for constellations
To keep you faithful

Your flowers are hand grenades
Your words are weapons of their mind
Speak with an innocence
You can't be satisfied
Alive in the madness
In the contours of your heart

Into the blue again
Into the blue again

I see the warning signs
Don't let them rain
On you
I-I see the warning signs
Don't let them rain
On you

You hurt cause I love you
I never thought you would
Slipping away again
In this burning book

Your flowers are hand grenades
Your words are weapons of their mind
Speak with an innocence
You can't be justified

Into the blue again
Into the blue again

Your flowers are hand grenades
Your flowers are hand grenades
Into the Blue Again
Again
