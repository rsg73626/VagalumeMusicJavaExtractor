ROUND AND ROUND REMIX

Round, round
We keep going round and
We keep going round and
Round round and round
Round round and round
We keep going round and
Round round and round

I can't believe it
Here we go again
You're in your corner
You wanna do me in
And then that bell rings
To let the games begin
You playing dirty
And it's just so hard to win

Pre-Chorus:
You got my number
But you don't call me back
You got my tongue so
It's hard, I can't tell where I'm at
Girl what you doing?
Don't believe it amusing
Stop messing with my head
With you it never ends

Chorus:
We can go round and round and round
Baby we can go round and round and round
But damn you tear my heart apart, yeah
We can go round and round and round
But you always end up taking the crown
Cause girl your love it knocks me out, yeah

We keep going round and round and round, yeah
We keep going round and round and round and round and
round

Moving in circles
While I protect myself
You're throwing punches
You always aim to hit
Why can't we get along
Is that too much to ask?
There was a time when
You and me
We were good, good like that

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

You know how to hurt me like no one else
You know every soft spot of my heart so well
Your words are like knives
They cut me inside
Deeper and deeper everytime, yeah

Chorus
