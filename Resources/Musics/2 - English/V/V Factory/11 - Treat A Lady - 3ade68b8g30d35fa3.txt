TREAT A LADY

verse 1: 

what's goin' on with ya lately, you're not the same. 
someone took the light from your eyes and replaced it with pain. 
and, this ain't the jealous type a thing, cause i ain't the type, woah 
it's breakin' you apart, and i'm not just gonna stand by, no. 

pre chours: 

how 'bout the way he talks to you? 
tellin' you everything to do, 
watchin' ya every single move, 
girl don't be a fool. 

chorus: 

girl, he's always on your back even in front of your friends 
you're feeling like you're nothing when you're really a ten 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 
i hear some of them be saying you ain't worth this and 
to any other man you'd be a priceless gem 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 

verse two: 

now why you wanna let 'em keep playin', playin' these games? 
and, don't tell me you don't know what he's doin', when you're away, yeah. 
i don't understand how a girl as fine as you are, 
got him bringing you the moon on a platter under the stars, yeah. 

pre chours two: 

why are you home alone tonight? 
why is you're beauty outta sight? 
always just messin' with my mind, 
cause it just aint right. 

chorus: 

girl, he's always on your back even in front of your friends 
you're feeling like you're nothing when you're really a ten 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 
i hear some of them be saying you ain't worth this and 
to any other man you'd be a priceless gem 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 

breakdown: 

can i see the reasoning why, 
why he keeps on playin' with your heart? 
cause, if you were my girl, i would give you my world to be yours. 
stay forever by your side, 
never do a thing to make you cry, 
yes, if you were my girl, everything you deserve, you would have. 

chorus: ((times two)) 

girl, he's always on your back even in front of your friends 
you're feeling like you're nothing when you're really a ten 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 
i hear some of them be saying you ain't worth this and 
to any other man you'd be a priceless gem 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 

girl, he's always on your back even in front of your friends 
you're feeling like you're nothing when you're really a ten 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 
i hear some of them be saying you ain't worth this and 
to any other man you'd be a priceless gem 
and that's no way, no way, 
way to treat a lady, lady (like you) 


ending: 

treat a lady like, 
treat a lady like you, 
treat a lady like, 
treat a lady like..
