DOIN' IT TOO

You think you're slick
Tryin' to keep me in the dark
You're goin' through the motions
Girl you're rubbin' my heart
You act like I can't get worried about it
Heard you been doin' dirt
Inviting fellas to ya body
Throw a fit when come up in the house mad late
You ain't the same even girl
Let's set the record straight

I know somethin' that you don't
Like me hittin' other girls
Baby come clean cause you ain't foolin'

Chorus 1:
You ain't foolin' nobody
Give it to me straight
Girl, I know there's somebody
Else that you playin' oh
You ain't the only one I'm doin' it to
You wanna know just how I know
Girl, I'm doin' it too

Chorus 2:
Girl, I know all about it
We can work it out
Just tell me about it
You ain't gotta front now
You ain't the only one I'm doin' it to
You wanna know just how I know
Girl, I'm doin' it too

I see you went and got yourself another cell phone
One to keep in the car, the other one for home (When I
call ya)
You don't answer, but you send a text back
I know that game girl, yo what type of play is that
See we could work through this, all you gotta do is
Tell me the truth, we don't have to go through it
We've been together too long, to let someone come and
destroy our home

Oh, just let me know, ooh
What you really want girl
We could let this go
Unless you come clean cause

Chorus 1

Chorus 2

I put all my cards on the table (table)
So let me know just where you want to go from here
I got a girl on my right,
You got a man on your left
Baby, we're stuck in the middle tryin' to figure out
what's best
I ain't tryin' to lose ya
What we gotta do to
Keep this thing together

Chorus 1

Girl, I know all about it
We can work it out
Just tell me about it
You ain't gotta front now (you creepin' on me)
You ain't the only one I'm doin' it to (I'm creepin on
you)
You wanna know just how I know (you ain't the only one
that I'm doin' it to)
Girl, I'm doin' it too
