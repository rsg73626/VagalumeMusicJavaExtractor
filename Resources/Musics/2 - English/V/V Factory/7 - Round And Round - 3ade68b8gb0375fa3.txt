ROUND AND ROUND

I can?t believe it 
Here we go again 
You?re in your corner 
But you wanna do me in 
And then that bell rings 
To let the games begin 
You playing dirty and it?s just so hard to win 


Pre-Chorus: 
You got my number but you don?t call me back 
You got my tongue so tied I can?t tell where I??m at 
Girl what you doing 
Don?t find it amusing 
Stop messing with my head 
With you it never ends 

Chorus: 
We can go round and round and round 
Baby we can go round and round and round 
but damn you tear my heart apart, yeah 
We can go round and round and round 
but u always end up taking the crown 
Cause girl your love it knocks me out 

Movin? in circles 
While I protect myself 
You?re throwing punches 
And you always aim to hit 
Why can?t we get along 
Is that too much to ask 
There was a time when 
You and me were good like that 

Pre-Chorus 

Chorus x2
