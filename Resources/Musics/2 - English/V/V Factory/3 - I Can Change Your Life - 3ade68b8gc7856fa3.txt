I CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE

I can change your life
I know what you're use to.
And I can show you something that's better.
See girl I know.
He use to abuse you, he only used to get on my level.

[Chorus]
I can change your life if you let me.
I can do it. I know just what you need.
I can change your life.
Girl, you make me happy and if you let me.
And if you let me I'll make your puzzle complete.
I can change your life.

I know just what you needed.
Let me provide it, theres no need to fight this
thing.
Cause as long as I'm breathing you can believe it.
Going down on everything I love.
I wanna be, I wanna be, ay.
I wanna be, I wanna be, ay ay.
Definite, permanent, perfect.

[Chorus]
I can change your life if you let me.
I can do it. I know just what you need.
I can change your life.
Girl, you make me happy and if you let me.
And if you let me I'll make your puzzle complete.
I can change your life.

I can, change your, life.
This is where you should be.

[Chorus x2]
I can change your life if you let me.
I can do it. I know just what you need.
I can change your life.
Girl, you make me happy and if you let me.
And if you let me I'll make your puzzle complete.
I can change your life.
