PUMP IT

When you feel that (bass) in your (face)
Better recognize I came to rock this (place)
Ladies go ahead and wind that (waist)
Nevermind them haters frontin'

Mister (DJ) dig them (crates)
Gotta give the people what the people (crave)
We be gettin' busy 'til the break of (day)
Can you tell we're into something

Pre-Chorus:
Ooh, you better step on to the side
Gotta make this fire rise
Better shut it down and take you high

Chorus:
You didn't see us comin' comin'
But you can feel it pumpin' pumpin'
Now let me see you pop it, rock it
Pump it, bring that heat
You didn't see us comin' comin'
But you can feel it pumpin' pumpin'
Now let me see you pop it, rock it
Pump it, bring that heat

When we step up on the (floor)
Them girls like whoa
They ain't never seen it like this (before)
Everything we're doin' is straight up (whoa)
Can you feel the system pumpin'

Don't stop (no), can't stop (no)
Come on, let me see you put your hands up (oh)
Let me see your body drop down like (low)
You gots to keep it bouncin'

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

Jump into the party now cause you know I'm 'bout to
pop
Put the needle on the record now all the girls are
'bout to drop
Jump up lookin' fly tonight, gonna make this right for
you
Dance floor-see you shake it now
Wanna see your body move

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

Bring it on now
