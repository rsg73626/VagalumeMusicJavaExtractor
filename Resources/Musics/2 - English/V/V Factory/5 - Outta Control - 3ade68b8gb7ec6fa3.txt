OUTTA CONTROL

Verse 1

Baby I apologize
I hate to strike at you the wrong way
My baby
By the way that you walk
I’m left with just something to say
Say baby

Pre-Chorus

I keep having visions in my dreams
You’re like a celebrity to me

Chorus

I’m Outta Control
I just can’t help myself
She’s got me trippin, trippin
Oo flippin, flippin
Outta Control
She’s so bad for my health
She’s got me hittin, hittin
Spinnin, spinnin
Outta Control

Verse 2

Baby girl you’re just so fine
With the tiniest smile I get so blown away
Yeah baby
I’m at the borderline
Every time we get close I feel kinda strange
Why baby

Pre-Chorus
