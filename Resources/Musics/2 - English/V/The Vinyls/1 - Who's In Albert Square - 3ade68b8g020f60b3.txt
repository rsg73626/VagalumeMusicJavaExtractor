WHO'S IN ALBERT SQUARE

Well I'd hoped I'd treat myself to an evening of british sitcoms
but the masterplan was ruined from
the second that she came along
and the mind it always boggles why she cares
who's in albert square
and though it seems impossible to bear
I can't help but to stare

if I try to make a protest I'll be guarunteed that she won't listen
there's a drama on the other side I'd love
but its not my decision anymore
and it's pointless to attempt to start a fight
and sacrifice my pride
when I know I'll ultimately find
that I'm wrong and she's right

well I'm slightly miffed to hear her crying
but the actors moving on and so the characters crying
and the musics getting sadder
in this solemn atmosphere
why the hell is she crying?
he'll be back this time next year

well I thought that I'd enjoy and reenactment of the first world war
or a series about hammerhead sharks
that keeps repeating on channel 4
but the mind it always boggles why she cares
who's in albert square
and though it seems impossible to bear
I can't help
I can't help
I can't help
I can't help but stare
