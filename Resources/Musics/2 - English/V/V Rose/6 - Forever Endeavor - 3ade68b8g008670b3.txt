FOREVER ENDEAVOR

I could take my
chances falling down and
I could not be so distant from the ground
I could profit, profit
and just maybe win their crown
they only hate me cause I love you
but I don't care about now

Cause where I'm going no more smeared mascara
cause we won't cry
no broken pieces cause no one will die
everything brand new will feel so alive

And I wanna go
yeah I wanna goo
yeah I wanna go, go
yeah, I wanna go
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor (deavor, deavor, deavor)
Forever endeavor

Never forever I'll never go back
I piece with the promise, I promise you that
now caught up in coo - coo because of the fact
that you fight for me fiercelessly owe you for that
I owe you for that, owe you for that
Fight for me fiercelessly, owe you for that
move like the wind when you at it again
cause your whisperin'n, got me listenin'n
and then you go again sayin' I am your friend' I am your friend
I am your friend from beginning to end and all over again
(forever in a long time)
(forever in a long time)

I could put stock in to
chasing falling stars
and I could save myself
from getting certain stars
I could profit, profit
Be a perfect looking light
they only hate me cause I love you
but I don't care, would know why

Cause where I'm going no more smeared mascara
cause we won't cry
no broken pieces cause no one will die
everything brand new will feel so alive
and I wanna go
yeah I wanna go
yeah I wanna go
yeah I wanna go

Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
(deavor, deavor, deavor)
Forever endeavor
