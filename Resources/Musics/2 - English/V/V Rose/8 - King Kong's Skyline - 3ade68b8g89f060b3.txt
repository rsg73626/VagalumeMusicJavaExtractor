KING KONG'S SKYLINE

I know you won't trust anyone
You feel like your alone
So afraid of being let down
By those who say they won't
So you're raising up the bridge
You don't get who it is
You'll never let your guard down
You think I don't stand a chance
This I'll didn't seek romance'
Is not even a challenge love
I'll show you love
I'll show you love

I'll climb over king kong's skyline
I'll climb over king kong's skyline
Crashing through buildings and walls
If it even it all
Show you how much I care
I'll climb over king kong's skyline
I'll climb over king kong's skyline
I don't care how long it takes
Or how much I break
I'll find you no matter how high

Climbing over all
Oh oh oh

You believe me, yes I love you
But you'll still run away
Just to see if I will chase you
Will I give up or stay
And if I leave, up goes the bridge
No matter who it is
They'll never get your guard down
I'm not going anywhere
My love doesn't compare
It's nothing you can challenge love
I'll show you love
I'll show you love

King kong ohh ohh
Crashing through buildings and
Walls and then giving it all
King kong's skyline
I don't care how long it takes
Or how much I break
I 'll find you no matter how high

Climbing over all
Ohh ohh ohh

I'd never give you up, no
I died so you can know
You don't have end up all alone
I'd do anything to bring you home
