YOUNG DANGEROUS HEART

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh


We grew up sharing rooms
Dreaming big
Yeah every night sugar plums in our heads
Like, we was in the backyard drawing in the dirt
We was in the front yard kicking it with the birds
And we never had much but it made us real tough
And I never had doubt for you, doubt for your real love
That you had love for me
You was watching over me
You're the reason that I sing
From this heart that you've given me
Cause you still make me smile with flowers on my desk
In my home city still use my Gps
Still getting no sleep the night before a test
Don't usually promise anything
But I promise that I'll do my best
Cause
Night after day becomes me
When it's that fight in my eyes
When some say you can't do it all
But they don't know me at all

I've got a young dangerous
Young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
I've got a young dangerous
Young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
And they can tell me no
But they don't even know
The road I've traveled on
With my young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
Ohh
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da

I don't ever wanna get it twisted
Or let it go to my head
Cause everything I do
I do it for you, oh
Even when I'm taking a selfie
I give you the glory
You made me
And I hide your word in my heart every day
And hold onto the promise you made

I've got a young dangerous
Young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
I've got a young dangerous
Young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
And they can tell me no
But they don't even know
The road I've traveled on
With my young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
Ohh
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da

Night after day becomes me
When it's that fight in my eyes
And some say you can't do it all
But they don't know me at all
They don't know me at all
Night after day becomes me
When it's that fight in my eyes
When some say you can't do it all
But they don't know me at all
And they'll never stop you
If you believe what is in your heart
You've got something the world is ready for

I got a young dangerous
Young dangerous
Young dangerous heart

I've got a a young dangerous
Young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
And they can tell me no
But they don't even know
The road I've traveled on
With my young dangerous
Young dangerous heart
Yeah yeah
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
