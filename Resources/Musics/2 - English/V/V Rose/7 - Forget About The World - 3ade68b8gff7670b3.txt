FORGET ABOUT THE WORLD

Grab somebody by the hand
Make em, make em come with ya
Follow me like a band
I'm gonna paint a picture
Clear as glass, streets of gold
Brand new, nothing old
Tell me that you wanna go

Ya I thought so, ya I thought so
Ya I, ya I thought so
Tell me that you wanna go
Ya I thought so, ya I thought so
Ya I, ya I thought so
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah

Forget about the world
Forget about the world
Forget about the world
Forget about the world
Woah, woahh, woah, woahh

Forget about the world don't hold it tight, no
Forget about about the life were going tonight
Cause all of your riches all of the pearls
Their going to perish with the rest of the world
So forget it
We going tonight, we going tonight
We going tonight, we going tonight

We are going tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Come on look up to the sky who's in heaven but Jesus
Nothing can keep my eye that's good but Jesus
Save a cap a nothing no, I'm not living
For the gold, he's the one you wanna know

Ya I thought so, ya I thought so
Ya I, ya I thought so
He's the one you wanna know
Ya I thought so, ya I thought so
Ya I, ya I thought so
He's the one, he's the one

Forget about the world
Forget about the world
Forget about the world
Forget about the world
Woah, woah
Woah, woahh, woah, woahh
