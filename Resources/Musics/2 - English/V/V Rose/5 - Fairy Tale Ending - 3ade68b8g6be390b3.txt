FAIRY TALE ENDING

We ride off into the sunset
Hands up like eyyooh
Like it's the end of a movie
All my worries fade out

You grab my hand and pull me in
When I was way out
Don't need the peanuts
Or cracker jacks
I don't if we ever get back 'cause

Right here with you
Is where I'm gonna stay
They can try to
But can't you away

Hope to live with you forever
You forever
I was lost in the beginning
Now you found me. It's a fairy tale ending
OOh
I was lost in the beginning
Now you found me. It's a fairy tale ending
OOh

Things change, but I know that this won't
So I smile like eyyooh
They say that we can't be happy
But really, what do they know
'Cause your love is unconditional
And you stay the same so

Don't need the peanuts
Or cracker jacks
I don't if we ever get back 'cause

I'm rooting for the home team
That's never gonna change
And since you came and found me
I haven't been the same

Where you go I will follow
Your love is all I need
They think they know what's best
But you're the only one who knows what's best for me, so

This is how my mood go
Easy like a six
Sunday morning cruising with you

No matter how the wind blows
I know how this ends, so
There's no way that I'll never lose
There's no way that I'll never lose

I'm stayin' right here with you
