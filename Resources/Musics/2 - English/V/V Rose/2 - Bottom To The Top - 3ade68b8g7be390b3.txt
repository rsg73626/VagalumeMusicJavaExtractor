BOTTOM TO THE TOP

Oh, this is the world we know
Our heart is where we'll go
We'll go, we'll go
From the bottom to the top

Pictures old in the first grade
Saw myself on the big stage
Staring out the window looking up at the stars
Promising to myself that I will go that far
Didn't know how to get there
Throw me no but I didn't care
And I knew that it wouldn't be easy
But even if nobody believed me

I'll never forget that girl
I'll always know that she could conquer the whole world
I'll never stop believing, long as I can see it
I will never change
When I come from the bottom to the top
Oh, this is the world we know
Our heart is where we'll go
We'll go, we'll go
From the bottom to the top

I'll never forget who I am
Where I come from and where I stand
This stage is built for more than the music
More than the bass they can't erase all the things we say
And it's about grace that I'm in this place, anyway
And they can say what they want
But I know at the end of the day

'Cause nothing comes easy
That's what having matter
And they try and tell me
That you could be a star if you sing a little crazy
Isn't that crazy, hey
Oh, they're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change me!

I'll never forget that girl
I'll always know that she could conquer the whole world
I'll never stop believing, long as I can see it
I will never change
When I come from the bottom to the top
Oh, this is the world we know
Our heart is where we'll go
We'll go, we'll go
From the bottom to the top
Oh, this is the world we know
Our heart is where we'll go
We'll go, we'll go
From the bottom to the top
