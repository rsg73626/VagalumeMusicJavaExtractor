THREW IT ALL AWAY

Everything I thought I knew, I know
Everything I thought I knew
Everything I thought I knew it all away

Was lookin' out for you over my shoulder
Runnin' like the wind, I was getting colder
I did not want nothin' to do to do
They told me that I needed you, you

But I found myself wonderin'
Maybe good could come of it
And what if what they say is true

I feel like man I knew I knew
And that's when I threw I threw I threw
I threw it all away
Everything I thought I knew I threw it all away
I opened up my heart, you opened up my eyes
And that's when all I thought I knew, I saw right through the lies
And I threw it all away

Everything I thought I knew I threw it all away
We know how to love cuz he first loved us
When I was so lost I didn't want to trust
I knew that I needed to to
Told myself I got nothin' to lose

And I found myself wonderin'
Maybe good could come of it
What if what they say is true
I feel like man I knew I knew
And that when I threw I threw I threw
I threw it all away
Everything I thought I knew I threw it all away

I opened up my heart, you opened up my eyes
And that's when all I thought I knew
I saw right through the lies
And I threw it all away
Everything I thought I knew I threw it all away
Open up your heart, he will open up your eyes
And just throw it all away
