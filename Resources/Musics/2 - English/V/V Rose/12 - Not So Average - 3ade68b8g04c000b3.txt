NOT SO AVERAGE

Who made up the rules of how you got to be
Picture-perfect everything, so magazine (?)
I mean, I'm stuck in a world where I can't just be me

So what if my nail polish always chips
So what if I prefer to where my kicks
You know, models aren't really models when they're not modeling

Why don't you tell me something
Cuz what I'm really wondering
Is how long do you expect to be following
Trying to be a star like them
It's not the way you're gonna win, always trying to fit in

So I'm takin ay, ay, ay cuz no matter what you say, ay, ay
We goin do it God's way, ay, ay
Cuz I'm just your average, not-so-average
Ay, ay, ay, so tell em it's okay, ay, ay
You know what to say, ay, ay
I'm just your average, not-so-average girl

I'm just your average, no-so-average girl

So what if I don't got everything they have
I'm the prettiest, you can ask my dad (go ask him)
Cuz I'm not gonna spend my life chasing that

So what if I'm not a cheerleader and
So what if you don't even like my band (so what)
I'm gonna be happy with whose I am

So let me tell you something
You're more beautiful than them (than them)
Cuz who you have inside of you is part of Him
And trying to be a star like them
Is not the way you're going to win
Stop trying to fit in

Now we're takin ay, ay, ay, it doesn't matter what you say, ay, ay
We goin do it God's way, ay, ay
Cuz I'm just your average, not-so-average
Ay, ay, ay, so tell em it's okay, ay, ay
And we know what to say, ay, ay
I'm just your average, not-so-average girl

I'm just your average, not-so-average girl
The only way to shine like a star
Is to realize whose you are
You were created to go far (?)
Baby, doesn't matter what you look like
If you have Jesus on the inside
Cuz everything that you need, in your life
Ay, ay, ay, ay
