SINKING DEEP

Standing here in your presence
In a grace so relentless
I am won by perfect love

Wrapped within the arms of heaven
In a peace that lasts forever
Sinking deep in mercy's sea

I'm wide awake, drawing close
Stirred by grace
And all my heart is yours
All fear removed, I breathe you in
I lean into
Your love, oh, your love

When I'm lost you pursue me
Lift my head to see your glory
Lord of all, so beautiful
Here in you I find shelter
Captivated by the splendor
Of your face, my secret place

I'm wide awake, drawing close
Stirred by grace
And all my heart is yours
All fear removed, I breathe you in
I lean into
Your love, oh, your love

Your love so deep is washing over me
Your face is all I seek
You are my everything
Jesus christ, you are my one desire
Lord, hear my only cry
To know you all my life

I'm wide awake, drawing close
Stirred by grace
And all my heart is yours
All fear removed, I breathe you in
I lean into
Your love, oh, your love
