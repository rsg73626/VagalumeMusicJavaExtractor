WE'RE GIRLS

We love
We fight
We laugh when we cry
We don't know what we want
But we want it tonight

We're Girls
And no matter what
We know we can trust
That God made us us
So we gotta love us
We're girls, We're girls

To be honest, waking up
With a face full of make-up
All made-up
It really ain't glitter all the time

Million things are on my mind
And we may never know why we have crazy days
Might not understand this place
But God made who he meant who he make
And He meant to make who He meant to make

Yeah, And I wish I would've known
Times when I thought I was the only one
Million girls on the same page I was on
Searching like I'm on Amazon

Every day we be having a battle
Pressure to live life-- like a model
Not a model though

Alrighty, I-I tell a story that's never been told
Yeah, but that's the result watchin the throne
Let me, let me tell you all my matters
(Spit back to the future) (almanac)

I was found in the rough
Where the diamonds at
And since we made change
Now I know we're diamonds, what. Oh!

I shot for the moon, and I'm at the sun
So now I can't lose, I already won
We got a chance to be beautiful, a smile is always so suitable
But baby that shouldn't be new to you
Your value was never disputable

God made us just the way we are
We shine bright yeah
We're superstars
Full of love
Every single girl
So let's show the world
(We're Girls, we're girls)

We're girls
We're girls
We're girls

And no matter what
We know we can trust
That God made us us
So we gotta love us
We're girls
