CROWN THIEF

We live in a crazy-y-y-y world... oh no
Isn't it something?
People say you'll never be nothing
You'll never be something
Well you know what I think, I think
It's crazy for you to believe everything you hear
So take your hands, cover up your ears
And understand only God knows who you can be
So only he should be one to speak right

So don't let em let em get you down
'Cause your no good laying on the ground
My mom used to say you just shut em down
Don't let em steal your crown
Don't let em steal your crown oh no

Greater is my father in me than anyone around
I won't let you steal my crown
I won't you tie me down
No one's stealing my crown
I will throw it at his feet
No one is robbing me
And no one stopping me
(Look out for the crown thief)

Look at the long run
Look at everything that have done
Look where you came from
You don't wanna throw that out the way
Its not worth listening to what they say
Focus on the love, you should show
Every single place that you go
And turn em out
Like you turn the radio down
When the cops come around... Yeah

So don't let em let em get you down
'Cause your no good laying on the ground
My mom used to say you just shut em down
Don't let em steal your crown
Don't let em steal your crown oh no

Greater is my father in me than anyone around
I won't let you steal my crown
I won't you tie me down
No one's stealing my crown
I will throw it at his feet
No one is robbing me
And no one stopping me

No one (no one)
No one (no one)
No one
Don't let anyone
Take what you've been given

And let no one (no one)
No one (no one)
No one
Push you to the edge
Hold on to the ledge

Look out for the crown thief
Look out, look out for the crown thief uh
Look out for the crown thief
Look out for the crown thief
Look out for the crown thief

Greater is my father in me than anyone around
(Watch out, watch out for the crown thief)
I won't let you steal my crown
I won't let you tie me down
(Look out for the crown thief)
No one's stealing my crown
I will throw it at his feet
And no one is robbing me
No one is stopping me

Look out for the crown thief
