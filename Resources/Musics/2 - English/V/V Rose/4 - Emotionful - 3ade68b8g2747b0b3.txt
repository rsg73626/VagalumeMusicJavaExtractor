EMOTIONFUL

Ask me how I'm feeling
I'mma tell you that I'm chilling
But my temperature could be through the ceiling
You wanna be the villian

Like ooh-ooh killem ooh killem
(me in my feelings)
''cause oh no, don't speak on things
That they don't know
It's so hard trynna let it go
When tweet hit my phone made me wanna act crazy
But I can't say that they made me

We be like (eeyooh)
I love my haters
Then we let'em dictate us
Then we look like a fool
When we lose our control
Flying off of the radar

I know your emotionful
But don't let that take control
When your emotional emotional
No don't, don't no don't, don't, don't
You might be going through it yourself
But don't lose it. (oh no no no) 2x (okay)

Hey what you doing
Are you mad or you hot
But instead of trying put it to a stop
You push it over the top
It feels right but it's not
(here what I'm sayin)
Okay, everything you think don't say
''cause you don't wanna be like yeh
Takin eveything back
When the conflicts over regretting
The line you stepped over

We be like (eeyooh)
I love my haters
Then we let'em dictate us
Then we look like a fool
When we lose our control flying off
Of the radar

I know your emotionful
But don't let that take control
When your emotional emotional
No don't, don't no don't, don't, don't
You might be going through it yourself
But don't lose it

Careful with the words that you say
''cause they cut deeper than anything
Take some time before you react
The words you say you can't get it back
(no no no no no)

I know your emotionful
But don't let that take control
When your emotional emotional
No don't, don't no don't, don't, don't
You might be going through it yourself
But don't lose it
