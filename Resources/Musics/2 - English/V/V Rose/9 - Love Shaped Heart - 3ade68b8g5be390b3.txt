LOVE SHAPED HEART

Sometimes the mirror lies
And it's hard to see the truth
You feel the pressure all around you
You just can't get it right
No matter what you do
Insecurity surrounds you
And you say you can't take another day
You just don't see a way
There's so much more inside that you can't see

Just let it go, oh
'Cause you're worth more than you know, oh
Let the world see who you are, are
'Cause I can tell you how to love shaped heart

Some days you feel alone
Know there's people all around you
But they don't seem to get you
And you say you can't take another day
You just don't see a way
There's so much more inside that you can't see

Just let it go, oh
'Cause you're worth more than you know, oh
Let the world see who you are, are
'Cause I can tell you how to love shaped heart

So let it go, oh
You're beautiful so let it show
Build a fire from the spark
'Cause I can tell you how to love shaped heart

Sometimes it's hard but that will change
A love shaped heart will heal the pain
So close your eyes and smile inside
I know, I know, oh, oh, oh
That when it's hard it will change
A love shaped heart will heal the pain
So close your eyes and smile inside
I know, I know, oh, oh, oh
