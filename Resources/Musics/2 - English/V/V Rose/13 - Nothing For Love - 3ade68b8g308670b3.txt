NOTHING FOR LOVE

I let my highlights grow out like for 6 months
That has nothing to do with the song does it?
Start over

I used to think that one day I would find love, yea, (right?)
And just like cinderella it be too good to be (true... True story me though)
Cuz who could love me if they saw who I was (probably nobody)
And if they love me then it must be too good to be (true)

So grab somebody's hand tonight, tonight
Tell 'em that its gonna be alright
You've just gotta come through as you are
He don't care how bad you think you are
Hands up singin', oh
Hands up singin', oh

Its nothing for love
I used to think that one day
I would become (perfect... I think... Perfect yea)
And maybe then I'd finally be good enough to be... (good)
Like God was waiting for that day
To come (made sense to me then)
But I know now he doesn't care
About that stuff (he cares about you)

So grab somebody's hand tonight, tonight
Tell 'em that its gonna be alright
You've just gotta come through as you are
He don't care how bad you think you are
Hands up singin', oh
Hands up singin', oh
Its nothing for love

Live, laugh, love
Thats what we say in america
Happily forever after endings
Thats whats hot and trendy
And you're not on the right plane
Unless you're on board with us
Unless you've grown bored with us
Does this thing fly? Of course it does

Livin' outta my suitcase
Runnin' outta my travel toothpaste
I reach down and tie my shoelace
I catch this plane before its too late
In every way I am not perfect
I eat ice cream before dessert and
I don't worry 'bout the rest cuz
Its nothing for love
Its nothing for love
