NO BETTER U

I feel like hiding out
Underneath my hoodie, some days
I just don't feel pretty, some days
I admit that
I bet you didn't know I get like that
Everything's not glitter, sometimes

They mess with my head
Make me wish that I was
Someone else instead, hey
But then, I finally tell myself, stop
You don't need to be what you're not
Nobody to be better than you
So do what you do for God

Sometimes we wish we were someone else, but
You've gotta take a look at yourself and
Know that nobody else in the world can
Be a better you
A better you
Listen to me, please don't give up trying
I've been there too I've been the one crying
No one can be me better and I can't

Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you

I feel like giving up
Every other day you know
I really gotta pray, you know
And try to kick that
But sometimes life hits right back
I don't want to face the day sometimes
I really hate the rain sometimes
I try to keep dry
Seems impossible
However hard I try

But then, I finally tell myself, stop
You know that you only need God
Nobody to be better than you
So do what you do for God
Sometimes we wish we were someone else, but
You've gotta take a look at yourself and
Know that nobody else in the world can
Be a better you
A better you

Listen to me, please don't give up trying
I've been there too I've been the one crying
No one can be me better and I can't
Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you

Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you
God made you
Just like you are
So live for him

Don't worry about anyone else
One two three
Take a deep breath
Pick up your head
You gotta know
Sometimes

Sometimes we wish we were someone else, but
You've gotta take a look at yourself and
Know that nobody else in the world can
Be a better you
A better you

Listen to me, please don't give up trying
I've been there too I've been the one crying
No one can be me better and I can't
Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you
Be a better you
A better you
