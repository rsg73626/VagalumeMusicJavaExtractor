TORTURED MIND

I've got these pictures in my head
A thousand words to put to rest!
Cause to say them is wrong
They get me so angry
Feels like I'm going crazy
How do I move on

I wish I could spread my wings and fly
I wish I didn't always have to cry
Singing the same sad song
Started writing on this paper
Now screams and tears later
Every word dissapears
As it burns
P. s. This is goodbye
To my tortured mind
To my tortured mind

God takes this painted paper
I won't miss it any time
Ohh goodbye tortured mind

I hate the memories I've saved
I'm a photo book of grace
Sometimes I think its amazing
I'm saved
That's because the truth is
I don't wanna see things
Replay again
I wish I could forget

I wish I could breathe instead of sigh
I know I gotta face now what's inside
Forget the sad sad song
So wrote it all down on this paper
Left nothing for later
Now every word disappears as it burns
P. s. This is goodbye to my
Tortured mind
Ohh to my tortured mind

God takes this painted paper
I won't miss it anytime
Oh goodbye tortured mind
Yeahh
Tortured mind
I'm saying goodbye
I'm saying goodbye
