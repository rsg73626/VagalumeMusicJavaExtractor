NOT AFRAID OF THE MIDNIGHT

You could see the scars on my heart
If you knew where to start
If you knew of the part when I was told
I wasn't worth the gold
I thought I was strong until I met you
And I thought you would run
When you saw whats true
But no
You love me through all
I still fall down
And you're not proud
But what stands out
Is every time that I get up

So as the story goes
I might look fit for the ball
But I'm not perfect at all
Not afraid of the midnight
You love me although
This dress ain't even mine
Who cares if I'm out of time
Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight

I spent so much of my life
Tryna be someone you could love
So many little birds
In my ear telling me I wasn't good enough
But I never needed a carriage, yeah
Or slippers made of glass
You're teaching me how to live
And love like you love
And I'm gonna save the rest
And I still fall down
You're not proud
What stands out
Is every time that I get up

So as the story goes
I might look fit for the ball
But I'm not perfect at all
Not afraid of the midnight
You love me although
This dress ain't even mine
Who cares if I'm out of time
Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight
Afraid of the midnight
Not afraid of the midnight

Please let me never forget
There's no shoe
That I can't fit to gain your love
Because you gave you're love
