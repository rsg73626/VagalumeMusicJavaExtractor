STORMS

I have only ever known you, to be one
Who does what you say you'll do
I have only ever found you faithful

Every shadow every sorrow
You have mend my heart with open hands
My tomorrow love's already planned
(oh, oh oh)

For every valley walked before
You hold me for a thousand more
Through every fire, every war
When thunder roars I'm sure

You still the storms
You still the storms
You still the stoo. o o orms
You still the storms

My arising, every time it's
Every promise I have found in you
In your goodness, in your kindness
Just to know who I am running to... oo

For every valley walked before
You hold me for a thousand more
Through every fire, every war
When thunder roars I'm sure

You still the storms
You still the storms
Let the clouds fall in
Let the lighting blaze

You will find me standing unafraid
Let the clouds fall in
Let the lighting blaze
You will find me standing unafraid

I am not afraid
For every valley walked before
You hold me for a thousand more
Through every fire, every war

When thunder roars I'm sure
For every valley walked before
You hold me for a thousand more
Through every fire, every war
When thunder roars I'm sure

You still the storms
You still the storms
You still the stoo. o o orms
You still the storms

I have only, ever known you
To be does who does what you say you'll do
