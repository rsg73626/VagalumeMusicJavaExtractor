SWEATER WEATHER

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in california with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves on my sweater
Lets have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centred
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirts, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing I really wanna tell you about no
Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides your mind
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watched your face
Put my finger on your tongue
Cause you love to taste yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hard for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirts, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing I really wanna tell you about
No, no, no
Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

It's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

It's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater
