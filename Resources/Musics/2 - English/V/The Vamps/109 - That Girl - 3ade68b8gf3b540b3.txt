THAT GIRL

1, 2, 3, 4

Went out with the guys
And before my eyes
There was this girl she looked so fine
And she blew my mind
And I wish that she was mine
And I said 'hey wait up cos I'm off to speak to her'

And my friends said
(you'll never get her, you never gonna get that girl)
But I didn't care
(you'll never get her, you never gonna get that girl)
Cos I loved her long blond hair
(you'll never get her, you never gonna get that girl)
And love was in the air
(you'll never get her, you never gonna get that girl)
And she looked at me
(you'll never get her, you never gonna get that girl)
And the rest was history
(you'll never get her, you never gonna get that girl)
Dude you're being silly cos you're never gonna get that girl

And you're never gonna get the girl

We spoke for hours
(she) took off my trousers
(they) Spent the day laughing in the sun
We had fun
And my friends they all looked stunned yeah yeah
Dude she's amazing and I can't believe you've got that girl

My friends said
(she's amazin' I can't believe you got that girl)
She gave me more street cred
(she's amazin' I can't believe you got that girl)
I dug the books she read
(she's amazin' I can't believe you got that girl)
And how could I forget
She rocks my world
(she's amazin' I can't believe you got that girl)
More than any other girl
(she's amazin' I can't believe you got that girl)
(yeah yeah)
Dude she's amazing and I can't believe you've got that girl

And I can't believe you got that girl

She looked incredible just turned 17
I guess my friends were right
She's out of my league
So what am I to do?
She's too good to be true

1, 2, 3, 4

But 3 days later
Went round to see her
But she was with another guy
And I said 'fine'
But I never asked her why
But since then loneliness has been a friend of mine

My friend's said
(such a pity I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
I let her slip away
(such a pity I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
They tell me everyday
(such a pity I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
That it will be ok (yeah)
(such a pity I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
She rocks my world
(such a pity I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
More than any other girl
(such a pity I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
Dude its such a pity
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl

And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
