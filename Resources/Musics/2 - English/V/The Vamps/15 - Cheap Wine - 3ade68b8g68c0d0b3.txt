CHEAP WINE

I'm not thinking
When I'm drinking
I got secrets you don't know
But tonight I let them show
Tip of my tongue
So let me finish
I know I'm coming on too strong
But this buzz is coming on

Thinking about you, about you all day
About my hands all over your waist
I just need a couple drops of this
And I'll tell you
I'll tell you

I drank too much cheap wine
Gonna spill this heart of mine
Spill this heart of mine
Baby
I drank too much cheap wine
Gonna say what's on my mind
Say what's on my mind
'Cause I want you to know
that I'm drinking about you

(Drinking about you
'Cause I want you to know
 that im drinking about you
Drinking about you)

The room is spinning
My Inhibitions
Always getting in my way
But now I'm brave enough to say

Thinking about you, about you all day
About my hands all over your waist
I just need a couple drops of this
And I'll tell you
I'll tell you

I drank too much cheap wine
Gonna spill this heart of mine
Spill this heart of mine
Baby
I drank too much cheap wine
Gonna say what's on my mind
Say what's on my mind
'Cause I want you to know
 that I'm drinking about you

(Drinking about you
'Cause I want you to know
 that im drinking about you
Drinking about you)

I just want you to know
That I need just a little
So I can tell you
I'll be fine on my own
But I'd rather come home with you
If you're looking for someone
To hold for the night
At least let me try
Say what's on my mind

I drank too much cheap wine
Gonna spill this heart of mine
Spill this heart of mine
Baby
I drank too much cheap wine
Gonna say what's on my mind
Say what's on my mind
'Cause I want you to know
 that I'm drinking about you

(Drinking about you
'Cause I want you to know
 that im drinking about you
Drinking about you)

Cause I want you to know
 that I'm drinking about you
