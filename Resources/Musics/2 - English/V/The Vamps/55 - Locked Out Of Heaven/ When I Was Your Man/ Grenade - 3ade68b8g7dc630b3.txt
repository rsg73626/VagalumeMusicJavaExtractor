LOCKED OUT OF HEAVEN/ WHEN I WAS YOUR MAN/ GRENADE

Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ooh!)
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ooh!)

Never had much faith in love or miracles
(Ooh!)
Never wanna put my heart on the line
(Ooh!)
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
(Ooh!)
I'm born again every time you spend the night
(Ooh!)

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've give you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing
With another man

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said hey
When you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman that's just what you are
Yeah you smile in my face then rip the breaks out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
Cause what you don't understand is

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've give you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing
With another man

Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
