BURN

I need big dreams in city streets and bright lights
'Cause this seems to make me feel alright
And I want this one and I can take
And I can feel myself from the brick about to break

And I be lost and alone
And I'm scared to find my own
I need hope or control but something's pulling me in

It needs to hurt so we could work
And I need fire, so I can burn
And I need love, so I can learn
I'm just a boy with the world
At my feet to find a girl
Telling me to not get hurt, telling me but I won't learn
'Cause I want you and nothing can stop this
So let's sit and watch this burn
And as it ends up in ashes, we sit and laugh, yeah
We sit and watch this burn

I need your heart in both hand in my plans
Are to make you feel alright
But you want it all in good time
And I get it that you've been hurt before, no

And I be lost and alone
And I'm scared to find my own

It needs to hurt so we could work
And I need fire, so I can burn
And I need love, so I can learn
I'm just a boy with the world
At my feet to find a girl
Telling me to not get hurt, telling me but I won't learn
'Cause I want you and nothing can stop this
So let's sit and watch this burn
And as it ends up in ashes, we sit and laugh, yeah
We sit and watch this burn

When the world gets quiet, I'll scream your name
When your lungs get tired, the air will breath the same
Don't forget me, let me ease your pain
And every heart in breaking, don't let it slip away

It needs to hurt so we could work
And I need fire, so I can burn
I need love, so I can learn
Burn, 'cause I want you and nothing can stop this
So let's sit and watch this burn
And as it ends up in ashes, we sit and laugh, yeah
We sit and watch this burn

And I won't learn
'Cause I want you and nothing can stop this
So let's sit and watch this burn
And as it ends up in ashes, we sit and laugh, yeah
We sit and watch this burn
