NASTY

I was sitting all alone yeah
A lot on my mind
Felt a tap on my shoulder
I rolled my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Telling me lies
How can a girl say no when you flash that sexy smile
And you say
Ooh hey, wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake down baby

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

In the middle of the floor now
I just don't care
See my body so low now
Crowd stops and stares
Let 'em take what they want but I'm feelin' it
And it's for you baby
Tell me how can a boy say no
When you calling out your name
And you say
Ooh hey, wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake down baby

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

What's your fantasy? (Ooh nasty nasty)
Tell them all to me (Ooh nasty nasty)
Don't you be afraid (Ooh nasty nasty)
Share your nasty secret baby hey

Ooh hey, wanna see you get nasty baby
Wanna see you shake down baby

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type
