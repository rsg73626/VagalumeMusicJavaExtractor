TIME IS NOT ON OUR SIDE

You're getting better, better
At guessing letters, letters
I'm writing with my fingers now
And we're just watching, watching
Dust on the curtain, curtain
Illuminated, falling down

Now we've got the doors closed
and you're telling me
You are mine and you'll go anywhere with me
Tell me, can we stay right here
and never leave?
I could go on and on
But time is not on our side

Waiting for the light
Night after night
Night after night
And I know
I will slip away
Day after day
Day after day
'til we're old
All I wanna do
Is lie next to you
Lie next to you and stay close
But time is not on our side

Looking in your eyes
Night after night
Night after night
And I see
Where I gotta stay
Day after day
Day after day
To find peace
All I gotta do
Is lie next to you
Lie next to you and just breathe
But time is not on our side

We never wake up, wake up
We only stay up, stay up
And let the seconds chase us down
But we're learning, learning
Nothing's certain, certain
So can we stop the clock for now?

Now we've got the doors closed
and you're telling me
You are mine and you'll go anywhere with me
Tell me, can we stay right here
and never leave?
I could go on and on
But time is not on our side

Waiting for the light
Night after night
Night after night
And I know
I will slip away
Day after day
Day after day
'til we're old
All I wanna do
Is lie next to you
Lie next to you and stay close
But time is not on our side

Looking in your eyes
Night after night
Night after night
And I see
Where I gotta stay
Day after day
Day after day
To find peace
All I gotta do
Is lie next to you
Lie next to you and just breathe
But time is not on our side

Oh no
Time is not on our side
And I could go on and on
Time is not on our side

Waiting for the light
Night after night
Night after night
And I know
I will slip away
Day after day
Day after day
'til we're old
All I wanna do
Is lie next to you
Lie next to you and stay close
But time is not on our side

Looking in your eyes
Night after night
Night after night
And I see
Where I gotta stay
Day after day
Day after day
To find peace
All I gotta do
Is lie next to you
Lie next to you and just breathe
But time is not on our side

'Cause time is not on our side
