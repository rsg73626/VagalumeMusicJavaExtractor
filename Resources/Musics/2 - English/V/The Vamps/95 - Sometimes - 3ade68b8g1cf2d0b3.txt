SOMETIMES

Should I be waiting on the high life
Where we all drink champagne?
Fly first class on jet planes
Rut shoulders in the right way
We had a conversation about
How I should be received
And everyone agreed, everyone except me

Maybe I'm selfish, could be obscene
But it feels like home when you're next to me
And I don't wanna leave, if I had a choice
Well then, I'd choose to make you walk
A mile in my shoes what have you got to lose?

So I've been waiting for an opportunity
Just to speak my mind, if that's alright
Might just be a couple hours out of my whole week
Usually I'm fine, it's okay not to be okay sometimes

I've been looking for some comfort in a stranger's bed
All it does is fuck my head up
Now I'm right back to square one

But if you're looking for some comfort
I've come to the right place
We all get down some days
I struggle just to put my t-shirt on
But I hope you find some strength in this song

Maybe I'm selfish, could be obscene
But I'm just tryna make you see what I see
Everyone's like me

So I've been waiting for an opportunity
Just to speak mind, if that's alright
Might just be a couple hours out of my whole week
Usually I'm fine, it's okay not to be okay sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
