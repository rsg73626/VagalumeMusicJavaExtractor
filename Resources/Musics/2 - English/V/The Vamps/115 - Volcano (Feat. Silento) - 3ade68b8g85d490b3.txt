VOLCANO (FEAT. SILENTO)

Give me a tear drop, I'll give you an ocean
Give me a breath, and I'll give you a storm
Give me a spark, and I'll give you explosions
Love's just a mountain 'til it overflows
Volcano

I give you the multitude of everything you wish
Don't have to take a portion, you can have the whole dish
Leave it up to me, let me take all of the expense
Baby when I caught your heart, I knew I didn't miss
Meet me on the field, and I'll give you the whole yard
You came and lit my fire, so our future will spark
There's something like a story, now we write our own book
It's okay, just one thing, got the whole world shook

Run deep like the ocean, I'll drown in your love
You never have to wonder why I spend my whole life with you

Give me a tear drop, I'll give you an ocean
Give me a breath, and I'll give you a storm
Give me a spark, and I'll give you explosions
Love's just a mountain 'til it overflows
Volcano

Run deep like the ocean, I'll drown in your love
You never have to wonder, just let it all flow
Baby it's just you and I, no one, no one can stop our loving
Wanna spend my whole life with you

Give me a tear drop, I'll give you an ocean
Give me a breath, and I'll give you a storm
Give me a spark, and I'll give you explosions
Love's just a mountain 'til it overflows

Give me a tear drop, I'll give you an ocean
Give me a breath, and I'll give you a storm
Give me a spark, and I'll give you explosions
Love's just a mountain 'til it overflows
Volcano
Volcano
