GIRLS ON TV

Dear diary
Want to make a new entry
Oh, you wouldn't believe me
What began today

Well, she called me
Oh that girl from the party
And I thought she should be on Tv
When I first saw her face

She said
"Alright what are you doing 'til daylight?"
So I chanced it
I said, "dancing with you"

She got legs like Beyonce
Give me the eye like Rihanna
And I wanna put her on camera
Cause she drives me crazy, crazy, crazy

Don't need no game show
Or a Hollywood movie, pop video
Cause as long as she's next to me
I got all the girls on Tv
I got all the girls on Tv
I got all the girls on Tv

Dear diary
We finished dinner early
And the way that she kissed me
Sent us on our way

And she danced like
A professional all night
And the stars were her spotlight
The city became her stage

And I said
"So, can I buy a ticket to your show?"
She said
"Front row if I go home with you"

She got legs like Beyonce
Give me the eye like Rihanna
And I wanna put her on camera
Cause she drives me crazy, crazy, crazy

Don't need no game show
Or a Hollywood movie, pop video
Cause as long as she's next to me
I got all the girls on Tv
I got all the girls on Tv
I got all the girls on Tv

Like a star on a silver screen
Oh I'm punching above my weight
We're from different sides of the street
And I know, I know, I know
Still a little mysterious
Why she taking me seriously?
