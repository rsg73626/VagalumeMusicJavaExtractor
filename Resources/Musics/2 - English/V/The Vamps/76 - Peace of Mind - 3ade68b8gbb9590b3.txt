PEACE OF MIND

So if I said to you that last night
Would be the last night out of a million
Would you, would you be angry?
Don't be a scardy, I'll explain it all to you

I've been living outta my suitcase
Gotta find new ways to keep my head out of the clouds
I've been living in hotel bars, I don't know where we are
Can we wait just a minute?
Oh my friends, all my friends are gonna go to uni
Get a good job and degrees, no baby I don't care
I don't care for anything at all, at all
It's so wrong, let's go home

So give me some! (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
Let me know where I went wrong
All these years and years
I wish I had (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
I don't need nothing just some little things
And give me peace of mind

Between me and you when I was younger
I was scared I'd never make it through my life
I thought I'd be sitting at home playing video games
Wishing that I had a wife
It's so wrong, let's go home

But first just give me some! (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
Let me know where I went wrong
All these years and years
I wish I had (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
I don't need nothing just some little things
Gotta give me peace of mind

Time after time I've been telling myself
That living ain't too easy but it's good for your health
But I wake up in the morning with your head on my chest
Put my mind to rest so why can't you just come and

Give me some! (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
Let me know where I went wrong
All these years and years
I wish I had (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
I don't need nothing just some little things
Gotta give me peace of mind

Time after time I've been telling myself
That living ain't too easy but it's good for your health
But I wake up in the morning with your head on my chest
Put my mind to rest

I wish I had (Peace of mind)
So give me some! (Peace of mind)
I don't need nothing just some little things
Gotta give me peace of mind
