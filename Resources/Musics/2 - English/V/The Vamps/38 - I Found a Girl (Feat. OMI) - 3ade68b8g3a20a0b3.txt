I FOUND A GIRL (FEAT. OMI)

This girl moved into my apartment
One look at her my heart was stopping
I did whatever she was asking
She said "Maybe later, catch you in the elevator"
A couple days we got to hanging
Since now she wasn't even taken
I made a move she said
"Baby you're mistaken, I'm not into bacon"

She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry

Cause I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried, but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice, but she's not into guys
I found a girl

I should've known to walk away then
I should've left it alone
But when she'd call me on the phone
We'd be hanging again under the premise of friends
But now she only talks to me about some other woman
She says

She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry

Cause I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried, but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice, but she's not into guys
I found a girl
I found a girl

She putting up her defense
Cause her recent pushed her over the deep end
Now the girls are coming over for the weekend
If you didn't get an invitation, she will resend
Slumber party, no boys allowed
Bring out the dog, yeah, toys are allowed
No Tom, no Harry, no? allowed
Can't believe that I found a girl

Cause I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried, but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice, but she's not into guys
I found a girl
Found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried, but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice, but she's not into guys
I found a girl
