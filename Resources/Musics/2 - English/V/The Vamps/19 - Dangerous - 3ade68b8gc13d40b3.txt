DANGEROUS

So wake me up
'Cause I've been asleep now, for days
How do I get up?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

And way back when
We used to fall hard, in love
How to mess it up?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

This ain't the end of us
Darling let me show you
I am good enough
Maybe in the end I should've toughened up
Not self-destruct
But I'll see her again

Met a girl and she is dangerous
Hope I knew her, but I just can't get enough
I'm struck
She's gonna tear me up
A million voices never mean to never give you up
Shouldn't listen, I'm addicted to this darker love
And this is dangerous, for me

I must confess
I'm feeling guilty
My conscience is heavy
I'm a wreck
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

This ain't the end of us
Darling let me show you
I'm not giving up
I tried to tell myself that I can toughen up
Not self-destruct
But I'll see her again

Met a girl and she is dangerous
Hope I knew her, but I just can't get enough
I'm struck
She's gonna tear me up
A million voices never mean to never give you up
Shouldn't listen, I'm addicted to this darker love
And this is dangerous, for me

Even though I said I'm sorry
I still go back
Always go back
Back to her

This ain't the end of us
Darling let me show you
I am good enough
Maybe in the end I should've toughened up

Met a girl and she is dangerous
Hope I knew her, but I just can't get enough
I'm struck
She's gonna tear me up
A million voices never mean to never give you up
Shouldn't listen, I'm addicted to this darker love
And this is dangerous, for me
