SOMEBODY TO YOU

Yeah, you!

I used to wanna be
Living like it's only me
But now I spend my time
Thinkin' about a way to get you off my mind

Yeah, you!

I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike

Yeah, you!

Look at me now, I'm falling
Can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on keeps shaking
Oh, oh, oh, now!

All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Yeah, you!

I used to run around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face

Yeah, you!
I've got your photograph
But baby I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this

Yeah, you!
Look at me now, I'm falling
Can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground of mine keeps shaking
Oh, oh, oh, now!

All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Yeah, you!
Look at me now, I'm falling
Can't even talk, still stuttering
All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you!

All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you [somebody to you]

Cause all I wanna be, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Yeah, you!
