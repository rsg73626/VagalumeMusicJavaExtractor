ALL AROUND THE WORLD

You know you love me,I know you care
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there
You want my love, You want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing!
"We're just friends"? What are you saying?
Said there's another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us(2x)

Body rock, girl I can feel your body rock (eh, eh, eh)
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off (eh, eh, eh)
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the fine things in life
So just forget about the world, be young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

And all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Baby, baby, baby no
Baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
