HURRICANE

Rolled out of bed today
And I feel brand new
And I cannot explain
So let me show you
I feel alive
And I'm gonna have to let it show
Try kick me down I'm a full hot air balloon
I'm gonna take this in my side

I'm feeling tip top
I'm not gonna stop
Tapping my shoes
I ain't got a clue
Got nothing to lose
So watch me move
It's a brand new day
I'mma hit you like a hurricane

I blow the clouds away
Spinning like a whirlwind lost within the stars
Smiling in the rain
Now the drops can tear my world apart

And I fly
Gonna show let them know
That this is a smile
Hold me down but I'mma tell the world that I'm high
My head's up in the sky

I'm feeling tip top
I'm not gonna stop
Tapping my shoes
I ain't got a clue
Got nothing to lose
So watch me move
It's a brand new day
I'mma hit you like a hurricane

And so, I hope the grass gets greener
I'm sure, it's gonna all get clearer
I know, I'm gonna turn this around
Cuz I'm not gonna let you try to keep me down

I'm feeling tip top
I'm not gonna stop
Tapping my shoes
I ain't got a clue
Got nothing to lose
So watch me move
Cuz I'm
I'm feeling tip top
I'm not gonna stop
Tapping my shoes
I ain't got a clue
Got nothing to lose

With you

I'm feeling tip top
I'm not gonna stop
Tapping my shoes
I ain't got a clue
Got nothing to lose
So watch me move
It's a brand new day
I'mma hit you like a hurricane
(I'mma hit you like a hurricane)

I'm feeling tip top
I'm not gonna stop
Tapping my shoes
I ain't got a clue
Got nothing to lose
So watch me move
It's a brand new day
I'mma hit you like a hurricane
(I'mma hit you like a hurricane)
