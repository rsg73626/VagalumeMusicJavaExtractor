BE WITH YOU

Hey lover, I'm questioning our love song
How did we get the words wrong?
Hey lover, the key's in the ignition
But nothing's in the engine

And just when I'm about to say
I'm sick of you, so go away
You do that little thing you always do
And then I know

Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you

Hey lover, I'm screaming on the inside
I'm running but I can't hide
Hey lover, with everything we've been through
A fool would only doubt you and I doubt you

And just when I'm about to say
It's time to throw it all away
You look at me the way only you can do
And then I know

Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you

I wanna be with you when the love is right
I wanna be with you even when we fight
I wanna be with you 'til the day we die
I wanna be with you when the love is right
I wanna be with you even when we fight
I wanna be with you 'til the day we die

And just when I'm about to say
It's time to throw it all away
You look at me the way only you can do

Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
Oh girl I wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
