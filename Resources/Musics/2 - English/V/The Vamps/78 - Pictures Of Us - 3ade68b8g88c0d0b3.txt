PICTURES OF US

Is it your fault or my fault?
Tell me who's taking the blame
Is it your arms or my arms?
How'd we let it slip away?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Do you even remember me?
Are you seeing what I'm seeing
Or am I just a memory?

All those summer nights over in a flash
But forever last, baby
Every time that I think I'm moving on
I just stumble on

Pictures of us on the screen
They don't tell the story right
Only the capturing the nights
We were in love
You and me
They just make me want you back
That's why I shouldn't be looking at pictures of us
Pictures of us, pictures of us, pictures of us, pictures of us

Is it your eyes or my eyes
That's making the tears fall?
Is it your loss or my loss?
It's got me all emotional
Are you hurting like I'm hurting?
Is your heart back in one piece?
Do you miss it like I miss it
Or am I just a memory?

All those summer nights over in a flash
But forever last, baby
Every time that I think I'm moving on
I just stumble on

Pictures of us on the screen
They don't tell the story right
Only the capturing the nights
We were in love
You and me
They just make me want you back
That's why I shouldn't be looking at pictures of us
Pictures of us, pictures of us, pictures of us

All those summer nights over in a flash
But forever last, baby
I just don't know why if you don't want me back
Why you're still looking at

Pictures of us on the screen
They don't tell the story right
Only the capturing the nights
We were in love
You and me
They just make me want you back
That's why I shouldn't be looking at pictures of us
Pictures of us, oh no, pictures of us, oh, pictures of us
Pictures of us
