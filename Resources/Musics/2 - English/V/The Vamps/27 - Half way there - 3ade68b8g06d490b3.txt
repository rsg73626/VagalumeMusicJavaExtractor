HALF WAY THERE

We're somewhere between being friends
And something else I really wanna be
You spent a whole year wondering if
I see you in the same way you see me

I'll admit for a moment, I apologise I guess I just lost my head

But she said: why stop now when you're half way there?
When you're half way there
And I know, I know, I know, I know that you're scared to care
But you're half way there

Drive down to Nyc, just you and me
A secondhand car and some dreams
But dreams are hard to hold on to
When you know that you don't have the means

From time to time, you know in life, you blow a tire and you ain't got no spare

Oh but she said: we can't stop now when we're half way there
When we're half way there
And I know, I know, I know, I know you're scared to care
But we're half way there

Take your time, the way is long
And all the roads are open wide
Praying every time that you don't change your mind
Keep on moving forward, one mile at a time

Cause we're half way there
We're half way there
And I know, I know, I know, I know you're scared to care
But we're half way there

We're somewhere between being friends
And something else I really wanna be
You spent a whole year wondering if
I see you in the same way you see me
