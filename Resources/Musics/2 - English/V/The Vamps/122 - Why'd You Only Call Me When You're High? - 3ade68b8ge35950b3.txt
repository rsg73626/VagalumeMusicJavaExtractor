WHY'D YOU ONLY CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE HIGH?

Three, four!

The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side

And as I arrive I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high? "
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high? "

Somewhere darker
Talking the same
I need a partner
Well, are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high? "
"High, Why'd you only call me when you're high? "

It's the real place to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mamma rolling that body got every man inuition

Sippin' on Coke and Rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freaking weekend baby, I'm about to have you some fun

It's the real place to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mamma rolling that body got every man inuition

Sippin' on Coke and Rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freaking weekend baby, Vamps on Radio 1
