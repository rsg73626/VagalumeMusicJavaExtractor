SAME TO YOU

Hey girl, what's up?
What's on your mind?
Heard you moved on, 
at least you tried
Packed up your things and drove for miles
I had to smile
I know you can't sleep, 
it's past three, and you're still up
Get on the group text about your ex
'Cause I messed it up
Heard you moved on, 
well that's a lie

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same to you?
Does he hold you like me?
Make you feel free
Open your eyes and you will see
All of the awkward situations
Holding his hand you wish was mine
Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same, feel the same to you?

Hey girl, what's up?
I'm checking in to see 
if you're ready to love again
Don't have to be heavy
but you can't pretend we can stay friends
Every street sign I drive by, it takes me back
Right to the bedroom, your perfume, little black dress
You say you love me
while your hands wrapped 'round my neck
Do you miss me yet?

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same to you?
Does he hold you like me?
Make you feel free
Open your eyes and you will see
All of the awkward situations
Holding his hand you wish was mine
Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same, feel the same

To you, to you, to you, to you, to you
Does it feel the same
To you, to you, to you, to you, to you
Feel the same

Now I can't sleep, 
it's past three, and I'm still up
Got on the group text about my ex
'Cause you messed me up
You heard I moved on, well that's a lie
Well that's a lie
Does it feel the same to you?

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same to you?
Does he hold you like me? (like me)
Make you feel free (so free)
Open your eyes and you will see
All of the awkward situations
Holding his hand you wish was mine
Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same, feel the same to you?
Does it feel the same to you?
