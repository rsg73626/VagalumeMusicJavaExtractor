FIVE COLOURS IN HER HAIR

Do do do do do doo

She's got a lip ring and five colours in her hair
Not into fashion but I love the clothes she wears
Her tattoo's always hidden by her underwear
She don't care

Everybody wants to know her name
I threw a house party and she came
Everyone asked me
Who the hell is she?
That weirdo with five colours in her hair

She's just a loner with a sexy atittude
I'd like to phone her coz she puts me in the mood
The rumours spreading now that she cooks in the nude
She don't care
She don't care

Everybody wants to know her name
How does she cope with her new found fame?
Everyone asks me
Who the hell is she?
That weirdo with five colours in her hair

She was all I thought about
The girl I couldn't live without
But then she went insane
She couldn't take the fame
She said I was to blame
She'd had enough
And shaved five colours off
And now she's just a weirdo with no name

Everybody wants to know her name
How does she cope with her new found fame?
Everyone asks me
Who the hell is she
That weirdo with five colours in her hair

Do do do do do doo
