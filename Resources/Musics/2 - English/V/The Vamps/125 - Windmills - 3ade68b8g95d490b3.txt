WINDMILLS

You know I've always been a little bit grounded
Always thinking 'bout how to get by
But ever since I met you
Yeah I've been dreaming and I don't know why
Cause when I think of you, I get a little feeling
And it starts to bubble up inside
And then I'm all messed up
Cause all I see is windmills in the sky

You got me acting like a schoolgirl
You got me cheering like your number one fan
My head's spinning like a windmill
And all you have to do is touch my hand
You know I lie awake at night now
Just imagining how it would feel
If you were lying by my side now
It's the thought of you that makes you real

You do, what only you can do to me, it's true
You do, what only you can do, hey

You know I've always been a little bit grounded
Always thinking 'bout how to get by
But ever since I met you
Yeah I've been dreaming and I don't know why
Cause when I think of you, I get a little feeling
And it starts to bubble up inside
And then I'm all messed up
Cause all I see is windmills in the sky

You got me twiddling my hair now
You got me screaming when you call my name
My head is spinning like a windmill
And all you have to do is look my way
You know I lie awake at night now
Just imagining how it would feel
If you were lying by my side now
It's the thought of you that makes you real

You do, what only you can do to me, it's true
You do, what only you can do, hey

You know I've always been a little bit grounded
Always thinking 'bout how to get by
But ever since I met you
Yeah I've been dreaming and I don't know why
Cause when I think of you, I get a little feeling
And it starts to bubble up inside
And then I'm all messed up
Cause all I see is windmills in the sky

Spin me, spin me round, so high off the ground
You take me so high, like a windmill in the sky
Cause all I see is windmills in the sky
Spin me, spin me round, so high off the ground
You take me so high, like a windmill in the sky
Cause all I see is windmills in the sky
Spin me, spin me round, so high off the ground
You take me so high, like a windmill in the sky
Cause all I see is windmills in the sky
