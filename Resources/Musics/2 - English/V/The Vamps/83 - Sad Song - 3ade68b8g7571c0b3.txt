SAD SONG

So many nights, so many days
To all of the fights, 'cause I never behave
And I'm putting it right, 
hope it isn't too late
And I know, you know, I know
we can't let it end this way

Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
And the one thing I regret is
I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
You're still running through my head

So hold on, baby
Know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy, oh
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

So many nights, we're staying up late
Scratches and bites, you screamin' my name
Is he loving you right, or am I too late
'Cause I know, you know, I know
I can't let it end this way

Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
Girl you're still running through my head

So hold on, baby
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby

So hold on, baby
Know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy, oh
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, shit, you made me happy
