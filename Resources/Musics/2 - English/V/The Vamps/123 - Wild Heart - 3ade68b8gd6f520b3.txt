WILD HEART

I was walking away
But she's so beautiful it made me stay
I don't know her name
But I'm hoping she might feel the same
So here I go again
She got my heart again

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Ooh she needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart

Stay here my dear
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
My mind's made up
Tell me that you feel this
You know I won't give up
I won't give up

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oooh she needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Ooh she needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart

And I know it's late and I know it's cold
So come right here and
I swear I'll never let you go
The way you move is wonderful
Let's do it now cause one day we'll both be old
Oh woah woah

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Ooh she needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Ooh she needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Ooh she needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
