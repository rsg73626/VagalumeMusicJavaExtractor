YEAR 3000

One day when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah, yeah
He said

I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is pretty fine (is pretty fine)

He took me to the future in the Flux thing and I saw everything
Boybands and another one and another one, and another one
Triple breasted women swim around town, totally naked!

We drove round in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah, yeah
He said

I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is pretty fine (is pretty fine)

I took a trip to the year three thousand
This song had gone multi platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Michael Jackson
I took a trip to the year three thousand
This song had gone multi platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album, seventh album

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah, yeah
He said

I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is pretty fine (she's pretty fine)

He said
I've been to the year three thousand
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter is pretty fine
