HELD BY ME

When it's late and you're frightened
Through the thunder and lightning
Remember I'm thinking too
When you're scared baby phone in
Cause I am here for them moments
Remember I'm thinking too

When both of us seem sitting up sharing this feeling
You should be held by me
Can't stop feeling why you're not here with me sleeping
You should be held by me
We're separating for the night
And I keep looking over at the time
Dreaming myself to sleep
Pretending you're next to me

Every time that you worry
Every time that you're hurting
Remember I'm thinking too

When both of us seem sitting up sharing this feeling
You should be held by me
Can't stop feeling why you're not here with me sleeping
You should be held by me
We're separating for the night
And I keep looking over at the time
Dreaming myself to sleep
Pretending you're next to me
Yeah baby, there's a place for us
When nothing could ever amount to
Dreaming myself to sleep
Pretending you're next to me, yeah

We're separating for the night
And I keep looking over at the time
Dreaming myself to sleep
Pretending you're next to me
Yeah baby, there's a place for us
When nothing could ever amount to
Dreaming myself to sleep
Pretending you're next to me
