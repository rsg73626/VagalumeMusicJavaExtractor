JACK

Jack when we were younger
We hang out
We were inseperable
But now jack, you stole my thunder
Like my girl became my nemesis

He might be mr. popularity but
I wouldn't wanna change a thing about me

Uh oh oh don't take this as jealousy
Just cause you're with him and not me

He drinks Daniels at the bar, drives his daddys Jaguar
Rocking clothes with wills on the tag
Girl he's all up in your face
Wanna put him in his place
But right now i'd rather be Jack

Saying look can't you see
He's a dick compared to me
You should know he aint really all that

I still need you in my world
But he's got you as his girl
And that's why i'd rather be Jack

I can't delete his story
Wipe your smile from my memory
And forget you ever crushed me
By sleeping with the enemy

I think he's just another wanna be so
I wouldn't change a single thing about me

Uh oh oh you need to take this personally
'cos you're with him and not me

He drinks Daniels at the bar, drives his daddys Jaguar
Rocking clothes with wills on the tag
Girl he's all up in your face
Wanna put him in his place
But right now i'd rather be Jack

Saying look can't you see
He's a dick compared to me
You should know he aint really all that

I still need you in my world
But he's got you as his girl
And that's why i'd rather be Jack

So when you get tired of the same old lines, same old faces, places
There's always somewhere you can run

Pretty soon you will work it out
And I will be right here waiting
Right here waiting 'cus

Jack Jack is not right guy for
Jack Jack is not right guy for you
Jack Jack is not right guy for you

Jack Jack is not right guy for
Jack Jack is not right guy for you
Jack Jack is not right guy for you

He drinks Daniels at the bar, drives his daddys Jaguar
Rocking clothes with wills on the tag
Girl he's all up in your face
Wanna put him in his place
But right now i'd rather be Jack

Saying look can't you see
He's a dick compared to me
You should know he aint really all that

I still need you in my world
but he's got you as his girl
and that's why i'd rather be Jack

And that's why I'd rather be Jack
And that's why I'd rather be Jack
