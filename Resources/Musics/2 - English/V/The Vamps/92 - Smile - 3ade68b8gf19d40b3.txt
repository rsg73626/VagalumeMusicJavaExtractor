SMILE

Kick out the fuss
You know you get in my dear
Smile for me girl
Don't you shed a tear
Give me it all back
Cut me a bit of slack
Tell me you're never gonna leave me poor
I'm on the other side with the greener grass
Why girl?

So why don't you smile for me
And I'll take your picture
Make it last a lifetime
For it played in my eyes
Smile for me
I'll give it all back
In my oldest time
I'll make you mine
You got me so hung up
You got me so lovestruck

I'll be back around before you know it all
So wait for me and I'll wait for you to call
Give me all back
Cut me a bit of slack
Tell me you're never gonna leave me oh
I'm on the other side with the greener grass
Why girl?

So why don't you smile for me
Now I take your picture
Make it last a lifetime
For it played in my eyes
Smile for me
I'll give it all back
In my oldest time
I'll make you mine
You got me so hung up
You got me so love struck

Smile for me girl
Smile for me girl

Smile for me girl
So won't you Smile for me girl
Smile for me girl
And I'll take your picture
Cause I'm coming with you
Smile, smile, smile

Smile for me girl
Smile for me girl
Smile for me girl

Smile for me
And I'll take your picture
Make it last a lifetime
For it played in my eyes
Smile for me

You got me so hung up
You got me so lovestruck
