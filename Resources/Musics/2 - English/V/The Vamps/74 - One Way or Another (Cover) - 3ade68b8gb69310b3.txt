ONE WAY OR ANOTHER (COVER)

One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya

And will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down 
I'll see who's around 

A teenage dream 
So hard to be 
Every time she walks down the street 
Another girl in the neighbourhood 
But she was mine, she looks so good
I wanna hold you, wanna hokd you tight 
Get teenage kicks right through the night 
C'mon, Oh-oh-oh
C'mon, Oh oh 

One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm find see ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya

I wanna hold, wanna hold you tight 
Get teenage kicks right  through the night
C'mon
