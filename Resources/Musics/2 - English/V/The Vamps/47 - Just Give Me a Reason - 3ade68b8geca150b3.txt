JUST GIVE ME A REASON

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch
You fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh oh
Things you never say to me
Oh oh

Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love
Our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars
On our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything')
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happenin')

You've been havin' real bad dreams
Oh oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh oh

There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love
Our love
Oh, our love
Our love, oh

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars
On our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars
On our hearts
We're not broken just bent
So we can learn to love again
