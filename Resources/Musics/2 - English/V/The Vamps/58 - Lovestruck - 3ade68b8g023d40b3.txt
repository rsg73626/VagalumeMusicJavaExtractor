LOVESTRUCK

You, you

Excuse me miss
I don't ever do this
Must admit I'm pretty nervous
But just in case you say yes

I had to ask
If you already had dinner plans
I know you probably have a man
But if you happen to be unattached

I'd sign your name over the airways
Crash your couch and sleep on the stairway
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
I'm hung up, I'm shook up
I'm lovestruck

I'd wait all day just for a maybe
I'm trying to find a way to be worthy
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
I'm hung up, I'm shook up
I'm lovestruck

You, I'm lovestruck
You, I'm lovestruck

It might seem strange
You don't even know my name
But I've been watching you for days
Sitting in the same corner table of the same cafe

I heard wonderwall beating through your headphones
Cracked a little smile when you got the words wrong
Excuse me miss
I thought that you should know this

I'd sign your name over the airways
Crash your couch and sleep on the stairway
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
I'm hung up, I'm shook up
I'm lovestruck

I'd wait all day just for a maybe
I'm trying to find a way to be worthy
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
I'm hung up, I'm shook up
I'm lovestruck

I'd lay flowers at your feet oh oh oh oh
I'd be everything you need oh oh oh oh

You, I'm lovestruck
You, I'm lovestruck

I'm lovestruck

I'd sign your name over the airways
Crash your couch and sleep on the stairway
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
I'm hung up, I'm shook up
I'm lovestruck

I'd wait all day just for a maybe
I'm trying to find a way to be worthy
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
I'm hung up, I'm shook up
I'm lovestruck

You, I'm lovestruck
You, I'm lovestruck

I'm lovestruck, I'm lovestruck
