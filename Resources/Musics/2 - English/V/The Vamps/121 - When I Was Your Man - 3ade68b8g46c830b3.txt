WHEN I WAS YOUR MAN

Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Ooh!
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Ooh!

Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
I'm gonna get every time you spank the night

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey"
When you get back to where you're from

Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face
Then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did!

To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked, 'cause
What you don't understand is

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Cause you make feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
You make feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
