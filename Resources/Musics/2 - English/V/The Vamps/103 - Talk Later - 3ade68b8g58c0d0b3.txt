TALK LATER

Looking in the mirror
And all I see is liquor
Wishing I was somewhere else

Pushing through the bodies
'Cause I only want your
Body
Wish I didn't look like hell

I get confused
Putting labels on things makes them complicated
Don't think
Just do
When the music gets too loud
It's hard to say it

So can we talk later?
Then you can tell me what you want
When we ain't faded
'Cause right now there's smoke in our lungs
After we're naked
When your body says just what it wants
Can we talk, can we talk
 can we talk, can we talk?

Spending half my night
Reading all the signs
I thought you wanted someone else

But in the hotel lobby
You tell me that you want me
I wish I didn't look like hell

I get confused
Putting labels on things makes them complicated
Don't think
Just do
When the music gets too loud
It's hard to say it

So can we talk later?
Then you can tell me what you want
When we ain't faded
'Cause right now there's smoke in our lungs
After we're naked
When your body says just what it wants
Can we talk, can we talk
 can we talk, can we talk?

Can we talk talk talk

After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Under faded lights
Can we talk talk talk?

After the music dies
When were back at mine
Under faded lights

Looking in the mirror
My vision's getting clearer
So we should go somewhere else

Where can we talk later
And you can tell me what you want
If we're still faded
From all the smoke in our lungs
And we can get naked
And your body tell me more than once
Can we talk, can we talk
 can we talk, can we talk?

Can we talk talk talk

After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Under faded lights
Can we talk talk talk

After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Can we talk, can we talk
 can we talk, can we talk

Later?
