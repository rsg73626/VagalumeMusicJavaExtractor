TEQUILA

I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey or red wine
Champagne all night
Little scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

But when I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
Your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on the bible baby I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya

When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Play the same songs in my car
Baby your memory, it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
Your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on the bible baby I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya

When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila, whoa-oh

When I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt
Same one you wore when we were

When I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
Your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on the bible baby I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya

When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila, whoa-oh
