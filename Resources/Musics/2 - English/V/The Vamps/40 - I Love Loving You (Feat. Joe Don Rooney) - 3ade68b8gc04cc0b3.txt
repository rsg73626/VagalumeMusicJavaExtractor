I LOVE LOVING YOU (FEAT. JOE DON ROONEY)

I think it's in the way you move
Like you're living in the movies
But I don't know for sure
Or is it how you change your mind?
Like the wind in Oklahoma
The freedom I adore

Take me for all that I am and
Save me from all that you can and
I try my best to keep you strong
I'm tired but I cannot sleep when
I know you're waiting for me and
I swear to God I'll make it home

I'm gonna run to your door
And kiss them pretty lips of yours
And stare into your eyes so blue
Taking me to Heaven
With every beat of your heart
Groove so fine
The way your body moves with mine
I'm certain there's a sunrise
And the nights fall just like they do
I love loving you
I come back for you
I love loving you

I get the page you wrote for me
In Arizona our friends are sitting there
Those voices say I'm yours
Another day and I'm awake
A hotel call, I'm in La
Yeah, you're on my mind
Every minute of every day

Who says that we need a plan and
We'll speak when I'm in Japan and
I give it all to feel your skin
I'm tired but I cannot sleep when
I know you're waiting for me and
Help me God I'm wearing thin

I'm gonna run to your door
And kiss them pretty lips of yours
And stare into your eyes so blue
Taking me to Heaven
With every beat of your heart
Groove so fine
The way your body moves with mine
I'm certain there's a sunrise
And the nights fall just like they do
I love loving you
I love loving you
I come back for you, baby
Taking me to Heaven

I'm gonna run to your door
And kiss them pretty lips of yours
And stare into your eyes so blue
Taking me to Heaven
With every beat of your heart
Groove so fine
The way your body moves with mine
I'm certain there's a sunrise
And the nights fall just like they do
I love loving you
