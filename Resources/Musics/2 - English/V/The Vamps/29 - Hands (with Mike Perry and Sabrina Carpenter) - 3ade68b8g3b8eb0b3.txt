HANDS (WITH MIKE PERRY AND SABRINA CARPENTER)

Come on lay your hands
Your hands on me
We don't have to talk
Cause talk is cheap
In the dark silence so loud
You only gotta lay your hands on me

You say it in better way and
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
You say it in better way and
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah

I've been thinking about it
I've been thinking all night
Every time I try to learn
your body language
Never get it right
Just so I do rebate it
So I turn off the light
And we just drop that dress to the floor
We can talk until sunrise
I've been thinking about it
The way that you blow my mind
I've been thinking about it, all night

Come on lay your hands
Your hands on me
We don't have to talk
Cause talk is cheap
In the dark silence so loud
You only gotta lay your hands on me

You say it in better way and
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
You say it in better way and
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah

Don't tell me about it
Keep on blowing my mind
Cause your lips are made for kissing baby
So I put them on mine
No conversation
I would've been lying
So leave your shit at the door

Come on lay your hands
Your hands on me
We don't have to talk
Cause talk is cheap
In the dark silence so loud
You only gotta lay your hands on me

You say it in better way and
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
You say it in better way and
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
