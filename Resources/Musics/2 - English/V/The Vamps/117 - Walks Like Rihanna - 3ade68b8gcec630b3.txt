WALKS LIKE RIHANNA

Have you seen that girl
Have you seen her
She's the freakiest thing
You gotta meet her
You'll do whatever it takes to get her by your side

It's not the way she smiles
With a little laugh
It's not the way she looks
In a photograph
But all the boys, they crowd around

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

Have you seen that girl
Have you seen her
With the way she moves you'll want to kiss her
She'll be the girl of your dreams
If you can close your eyes

You can feel that beat when she's in the room
You can feel your heart going boom boom
And all the boys, they crowd around

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

Boom boom, boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom, boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom, boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom, boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom, boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom, boom boom boom
Our hearts go

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

She can't sing
She can't dance
But who cares
She walks like Rihanna

Walks like Rihanna (x3)
