LITTLE THINGS

Your hand fits in mine
Like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me

But I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
Yeah it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep
Though, it makes no sense to me

But I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
Yeah it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You'll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know
I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you
Oh...

I wont let these little(x12)
But I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
Yeah it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
(out of my mouth) 
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
Yeah it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
