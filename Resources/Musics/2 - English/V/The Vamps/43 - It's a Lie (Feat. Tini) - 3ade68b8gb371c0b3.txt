IT'S A LIE (FEAT. TINI)

[Brad]
A man had never been so good with words 
that come from my brain through my fingers
And onto the screens
Seems like a good idea to me
'Cause girl, I'm sure that all you want to know 
is that our song's playing on the radio 
at quarter past three
Seems like a good idea to me

And you call, so I answer
And you're mad, but there's laughter
Could we live, ever after?
Seems like a good idea to me

Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie
Go tell all of your girlfriends 
that I was just a waste of time
You know you kinda like it, 
every time I catch your eye
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie

[Tini]
Boy, I can't keep holding on this
And I don't play falling for your tricks
But before you go, it's only right I let you know
I heard our song playing so loud tonight
I rang by the wayside
By quarter past three
It seemed like a good idea to me

And you call, so I answer
And you're mad, but there's laughter
Could we live, ever after?
Seems like a good idea to me

Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie
Go tell all of your girlfriends 
that I was just a waste of time
You know you kinda like it, 
every time I catch your eye
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie

You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?
'Cause I know it's a lie
You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?

Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie
Go tell all of your girlfriends 
that I was just a waste of time
You know you kinda like it, 
every time I catch your eye
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie

You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?
'Cause I know it's a lie
You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?
'Cause I know it's a lie
