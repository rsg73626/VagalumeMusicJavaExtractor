LOVE IS EASY (FEAT. CARRIE HOPE FLETCHER)

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Today I? m laughing the clouds away
I hear what the flowers say
And drink every drop of rain
And I see places that I have been
And things that I? ve never seen
My side of the grass is green

Oh, I can? t believe that it's so simple
It feels so natural to me

If this is love then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love, then love completes me
Cause it feels like I? ve been missing you
A simple equation with no complications to leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
It? s the easiest thing to do

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Do you feel the way that I do?
Do I turn your grey skies blue
And make dirty streets look new?
And the birds sing
Tweedily tweet dee dee dee
Tweedily dee dee dee
And now I know exactly what they mean

Oh I can? t believe that it's so simple
It feels so natural to me

If this is love then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love then love completes me
Cause it feels like I? ve been missing you
A simple equation with no complications to leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
It? s the easiest thing to do

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
