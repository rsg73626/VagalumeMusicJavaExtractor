JUST MY TYPE

M-m-m-m-m-my more than meets the eye
To tell the truth would be a lie
I saw her out on Friday night, misunderstood
She's balling for a guy
That cigarette, it needs a light
Pluck up the courage and invite her nowhere good

Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
Need that "honey, won't you hold my hand"
Times like these, think of a true romance
But she's not ready for that

She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type
She's my device
I don't think twice
Oh I don't know why
She's what I like

But I, I, I love it
I, I, I love it
Love the way she plays with my head
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type

This person on repeat
Plays in my mind, won't let me sleep
She's not the one who's in my sheets
Cause she's not good
She defies all of my dreams
An expectation she won't meet
I'll pack my bags and try to leave
I wish I could

Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
Need that honey, won't you hold my hand
Times like these, think of a true romance
But she's not ready for that

She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type
She's my device
I don't think twice
Oh I don't know why
She's what I like

But I, I, I love it
I, I, I love it
Love the way she plays with my head
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type

More than meets the eye
To tell the truth would be a lie
I saw her out again last night, misunderstood
And I'll never be that guy
That cigarette still needs a light
And when I take you back to mine it's nothing good

Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
Need that honey, won't you hold my hand
Times like these, think of a true romance
But she's not ready for that

She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type
She's my device
I don't think twice
Oh I don't know why
She's what I like

But I, I, I love it
I, I, I love it
Love the way she plays with my head
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type

Oh she's just my type
Yeah she's got just what I like
And she's just my type
Oh yeah she's just my type
