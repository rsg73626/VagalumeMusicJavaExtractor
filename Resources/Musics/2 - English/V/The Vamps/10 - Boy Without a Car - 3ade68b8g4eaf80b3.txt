BOY WITHOUT A CAR

Pretty face, I wanna tell you something
But I'll just wait, while you keep me hanging on
And on, and on, your every word
It's 3 A. M., and we're just sat here talking
About your friends, but we don't care about them
At all, I just wanna swallow you up
I tried but no one keeps me close to you

And I'm wondering how we got this far
I'm just another boy without a car
Oh, how I wish that you could say you feel the same way
You always got me wanting more
I've never met a girl like you before
Oh, how I wish that you would stay with me
for another day

You're like the rain, I drown myself in ya
And there's no way, I'm leaving here without your
Hands, your eyes, that I see as mine
Why try when your like a ghost to me?

And I'm wondering how we got this far
I'm just another boy without a car
Oh, how I wish that you could say you feel the same way
You always got me wanting more
I've never met a girl like you before
Oh, how I wish that you would stay with me
for another day

I give my heart and my soul for yo-o-ou
Don't leave me high and dry, don't go-o-o
I give my heart and my soul for yo-o-ou

I'm wondering how we got this far
I'm just another boy without a car
Oh, how I wish that you would stay with me
for another day

And I'm wondering how we got this far
I'm just another boy without a car
Oh, how I wish that you could say you feel the same way
You always got me wanting more
I've never met a girl like you before
Oh, how I wish that you would stay with me
for another day
