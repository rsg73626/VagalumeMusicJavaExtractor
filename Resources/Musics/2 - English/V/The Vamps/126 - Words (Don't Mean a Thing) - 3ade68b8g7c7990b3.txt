WORDS (DON'T MEAN A THING)

How come when your near me
I have trouble speaking
It's like I always trip on my tongue
So I can never tell you
The things I think about you
There must be a million words 
But I'll be happy with just one

Are you feeling this connection?
'Cause I'm so tongue tied, tongue tied

But I could take you in my arms
Show you what I'm all about
I could give you just one kiss and you'll know 
(and you'll know)
If only I could make you see
All the things you do to me
'Cause we both know the words don't mean a thing
The words don't mean a thing
The words don't mean a thing

When I see you in the corridor
I stare down at the floor
Just so I don't have to look so dumb
I'm tying myself and asking but you won't come undone [?]
You don't even know me but I'm stuck under your thumb
So where do we go from here

How do I get your attention?
'Cause I'm so tongue tied, tongue tied

But I could take you in my arms
Show you what I'm all about
I could give you just one kiss and you'll know
(and you'll know)
If only I could make you see
All the things you do to me
'Cause we both know the word s don't mean a thing
The words don't mean a thing
The words don't mean a thing

It's here right on the tip of my tongue
A million words but I just need one, one, one, one

But I could take you in my arms
Show you what I'm all about
I could give you just one kiss and you'll know
(and you'll know)
If only I could make you see
All the things you do to me
'Cause we both know the words don't mean a thing
The words don't mean a thing
(are you feeling this connection)
The words don't mean a thing
(how can I get your attention?)

Are you feeling this connection
'Cause I'm so tongue tied, tongue tied
