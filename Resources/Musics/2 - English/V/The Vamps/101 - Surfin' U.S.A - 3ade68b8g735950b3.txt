SURFIN' U.S.A

If everybody had an ocean
Across the Usa
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like California

You'd seem 'em wearing their baggies
Huarachi sandals too
A bushy bushy blonde hairdo
Surfin' Usa

You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
Ventura County line
Santa Cruz and Trestle
Australia's Narrabeen
All over Manhattan
And down Doheny Way
'Cause everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' Usa

We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June

We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on surfari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' Usa

Haggerties and Swamies
Pacific Palisades
San Onofre and Sunset
Redondo Beach La
All over La Jolla
At Wa'imea Bay
'Cause everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' Usa

Haggerties and Swamies
