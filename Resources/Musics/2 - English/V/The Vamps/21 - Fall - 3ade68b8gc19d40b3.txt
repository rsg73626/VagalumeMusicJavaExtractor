FALL

Didn't know you were ready, ready for it all
Never said that you'd get me, you never let me know
If I knew then what I know

Now you see that you're ready, now you wanna go
But darling, please don't tempt me
I've gotta take control
Turn the lights way down low

Can't take my eyes off
Can't take my hands off 
You

For the first time
Just Fall
Our hearts are racing
Fall
Why did we wait so long?
We Just Fall
Hold on, hold on, hold on

The night we met under starlight, after the storm
And knew that we would be alright
Your skin feels soft and warm
Now let's go round one more time

Can't take my eyes off
Can't take my hands 
Off you

And for the first time
Just Fall
Our hearts are racing
Fall
Why did we wait so long?
We Just Fall
Hold on, hold on, hold on

You say you're ready, ready to go
I say I'm ready, why don't we just fall?
You say you're ready, ready to go
I say I'm ready, why don't we just fall?

For the first time
Just Fall
Our hearts are racing
Fall
Why did we wait so long?
We Just Fall
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Just Fall
Our hearts are racing
Fall
Why did we wait so long?
We Just Fall
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on
