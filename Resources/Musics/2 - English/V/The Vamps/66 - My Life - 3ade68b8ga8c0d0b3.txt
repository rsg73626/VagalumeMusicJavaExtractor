MY LIFE

Hooked like its nicotine
 the devils been under my skin
Now that she had a taste
 she's back again for one more sin
Tryna get on the scene
Jumping from a to z
Always thought you were different
You're no different

Ha, please

Said you'd stay but when the magic died
You were looking for the one on the rise
Pick me up and show me your behind
And now you only want a piece of my life
I'm doing fine without you in my life
I'm doing fine without
You in my life

Those vicious eyes make those lies
 look so innocent
Whispering sweet things every evening
 just to pay your rent

Tryna get on the scene
Jumping from a to z
Always thought you were different
You're no different

Ha, please

Said you'd stay but when the magic died
You were looking for the one on the rise
Pick me up and show me your behind
And now you only want a piece of my life
I'm doing fine without you in my life
I'm doing fine without
You in my life

Tryna get on the scene
Jumping from a to z
Always thought you were different
You're no different

Ha, please

Said you'd stay but when the magic died
You were looking for the one on the rise
Pick me up and show me your behind
And now you only want a piece of my life
I'm doing fine without you in my life
I'm doing fine without
You in my life
Im doing fine without you in my life
Im doing fine without
You in my life
