HIDEAWAY

You kick me out
But as I'm driving away
You track me down
And then you beg me to stay

Your love is like a rollercoaster
Ain't black or white, it's fifty shades of grey
We're doing things we're not supposed to
Then you don't call me for days

But now it's four in the morning
And I'm losing my mind
Can't get to sleep
Thinking maybe you're with some other guy
Call me to speak over darling
I'm just sick of your lies
So unless you got something to say
I'll hideaway
Oh no, no
I'll hideaway

Drive outta town
'Cause you needed some space
I can't hear a sound
But all I see is your face

Your love is like a rollercoaster
Ain't black or white, it's fifty shades of grey
We're doing things we're not supposed to
Then you don't call me for days

But now it's four in the morning
And I'm losing my mind
Can't get to sleep
Thinking maybe you're with some other guy
Call me to speak over darling
I'm just sick of your lies
So unless you got something to say
I'll hideaway
Oh no, no
I'll hideaway
I'll hideaway
Oh no, no
I'll hideaway

Your love is like a rollercoaster
Ain't black or white, it's fifty shades of grey
We're doing things we're not supposed to
Then you don't call me for days

But now it's four in the morning
And I'm losing my mind
Can't get to sleep
Thinking maybe you're with some other guy
Call me to speak over darling
I'm just sick of your lies
So unless you got something to say
I'll hideaway
Oh no, no
I'll hideaway
I'll hideaway
Oh no, no
I'll hideaway
