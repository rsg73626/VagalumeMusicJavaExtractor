SHE LOOKS SO PERFECT

Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey

Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else

But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now

If you don't swim
You'll drown
But don't move
Honey

She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I've got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey Hey!
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey

Let's get out
Let's get out

Cause this deadbeat towns only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
Cause all I really want is you

She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey Hey!
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey

She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I've got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey Hey!
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey

She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Hey
Your lipstick stain is a work of art (hey)
I've got your name tattooed in an arrow heart (hey)
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey)
Hey
