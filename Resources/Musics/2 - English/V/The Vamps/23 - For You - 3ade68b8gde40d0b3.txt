FOR YOU

Summer comes and when it fades
You're in that little dress again, yeah
It's like a knife that cuts deep
And I can't bear to think
 About just how close we used to be
It keeps me up,
 I can't sleep

All my friends were lost
 But I was found
Then I threw it away
 When we walked on hollow ground

But I will run back into your arms
No matter where we are,
 If you need me to
If you still got some space in your heart
I would tear this world apart for your

We needed space
 And a little time
Girl I hope you change your mind
And come back to me
Remember all the mornings
 You would make me late
I couldn't bare to leave you
When you looked at me
 The way you do

All my friends were lost
 But I was found, yeah
Then I threw it away
When we walked on hollow ground, yeah

But I will run back into your arms
No matter where we are,
 If you need me to
If you still got some space in your heart
I would tear this world apart for you
You're the star
 That makes my heart burn brighter
I would walk through the fire for you, for you

And if I'm there too late, mmh, yes
A couple things I got to say

But I will run back into your arms
No matter where we are,
 If you need me to
If you still got some space in your heart
I would tear this world apart for you
You're the star
 That makes my heart burn brighter
I would walk through the fire for you, for you
You're the star
 That makes my heart burn brighter
I would walk through the fire for you, for you
