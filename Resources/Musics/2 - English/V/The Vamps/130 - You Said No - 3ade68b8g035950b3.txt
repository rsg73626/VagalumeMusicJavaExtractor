YOU SAID NO

You're so fit and you know it
And I only dream of you
'Cause my life's such a bitch
But you can change it

Maybe you'll need
Somebody just like me
Don't turn me down
'Cause I've got no car
And I've got no money

I asked you to dance at the disco but you said "no"
The whole world was watching and laughing
On the day that I crashed and burned
At your feet

Since the day when you dissed me
I'm feeling so pathetic
'Cause the guys wanna ditch me
And it's all because of
You and your friends laughing at me now
You think that I'm nothing
Ask your sister what you're missing

I asked you to dance at the disco but you said "no"
The whole world was watching and laughing
On the day that I crashed and burned
At your feet

Maybe you think that you're too good for me
And tonight when you get home you're gonna see
I know, I've got
Something better than you baby

Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

I asked you to dance at the disco but you said "no"
The whole world was watching and laughing
On the day that
I asked you to dance at the disco but you said "no"
The whole world was watching and laughing
On the day that I crashed and burned
At your feet
