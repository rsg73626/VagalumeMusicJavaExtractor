SHE WAS THE ONE

Tell me you love me
Tell me you care
But I know you won't be there

I thought you were sleeping
Do you feel the same?
Oh I bet you can't complain
About that at all

So give me it all and I'll give it right back
And show you the bottom of this bottle
We can pick up where we left off
Tomorrow

She was the one who got away
She was the one who I never got to say
How much I miss your touch

She was the one who meant the most
She was the one who I kept close
Amongst it all, just let's fall

They'll tell you it's easy
And you can't deny
That we'll still stay up all night
What a waste of time

So give me it all and i'll give it right back
And show you the bottom of this bottle
We can pick up where we left off
Tomorrow

She was the one who got away
She was the one who I never got to say
How much I miss your touch

She was the one who meant the most
She was the one who I kept close
Amongst it all, just let's fall

Tell me it'll be ok
Tell me it'll all fade away

I've walked for miles and I haven't even got that far
Told you my secrets
And I promise we won't leave this scarred
'Cause I've got nothing, nothing but a broken heart

Never thought it would ever end that way
Second guessing, girl I got led astray
Could you come back to me one day

She was the one who got away
She was the one who I never got to say
How much I miss your touch

She was the one who meant the most
She was the one who I kept close
Amongst it all, just let's fall
One day
