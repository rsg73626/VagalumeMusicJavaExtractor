BEST SONG EVER

Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

I said, can you give it back to me?
She said, never in your wildest dreams

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went
Oh, oh, oh
I think it went
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it went
Ohh
Woo!

Said her name was georgia rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth
But she kissed me like she meant it

I said, can I take you home with me?
She said, never in your wildest dreams

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went
Oh, oh, oh
I think it went
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it went
Ohh
Woo!

You know, I know you know
I'll remember you
I know, you know I know
You'll remember me

You know, I know you know
I'll remember you
I know, you know I hope
You'll remember how we danced
How we danced

One, two
One, two, three

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went
Oh, oh, oh
I think it went
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it went
Ohh
Woo!

Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
