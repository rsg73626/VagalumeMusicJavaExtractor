STOLEN MOMENTS

You tell me I'm a friend
But confused minds and blurred lines
Have brought it to an end
And all that is left now is where it's going to end
And I don't know, no

Used to be enough, to have you around me
Before we said too much
Now you can't be around me
Cause now you find it hard
Not to drop your guard
Oh, not to drop your guard

I'm breaking in to steal it all
And I'll escape with every stolen moment
That I spend with you
Call me a thief, girl if you want
But piece by piece I'll take each stolen moment

There's no way to defend
When you pull all the walls down, it's harder to pretend
But I don't want it all now
I need it even more
Every time you go
I hate to watch you, go

I'm breaking in to steal it all
And I'll escape with every stolen moment
That I spend with you
Call me a thief, girl if you want
But piece by piece I'll take each stolen moment
That I spend with you

We're the puzzle I can't fix
Million pieces still missing
When I look at you and me, I still can't tell what this is
But it's out of my control
Love's a hole
You say you don't wanna fall in
But you keep falling

I'm breaking in to steal it all
And I'll escape with every stolen moment
That I spend with you
Call me a thief, girl if you want
But piece by piece I'll take each stolen moment
That I spend with you
Oh, that I spend with you
Oh, that I spend with you, eh
That I spend with you
That I spend with you
