AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning

Hey, now, you know, girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

As long as you love me
As long as you love me

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your "H. O. V. A. "
You can be my "Destiny's Child" on scene, girl

So don't stress and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

As long as you love me
As long as you love me

Love me
As long as you love me girl, no

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

As long as you love me
As long as you love me

As long as you love me
As long as you love me, girl
As long as you do
As long as you love me
