GOLDEN

I been fooled
Too many times
Always feel a little black and white lines

I'm tired enough
And of the line
Told myself that I would get it right this time

When you walk in through the door
I couldn't want you more
When you let your hair down, hair down
So tell me what to say
I wanna play your game
Here we go again now, again now

The way you move has
Got me losing it
Don't you know that you are golden, golden
No matter where we go
You keep me on my toes
Don't you know that you are golden, golden

Woah, woah, woah

So I might just change some tracks
The disc you made my heart and there's no turning back
We're close enough, close enough to touch
I guess you like my sight and I'm not giving up

You had me from day one
Pulled the trigger now I'm done
Got my heart on lock down, lock down
We're playing cat and mouse
I'm trying to work you out
No I don't get you, get you

The way you move has
Got me losing it
Don't you know that you are golden, golden
No matter where we go
You keep me on my toes
Don't you know that you are golden, golden

I don't think you know how lovely you are
Get outta my head
Woah
Keep doing what you do
Cause I'm a fool for you
Don't you know that you are golden, golden

I don't know what you running from
Or where you're heading to no
I don't know what you running from
Or where you're heading to no

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

The way you move has
Got me losing it
Don't you know that you are golden, golden
No matter where we go
You keep me on my toes
Don't you know that you are golden, golden

I don't think you know how lovely you are
Get outta my head
Woah
Keep doing what you do
Cause I'm a fool for you
Don't you know that you are golden, golden
