LAST NIGHT

Oh oh oh oh

I hold my hands up high
And throw my glass into the sky
When the morning comes
We'll never see the sun
Until the wall close in
Then let's just start it all again
That's when the evening comes
Oh yeah the evening comes

Woah woah
No we're not going home tonight
Wake up when the stars are shining
We'll do it all, we'll do it all
We'll do it again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
But my head don't feel so right
What the hell happened last night
Yeah last night when we were dancing
Singing all our favourite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We have last night

Let's shut this party down
And pull this building to the ground
Yeah girl let's live it up
One night is all we got
Let's dance until we die
Nobody's going home tonight
This kiss could be our last
C'mon and raise your glass

Woah woah
No we're not going home tonight
Wake up when the stars are shining
We'll do it all, we'll do it all
We'll do it again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
But my head don't feel so right
What the hell happened last night
Yeah last night when we were dancing
Singing all our favourite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We have last night

Do it all again
Do it all again
So tell your friend to tell a friend
To bring another friend
Do it all again
Do it all again
By the end of tonight
We can't help it

Do it all again
Do it all again
So tell your friend to tell a friend
To bring another fried
Do it all again
Do it all again
By the end of tonight

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
Wooaah wooaah
What the hell happened last night
Yeah last night when we were dancing (we were dancing)
Singing all our favourite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We have last night

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
But my head don't feel so right
What the hell happened last night
Yeah last night when we were dancing
Singing all our favourite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We have last night
