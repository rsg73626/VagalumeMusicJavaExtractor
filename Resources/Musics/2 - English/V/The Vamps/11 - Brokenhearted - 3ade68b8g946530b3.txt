BROKENHEARTED

You're not the girl I used to know
How the hell did you get so cold
I bet you kick yourself to know
Where I been since you let me go, yeah
Now you wanna be with me, yeah
But you let your colours show
It's a long way home

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now tables turned, lessons learned
You got burnt, yeah
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke... brokenhearted

La la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la

I was standing in the dark girl
But now I'm in control
When we're million miles apart
Tell me why you sold your soul
Cause now you are the lonely one
Since you let your colours show
Baby it's a long way home

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now tables turned, lessons learned
You got burnt, yeah
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke... brokenhearted

La la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
