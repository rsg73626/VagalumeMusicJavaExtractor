MILLION WORDS

All the times that it slipped out my dimension
That you're the one I need and if I forgot to tell you
I was wrong to ever doubt it and you're all I think about, yeah
There's a million words I shoulda said
I remember you were standing in my doorway
And the words were on my lips
That you never looked so beautiful
Oh just to be near you, don't you know how good that feels?
These are all the things I should've said

Did I miss my chance? Is it too late to say?

Now I'm half a world away from you
But you're always on my mind
There's a million words that I could've said
That you might still be mine
And if there's someone where I used to be
I hope he tells you every day
The million words that I should've said
I wish I could tell you, always

When you were mine, did I push you far away?
Blamed this whole weight on my shoulders bearing down on me
But then I only had to see you
Don't you know how good that feels?
These are all the words I should've sent

Did I miss my chance? Is it too late to say?

Now I'm half a world away from you
But you're always on my mind
There's a million words that I could've said
That you might still be mine
And if there's someone where I used to be
I hope he tells you every day
The million words that I should've said
I wish I could tell you, always

And if I could only catch your eye and throw a smile
Maybe I could stop to say what's screaming in my mind
You should know that what I want to say could take all night or my whole life
Do I get a second chance to make you mine tonight?

Now I'm half a world away from you
But you're always on my mind
There's a million words that I could've said
That you might still be mine
And if I ever get the chance again
I would tell you every day
With the million words that I should've said
I wish I could tell you, always
Always, always
Always, always
