COMING HOME

Of course I get lonely, I guess I ain't old me
I'm sick and I'm tired of getting used up and tossed in the side
I hate this hotel room, four walls that stop me from getting to you
I'm hoping that someday we can run away-way from it all

But I promise I'll be back soon
And a voice through a phone ain't the same, it's true
Give me time and I'll give you
Every drop of mine

Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
Cause baby there is nothing that I want more
Than to hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something,
I miss you more then you'll ever know and I'm coming home

It's been 6 weeks
But how could I ever forget your face?
I find it so cute when you think
There's ever been anyone but you

I know I said I promise I'll be back soon
Just a couple more days we can get through
But give me time and I'll give you
Every drop of mine

Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
Cause baby there is nothing that I want more
Than to hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something,
I miss you more then you'll ever know and I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Oh tomorrow feels like a lifetime away
So why don't you stay right here?
Cause my arms were made for you tonight
Lie in, skin to my skin

Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
Cause baby there is nothing that I want more
To hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something, I miss you more then you'll ever know,
Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
Cause baby there's nothing that I want more
Then to hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something,
I miss you more then you'll ever know and I'm coming home
