ALL NIGHT (FEAT. MATOMA)

I've been up all night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Sometimes I tend to lose myself
When I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right
But I guess that's how it goes
Ever since you came here now
Can nobody hold me down now?
You show me how to find myself
When I needed it the most

I've been up all night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay
As long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

I'll never gonna find my way
If I don't learn to let go
The past is the past, today is today
And there's things I can't control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I've been waiting for you way too long
Would you come and take me home?

Oh, oh I, oh
Will pray it is another dream
Can you, you
Wake me up before you leave

I've been up all night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay
As long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Oh as long as I'm with you
Oh cause as long as I'm with you
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
