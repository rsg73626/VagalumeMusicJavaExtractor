WRITTEN OFF

I will stand here with my friends
And I'll get written off
We will laugh and learn to rest when we're older
Like a film without an end
Will we just play pretend
Whatever time we've all get left
Let's get written of again

When I wake up next to you
I hope that everything I do
It would break your rules
It's like I'm still at school
You can't say I didn't try
I'm scared to fall asleep at night
I'm scared of what you'll do if I don't have my eyes

It's a long way to follow you girl
When I know that our love will sink like stones

I will stand here with my friends
And I'll get written off
We will laugh and learn to rest when we're older
Like a film without an end
Will we just play pretend
Whatever time we've all get left
Let's get written of again

My friends will say I've lost my mind
But keep on asking all the time
When will I get my life and stop living a lie
What they never seem to see
Is that she's always stalking me
Steal my camera, my phone, my keys

It's a long way to follow you girl
When I know that our love will sink like stones
I't's a long time since I've known home
And I know that this road will twist and turn

I will stand here with my friends
And I'll get written off
We will laugh and learn to rest when we're older
Like a film without an end
Will we just play pretend
Whatever time we've all get left
Let's get written of again

I don't like the way she plays
It's in her mind, and she just sings my love
Oh, she's a sinner
She's not the kind of girl who wants to go and save the world
She light it up
And watch it burn

will stand here with my friends
And I'll get written off
We will laugh and learn to rest when we're older
Like a film without an end
Will we just play pretend
Whatever time we've all get left
Let's get written of again

Written off again
