ROCKIN' ROBIN

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin, (yeah)
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go

Rockin' robin, (wow)
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand
Started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol

Rockin' robin, (oh)
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin, (yeah)
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
