COME GRIND WITH ME

So give me one line
Promise you will get the best times
All you gotta do is let go
I'm the captain let me rock your boat
You can be my sunshine (sunshine)
Let me watch you do the dutty wine (dutty wine)
Come on baby let me let go
You wanna watch me watch you get low

And I can make this unforgettable
You will learn it's irresistible (oh no he didn't)
Yes I did (no he didn't)
Well, yes I did
And I can make this unregretable
You won't see it unpredictable (oh no he didn't)
Yes I did (no he didn't)
Yes I did

So come grind with me
So come grind with me
So come grind with me
So come grind with me

I wanna see you back it up
This love's a game so come on let's play
You don't have to remember my name
I just wanna see you hate me, then love me, resent me then touch me
So touch√©, I didn't think you had it in you
I just wanna see you hate me, then love me, resent me then touch me
Hate me then love me, resent me then touch me

And I can make this unforgettable
You will learn it's irresistible (oh no he didn't)
Yes I did (no he didn't)
Well, yes I did
And I can make this unregretable
You won't see it unpredictable (oh no he didn't)
Yes I did (no he didn't)
Yes I did

So come grind with me
So come grind with me
So come grind with me
So come grind with me

And I can make this unforgettable
You will learn it's irresistible

And I can make this unregretable
You won't see it unpredictable (oh no he didn't)
Yes I did (no he didn't)
Yes I did

So come grind with me
So come grind with me
So come grind with me
So come grind with me
