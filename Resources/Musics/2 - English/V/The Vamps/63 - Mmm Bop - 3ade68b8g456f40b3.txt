MMM BOP

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
Oh so hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care, oh care

In an mmbop they're gone

Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows
It's a secret no one knows

In an mmbop they're gone. In an mmbop they're not there
In an mmbop they're gone. In an mmbop they're not there
Until you lose your hair. But you don't care

Can you tell me? No you can't 'cause you don't know
Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow
No you can't 'cause you don't know
Can you tell me if it's going to be a daisy or a rose
You say you can but you don't know
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow
No you can't 'cause you don't know
Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know
You say you can but you don't know
Don't know
