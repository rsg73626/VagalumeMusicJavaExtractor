HIGH HOPES

Woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh

Well I met you yesterday
You took my breath away
And I kinda like the way that you're so damn unpredictable

That was just history
It turned into you and me
It happened so easily, like I'm livin' some kind of miracle

The world keeps spinning
It won't stop, it's just beginning

Cause I got high hopes, high hopes
High hopes for me and you
And when we grow old, I'll say "I told you so"
Cause I got high (high, high) hopes

Woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh

I can move in with you
And we could get married too
Go on our honeymoon
Maybe we should finish this coffee first

It might sound a little weird
It's like I've known you for years
So every word you hear might just sound a little over rehearsed

The world keeps spinning
It won't stop, it's just beginning

Cause I got high hopes, high hopes
High hopes for me and you
And when we grow old, I'll say "I told you so"
Cause I got high (high, high) hopes

Woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh

Ba ba ba ba ba bada, ba ba ba ba ba bada, ahh
High hopes
Ba ba ba ba ba bada, ba ba ba ba ba bada

The word keeps spinning
It wont stop, it's just beginning

Cause I got high hopes, high hopes
High hopes for me and you, (for me and you yeah baby)
When we grow old, I'll say "I told you so. "
Cause I got high, (high, high)
I got high hopes, high hopes
High hopes for me and you, (for me and you yeah baby)
When we grow old, I'll say "I told you so. "
Cause I got high (high, high) hopes

Woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-ooh

High hopes!
