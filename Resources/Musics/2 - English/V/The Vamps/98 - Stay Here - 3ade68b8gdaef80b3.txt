STAY HERE

Three am we ain't got no sleep
Lying next to me your feet tangled in my feet
Gonna like it
Waking up we've gotten used to our breath
Scoot over here baby come give me a kiss
Gonna like it, did you like it

Let's never move from in these sheets
We'll stay inside the castles we built underneath
Cause I've been looking for a queen
Are you free next week?

I'm in love with the way
You brush your hair off your face
Look to me and say
“Can we stay here, baby stay here”
Say I love you again
We carry on watching friends
With your head on my chest
Can we stay here, baby stay here with you
Stay here, can I stay here with you

Seven am and you're making me late for work
I gotta call in sick I gotta bad case of
The hottest girlfriend
In the world and I don't
Wanna move today
I'm gonna stay right here
Slow the day away
Hear you whisper in my ear
Did you like it did you like it

Let's never move from in these sheets
We'll stay inside the castles we built underneath
Cause I've been looking for a queen
You look like her to me

I'm in love with the way
You brush your hair off your face
Look to me and say
“Can we stay here, baby stay here”
Say I love you again
We carry on watching friends
With your head on my chest
Can we stay here, baby stay here with you
Stay here, if I can stay here with you

I can't stand the way
You keep on thinking I'll walk away
Don't you know you're my baby
And I'm staying, yeah I'm staying
And so does for me
Can't you stop with the jokes please
Cause I tell you I ain't gonna leave
I'm staying, I'm staying
I'm staying

Cause I'm in love with the way
You brush your hair off your face
Look to me and say
“Can we stay here, baby stay here”
Say I love you again
We carry on watching friends
With your head on my chest
Can we stay here, baby stay here with you

Baby stay here
Baby stay here
With you
