HIGHER

Does it hit like a bullet, my darling
Whenever you hear that song?
Does it take you a moment to realise
All that you knew is gone?

Does it feel like the seconds are hours?
Has the clock frozen in time?
Do you tell everyone whose around you
That love ruins your heart with its lies?
Do you wait until you can pretend
You're okay and it starts again?

If everything's changing I need you to know
That the hardest decision
Was letting you go
I'm searching for moments that we shared before
When you took me higher, higher
You took me higher, higher
You took me higher, higher

One hundred and sixty-eight hours
Since I stepped off that train
And for the questions
I don't have the answers
But nothing I feel is the same
No nothing is left I'm to blame

If everything's changing I need you to know
That the hardest decision
Was letting you go
I'm searching for moments
That we shared before
I clung to the memory how you came to me
I'm counting the hours like I watched you sleep
No nothing else matters like you did for me
When you took me higher, higher
You took me higher, higher
You took me higher, higher
Whoa whoa whoa

And I switch off, burn out
Give up, I shout out
All of the days became one
And I walk home alone
I hide away from my phone
Nothing is right now you're gone

If everything's changing I need you to know
That the hardest decision
Was letting you go
I'm searching for moments that we shared before
I clung to the memory how you came to me
I'm counting the hours like I watched you sleep
No nothing else matters like you did for me
When you took me higher, higher
You took me higher, higher
You took me higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
