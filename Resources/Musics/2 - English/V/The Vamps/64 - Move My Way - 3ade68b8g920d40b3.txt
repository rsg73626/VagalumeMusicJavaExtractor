MOVE MY WAY

I wake to find you're already up now
Pull back the curtain
Smell the sweet refreshment
Of a brand new day

All out of bed at 11:15
Took in the perfect serenity you
Give me, every day

The telephone rings out
but you've got no worries
You say "forget the world
And listen now"

So do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And baby I don't wanna change

Should I should I should I,should I should
I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can't
We just stay the same

Now I'm head over heels and
breaking my back
Reaching for one last chance
to take it away with one last dance
I promise, tonight's your dream

Now I don't know the words
don't know the place
But I'm sure
That every moment I'll make it yours
Cause you're the only one I know
Feeling this way

The telephone rings out
but you've got no worries
You say "forget the world
And listen now"

So do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And baby I don't wanna change

Should I should I should I,should I should
I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can't
We just stay the same

So do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And baby I don't wanna change

Should I should I should I,should I should
I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can't
We just stay the same

No

So do do, do do, do do do
You wanna
You wanna move my way
And baby I don't wanna change

Should I should I should I,should I should
I wanna
I wanna feel this way
So tell me why can't
We just stay the same
