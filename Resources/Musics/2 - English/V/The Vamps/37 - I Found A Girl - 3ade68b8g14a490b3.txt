I FOUND A GIRL

This girl moved to my apartment
 (one day)
One look at her
 And my heart was stopping (heartbreak)
I did whatever she was asking
She said "maybe later catch
 You in the elevator"

A couple days we got to hanging
 (real close)
Turns out she wasn't even taken
 (no no)
I made a move she said
 "baby you're mistaken,
 I'm not into bacon "

She got that smile
 And that body is to die for
One of a kind
 And that's why it makes me cry

Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why? tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl

I should've know to walk away then
I should've left that alone
But when she call me
 On the phone we'll be hanging again
I knew the premise of friends
But now she only talks of me
 About some other woman, she says:

She got that smile
 And that body is to die for
One of a kind
 And that's why it makes me cry

Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said, that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why? tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh,
 Oh oh oh, oh (I found a girl)
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh


I can't believe
 I met somebody like you
And now I feel like I'm fooled
And that to me is so cruel
I can't believe it
 I just think like a man
That you just wanted me bad
But you had different plans


Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said, that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why? tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl

I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said, that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why? tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl
