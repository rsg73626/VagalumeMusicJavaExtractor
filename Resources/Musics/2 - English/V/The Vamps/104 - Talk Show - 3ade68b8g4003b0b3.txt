TALK SHOW

I play a song loud
To drown out the pain
'Cause no medication
is doing the trick quite the same
How is someone your loved
Now someone you hate?
But I hope you're still doing okay

The couples I see that are on the tv
The things they repeat
but that don't work for me

I'm looking at pictures
They don't
Make me feel
Better, better
Someone call a doctor
Can he
Make me forget her
Get her
Where do I go?
My last resort is talk show
I'm ripping up pictures
I hope it makes me feel better

All the dark clouds
They roam over me
Loving is hurting
It's perfect if you're on the other side of the screen
So how can I live without you in my life?
I guess I will find out, find out, find out, find out
And this will all become a memory

The couples I see that are on the tv
The things they repeat
but that don't work for me

I'm looking at pictures
They don't
Make me feel
Better, better
Someone call a doctor
Can he
Make me forget her
Get her
Where do I go?
My last resort is talk show
I'm ripping up pictures
I hope it makes me feel better

Sometimes I get drunk
Forget about love
Then I feel all alright
Then the morning comes
Back to square one
Back to normal life

Get up, get up
I keep telling myself
Get up, get up
Before I rip my heart out
Get up, get up
I keep telling myself
Telling myself

I'm looking at pictures
They don't
Make me feel
Better, better
Someone call a doctor
Can he
Make me forget her
Get her
Where do I go?
My last resort is talk show
I'm ripping up pictures
I hope it makes me feel better
