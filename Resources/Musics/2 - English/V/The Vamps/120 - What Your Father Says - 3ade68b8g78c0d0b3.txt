WHAT YOUR FATHER SAYS

Is it a bad time to tell you I love you
When I'm watching you walk away?
Bad time to tell you I need you
When he's made up his mind again

Don't be cruel to me
All I do is believe

That it's a bad time to tell you to trust me
When I'm getting my story straight
A bad time to kick up a fuss
When it's only ever me to blame
You're confused about me

(All the rumours getting through
'Cause he heard that I'm bad news, oh baby)

Forget what your father says
I'm throwing stones at your windowpane
'Cause a boy like me and a girl like you
Got no degrees and a lot to prove
Says that you're wrong for me
Forget what your father says

Is it the good times
 sneak in the back door
When your dad's at work all day?
A good time to lean in and kiss you
When he's not up in your face

You're confused about me
All the rumours getting through
'Cause he heard that I'm bad news, oh baby

Forget what your father says
I'm throwing stones at your windowpane
'Cause a boy like me and a girl like you
Got no degrees and a lot to prove
Says that you're wrong for me
Forget what your father says

Told me he don't like my hair
 he don't like my music
Told me that I better run otherwise he'll lose it
And if I want his daughter's love
 I better start praying
So all that I keep saying to her

Forget what your father says
I'm throwing stones at your windowpane
'Cause a boy like me and a girl like you
Got no degrees and a lot to prove
Says that you're wrong for me

Forget what your father says
I'm throwing stones at your windowpane
'Cause a boy like me and a girl like you
Got no degrees and a lot to prove
Says that you're wrong for me
Forget what your father says
Forget what your father says
Forget what your father says
