WE ARE NEVER EVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER

I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying "this is it I've had enough"
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
What?

Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you", we break up, you call me, I love you

Uh uh uh uh uh
He call me up again last night
But uh uh uh uh uh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some Indie record that's much cooler than mine

Uh uh uh uh uh
He call me up again last night
But uh uh uh uh uh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together, yeah

Uh uh uh uh uh
No, yeah yeah
Getting back together, yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh
No, you go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh
Never ever getting back together
