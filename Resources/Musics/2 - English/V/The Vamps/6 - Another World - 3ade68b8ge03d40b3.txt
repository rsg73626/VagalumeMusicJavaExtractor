ANOTHER WORLD

People like to talk
But I can't understand a word
They threw us to the wolves
But I can't say I'm stronger now

Now my back's against the wall
I'm drifting door to door
No I can't rest

We just lay awake
But tell me now was that just one big
Stupid mistake
'Cause I can't get you off my mind
I'm drifting day to day
I just stay awake
No I can't sleep

I close my eyes
And you are here with me tonight

In another world
Oh I know, I know, I know that
You would be my girl
And nothing would tear us apart

Another universe
The stars would light the way
For just the two of us

Nothing would tear us apart [oh woah]
In another world [oh woah]
Just the two of us [oh woah]

A special place in time
I put it in a bottle
I'll go back there in my mind
I'm up above the clouds

Until I come crashing back to earth
'Cause I know this can work
'Cause when it hurts

I close my eyes
And you are here with me tonight, tonight

In another world
Oh I know, I know, I know that
You would be my girl
And nothing would tear us apart

Another universe
The stars would light the way
For just the two of us

Nothing would tear us apart [oh woah]
In another world [oh woah]
Just the two of us [oh woah]

I just close my eyes
And you're here with me tonight
And nothing will tear us apart

I just close my eyes
Can't get you off my mind
And nothing will tear us apart

In another world
The stars would light the way
For just the two of us
Nothing would tear us apart

People like to talk
But I can't understand a word
They threw us to the wolves
