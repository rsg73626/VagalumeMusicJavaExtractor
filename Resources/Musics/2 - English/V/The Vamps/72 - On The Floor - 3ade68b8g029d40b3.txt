ON THE FLOOR

I, I don't wanna say goodnight
But I know if I come inside
That I'd be playing with your heart and with your mind
It's something that I always do
But if I tell you from the get-go, I can let go
And I'll leave it up to you

So open up the door
I know that you can't wait
Till our clothes are on the floor,
On the floor, on the floor

And I will take you there
If you let me take you
To places that you've never been, never been before
And I love that dress you wear,
But it's whatever!
'Cause I think that it would look much better,
On the floor, on the floor

Don't call me 20 times a day,
Running outta things to say
Let's not get too obsessed to keep it fresh that way
It's something you should always do,
It's still romantic, less dramatic
But it don't mean I'm not fanatic about you

So open up the door
I know that you can't wait
Till our clothes are on the floor,
On the floor, on the floor

And I will take you there
If you let me take you
To places that you've never been, never been before
And I love that dress you wear,
But it's whatever!
'Cause I think that it would look much better
On the floor, on the floor

And I will love you,
If you let me,
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
'Cause there's no other,
Place that I would,
Rather be than here with you
Darling, I know you can't wait!

And I will take you there
If you let me take you
To places that you've never been, never been before
And I love that dress you wear,
But it's whatever!
'Cause I think that it would look much better,
It would look much better!

And I will take you (and I will take you)
If you let me take you (if you let me take you)
To places that you've never been, never been before
And I love that dress you wear,
But it's whatever!
'Cause I think that it would look much better
On the floor, on the floor
It would look much better
On the floor, on the floor
