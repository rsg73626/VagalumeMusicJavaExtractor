ON YOUR MIND

Do you remember how it was?
Do you remember who I am?
Do you take the time to think of what we had?
Have you left it on a shelf?

'Cause I'll be lying if I said
It don't ever cross my mind
How we loved like no one watched us
And how we laughed until we cried

If only it was simple, baby
I would turn back time
But it's complicated
I can't make you mine
So, now he takes all your time

But does he loves you like I used to?
Does he know the things that I knew?
How you love the rain and Tennessee on ice
If I could only change the moment
Would you let me fix what's broken?
I just hope and pray I'm sometimes on your mind
So am I ever on your mind?

I've been tryna pass the time
Watch the hands up on the wall
But the pictures down the hallway
Are the anchors holding on and on, and on, and on

Maybe it's stupid
But I just can't hold my tongue
My heart's still breaking
Why you just move on?

Does he loves you like I used to?
Does he know the things that I knew?
How you love the rain and Tennessee on ice
If I could only change the moment
Would you let me fix what's broken?
I just hope and pray I'm sometimes on your mind
So am I ever on your mind?

But does he loves you like I used to?
Does he know the things that I do?
How you love the rain and Tennessee on ice
If I could only change the moment
Would you let me fix what's broken?
I just hope and pray I'm sometimes on your mind
So am I ever on your mind?
Am I ever on your mind?
Am I ever on your mind?
