MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (WITH MARTIN JENSEN)

I keep coming back to that moment
Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
'Til I can't feel my heart

And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I do all I can
To get you out of my head

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words
'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

Yeah and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
To forget you again

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words
'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words
'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
