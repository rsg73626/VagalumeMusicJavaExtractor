PAPER HEARTS

There's a lot things that I may not know 
But missing you baby 
is the only thing I know
I know
And who am I to say what 
the future holds?
But missing you baby
 is the only thing I know 
I know

If my heart was paper I 'd fold it
Trow it to the wind and just hope it
Ends up with you
I singned with love from me to you 
Tried to be cool 
But my feelings they don't allow me to 
And all that I ask 
Is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting 

Here's my paper heart
Won't you hold it, hold it 

Said you needed space 
So I gave you time
A year has gone by 
And I think you're still mine 
In my mind
And I've written you this letter
Like a hundred times 
To start a conversation 
That we should have had that night
I try 

If my heart was paper I'd fold it 
Trow it to the wind and just hope it
Ends up with you
I singned with love from me to you 
Tried to be cool 
But my feelings they don't allow me to 
And all that I ask
Is that at leat you write me back 
I'm waiting

Here's my paper heart 
Won't you hold it, hold it

Flying through fields over sand
Hoping one day it will land
And end up with you

I singned with love from me to you 
I tried to be cool 
But my feelings they don't allow mw to
And all that I ask 
Is that at least you write me back 
I'm waiting
 
Here's my paper heart 
And I just hope it 
Ends up with you
I singned with love from me to you
Trid to be cool 
But my feelings thet don't allow me to
And all that I ask
Is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting

Here's my paper heart 
Won't you hold it, hold it 

Hold it, hold it

There's a lot things that I may not know
But missing you baby 
is the only thing I know
I know
