PERSONAL (FEAT. MAGGIE LINDEMANN)

Don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)

I think it's time I let my heart out on the line
I think it's time to say
What's playing on my mind
I see you out with him and I say that I'm fine
It happens every time (every time)

I'm sick and tired of playing games
I'm sick and tired of being second place
And I know if I never try
I'll be sick and tired of being sick and tired

Don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see, girl)

You know how much I love it when you call me out
You see it in my eyes, the way they follow you around
'Cause yeah, I like the way you dance
You know I do, yeah I do
'Cause that's just you

I'm sick and tired of being friends
I'm sick and tired of being there
And I know if I never try
I'll be sick and tired of being sick and tired

Girl, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)

So, let's make it personal
Tell me what you like
Let's make it personal
'Cause I know that you want to try to get personal
Tell me what you like
Let's make it personal (personal)

So, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
Don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally
I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (you don't even see)
