SOMETIMES IT RAINS IN L.A

Every time I try to make sense of our love
It makes me cry and I see clouds up above
It ain't no lie, even my best ain't good enough
So let the feeling flow

When you're dressed up very nice
But you know there's trouble in paradise
When you think you got it right
But your G&T came without the ice

When you feel like you're the boss
But the 9 to 5's too obvious
I ain't complaining, just saying

Sometimes it rains in L. A
It can't be perfect every day
Come here with chances of hard rains
The skies were bluer yesterday

When you're screaming and you slam the door
And you tell me that you need no more
Better know it'll all be okay
Sometimes it rains in L. A

It looks like you'd arrived
And I'm soaked through to my brain
But that's alright
Won't let it drive me insane
Take my advice
Coming outside in the pouring rain
And let your feelings go

When you're dressed up very nice
But you know there's trouble in paradise
When you think you got it right
But your G&T came without the ice

When you feel like you're the boss
But the 9 to 5's too obvious
I ain't complaining, just saying

Sometimes it rains in L. A
It can't be perfect every day
Come here with chances of hard rains
The skies were bluer yesterday

When you're screaming and you slam the door
And you tell me that you need no more
Better know it'll all be okay
Sometimes it rains in L. A

I don't give a fuck so I'ma gonna strut
When the rain falls down
People gonna look, and pictures get took
But I'm alright now
I don't give a fuck, so I'ma gonna strut
When the rain falls down
People gonna look, and pictures get took
Sometimes it rains in L. A
Oh, no, no, no
We can't be perfect every day

Sometimes it rains in L. A
It can't be perfect every day
Come here with chances of hard rains
The skies were bluer yesterday

When you're screaming and you slam the door
And you tell me that you need no more
Better know it'll all be okay
Sometimes it rains in L. A

When you're screaming and you slam the door
And you tell me that you need no more
Better know it'll all be okay
Sometimes it rains in L. A

Sometimes it rains
Sometimes it rains in L. A
