SCARS

Shining so bright on the floor like a diamond
He broke it out
Now I struggle to find one, yeah
Your love is a mountain
I promise I'll climb up to the top
I wont stop

It's never been too easy
Lovin' in the dark
I know you're gonna miss dreaming
So wont you play your part
I hope you battle your demons
I get they left a mark
Though you ain't got the feeling
You're stuck with the scars

So please take your time
I've got all night babe
And moving too fast it ain't my style babe
If it takes more than a minute
and you need some rest
Bandaids for bullet holes, some hold the best
Count on me to give your heart a test
To make you hold on tighter

It's never been too easy
Lovin' in the dark
I know you're gonna miss dreaming
So wont you play your part
I hope you battle your demons
I guess they left a mark
Though you ain't got the feeling
You're stuck with the scars

Stuck with the scars
Stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars

Its never been too easy
Lovin in the dark
I know you're gonna miss dreaming
But wont you play your part
I hope you battle your demons
I get they left a mark
Though you ain't got the feeling
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars

You're stuck, you're stuck, you're stuck with the scars

You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
You're stuck with the scars
