HOPING FOR SNOW

I've made mistakes, but so have you
It's been a year of nothing new
And now I'm waiting for this to unfold

They raise their glasses, but I'm all sad
I keep the waves from the tide
Hoping to meet in the cold

And no, you're not the only reason I came home
Maybe it's the seasons, I don't know
Maybe it's because I'm on my own

Last year you took a piece of my heart
This year I guess is falling apart
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you'll come home

Last year we stole a dash in the dark
This year we're just a thought from afar
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you might make it home

I catch your breath, it fills my lungs
It takes me back to when we were young
Now it seems to be lost in the past

As I let go, I breathe you out
Before my eyes, they form a cloud
And disappear in that state in the glass

And no, you're not the only reason I came home
But maybe it's the seasons, I don't know
Maybe it's because I'm on my own

Last year you took a piece of my heart
This year I guess is falling apart
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you'll come home

Last year we stole a dash in the dark
This year we're just a thought from afar
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you might make it home

I see you out, out in the street
With nothing on your face
That shows you're missing me
And all our friends from way back when
Keep asking me just how you've been
And how I've been
And it's killing me

Last year you took a piece of my heart
This year I guess is falling apart
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you'll come home

Last year you took a piece of my heart
This year I guess is falling apart
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you'll come home

Last year we stole a dash in the dark
This year we're just a thought from afar
Everyone's hoping for snow
But I'm just hoping that you might make it home
