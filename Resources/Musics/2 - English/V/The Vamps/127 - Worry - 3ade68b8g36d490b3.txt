WORRY

I'm sorry for the way I behaved
And I'm sorry that I let you down again
I probably should've let you know
That I worry you didn't like me anymore

I worry 'bout you not getting sleep
Cause you can't if the light creeps on in
So I'd shut the curtain
Who shuts the curtain now I'm gone?
I worry 'bout your body getting cold
'Cause I can't wrap around you and keep you warm
God knows I'm hurting
But God knows you're worth it

Wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at all
So wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at, worry at all

I'm sorry that I pushed you away
And I'm sorry, I couldn't give you everything
And I need you just to try to understand
I'd let you take from me it all, it's just I feel like half a man

I worry 'bout you not getting sleep
'Cause you can't if the light creeps on in
So I'd shut the curtain
Who shuts the curtain now I'm gone?

Wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at all
So wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at, worry at all

And I tried, tried my best just to keep you around
But the weight of the world keeps on dragging me down
And now I found
That I've tried, tried my best just to keep you around
But the weight of the world keeps on dragging me down
Wake up, I've been tryna save us

Wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at all
So wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at, worry at all

And I tried, tried my best just to keep you around
But the weight of the world keeps on dragging me down
So wake up, I've been tryna save us
I'm not gonna give up, but you don't seem to worry at, worry at all
