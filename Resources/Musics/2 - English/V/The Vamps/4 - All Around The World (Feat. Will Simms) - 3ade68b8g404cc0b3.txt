ALL AROUND THE WORLD (FEAT. WILL SIMMS)

Better than magic
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
I do, I do

Something about this
This one I'm dreaming of
See everything I want
With you, with you

Blood is only water
I would walk through fire
Just for one more night with you

All around the world, around the world I go
I follow you wherever go
wherever you go
All around the world, around the world I go
I follow you wherever you go
Go wherever you go

Wherever you, wherever you
Wherever you, wherever you go
Wherever you, wherever you go

I knew when we had it
That I believe in love
Do you, do you?

Blood is only water
I would walk through fire
Just for one more night with you

All around the world, around the world I go
I follow you wherever go
wherever you go
All around the world, around the world I go
I follow you wherever you go
Go wherever you go

Wherever you, wherever you
Wherever you, wherever you go
Wherever you, wherever you go

Wherever you, wherever you
Wherever you, wherever you go
Wherever you, wherever you go

I only met her once
And straight away I knew that I loved her
I took her back to France, yeah
I had to introduce to my mother
She told me she loved me, she loved me
She told me she want me, she want me
But she's all the way
Do I come, do I stay?

So, all around the world, around the world I go
I follow you wherever go
wherever you go
All around the world, around the world I go
I follow you wherever you go
Go wherever you go

Wherever you, wherever you
Wherever you, wherever you go
Wherever you, wherever you go

Wherever you, wherever you
Wherever you, wherever you go
Wherever you, wherever you go
