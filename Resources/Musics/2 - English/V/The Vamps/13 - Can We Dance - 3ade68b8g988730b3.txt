CAN WE DANCE

I talk a lot of shit
When I'm drinkin baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends
I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you but I'd like to
Skip the small talk and romance
That's all I have to say so
Baby Can We Dance?

Here we go again
Another drink I'm caving in
Stupid words keep falling from my mouth
You know that I mean well
My hands were meant for some where else
Your eyes were doing naughty butterflies

One more drink and I should go
But maybe she might like it though
I just can't think of what to say
Should I go, should I stay

I talk a lot of shit
When I'm drinkin baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends
I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you but I'd like to
Skip the small talk and romance
That's all I have to say so
Baby Can We Dance?

I was leaning in
And you become the pushy friend
Your the bottle to my perfect ten
You know I need you though
My hearts not made for someone else
Take me in cuz I can't bear this thing

One more drink and I should go
But maybe she might like it though
I just can't think of what to say
Should I go, should I stay

I talk a lot of shit
When I'm drinkin baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends
I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you but I'd like to
Skip the small talk and romance
That's all I have to say so
Baby Can We Dance?

I've been a real bad boy
Whispering rude things in her ear
Please say she'll break
Please say she'll change
I wanna bring me back to

I talk a lot of shit
When I'm drinkin baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends
I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you but I'd like to
Skip the small talk and romance
That's all I have to say so
Baby Can We Dance?
