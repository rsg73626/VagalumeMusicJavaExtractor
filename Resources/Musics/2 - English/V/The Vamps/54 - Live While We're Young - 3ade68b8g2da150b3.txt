LIVE WHILE WE'RE YOUNG

Hey girl I'm waiting on ya
I'm waiting on ya
C'mon and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up the windows down

Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool
And we know it too

Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but just pretend it's love
And never ever ever stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young

Hey girl it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't over a thing, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah get together
Don't let the pictures leave the phone oh oh oh

Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool
And we know it too

Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never ever ever stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young

Girl
You and I
We're about to make some memories tonight
I wanna live while we're young
We wanna live while we're young

Crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never ever ever stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young
And live while we're young
And live while we're young
And live while we're young
And live while we're young
