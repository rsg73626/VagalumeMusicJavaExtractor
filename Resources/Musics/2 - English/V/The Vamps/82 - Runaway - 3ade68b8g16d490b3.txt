RUNAWAY

In the night I knew that it wasn't right
But in my mind I thought that things were fine
We told ourselves we'd never tell one soul
It was the night before we left our homes
And the whole world is onto the sun
But I don't mind, I've already said my goodbyes
I wanna do this before I die
So we can say we runaway

We're alone and broke, but that's okay
There's a fire in our hearts
Yeah we might get caught but we'll feel the same
We can say we runaway

It was cold so I gave you my coat
And the street lights flicker down this road
Your thumb in my hand darling, don't let go
If we fall off the map, they'll never know
People talk, they'll live a lie
But I see truth from the colours
That leak from your eyes

We're alone and broke, but that's okay
There's a fire in our hearts
Yeah we might get caught but we'll feel the same
We can say we runaway
We can live this life forever
We can live this life forever, baby if we runaway

Ours hands shaking as we leave this place
I swear my heart's racing, I know
That if you're not ready, then I'll forget it
Cause it's you I'm chasing I'm sure

We're alone and broke, but that's okay
There's a fire in our hearts
 they saywe might get caught but we'll feel the same
We can say we runaway
We're alone and broke, but that's okay
There's a fire in our hearts
Yeah we might get caught but we'll feel the same
We can say we runaway
We can live this life forever
We can live this life forever, baby if we runaway
