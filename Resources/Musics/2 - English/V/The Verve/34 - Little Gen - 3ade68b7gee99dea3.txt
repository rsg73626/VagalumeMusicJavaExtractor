LITTLE GEN

When it comes
I'll know, I know
Just take my clothes and leave
And I'll be gone

The straightest a crow flies
I'll leave this town behind
I'll say goodbye

So afraid that I
Told her things that I
Thought that I left behind

So see what living's done to me
My eyes are huge black balls
And I need company

I'll burn your books
That made your tags
The ones that made the pain
That I was alive
Is that a crime?

So afraid that I
I tried to tell her that I
Didn't like breathing and I
I wanted to live and if I
See the faces that I
I long to kiss and if I
Tread this path one more time..

When I go, I know, I know, I know
When I go, I know, I know, I know
When I go...you'll know
Oh no, you will know
When I go
