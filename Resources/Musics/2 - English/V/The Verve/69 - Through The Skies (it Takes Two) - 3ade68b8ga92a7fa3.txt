THROUGH THE SKIES (IT TAKES TWO)

It takes two to make my world go round
Need somebody get my feet off the ground
IÂ’m touching the bullet, thinking this is fun
In need of somebody, get me out of this hole 

Whether you do or whether you donÂ’t, 
I donÂ’t care babe
I can see the magic in your eyes
You to me ainÂ’t no passing phase, babe
Tonight wish IÂ’d walk on in the sky 

So if you hear me, 
are you tuning in
IÂ’ve got something cooking, 
can you come in?
Now I am rolling you, I wanna part
But IÂ’m too far gone to start 

Whether you do 
or whether you donÂ’t, 
I donÂ’t care babe
I could see the magic in your eyes
You to me ainÂ’t no passing phase, babe
Tonight wish IÂ’d walk on in the sky
through the sky, through the sky

Through the sky
Through the sky
Through the sky 

Tonight IÂ’ll walk on, 
on through the sky
I can see the magic in your eyes
I can see the magic in your eyes
I can see the magic in your eyes
I can see the magic in your eyes
