APPALACHIAN SPRINGS

Does anybody know where we're really gonna go? 
I was wondering if we've got that real soul 
You know the thing you cannot trade or ever own 

Does anybody know where we're really gonna go? 
I was wondering if we've got that real soul 
You know the thing we cannot trade or ever own 

Solitude, my sacred mood 
Appalachian Springs 
All my things 

Took a step to the left 
Took a step to the right 
I saw myself and it wasn’t quite right 

Does anybody know where we’re really gonna go? 
I was looking for answers in a soul 
In the feelings that a man can’t control 
I let the fire burn bright in the dead of night 
Disappointed she’d get I told a lie 
I said that I would never be on their side 

Took a step to the left 
Took a step to the right 
And I saw myself and it wasn’t quite right 
Took a step to the left 
Took a step to the right 
I keep it together, yeaaaaah… 

And I was waiting for my number come 
Like a bingo calling, singing in the sun 
You said 'our number’s 69', I said 'ok' 

Solitude, my sacred mood 
Appalachian Springs 
All my things 

Took a step to the left 
Took a step to the right 
Yeah, I keep it together 
You know I’m not lying 
Took a step to the left, yeah 
I took a step to the right 
I’m gonna keep it together 

C’mon [x 3] 

Does anybody know where we're really gonna go? 
I was wondering if we've got that real soul 
You know the thing you can’t trade or ever own 
Or ever own [x 9] 

Good luck, I’m coming home 
Feels so … (?) 
I don’t know where I’ve gone 

I took a step to the left 
I took a step to the right 
And I saw myself and it wasn’t quite right 
Yeah, a step to the dreams 
Slippin’ out, slippin’ in and out of dreams
