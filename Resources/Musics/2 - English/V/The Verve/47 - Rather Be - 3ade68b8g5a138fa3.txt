RATHER BE

There's no need for introductions
No dark corridors and fame
You`ll find your fortune
You might find some pain
I wanna lie, lie together
Feels like our last embrace
In a world full of confusion
Yeah, human race

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I've found they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

Sometimes life seems to tear us apart
Don't wanna let you go
Sometimes these feelings hidden
i start to cry
Cause I won't ever let you go

Mmmmmmmmm.... Multiplying

Always livin under some vow
Always on the eve of destruction
Make you wanna scream out loud
And as I watch the birds soar
Amount of lies of which you spun
O mmmmmmmmmm, while I'm still crying
Oh another day is coming

Cause I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here
You know these feelings I've found they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here

Sometimes life seems to tear us apart
Don't wanna let you go
Sometimes these feelings hidden
I start to cry
Cause I won`t ever let you go

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here
You know these feelings I've found they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here.

Sometimes these feelings hits me
Sometimes these feelings hits me
These feelings are oh so rare....
