GREY SKIES

In comes the rest of my life
The road was hot
We were so high we'd give NASA a fright
The road snakes around my aching shoulders, it's over
The road snakes around my shoulder one more time and it's over

Grey skies
No rain in my eyes
Cold winds
Blew her back here again

Walking back home about six past five
No one around you're the only boy alive
See through those blinds your with another guy
No one's gonna save her, I will

Grey skies
No rain in my eyes
Cold wind
Blew her back here again
Grey skies
No rain in my eyes
Cold wind
Blew her back here again

Grey skies, No rain, Goodbye, My pain (x6)

Grey skies
No rain in my eyes
Grey skies
No rain in my eyes

Cold wind
Blew her back here again
Cold wind
Blew her back here again
