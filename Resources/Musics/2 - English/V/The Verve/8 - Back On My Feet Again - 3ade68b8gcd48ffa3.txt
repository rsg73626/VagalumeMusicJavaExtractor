BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN

This is for you
My angel's life has just fallen through
Trusted in me
But what else can I offer you but love, my babe
Ain't love enough?

Three long years
Waited for you, but it crossed my dirty mind
There's baggage I know
But this plane takes off if there's no place to go
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know
I know

Lord I'm back on my feet again
Wish I were back on our feet again
I guess it's time to feel the sun on our skin
I guess it's time to feel the sun on our skin
Wishing this would never end
Wishing this would never end
Wishing my life had no end
Wish I were back on our feet again

There is no time for wasting moments
That we have longed to share
There was a day
When I almost prayed
That I could see you there by my side

By my side
Ain't love enough?

Lord, we're back on our feet again
Lord, I'm back on my feet again

Guess it's time to feel the sun on our skin (shine on)
Guess it's time to feel the sun on our skin (shine on)

Saying things like "It never ends" (shine on)

Yeah, I believe that this will never end (shine on)
Yeah, I believe that this will never end (move it on)
Yeah, I believe that our love never ends (be strong)
Yes, I believe that our love never ends (move it on)
Yes, I believe that our love never ends (move it on)
Yes, I believe our love will never end (it's going on)

It shall shine on, let's get it on (shine on, shine on)
It will shine on, it will shine on, 
it will shine on, it will shine on, it will shine
Cause love's enough, cause love's enough
Cause love's enough, cause love's enough
Cause love's enough
