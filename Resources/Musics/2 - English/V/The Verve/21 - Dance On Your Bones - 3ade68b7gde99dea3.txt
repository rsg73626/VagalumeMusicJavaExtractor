DANCE ON YOUR BONES

Devil comes out at night
Looking for some young bones
to do his work
Maybe you could steal and try
Sticking needles in your arm in the park

Hey kids where's the gun?
Where's the old fun?
Hey kids where's your gun?
Who's going to have this fun?

Devil blows his wind down my road
Looking for some fragile minds
Maybe I could still get loose
Maybe we could dance to get loose

Hey kids where's your guns?
Don't you have no fun?
He said, "Hey kid, pick up the gun
Don't you like this one?"
He said, "Hey kid, pick up the gun
Don't you want a little fun?"

Devil blows cold down my road
Looking for some young bones for his work

You don't work, you can't eat
Devil's gonna dance on your bones, on your bones...

Hey kids, where's your guns?
Don't you like this one?
Devil blows cold down my road
You don't work, you can't eat
Hey kids buy some more
Hey kids buy some guns

...The Devil blows...
...The Devil blows...
