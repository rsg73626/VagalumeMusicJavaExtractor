THIS COULD BE MY MOMENT

I'm the only man who ever really thought that i had
qualified 
From the corners of your mind you would care for
another guy, 

Now i'm lookin at you straight in the eye, 
i know it feels good and i know you should try me 

But every chance you get you just hesitate, 
Is there something in my love that you really hate, 

Open me up i feel real glad, 
You can take all i have, 
Maybe maybe dont you think its time yeah tonight?

This Could be my moment, somethin more than weather 
Don't you wanna try it (Maybe, Maybe) 
This could be my moment, somethin more than weather 
Don't you wanna try it 

I'll open up my mind i swear i'd let you in 
There's nothin that you couldent beg steal or have 

I'm lookin at you straight in the eye 
I know it feels good and i know ya'll high 
Maybe, Maybe dont you think its time yeah tonight? 

This could be my moment, somethin more than weather 
Don't you wanna try it (Maybe, Maybe) 
This could be my moment somethin more than weather 
Don't you wanna try it 

There's only one 
There's only one 
There's one life one chance, come on lets hit the
floor 

This could be my moment (come on now!), somethin more
than weather 
Don't you wanna try it 
Somethin more than everyday, a chance to walk and
break away 
Don't you wanna try it 

Come on and wipe those tears away from your eyes 
This could be my last chance 
There'll be no better night (gotta go sacrafice) 
This could be my my last chance 
This could be my my last chance 
There'll be no better time, Yeah! 
There'll be no better day, Yeah!
