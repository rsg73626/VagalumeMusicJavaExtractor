THE HIGHER I GO

When you come 
I feel that I 
I've never been 
Here before 
I don't even 
Know the score
And you 
Tell me the truth 
I called once 
From everywhere 
And faces 
That will 
Have me there
The higher I go 
The more 
I seem to grow
The further I see 
The more 
You write to me

When you go 
I feel that I 
I've never been 
Here before 
I don't even 
Know the score
And you tell me 
The truth 
I called once 
From everywhere 
And faces 
That will 
Have me there
The higher I go 
The more 
I seem to grow
The further I see
The more 
You write to me
