SO IT GOES

Life - roll my die, change this life
You said this movie was mine
But now you go and change your mind
This is my life

So it goes... you come in on your own in this life
You know you leave on your own

'Cause I don't need no calls
When my feelings fall
You showed me things I didn't want to see
I don't believe that love is free
Sure fine way to treat a man

So it goes... you come in on your own in this life
And you know you leave on your own

I'm just a boy, and a wifeless fella
Another drink and I won't miss her
