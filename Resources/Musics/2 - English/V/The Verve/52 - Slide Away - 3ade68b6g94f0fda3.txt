SLIDE AWAY

So take your time
I wonder if you're here just to use my mind
Don't take it slow
You know I've got a place to go
You always do that something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away

I was thinking maybe we could go outside
Let the night sky cool you foolish pride
Don't you feel alive? 
These are your times and our highs

So take your time
I wonder which cup you drink from
I hope it's mine
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away

Cause I read you mind
I read it because it takes me where I can't find
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and burn away

I was thinking maybe we could go outside
Let the night sky cool you foolish pride
Don't you feel alive?
These are our times and your highs

Slide away, burn away
Slide away, burn away
I read you mind, read your mind
Because it takes me where I can find
I read your mind, read your mind, ohh

I was thinking maybe we could go outside
Let the night sky cool you foolish pride
Don't you feel alive?
These are our times and our highs

Baby maybe we could go outside
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Open up, you'll feel alive
These are your times and my highs
