ON YOUR OWN

Tell me what you see
Was it a dream? Was I in it?
Life seemed so obscene until it's over
Who knows?

All I want is someone who can fill the hole
In the life I know
In between life and death when there's nothing left
Do you wanna know?

You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've know
And your friends on your own

Tell me if it's true
That I need you, you are changing
I've seen this road before down on the floor
It is hurting me

All I want is someone who can fill the hole in the life I know
In between life and death when there's nothing left
Do you want to know?

You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've know
And your friends on your own

Lies I've got to get rid of this whole inside
