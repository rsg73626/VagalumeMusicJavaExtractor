STARING STRANGER

Yes 
I was thinking ?bout 
the time when I was dead
I was passive, bored,
you know 
I lived my life 
in a shell
Now 
I?m shooting off again, 
and it feels good
Just thinking about 
the good times
Cause my love, 
I know you?re just 
a staring stranger
You fill up my holes
You make me feel safe
I know you?re just 
a staring stranger
You fill up my holes
You make me feel 

I know time 
was getting late,
 but not in my mind
Never asked you, 
just jump up
And let my life die, 
when I was thinking 
about the love
That I have made, 
the love 
that I have lost
Many days 
and days and days
Oh well 
I know you?re just 
a staring stranger
You fill up my holes
You make me feel safe
I know you?re just 
a staring stranger
You fill up my holes
You make me feel 

Cause my love, 
I know you?re just 
a staring stranger
You fill up my holes
You make me feel safe
I know you?re just 
a staring stranger
You fill up my holes
You make me feel safe
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
