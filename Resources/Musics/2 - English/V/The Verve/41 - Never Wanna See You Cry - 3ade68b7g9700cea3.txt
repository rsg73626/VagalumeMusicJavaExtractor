NEVER WANNA SEE YOU CRY

I don't like the way that you say you feel fine
when you look so down
And I don't like the way that the pills you take
they just keep you down

Shiney little minds
Trying to find my way in life
String of broken hearts
Well they still made it
You ready to start?

Never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna hold you with tears in your eyes
Never wanna see you burn
There's so much I gotta tell you
So much that you'll learn

I'm dying, dying, baby, dying
To get close to you
But sometimes, sometimes the wall you built
You know, I can't get through

Shiney little minds
Trying to find my way in life
String of broken hearts
Well they still made it
You ready to start?

I never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna hold you with tears in my eyes
Never wanna see you die
There's so much I gotta tell you
So much that you'll learn

Cause I never wanna see you cry'
No I never wanna see you die
No I never wanna see you cry
No I never wanna see you cry
Cause I never wanna see you cry
No I never wanna se you cry
No I never wanna see you die
Oh I never wanna see you die...
