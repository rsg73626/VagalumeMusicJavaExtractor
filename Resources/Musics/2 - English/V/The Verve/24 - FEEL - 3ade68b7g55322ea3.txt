FEEL

This darkness cooled my light
We move to different sides
I poured the guilt right over my eyes
As I rose to greet the sky


I've never felt this before
See you dead on the floor
I can't recall a single day 
That's gonna make this pain slip away


My senses have been so cold
Didn't know how to feel or hold
For a second I felt something in you 
For a second I believed in you


And I wanna know
And I wanna be
And I wanna feel


And I wanna know
And I wanna be
And I wanna feel


And I wanna know
And I wanna be
And I wanna feel


And I wanna know
And I wanna be
And I wanna feel


We could, my friend 
We can
We could, my friend
We can
We should not end
I wanna be part of...


And I wanna know
And I wanna be
And I wanna feel
