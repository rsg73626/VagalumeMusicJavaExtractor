BUTTERFLY (ACOUSTIC)

You could flap your wings a thousand miles away
Butterfly
A laughing salesman sings
His world so far away
Butterfly

Butterfly
Butterfly

You could take the storm away forever every day
Cause you're mine
And I don't know what to say
You could let my smile disappear for a year
Cause you're mine
That's the only way I like it to be

Butterfly
Butterfly
Butterfly
Butterfly

You could flap your wings a thousand miles away
I'd still feel the pain
I'd still feel the pain
You could flap those eyes a thousand miles away
I'd still feel the way
I'd still feel the way

Butterfly

Here she comes now
Here she comes now
Here it comes now
Here she comes now
Here it comes now...
When we get to the best part
It happens all the time
You tell me all your lies
You tell me all your lies
You get your kicks from seeing me on the floor
Tied to your bed
Tied to the things you said
Butterfly is coming back
Butterfly is coming back
Butterfly is coming back
Butterfly is coming back
