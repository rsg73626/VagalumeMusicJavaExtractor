TWILIGHT

What I said
Couldn't be that good
Because you left
You left


????
What I did
Seems so strange now
When I touch you
And you taught me
And what we did
was something good
What we did.......???????
You changed me
I couldn't change
I couldn't change
Anybody know exactly what Richard is singing here?
e-mail me please
