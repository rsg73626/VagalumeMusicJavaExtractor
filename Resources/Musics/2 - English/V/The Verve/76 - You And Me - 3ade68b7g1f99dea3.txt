YOU AND ME

Someday I'll die for you
Baby I'd die for you

I know I seem discovered
But I'm buried deep inside
There's a hole so wide
You can see through it day or night
Come on and let me try

It's you and me against the world
But the world is learning
So knock on my door
And let my world start turning

And I was feeling low
You show me where this boy should go
Meet me at the end of the road
I need someone to hold
Yeah I need someone to hold

It's you and me against the world
But the world is learning
So knock on my door
And let my world start turning

I see it's up to me
And now we'll watch me suffer
Oh I see it's up to me
And now we'll watch me suffer
And no wonder

It's you and me against the world
But the world is learning
Don't you knock on my door
And let this world start turning
Start turning
Turning
I hope you are learning
I hope you are learning
Babe, I hope you are learning yeah
