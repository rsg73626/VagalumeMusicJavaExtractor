NO KNOCK ON MY DOOR

She knew my feelings were tangled and frayed,
She took me into a windblown alleyway,
She showed me what a boy should see,
I'll thank her till the day that I die.

So..here we go...
No knock on my door.
Baby, Till you see what living has done to me.
And I'm sure that life means more than this.

I took her to a room and I showed her myself,
She made feel proud and respectful,
There's nothing that this girl won't do for me,
For that I've gotta thank her, I mean it.

So..here we go...
A face in the crowd,
Jump up then jump down,
Baby.
Can you see through me?

Sure,I've been here before,
No knock on my door,
No love, in the car.
Baby...
Please be my style.
Sure,I've seen it before,
No knock on my door,
Love in the car can be painful I know.
Cry, I've cried every night.
I need to hold you Child,
Oh, But can you see me?
Knocking down your door.
Sure, There's times I have crawled,
And there is times I have dreamed,
Oh, but it seems that, must you need my love?
And I never seem to put it out, my love.
And I'm shaking,
I'm shaking,
and I'm shaking
