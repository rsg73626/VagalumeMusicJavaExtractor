HOOK ME UP

I'm tired of my life
I feel so in between
I'm sick of all my friends
Girls can be so mean

I feel like jumping out
Everything's my way
Starting over new
Cause I'm not even there

Sometimes
I wanna get away some place
But I don't wanna stay too long
Sometimes
I wanna brand new day
Try to fit in where I don't belong

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up, Hook Me Up

I'd like the lights turned out
The sound of closing doors
I'm not like other girls
Who always feel so sure

With everything made up
Of what they're gonna be
Sometimes I'm just a girl
Who's not so tired of me

Sometimes
I wanna disappear some place
But I don't wanna stay to long
Sometimes
I'm feeling so alone
Tryna' fit in where I don't belong

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up, Hook Me Up
Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up

I'm gonna crash and burn
I'm gonna find a way
There's nothing left to say

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook (Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hook)
Me Up
Where should we go, I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough, 
Hook Me Up, Hook Me Up,
Hook Me Up
