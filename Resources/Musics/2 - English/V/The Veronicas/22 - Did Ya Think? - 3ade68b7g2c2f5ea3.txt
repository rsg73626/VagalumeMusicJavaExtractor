DID YA THINK?

She asked if you could stay
did ya think about me when
you almost turned away
did you think about me when
you picked up the phone
should have let it just ringing
And made it seem like everything
was the same as it had always been

Chorus:
Did ya think about me being half awake and crying,
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day
Didn't think about tearing me apart,
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right.
why, why, why?

Now in an after thought
were you thinking about me
Dont know what u did it for
Cuz u were thinking about you, so
you want me to believe
you were thinking about me
Isn't hard for me to see u didnt stop for anything

Repeat Chorus

Give me one good reason why in time i should believe in you
you had me, you had it, everything
So close your eyes and remember all the lies
that you never say when you pretend that you
will be with me again

Repeat Chorus(3x)
