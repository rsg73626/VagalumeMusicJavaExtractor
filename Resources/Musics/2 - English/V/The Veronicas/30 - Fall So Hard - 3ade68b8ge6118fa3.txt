FALL SO HARD

Walk into the room
I look an' I assume
That your just like all the other guys
I look into your eyes
You got me mesmerised
Your pulling me into your dreams
Eyes are so intense
From the lost suspense as
If I haven't seen your face before
Don't know why I feel
You just seem so surreal
I can't get you outta my mind

Wooh
Wooh
I don't even know your name
Wooh
Wooh
But I still feel the same

How can I fall so hard for someone
Who only has a face no name
I've never felt this way by anyone


Wooh
Wooh
I just wanna know his name
Wooh
Wooh
(I should wait more?)
'Cause I still feel the same

How can I fall so hard for someone
Who only has a face no name
I've never felt this way by anyone
I thought you guys were all the same
How, how can I fall so hard for someone
How was I supposed to know
Got his name I think about the wonder
Save my broken heart and soul

Wooh
Wooh
I don't even know your name
Wooh
Wooh
'Cause I still feel the same

How can I fall so hard for someone
Who only has a face no name
I've never felt this way by anyone
I thought you guys were all the same
How can I fall so hard for someone
How was I supposed to know
Got his name I think about the wonder
Save my broken heart and soul

How, how can I fall so hard for someone
Who only has a face no name
Never felt this way by anyone
I thought you guys were all the same
How can I fall so hard for someone
How was I supposed to know
Got his name I think about the wonder
Save my broken heart and soul
