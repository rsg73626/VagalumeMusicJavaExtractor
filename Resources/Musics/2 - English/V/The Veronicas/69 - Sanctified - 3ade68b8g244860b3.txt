SANCTIFIED

Follow me to the river
In over your head this time
I'll take you down to the river
Baby, just you and I (baby, just you and I)
I push you down a little deeper
Under the full moon sky
I'll get you a little closer
Just one breath from the other side
(One breath from the other side)

Take me down to the river (I'll take you down to the river)
In over my head this time
Take me down to the river (I'll take you down to the river)
You're making me lose my mind
Take me down to the river (take me down to the river)
Where the dirty gets sanctified

Sanctified
I'll watch you sinking in
There's nobody else
Sanctified
I'll watch you sink in
There's nobody else
Sanctified
Energy confront
Sanctified
