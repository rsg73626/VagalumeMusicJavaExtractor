HOLLYWOOD

Things are so different here
all truths seem to dissapear
and who you were doesn't matter
my point is a better view
make me look beatiful
and every face same old story


CHORUS

In hollywood, hollywood
every sunrise you get so close
every sunset an overdose
no one cares but everybody knows

vask [ or bask ] in someone elses fame
live off of the family name
and who you are is all that matter
its so hard being young today
dior adds and pink cocaine
you'll go far for doing nothing

[ chorus ]

everybody wants to be someone
everybody wants to be someone else
and when your down they'll hand you a shot gun
just get me out, get me out
of hollywood

[ chorus ]

get me out 6x
