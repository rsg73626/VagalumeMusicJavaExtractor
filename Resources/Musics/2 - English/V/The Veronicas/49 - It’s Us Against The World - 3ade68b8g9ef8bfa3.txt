ITâ€™S US AGAINST THE WORLD

Sometimes you feel like you just wanna die inside
Their kickin? dirt in your face makin? you wanna cry
Shake it off, shake it off, get yourself out off bed
When you feel like its all comin? crashin? down
Here comes the rain and you think that you?re startin?
to drown
Play it off, play it off, get it out of your head

Cause it won?t really matter
The bads just gonna get better
And I won?t let it bring you down
Its us against the world
Nothin?s gunna stop us
We?ll always have each other

You?ll never be alone
Its us against the world
Nothin?s gunna break us
No we won?t let it shake us
I want you to know
Its us against the world
When you feel like its all comin? crashin? down
Here comes the rain and you think that you?re startin? to drown

Let it go, let it go, it?ll be alright
Cause it won?t really matter
The bads just gonna get better
And I won?t let it bring you down
Its us against the world
Nothin?s gunna stop us

We?ll always have each other
You?ll never be alone
Its us against the world
Nothin?s gunna break us
No we won?t let it shake us
I want you to know
Its us against the world
Its us against the world
Cause it don?t really matter
The bads just gunna get better

And I won?t let it bring you down
Its us against the world
Nothin?s gunna stop us
We?ll always have each other
You?ll never be alone
Its us against the world
Nothin?s gunna break us
No we won?t let it shake us
I want you to know
Its us against the world
