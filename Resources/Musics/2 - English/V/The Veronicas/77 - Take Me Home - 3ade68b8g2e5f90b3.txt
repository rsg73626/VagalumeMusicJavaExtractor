TAKE ME HOME

Cuz I won't keep me home at night

So just take take take it all
I got half a mile to just walk away
I can't wait wait take me now I can show you how
But you never stay I say say surrender me
If your not gonna give give into me
Cuz I'm not going suffer if you don't want my love

I don't wanna always take it slow
I just want someone to take me home
You say that you love me
Well don't let me down
I don't wanna hear you say goodbye
I just wanna hear you'll stay the night
You say that you love me
Well show me right now

I don't wanna hear you say goodbye
I just wanna hear you'll stay the night
You say that you love me
Well show me right now

I don't wanna always take it slow
I just want someone to take me home
You say that you love me
Well don't let me down
I don't wanna hear you say goodbye
I just wanna hear you'll stay the night
You say that you love me
Well show me right now

Don't wanna let this go
(You know I will never come back)
Don't wanna take it slow
(You know I will never come back now)
You say that you love me
Well don't let me down

Don't wanna let this go
(You know I will never come back)
Don't wanna take it slow
(You know I will never come back now)
You say that you love me
Well show me right now

Don't wanna let this go
Don't wanna take it slow
