MOUTH SHUT

I kept my mouth shut from the start 
I guess I left you in the dark 
You thought you knew me but you don't 
You say you love me but you won't 
When you find out who I am 

I kept my mouth shut for too long 
All this time you got me wrong 
And now I'm in this way too far 
I'm about to break your heart 
Tear everything we had apart 

[Chorus] 
Coz I'm feeling lost 
When I'm in your arms 
The reasons are gone 
For why I was holding onto you 
I tried so hard 
To be the one (be the one) 
I don't like who I've become 

Won't keep my mouth shut anymore 
I've had my share of closing doors 
And now I know I'm not afraid 
I know exactly what you'll say 
But I'm sorry it's too late 

[Chorus] 
Coz I'm feeling lost 
When I'm in your arms 
The reasons are gone 
For why I was holding onto you 
I tried so hard 
To be the one (be the one) 
I don't like who I've become 

Yeah Yeah yeah yeah 
I kept it inside of me for all this time 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Thought that I could make it work if I just tried 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
But I'm sorry to admit that I have lived a lie 

Yeeeaaah 

[Chorus] 
Coz I'm feeling lost 
When I'm in your arms 
The reasons are gone 
For why I was holding onto you 
I tried so hard 
To be the one (be the one) 
I don't like who I've become 

I've kept my mouth shut for too long 
And now I know that it was wrong 
I should've told you from the start 
That this was never meant to last 
We should've never gone this far 

Won't keep my mouth shut any more (wont keep my mouth shut any more) 
Won't keep my mouth shut any more (wont keep my mouth shut any more
