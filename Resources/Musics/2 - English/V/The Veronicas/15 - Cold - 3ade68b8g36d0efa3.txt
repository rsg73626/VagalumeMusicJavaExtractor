COLD

'cause I'm dying here 
you were lying here
it was you and I forever
but now you make me shiver in the light
and I'm dying here
and I'm crying for the you that I remember
but now you make me shiver you're so...

am I meant to sit here and just take this
when you promise me 
I would be the one that you'd never leave
can't believe I fell for what you said
does it make you feel good
to make me feel less than I am?
to make you feel strong?
like you're a bigger man?
what did I do to deserve you to shut me out?
did I love to much? is that what this is about?
I used to thank god every morning 
for having you in my life
now I'm praying just to forget you 
and you know why ...

'cause I'm dying here
you were lying here
it was you and I forever
but now you make me shiver in the light
and I'm dying here
and I'm crying for the you that I remember
but now you make me shiver you're so...
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old

and if you were gonna lie
at least be a man and lie to my face
so you can watch my tears turn to blood
as I tear myself apart
wondering why, why I ever fell for you
I put myself though hell for you
fuck you, I hate you!
I love you, I need you
wanna run
wanna run
I wanna run but I don't wanna run 
if you're not gonna find me
so we should just pretend to be friends, right?
and fake our way to the bitter end

'cause I'm dying here 
you were lying here
it was you and I forever
but now you make me shiver in the light
and I'm dying here
and I'm crying for the you that I remember
but now you make me shiver you're so....
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old

and I'm dying here
and I'm crying for the you that I remember
but now you make me shiver you're so....
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old

now you make me shiver in the light
and I'm dying here
and I'm crying for the you that I remember
but now you make me shiver you're so....
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
co-o-o-o-o-o-o-old
