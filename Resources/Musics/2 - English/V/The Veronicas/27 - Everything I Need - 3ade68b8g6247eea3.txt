EVERYTHING I NEED

Life has been easy
It's been hander down
The world is a place you
Don't know that well
It's always surrounded
But what's Going on?
Everything you live for
Is now going wrong
No oh

Chorus:
You have
Everything I'd ever need
But you can't offer me anything
I'm happy here living my dreams
'Cause I am who I wanna be

Looking for something
But you don't know what
'Cause all you've ever known is
All that you've got
Everything is changing
What's going on?
The life that you knew
Now is suddenly gone
No oh

Repeat Chorus

All your life you wondered
Where you belong
It's always surrounded
All you live for is going wrong

Life has been easy
You've had it all
Slowly surrounded
What's going on?
Everything is changing
It's all going wrong
The life that you knew
Now is suddenly gone
Gone

Repeat Chorus
