LINE OF FIRE

I love the way you say my name
I'm in a love sick daze
so won't you stay?

don't you try to deny, fight or hide
cause eyes don't lie
I see the signs

standing in your line of fire (fire, fire)
sorry, I'm real bad liar (liar, liar)
you just blow me away (you just blow me away)
you just blow me away (you just blow me away)
you just blow me away

going for the kill
you know you make me feel like a hunter
going for the kill
you know you make me feel like a hunter

it's insane, lame, a shame
I can't steal you away, hey hey
what do you say? Let's escape

standing in your line of fire (fire, fire)
sorry I'm real bad liar (liar, liar)
you just blow me away (you just blow me away)
you just blow me away (you just blow me away)
you just blow me away

going for the kill
you know you make me feel like a hunter
going for the kill
you know you make me feel like a hunter

standing in your line of fire (fire, fire)
sorry I'm real bad liar (liar, liar)
you just blow me away (you just blow me away)
you just blow me away (you just blow me away)
you just blow me away

you just blow me away
