LUV LUV LUV

Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love you say
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love you say
and what i say you need money too

Why don't you hold the door for me?
Why don't you wake me when you leave?
What do you have to offer me,
When all you do is take for me?
My love don't come for free

It's not enough to make it up
But say you not your sorry

Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love,you say
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love you say
and what i say you need money too

Why don't you in a fight for me?
Why don't you write a song for me?
Everything you promised me
All your empty words of misery
Your words don't mean a thing

It's not enough to make it up
But say you not your sorry

Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love,you say
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love you say
and what i say you need money too

Luv Luv Luv....

Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love,you say
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love
Luv Luv Luv
all you need is love you say
and what i say, you need money too

Luv Luv Luv
(Ohh, you even make it up to me)
Luv Luv Luv
(Ohhh, you even make it up)
Luv Luv Luv

And what i say, you need money too

Ohh, give all your money
You were between the sky i ever know
Can You wait, can you wait for me?
