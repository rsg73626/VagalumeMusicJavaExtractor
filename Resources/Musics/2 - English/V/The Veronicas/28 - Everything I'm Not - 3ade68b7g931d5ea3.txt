EVERYTHING I'M NOT

O no don't go changing, that's what you told me from the start, 
Thought you were something different, that's when it all just fell apart, 
Like you're so perfect, and I can't measure up, 
Well I'm not perfect, just all messed up 

I was losing myself to somebody else, but now I see 
I don't wanna pretend so this is the end of you and me 
Cause the girl that you want, 
She was tearing us apart, 
Cause she's everything, everything im not 

It's not like I need somebody, telling me where I should go at night 
Don't worry you'll find somebody, someone to tell how to live their life, 
Cause your so perfect and no one measures up, yeah all by yourself your all messed up 

I was losing myself to somebody else, but now I see 
I don't wanna pretend so this is the end of you and me 
Cause the girl that you want, 
She was tearing us apart, 
Cause she's everything, everything im not 

Now wait a minute, because of you I never knew all the things I had 
Hey don't u get it, im not going anywhere with u tonight cause this is my life 

I was losing myself to somebody else, but now I see 
I don't wanna pretend so this is the end of you 'n me 
Cause the girl that you want, 
She was tearing us apart, 
Cause she's everything, everything im not 

But now I see 
I don't wanna pretend so this is the end of you and me 
Cause the girl that you want she was tearing us apart, cause she's everything, everything im not
