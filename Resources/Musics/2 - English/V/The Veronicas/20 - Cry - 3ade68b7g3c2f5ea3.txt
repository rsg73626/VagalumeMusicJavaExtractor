CRY

All my life you've had an opinion
Doing things for the wrong reasons
Well, not today
Don't you know I think for myself
I get on fall without anybody's help
Don't care what you say
I'm breaking your heart
But I'm breaking apart
All you do is hold me, hold me down
Try to make me someone I don't know
Another girl you thought you found

Chorus:
What would you do
If I told you
You can't control my life?
What would you say
If I left today
With no regrets and no goodbye
What would you do
If I told you
There is no more you and I?
What would you say
If I walked away
And left you there to cry

I don't know what's coming over you
Or how we fell apart
I try so hard but I don't believe you
You're not the guy I thought I knew

Repeat Chorus

What would you say
If I said to you
Just go ahead and cry
