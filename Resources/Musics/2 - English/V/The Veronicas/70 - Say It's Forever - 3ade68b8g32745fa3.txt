SAY IT'S FOREVER

Standing under a velvet sky
The stars are shinin' in your eyes and
Nothing else ever felt so right
So why don't we just steal the night and

Find a place where we can see
The fire of love burn endlessly
We'll fly away inside a dream
And solve the mystery

Say it's forever, you in my life
Let's stay together, say it's tonight
Say it's forever, just you and me
And let me love you

Say it's forever, no more goodbyes
Let's stay together, say you'll be mine
Say it's forever, just let it be
And let me love you

Music plays on the radio
We're dancing softly, dancing slow when
Moonlight falls in the afterglow
It leads us down the stardust road

We'll find a place where we can see
The fire of love burn endlessly
We'll fly away inside a dream
And solve the mystery

Say it's forever, you in my life
Let's stay together, say it's tonight
Say it's forever, just you and me
And let me love you

Say it's forever, no more goodbyes
Let's stay together, say you'll be mine
Say it's forever, just let it be
And let me love you

We'll light the midnight sky
We'll color the stars with all our love
We'll see a new sun rising here just for us

Say it's forever, you in my life
Let's stay together, say it's tonight
Say it's forever, just you and me
And let me love you

Say it's forever, no more goodbyes
Let's stay together, say you'll be mine
Say it's forever, just let it be
And let me love you

Say it's forever, you in my life
Let's stay together, say it's tonight
Say it's forever, just you and me
And let me love you
