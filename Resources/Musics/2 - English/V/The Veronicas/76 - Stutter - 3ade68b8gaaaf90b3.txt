STUTTER

Your eyes are dangerous
They're begging me to say hello
You don't know my name
But I'm that girl that just won't let you go

Someone call emergency, a 911
Cuz baby, I am reckless like a loaded gun
Livin' for the night, we rocket to the sun
I just can't believe, can't believe what you do to me

You make me nervous, make me sweat
Make me st-st-st-stutter
You're like a drug, you're like sex
You're like n-n-no other
So come with me, my fantasy
This is my song and I, and I
Don't want to dance alone

Don't make me dance this all alone
And I don't want to dance alone
Don't make me dance this song alone

The ground is shaking and the bass
It makes me go oh oh
People all around me, but tell me
Do you want a show, what I don't know

Someone call emergency, a 911
Baby let's get reckless like a loaded gun
Livin' for the night, we rocket to the sun
I still can't believe, can't believe what you do to me

You make me nervous, make me sweat
Make me st-st-st-stutter
You're like a drug, you're like sex
You're like n-n-no other
So come with me, my fantasy
This is my song and I
And I don't want to dance alone

Don't make me dance this all alone
And I don't want to dance alone
Don't make me dance this song alone

Beneath the moonlight sky
Kiss me through the night
Never say goodbye

Beneath the moonlight sky
Kiss me through the night
Never say goodbye

You make me nervous, make me sweat
Make me st-st-st-stutter
You're like a drug, you're like sex
You're like n-n-no other
So come with me, my fantasy
This is my song and I, and I
Don't want to dance alone

Don't make me dance this song alone
And I don't want to dance alone
Don't make me dance this song alone

And I don't want to dance alone
Don't make dance this song alone
And I don't want to dance alone
Don't make me dance this song alone
