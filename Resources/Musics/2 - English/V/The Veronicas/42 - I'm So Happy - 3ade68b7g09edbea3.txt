I'M SO HAPPY

First Verse:

[...]
Tequila and the Salt Shaker lies on the blanket where you sleep . . . 
I could never escape that scene [...]

Chorus:

I'm so happy
Happy here with you
Are you happy
Say your happy too
All I need I found in you
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
here with you

Second Verse:

That smile on your face
the thought that can't erase
from my mind
In this lonely complicated world
You'll never know what you'll find
I don't want to leave when I'm in your arms

Chorus:

I'm so happy
Happy here with you
Are you happy
Say your happy too
All I need I found in you
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
here with you



Here with you
I'm with you
Oooh

Chorus:

I'm so happy
Happy here with you
Are you happy
Say your happy too
All I need I found in you
I'm so happy here with you

Are you happy?
So happy
Are you happy?
So Happy

All I need I found in you
I'm so happy 
I'm so happy
here with you
