I COULD GET USED TO THIS

You make me breakfast in bed
When I'm mixed up in my head
You wake me with a kiss
I could get used to this

You think I look the best
When my hair is a mess
I can't believe you exist
I could get used to this

Because I know you're too good to be true
I must have done something good to meet you

Chorus
â€˜Cause you wrote my name across your hand
When I freak you understand
There is not a thing you miss
And I could get used to this

I'm feeling it comin' over me
With you it all comes naturally
Lost the reflex to resist
And I could get used to this

You love the songs I write
You like the movies I like
There must be some kind of twist
But I could get used to this

you listen to me when I'm depressed
It doesn't seem to make you like me less

Repeat Chorus

If there's a dark side to you I haven't seen it
Every good thing you do feels like you mean it

Repeat Chorus

You make me breakfast in bed
When I'm mixed up in my head
You wake me with a kiss
And I could get used to this
