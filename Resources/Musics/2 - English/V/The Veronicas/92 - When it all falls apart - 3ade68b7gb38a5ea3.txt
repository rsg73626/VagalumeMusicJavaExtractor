WHEN IT ALL FALLS APART

I'm having the day from hell
It was all going so well before you came
And told me you needed space
With a kiss on the side of my face... not again

And not to mention the tears I shed
When I should have kicked your ass instead
I need intervention
Attention to stop temptation to scream... baby

Chorus:
Everything is f'ed up
Straight from the heart
Tell me what do you do
When it all falls apart
Gotta pick myself up
Where do I start
‘Cause I can't turn to you
When it all falls apart

Don't know where I parked my car
Don't know who my real friends are anymore
I put my faith in you
What a stupid thing to do... when it pours

And not to mention I drank to much
I'm feelin' hungover and out of touch
I need intervention
Attention to stop temptation to scream... baby

Repeat Chorus

Can't it be easier? Can't I just change my life?
‘Cause it just seems to go bad everytime
Will I be mending?
Another one ending once again

Repeat Chorus
