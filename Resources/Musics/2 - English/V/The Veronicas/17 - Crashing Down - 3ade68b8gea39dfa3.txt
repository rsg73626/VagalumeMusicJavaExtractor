CRASHING DOWN

I’m getting tired of the way that you speak to me
I’m feeling lost in what you want me to be
Cause I know you don’t care about what I think
I don’t get why you always gotta be so bad
You’re on a power trip the way you put me down
You think the world was made to follow you around
But one day you will find
That you can’t keep on stepping on everyone in your life
And you crossed the line cause…

You are coming crashing down so fast
Did you ever get that feeling
That a little was a long way
You are coming crashing down at last
Now you get what you were given
That a little was a long way

It’s like you never heard the word compromise
You try to make excuses but I know the lies
You can’t hide the truth when it’s in your eyes
You tried to prove me wrong so you can start a fight
It’s so predictable the way you think you are right
Then you lose control with no reason why

But one day you will find
That you can’t keep on running
When it gets too hard to try
Cause you crossed the line

You are coming crashing down so fast
Did you ever get that feeling
That a little was a long way
You are coming crashing down at last
Now you get what you were given
That a little was a long way

You are not gonna win
The time is coming near
And you will be left behind
And now I’m not gonna wait
You are sorry, too late
I’ve made up my mind
I’ve made up my mind

You are coming crashing down so fast
You are coming crashing down so fast
Did you ever get that feeling
That a little was a long way
You are coming crashing down at last
Now you get what you were given
That a little was a long way

You are coming crashing down so fast
Did you ever get that feeling
That a little was a long way
