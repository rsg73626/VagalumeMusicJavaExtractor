HEART LIKE A BOAT

If I could cut little stars out of the paper sky
I'd put them in a box and make wishes at night
It would be you and I
Inside a secret, we would find
at the bottom of a garden,
in the house that we would buy

Your eyes, they never tell a lie
and your smile, it gets me every time
Please don't wish me away

My heart is in my throat singing out for you
ahhohohoh
My heart is like a boat sailing after you
ahahohohoh

You think its cool when I cry
'Cause I never show and tell
When you kiss me, I die
oh, you know me so well
If I could bottle your tears
I would throw them from the clouds
In our world, id be dancing
And the rain would fall down

Your name, my favorite word to say
And I dream you in my everyday
Please don't wish me away

My heart is in my throat singing out for you
ahhohohohhh
My heart is like a boat sailing after you
ahahohohohhh

ahhohohhh

And your eyes, they never tell a lie
And your smile, it gets me every time
Please don't wish me away
'Cause

My heart is in my throat singing out for you
ahhohohohhh
My heart is like a boat sailing after you
ahahohohohhh

My breath is like the wind whispering 'I love you'
ahahohohohhh
My heart is like a boat sailing after you.
ahahohohohhh
