REVENGE IS SWEETER (THAN YOU EVER WERE)

I saw it in the news
You told me they were wrong
And I stood up for you
'Cause I believed you were the one
You had all the chances in the world
To let me know the truth
What the hell is wrong with you

Chorus: Are you even listening when I talk to you
Do you even care what I'm going through
Your eyes stare and they're staring right through me
You are right there but it's like you never knew me
Do you even know how much it hurt
You gave up on me to be with her
And the revenge is sweeter than you ever were

I'm so mad at you right now
I can't even find the words
And you're on the way down
I can't wait to see you burn
You try to make me hate that girl
When I should be hating you
And what the hell is wrong with you

Nothing can save you now that it's over
I guess that you'll find out when you're no one
Don't say you're sorry now â€˜cause I just don't care
Nothing can save you now nothing
Nothing can save you now nothing
Chorus
