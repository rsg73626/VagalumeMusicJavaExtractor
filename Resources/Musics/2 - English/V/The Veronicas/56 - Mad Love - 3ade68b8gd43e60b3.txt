MAD LOVE

It's kinda cool in your company
it's kinda hot when you're mad at me
you know I hate it when I lose a fight
but I'll let you make it up to me tonight
I take you places you've never been
you make me shiver when you touch my skin
and then there's days that you don't come around
I'm running trying to chase you down

we got that L. o. v. e the kind that makes you mad
I put up with your crazy cause I'm your better half
I think I like the challenge because I love to win
you know you got the talent, pressing all my buttons in

I knew you were trouble from the day I met ya
one look in your eyes and I could not forget ya
you got me feeling ooh
you got me feeling ooh
mad, mad love

trouble from the day I met ya
got me seeing double
how could I forget ya?
you got me feeling ooh
you got me feeling ooh
mad, mad love

I can take it baby, that's alright
you can't love without a little fight
I really wanna be with your man
you're such a pain to try and understand
but the way you lay it down on me
I get weak and it's hard to speak
I got a feeling you cast a spell
I slipped and then I fell

we got that L. o. v. e the kind that makes you mad
I put up with your crazy cause I'm your better half
I think I like the challenge because I love to win
you know you got the talent, pressing all my buttons in

I knew you were trouble from the day I met ya
one look in your eyes and I could not forget ya
you got me feeling ooh
you got me feeling ooh
mad, mad love

trouble from the day I met ya
got me seeing double
how could I forget ya?
you got me feeling ooh
you got me feeling ooh
mad, mad love

we got that L. o. v. e the kind that will make you mad
I put up with your crazy cause I'm your better half
I think I like the challenge because I love to win
you know you got the talent, pressing all my buttons in

I knew you were trouble from the day I met ya
one look in your eyes and I could not forget ya
you got me feeling ooh
you got me feeling ooh
mad, mad love

trouble from the day I met ya
got me seeing double
how could I forget ya?
you got me feeling ooh
you got me feeling ooh
mad, mad love
