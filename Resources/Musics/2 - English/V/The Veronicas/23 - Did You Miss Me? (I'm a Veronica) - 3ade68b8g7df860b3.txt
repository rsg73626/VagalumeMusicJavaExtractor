DID YOU MISS ME? (I'M A VERONICA)

I'm a Veronica

Back with a vengeance, back with a song
All you motherfuckers got it wrong
I'm the villain, I'm the one
I was born just to take you on
Open your eyes and step in the ring
Float like a butterfly, me I sting
I'm a Snow White with a gun
I'll shoot you down, bang bang
You're done

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?
So baby tell me, did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was done?
(I'm a Veronica)
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners ooh ooh
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners ooh ooh

From my homeland to Hong Kong
By the time you'll find me I'll be gone
Bet you never thought I'd hit like that
Looks like hell, just got back
My best friends, my enemy
Oh woe is me, I'll kill 'em one by one
And if you get in my face then you'll get a taste
Even God would want some

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was done?
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners ooh ooh
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners ooh ooh
(I'm a Veronica)

I'm on mission to the stars
I'm another child living life on Mars
I'm the next kid in line for the throne
Ascend as you let me
And I won't stop 'til I run this town
When the sick step down then I'll bring you out
'Cause if I'm not what you wanna be
Then what's the bag about for me
'Cause I don't need to follow you down

'Cause I am so into dancing
My whole life I'm goin' and goin'
There's a bitch you know this bitch
My body keeps twirlin' and twirlin'
'Cause I am so into dancing
My whole life I'm goin' and goin'
There's a bitch you know this bitch
My body keeps twirlin' and twirlin'

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?
So baby tell me, did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was done?
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners ooh ooh
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners ooh ooh
