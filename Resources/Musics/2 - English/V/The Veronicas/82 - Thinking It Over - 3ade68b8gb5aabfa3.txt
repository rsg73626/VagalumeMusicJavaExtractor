THINKING IT OVER

Just imagine that you have nothing done
Your life is so messed up and everything went wrong
Didn't know which way to go or what to do
And now I've lost my mind, we're out of time
I just gotta think it through

Now the time has come for me to start taking control of my life
I gave my way, I'll see it through, it's just what I wanna do

I'm thinking it over
Lost in my mind
The reasons are things that I cannot find
Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me
This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel

How would you feel if I told you
The truth of my life
Like my mum and I fight
While my dad drinks himself to sleep every night
I know you've heard it all before
And you've probably been through it yourself

Now the time has come for me to start taking control of my life
I gave my way, I'll see it through, it's just what I wanna do

I'm thinking it over
Lost in my mind
The reasons are things that I cannot find
Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me
This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel

Done all my thinking
I'm moving focus
And I've finally figured I'm worth at least something
Truth though it hurts, it's right
I can't give up the fight
Can't give up the fight

Now I need you [something] falling from the sky
Use my guardian eye; and it's there for you

I'm thinking it over
Lost in my mind
The reasons are things that I cannot find
Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me
This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel

I'm thinking it over
Lost in my mind
The reasons are things that I cannot find
Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me
This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel
