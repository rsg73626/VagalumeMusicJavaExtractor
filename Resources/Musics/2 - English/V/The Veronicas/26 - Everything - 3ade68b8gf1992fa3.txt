EVERYTHING

I want you mine
Cause when i see your eyes
I'm wanting you to stay
When you're running away

Cause when you hold my hand
I try to pretend
I'm not feeling like i do
do you feel it too ?

When I close my eyes i see you
Don't tell me this is wrong

Refrão:
Cause everything, everything 
Makes me think of you
And everything, everything 
That I wanna do
I know you gets it 
when you look at me
I want you 
so tell me now
Do you, do you 
want me too?

When i see you out
I lie to my self
I hang on what she says
Is perfect in my head

Don't wanna go too far
Find out who you are
I'm too close to turn around
I think i figured you out

And I want so bad to kiss you
Don't tell me that i'm wrong

Refrão

Am I crazy
I feel lost in time
You confuse me
Have I lost my mind ?

Refrão
