DON'T SAY GOODBYE

I'm Lying here
Thinkin' 'bout you
No More tears
Fighting for you
So Don't throw it in my face, in my face
I know what I did to you
And don't make me feel guilty
Keep blaming me
I still want you

Ohhh
Ohhh

All Cried out
Pleading with you
Dying now
Don't say that we're through
I'd rather you hate me than break me
Youre all I ever knew
Now hold on cause
I'll try to save us
Im still in love with you
(Still love you still love)

Ohhh
Ohhh

Don't say goodbye
Don't Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't Don't say goodbye

Ohhh
Ohhh

Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye...
