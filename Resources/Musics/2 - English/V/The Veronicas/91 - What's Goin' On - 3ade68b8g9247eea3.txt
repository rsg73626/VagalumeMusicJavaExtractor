WHAT'S GOIN' ON

It's 3 a.m.
I start to cry
I'm alone again
I try so hard not to fall in love
But here I am
And you couldn't even pretend
That you cared if this was the end

CHORUS:
All the things you said to me
Won't even matter
Do what you want
'Cause I'm not gonna save you baby
What's goin' on?
We don't care
We don't fight
We don't even know what's wrong or right now baby
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

There's nothing else I can say
What can I do?
We might have worked out someday
But it takes two
And you couldn't even pretend
That you cared if this was the end

REPEAT CHORUS

What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?
All the things you said to me
Won't even matter

And i couldn't even pretend
That I care if this is the end

REPEAT CHORUS 2X

But here I am
