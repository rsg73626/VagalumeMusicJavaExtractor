CROSS MY HEART

It's hard to look away from that fire in your eyes
Don't wanna hear that we're out of time
Stay here next to me
I was hurt, you brought me back to life
No, I don't wanna make it stop
No, I don't wanna give you up

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words
Hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down
We've got a love that lasts forever
We've got a love that lasts forever

Don't wanna hear it when they say we're too young
You're what I need
Like a secret locked away too long
You have set me free
I was broken, didn't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna make it stop
No, I don't wanna give you up

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words
Hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down
We've got a love that lasts forever
We've got a love that lasts forever

I couldn't stand to see another hand upon you
Let me hold you for life
I will always be by your side

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words
Hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down
We've got a love that lasts forever
We've got a love that lasts forever

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words
Hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down
We've got a love that lasts forever
We've got a love that lasts forever
