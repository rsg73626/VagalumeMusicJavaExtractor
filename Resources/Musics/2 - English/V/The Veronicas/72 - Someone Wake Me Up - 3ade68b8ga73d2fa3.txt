SOMEONE WAKE ME UP

We got the same friends
We're gonna have to see each other eventually
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that
My cds are at your place
And you know i'm gonna have to pick them up
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that

Even though it was mutual, it still kills inside
Cause for so long, how i've been defined

It feels just like i'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Can someone wake me up
Never thought that we'd go under
I guess we won't be making love
And if this is a dream i wonder
Can someone wake me up

I still have your old shirt
Y'know the one i said i'd thrown away
I put it on when i went to bed last night
Baby, is this where our story ends
When i turn out the light
Fantasy and reality fight

Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up

Even though it's over now
It still kills inside
Cause for so long you have been my life

Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up
