BABY I'M READY

You can chase me
I'm running down, I'm running do-own
No escaping
I've got you now, I've got you no-ow

So come with me and you will fight and I will take you down
Oh oh oh oh
I've got a place I can find where you can lose your self control

Baby I'm ready to do what I want
I'm ready to do what I want
Baby I'm ready to do what I want

I'm ready to do what I want
Baby I'm ready to do what I want
Baby I'm ready
Baby I'm ready now

You can't blame me
'Cuz I run the town, I run the to-own
No complaining
'Cuz I've got you now, I've got you no-ow

So come with me and you will fight and I will take you down
Oh oh oh oh
I've got a place I can find where you can lose your self control

Baby I'm ready to do what I want
I'm ready to do what I want
Baby I'm ready to do what I want
I'm ready to do what I want
Baby I'm ready
Baby I'm ready now
Baby I'm ready to do what I want

We're on my ride now
Come on boy
Let's come and find her
