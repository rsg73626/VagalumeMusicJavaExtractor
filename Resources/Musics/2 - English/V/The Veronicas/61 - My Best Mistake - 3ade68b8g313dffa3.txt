MY BEST MISTAKE

I wish my heart would like me
I wish you were sitting here beside me
I wonder if we're dreaming
I could meet you
I think about you when he holds my hand
It's just to be with you when I can
How I could get myself in such a mess
Please ignore you

Any green eyed prince could tell
That I've lost control of me
And I'm hoping there's no way out
Tonight

I should
Forget you
I don't
Regret you
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
I wish you'd never let me make the mistake
If we fall back then I wouldn't let you
You were my best mistake

I'm running just to see your face
Do you remember we're those crazy kids
Nowhere I'd rather be than right here with you

Any green eyed prince could tell
That I've lost control of me
And I'm hoping there's no way out
Tonight

I should
Forget you
And I don't
Regret you
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
I wish you'd never let me make the mistake
If we fall back then I wouldn't let you
You were my best mistake

I can't, I can't let you
Would I, would I find you
My mistake
I can't, I can't taste you
We're not, we're not meant to be

I should
Forget you
And I don't
Regret you
I should
Forget you
And I don't
Regret you
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
I wish you'd never let me make the mistake
If we fall back then I wouldn't let you
You were my best mistake
