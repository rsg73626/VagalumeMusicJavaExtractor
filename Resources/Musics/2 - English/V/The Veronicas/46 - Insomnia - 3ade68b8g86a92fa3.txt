INSOMNIA

I can’t sleep most of the time
Try to cancel you from my mind
Never liked you that much anyway
Like to try to sleep through to Saturday
Can’t seem to keep my eyes shut
Can’t stop to think about what
You said, you said to me when
I lost, I lost you again

Can’t make the beat go away
Gotta get me out, I can't stay
Gotta feel the rush in my veins

I’m lonely, gotta look for a party
To dance with somebody tonight
'Cause I’m lonely, I feel empty inside
Can’t you make me feel alive

I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A
Can’t sleep
I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A
Can’t sleep

Don’t look at me like that
What, you think I’m some kind of maniac
Who was asking your opinion anyway
It’s my life and you don’t have a say
Gotta get, get out of this place
Can’t stand to look at your face
I’m gonna get lost in the underground
I’ll kill you if you follow me around

Can’t make the beat go away
Gotta get me out, I can't stay
Gotta feel the rush in my veins

I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A
Can’t sleep
I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A
Can’t sleep
