ALL ABOUT US

They say, don't trust,
You, me, we, us,
So we'll fall if we must,
Cause it's you, me,
And it's all about,
It's all about 
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
And that's the thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
We'll Run away if we must
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us
If they hurt you,
They hurt me too,
So we'll rise up,
Won't stop,
And it's all about,
It's all about,
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
And that's the thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
We'll Run away if we must
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us
They don't know,
They can't see,
Who we are,
Fear is the enemy,
Hold on tight,
Hold on to me,
'Cause tonight,
It's all about us,
It's all about, all about us
And that's the thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
And that's the thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
We'll Run away if we must
'Cause you know (ah-ah)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
