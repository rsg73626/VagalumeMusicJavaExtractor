THE WILD SIDE

(Say Ohh Ohh Ohh
Say Ohh Ohh Ohhh)

I?ll tell you ?bout a story that you wanna hear
We?re bouncing off the walls, but we don?t care
Forget about the rules, we?ll just let them slide
We?re calling all the girls from the wild side
Well I don?t want to compromise
No, I won?t this time

I know things won?t always work out like we plan
Say ohh ohh ohh
Say ohh ohh ohhh
Somehow things are gonna play out in the end
Say ohh ohh ohh
I?m sayin? ohh ohh ohhh

(Say ohh ohh ohh)

Welcome to the city where the fun won?t stop
It's time to shake the world with the sound of rock
Forget about the cost, but don?t be shy
Cause this one's for the girls with the wild side
You won?t have to compromise
No, you won?t this time
I know things won?t always work out like we plan

Say ohh ohh ohh
Say ohh ohh ohhh
Somehow things are gonna play out in the end
Say ohh ohh ohh
I?m sayin? ohh ohh ohhh

I know things won?t always work out like we plan
Say ohh ohh ohh
Say ohh ohh ohhh
Somehow things are gonna play out in the end
Say ohh ohh ohh
I?m sayin? ohh ohh ohhh
This is for the girls with the wild side
