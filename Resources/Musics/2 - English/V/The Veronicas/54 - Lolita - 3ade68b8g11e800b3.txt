LOLITA

From the mouths of babes to power of men
I'll make it all new again
Hold my hand, hold my hand cos I can't touch the ground
The carrousel goes around, round, round
The addiction, friction, it burns you alive
So illegal, no evil is seen with these eyes
I won't tell if you want it, I will if you want
Nothings is sacred, don't care if it's wrong

I'm your Lolita, La Femme Nikita
When we're together, you'll love me forever
You're my possession, I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never, I'll love you forever

Doomed from the start, we can't stay apart
Everywhere I turn I'm trapped in your heart
There's no escape, secrets keep you awake
No running away, no saving the day
Wild and exciting I'm breaking you down
You're making a comeback, I'm taking your crown
Nursery rhymes I sing in my dreams
I'm lost in the woods and you're baring your teeth

I'm your Lolita, La Femme Nikita
When we're together, you'll love me forever
You're my possession, I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never, You'll love me forever

Always stay close to me, don't think of leaving
And I promise I will keep, a secret (secret secret)

I'm your Lolita, La Femme Nikita
When we're together, you'll love me forever
You're my possession, I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never, you'll love me forever

I was, stay close to me, don't think of leaving
And I promise I will keep, a secret (secret secret)
