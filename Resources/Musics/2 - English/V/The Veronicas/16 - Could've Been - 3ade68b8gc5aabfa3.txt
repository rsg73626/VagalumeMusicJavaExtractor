COULD'VE BEEN

Do you ever wish that she was me?
Ever close your eyes and think about what could’ve been
Could’ve been

I find it hard to breathe
When I sleep at night you haunt me inside my dreams
Inside my dreams

Look at me in my eyes
And tell me that you feel nothing inside
‘Cause I can wash you off my skin
But I can’t see you either again

Do you ever wish that she was me
Rather left here missing you not missing me
Missing me

Look at me in my eyes
And tell me that you feel nothing inside
‘Cause I can wash you off my skin
But I can’t see you ever again

So I’ll forget I love you
I don’t want you anymore
I’ll keep on life and screw myself cause we could’ve had it all
You should keep pretending that all it’s just a phase
And you look me in the eye and say “It’s worth it in the end”

Look at me and tell me lies
Tell me that you feel nothing inside
‘Cause I can wash you off my skin
But I can’t see you ever again

You, you

Do you ever wish that she was me?
