LET ME OUT

I can't take the blame
I can't take the pain
If you're gonna let me down
Just do it now, just let me down

I'm too scared to sleep
To see you in my dreams
If you're gonna make me cry
Just do it right and make me cry

Never knew much it'd hurt you to keep me
You don't even know if you really need me
How can I fight when love is the enemy?
I don't exist until you release me

If you think it's over
If you think we're nowhere, just let me out
I'm making it easy
For you to go, leave me, just let me out

You dig your claws in deep
I'm way out, breaking free
You can't keep this alive
For me to survive, push me to the side

And I can't run if you're coming on to me
And I can't hide when you've got what's left of me
You leave it unsaid
It's all in my head,
We're better off dead

Never knew much it'd hurt you to keep me
You don't even know if you really need me
How can I fight when love is the enemy?
I don't exist until you release me

If you think it's over
If you think we're nowhere, just let me out
I'm making it easy
For you to go, leave me, just let me out

If you think it's over
If you think we're nowhere, just let me out
I'm making it easy
For you to go, leave me, just let me out

I can't take the blame
I can't take your pain
If you're gonna let me down
Just do it now, let me down

If you think it's over
If you think we're nowhere, just let me out
I'm making it easy
For you to go, leave me, just let me out

If you think it's over
If you think we're nowhere, just let me out
I'm making it easy
For you to go, leave me, just let me out

If you think it's over
If you think we're nowhere, just let me out
I'm making it easy
For you to go, leave me, just let me out
