TEENAGE MILLIONAIRE

We don't need no money
We don't need good luck
You and me together
Is more than enough
With a love like this
Love, love like this

We could live in boxes
Babe, I wouldn't care
Mansion on a hilltop
Any-fuckin'-where
With a love like this
Love, love like this

You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a famous love affair
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everywhere they stop and stare
Yeah, they all want what we got
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire

We don't need no jet plane
We don't need no ride
Baby, when you kiss me
Feel like I could fly
With a love like this
Love, love like this

You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a famous love affair
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everywhere they stop and stare
Yeah, they all want what we got
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
Boy, when you touch me I turn into gold
Feel like (a teenage millionaire)
Boy, when you kiss me you're rulin' my world
Feel like (a teenage millionaire)

A teenage millionaire
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a famous love affair
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everywhere they stop and stare
Yeah, they all want what we got
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like a teenage millionaire
