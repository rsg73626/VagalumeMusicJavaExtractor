MAKE IT HOT

On the floor
You’re looking so fine
There’s people dancing,
When you take your hand in mine
(hand in mine)
Moving to the rhythm,
Of the song
We’ll dance all night,
Until the morning light,
Until the evenings still young..
[Chorus]
Can you let me be the one tonight?
The only one,
Cuz baby this feels right
Gimme a chance to show you what I got
You know we go, together so
Tonight lets make it hot
Ohh yeahh
We will salsa, we’ll slumber, we’ll run and we’ll rumba,
Until we bring the season into bring the season into the summer heat
The sweat on our bodies makes the moment complete
Baby, let’s take this to extreme
As you’re touching me outside
Feel the tremble deep inside
And the look that’s in your eyes
It’s saying
“Baby that’s right”
[Chorus]
Can you let me be the one tonight?
The only one,
Cuz baby this feels right
Gimme a chance to show you what I got
You know we go, together so
Tonight let’s make it hot
Baby it’s in you to fall in love with me
Don’t be afraid, just give and you’ll receive
Gimme a chance to show you what I got
You know we go, together so
Tonight let’s make it hot
Baby, there’s more thing that’s alright
Cuz this just can’t only be one night
I never want to say goodbye
Cuz this is the best night of my life..
[Chorus]
Can you let me be the one tonight?
The only one,
Cuz baby this feels right
Gimme a chance to show you what I got
You know we go, together so
Tonight let’s make it hot
Baby it’s in you to fall in love with me
Don’t be afraid, just give and you’ll receive
Gimme a chance to show you what I got
You know we go, together so
Tonight let’s make it hot
