SPIRITS AND SIN

I feel the walls caving in
I feel my future growing thin
I see you now the way you've been
While the clock's been ticking
I feel the moon pulling me in
I feel the spirits in the sin
You sold me out but I crawled back in
Yeah my heart's still ticking

I can't control what you do to me
But I control what I do to you
You are the mess with spirits and sin
Go on try and i will win
You don't know what you do to me
But I know what I do to you
I see the future come on in
You wanna play me I will win

I'm moving slowly with the wind
I feel the power of my skin
I make you won't me I make you swim
While I watch you Sinking
I see the lights growing down
I see you drowning and I want you again
you talk is big but the truth is thin
yeah you're quickly sinking

I can't control what you do to me
But I control what I do to you
You are the mess with spirits and sin
Go on try and I will win
You don't know what you do to me
But I know what I do to you
I see the future come on in
You wanna play me I will win

Less you so less you so less you so
â€˜Cos now we knows now we knows how it goes
When you put your sticking fingers
Were they don't belong
