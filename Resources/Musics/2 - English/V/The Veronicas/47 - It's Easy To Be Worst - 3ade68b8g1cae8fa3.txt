IT'S EASY TO BE WORST

I needed to see, just needed to see
If I'd be sorry
Like I wanted to be
I'm hating to be the guilty party
The one on my knees
I never wanted to be

But I'm not gonna tell him anything
No I'm not gonna tell him anything at all

Who knows? I'm well-rehearsed
I'll keep it up just to come first
It's easy to be worst
And I'm not gonna tell him anything at all

You know it's easy to see
You always get yourself in the worst scenarios
Never know where to go
How to keep it in tow
Any chance it comes out, you follow your doubts
Until you figure it out
And then you scream and you shout

Should I turn my back on this?
Is it wrong not to confess?
All I keep coming up with is this
Should I turn my back on this?
Is it wrong not to confess?
All I keep coming up with is this

But I'm not gonna tell him anything
No I'm not gonna tell him anything at all

Who knows? I'm well-rehearsed
And I'll keep it up just to come first
It's easy to be worst
And I'm not gonna tell him anything at all

(I'm not, I'M NOT)
I'm not gonna tell him anything
('Cause what he doesn't know won't hurt him, 
What he doesn't know won't hurt him at all)
No I'm not gonna tell him anything at all
(I'm not, I'M NOT)

Who knows? 
I'm well-rehearsed, and I'll keep it up just to come first
('Cause what he doesn't know won't hurt him, 
What he doesn't know won't hurt him at all)
It's easy to be worst, and I'm not gonna tell him
anything at all

(I'm not, I'M NOT)
I'm not gonna tell him anything
('Cause what he doesn't know won't hurt him, 
What he doesn't know won't hurt him at all)
No I'm not gonna tell him anything at all
(I'm not, I'M NOT)

Who knows? I'm well-rehearsed, and I'll keep it up
just to come first
('Cause what he doesn't know won't hurt him,
What he doesn't know won't hurt him at all)
It's easy to be worst, and I'm not gonna tell him
anything at all

What he doesn't know won't hurt him at all
And I'm not gonna tell him
