REVOLUTION

I am temperamental, like a heart without a home 
I am sentimental, but you don't know me at all 
I have expectations, I wanna be the one you call 
I want a conversation, but you don't know me at all 

Hold on tight, I am, I'm a revolution 
Close your eyes, I am (I am) I am (I am) 
I'll blow your mind, I am, I'm a revolution 
Why do I have to explain 
Who I am again and again 

I know what you're thinking 
I can tell what you're waiting for 
But I think that you're pretending 
But you don't fool me at all 
If you knew me at all, you'd take my picture 
And you'd hang it on your wall 

Hold on tight, I am, I'm a revolution 
Close your eyes, I am (I am) I am (I am) 
I'll blow your mind, I am, I'm a revolution 
Why do I have to explain 
Who I am again and again 

I didn't know that you've been wanting me 
Oh how's a girl supposed to know 
Just when you think that it's all tragedy 
Don't worry baby I'll go slow 

Hold on tight, I am, I'm a revolution 
Close your eyes, I am (I am) I am (I am) 
I'll blow your mind, I am, I'm a revolution 
Why do I have to explain (why do I have to explain) 
Who I am again and again 

Hold on tight, I am, I'm a revolution 
Close your eyes, I am (I am) I am (I am) 
I'll blow your mind, I am, I'm a revolution 
Why do I have to explain 
Who I am again and again 

I am
