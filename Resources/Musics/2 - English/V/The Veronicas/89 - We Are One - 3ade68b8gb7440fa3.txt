WE ARE ONE

Don't know what we're fighting for 
Who'd have known we'd fall 
A second's too late 
Crashed down 1 foot below the ground 
Did you hear the sound 
Of a smile that is fading 
When will it go? 
When will it stop? 
There's a whirlwind in my head 
A part of me still lives for you 
so don't ever forget 

CHORUS: 
Cause i belong 
I believe 
We are one 
You and me 
But we keep on falling 
Into silence 
Out of love 
Out of time 
what will it take 
Till you realize? 
'Cause you know it's killing me 
To be left unseen 

Hey you 
What's running through your head 
It's cupid lying dead 
While I'm sitting here waiting 
And all the stupid little things 
That belong to you and me 
Will you really throw them all away? 

CHORUS: 
Cause i belong 
I believe 
We are one 
You and me 
But we keep on falling 
Into silence 
Out of love 
Out of time 
what will it take 
Till you realize? 
'Cause you know it's killing me 
To be left unseen


I'm the one that's been tryin'
You left it all up to me
And I won't waste another day
'Til you believe
that maybe I've been mistaken
and didn't you ever need
is the truth behind the words you said to me

But we keep on falling into silence 
Out of love 
Out of time 
what will it take 
Till you realize? 
'Cause you know it's killing me 
To be left unseen

Cause i belong 
I believe 
We are one 
You and me
'Cause you know it's killing me
To be left uneen.
