TO KNOW HIM

Everyone knew him,
But they never really knew him at all.
Everyday I would sit next to him,
But we'll never talk.

Then I heard your name on the 6 o'clock news,
There was a million thoughts just running through my head.
How can something like these happen to you?
Now I wish you knew...

(Chorus)
I give up forever just to see you again,
And I, I walk the world to understand
How we almost could have been
If only I have let you in.

I wanna to know him,
But I couldn't think in something to say.
So I let the moment pass me by
And now regrettitude stay.

Then I heard your name on the 6 o'clock news,
A rush of cold is running through my vains.
How can something like these happen to you?
Now I wish you knew...

(Chorus)
I give up forever just to see you again,
And I, I walk the world to understand
How we almost could have been
If only I have let you in.

I wish I had the chance to say,
I wish I knew you,
I didn't think as you walked away
I'll never see you,
I won't forget, but it's too late.
And now I miss you!

Then I heard your name on the 6 o'clock news,
And in one day you suddenly have gone.
How can something like these happen to you?
Now I wish you knew...

(Chorus)
I give up forever just to see you again,
And I, I walk the world to understand
How we almost could have been. (3x)

If only I have let you in. (2x)
