WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT

We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it... anymore.

We've got the right to choose and
there aint no way we're losin
This is our life
this is our song.
We'll fight the powers that be just
don't pick our destiny cuz
You don't know us, you don't belong.

We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.
We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.

Oh youre so condesending,
your gore is never ending,
we dont want nothing- not a thing from you
Your life is trife and jaded- boring and confiscated.
If thats your best- your best won't do

We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.
We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.

o-o-o o-o-o we're right
[yeah] we're free
[yeah] we'll fight
[yeah] you'll see
[yeah]

We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.

NO more!
NO more!
NO more!

We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.
We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.
We're not gonna take it
no we aint gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it...
anymore.
