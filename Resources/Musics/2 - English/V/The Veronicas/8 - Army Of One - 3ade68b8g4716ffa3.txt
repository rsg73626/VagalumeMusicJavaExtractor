ARMY OF ONE

It's unspoken
My heart is broken
Calling for freedom
Where are we going
Open the same door
We always want more
Everyone's searching
It's something to die for

In the end
Love was down
And as long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one
An army of one

Have we forgotten
Too busy running
All of the sudden
We left falling
This is our moment
Wherever there's an ocean
We try to cross it
But we drown in emotion

In the end
Love was down
And as long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one
An army of one

How,how do we win
When we are so
So far gone
When we know
Where we've been
Can we ever make it
Back to the start

In the end
Love was down
And as long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one

In the end
Love was down
And as long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one
An army of one
