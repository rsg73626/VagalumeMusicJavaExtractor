STAY

Watch you walk away 
I didn't say the words I wanted to say
Now I'm sitting all alone 
thinking about the times I had you here to hold
Giving you my reasons why 
I feel this way when we say goodbye

But I won't run around after you
And you know what you found 
and you know I'm in love with you
Everything changes when I see your smile, 
so stay a little while

I miss you even more today 
Knowing you're so far away
You tell me that you'll see me soon 
but tell me just how long I have to wait for you
Giving you my reasons why 
asking to you stay tonight

But I won't run around after you
And you know what you found 
and you know I'm in love with you
Everything changes when I see your smile, 
so stay a little while

But I won't run around after you
And you know what you found 
and you know I'm in love with you
Everything changes when I see your smile, 
so stay a little while
stay a little while
