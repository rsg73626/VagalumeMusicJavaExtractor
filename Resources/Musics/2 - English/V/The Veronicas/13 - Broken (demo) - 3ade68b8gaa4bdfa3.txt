BROKEN (DEMO)

Sometimes I wonder if you even care
It's the way that you act like I'm not even there
And you know that's not how it was supposed to be
So I'm opening your eyes for you to finally see me


I am broken inside
And if I said I was invincible I lie
And I can't do do this anymore 'cause I've tried

Now I'm broken

Today turn out just like yesterday
It's not what you said but what you didn't say
And now you push me further than you know
I'm waiting for the time when I can finally let go


I am broken inside
And if I said I was invincible I lie
And I can't do do this anymore 'cause I've tried

Now I'm broken


In pieces, believe me
I thought you never leave me
But this days I'm not so sure


I am broken inside
And if I said I was invincible I lie
And I can't do this anymore 'cause I've tried

Now I'm broken


I am broken inside
And if I said I was invincible I lie
And I can't do do this anymore even now I'm not so sure
I'll love myself inside
'Cause I am broken
