YOU AND ME

Hiding out in our secret place
in the cupboard where our mom wouldn't find us
making up stupid words all the day
our own escape

same face with a different name
wishing that ufos would come and find us
pointing out every small mistake
 Through each heartbreak

where did those days go?
we're all growing up so fast
I wish that we could live forever
through all the changes there is one thing that will last
it will always be 
you and me

side by side on the motel floor
waiting up for our daddy to call us
doesn't matter where we are
home's the two of us

where did those days go?
we're all growing up so fast
I wish that we could live forever
through all the changes there is one thing that will last
it will always be 
you and me

what would I do without you?
it's plain to see
we're incomplete
 Without you and me

where did those days go?
we're all growing up so fast
I wish that we could live forever
through all the changes there is one thing that will last
it will always be 
you and me
it will always be 
you and me

you and me
