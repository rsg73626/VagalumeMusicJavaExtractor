YOUR SONG

I’d never thought that I could feel this way
I’m lost for words around you today
I’m so confused cause everything changed
I know I said I hate when you get in a fight
I’ll take you down if you leave me tonight
I just don’t care if Im crossin’ the line
And if your drunk I’ll drag you home
I’d rather be if you’d be like

(Chorus)
I know that this is wrong
But this is now your song
To tell you how I feelin’
But Im down
Down here on my knees
Tellin’ you just kiss me now
And let it passes by
To let it passin’ by

You make it hard for me to pretend
Cause I see you more than just as a friend
And you should know Im your biggest fan
And if you hide and crash with me
I’ll do anything makes you

(Chorus)
I Know that this is wrong
But this is how your song
To tell you how I feelin’
But Im down
Down here on my knees
Tellin’ you just kiss me now
And let it passes by
To let it passin’ by

Tell me im insane
Tell me you don’t feel the same
Cause I can see it in your eyes (in your eyes)

And I know

(Chorus)
I Know that this is wrong
But this is now your song
To tell you how I feelin’
But I am down
Down here on my knees
Tellin’ you just kiss me now
And let it passes by
To let it passin’ by
