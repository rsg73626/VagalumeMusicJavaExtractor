NOBODY WINS

Hold your head up high
You're never wrong
Somewhere in the right
You belong
You would rather fight
Than walk away

What a lonely way
To breathe the air
What an unlovely way
To say you care
And now we're  too far gone
For me to save

And I never thought that we could come to this...

Chorus:
` Maybe there's beauty in goodbye
(No one's wrong or right, you would rather fight than walk away)
There's just no reason left to try
(Now it's gone too far, look at where we are)
You push me away
Another black day
Lost count of the reasons to cry
Now look what you've missed
Living like this
Nobody wins

Searching for the truth
In your eyes
I find myself so lost
I don't recognize
The person now that you
You claim to be

Don't know when to stop
Or when to start
You're just so caught up
In who you are
And now you're far too high
For me too see

And I never thought that we could come to this...

Repeat Chorus

You
You never say you're sorry
Try to tell me that you love me
But don't
It's too late
To take it there

Repeat Chorus
