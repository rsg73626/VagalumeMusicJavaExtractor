KICK IT IN

Go
'Cuz I don't know how to walk away
Wait
'Cuz I don't ever wanna feel this way
You
Are the only one I've ever known
And I'm
Scared of breaking, breaking

I
Always knew you'd want to be the boss
I'm gone
And I found somebody's dead rose
I thought
That I wasn't gonna get away
But you're here
And you're taken taken

It's cold and you're
Beautiful, beautiful
And I'm outside your door

Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
But I'm not gonna survive
For you I'm gonna kick it in
Go around and come on in
And I'm taking what I need

I'm terrified but I'm willing to try
I'm paralyzed but not this time
So hold the door I'm stepping in
And tonight I'm gonna kick it in

I
Said the only thing I would've said
And you
You're the chance that I wanna take
For me to feel safe
From the world outside when I'm in your arms
I'm not afraid
But I'm shaking, shaking

It's cold and you're
Beautiful, beautiful
And I'm outside your door

Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
But I'm not gonna survive
For you I'm gonna kick it in
Go around and come on in
And I'm taking what I need

I'm terrified but I'm willing to try
I'm paralyzed but I'm on your side
So hold the door I'm stepping in
Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
Yeah

I try to feel and thanks to you
I feel my amour crashing to the ground
Around the world I feel so high
All by myself

I'm gonna kick it in
And I'm not afraid to fight
For you I'm gonna kick it in
I'm coming in
And I'm taking what I need
Yeah

I'm terrified but I'm willing to try
I'm paralyzed but I'm on your side
So hold the door I'm stepping in
Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
Woah oh
Tonight I'm gonna kick it in

Hold the door coming in
Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
(Tonight I'm gonna kick it in)
It's cold out in the wind
(Woah oh)
Tonight I'm gonna kick it in
