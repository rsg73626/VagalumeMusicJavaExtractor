HOW LONG?

Saturdays will never be the same
It's even hard mentioning your name
Looking back I don't know what went wrong
Then suddenly it's like I don't belong

Chorus:
So how long must I wait
And how long must I stay
Please let me know how to live
'Cause I don't ever want to feel this way again

Nothing seems to matter anymore
Why can't it be just like it was before?
I hate you for the person I've become
Take me back to where it all begun

Repeat Chorus

Let me know how to live
Let me know

Repeat Chorus
