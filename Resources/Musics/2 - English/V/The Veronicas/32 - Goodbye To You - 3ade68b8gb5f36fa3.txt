GOODBYE TO YOU

Those times I waited for you
Seem so long ago
Now I wanna be far too much
To ever let you go

No I'll never get by
I feel it too
And I guess I can never
Stand to lose
Touch of it and say...

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you

How could I have loved someone
Like the one I see in you
And remember the good times baby
Now and the bad times too

These last few weeks
I'm holdin on
It takes a toll
And the nights are long
Guess its better to say...

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you

Cause baby its over now
No need to talk about it
Its not the same (its not the same)
My love for you's just not the same

And my heart
And my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love
And my love
And my love

And my love

Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you

How could I have loved someone
Like the one I see in you
And remember the good times baby
Now and the bad times too

These last few weeks
I'm holdin on
It takes a toll
And the nights are long
Guess its better to say...

Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you

Goodbye to you
