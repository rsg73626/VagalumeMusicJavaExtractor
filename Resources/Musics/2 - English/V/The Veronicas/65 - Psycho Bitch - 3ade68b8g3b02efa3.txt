PSYCHO BITCH

You’re beautiful
You get me
We’re so alike
It scares me
You read my mind
You speak my words
When I’m down
You make it hurt

Think about
The things that you said
Think about
How much you suck
Psycho bitch
You’re a fucking freak
You’re so sick
You turn me on
You’re so sick
You turn me on

Blue eyes
Laugh at me
The way they fall
All over me
You’re always wrong
You’re always right
I told you yes
And please don’t bite

I hate you now
You piece of shit
You think you’re good
I think you suck
You’re a psycho bitch
You’re alone and god
You’re so sick
You turn me on
You’re so sick
You turn me on

When you say that you need me
But you’re really just wasting all my time
When you say that you need me
But you’re really just wasting all my time
‘cuz you’re a psycho bitch
Why should we kiss?
Yeah you’re a psycho bitch

Ohhhhhhh
You’re you’re a psycho something
Ohhhhhhh oh oh
Oh no
No babe

Or when your eyes are looking
We’re so alike
It scares me
