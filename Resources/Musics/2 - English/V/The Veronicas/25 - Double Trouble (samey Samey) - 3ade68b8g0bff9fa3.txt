DOUBLE TROUBLE (SAMEY SAMEY)

We look the same yeah we look the same
We're twins so we look the same oh yeah
Freaky twins gonna freak you out
Tell me this doesn't freak you out
We wear our school uniforms all weekend
Even though we left school years ago
We both can't pronounce our surname
It's orglili dili lili lilili asso
Oooooooh
We don't even know each other (we don't)
That's why we wear nametags
Did you know that twins speak their own language

Gotta look the same gotta look the same
gotta stand together and almost pash but not
Samey samey same same samey same same

What's a word that rhymes with same?

Oh i like this

I like this a lot
Same same same
It's the same word though
same

We don't even know each other (wich one am I)
That's why we wear name tags
Can't tell one from the other
Just ask our stunt double
We are double trouble do not burst our bubble seeing double
I don't know which room to sleep in
Samey samey same same samey same same
does anybody know we're twins?

Lisa: your arm was my arm once
Jess: tshhhhh gross... gross
Lisa: your tongue was my tongue
Jess: don't no
Lisa: it's true
Jess: that's not true
