WITHOUT LOVE

Did I say something wrong
Why are you mad at me?
Is there something you don't like about me?
baby you're to wan I think

You got behind my back
telling all my friends
That you hate the way I look
You really can't stand me
You tried to bring me down 
When I'm reaching out my hand
Do you really think that it's worth it in the end?

Without Love
Without Love
Without Love
Without Love

We never gonna make it
No we never gonna make it
no no

If I'd make you face to face
Maybe we can talk it out
If you put yourself in my place
Would you like it if i put you down?

Show me who you are 
You don't even know me
When I turn my back 
You always talk about me
Pretending you don't hear me
When I set it straight
Make it more than clear
I'm the one you love to hate.

Without Love
Without Love
Without Love
Without Love

We never gonna make it
No we never gonna make it 
No No

How do you sleep at night
When you know we're here to right
Be careful what you say
(Better) think before it's too late

Without Love
Without Love
Without Love
Without Love

We never gonna make it
No we never gonna make it
No
