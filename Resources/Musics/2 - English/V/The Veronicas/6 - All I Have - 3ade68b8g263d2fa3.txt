ALL I HAVE

I was missing you
You were miles away
He was close to me
I let him stay
Then I closed my eyes
He almost felt the same
But when the morning broke
I cried out your name
If I'd only known
It would break us
I'd done anything just to save us

(Chorus)

'Cause you're all I have
When the world comes down on me
You're the one I love
And I'm begging you to see
You're all, you're all, you're all I have
You are, you are the one I love
You're all, you're all, you're all I have

You've forgiven me
But it doesn't change
The guilt I feel when you mention his name
No more innocence
How to trust again
Wanna believe that you won't do the same
And every time we fight
We're getting closer
I slowly die inside
I'm scared it's over

(Chorus)

Your love for me was always there
Maybe too much for me to care
Now that I know I messed it up
I'd give my all to take it back

(chorus)
