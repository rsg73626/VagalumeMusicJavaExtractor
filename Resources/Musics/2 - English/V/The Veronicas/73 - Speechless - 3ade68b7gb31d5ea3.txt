SPEECHLESS

Feels like I have always known you 
And I swear I dreamed about you 
All those endless nights I was alone 
It's like I've spent forever searching 
Now I know that it was worth it 
With you it feels like I am finally home 

Fallin' head over heels 
Thought I knew how it feels 
But with you it's like the first day of my life 

'Cause you leave me speechless when you talk to me 
You leave me breathless the way you look at me 
You manage to disarm me, my soul is shining through 
Can't help but surrender, my everything to you 

Oh 

I thought I could resist you 
I thought that I was strong 
Somehow you are different from what I've known 
I didn't see it coming 
You took me by surprise and 
You stole my heart before I could say no 

Fallin' head over heels 
Thought I knew how it feels 
But with you it's like the first day of my life 

You leave me speechless when you talk to me 
You leave me breathless the way you look at me 
You manage to disarm me, my soul is shining through 
Can't help but surrender, oh no, my everything to you 

Oh no 

You leave me speechless 

The way you smile, the way you touched my face 

You leave me breathless 

There's something that you do, I can't explain 

I'd run a million miles just to hear you say my name 
Baby 

You leave me speechless when you talk to me 
You leave me breathless the way you look at me 
You manage to disarm me, my soul is shining through 
Can't help but surrender, oh no, my everything to you
