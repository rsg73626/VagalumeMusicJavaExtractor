TAKE ME ON THE FLOOR

The lights are out and I barely know you
We're going up and the place is slowing down
I knew you'd come around
You captivated me, something about you's got me
I was lonely now you make me feel alive
Will you be mine tonight

Take me on the floor
I can't take it any more
I want you I want you I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor
I can give you more
You kill me you kill me you kill me with your touch

My heart is racing as you're moving closer
You take me higher with every breath I take
Would it be wrong to stay

One look at you and I know what you're thinking
Time's a bitch and my heart is sinking down

You turn me inside out

Take me on the floor
I can't take it any more
I want you I want you I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor
I can give you more
You kill me you kill me you kill me with your touch

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a boy
I wanna...
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a boy
I wanna kiss kiss kiss kiss

Take me on the floor
I can't take it any more
I want you I want you I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor
I can give you more
You kill me 
you kill me 
you kill me please don't stop
