DEAD COOL

I'm gonna tell you a story
About a time
You remind me a story
I drove you crazy
You drove me right off the wall
You tell me hi and then hold me
You're in and you're in and out

You tell me how to try but don't know the roll
You build me up and you run 'cuz you're dead cool
You're just another way to turn me on
Gotta turn up the rock 'cuz you're dead cool

Under the spell of a gypsy
A wanted man
Who has to love in a hurry
He calls me up just to bail him out
But there's a turn around in a fury
You're in and you're in and out

You tell me how to try but don't know the roll
You build me up and you run 'cuz you're dead cool
You're just another way to turn me on
Gotta turn up the rock 'cuz you're dead cool
You tell me how to try but don't know the roll
You build me up and you run 'cuz you're dead cool
You're just another way to turn me on
Gotta turn up the rock 'cuz you're dead cool

Never stay in one place for too long you say
Baby I've gotta run 'cuz I'm dead cool
Silly things I know and they're never done
I've got plans on to come 'cuz I'm dead cool

You tell me how to try but don't know the roll
You build me up and you run 'cuz you're dead cool
You're just another way to turn me on
Gotta turn up the rock 'cuz you're dead cool
You tell me how to try but don't know the roll
You build me up and you run 'cuz you're dead cool
You're just another way to turn me on
Gotta turn up the rock 'cuz you're dead cool
