HAPPENING AGAIN

Another lonely night 
Without you by my side
Trying to stop myself from getting close to you
You are in my head again but wish we were just friends
But I know I’ll change my mind again
I’ll never see you differently

Cause it’s happening again
I think of what you said to me
And now I can’t go back to how we used to be
I tried to run and hide
Push my emotions aside 
Cause I can’t face the fact 
the one good thing I found I can't have

They've seen the way I'm right
And I don’t wanna fight
But they can see the way he makes me feel
The way he touch my face, I want him everyday
I wish there was a way to make you see
Can’t to tell, it’s killing me

Hate waking up at night
And knowing you are not there
Without you nothing's right 
Baby I just need you here

Another lonely night
I don’t have you here by my side
I have to let you slip away
I gotta get you out of my mind
