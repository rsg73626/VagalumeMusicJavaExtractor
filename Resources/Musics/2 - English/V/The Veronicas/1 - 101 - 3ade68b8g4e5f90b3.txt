101

You are the one that changed me
You are the one that keeps me open
Right from the start oh baby
I couldn't keep my heart from floatin
Up up up to far away to see
How your love is got the best of me
Can't get enough and I don't want to
I wanna hear you

You
You
You
You

Say that I'm the one that you can't get outta your head
You wanna marry me and keep me safe from harm
Say were gonna stick together through it all and live till were 101
And die in each others arms
We can take are time
We know love is hard to find
Say you're coming back for me
That you made a mistake and I'm the only one
She doesn't turn you on

I keep the last night frozen
If I could only adjust your memory
I could make you love me if you could give her up
Just give her up and take me
Down down down to far below to see
How your love has got the best of me
Can't get enough and I don't want to I wanna hear you

You
You
You
You

Say that I'm the one that you can't get outta your head
You wanna marry me and keep me safe from harm
Say were gonna stick together through it all and live till were 101
And die in each others arms
We can take are time
We know love is hard to find
Say you're coming back for me
That you made a mistake and I'm the only one
She doesn't turn you on

She doesn't turn you on
She doesn't turn you on
She she she no she she doesn't turn you

I'll wait around if I have to stay here until she's gone

Gone

You can always have me you can't let me go

Say that I'm the one that you can't get outta your head
You wanna marry me and keep me safe from harm
Say were gonna stick together through it all and live till were 101
And die in each others arms
We can take are time
We know love is hard to find
Say you're coming back for me
That you made a mistake and I'm the only one

Only one
Only one
Only one

No she doesn't turn you
