MORE LIKE ME

I'm sorry your name doesn't touch his lips
I know it kills you to find out like this
And I think you're crazy
To let him slip through your hands
I heard you're waiting around
But you don't stand a chance

The truth hurts
And someday you will see
If you were more like me
You would've kissed a little longer
Held on a little tighter
You would never let him be

If you were more like me
You'd heat him a little hotter
Touch his heart a little deeper
With a love that makes you be
If you were more like me

I see where you are
From the other side of a broken heart
You don't make me nervous from where I stand
There's no competition
Don't you know who I am?
With me he's a better man
The truth hurts
And someday you will see

If you were more like me
You would've kissed a little longer
Held on a little tighter
You would never let him be
If you were more like me
You'd heat him a little hotter
Touch his heart a little deeper
With a love that makes you be

You've been hanging on long enough
You can chase like you can keep up
Shoulda scream a little louder
Put in a little closer
Got to on one knee

If you were more like me
You'd fight a little harder
You would've been a little faster
Been impossible to leave
If you were more like me
You would've kissed a little longer
Held on a little tigher
You would never let him be
If you were more like me
