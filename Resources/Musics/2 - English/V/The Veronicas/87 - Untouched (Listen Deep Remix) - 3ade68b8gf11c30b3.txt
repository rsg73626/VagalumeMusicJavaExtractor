UNTOUCHED (LISTEN DEEP REMIX)

I go you go ahh ahh
La la la la
La la la la
I can la la la la la la
I wanna wanna wanna get get get
What I want, dont stop

Gimme, gimme, gimme whatcha got got
Cuz I can't wait wait wait any more more more
Don't even talk about the consequence
Cuz right now you're the only thing that's making any
sense to me
And I don't give a damn what they say
Or what they think, think
Cuz you're the only one who's on my mind
I'll never ever let you leave me
I'll try to stop time forever
Never want to hear you say goodbye

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Goin' crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched
And I need you so much

See you, breathe you
I want to be you
Ah la la la, ah la la la
You can take take take take take time time
To live live
The way you gotta gotta live your life
Give me give me give me all of you you
Don't be scared
Of seeing through the loneliness
I want it more more more
Don't even think about what's right or wrong
Or wrong or right
Cuz in the end it's only you and me
And no one else is going to be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be
So even if the world falls down today
You still got me to hold you up up
And I would never let you down down

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Goin' crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched
Untouched

Untouched
Ah la la la, ah la la la
Untouched
Ah la la la, ah la la la

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Goin' crazy from the moment I met you
