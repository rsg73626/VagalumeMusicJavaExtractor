SLEEP IN SILENCE

I don't understand the way things
happen everyday I
wish I had control of
my life and my soul

You say to me I cannot live without you by my side
Then you left me here all alone to deal with all this pain
Take my hand now walk with me through all this cause I'll go insane
I feel empty without you here I cannot find my way my way my way

I had to say goodbye to you
I will not forget this
You will never know that
you're in my mind
I don't know how something like this could just happen to you
When will I see why you've been taken so far away from me
Now I sit here hoping to hear you or see you again
Let me go now I close my eyes Now I'm coming to see you

Never wake

Life is like a mystery I take it day by day
Left alone here in this world to Suffer constantly
I don't know what I am doing it seems I've lost my way
Wake me from this lasting dream and take my breath away

Never wake

I can't take this I lie awake every night in my bed
I can't sit here thinking about you again and again
I sort through the memories and
try to find ones that
make me who I am now
Wake me from my stay here
Take me from my place here
Wake me
Wake me
Wake me
Wake me
