HURT ME

all the pieces of the puzzle seem to fall into place
but the only thought that i could think was pissin in that fuckin face
the taste that you left in my mouth was rotten
and you think that all the shit you did to me could be forgotten

well fuck no
you both got me last time
next time i see your punk ass its mine
from behind dawg i'm gonna crack that skull
then i'm gonna laugh when you fall cause you fucked me raw

comin home late at night when your sneakin in the door
with a bottle half empty and your tank is on full 
you hurt me
and i will never forget
how you hurt me
and all the pain you caused
left my mind blank and my soul was lost
and now the thoughts are in my head and drifting side to side
you know i'm gonna get cause there is nowhere to hide
headlines will read on the night she died

trust me
i will get your ass back
if it kills me
for the rest of your life you will feel me
i'm gonna make you remember that you
hurt me
you fuckin hurt me
hurt me; hurt me; hurt me; hurt me
my head was fucked up; hurt me
when i was locked up: hurt me
made a phone call; hurt me
bitch put a block up; hurt me
on the phone letters to your home
but you never wrote me back
what the fucks up with that
one of these days i'm gonna get you bitch
find your body
in an valley
in the alley
in a ditch
with a 45 chrome to the back of your dome
havin everybody wonderin what the fuck is goin on
where the fuck did you go
never be back again
but i still keep thinkin about you now and then

trust me
i will get your ass back
if it kills me
for the rest of your life you will feel me
gonna make you remember that you
hurt me
you fuckin hurt me

i remember when i first said i love you
got confused from the first time i fucked you
you got nervous when i opened up your legs relax
cause i was raised on x-rated moves and porno mags

all day walk around with a full buzz
never fully understood what our love was
l-25 straight brought the light
same time had to dip outa town for a few nights

came back and my road dawgs waitin
tellin me some shit leavin me contemplaitin

murder

fuckin my best friend

unheard of

and i'm gonna get you in the end yeah
one of these days it'll be my time
and i'm gonna slit your throat make it look suicide
fuck you don't trust you
