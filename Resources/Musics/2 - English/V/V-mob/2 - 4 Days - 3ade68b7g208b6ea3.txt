4 DAYS

Why does the world have to work this way
Take it all away
I can remember the first time I saw you

You were a new face in my life why
Why'd you have to go

I can not see you but still I can feel you
Yes I can hear you but can you hear me too

You reach for me I reach for you
When will we meet up again

Try not to cry when I ask him why
When will I finally see the end

Partially broken I walk through my life
Without a care and I wish you were there

You'll live forever in my mind
Never let you go

I can not see you but still I can feel you
Yes I can hear you but can you hear me too

You reach for me I reach for you
When will we meet up again

Try not to cry when I ask him why
When will I finally see the end

I feel my life slipping away from me
Come take away the pain

You could not know how much I miss you so
I need you here with me

I'd give my hands to see you again
I'd give my life to hear your voice

I wish I could touch you
I wish I could see you
I wish you could hear me
I wish that I knew you
Everyday I look around and see the same thing
Never know how I'm gonna make it through another day

While I'm here fell Like the walls are slowly closing in
Every time I think that I will never see you again

Don't know what has happened
I know there's no reason
For you to be taken
From this world

You reach for me I reach for you
When will we meet up again

Try not to cry when I ask him why
Will will I finally see the end

I feel my life slipping away from me
Take away the pain

You could not know how much I miss you so
I need you here with me

I can't break free of my misery
Come take away the pain

It's you I need whenever I'm alone
I need you here with me

I need you here
Can you hear me?
Why can't you say that you'll help me break free
If you were able I know that you would
I think its wrong just the thought that you can't tell me why
