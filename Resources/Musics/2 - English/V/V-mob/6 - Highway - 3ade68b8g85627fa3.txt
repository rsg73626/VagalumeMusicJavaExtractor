HIGHWAY

Grip my throttle like a whiskey bottle
and I'm fallin thin better watch my soul get swallowed
How can everybody win my battle when my head keeps shakin
like a snake that raddles
Fight the demons
my soul is screamin
I Know the right way
But don't know the meanin

Don't question
My will power
Keep slippin
like a coward

Open up I'm in the situation
charge me guilty to the accusation
It's the only way I can relieve my pain
reality will make you go insane
my mind is sayin
to ignore the pressure
but I'd give my whole life for an ounce of pleasure

Don't question
My will power
Keep slippin
Like a coward

cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, Im trippin my mind, trippin my mind
cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, Im trippin my mind, trippin my mind
cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, Im trippin my mind, trippin my mind
cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, Im trippin my mind, trippin my mind

why; why; can't; can't; you; you understand; stand
why I can't be a man
my way
highway
I wanna fly way
if I'm gonna die I'm gonna die my way
