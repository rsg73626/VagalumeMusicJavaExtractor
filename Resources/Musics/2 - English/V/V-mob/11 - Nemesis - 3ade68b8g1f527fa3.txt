NEMESIS

I'll give you anything
I'll give you everything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you everything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you everything

NO!!!!!!

I'll face my fear for you
Crossing my hands, its nothing in me
Turn my ears deaf to suspicion
Always be the same

DENIED! MYSELF!
when your above everything else
STAND BY! AND KILL!
To the deepest state of the pain Ive felt
(lets go)

Dont let me hide!
anything, everything!
I show you my feelings mean nothing
I was hoping you would do the same
that Id do for you, but you just take away

ITS SHOWN
ITS SHOWN
ITS SHOWN

I'll give you anything, ill give you everything

I put my heart inside your hands
I sit back and watch the sand
Falling thru the hour glass
I watch the days pass

DENIED! MYSELF!
You care about everyone else
STAND BY! AND KILL!
To The deepest state to the pain Ive felt

I KNOW!!
That you may not help me see my way
I KNOW!!
That I cannot help but make a change
I KNOW!!
That I feel alone
And that you wont make it stop
I KNOW!
I KNOW!

NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOO!!!!!!

You make me feel so small when you ignore me
Take a breath that goes before me
you play the game at my expense
When you play ?? but i want some mense?
Denied! My eyes! ?? feel, im natious
Inside, I die
why!?!?!!?

have mercy...have mercy

ill give you anything
im under everything
i dont mean anything
im under everything
i dont mean anything
im under everything
i dont mean anything
im under everything
i dont mean anything
im under everything
i dont mean anything
im under everything

Dont let me hide!
anything, everything!
I show you my feelings but they mean nothing
I was hoping you would do the same
that Id do for you, but you just take away

ITS SHOWN
ITS SHOWN
ITS SHOWN

I'll give you anything, ill give you everything

I KNOW!!
That you wont help me see my way
I KNOW!!
That I cannot help but make a change
I KNOW!!
That I feel alone
