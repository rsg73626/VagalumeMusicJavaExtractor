IN & OUT

in and out of my life your animosity don't change
your attitude is strange but your paranoid the same because you
maintain your status with a fake apparatus
think you got us where you want us but its not enough to grab us
like rabbits in a cage thats wrapped up in a maze
dedicated for the day but tomorrow its a phase

take my suggestion let it go with confession
teach you a lesson by keeping you guessin
ill-faded task take off your mask
take it off too fast and land on your ass

i hide my pride

inside myself insane fucked up form mind games
controlled hate in me held back by serenity
farewell to the problem quest filled up with emptiness
disgusted with apathy from lost divinity
not giving up my energy deep down inside of me
i'll stand with the enemy and show them insanity

take my suggestion let it go with confession
teach you a lesson by keeping you guessin
ill-faded task take off your mask
take it of too fast and land on your ass

i hide my pride

everytime i see you commin at me never feeling right
you will never know just how i feel thats how i feel alright
fuck you motherfuckers you will never know how i fell
in your brightest hour you will never be this fuckin real
