REFLECTION

I can't believe it was a lie when you said it to me
Played it to me from the heart when you read it to me
Fed it to me with a silver spoon I believed
You let me to it as it turns out you been deceived
Your fucking lifestyle's got myself a nervous wreck
Having dreams with my hands around your fucking neck
Thrust
Grip it tight
Make it bust
I'm losing my head like you lost my fucking trust
Open up I can see inside your eyes what's to come ahead
By the way you feel I can see that you are staring dead
All emotion lost from shit that you have put me through
I will get you back and you will never have a fucking clue
Wilderness of mirrors and myself will can't stop running riot
Every time I think about the shit you did I wanna kill
Everything alive that's in your life I wanna keep it quiet
Just to let you know you let me fall that's how I fucking feel
I feel abused I feel so ashamed
Feel the pain from the burn from the lesson learned from the burning flame
I feel the pain and I'm so confused
Every time you tell a lie you're killing my trust leaving faith to die
You never thought I'd dig it up under estimate me
You got it all figured out always affiliate me
I can never get away cause you investigate me
I can never say a word cause you evaluate me
Believe yourself when you lie cause you do it so much
Got me fucked up thinking bout who I can trust
Everybody coming at me saying what I should do
Don't know why I feel this way but I wanna kill you
Open up I can see inside your eyes what's to come ahead
By the way you feel I can see that you are staring dead
All emotion lost from shit that you have put me through
I will get you back and you will never have a fucking clue
Wilderness of mirrors and myself will can't stop running riot
Every time I think about the shit you did I wanna kill
Everything alive that's in your life I wanna keep it quiet
Just to let you know you let me fall that's how I fucking feel
I feel abused I feel so ashamed
Feel the pain from the burn from the lesson learned from the burning flame
I feel the pain and I'm so confused
Every time you tell a lie you're killing my trust leaving faith to die
I feel abused I feel so ashamed
Feel the pain from the burn from the lesson learned from the burning flame
I feel the pain and I'm so confused
Every time you tell a lie you're killing my trust leaving faith to die
DIE
Fucked up inside
I see you inside
It's not good (x 8)
Why don't you see what you do?
Why should I wait here for you?
What do you see in yourself?
How can you live with yourself?
How could you think I could trust?
Always leave me in distrust
Thinking the same way you do
Put beside the things I knew
I try
Goodbye
I try
Goodbye
I feel abused I feel so ashamed
Feel the pain from the burn from the lesson learned from the burning flame
I feel the pain and I'm so confused
Every time you tell a lie you're killing my trust leaving faith to die
I feel abused I feel so ashamed
Feel the pain from the burn from the lesson learned from the burning flame
I feel the pain and I'm so confused
Every time you tell a lie you're killing my trust leaving faith to die
Die
Die
Die (Die)
