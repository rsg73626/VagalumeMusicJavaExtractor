FEEL NO SHAME

Is anyone alive out there?
Can anyone hear me?
No...

As I wonder why the thoughts start to fill my mind
Giving into you feeling used and abused
Pleasure replaces pain, I've gone and done it again
It's something that I can't control
Nobody to blame, but I feel no shame
Staring into your eyes feeding you more lies
One day I'll get whats mine, but until then
I feel no shame

I (Go, go, go)
I (Go, go, go)
I (Go, go, go)
I (Go, go, go)

Acting on instinct, what the fuck did you think?
Look into the sky I'm staring wondering why?
You can call me heartless but I can't control
I gave into temptation a long time ago
A feeling of pain close your eyes I promise you wont feel thing
Because to me its just a game
Remember one thing
I feel no shame

I (I)
Feel no
Shame (Shame)
Just go
I (I)
Feel no
Shame (Shame)
Just go
I (I)
Feel no
Shame (Shame)
Just go
I (I)
Feel no
Shame (Shame)
Just go away

Lie
Why won't you look at me? (Won't you look at me?)
Why won't you look at me? (Won't you look at me?)
Why won't you look at me? (Won't you look at me?)
Why won't you look at me? (Won't you look at me?)
Giving into you (Giving into you)
Giving into you (Giving into you)
Giving into you (Giving into you)
Giving into (You giving in)
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
I'm giving in
