LET IT GO!!!

(Daze) Or gripping my
(Face) I cant breath in the
(Waste) Open my eyes because my mind just wont stop, my
(Eyes) I'll open till
(Dry) My knuckles turn
(White)
I wont let go

Its enough, for me to feel it has got to me
Sometimes Im my own worse enemy

The (Pain)
That my mind (Creates)
Is feeding the (Waste)

Im the only one, who can fix this
Who can take the blame, cuz I did this
Im the only one, who can take the blame
Who can turn this around!

TAKE IT AWAY!
(I dont need this shit)
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SAID, THAT IVE DONE TO THIS DAY IS ????
TAKE IT AWAY
(I dont want it)
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SAID, THAT IVE DONE TO THIS DAY WILL BE MY LAST!

(Away) In my mind I can
(Change) ???? playing my mind
My life (has never felt)
Right (I cant feel)
Tonight
I cant let go

Its too much for me to feel it has got to me
This time it wont let go of me

(Sane) It will be
(okay) There must be a
(way)
to stop..

Please, God, let me sleep tonight
Let me feel numb to the voices that have begged me away my life
Let me drown them out, with the silence thats so fucking loud!

(Please, God, please, God
Please, God, please, God)

I WILL TAKE THE BLAME
(Take the blame!)
You can make me feel all right
