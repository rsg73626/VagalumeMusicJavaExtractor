BENEVOLENCE

I see the way you look at me
I'm so confused that I can not see
Don't know how to fear and I can't get away
If I don't get out of this I think ill go INSANE

Open up my eyes and I see you standing in the light
With the same look there the same when I shut them tight
So scarred that I can't think of what to say
Everytime you look around I think about the getaway
Running through my head
Everything I've said now I better get away from you!
Don't know what the fuck I'm gunna do
Every thing I feel right now is because of you

I look up at you as you stare down
Lost at words so I dont make a sound
Now my life flashes before my eyes
No one hears my words or silent cries

Open up my eyes and I see you standing in the light
With the same look there the same when I shut them tight
So scarred that I can't think of what to say
Everytime you look around I think about the getaway
Running through my head everything Ive said 
Now I better get away from you!
Don't know what the fuck I'm gunna do
Every thing I feel right now is because of you

I have so much that I have to hide
You don't see what I feel inside 
My whole life has been turned around
Late at night I hear familiar SOUNDS

If I'm gunna die will you tell me now?
When will I know? Tell me HOW
Will i know why? Tell me WHY
Should I let go? Should I say good BYE?
Should I get up? Should I run AWAY?
Should I take a chance to live another DAY?
Don't know what to do think I'll stay right HERE
Hold on tight with death so NEAR

Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE
Looking at us I see in your mind its all in my head
I CANT SEE

I can't see
I can't see
I can't feal
I can't see
I CAN'T FEAL
I CAN'T SEE
I CAN'T FEAL
I CAN'T SEE
I CAN'T FEAL
