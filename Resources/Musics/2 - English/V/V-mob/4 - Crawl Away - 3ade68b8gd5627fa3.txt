CRAWL AWAY

I'm sick, I create this
Don't want to feel inside
Never try, that I failed you
I looked to the sky to hide
Don't want the fuel is burning
That makes me clawed in mind
(Im gonna tear this down!)
And I'll crawl..away!

(I cry) to make you see
(I cry) you cannot stay away from me
I'll cry! I'll cry!

Im awake, and you cant deny this
Cant do this anymore, your leaving me in limbo
To prove to you that I..
Wont cry! Wont lie! Wont whine! I wont cry!

I lick your wounds, to heal the scars we made
Latern a cumal? night, enourmous wait

(DOWN) I wait
(DOWN) I wait
(DOWN) I wait
DOWN!

Trying to heal on my own
Try to live alone
Just to feel alone
Trashed all alone
After all it came, now its so far away
Never touched in the pain
Never one, never say

DONT GO AWAY
DONT GO AWAY

I lick your wounds, to heal the scars we made

(DOWN) I wait
(DOWN) I wait
(DOWN) I wait
DOWN!

(I cry) to make you see
(I cry) you cannot stay away from me
I'll cry! I'll cry!

(cut it all away, cut it all away, cut it all away, cut it all away)

I'll cry!
I'll cry!

Trying to heal on my own
Try to live alone
Just to feel alone
Trashed all alone

DONT GO AWAY
DONT GO AWAY

DONT...GO....AWAY!
