OUTRAGE

Its about time that we go into mother fuckin', RAMPAGE!
I'm in an, OUTRAGE!
An everybodies looking at me like i'm locked up in a, CAGE!
Get up out my, FACE!
You don't know my, PLACE!
Shit hits the fan and you blame it on my, RACE!
But you don't know whats true,
and your acting like you knew,
When your peeping out your window,
Like you know what i do.
Faggot.
