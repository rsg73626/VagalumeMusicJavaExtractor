TRANSPARENT

I see right through you
I see right through you
I see right through you
I see right through you
I am my own worst enemy
Look at me and tell me what you see
Can you see inside of me
All that’s left of me is a memory
It fucks with my mind I can't even hear what you say
Inside my head is far from here anyway
I look around and all I see is how to be
It's not for me so now I'm here to let you see
Away away I always run away
I should listen to what you have to say
To you to me I never will make you see
There's something locked away down inside of me
It fucks with my mind I can't even hear what you say
Inside my head is far from here anyway
I look around and all I see is how to be
It's not for me so now I'm here to let you see
Die (too)
Now take my life
I can not feel
The pain you bring
My way I'm torn
I can’t see when you look at me never know what to say
I can’t see look inside me
I see right through you
Right through you
I see right through you
Right through
I see right through you
Right through you
I see right through you
Never can I decide a way to see
You know that I would never want to be
The way that I appear is agony
I am losing myself to misery
I see right through you
Right through you
I see right through you
Right through
I see right through you
Right through you
I see right
Interrupt my destiny I can't turn around watch you break free
I reach deep inside of me it's a fucking mental thing
Can't overcome the way I feel
It's grown into a part of me
Never see what others see I think its called insanity
I know you can't fucking silence me
So let go of the way you label me
I don't know how it feels to be like me
I don't show everything you need to see
I grow all the pain inside of me
So just go
I can’t see when you look at me never know what to say
I can’t see look inside me
I see right through you
Right through you
I see right through you
Right through
I see right through you
Right through you
I see right through you
Never can I decide a way to see
You know that I would never want to be
The way that I appear is agony
I am losing myself to misery
I see right through you
