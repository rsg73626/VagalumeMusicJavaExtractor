MY ASYLUM

it's my head
follow me to the center of my brain
i will not be here so will you explain
you can't say that you were
a friend to me now you're gone
out of my life i still
feel you inside the walls of my brain
i think i am insane
you can't see me now that i'm so fucking empty
you don't do a thing you just make me unhappy
you look at me as a way out of the pain

thinking about the way things have turned out
i just don't know what this is all about

take away
what i say
it equals nothing in my memory
everyday i am constantly feeling empty
with no words to say

you can take me as i come to you
or you can leave me here without a clue
pay attention to the words i say
you will learn my voice everyday

suffer with me help me be me
i can't hear you
take me with you when you leave here
take me with you
i can't take this take me away
i go insane
do hyou hear me can you see me
looking for you

i can't feel me
