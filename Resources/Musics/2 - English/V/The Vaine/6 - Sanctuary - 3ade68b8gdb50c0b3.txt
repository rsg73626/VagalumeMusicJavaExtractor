SANCTUARY

Oh
The innocence of violence from your hands
Brings out the best of what you don't have to offer
A bleeding heart left on the floor
The result of a monster
A brutal attack
Strategy has control
Your victim is lifeless
Left clinging to their last moment

Stay away from me
I need my sanctuary
I need my sanctuary
I can't have it when you're around
Stay away from me
I need my sanctuary
I need my sanctuary
I can't have it when you're around

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohh

I planned it all out
A simple scene of letters
Spelling out what I was trying to say

Stay away from me
I need my sanctuary
I need my sanctuary
I can't have it when you're around
Stay away from me
I need my sanctuary
I need my sanctuary
I can't have it when you're around

I'd do anything
I'd do everything
I'd do anything for you
(For you)

Stay away from me
I need my sanctuary
I need my sanctuary
I can't have it when you're around
Stay away from me
I need my sanctuary
I need my sanctuary
I can't have it when you're around
