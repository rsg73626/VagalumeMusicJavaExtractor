BEEN STALKING JACK

Do you, for Free? I never saw that one coming. 
Do you, for Free? I always thought you would. 
They don't mean anything unless they're gorgeous, 
High price; this is the premier league bitch, premier league bitch. 

[CHORUS]
This is the way I like it oh baby faster, faster. 
In the middle of the night when the time is right just touch me.
Feel my fingertips brush across your lips. 
This is the way I like it oh baby harder, harder.
So here we are hear us breathe. 

Down strumpet? Oh no no no. 
Who's a pretty boy? Who's a pretty boy? 
Not faster wit, just a better time. 
Take a number babe, and then get in line.
I'll get to you when I'm done with this one. 

[CHORUS]

Come here. Come and feel me.
Boy just feel me.
Then release. 
Try me. Boy just push me. 
Don't just be here. Serve your purpose.

The more in a night the higher I score. 
It's all a game, it's all a game. 
Youâ€™re not alone, bring on another one, you're just another one

[CHORUS]
