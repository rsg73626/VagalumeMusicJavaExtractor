IF NO NEWS, START RUMOURS

Hey hey, you
This was not an accident
She fell into the darkest graves she dug herself
You think that she is not to blame
But if, if you only knew that she
That she stand alone in time.

Watching this, it’s so pathetic
If I could find a way out, I’d turn it down.
This will be, this will be a meaningful demise
Of lies and darkened undertones
I’m moving, going nowhere though

Don’t blame yourself

Hey hey, you
This was not an accident
She fell into the darkest graves she dug herself
You think that she is not to blame
But if, if you only knew that she
That she stand alone in time.

Crying for, crying’s sake
Leaving her, no
Saving her, no
She faces towards her death
Her mind in battle mode

Finding nothing through searching
Closer, her lungs still breathe
Through fear she speaks
Claustrophobia
Claustrophobia
She’s screaming silence now
Deafening.

Hey hey, you
This was not an accident
She fell into the darkest graves she dug herself
You think that she is not to blame
But if, if you only knew that she
That she stand alone in time.

Not surrounded, but suffocating
She braces herself
For what is to become
Claustrophobia
Consuming guilt, killing her

Changes don’t mean a thing
If she makes them now
If this goes to plan
They won’t find out
Nobody gets hurt if no one knows
No one knows.

Hey hey, you
This was not an accident
She fell into the darkest graves she dug herself
You think that she is not to blame
But if, if you only knew that she
That she stand alone in time.
