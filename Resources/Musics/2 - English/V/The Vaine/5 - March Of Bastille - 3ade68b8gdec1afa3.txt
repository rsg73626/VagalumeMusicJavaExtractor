MARCH OF BASTILLE

how did we become strangers from afar?
i don't, i don't know.
but you pushed and you shoved me
to think that you loved me,
it doesn't show.
oh no. it doesn't show.



and here the skies will change
to a brighter shade of grey,
but we'll fall so far we'll drown.
and closer comes the day,
that we will fade away
no reason and goodbye.


quiet for a while
until i've caught my breath
well it's coming now,
i've cried for so long now.
and i'll try to breathe
but this air is choking me, my hope is gone.
and i'll try to breathe
but this air is choking me, my hope is gone.


and here the skies will change
to a brighter shade of grey,
when we'll fall so far we'll drown.
and closer comes the day
that we will fade away,
but no reason and goodbye.



closer comes the day we fade away.
closer comes the day we fade away.
(X2)


(Closer! Closer!)
closer comes the day we fade away.
(we fade away!)
(Closer! Closer!)
closer comes the day we fade away.
(we fade away!)
(X2)


here the skies will change
to a brighter shade of grey,
we'll fall so far we'll drown.
