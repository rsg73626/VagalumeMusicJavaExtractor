DAMAGE IN THE WAITING ROOM

Where's the heart that you put in 
when we started this thing?
We?ve begun, and you don?t understand 
that you?re missing.
Where have you gone, where have you gone?
I hate what you?ve become, 
I hate what you?ve become.
You?re loving yourself and leaving us behind.

From where I'm standing 
you look like someone I could hate.
Lies that need no introduction yet 
you'll announce your name.
I gave my all, two can play this game.
You're doing this alone.
Does this face look like it cares?
Where's the heart now?
Where?s the heart?

Where's the heart that you put in 
when we started this thing?
We?ve begun, and you don?t understand 
that you?re missing.
Where have you gone, where have you gone?

I hate what you?ve become, 
I hate what you?ve become.
You?re loving yourself and leaving us behind.

I know this is where you wish you were.
Are you laughing now?
Cause I'm laughing now.
Where have you gone?
I'll make a mental note to think about the catch up
game.
But you're not worth it; I'm so tired of you.
You are me but we're different, you are me but we're
different.

Where's the heart that you put in 
when we started this
thing?
We?ve begun, and you don?t understand 
that you?re
missing.
Where have you gone, where have you gone?
I hate what you?ve become, 
I hate what you?ve become.
You?re loving yourself and leaving us behind.
