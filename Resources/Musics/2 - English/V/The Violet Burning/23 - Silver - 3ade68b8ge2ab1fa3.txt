SILVER

I realize something is missing
I climb to the top of it all
I keep crashing down, crashing down
You say to me,
"Don't cry, I now you'll make it."
I'm in love with you

We were the lovers with silver wings
Flying too high
Melting in the rays of the sun
You say to me
"Don't cry, I know you'll make it."
I'm in love with you,
Starlight
I'm in love with you

We were the lovers in silver,
We were the lovers in silver
Do you think you'll ever come down?
Starlight
Do you think you'll ever come down?
And find me now
Reach me now
Who's gonna find me now?
I got lost
Somehow
"Don't cry, don't cry."

We were the lovers in silver
We were the lovers with silver wings
Wings to fly
Wings that don't fly, anymore
