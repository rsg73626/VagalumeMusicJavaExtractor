THROUGH MY TEARS

At night I hear the sound
Of two hearts breaking
In the light I see the scars left behind

Through my tears I know
One thing remains
You, always you

I've held the hand of fear
In the night I was shaking
I drank the cup of sorrow
The taste so sweet on my lips

I am nothing
I am nothing
Unless you make me more

If I descend into the depths of hell
You will find me
And if I climb above the stars
You are there

Through my tears I know
One thing remains
You, always you

I am weak
I am nothing
I am tired
I am torn in two

I've seen the lonely people
Crying out in the night
Screaming out for shelter
From the storms of this life

There is just one thing
That remains
You, always you

If I descend into the depths of hell
You will find me
And if I climb above the stars
You are there

Through my tears I know
One thing remains
You, always you
