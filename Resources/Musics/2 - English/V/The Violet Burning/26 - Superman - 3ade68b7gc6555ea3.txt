SUPERMAN

Out the door, just in time,
Head down the 405,
Gotta meet the new boss by 8am.

The phone rings in the car,
The wife is working hard,
She’s running late tonight, again.

Well, I know what I’ve been told
Uve gotta work to feed the soul
But I cant do this all on my own
No I know, I’m no superman.

I’m no superman

You’ve got your love on line,
You think your doing fine,
But you’re just plugged into the wall,
And that deck of tarot cards
Won’t get you very far
There ain’t no hand to break your fall. 

Well, I know what I’ve been told 
You’ve gotta know just when to fold
But I can’t do this all on my own
No I know, I’m no superman

I’m no superman

That’s right

You’ve crossed the finish line,
Won the race, but lost your mind
Was it worth it after all?

I need you here with me,
Cause love is all we need, yeah
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall

We’ll I know what I’ve been told,
You got to break free to break the mould,
We’ll I can’t do this all on my own,
No, I can’t do this all on my own,
I know that I’m no 
Superman 

I’m no superman

I’m no superman

Someday we’ll be together
I’m no superman
Someday 

Someday we’ll be together
Someday 
I’m no superman
