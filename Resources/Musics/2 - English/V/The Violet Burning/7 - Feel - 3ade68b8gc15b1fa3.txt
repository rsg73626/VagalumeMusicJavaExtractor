FEEL

Here, waiting for the sun
Will she ever shine on us again?
Oh, inside I feel so cold
Feel what's inside of me

One last breath before we go
One last kiss upon my soul
Oh, I guess it's time to rise
Feel what's inside of me
I cannot take these lies
Heal what's inside of me

Even now, I feel like I could crumble
Here and now I feel like I could crumble

Don't let me die here, naked
Don't let me die here,
Knowing these lies
Come a little bit closer now
Put your hands on my shoulders
A little bit closer now
Feel the tears run down my swollen cheeks
Feel, feel

Can I see the light?
Can I see the light?
I can't see the light
Can I see the light?
