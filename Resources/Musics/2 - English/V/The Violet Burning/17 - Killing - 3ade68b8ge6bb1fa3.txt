KILLING

Can you feel the pain he feels
As the nails go through his hands?
Driving them in deeper
Bloody red hands
A crown of thorns on his head
"Come down from there!" they cried.
"You saved others, can't you save yourself?"

Blindfolded, the soldiers demand prophecy
"Who is hitting you now?"
"Who is hitting you now?"
"Why don't you tell us? I thought you were the Son of God"
"Who is hitting you now?"
"Take him away!"

Oh they're killing my Lord
Oh oh they're killing my Lord
Like a lamb in the slaughter is sheared
So he never spoke a word
Oh oh they're killing my Lord

By the power of God
Day became as dark as night
The curtain torn in two
"It is finished!"
They spit on him and mock his name
Very much like the world today
Beat him, laugh at him
"Ha ha ha ha"

Oh they're killing my Lord
Oh oh they're killing my Lord
Like a lamb in the slaughter is sheared
So he never spoke a word
Oh oh they're killing my Lord

Can you feel the pain he feels
As the nails go through his hands?
Cause they're driving them in deeper
Deeper deeper deeper
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
