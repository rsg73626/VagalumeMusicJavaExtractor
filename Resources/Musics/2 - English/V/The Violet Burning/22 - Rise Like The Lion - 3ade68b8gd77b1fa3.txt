RISE LIKE THE LION

Your eyes, they shine like diamonds
Deep in my black soul
In the night I hear you calling
Calling me back home

You say, "Run, I will hold you"
You say, "Run to me, I will kiss you"
You say, "Run to me, I'll come running"

I will rise
Like the lion
From the slumber

You are the jewel
I am the clay
You make me shine
Bright like the day
When the world overwhelms me
I hear your voice
Clear as the day

You say, "Run, I will hold you"
You say, "Run to me, I will kiss you"
You say, "Run to me, I'll come running"

I will rise
Like the lion
From the slumber

I will rise
Like the lion
From the slumber
