SUN AND THE SKY

If I was a river, deep
I would surely run
From shore to your shore
Maybe I could sweep you off your feet
Maybe I could show you some things
That we both could ignore

Do it, do it again
Say you'll be near me
Like the sun and the sky

If I could be superman
I would only wind up dead in the end
But maybe we could fly away
To the sea with each other
Maybe our worlds would collide

I see you away in the distance
Your brightness is turning me blue
Turning me blue

So, you be the sun
I'll be the sky
Hang on to me
Just give me your light
