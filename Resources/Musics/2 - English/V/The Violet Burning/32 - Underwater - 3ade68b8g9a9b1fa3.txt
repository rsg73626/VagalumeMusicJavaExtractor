UNDERWATER

Can I hold you under with me?
Lately, it's a little bit hard
So breathe in deep
Let's float here for a while

Is it healing me or drowning me?
The more I live, the less I know
When we walked on water
We were perfect
Decided to go

Have I gone too far?
Lately, it's more than just a little bit hard
Cause I'm caught underwater breathing
Breathing is hard
Have I gone too far?
It's all I know
More than just a little bit hard
Caught in the undertow, reaching
It's pulling me down
Have I gone too far?
Can you reach me?
I've gone too far

Just a little bit helpless
Just a little bit helpless
