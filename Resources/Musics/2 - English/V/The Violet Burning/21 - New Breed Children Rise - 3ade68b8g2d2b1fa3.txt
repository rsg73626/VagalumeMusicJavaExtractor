NEW BREED CHILDREN RISE

I see the new day rise
The darkest world, the brightest skies
Let your new breed come forth
Let your spirit fall upon our lives

We are the fire
We are the souls
We are the children
We are yours

Let the new day arise
Let my daddy's heart of love
Reach right down and put
The sparkle in your eyes
The world will fall apart
But he will always stay beside you
Don't you know

We are the fire
We are the souls
We are the children
We are yours

We are the light
