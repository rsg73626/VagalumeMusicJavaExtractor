FORTY WEIGHT

Oh God be merciful to me
Lift me from the earth and cover me
I wait for you.

Lord, my cup is empty
Won't You come now and fill me up

Oh, my Lord
I love Your ways
I lift my heart
I sing Your praise

I wait for You
I wait for You

Lord, my cup is empty
Won't You come now and fill me up

Your love is forever
And Your mercy is forever
Your love is higher than the heavens
I reach up, I reach up

I wait for You to hear me
Won't You come just a little bit closer
Your love is deeper than the oceans
I go down, I still breathe
And wait for You to fill me up
Fill me up
Won't You come now and fill me up.

Come just a little bit closer
I will wait for You
