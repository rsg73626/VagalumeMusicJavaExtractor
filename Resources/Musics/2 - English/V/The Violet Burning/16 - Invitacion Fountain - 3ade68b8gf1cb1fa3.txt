INVITACION FOUNTAIN

Let all who are weak 
All who are weary 
Come to the Rock 
Come to the Fountain 
All who have sailed 
On the rivers of heartache 
Come to the see 
Come on, be set free! 

If You lead me Lord, 
I will follow 
Where You lead me Lord, 
I will Go 
Come and heal me Lord, 
I will follow 
Where You lead me Lord, 
I will go 
I will go 

Let all who are weak 
All who are weary 
Come to the Rock 
Come to the Fountain 
Let all who have climbed, 
The mountains of heartbreak 
Reach to the sky 
Come on, and give your life 

If You lead me Lord, 
I will follow 
Where You lead me Lord, 
I will Go 
Come and heal me Lord, 
I will follow 
Where You lead me Lord, 
I will go 
I will go 

Heal me. 
Heal me. 
All who are weak 
All who are weary 
All who are tired 
All who are thirsty 
All who have failed 
All who are broken 
Come to the Rock 
Come to the Fountain
