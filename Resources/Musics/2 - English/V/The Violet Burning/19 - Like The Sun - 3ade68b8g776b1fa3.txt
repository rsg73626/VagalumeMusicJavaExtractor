LIKE THE SUN

My love
Be near me tonight
Hide me in the shadow of your wings

I will call on you
For you will answer me

You shine like the sun
In all its strength
You are my love
My everything

Pour yourself all over me
Let it flow
Flow like rivers, flow like rivers

Open wide
The blue skies
Let it flow
Flow like rivers, flow like rivers

I will call on you
For you will rescue me

You shine like the sun
In all its strength
You are my love
My everything

You shine
