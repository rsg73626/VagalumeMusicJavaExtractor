GOLDMINE

Take me
To the other side
And show me
All those things inside
By the light of the moon
Hold my shaking hand
But close to me
I do not understand
Being like angels
Lined up in my head
And wanting to sit inside your heart
Wanting to sit inside your heart

Goldmine
I see that you are bright
Just don't say
That it's not worth a fight
Will I ever shine
In your eyes?
Don't leave me
Oh, don't hide tonight
I don't really hate you
I hate what I do
I'm wanting to sit inside your heart
Wanting to sit inside your heart

Words that you say, I could never forget you
Don't turn away, please, just let me inside you
No matter what words that you say
I could never forget you

Under your skin I'll go
I will always love you
Into your eyes I'll go
I will always
If I could be where you are
Love me, you move me
Crush me, bend me, please don't break me
Goldmine, goldmine
If I could be where you are
If I could find what you hide
You leave me breathless
Breathless, behind your eyes
Don't hide your eyes
You leave me
Dazzled, breathless
Behind your eyes
Under your skin
