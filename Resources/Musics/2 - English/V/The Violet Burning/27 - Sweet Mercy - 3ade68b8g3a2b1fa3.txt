SWEET MERCY

Standing
In dark, dark lands
So close to me is hell
I could reach out, take her hand
And I'm bleeding
Cause the world she pierced my soul
And I'm dreaming
Of days with my first love

I want to go back again
Sweet, sweet mercy
Shine on me,
Sweet mercy

You, never turned away
You'd call out my name
Even though I would walk away

If I fall down
Will you help me?
If I fall down
Will you love me?

Crying, in the loneliness of the night
Dying, in the emptiness of this life

Sweet, sweet mercy
Shine on me.
Can you hear me?
Please, be near me
