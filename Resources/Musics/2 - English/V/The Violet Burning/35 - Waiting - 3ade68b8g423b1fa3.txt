WAITING

Take me to the sea
And let her waters cover me
Though my heart may sink
There beneath her skin I know I'm safe
From the lies they told to me

I wonder if you'll come to me
I wonder if I'll know your face
So beautiful and far away
If you look inside you'll see I'm not
I'm not what you would want

I heard you were a sailor
You sailed the seven seas
Gathered lots of treasure
But you never
You never uncovered me

I am only in this world
I am only in this world
Hoping that you'll discover me
I hope that you'll uncover me
And pour yourself like water over me
Pour yourself like water over me
In the sea of love I'm lying
Hidden hidden
