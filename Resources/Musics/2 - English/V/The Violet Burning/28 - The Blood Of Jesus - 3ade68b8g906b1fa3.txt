THE BLOOD OF JESUS

You gave Your body pierced through for me. 
You gave Your blood poured out for me. 
Father, You gave Your son, 
A sacrifice for me. 
I fall down to my knees, 
Lord have mercy on me. 
Heal me, cleanse me, 

With the blood of Jesus, 
Washes white as snow. 
On the cross my Jesus, 
You gave Your life. 
For me.
