GROOVE BABY - WHITE SOUL

Last thing I remember
I was crawling on the floor
My hands were shaky
My eyes grew dim
I was screaming out
For something more

I looked for such a long time
Looking for some peace of mind

Now I'm a groove baby
White like the snow
I've got a white heart,
A white soul
No baby, don't offer me jewels
Cause I'm getting off of this
Ship of fools

Well I looked around
For all my days
For something to satisfy
I tried everything
That I got my hands on
I looked for such a long time
Finally found peace for all time

Now I'm a groove baby
White like the snow
I've got a white heart,
A white soul
No baby, don't offer me jewels
Cause I'm getting off of this
Ship of fools
