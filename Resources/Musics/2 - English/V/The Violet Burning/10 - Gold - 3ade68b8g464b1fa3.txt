GOLD

Give me a heart
White like snow
Give me a heart
Pure as gold

Give me a heart
White like snow
Give me a heart
Pure as gold

You know I've been searching
High and so low
For a love so real
A love like gold
Make it
Make it gold

With the sun in your eyes
Take me to where you are
With the wind in your hands
Show me the way that you feel

Give me a heart
White like snow
Show me a heart
Pure as gold

I can't help this feeling I feel
My heart's spinning around
Turning, turning, turning

It hurts so bad
To know what I need
Take this love of gold
Put it inside

With the sun in your eyes
Take me to where you are
With the wind in your hands
Show me the way that you feel
Show me the way

Show me the way that you feel
Show me the way

Do you believe like I do?
Do you believe like I do?
Do you believe like I believe in you?

Give me a heart
White like snow
Give me a heart
Pure as gold

I climb into the heavens
I dive into the seas
Show me this place
Is it inside me?

With my heart all in pieces
Can you make it whole?
Shall I join the dance of fools
In the city of gold?

Do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you believe
Do you, do you believe in me?
Cause I don't
