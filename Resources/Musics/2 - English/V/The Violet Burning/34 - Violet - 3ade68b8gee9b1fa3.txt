VIOLET

If I was a dancer I'd dance with you
If I was a dreamer I'd dream about you
If I was a blind man and had no eyes
I know you'd be by my side

Violets are blue, and blood is red
It fell from your hands and the thorns on your head
I heard you cry out loud and the day went black
They thought the stone in the door could hold you back

Violet won't you take my hand
And hold me like forever I want you

I've seen the world as it's growing darker
Silently you stand beside her
In a quiet voice you say, "This is the way"
And in the blackest night she sees the day

Violet won't you take my hand
And hold me like forever I want you
Violet I know we can make it
