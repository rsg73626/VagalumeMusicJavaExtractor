THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE

Not the jewels
Of a thousand kings
Not the waves
Of the mighty sea
Not the powers that be
In the heavens or in hell
Could ever separate me
From your love

When you ask me to be near you
And you say, "Come, take my hand"
I say, "Be near me"
"Be near me"

There is nowhere else I'd rather stay
Than in your arms
There is nowhere else I want to be
But in your arms

Not the skies
Or the stars above
Not the treasure
Of a thousand loves
Not palaces of gold
Or castles by the sea
Could ever separate me
From your love
