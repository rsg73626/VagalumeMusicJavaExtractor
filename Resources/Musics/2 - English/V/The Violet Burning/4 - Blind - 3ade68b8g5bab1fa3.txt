BLIND

Got some time?
Have you got feelings?
Will you sell some, if I give you this stone?
I can't help it, I've nothing left to give.

See the light pour through me
Searching, but there's nothing at all
See the light when we both collide

And we fall
And I'm blind

What went wrong?
How come I stayed here?
Far away from the light in your eye
I couldn't help it, I couldn't find your love

I can see your light pour through me
Looking for the love in it all
I see the light when we both collide

And we fall
And I'm blind

It's down to me
But I couldn't barely figure it out
Why did I leave you
So far behind?

I came here
Looking for your love
Reaching for your love, in the dark
But you were fading
And I'm blind
Stone blind
And I can't reach you
