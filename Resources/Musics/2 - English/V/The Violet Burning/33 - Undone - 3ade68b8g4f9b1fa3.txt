UNDONE

I wanna know if it would be alright
To be with you tonight
I am undone

Wait, don't go
Don't let my heart turn to stone
Fear, it has no home
When you are near

Cause I need you now
More than then
I need you to let your rain
Down on me
Let it fall
All around me

Wait, don't hide
Please shelter me in your side
From there my strength is derived
I am done

So, is that the way the story goes?
In your arms, I know
It's alright

I can hear the sound
Of rain coming down
