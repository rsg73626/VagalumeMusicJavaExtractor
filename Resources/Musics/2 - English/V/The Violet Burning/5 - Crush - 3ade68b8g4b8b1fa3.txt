CRUSH

Should I let you near me?
Did you take what's mine?
Maybe I should show you
Why I'm lying here
And leave you all behind

I think I caught this feeling
Standing by the light of the world
Maybe I was dreaming
Like I told you before,
I wanted to love you

Maybe I never understood
Maybe I'm just not pure
You tell me how you love me
Was that a lie?
I'm not sure

Here am I
Here am I
Standing by the river
Moving by the places that haunt me
Pure am I

We are find where we want to go
We are trying to regain control
Let the streams of light pour down on me
Let the love that heals me set me free

Come on, crush me
Let it crush me
Crush me, you crush me baby
Crush me

I wanted to love you
I wanted to trust you
I just wanted to...

Bring it on now
Bring it on now
Fill my soul, it leaks
Fill my soul, it leaks

Could you save me now?
I didn't think I would fall so far down
When you crushed me

With a kiss you embrace me
With your lips you betray me
And you crush me, now
You crush me
