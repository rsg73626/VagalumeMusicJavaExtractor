THERE IS NO ONE LIKE

All I have
All I am
I lay it down before you
With my heart, I give
Anything for you
Everything, I lay it down for you

I am nothing
And I have nowhere to turn
I am nothing
So I lay down and cry for mercy
O mercy

Everything I am
I lay, I give
I cast my crowns
Down to the ground

I am nothing
And I have nowhere to turn
I am nothing
So I lay down

And there is
There is no one
There is no one like you
