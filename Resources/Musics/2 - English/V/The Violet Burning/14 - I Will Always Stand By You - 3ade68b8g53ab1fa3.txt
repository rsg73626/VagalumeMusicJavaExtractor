I WILL ALWAYS STAND BY YOU

Hey, do you feel afraid?
Do you feel so alone?
Have you gone so far from home?
Well I know
Cause I've been there too
It hurts so bad,
It breaks you in two

I will always stand by you
I will always love you
So cry out to me
And I will run to thee
When the night comes down on you

Hey, won't you let me be real?
Let me show you how I feel about you
You're precious to me
O can't you see?
You're the one,
You're the one I died for

I will always stand by you
I will always love you
So cry out to me
And I will run to thee
When the night comes down on you

When the world falls down around you
I will be there
Always for you
