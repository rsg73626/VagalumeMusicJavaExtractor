LAST ONES

Guess I never tell you
How I feel when I'm down
Though I know you're right beside me
Sometimes I feel so lost
But when I look into your eyes
I know that you're true
I long for the day when I'll always
Be with you
When I see

These tears I cry for the last time
They're the last ones I cry

Sometimes it seems like forever
But I know that it's soon
I can hear the voices
I can hear the voices
Of all those who laid their
Lives at your feet
They shall live forever
Because they believe
And I'll see

These tears I cry for the last time
They're the last ones I cry

I will never feel alone again
I will never feel afraid
I will never have to cry again
I can't wait for that day
When I see you take hold of the
Ocean of tears and cast it away forever
With the pain from the years
And I'll see

These tears I cry for the last time
They're the last ones I cry

These tears I cry for the last time
They're the last ones I cry
