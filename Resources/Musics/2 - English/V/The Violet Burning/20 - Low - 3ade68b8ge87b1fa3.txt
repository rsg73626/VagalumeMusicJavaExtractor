LOW

could die here tonight
Your beautiful words in my soul
I could die here tonight
And you wouldn't even notice
You wouldn't even protest

We could lie here together
Pulling the stars from the sky
Maybe things will get better
Maybe not, I don't know why

Do you feel scared like I do?
Do you feel lower than angels?
Do you feel scared like I do?
Do you feel love so high?

Bring the stars from the mountains
How far down can we go?
By the floors of the ocean
Are we falling like stones?
Am I your sinking star?

Do you feel scared like I do?
Do you feel lower than angels?
I am reaching high
Do you feel... oh... so high?

I feel your fire
I feel it
Breathe on me
Come on, breathe
Breathe on me, river that fills my soul

I could die here tonight
Your beautiful words in my soul
Maybe things will get better
Maybe I am the liar
Maybe I am the liar
Baby, I am the liar

But, I feel your fire
Near my soul
Near my heart
I feel it, breathe on me
Come on, breathe
Come on, breathe on me

Do you feel scared?
Do you feel lower?
Do you feel scared like I do?
It's your love that keeps me here
It's my heart that's caving in
You are gone and I am broken
Do you feel love so high?
Love, so high
I feel high
Near the ocean floor

Near the floors of the ocean
How far down can we go?
