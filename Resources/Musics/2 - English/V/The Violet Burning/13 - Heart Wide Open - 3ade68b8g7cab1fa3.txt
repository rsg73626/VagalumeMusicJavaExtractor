HEART WIDE OPEN

I watch the water down the drain
Touch my life, it feels like pain
In this moment here, I feel the silence

With my hands held high
With my heart wide open
With my hands held high
You're touching me

Sweetly, sweetly you sing to me
O so sweetly
Higher and higher will you lift me?

I've seen the kings
But I've felt the gentle touch
Of the One True King who sits above
All other ones

With my hands held high
With my heart all broken
With my hands held high
You're touching me

Sweetly, sweetly you sing to me
O so sweetly
Higher and higher will you lift me?

And I long for you to kiss me
I long for you to kiss me

And I long for you
I long for you to
Burn my soul, burn my heart
Burn my soul, tear me apart
O how I long for you to kiss me
