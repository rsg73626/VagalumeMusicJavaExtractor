IF YOU LET ME

I've been watching you
For a long time
I have loved you
From the beginning of time
I am the one who was
Betrayed with a kiss
See the blood run down
My fingertips

I gave it all for you
Shed my skin for you
I held you close
When no one else would
I paid the price
Cause no one else could
Was it the worldly love
Was it the devil's kiss
That took the smile from your ruby lips?

If you let me
Take your hand
I'll lead you from
This lonely land
I'll take you higher, higher
If you let me

I say believe in me
I will set you free
I'll hold you close
When no one else will
I paid the price
It's me that they killed
Was it the worldly love
Was it the devil's kiss
That took the smile from your ruby lips?
