FACE OF BEAUTY

Love, sweet love
Come rain on me
Come pour yourself
All over me

Love, sweet love
Come reign on me
Come pour yourself
All over me

I've seen the face of beauty
His head is crowned with thorns
His face is ripped and torn

I've seen the king in all his strength
His eyes are filled with tears
The God who knows my fears

The lamb who came to die
Over death did rise

Behold he is coming
With the clouds in the sky
Seen by every eye
Even those who pierced him

He will gather every tribe
There is no place to hide

Before him we will weep
Fall to your knees

Stay, don't turn away from me
(Let me hide)
Don't turn your face away from me
(In your arms)
Stay
(Love pour over me)
Here in the night I need you
(Let me hide)
Here in this life I seek you
(In your arms)
Stay
(Love pour over me)

The king in all his strength
His eyes filled with tears
The God who knows my fears

Love, sweet love
Come rain on me
Come pour yourself
All over me

Love, sweet love
Come reign on me
Come pour yourself
All over me

Let me hide
In your arms
Love pour over
Love, come cover me
