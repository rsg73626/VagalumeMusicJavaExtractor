INTO THE OPEN

cry, child / try to be bigger than me / you'll see just how fast it all comes around / you'll never be much / daddy holds my head while i sleep / sing me songs that his father once penned for him / you'll never be much / you'll never be anything / into the open air / into your smiling mug / into the open air to prove you're the top / out of the fierce parade / and into your smiling mug / into the open air to prove you're the top / some days you don't want to get out of bed / so you don't and everyone gets ahead in the world / you'll never be much /some days the only thought that consoles your tired head at the close of another dull days is / you'll never be much / you'll never be anything (some people spend their whole lives saying 'come out and play with me, come out and stay with me, come out and play' and then they run away / they'll never be much / and if you wait your whole life for somebody to say to you 'come out and play with me, come out and stay' and then you run away / you'll never be much / you'll never be anything)
