THE PRIZE FIGHTER

crossed off, but never forgotten / misplaced, but never losing hold / these are the moments that bind us / repressed, but never erased / knocked down, but never giving up / locked up where no one can find us / we'll survive in here til the end / there are no more fights to fight / my trophies are the scars that will never heal / but i get carried away sometimes / i wake up in the night swinging at the ceiling / it's hard to leave old ways behind/ but harder when you think that's all there is / don't look at me that way / ignored, when your whole world's collapsed / dismissed, before you speak a word / these are the moments that bind you / come clean, but everything's wrong / sustained, but barely holding on / run down, with no one to find you / we're survivors, here til the end
