FOUR STORY TANTRUM

she lives in a four story tantrum 
 for a long face 
 the house that her parents hand-crafted for her 
a trashcan, a toilet is all that she sees inside 
 outside a world that doesn't know her riddle 
 she doesn't need much besides the clothes on her floor 
and solace in someone with softer remarks 
 the courage to be by herself and be okay this time
she just doesn't want to remember at all 
 so don't tell me i'm wrong or right 
 consider yourself for once 
leave me alone to wrap myself up in my fantasies 
 snap me in half, burn me alive 
 i'll suffer it all for the consequences are nothing at all / just tell it starts all over now 
 life's too hard sometimes 
 you give it your all 
 and all that you get is tired 
 the more that you spend 
the more all your friends begin 
 to see you erased 
 chastised and chaste from them 
don't you fear, don't give up 
it's too late for now, but don't give up 
 it's too late, but don't you fear, don't give up 
she lives in a four story tantrum 
 for a long face 
and outside there's no one and nothing
