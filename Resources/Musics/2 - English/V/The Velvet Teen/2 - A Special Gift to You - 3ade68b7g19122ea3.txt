A SPECIAL GIFT TO YOU

two x's connected by a dotted line
a special gift to you
one representing where you are
and what is left to do
it's so easy to forget what you want
i pull the question from my skull
it's so easy to forget
refracted, distracted, replaced by bigger ones
a special gift to you
both representing where we were
and what we didn't do
it's so easy to forget what you want
i pull the question from my skull
it's so easy to forget
and i don't care to talk about the past
i cheated everyone
i beat the odds and beat the band
but i've forgotten what i've won 
i forget
