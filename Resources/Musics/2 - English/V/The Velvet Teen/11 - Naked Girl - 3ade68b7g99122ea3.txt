NAKED GIRL

smile 
you will be my shield 
you'll be the only thing 
anyone ever sees 
kill 
crush me, break my will 
cease the endless rats inside the walls 
that squeak and scratch away 
and keep me awake 

this is my vice that i will break 
this is my christ in arms today 
this is my golden chance 
to fight the odds that never seem to change 
ne'er seem to change 
ne'er seem to change 

today 

love 
don't hurt me this time 
be for real 
or kindly let this 
lonely soldier be 
fear 
my old friend disappear 
leave me to regard the world 
in better ways 
than what is wrong 
and what cannot be 

don't say you'll change
