MOTHER OF LOVE

he tries to play it safe
like he knows he should,
but he lives inside his mind
and his heart's in hollywood
and she'll never know
that every corner of his mind
holds a picture of her,
so he won't forget

down into his heart,
he's consumed with her
like a parasite
looking for a host in him
and she'll never know
'cause she's too far away,
and he's still a boy,
so he should just forget

holy mother of love,
we exalt thee
unto you all praise
and we thank thee
and we'll live out each day
to its fullest extent
it's just what we meant to do
from the start
