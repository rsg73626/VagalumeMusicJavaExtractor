PENNING THE PENULTIMATE

I know a lot more than they think
And with the radio on I try to go back to sleep

When all the world's posers blow smoke in my face I think of the love that I can make, but I struggle so hard for each breath that I take.

I get so sick that I can hardly speak, but with my head full of pills I try to go back to sleep. When you're sad but you force up a grin anyway it's hard not to feel fake, but I struggle so hard for each breath that I take.

Maybe some day I'll be at the top, and with my head in my hands I'll try to make it all stop.(just stop)* 
Every time I find love I choke so hard that for weeks my body aches, but I struggle so hard for each breath that I take.

And I struggle so hard for each breath that I take
And I struggle so hard for each breath...

be what you are
be what you are

When the world puts you down in its fear, at least you can know you've got it straight
We all struggle so hard for each breath that we take.
We all struggle so hard for each breath that we take.
And I struggle so hard for each breath that I take.
