A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE

A Captive Audience - The Velvet Teen 

i'm gonna make it go away, like it never happened 
like the author ran out of ink, before you got to me 
it doesn't matter, you have your answer 
my breath upon yer hand 
my breath upon yer hand 
cos we're never far from another life 
but i never wanted to make you spend the night 
with yer loneliest thoughts 
will you come around this time 
will i be left here 
ooh, love 
when so proudly we fail and all the optimists sing 
"yeah, we'll be that far" 
when we'll be that far behind 
it's the drug distraction 
they'll scream when i kick 
but for every moment that i get too close 
to the faceless void from which i stumbled 
it's only because my heart swells over 
and i misinterpret it, i dwell on my failures 
cos i had parents who taught me to love 
yeah, love was something 
they never knew 
they never cared about you anyway 
a hope vicarious, a captive audience 
even the people that you call your friends 
can fuck you over in the subtlest ways 
it'll be your comfort that you're always alone 
they never cared about you anyway 
they never cared 
they never care so much 
as when you've lost your way 
fire and brimstone where they lay me 
heaven help us for a way to get out of here 
ooh, love
