COUNTING BACKWARDS

maybe tomorrow marks the end 
of this painful phase we're in 
maybe the sunrise shows the way for us 
maybe the stars that fill your eyes 
are the stars that have been 
leading me my whole life 
just to end up with you 

but when you get too close 
i run and hide 
close your eyes, count backwards 
i don't give up 
without a fight 
here i come, i'll find you 
and love, i'm yours 
if you'll turn me out 
when you need me, i'll be there 
we hide and seek, but always leave 
hand in hand 

maybe this chapter marks the start 
of no more broken hearts 
maybe the letters all spell out happiness 
maybe the words aren't always kind, 
but they're never meant 
to make you feel alone, 
just to stand up to you 

and i'll carry you 
if you promise to carry me 
we'll carry we 
it's a simple thing 
you and me 

you and me
