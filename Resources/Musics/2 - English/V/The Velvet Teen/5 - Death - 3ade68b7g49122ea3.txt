DEATH

when my time has come 
i won't put up a fight 
i'll hold my breath and let it wash over me 
and all the words we said
all the words we said 
have a way of rubbing off
but i said them so your courage could come back 
and stay back 
stay back
when i am, i can 
they're all waiting for me 
these eyes, these hands 
let them wash over me 
and all the words we said
all the words we said 
have a way of rubbing off
but i said them so your courage could come backand run to your room while you're weeping 
i'll see you in your bed while you're sleeping 
well, farewell 
i won't hold you down 
no, i'll heal the cracks in your head 
heal the cracks in your head 
stay back
