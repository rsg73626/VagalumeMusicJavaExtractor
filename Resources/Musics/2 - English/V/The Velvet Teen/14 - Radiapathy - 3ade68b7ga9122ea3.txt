RADIAPATHY

i get out of bed the same way every day 
blurry eyed and waiting for the alarm to sing 
sing me into fm radiapathy 
numb and tired and perfect for the working day 

i get home and turn the cable strobe light on 
to tell me who i'm not and what my life still lacks 
yeah if i could make a copy of myself, i might 
so i could have twice as much of everything 

come, it's time to wake up 
know the way, you know the way 

so i tell the world that it can kill its own 
blow itself to smithereens for all i care 
i will ride the wave into its smoking hole 
i will be the vulture to its carriong
