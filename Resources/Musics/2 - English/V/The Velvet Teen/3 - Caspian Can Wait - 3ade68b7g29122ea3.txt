CASPIAN CAN WAIT

he waits for the greater silence 
as every day goes faster
a cipher he knows too well
of killing himself by looking closer

you got so much love locked up inside you
just waiting to come out
you'll heal the world in spite of itself
and make a better one
you say you're a veteran

he waits for the reign of his tyrants
to tire of their games, god save him
he'll be the one to fracture their fractus castles
and scatter their tiers on the pavement

you've got so much love locked up inside you
bursting at the seams
you'll kill the world in spite of itself
and make a better one
you say you're a veteran

caspian can wait sometimes
he'll be in the way sometimes
immortalized with every anguish we yield
this is our christening
nobody's listening

caspian can wait sometimes
he'll be in the way sometimes
immortalized with every anguish we sell
this is our chirstening
nobody's listening
