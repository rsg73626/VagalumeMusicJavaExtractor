YOUR LAST WORDS

do you hear that / that's your heartbeat / counting you down to your last words / do you feel it crawl down your skin / hands clutching your mouth / to stop them from coming out at all / but you don't, cause you can't cross yourself / it can be all you have sometimes / it's a spark, it's enough / to pull you on your feet / pumping your fits in the air / i'll show them all what you are / and this time, you won't get away / cause i'm kicking your teeth to the curb / you want it so take it, don't want to see you / you're the star / giving it all for the bright lights / think of all the money when you've everyone falling for your... / and if you don't mind / just leave me out of your (dirty money / plastic party) you're just stalling / living it up for a false start / don't call me when you're broken-heated and everyone's turning on you / do you hear that / that's your heartbeat / counting you down to your last words / when it all runs out, i'll be watching you / clutching your head / to stop the room from spinning round / too late, we're on a road to nowhere else / taking our time to pull you down / and i'm tired of taking my chances / i'm gonna let you / i'm gonna let you down / do what you want to / i'm gonna let you / i'm gonna let you down
