TOKYOTO

Oh, my home
Is a frozen lake
Shadows skate past
Figures, i say
I laughed out
At the lines they made
While overhead
They flicker and dissipate

Saying, i was born a spark
And i burned
Burned, myself a watemark
I left, myself a trail
To find my way
When i fell, a stray

And i walked a whale
Didn't rest, for many a day old
To sing, to say, oh
I will be again
I have already been

Oh, i know i am going home
But i don't know when
I don't know when

The foolish will crack
But i will be here again
To ruin and spit in
