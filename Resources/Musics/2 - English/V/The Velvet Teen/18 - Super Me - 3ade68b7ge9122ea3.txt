SUPER ME

He keeps to himself these days
Doesn't have much to talk about
But he tells himself over and again
"She'll be here soon."

Emotions are all the same
Maybe just love and lonliness

But that enlightenment doesn't help at all
It just makes it worse when she's not around
That's when the sky cries for him and

The lightning strikes
He's mesmerized

Oh, super me
You're all that I long to

Tries not to think too much
Everything makes him think of her
When reason escapes him
Love takes it's place

He's got a frame of mind
Which captures the bigger picture

But that enlightenment doesn't help at all
It just makes it worse when she's not around
That's when the sky cries for him and

The lightning strikes
He's mesmerized

If the end of the world came crashing down on him
He'd welcome it 
With open arms like an old friend

And oh, super me
You're all that I long to be
Searching the skies and to my surprise
We always end up
In each other's arms
You help me to the discern

As I fall apart
You willed me to start again, again

That's when the sky cries for him
The lightning strikes him down
With open arms like an old friend
