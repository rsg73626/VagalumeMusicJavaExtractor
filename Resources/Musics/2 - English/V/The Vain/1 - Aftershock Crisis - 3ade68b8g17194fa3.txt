AFTERSHOCK CRISIS

Aftershock Crisis

C´mon shine out, stay out, scream loud
You have troubles in your house that takes you out
Takes you
Takes you

C´mon burn out, punch out, yell loud
You have drugs in your bag that drags you out
They consume you
They consume you

But I have some dreams in life
Hunger flies had brought me life
Wanna breathe some good air
Wanna find somewhere to rest

Someone has pissed on my life
Wanna get guilty my own wife
Someone has pissed on my life
Wanna get guilty my own wife
I am my own property
Nobody will take me own
I am my own property

C´mon burn out, punch out, yell loud
You have drugs in your bag that drags you out
They consume you
They consume you

But I have some dreams in life
Hunger flies had brought me life
I want to breathe some good air
I want to find somewhere to rest

Someone has pissed on my life
I wanna get guilty my own wife
Someone has pissed on my life
I wanna get guilty my own wife
I am my own property
Nobody will take me own
I am my own property

Someone has pissed on my life
Wanna get guilty my own wife
Someone has pissed on my life
Wanna get guilty my own wife
I am my own property
Nobody will take me own
I am my own property
