DAILY HYMNS

Daily Hymns 

You think it´s easy to be a superhero
Someone that people will never understand
You said you´re going ahead buying masses
‘Cos out there you might never try to lend a hand

You may want to come up and
You may want to appear
In front of us in the daily hymns

You plea for a better chance to wave goodbye
But it tingles in every move you do
You rush to keep ourselves smiling over the crowd
And keep asking who might be this fool around

You may want to come up and
You may want to appear
In front of us in the daily hymns

You may want to come up and
You may want to appear
In front of us in the daily hymns
