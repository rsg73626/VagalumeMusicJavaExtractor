WRONG SONG

Wrong Song

You´re making me sad
With your blue eyes
With your smell
With you loud lament

We need many things
The water to rain
The wind to blow
A reason to help people

You may want to get it back but you won´t ‘cos you know it´s you
We´ve been playing the wrong song for you
You may want to get it back but you won´t ‘cos you know it´s true
We´ve been playing the wrong song for both of us

You´re making me sad
With your deep eyes
With your smile, with your love
With your tears

We need many things
A way to walk
Someone to love
A reason to cry for people

You may want to get it back but you won´t ‘cos you know it´s you
We´ve been playing the wrong song for you
You may want to get it back but you won´t ‘cos you know it´s true
We´ve been playing the wrong song for both of us

It´s on your hands
It´s on your hands
It´s on your hands
It´s on your hands
It´s on your hands
It´s on your hands
It´s all with you
