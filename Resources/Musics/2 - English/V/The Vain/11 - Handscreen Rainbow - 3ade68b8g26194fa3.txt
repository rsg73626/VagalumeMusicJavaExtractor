HANDSCREEN RAINBOW

Handscreen Rainbow

You can hide into it
You can shell yourself
You can lie to God
You can be selfish

Further tries makes hard
To pay the way you opened
Outside your car
With your bare hands

Please drive faster
Please drive faster
Please drive faster
Please drive 

You can fly with ghosts
You can sell your soul
ItÂ´s like a twist underneath your rainbow

Selling toys makes hard
To became a millionaire
The taste of blood
Makes you excited

Please drive faster
Please drive faster
Please drive faster
Please drive
