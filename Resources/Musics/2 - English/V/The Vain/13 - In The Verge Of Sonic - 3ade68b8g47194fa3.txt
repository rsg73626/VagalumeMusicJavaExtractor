IN THE VERGE OF SONIC

In The Verge Of Sonic

I can´t believe we´re in this speed
The lights they´re passing fast
I can´t recognize

If we´re moving faster, you don´t fear to let them come for us
If we´re moving faster, you don´t fear to let them come for us

I can´t believe we´re in this speed
The lights they´re passing fast
I can´t ignore them 

If we´re moving faster, you don´t fear to let them come for us
If we´re moving faster, you don´t fear to let them come for us
