BROTHERHOOD

Brotherhood

It´s hard to elevate your mind through what’s exciting involving you
We see all that we can, the great, even though that gap makes you suffer
Leave behind the fear of love

And we know, that it’s true, all the hearts, became one, hand by hand, feet by feet, we ascend, to go on

Believe, people out there close their eyes to don’t see the world they´re living
Even if there´s someone they love, work for and hug by the morning
Trusting their friends till the final line
But that torch had died

Still we know, that’s nature, and all the minds, became one, teeth by teeth, eye by eye, we shall rise, to go on

And we all go together
And we all go together
And we all go together
And we all go together
