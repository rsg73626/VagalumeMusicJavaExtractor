GHOSTS

Ghosts

Music is all I have in mind
Music that I had denied
Never thought you were a ghost
Now we live along the host

And it all feels so good
And it all feels so good

Magic is all I have in hands
Magic that I had created
Never thought you were so cruel
Now itÂ´s only me and you

And it all feels so good
And it all feels so good

And it all feels so good
And it all feels so good
