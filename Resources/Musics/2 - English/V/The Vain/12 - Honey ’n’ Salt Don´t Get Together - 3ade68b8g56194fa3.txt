HONEY ’N’ SALT DON´T GET TOGETHER

Honey ’n’ Salt Don´t Get Together

It´s hard to wake up when there´s no one around the bed to bring you coffee
Why you´re so afraid?
Honey and salt don´t get together so why you keep trying to mix them up
Are you crazy?

But tonight, oh na na na
Oh Baby baby please don´t go
I want you well, tonight

You´re standing there with two guns one on each hand
And you look like you don´t like me
Why don´t you shoot?
I´m the honey and you´re the salt and we won´t change those places
Because you´re bad and I´m just an angel

But tonight, oh na na na
Oh Baby baby please don´t go
I want you well
And when the sun doesn’t shine
And there´s no one around to save you, oh baby baby
Please don´t go away tonight

And when the sun doesn’t shine
And there´s no one around to save you, oh baby baby
Please don´t go away tonight
