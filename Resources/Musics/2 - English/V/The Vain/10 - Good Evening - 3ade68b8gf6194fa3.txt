GOOD EVENING

Good Evening

Good evening girl
The night is waking up for you
Everyone is on the streets
They´re looking for you
The stars will fade out
The moon will shine and shout
Good evening
Good evening
Good night

The places you used to live won´t be the same
The people you used to know are all insane
The friends that you must find all changed their name
The languages we´ll speak won´t be the same

It could be better
It could be better
It could be better
It could be better
It could be better
