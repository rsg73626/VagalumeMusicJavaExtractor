THE DEVIL LIES AMONG THE DRINKS

The Devil Lies Among The Drinks

You´re forgetting something
You´ve never had
Some crazy gossip
About the days you left

A strong feeling
About your past
Brought back the memories
Of the love we once had

But you may want to take my soul to your hell
And you can´t hide because I’ve found you
The devil lies among the drinks

You can´t resist it
I´m special
And changed your fate
To a way you always like

You´ll have to embrace moi
I made mistakes
But there won´t be better
That´s the way it always is

But you may want to take my soul to your hell
And you can´t hide because I’ve found you
The devil lies among the drinks
