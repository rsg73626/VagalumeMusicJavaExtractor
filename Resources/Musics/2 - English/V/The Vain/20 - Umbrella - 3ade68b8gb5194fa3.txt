UMBRELLA

Umbrella

In this kind of conversation you’re always ahead
Does anyone around rocked you to the vices of myself?
Have you invited someone that I don´t like to our party?
And we sit here watching the rain falls down

So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain
So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain

Could your visions lay down my spirit in good so I can feel my skin again?
We´re always trying to put ourselves against each other under this rain

Your manners and your habits won´t give us the chance to act like before
You said you had in your life a kind of strange and building metaphor

So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain
So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain

So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain
So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain
So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain
So I´ll take my umbrella just to be always hugging you under the rain
