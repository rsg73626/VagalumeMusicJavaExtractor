CREAM

Cream

I have no doubts, I´m living alone
I´ll run through the city looking for someone
I have no money and no time to waste
Just have my soul and my life to haste

I have no rights, I´m walking alone
Come on near and sing my name again
I can wake and start to bargain 
Just to look around and see what we´re in

I need to find a girl
So I can stay awake all night
I´m gonna make some coffee
So I can stay awake all night

I have nobody I could rely on
I have no family, no dog, no one to love
Just the money I use to drink
And some tears I use to cry

I need to find a girl
So I can stay awake all night
I´m gonna make some coffee
So I can stay awake all night
And I´m gonna mix some cream
So I can taste that smell all night
I´m gonna make some coffee
So I can stay awake all night
