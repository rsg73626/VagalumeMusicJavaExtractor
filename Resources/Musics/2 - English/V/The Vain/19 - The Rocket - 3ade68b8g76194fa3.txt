THE ROCKET

The Rocket

In your meaning life
Bombs were opening their way
So creative targeting home
When I first saw it knives were flying
Stones where falling outside and you were running

Take it to the countryside
WeÂ´re spots around the world
We are just components
We are just components

In a big liar, in a big real world
In a big liar, in a big real world
In a big liar, in a big real world
In a big liar, in a big real world
