BABYLON BLVD

Babylon Blvd.

Why, why, why, why?
Reality says it’s over
When we’ve just began

Hope that someday
That light lifts up higher into the space

No, no, no, no!
It can’t bring down damned nights
The sight is over what rests 

Beats of the past echoes 
This place has ended years ago

Hello, everything is over
Hello, everything is over
