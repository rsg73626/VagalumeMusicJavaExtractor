JACKETS & COATS

Jackets & Coats

In your lifestyle you changed a lot
Things you´ve made to feel a little more
Do you want to be called pop
But it seems that you will never change from this

But when will you learn?
Bu when will you know?
That it can go

And all you need is faith
In your jackets and coats
Feelings I´ll never understand
Intentions I´ll never know

In your lifestyle you change a lot
Thing you´ve made to appear a little more
Keep on hanging onto that fashion whores
But it seems you´ll never be like before

But when will you learn?
Bu when will you know?
That it can go

And all you need is faith
In your jackets and coats
Feelings I´ll never understand
Intentions I´ll never know
