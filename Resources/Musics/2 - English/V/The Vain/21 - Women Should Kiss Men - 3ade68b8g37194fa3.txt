WOMEN SHOULD KISS MEN

Women Should Kiss Men

That´s a thing that keeps boring me
You were always flirting
And the man is not so hot
He doesn´t look like me

It doesn´t matter why neither when
Women should kiss men 
It doesn´t matter why neither when
Women should kiss men

You keep this secret
But you lay your hands
Upon my perseverance

Why act so sexy
When you run so fast
I´m not a fool like the rest

It doesn´t matter why neither when
Women should kiss men
It doesn´t matter why neither when
Women should kiss men

It doesn´t matter why neither when
Women should kiss men
It doesn´t matter why neither when
Women should kiss men

And I don´t like it
And I don´t want it
But I won´t like it
Unless I´m in it
