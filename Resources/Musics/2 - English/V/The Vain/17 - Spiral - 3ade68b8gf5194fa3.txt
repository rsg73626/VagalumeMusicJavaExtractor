SPIRAL

Spiral

Confrontation was everything you need
Revolution was everything you tried with love
Never thought that it could be so hard
Day by day time passes and it is not enough

But 24 hours surrounds me and almost every day we use it to learn
But 24 hours surrounds me and almost every day we use it to learn

Congregation was everything you had
Reformation was everything you took inside
Can refrain but no satisfy
In this circle life goes on by

But 24 hours surrounds me and almost every day we use it to learn
But 24 hours surrounds me and almost every day we use it to learn
