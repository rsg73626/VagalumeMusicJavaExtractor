AGE OF PISCES

Age Of Pisces

While ours kids are running on the playground
We build places to think about war
Now it´s time to see if it´s going to change

While these men keep coming by
Bringing fortune to the lucky ones
Burning money from up to inside

And I´ll try, try, try, try
Try to change the world
And I´ll try, try, try, try
But it´ll keep the same

Only we can change it
Only we can change it
Only we can change it
Only we can change it

Now we´re tracking down those bad men
That poisoned the world and are living free
Has born the time to create a new line

While these men keep coming by
Bringing fortune to the lucky ones
Burning money from up to inside

And I´ll try, try, try, try
Try to change the world
And I´ll try, try, try, try
But it´ll keep the same

Only we can change it
Only we can change it
Only we can change it
Only we can change it
