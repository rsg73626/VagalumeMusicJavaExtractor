BEAUTIFUL VOICES

Beautiful Voices

You had defined the best thing you have
With all the time that we spend together
Now you know that the reason for everything is love
Carrying on all that you hold

Now there are beautiful voices waking you
Now there are beautiful voices waking you

I´ve lost all my sight I thought I wasn´t alive
Hope was dark and you were my only guiding light
I´ve waited too long to meet my friends and you alone
Had to share with me all of your heart

Now there are beautiful voices waking you
Now there are beautiful voices waking you

You can feel this way
Against all the things
That gets in your way
Turns winter in springs
I´ve love to know
That you´re the one I´ve waited

Now there are beautiful voices waking you
Now there are beautiful voices waking you
