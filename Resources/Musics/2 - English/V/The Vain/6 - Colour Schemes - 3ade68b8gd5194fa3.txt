COLOUR SCHEMES

The light is made from all the colors of the grade
And black is your soul in the edge of my blade
The blue and the pink, they´re the colors of our dreams
That shows us off
The blue, the red, the grey 
They´re the colors of the blood of our prey
That took us down into a place that we may try to escape…

But it fails
Now it´s chaos

Yellow is the color of the gold you used to buy your soul
Your children, your love, everyone you know
People that want to see this world in green
Maybe ‘cos they can´t see that…

The red, the red is the color that paints those fields
That once had life and now there’s only death
The bodies that now lie dead had tried to fight
For us…

But it fails
Now it´s chaos
