ALIEN

Don’t go on screaming, you look strange to an alien. 
And set the fires gleaming across the nation. 
Well I know, I know how to run this world.

Don’t make me put you through hell. 
And don’t make me do this to you.

So bring your rebels with their troubles 
And you’ll go down bleeding alive 
Begging for the mercy of mine.
