THE SONG OF ARIEL

Oh Ariel, the stars were left for you.
Oh Ariel, your ghost was cut in two.
Cause it’s a carnival for animals, to be mated and numbered.
Cause it’s a place for dying memories, where barons say what’s true.

And I can hear their voices coming through, with ear splitting rhetoric over you.

Don’t lay down and sigh, like a pet to be used.
Don’t lay down and sigh, trained and mute.
Oh Ariel, I would die for you.
Oh Ariel, you can still say what’s true.
