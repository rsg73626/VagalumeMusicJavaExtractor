COME TOGETHER

Here come old flat top 
He come groovin' up slowly 
He got joo joo eyeballs 
He want holy rollers 
He got hair down to his knees 
Got to be a joker 
He just do what he please 

He wear no shoeshine 
He got toe jam football 
He got monkey finger 
He shoot Coca Cola 
He say I know you, you know me 
One thing I can tell you is 
You got to be free 
Come together, right now 
Over me 

Come together right now 
Come together right now 
Come together right now 
Over me
