I LOVE ROCK N' ROLL

I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me

I saw him dancing there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about 17
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till she was with me
Yeah with me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till she was with me
Yeah with me
Singin'

I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me

She smiled so I got up and asked for her name
But that don't matter she said cuz it's all the same
He said can I take you home
Where we can be alone
And next we're moving on and she was with me
Yeah me
And next we're moving on and she was with me
Yeah me
Singin'

I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me

And next we're moving on and she was with me
Yeah me
And we'll be moving on and singing that same old song
Yeah with me
Singin'

I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
