GIMME SHELTER (HANNAH KIRBY VS. SARAH POTENZA)

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
My very street today
(And) burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


The floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Love, sister
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away
Love, sister
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
