CRAZY - JULIO IGLESIAS

Crazy 
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely 
I'm crazy 
Crazy for feeling so blue 

I knew 
You'd love me as long as you wanted 
And then someday 
You'd leave me for somebody new 

Worry 
Why do I let myself worry 
Wonderin' 
What in the world did I do 

Crazy 
For thinkin' that my love could hold you 
I'm crazy for tryin' 
I'm crazy for cryin' 
And I'm crazy for lovin' you 

Crazy 
For thinkin' that my love could hold you 
I'm crazy for tryin' 
I'm crazy for cryin' 
And I'm crazy for lovin' you
