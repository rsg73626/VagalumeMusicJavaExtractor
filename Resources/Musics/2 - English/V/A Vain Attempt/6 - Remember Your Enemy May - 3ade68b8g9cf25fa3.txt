REMEMBER YOUR ENEMY MAY

I ain't giving up, I've found my way, out of life.
I've always tried to take my life. I beg for death!
Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer.
Find your way to act, find the time, find the time to set it free.

Bless this last minute, 'cause it's your final one.
Take the chance to crave, one final wish fulfilled.
Bless this last minute, 'cause it's your final one.
Take the chance to crave.

I bet it's past, don't try ignore. The lies within are my drug.
Self deceit is a crime. Hear me out, just listen.
I will call to say goodnight, to say goodnight.
And I will call to say goodnight.

Creep into the night, creep, behold! 
So you can't suspect my presence.
Bless this last minute, 'cause it's your final one.
Take this chance to crave, one final wish fulfilled.

I bet it's past, don't try ignore. The lies within are my drug.
Self deceit is a crime. Hear me out, just listen.
I will call to say goodnight, to say goodnight.
I say, you stare! Closer.

I bet it's past, don't try ignore. The lies within are my drug.
Self deceit is a crime. Hear me out, just listen.
I will call to say goodnight, to say goodnight.
And I will call to say goodnight.

You've always tried to be, the only one for me. I see: you're sore.
