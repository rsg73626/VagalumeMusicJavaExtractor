BUBBLEWORLD

I'm so sick of this boring empty town
All I do is work and have no life
I'm stucked in this with all my dreams
I can't escape from my cage
All I want is to escape from all my needs
Not to worry about my life and how it seems

To carry me on
Straight into this bubbleworld
Just let me, just let me go
Don't break me down

Don't tear us down
I won't survive
I'm soo sick of all this shit
Breaking us apart from everything
All that I want, is to live my life without
All thoose fucking rules you have
Cause it's breaking the world apart

I know someday I will go far
When I'm finished I will be a drunk rockstar
And I will laugh and spin
This shit right back into your mouth
And soon enough I will fly away
Leave this this planet and I won't see your face
I will destroy your tiny little bubbleworld

Just let me, just let me go
Don't break me down
Don't tear us down
I won't survive
I'm soo sick of all this shit
Breaking us apart from everything
All that I want, is to live my life without
All thoose fucking rules you have
Cause it's breaking the world apart

I never gonna be the same person that you knew
I got my dreams and all my hope
I turned to reality
I never wanna be there again
I never wanna see your face
I never wanna be there again
All thanks to this bubbleworld
