THE RIOT

Raise your glass
Do it again!
Raise your glasses, the party has just begun
And tonight we're gonna have fun
So grab your beer and don't forget, to throw it at your homie

And tonight, we ain't gonna pass out in the pool
Cause we gonna throw down all the fools
So don't you dear to try discuss
Then it's gonna happen
Come on fuckers grab your beer
Then you will see beauties everywhere
I'm almost there

We won't leave before it's dark
Call the cops and be a star
We don't care (they won't care)
You can leave if you wanna
We won't leave this house tonight
We just wanna start a fight
Do you care (I don't care)
Let's go start a riot

Can you see, everybody
Got their mood, to hang around the pool
It feels so good in hollywood, we bet you also feel it
And tonight we aint gonna be the same
When we walk out with the shame
And that's okay, cause we don't care
Tomorrow we're back

Come on fuckers grab your beer
Then you will see beauties everywhere
I'm almost there
We won't leave before it's dark
Call the cops and be a star
We don't care (they won't care)
You can leave if you wanna

We won't leave this house tonight
We just wanna start a fight
Do you care (I don't care)
Let's go start a riot
