I CAN'T ESCAPE

You screaming back, you think that Im okey, just to you, but I lied, to make a difference, Im hiding myself just tonight

Those razors hurt, I cant feel fine my love here tonight, tonight
Bye bye to this, I cant feel fine my love here tonight, tonight

I seem to be away and you will push me on and on and on
I see the light I cant escape

I seem to be away and you will push me on and on and on
I see the light I cant escape

You screaming back, you know that I obey, just tonight, I have so much pain, YOU! I caused myself harm, for you right now

Those razors hurt, I cant feel fine my love here tonight, tonight
Bye bye to this, I cant feel fine my love here tonight, tonight

I seem to be away and you will push me on and on and on
I see the light I cant escape

I seem to be away and you will push me on and on and on
I see the light I cant escape

This will be the last time I talk to you, for right now, I say I hate you
What you did to me right know I can just say I hate you

I seem to be away and you will push me on and on and on
I see the light I cant escape

I seem to be away and you will push me on and on and on
I see the light I cant escape

i cant escape from you, escape from you, escape from you, you did to me, i cant escape your hell, right now it hurts
