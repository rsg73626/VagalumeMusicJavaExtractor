BEASTERWISSER

I've got a monster inside my
Chest who just want's to break through
I'm so sick of all this bullshit that you've put me into
You're not alone, just ask your girlfriend to
I have fucked her twice and she asked me what to do

You think you know it
I got a secret
I like to fuck things up
Here I go, and there's nothing you can do
Standing up against the wall again
As you know, there is nothing you can do
Leave my friends and the girls are blind

Last year you had me by your side
And I looked up to you
I watched you back when things
Went wrong, how could you stab me to
Can you belive
You ripped the beast out of me
Can't you just see
The mad man inside of me

You think you know it
I got a secret
I like to fuck things up
Here I go, and there's nothing you can do
Standing up against the wall again
As you know, there is nothing you can do
Leave my friends and the girls are blind

There is nothing you can do
Leave my friends and the girls are blind
Here I go, and there's nothing you can do
Standing up against the wall again
As you know, there is nothing you can do
Leave my friends and the girls are blind
