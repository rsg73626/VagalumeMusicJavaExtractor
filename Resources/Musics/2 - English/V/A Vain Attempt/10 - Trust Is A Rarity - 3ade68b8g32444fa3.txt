TRUST IS A RARITY

I will not pretend, you’ll make me descend, I will not feel prosperity
Times like these will change, but it’s not in range, cannot reach my ability, to say:
That I’ll soon be ready, just to standing steady, then im climbing higher, again
My life is a riddle, Im caught in the middle, between the fire

Woooooooooooo, what is wrong with me? I wanted you to be, my everything everything
Woooooooooo, what is wrong with me? I wanted you to see, that you were everything, everything to me

I hope your feeling guilty, why your thoughts are filthy, dont know what to do
My life is a riddle, Im caught in the middle

Woooooooooooo, what is wrong with me? I wanted you to be, my everything everything
Woooooooooo, what is wrong with me? I wanted you to see, that you were everything everything to me

This ain’t the love, this ain’t the love, that’s from above
This ain’t the joy, this ain’t the joy, that I wished for

Woooooooooooo, what is wrong with me? I wanted you to be, my everything everythiiing
Woooooooooo, what is wrong with me? I wanted you to see, that you were everything everything to meee

This ain’t the love, this ain’t the love, that’s from above
This ain’t the joy, this ain’t the joy, that I wished for
This ain’t the love, this ain’t the love, that’s from above
(This ain’t the love), i’ve been imagine (this ain’t the love) i’ve been imagine
