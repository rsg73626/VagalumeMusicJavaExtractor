BATTLERGROUND

Why, do we always set our selfs in this situations?
Too many beer and shots, and, we're there again
Let's make a change, let's make a change
Because you drive me insane
This is a battleground for you to
Break me down, why do you do this
Spit on me, push me hard
But you will not be the reason that I fall

I don't care what you say, I don't care what you say
I can't handle your fucking game any more
I don't know why, but this is really happening
Let's make a change, let's make a change
Because you drive me insane

This is a battleground for you to
Break me down, why do you do this
Spit on me, push me hard
But you will not be the reason that I fall
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you say

Let's make a change, let's make a change
This is a battleground for you to
Break me down, why do you do this
Spit on me, push me hard
But you will not be the reason that I fall
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you say
