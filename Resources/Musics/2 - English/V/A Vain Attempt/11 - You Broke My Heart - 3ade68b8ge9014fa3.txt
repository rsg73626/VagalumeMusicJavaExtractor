YOU BROKE MY HEART

You broke my heart

you know that I want you, I want you, every day
you know that I miss you, I miss you, by my side

she broked my heart and you broked my life too
she is bad because she broked up with me too

so take my advice wherever you lies and made me alone
cuz' when you're dead, when you're dead, I'll write to you

she broked my heart and you broke my life too
she is bad because she broked up with me too

you know that I want you, I want you, every day
you know that I miss you, I miss you, by my side

she broked my heart and you broked my life too
she is bad because she broked up with me too

she broked when I tried to when I befalled
whenever time we touch I get this feeling, that's not for me

she broked my heart and you broked my life too
she is bad because she broked up with me too
