THIS FUNERAL WASN'T MEANT FOR YOU

This funeral wasn't meant for you
I cry my tears, and they all for you
I hear your call, from the nightmare of my fall
The roses turn to wine, when the angels starts to cry

N' now you're dead, and I can't sleep and I will miss your face
Time and time again I blame you, for not keeping me alive

I try to comprehend, why you aren't with me, to live this life
But now when you are dead, I finally see that, we're meant to be

This funeral wasn't meant for you

I try to comprehend, why you aren't with me, to live this life
But now when you are dead, I finally see that, we're meant to be

We're scarred

I try to comprehend, why you aren't with me, to live this life
But now when you are dead, I finally see that, we're meant to be
I try to comprehend, why you aren't with me, to live this life
But now when you are dead (you're dead) I finally see that, (tell me) we're meant to be
