SHE WAS A PRINCESS WHO HAD IT ALL UNTIL THE DAY SHE DISAPPEARED

You did this again

Made by tears, it was so obvious
That you would fall, all apart
I can't see your ribs, did the princess take them to
Can't see she's gone by her own

Let's begin to fight, let's make it rain blood tonight
Cause I hope you'll do your best, to at least find her chest
If you going through a cell, I will send you to hell
With my sword, right through your chest

And will you fight for me until the sun rise?

Let's begin to fight and you will be so far from me
Do you realise? What you did to me
Born in a castle
How could you throw it all away?

Cut my throat and leave me here to bleed with nothing left from you
This will be the end of me and you
She tried to be the one but now she's gone
Blood running through my veins 

Let's begin to fight and you will be so far from me
Do you realise? What you did to me
Born in a castle
How could you throw it all away?

She was a princess who had it all, until the day when she disappeared,
But I'll never give up the hope about finding her again

I'll never give up the hope, to find her again 
For god sake you cant be dead, I found her dead tonight 
I'll take suicide for your sake, I cut my throat for you 
I found a reason to blame on you, the knights will follow you
