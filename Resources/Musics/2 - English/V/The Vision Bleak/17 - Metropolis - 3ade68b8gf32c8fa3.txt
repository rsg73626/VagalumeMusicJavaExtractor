METROPOLIS

A monument of insane thoughts,
clad in iron hellfire.
The massive towers of Babylon,
leading way up to the sky...

And deep below, the underground-
the odem of a soulless world.
The giant clockwork that swallows all,
ticks all life away....

That's Metropolis...
A thousand men of broken hope,
slaves to the devil's machine.
Kept alive, by iron lounges,
down in Metropolis city.

The massive towers of babylon,
leading way up to the sky.
And deep below, the underground-
the odem of a soulless world.

That's Metropolis...
