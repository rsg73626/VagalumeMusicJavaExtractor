INTO THE UNKNOWN

Step into the dark, drag yourself along the twine
That's been out there and was spun
For you since a long time
Allow the pain
So agony can teach its exalted secrecy
Overcome the fear
Take yourself into the great
Maelstrom's whirling eye

With mind aloof and heart aflame
I shall never be the same
Into the unknown where the obscure reigns
I shall never be again, the same again!

Nocturnal pathways call, hear them now, summon you
Heavy fogs that enshroud the mind, dim your view
Look upward and from the firmament
Pluck the stars inflame
From the light and from the dark within
You will know your very name

With mind aloof and heart aflame
I shall never be the same
Into the unknown where the obscure reigns
I shall never be again

With mind aloof and heart aflame
I shall never be the same
Into the unknown where the obscure reigns
I shall never be again, the same again!

I shall never be the same!
I shall never be again, the same again!
