BY OUR BROTHERHOOD WITH SETH

Thou, dweller of the nightsky whose voice is thunder and storm,
thy allies are chaos and glory, thy realm is darkness adorn.
Thou, slayer of Apophis who died a thousandfold death,
bringer of light - blessing and bane.

Six is the number,
thy name is Seth.

Adversary of the onesided, grant us thy magical will.
Great is thy power - ferocious thy wrath,
thy brilliant endeavour - we shall fulfill.

Seth Io!
The old typhonic beast.
Seth Io!
To thee we are sworn...

By our brotherhood with Seth sacred to us is thy glorious strife!
Patron of rebellion! The great Horus Eye - it is ours...

By our brotherhood!
