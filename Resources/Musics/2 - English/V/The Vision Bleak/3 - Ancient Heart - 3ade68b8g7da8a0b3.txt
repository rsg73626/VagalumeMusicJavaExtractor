ANCIENT HEART

The heart
The heart is old

Antiqua nobilis et fortis anima

Precious and strong, unrivaled heart
Invincible and never wrong
Wise from the start!

Antiqua nobilis et fortis anima
The heart, the heart is old

Let loose from the chain!
Untamed and arcane is my ancient heart
Most sublime blood in endless flood
Through my ancient heart

Fire and flame of unwavering aim
My ancient heart, my ancient heart

Antiqua nobilis et fortis anima
The heart, the heart so pure

Most sublime blood in endless flood
Through my ancient heart
Let loose from the chain!
Untamed and arcane is my ancient heart

Ravishing pride, the self undefiled
In my ancient heart, the ancient heart
