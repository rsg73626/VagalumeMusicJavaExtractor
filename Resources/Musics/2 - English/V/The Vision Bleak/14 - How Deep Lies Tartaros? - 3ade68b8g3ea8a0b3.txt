HOW DEEP LIES TARTAROS?

I know the entrance to a place
Where dark shadows reign!
Once you've fallen in disgrace
In their spell you will remain

Tartaros, chasm vast!
Tartaros, abyss of past!

Tartaros, tartaros!

Trembling, naked I lie!
Licked by tongues of flames so cold
Here abandon has no ally!
Notions so cruel that endlessly unfold

Where the pain, where regret
Where the dark compulsion dwells!

Tartaros, tartaros!

There is no exit from this place
Where past shadows dwell!
For in their tight embrace
Lies the deepest hell

Where the pain, where regret
Where the dark is the truth!

Tartaros, no way to flee
Tartaros, abyss within me
Tartaros, no way to flee
Tartaros, abyss within me
