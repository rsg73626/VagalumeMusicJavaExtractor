SHE-WOLF

A gold-horned moon hung high - its heart began to beat.
With the fire of its eye no ember could compete.
Wolf-fiend, Mannwolf, Loup Garoux. Olden Legend born anew?
Human nature - woven heart. Who seized that fire? By what black art?
Its sinews twisted fury, desire's its portray
and the senses readily receive the scent of prey
The shepherds fear its madness and their lambs do flee.
For they know a secret: She is the wolf - The wolf is she!

Roaming the night
in splendour profound.
Revel in delight
by darkness abound.

Graceful thy cruelty
ruthless the claw
crowned with a beauty
that none can withdraw.

A gold-horned moon hung high - her blood began to flow.
Ordained to be a mortal sin - phenomenon from head to toe.
Jewel-crowned huntress - mother of all. What secret spell did her enthral?
Human nature - wolf a heart. Who seized that fire? Whose work of art?

Roaming the night
in splendour profound.
Revel in delight
by darkness abound.

A gold-horned moon hung high - her heart began to beat.
With the fire of her eyes no ember could compete.
Her sinews twisted fury - desire-s her portray
and her senses readily receive the scent of prey.
She is the wolf - the wolf is she!
