THE WHINE OF THE CEMETERY HOUND

Forgotten and forlorn
Graveyard corridors
Remains with mold adorn
Voiceless orators

Been haunting here so long
Observing everything decompose
Tombstones that sink into the ground
Until they are all gone

Assimilating stillness into grave poetry
In these vaults so lightless
Being home to me

This is my kingdom!
Reich of the dead!
Where shapes sepulchral
In patience outspread

The quietus, the fall!
O' ruin and decay
Ash and dust, earth and stone!
O' gray pits of dismay

Time has no sense in the realm of the dead
Where silver-tonqued souls are quietly met

This is my kingdom!
Reich of the dead!
Shrouded in myth
The idle imbed
