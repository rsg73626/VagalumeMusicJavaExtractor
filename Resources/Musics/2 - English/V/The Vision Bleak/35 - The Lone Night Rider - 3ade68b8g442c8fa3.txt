THE LONE NIGHT RIDER

When night has fallen dark and cold,
and mists rise up from ground of old.
When fullmoon lights the earth in fright,
the lone grim rider chills the night...

Here come's the lone night rider,
this is his melody...
His victims might not know it yet,
their head is what he's out to get!

Here come's the lone night rider,
this is his melody...
He takes away your pleasure,
this is your vision bleak!
