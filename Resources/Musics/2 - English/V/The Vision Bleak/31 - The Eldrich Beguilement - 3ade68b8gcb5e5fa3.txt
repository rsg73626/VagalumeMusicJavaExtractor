THE ELDRICH BEGUILEMENT

In the veil of the night I wandered about,
at the bole of a tree it did light.
I deemed it a stone at first glance, no doubt,
something in me was lured by its sight.
First feeble and dim but then it did shine
in the shade and the colours of gold.
Thither I hurried, no longer I strolled,
methought it was something divine.
Firmly I grasped it and now I beheld,
no precious did someone bequeath.
I tossed it from me and I terribly yelled...
a skull with a golden teeth!
First feeble and dim but the it did shine
in the shade and the colours of gold.
That thing of aghast it rolled and it rolled
till it stopped at one place of malign.

Led by a dream
by light deceived,
light-hearted I strolled
through the night.

But what the horror
of that ghastly thing?
It is just a burial site...

God may know why I frantically graved,
where that death's head did cover the ground -
but what did I see! - unsound and depraved,
my remains and their burial mound.

Led by a dream
by light deceived,
light-hearted I strolled
through the night.

But what the horror
of that ghastly thing
did show me my burial site.
