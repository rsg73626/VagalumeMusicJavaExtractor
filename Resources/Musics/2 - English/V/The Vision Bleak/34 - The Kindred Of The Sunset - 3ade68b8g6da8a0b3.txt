THE KINDRED OF THE SUNSET

Like a drapery falling downward
The dark spreads out in exquisite elegance
Melancholy reaching climax
Betimes you feel its wraith in all the elements

Aflame, the heavens seem to burn now untamed
While the earth is clad
In a luscious blueish dress
Ignite, these candles need to burn now
The night unveils its echoing spook of death!

We are the kindred of the sunset
We are to fade!
We seem like a blackened silhouette

We are the children of the sunset!
We know we are
To burn a blaze of night ahead

We are the kindred of the sunset!
We are the children of the sunset!

We are to fade, we seem
We know, we are to burn

Nocturnal haze is coming forth
A ghost devouring my secrecies
Gliding over fields as mist
Wailing grievously

Extinct, the heavens seem to burn no more
The earth is clad in a funeral dress
Elapse, the hourglass got turned once more
So pleased we sip the elixir of death

We are the kindred of the sunset
We are to fade!
We seem like a blackened silhouette

We are the children of the sunset!
We know we are
To burn a blaze of night ahead

We are the children of the sunset!
We are the kindred of the sunset!
A blackened silhouette!
