DEATHSHIP SYMPHONY

Through moorland mist and fullmoon light -
we claimed the devil-tongues!
We sailed the sea in ghoulish night,
salt water filled our lounges...

We made our way through frost and snow,
under arctic skies.
Through monuments of steel - below! -
A shadow did arise...
With fear you will stumble,
before the deamons you will see.

From the grottos of hell to the dark
skies above -

The Deathship Symphony!
Once darkness has fallen,
there is no return!

Cursed to sail the sea of the damned

- The Deathship Symphony!
