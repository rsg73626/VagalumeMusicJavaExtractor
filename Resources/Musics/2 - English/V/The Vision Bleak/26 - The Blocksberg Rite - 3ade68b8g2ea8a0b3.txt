THE BLOCKSBERG RITE

They gather in the mountains
Where rain falls not far to the ground
Among the primal fountains
And forests of silence profound

A secret glade elected
Between tall stony walls
From unbidden sights protected
The rite begins as dusk falls

The fullmoon rises beyond the wooden crest
Fires ignite everywhere for their highest guest
At his arrival the feast shall now unfold
The thirtyfirst of april, as it is foretold

Demons ride the moonlit sky
Torches light their way up high
To unclose walpurgis night
In the feral mountainside
Witches of all age
And kin give themself to lust and sin

Come as maiden, leave as bride
Satan's joy, the blocksberg rite

As if in trance they revel
Dance through the nightly sphere
In honour of the devil
Whom they all hold dear

At dawn it ends with a sudden turn
Witches disappear, fires cease to burn
The sun on the horizon hails the mountain seam
Another year must pass
'til flames again shall gleam

Demons ride the moonlit sky
Torches light their way up high
To unclose walpurgis night
In the feral mountainside
Witches of all age
And kin give themself to lust and sin

Come as maiden, leave as bride
Satan's joy, the blocksberg rite

The blocksberg rite
