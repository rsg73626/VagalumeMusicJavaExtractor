THE BLACK PHARAOH TRILOGY - PART III: THE VAULT OF NEPHREN-KA

In a valley of no sound, buried under desert ground,
encloses by night without one star - lies the vault of Nephren-Ka.

It calls... and calls...

Where isolation dies alone, an ancient deathlessness does throne,
shun by the light of Amun-Ra - that is the vault of Nephren-Ka.

This Nether-Netherworld is crowned by rotten sorcery abound,
where on old bones the ghoul-fiends gnaw - in the vault of Nephren-Ka.

It calls... and calls...

And the unsound fingers still grasp a crystal by its will,
beddes on an ill altar - the remains of Nephren-Ka.
