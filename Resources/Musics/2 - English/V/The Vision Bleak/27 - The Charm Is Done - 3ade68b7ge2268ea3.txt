THE CHARM IS DONE

[Scene VII]

Alone and confused - he looms in the cold shadows of the residence.

Now here I stand - shadow engulfed
Truth at hand, yet unresolved
The Mystery, that holds me tight
To lore and craft of shade and night

In dreary hours, dreams did unfold
And prophecies that have been told
Appeared to me as plain unreal
But destiny hath broke the seal

The charm is done, the seal is broken
In every part of mine chaos hath been woken

The spell fulfilled - darkness has won
No thing could ever bring me back - the charm is done!

I shall dwell in the abyss - in glory and in wonder!
In spheres in which my blackened heart forever mayest ponder...
...in darkness
