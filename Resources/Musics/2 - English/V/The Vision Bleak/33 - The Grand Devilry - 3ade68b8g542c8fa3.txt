THE GRAND DEVILRY

He is the wolf
that haunts the night
and the full moon's
blasphemous light.

He is the apple
that brought us sin
and he is evil
on the murderers grin...

If you feel fear it is the devil,
the old comrade of the dark
and if you hide you will fail to see,
the grand devilry!

So if you hate it is his stage,
he plays the wicked and the wretched
and if you hide you will fail to see
the grand devilry!

He is the poison
in our heart.
The flaming word
in each poets art.

He is the weapon
that leads through war
and he is the light
of the morningstar...

If you feel fear it is the devil,
the old comrade of the dark
and if you hide you will fail to see,
the grand devilry!

So if you hate it is his stage,
he plays the wicked and the wretched
and if you hide you will fail to see
the grand devilry!
