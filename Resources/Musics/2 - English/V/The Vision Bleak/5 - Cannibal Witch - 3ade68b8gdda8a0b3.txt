CANNIBAL WITCH

Where the wild winds blow in their desolate roar
Where lone pines bow their heads in grief
Where flowers cease to grow
And where the birds don't sing no more
Deep in the forests that none can ever leave

There you can see her fly across the evening sky
In her mortar, a pestle she swings
Even the moon does hide from her despiteous ride
For she is evil amongst all other things

Bone mother
Deathless crone

The cannibal witch!
She feast on human flesh in secrecy
The cannibal witch!
Crushing them bones in grinding glee

Her hunger is enormous, so are her iron teeth
Baba yaga bony legs, the cannibal witch

Her crooked hut lays concealed in a grove unsound
Wreathed by a fence made of skulls and bones
Even the night congeals when it hears the sound
Of snoring nostrils and horrid groans

She came to lunacy through endless sorcery
And thousand days of lonesomeness
She is the arch crone, goddess unknown
She brings rebirth which implies death

Bone mother
Deathless crone

The cannibal witch!
She feast on human flesh in secrecy
The cannibal witch!
Crushing them bones in grinding glee

Her hunger is enormous, so are her iron teeth
Baba yaga bony legs, the cannibal witch
