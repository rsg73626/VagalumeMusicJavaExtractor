THE BLACK PHARAOH TRILOGY - PART I: THE SHINING TRAPEZOHEDRON

An ancient shining crystal of non-euclidean form
made of no earthly matter in a primal cosmic storm.
It flew amongst the chaos in a time before the light
until it reached these planes in the foulest of all nights.
To the ice we call antartic it was bought - and treasured there
and the secret of Lemuria could not withstand its stare.
It had sunken with Atlantis to the deepest of the sea
and now the greed of Khem's merchants at last sold it to me.

Shine!
The starry light may shine.
So wisdom shall be mine
from all space and time.

Shine!
O haunter of the dark.
My soul shall now be thine,
thy knowledge must be mine.

I gazed into its window (and) saw the three lobed burning eye,
the titan blur on black wings - now I am it and it is I!
Black Pharaoh they call me though Nephren-Ka's my name
and among the folk of (the) Nile I spread my poison reign.

Shine!
The starry light may shine.
So wisdom shall be mine
from all space and time.

Shine!
O haunter of the dark.
My soul shall now be thine,
thy knowledge must be mine.
