KUTULU

[Scene VI]

The priest goes into a detailed description of the unholy rite
That did cast the evil spell onto our main character.

A moonless sky, midnight was nigh
No sound did break the still
A strange mystique
Was fellt in all
A spirit that seemed
Wrong and ill

Suddenly the cold winds blew
And coyotes howled afar
A mighty thunder shattered the earth
The growl of grand GNAA

Whisp'ring voices could be heard
Utt'ring a foul spell
Man circled 'round a secret stone
And summoned greatest hell

Cold blades did light in darkness
And the high priestess
Started the unholy rite...

IA! IA! KTULU FTHAGHN!
IA! R'LYEH! KTULU FTHAGN!

Blood was shed unto the stone
That raised into the air
And from the ground crept
What seemed snakes,
But God know what was there!

Cold blades did light in darkness
And all the desert
Seemed to join the blasphemy

IA! IA! KTULU FTHAGHN!
IA! R'LYEH! KTULU FTHAGN!
