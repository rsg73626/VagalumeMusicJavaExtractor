THE WOOD HAG

Lost in the forest endlessly deep
Betrayed by their kin, exposed to decease
Where darkness prevailed and the wind blew cold
Despair grew within these little souls

There appeared a hut in the dark
They knocked at the door with a trembling heart
Dismal it seemed, but was there a choice?
A portal then opened in a blood curdling noise

What do you fear when the moon stands tall?
The wood, the wood, the wood hags call!
Who lures the young and the lonesome kids?
The wood, the wood, the wood hag 'tis!

Who is as grim as the winter's cold?
The wood, the wood, the wood hag old!
Who cooks them all in her stove in bliss?
The wood, the wood, the wood hag 'tis!

Locked in a cage to be a mere dish
Cattle they were of the evil wood witch
How could they escape from this dreadful impasse?
Waiting for death to be eaten at last!

What do you fear when the moon stands tall?
The wood, the wood, the wood hags call!
Who lures the young and the lonesome kids?
The wood, the wood, the wood hag 'tis!

Who is as grim as the winter's cold?
The wood, the wood, the wood hag old!
Who cooks them all in her stove in bliss?
The wood, the wood, the wood hag 'tis!
