PESTA APPROACHES

From where she came no one could tell
The greatest evil of its time
Medieval curse sent from the depth of hell
That covered all in deathly grime

First she swept the cities inexorable
Her name was written in the sky
Then she reached the realms of the forlorn lands
And there you saw pesta fly

In the pompous halls and the beggars lairs
She crept upwards the stairs
From the mighty fjords to the desolate shores
In the northern sky, pesta fly!

With rake and broom she traveled
All corners she would clean
Over sea and river and in the forests deep
Her sanguinary shape was seen

She rode the night sky on icy winds of death
And all was covered soon by her putrid breath
Reaching the out most of all deserted plains
Leaving them all in their plague-ridden pain

In the pompous halls and the beggars lairs
She crept upwards the stairs
From the mighty fjords to the desolate shores
In the northern sky, pesta fly!

In the pompous halls
She crept upwards the stairs
From the mighty fjords
In the northern sky

Pesta fly!
