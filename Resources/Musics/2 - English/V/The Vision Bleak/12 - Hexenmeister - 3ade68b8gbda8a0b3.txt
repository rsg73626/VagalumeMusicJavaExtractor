HEXENMEISTER

Heretic, sorcerer, fallen son
Tied by a promise to the infernal one
A pact was to be signed in blood
To renounce the holy spirit and god

At a crossroad a circle was drawn
Into the magic of the burning pentagram
Summoning the fiery prince of hell
Conjured by an old necromantic spell

The smell of sulphur filled the night
Seven demons appeared in the unlight
They handed him the pact in bliss
And descented back into the black abyss

Granted he was with youth
Thirty years of joy, wisdom and truth
He indulged in the fleshly delight
A witchking he became of the greatest height

When the time came for the fallen son
He went to hell with the infernal one
For a pact was signed in blood
To blaspheme the holy spirit and god
