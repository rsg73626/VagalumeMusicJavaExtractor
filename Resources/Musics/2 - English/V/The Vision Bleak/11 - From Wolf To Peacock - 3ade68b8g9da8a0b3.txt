FROM WOLF TO PEACOCK

Since the first of hours, of childhood and thereon
In all my views and pond'rings, I have felt alone
Beauty I had savored in other sights than all
And a twisted grandeur I've seen in things that fall

I always found fulfillment, being on my own
And in my plays and passions I hit my distinct tone
From their source of delights, peace I never found
But from deep within me, my true self was unbound

Enter the wolf!

Night hunt, so cold!
Wolf heart, so lone!

Soul eyes, so blind!
Dark star, so bright

Sprawling was my anger, being chained to their
Notions uniforms and ambitions so austere
But that wrath transcended to a thing divine
Creations and catharsis and pride, they were all mine

Pride alike the peacock, I felt it to the core
From every cell and marrow, its results did outpour
Like the bird's adornment the wheel magnificent
It had manifested in beauty of no end

Now spread thy wheel!
