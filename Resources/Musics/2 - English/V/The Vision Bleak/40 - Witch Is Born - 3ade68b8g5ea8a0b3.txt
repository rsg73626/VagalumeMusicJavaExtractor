WITCH IS BORN

Three hags around a fire, of ugliness unseen
In a grim and murky mire
From a cauldron rises steam
Murmuring weird rhymes into the winter night
Their laughter barks and chimes
Their reeky breath's a blight

Their noses stir the brew, the nauseating stew

Cauldron bubble, cauldron swell
In the rhythm of this spell
Wing of bat and leg of toad
A brat shall be bestowed

A witch is born
A witch is born
Cauldron-born
A witch is born tonight

A witch is born
A witch is born tonight

A penetrating yell, a savage infant cry
The priest strikes the death
Knell in the village nigh
Four hags around a fire in the grim
And murky mire

Cauldron bubble, cauldron swell
In the rhythm of this spell
Wing of bat and leg of toad
A brat shall be bestowed

A witch is born
A witch is born
Cauldron-born
A witch is born tonight

A witch is born
A witch is born tonight
