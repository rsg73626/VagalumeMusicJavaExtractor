THE FRAGRANCY OF SOIL UNEARTHED

Moonrise, at last
Sufferer, join the enigma
Nightfall, the call
Ponderer unto the omega

In the truthful light of this starlit hall
I am yet to fall!

Until the stars die, until the fate
Until the end's nigh
And all the hollow mirth is spent
Until the sun fails, until the worm
Until the earth hails
Until my body shall descent

Here I am king!
Here I am truth alone

Star-dome extend!
Wanderer into night transcend
When silence then encompasses all
I am yet to fall!

Here I am king!
Here I am truth alone

Fall, fall!
Light is gone
Fall and fall!
O' dying sun

Fall, fall!
Light is gone
Fall and fall!
O' dying sun

Darkness, be my guest!
When all the hollow noise
The soundless shrieks
And senseless words are gone

Gazing up into the stars
Into velvet crimson skies
Conducting from the earth
The great orchestra of silence
