EVIL IS OF OLD DATE

From the ice od the poles
to the dry lands in the south
it was written on old scrolls
or has been spread by word of mouth.
In the forests of the old world
it crawled among the mist
and in the desert dunes
its legends could persist.

Evil is of old date,
you should learn.
To set ablaze its fire...
Let it burn!

Evil is of old date,
let us praise.
Its glaring myth
we set ablaze!

In primordial bogs and mires
it dwelled without a form
but still it is far older
it's the dark's firstborn.
What to some is evil
to others is a strive
for glory, inspiration - our impetus
of life.

Evil is of old date,
you should learn.
To set ablaze its fire...
Let it burn!

Evil is of old date,
let us praise.
Its glaring myth
we set ablaze!
