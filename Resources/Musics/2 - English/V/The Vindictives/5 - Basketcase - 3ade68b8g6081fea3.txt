BASKETCASE

Gadget gadget gotta get that little gadget, I had one once I really knew it well, can't remember where I was when I last had it but if I did I'd never tell. Basketcase, she left me hypnotized basketcase, she left me crucified basketcase, she left me stupefied basketcase, That little plastic thing was in my pocket, it's sitting right next to the phone, it broke in pieces cause I always dropped it, I feel like I got broken bones, I watched my next door neighbor through my window, she dropped a pink thing on my lawn, she used to work the winos at the peepshow, I went to pick it up at dawn.
