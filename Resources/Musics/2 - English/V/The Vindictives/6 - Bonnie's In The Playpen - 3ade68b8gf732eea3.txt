BONNIE'S IN THE PLAYPEN

Bonnie's in the playpen thinkin of her weekend, wonderin, ponderin, wonderin, ponderin, why time flies time flies when you're havin fun. 
Bonnie's in the playpen thinkin up a reason, wonderin, ponderin, wonderin, ponderin, why she cannot work at all next week. 
Bonnie's in the playpen blaming me to no end, raggin and naggin and raggin, and naggin, about her job, her life, and her selfish friends. 
She's a whippin sand in my face and said that I'm a disgrace she's working hard these days she'll never change her ways but that doesn't give her the right to start up a fight so Get up! Get out! 
Bonnie's in the playpen plotting out her revenge thinking of ways and thinking of ways to get time off her job to kick my ass
