YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE

I can see your wishy-washy heads bob up and down, you'll never deny it cause you know what I'm talking about, just passing thru til you start growing up, and when you sing along it's just like getting drunk. you block everything everything everything out you lost everything everything everything now. 
Well you deny the things you say you think you do but you're probably wrong it's just a phase that you're going thru, and in a coupla years when you're screaming at your own little kids, I hope these words come back and kick you in the head. You know who you are and you know what I'm talking about, You know who you are and you know what I'm talking about.
