LA-LA LAND

I think that I lost my mind today today, it shriveled up and flew away, I think I'm thinking too much stinking thinking, I thought I'd think it all away. Dreaming scary scary things all night, I was a naked baby on a plastic plate staring people aimed their eyes through me and now I am feeling very very out of place. 
Sometimes sometimes sometimes reaching out from far away, someday someday someday, I will return to la-la land. I think I mentioned something carelessly, you misunderstood something I said, I wish I could erase this conversation, lying wide awake alone in bed. Left me rearranging changing programs changing now I'm only scared of everything bomiting up doctrine traps that I've been fed, my head is spinning winding circles in my head
