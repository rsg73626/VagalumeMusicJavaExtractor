UGLY AMERICAN

When I do my job I do it well. if you want blood just ring Ma Bell. Don't talk to me man I've got a gun, and I don't quite until I'm done. I've only just begun, we'll storm the stadium, will you let me in, coach? It's just another game show. 
Oh, I am the ugly american, stop me before i kill again. Oh, I am the ugly american, stop me before i kill myself. 
Let me go down with the boys that get to play with all the toys. I'll man these gates and save the farm, cause every fool is someone's star. We're ignorant and blind, my shoes are nicely shined, and i know i can save my sould, somewhere over the rainbow. 
Oh, I am the ugly american, stop me before I kill again. Oh, I am the ugly american, stop my before I kill myself.
