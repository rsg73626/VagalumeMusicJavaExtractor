APT. #2

The people upstairs are comin through the ceiling, the people downstairs are always at home. The people upstairs are screamin when I'm sleeping and the people downstairs are always alone. I'm living in misery, i miss my mom and daddy. I never get any sleep, cause the people downstairs are living in a dreamland but the people upstairs won't leave me alone. 
The people upstairs are laughing after midnight, the people downstairs never answer the phone. The people upstairs are doing something crazy, and the people downstairs are staying at home. I'm living in misery, i miss my mom and daddy. I never get no sleep, cause the people downstairs are living in a dreamland but the people upstairs won't leave me alone.
