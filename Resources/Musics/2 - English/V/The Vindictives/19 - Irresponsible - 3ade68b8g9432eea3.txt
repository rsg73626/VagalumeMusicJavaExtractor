IRRESPONSIBLE

Call me irresponsible, call me unreliable, throw in undependable too. Do my foolish alibis bore you? Well, I'm not too clever. I just adore you. Call me unpredictable, tell me I'm impractical, rainbows I'm inclined to pursue. 
Call me irresponsible, yes I'm unreliable, but it's undeniably true I'm irresponsibly mad for you. Call me irresponsible, yes, I'm unreliable, but it's undeniably true I'm irresponsibly mad for you.
