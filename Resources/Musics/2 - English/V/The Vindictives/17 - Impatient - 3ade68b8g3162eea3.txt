IMPATIENT

I'm really getting sick of hesitating can't sit and wait for everything to change, now I don't know where the hell I'm going but it's gonna be a lot better than where I've been. 
Now I don't know where I'm runnin to or where I'm comming from, Now I don't care I'll run you over to get from here to get to there. Don't take this personally I know you disagree get the fuck out of my way, I mean this seriously you better listen to me I'm free today.
