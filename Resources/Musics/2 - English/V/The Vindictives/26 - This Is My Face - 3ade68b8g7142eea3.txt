THIS IS MY FACE

Don't try to make me smile, feel like shit with me for a while, take a little break. So what if I act like a child, let me crawl to you tonight, cause I'm not gonna stay. Right now I'm feeling okay, but tomorrow is another day, and another face. I'm not sure what is a something but I know that's not what I'm going to be, can't I be replaced. I stay up late every night, to think up ways to do things right, I wanna have it both ways. 
I get confused about social rules, so i slip between the little holes and that's what i like. What happened to your face, what the fuck did they do to your face. Just take a look at your face, is that your other face, or is it the one that you misplaced, what happened to your face? Take a real good luck at my face, take a long hard look at my face, cause this is my face, this is my face, this is my face, cause this is my face, yeah.
