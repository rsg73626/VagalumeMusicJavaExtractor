DEADLINE

There is hope between the desperate and love 
Behind a fight we're running round and round in circles 
We see the light, coming up around the corner 
But we do not tend to trust and think it over when we satisfy 
Our selves... 

Take my hand, wash it clean, so much to uncover 
And let's be honest cause there's a lot of things we can give 
Out of prosperity, and love will see right through you 

Travelling the world I've never seen 
So much beauty 
But a lot of violence too 
Somewhere there's a better place 
For all of us to hide 
Don't say: it's too late... 

Take my hand, wash it clean, so much to uncover 
And let's be honest 
Cause there's a lot of things we can give out of prosperity 
And love will see right through you 

Take my hand, wash it clean, so much to uncover 
And let's be honest 
Cause there's a lot of things we can give out of charity 
And love will see right through you 

Take my hand, wash it clean, 
So much to be uncovered... today!
