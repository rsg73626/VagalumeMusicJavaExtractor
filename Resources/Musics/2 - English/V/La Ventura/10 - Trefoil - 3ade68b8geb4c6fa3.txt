TREFOIL

Quietly, we were drawn in here
Through our eagerness inside, all lies
What we fear is our destiny 
Getting closer while we breath, some will die

refr
Purify the water, we'll need
Something less contagious
Something else to take it over

Purify the air, let us breath
Something less contagious
Something else to take it over

Try to see, we have lost our lives
Many shadows on our path, we wont survive
All we reach for is an empty grail
That will never be filled enough with grace

refr
Purify the water, we'll need
Something less contagious
Something else to take it over

Break away the wall, let us reach
Something less depressive
Something more progressive over here


I will not fade, I will not break
I will not fade, I will not break
