ONLY LOVE WILL FIND ITS WAY

Hollow streets all clear the way one by one 
The porter watches at the gate as they run 
You're so cold but you keep your hand in mine 
Close your eyes and dream one last time if... 

Only love will find it's way 
Only love will find it's way, when we turn it over 
Only love will find it's way, only love will never
break 
When we turn it over 

Hollow eyes, all red and gray, don't you cry 
Break the bitterness inside it is wrong 
You're so cold let me feel your hand in mine 
Lay your head on me one last time if... 

Only love will find it's way 
Only love will find it's way, when we turn it over 
Only love will find it's way, only love will never
break 
When we turn it over
