CRY

Do you remember? Time stood still... 
I can't forget about the past how we turned it all away 
I am aware now, that love is gone 
Don't think I'll be strong enough to cope on my own 

Try to forget: I'm waiting...for you 
Don't you forget: I'll make it...without you! 

Can you imagine? If time stood still... 
I guess we both had our reasons to leave this love for good 
Our hands were tied and what's done is done 
My feet will be strong enough to carry me home 

Try to forget: I'm waiting...for you 
Don't you forget: I'll make it...without you! 

When I close my eyes 
I can see all the memories inside 
How we fancied each other 
And we danced the night away 
Let me cry!!!
