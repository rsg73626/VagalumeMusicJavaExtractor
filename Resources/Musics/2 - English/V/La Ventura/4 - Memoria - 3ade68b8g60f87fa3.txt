MEMORIA

Hearing the songs that we used to play 
Reminds me of you again 
You painted my world so colourful. 
The thoughts and feelings that we shared 
Were so open 

All those days they are gone 
And you're but my memory 
All my wounds they are gone 
And life has turned out, beautiful, beautiful now 

Long conversations on the couch 
Or in the freezing cold 
It felt so much more then just good friends. 
Do you remember it the same way 
As I do? 

All those days they are gone 
And you're but my memory 
All my wounds they are gone 
And life has turned out 
Beautiful, beautiful now 

Oh...you are my memory! 

All those days they are gone 
And you're but my memory 
All my wounds they are gone 
And life has turned out, beautiful, beautiful now 

All those days... All of those days.... 
They are gone 
And you're nothing but memories, memories now
