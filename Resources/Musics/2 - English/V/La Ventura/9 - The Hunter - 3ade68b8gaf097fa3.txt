THE HUNTER

Look out here she comes, will she find you? 
Breathe my love I'm waiting... 
'till I touch you...inside 

Watch out where you go, she might be hunting 
There's no time to hide away: You've gone... 
Slowly insane! 

You don't want to fall 
But when it comes along 
It doesn't get us all 
I warn you ! 
When it makes you fall 
It will unlight you 
And when it takes control 
You've died too! 

Listen to her noiseless words, unspoken 
Dream my dear I'm waiting 
To embrace you...with love 

Move your feet don't hesitate 
You must keep running 
Feel no fear when she's coming in 
To take...over your brain! 

You don't want to 
You don't want to 
You don't want to fall!
