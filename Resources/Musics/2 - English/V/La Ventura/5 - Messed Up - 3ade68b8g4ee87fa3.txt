MESSED UP

I'm breaking...I'm breaking down... 
The sound of silence, is driving me insane 
Borders are fading, between sanity and sane. 
What is going on? What is my goal? 
Why can't I keep holding on? 

Memories so painful 
It's better to leave them alone 
Before it's breaking me up 
Before it's turning me down 
I can not hold it much longer 
Be stronger! 

Breaking down, falling down 
Broken, but still standing tall 

Nothing can stop me from falling 
I feel messed up in my head, 
Trying so hard to avoid it 
But I can't break out, no I can't break out of here. 

These scary voices, are welling up inside 
My hands are shacking, it's just a matter of time 
Before it's breaking me up 
Before it?s turning me down 
I can not hold it much longer 
Be stronger! 

Nothing can stop me from falling 
All these feelings in my head, 
I've tried so hard to avoid it 
But I can't beak out 
No I can't break out of here...
