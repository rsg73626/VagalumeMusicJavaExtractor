A NEW BEGINNING

There's no one who's honest 
None who's wise 
We all turned away our heads 
And we all got our pride. 
There's no one who's blameless 
None without lies 
We all speak, words to wound the heart 
And it cuts me like a knife... 
...These are findings, these are my findings! 

So would you please forgive me, forgive me.. 
...This can't go on 
There'll be a new beginning, beginning, beginning 
For the rest of our lives 

[There's] No one without sin 
No one lives in peace, 
We all are quick to hurt and kill 
And ruin what we leave... 

Why, so self-centred? None, not even one 
Would give away, his only son. 

So would you please forgive me, forgive me, forgive me 
This can't go on! 
There'll be a new beginning, beginning, beginning 
For the rest of our lives!
