RIGHT & RIGHTEOUS

On fields of fear they have grown 
Learned to love and cry 
Inhaled the air of dust and grief 
So lost and paralysed... 
''I hope you'll find your right 
I hope you'll find righteousness'' 
If we know the truth, let's not compromise it 
And if we feel confused, let us find a way to justify!


Come out of your shelters, into the crowd 
And raise your voices loud and clear 
For all to hear... 
''I hope you'll find your right 
I hope you'll find righteousness'' 
If we know the truth let's not compromise it 
And if we feel abused, let us find a way to justify! 
If we know the truth let's not compromise it 
And if we feel confused, let us find a way to justify!


Let's find right, your right and righteousness 
Your right, your right and righteousness
