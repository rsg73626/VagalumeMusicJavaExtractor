REMIND YOU

Hear me, 
I ask you to be silent and don?t interfere 
Cause I, I remind you... 
Old grieve, have become a bigger part of me 
Then I really want, I, I would remind you 
Behold, the truth is lying here in front of you 
To be told, and I will not give you sympathy! 

I, I could deny all this 
Run from it, saving my breath 
Cause oh, we?ve fallen deep. 
I, I would advice you to 
Finally, show your regret 
Cause we?ve fallen too deep. 

Fear me, 
My rage it?s grown stronger than it was 
I, I would remind you 
I think, 
I swallowed your pride 
And your lies to long 
I, I would remind you. 

Behold! 
The truth is lying here in front of you 
To be told, and I will not give you sympathy!
