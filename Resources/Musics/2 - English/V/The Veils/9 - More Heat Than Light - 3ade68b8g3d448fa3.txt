MORE HEAT THAN LIGHT

The imperial disaster's 
In a furious decline
They've been burning down the ghettos, burning down the ghettos 
crossing all of the lines
And everyone gets so excited 
As it all starts ti rise
All the time the time radiating
More heat than light
More heat than light

They've been spitting on the mirage 
In the back of the van
If he can do it, if he can do it, if he can do it
I think anybody can 
They've been polishing the dolphin 
You've never seen a beast so bright 
All the time the time radiating
More heat than light
More heat than light

All you funny little men 
With that fever in your eyes
You say put them with the others, put them with the others 
You should never analyse
He fucked the watermelon women 
Like thief in the night
All the time the time radiating
More heat than light
More heat than light
