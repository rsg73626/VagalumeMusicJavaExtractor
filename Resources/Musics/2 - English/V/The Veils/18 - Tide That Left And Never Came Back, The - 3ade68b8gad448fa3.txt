TIDE THAT LEFT AND NEVER CAME BACK, THE

I'm sick from the city
It burns in my side
The ships that are leaving
Shine so bright in the night time

And though the memories fade
It's still ou that I find
If only you could stay 
And not leave me behind

The tide that left and never came 
Is on my mind tonight
Such a small town 
And it misses you, my love

Don't fall into all
Those sad stories you write
Your voice is so pretty 
When it gets caught in the right rhyme

And though the memories fade
It's still ou that I find
If only you could stay 
And not leave me behind

The tide that left and never came 
Is on my mind tonight
Such a small town 
And it misses you, my love
