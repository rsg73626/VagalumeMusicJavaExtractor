GUIDING LIGHT

I'm fine from within
Just better without
This noose around my neck
Is counting me out

Wherever I run
My beautiful sin
Is calling outside
And it's that that reminds me of you

Now every last effort tried
So far has been denied
It's easy to cry for love
Far harder to try

There goes my guiding light
Farewell my guiding light
There goes my guiding light

I fought my way in
Can't find a way out
This weightless regret
Surrounding me now

And whenever I run
My beautiful sin
Is calling outside
And it's that that reminds me of you

Now every last effort tried
So far has been denied
It's easy to cry for love
Far harder to try

There goes my guiding light
Farewell my guiding light
There goes my guiding light
Farewell my guiding light
There goes my guiding light
There goes my guiding light
There goes my guiding light
