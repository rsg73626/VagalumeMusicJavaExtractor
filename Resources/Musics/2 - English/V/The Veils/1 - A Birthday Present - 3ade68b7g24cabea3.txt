A BIRTHDAY PRESENT

Everybody think's it's something real
Right until the devil drinks it
O li O
Everything's fate and spinning wheels
Everybody wants their princes

No sense in waiting for a swift completion to come
That invitation is all I'm waiting on

The tedious thoughts of the head of state
Are seldom ever worth revealing
O li O
Indelible stains on the human race
You hideous fakes and murderers!

No sense in waiting for a swift completion that never comes
That invitation is all I'm waiting on

Everybody thinks the end is near
How sm I to tell the difference?
O li O
Wish everybody a happy new year
There are varying results predicted

No sense in waiting for a swift completion to come
That invitation is all I'm waiting on
