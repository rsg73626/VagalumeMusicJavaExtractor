THE TIDE THAT LEFT AND NEVER CAME BACK

I'm sick from the city
It burns in my side
The ships that are leaving
Shine so bright in the nightime

And though my memory's fading
It's still you that I find
If only you could stay and,
Not leave me behind

The tide that left and never came back
Is on my mind tonight
'Cause it's a small town
And it misses you my love

The tide that left and never came back
Is on my mind tonight
'Cause it's a small town
And it misses you my love

Don't fall into all
Those sad stories you write
Your voice is so pretty
When it gets caught in the right rhyme

And though memories fade 
It's still you I find
If only you could stay and,
Not leave me behind

The tide that left and never came back
Is on my mind tonight
'Cause it's a small town 
And it misses you my love

The tide that left and never came back
Is on my mind tonight 
'Cause it's a small town
And it misses you my love

It's a small, dead, broken town
And it misses you my love
