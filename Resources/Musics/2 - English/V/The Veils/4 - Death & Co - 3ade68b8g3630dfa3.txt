DEATH & CO

Oh hear me out
Hear me out inside
Oh I've been running for miles
I've been running for miles and I
I feel divine in my new lease on life
Oh I'm 16 stone, I'm 16 stone and I'm

Oh now here it comes
Here it comes again
The cry left to see
I just wanna let you know
I'm only gonna let you down

Oh I'm burning out
Burning out in style
Let me Hear both sides
Hear both sides 'cause I
I do better without
No with else inside
'cause you're always on show
Working for Death & Co

And hear it comes
Hear it comes again
The cry when I was left to die
An' I just wanna let you know
That I`m only gonna let you down
An' I just wanna let you know
That I`m only gonna let you down
An' I just wanna let you alone
But only I'm only gonna let you down.
