THE NOWHERE MAN

I wonder where the junkies go to die
Were you a friend our just some passer by
Because lately it feels like I might need some time

If you want me then you've found me
With time out of mind

Lately I've wondered how many eyes there are in mine
Because if this aint real then what's the point in trying
And lately it feels like I might need some time

If you want me then you've found me
With time out of mind

Darling I wonder how many signs you'll find tonight
That we all know it's the longest ties that bind
And still lately it feels like I might need some time

If you want me then you've found me
With time out of mind

Im the nowhere man
And I'm nowhere now but where I stand

If you want me then you've found me
With time out of mind
