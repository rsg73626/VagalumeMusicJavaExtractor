NIGHT THOUGHTS OF A TIRED SURGEON

I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real

Take the scalpel, Miss Ivonne
Time of death is 1 am
The blood is going to my head,
By God, I’ll never touch another’s heart again

I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real
I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real

Pass that ashtray, Miss Ivonne
I’m gonna stick it into his ear
Let’s dance the night away in peace my love
Come in we’ll flee like hounds in search of something [lessen sincere](?)

I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real
I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real

But this is all I’ve ever known
No one does it like I do
There must be something in my blood
‘Cause all I know right now is that I love you still

I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real
I’ve been brought back to life so many times I don’t know what’s real
