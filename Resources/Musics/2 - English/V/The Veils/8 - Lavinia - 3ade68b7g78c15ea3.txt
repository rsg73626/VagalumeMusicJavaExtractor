LAVINIA

See my love is asleep on the floor
In a pose that's familiar
See my sun will just send you to war
If the battle don't kill you

But I've changed in mind
She's calling all the time

That I don't want to live in your side
Though the rose is vermillion
And I find it so hard to survive
Witout when within you

My sweet Lavinia
My sweet Lavinia

All the years buried under the floors
And the wounds in the parlour
Would have come up to greet us before
If it weren't for my heart because

I've her name in mine
And it's calling all the time

For my sweet Lavinia....
