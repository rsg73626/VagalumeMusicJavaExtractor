RIDE THE WAVE

Ride the Wave
(by S. DeVicente)

(Wake up! Wake up, everybody! Wake up! 'Cause I'm gonna preach!)

Ride the Wave

God is love
God is faith
God is peace
Gos is is everything you're looking for

Be yourself
Look at you!
Always lying toll the truth

Be victorious
Be a Man
Be a king
Meet - Your death!

Be yourself
Be the best
Be yourself
But be - The rest

Ride the Wave

Into an ocean - of loneliness
into a sky - of pure romance

Ride the Wave
