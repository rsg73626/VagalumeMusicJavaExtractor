THE GODDNESS OF LOVE

The Goddness of Love
(by S. DeVicente)

She's the goddness of love
The goddness of love

She's got me going
All night long
She's got me flowing
And feeling strong
She's got the power
To ge me high
She will devour
Oh my, oh my!

She's the goddness of love
The goddness of love

She likes to - Be in control
She likes to - Make her patrol
She likes to - Rock n'roll!

(Take it, Baby)

She likes to - Manipulate
She likes to - Be the girl you hate
She likes to - Hallucinate

(Hmmm - Oh yeah!)

She's got the moves, the moves, the moves...
And she's so hot, so hot, so hot...

That she can't stop!

She's the goddness of love
The goddness of love
