MOMMA'S BOY

Momma's Boy
(by S. DeVicente)

Baby, you're a momma's boy
Baby, eat your chips-ahoy
Baby, hates his favorite toy
Oh baby, baby - you'r but a short playboy
Life is a party
I wanna have fun
Bring me the moon
Reach for the sun!
Where are the girls?
Where are the boys?
Hey, hey, hey - where are my toys!

Baby, you're always drooling
Baby, quit the fooling
Give me your joy!
(c'mon, c'mon!)
You're a momma's boy!
Mamma's boy
(mamma's boy)
Mamma
(give me your joy)
Mamma!

(Hey, Mommas'boy - Look this way...)
