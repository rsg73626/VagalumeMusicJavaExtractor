MOMENT?

Moment?
(by S. DeVicente)

If a moment could last forever
And inf forever wasn't enought
Which moment would you endeavor?
Endeavor into the rough

The smile on a baby's face
The tear in the lover's eye
The race
A Sigh
Witch way?
And Why?

A horse - Once broke my back
A Girl - Once broke my heart
The momnt of his attack
Nothing ever goes that far

"Romeo and Juliet"
"Love me Tender"
"Heart to Heart"
"Love is All" - "Will Never Part"

The moment that I first saw you
Standing under the light
What can I do?
Right, so right, so right...

The moment that he was born
The moment that she died
The moment that I was torn
The moment that you lied!
