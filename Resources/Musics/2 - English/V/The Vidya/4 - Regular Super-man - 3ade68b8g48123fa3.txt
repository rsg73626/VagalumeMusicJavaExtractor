REGULAR SUPER-MAN

Pills - can help me rock
Grass - can get me high
Coke - oh, what a shock!
Baby, i'm gonna die
Please let me try

I'm just a regular super-man

No turning back
No loving back
No "to" and "fro"
No way to go
There's no
Let's go!

Super-man

Oh, baby!
Am i still alive?
Am i all alone?
Is life just a ride?
Is death down the road?

Is death down?

Oh, baby!
I'm just a regular super-man
