HORSE POWER

Horse Power
(by S. DeVicente)

First there was a short one
The lottle on was shy
After came an Arab
Who wouldn't let you try
Then I met my friend
My partner in the crime
Together we were invencible
Our loops made us sublime!

Horse Power

I Got!

I took a breath
And let my buddy go
He knew wat he was doing
He kept his ears low
We let time surpass us
All the way up to that turn
Where we broke the laws of gravity
Stole the gold - and miled firm!

Horse Power

I Got!

I can cross the green of fields
I can jump over the rainbow
I can steer when i yield
I can touch you
I can feel you
I can - love you

My Siroco

Horse Power

I Got!

Don't even try to catch me
Don't waste your precious time
I'm sitiing on the wind
And I am just about to fly - Roll it please!

No point in shedding tears
Nor hiding in a lie
This boy's got some "Horse Power"
To fly up to the sky
So fly up to the sky
Horse Power!
Fly me high!

Horse Power

I Got!
