CRIMINAL RAZON

You took off the freedom of me
In the arrest thinks about something
For here to finish with its cursed
No life to leave remain nothing

Escaping of the jail
Walking and robbery a car
The destination already is tracing
Drink all whisky in the jar

Who took me six years
Of happiness and tears

No life, no more robber
Today i kill your mother
