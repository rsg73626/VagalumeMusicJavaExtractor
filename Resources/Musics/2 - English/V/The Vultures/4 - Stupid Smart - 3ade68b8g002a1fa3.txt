STUPID SMART

I want your love, baby
And you don't give me
I sold my soul for you
And you are n'o't here

You are girl very smart
But you don't give your heart
Now cry for rivers blood
Begging for who if it was

Stupid Smart

Stupid Smart
Don't give your heart

Now valley not to cry
Wou will live alone to die
In hell you will to burn
This lesson you to learn
