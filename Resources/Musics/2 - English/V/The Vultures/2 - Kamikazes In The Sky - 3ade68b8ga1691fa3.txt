KAMIKAZES IN THE SKY

Night was in that they appeared
With its flags red and white
Tearing night with its airplanes
Spreading the death coming of the sky

No matter how hard they were hidden
No matter how hard they ran away
In night the death was certain
Because they peace did not have

Hamornized it frightened
They were the kamikazes in the sky

The group was feared in the city
For the mark that they took skull
She smiling for you life
Renamed Banzay

The mark of the war is there
If it extends until today
The people remembers and fears
The Banzays that had taken the tears
