SOMETHING IN THE AIR

Come on and tell me the earth
Come on and tell me bout the atmosphere
Oh babe
Come on and tell me bout the things that are caught
In between all the thoughts that you're thinking
Come on and tell me bout your hopes
Your dreams
The plug that keeps your ship from sinking

And do you believe
In fairy tales?

Because there's something in the air
But I don't know what
I don't know what it is
But it feels like
The birds out back are singing lullabies
OOh
OOh

Tell me bout the earth, the trees, the flowers, and the bees
And the parts they are wonderful
We're coming up, down, pass me around
I don't know where I'm goin'
Traveled this world so far
So far now, I've been on this road so long, long, long

And do you believe
In fairy tales?

Because there's something in the air
But I don't know what
I don't know what it is
But it feels like
The birds out back are singing lullabies
Something in the air
But I don't know what
I don't know what it is
But it feels like
It feels like singing

We started sining but our songs were all for nothing cause
Nobody cared
If we were meant for something beautiful
If you could hear the sound of all this now
You would feel the same

Can you hear them
OOh
Can you hear them sing
OOh
Listen up listen up now
OOh
Can you hear them sing
OOh

Because there's something in the air
But I don't know what
I don't know what it is
But it feels like
The birds out back are singing lullabies
Something in the air
But I don't know what
I don't know what it is
But it feels like
It feels like singing

OOh
It feels like singing, singing
OOh
And I don't know what
OOh
I just don't know what
OOh
Because there's something
OOh
Do you know that something
OOh
Something in the air
OOh
Something, something in the air
