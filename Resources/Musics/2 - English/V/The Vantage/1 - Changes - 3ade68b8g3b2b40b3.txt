CHANGES

I'm putting out fires
I set in my heart
Taking too much from the start
Left behind the darkest scars
And that's all I can say
I turned around and walked away
A burnout on love
Taking it from the glove
Cause it's you that I wanna hold
And it's you that's making me cold oh well

I'm always looking out the window
I'm always running up the wall
I got to get back to the place that I belong
I'm always searching after you
Oh tell me girl where have you gone?
And why would you wanna leave me on my own?
Cause it's hard enough to walk this world alone - yeah
And the part saddest part
is knowing she's not coming home

Been watching the cars go by after all these years
And I lost my mind for reasons that I couldn't explain
To you, there lost on me
We've all made mistakes
but it's time we make these changes

I'm caught at the wheel
never sure of how I should feel
Been making the change
I'm pulling my heart from the pencil to the page
OO oo throwing your love to the wind again how does it feel
OO oo knowing that you never mattered
Mattered mattered AT ALL!

I've been watching the cars go by after all these years
And I lost my mind for reasons that I couldn't explain
To you, there lost on me
We've all made mistakes
but it's time we make these changes

CH CH CHA CHANGES CHA CHA CHA CHANGES
CHA CHA CHA CHANGES CHA CHA CHAGES
ALL THESE CHAnGES FROM THE HEART (OO)

She came down
I lost my head again about it
I've been caught in the clouds for all these days
It's been a long long time
since you've been by the old surroundings
there's nothing left for me to say
Can you fix me up baby, can you tell me
I'm the one, or will you take me as you want
until all of my parts are gone?
And could you fix me up baby, put my heart back in
take a listen to your spirit and the souls
you've been walking in OH
Would you fix me up baby
put my heart back in
it feels like I've been waiting for been waiting for the walls
to fall around me, around me they will fall
