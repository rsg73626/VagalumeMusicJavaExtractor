CHASING AFTER YOU

She shines like a diamond; cuts like a blade
She's made up of the finer things
And it's too bad, too late
I gave you my love and you gave it away
And I'm all played out
Like the cards from the poker man he dealt them well
She's calling your bluff
now you've gone off and you just don't know at all

Is this love just a game for fools
Cause when I get lonely, that's when I get reckless now
Just chasing after you
Is this love just a game for fools, a game for fools
I get lonely that's when I get desperate
Chasing after you

Let's suppose I'm the guilty one
Let's suppose my hands on the smoking gun
No mirror or curtains to close
I gave you my heart and you're making your holes
And a part of me thinks as I'm having this drink
She's just using this time to build up the belief that
She can have anything that she wants
As long as she keeps my heart on empty

Is this love just a game for fools
Cause when I get lonely, that's when I get desperate now
Chasing after you
Is this love just a game for fools
a game for fools I get lonely that? s when I get reckless now
Just chasing after, just chasing after you

She shines like a diamond; cuts like a blade
She's made up of the finer things

Is this love just a game for fools
Cause when I get lonely, that's when I get reckless now
Just chasing after you
Is this love just a game for fools, a game for fools
I get lonely that's when I get desperate
Chasing after you
