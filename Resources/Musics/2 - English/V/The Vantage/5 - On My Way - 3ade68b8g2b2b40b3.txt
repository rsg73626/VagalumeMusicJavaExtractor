ON MY WAY

I'm taking it all back now
And every word I've ever spoken aloud
Is gone and I'm moving on
I'm moving past these walls
Towards the beauty and the battle of it all

Don't it make you wonder
Do we stand
For what we need?
Or are we too busy chasing everything?

I don't know
I think that we should go and get away
I think that the time has come to change
To pull ourselves up off the floor

Heartbeat
Motivation
Symphony
I am on my way
(Way oh way I'm on my oh way oh way I'm on my my)

And when it all comes down
You'll be the one that you believe in
Like the turning of the seasons
You'll come around

We're burning like the sun
We are, we are
Higher than the stars
We know we are

When we finally find our way
We'll see all the things we're missing

Heartbeat
Motivation
Symphony
I am on my way
(Way oh way I'm on my oh way oh way I'm on my my)

And I know it's hard to see through
These days they never end
Then again
There could be so much more

We can't take it
Time won't wait for us
To see what we become
Can you feel us moving on?
(Moving on)

(Hey oh, hey)

Heartbeat
Motivation
Symphony
I am on my way
Motivation
Symphony
I am on my way
(Way oh way I'm on my oh way oh way I'm on my my x3)
