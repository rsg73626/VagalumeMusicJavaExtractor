CITY I'M DREAMING OF

And it's not Frankfurt, Paris, Portugal or Mozambique babe
And That's not where I found her love - my sweet love
She grew up someplace in between the beach
in a hundred miles east of
The Gulf of Mexico

Cause She's been living in the city that I'm dreaming of
Early in the morning
You know that that's when she's getting up, when the day begins

Come fly with me we'll sail around the world oo-yeah
Never ever gonna let you go
Never ever gonna let you go
If I really knew what you've been dreaming
It's hard believing
I'm never ever gonna let you go
you'll never know, you'll never know

So here's the part when it all starts spinning around
The morning comes the same without her, without her there
I always find myself slipping, slipping
I'm falling through, falling through the scenery each day

Cause She's been living in the city
that I'm dreaming of
Early in the morning
You know that that's when she's getting up
when the day begins

Come fly with me we'll sail around the world oo-yeah
Never ever gonna let you go
Never ever gonna let you go
If I really knew what you've been dreaming
It's hard believing
I'm never ever gonna let you go

And it's not Frankfurt, Paris, Portugal or Mozambique babe
And That's not where I found her love

Come fly with me
we'll sail around the world oo-yeah
Never ever gonna let you go
Never ever gonna let you go
If I really knew what you've been dreaming
It's hard believing
