FROM THE START

Waking up with stones unturned
The lessons of our life unlearned
Just take a bow for everything you thought you knew now
Cause it's all wrong
but what the hell is right
who has the right to even say at all well
What would you say oh if you had to count the days
since I've been gone fighting in the war
What would you say oh if you had to sail away
knowing I was gone what would you say?

When my train comes in
You look at me right in the eyes
And knew that I had held you in my heart
When I met you darling
I knew that I loved you from the start
OO oo oo
OO oo oo
I loved you from the start

And the hardest part is never knowing
when you're gonna go
When will you be back?
When the work is done that's what I'm told
We could stop the fight if the world could find peace
And we could live our lives
no one else would have to grieve well
When my train comes in
You look at me right in the eyes
And knew that I would hold you in my arms
When I met you darling
I knew that I loved you from the start

When my train comes in we'll be together then
Cause I knew it darling I loved you from the start

OO oo oo
OO oo oo
I loved you from the start
