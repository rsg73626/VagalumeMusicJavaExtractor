LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE

Tell me
Did you get your ticket
Betting on me and when I fall to sickness
So sick that's why I got plan
Waiting on the karma of a cut of man
So lonely
I'm not alone
I've got me
Myself is all I need and I'm not selfish
I'm not greedy
Just the privacy and ones I left behind
Now there just fading pictures in my ever-fading mind

Chorus
Oh, I'll dress up and shine my shoes
So the devil doesn't know
It's me when I come through
A shame that my sins outweigh my virtues
Ran away from the light
When I walked away from you
Please tell me a story or two
That you heard about me
I'll tell you if they're true
No I don't look like what everybody's grown use to
Left my old ways behind when I left you
When I left you

You find me funny
Not just making fun of me
It's not new to me
I get the crazy draws you in
The mad man in the woods committed every single sin
In the book
But never to the letter
Dot my T's and cross my I's
And swear I never met her
A sight for sore eyes
Think I've read too much
But I'm done writing down
Every little such and such

Chorus
Oh, I'll dress up and shine my shoes
So the devil doesn't know
It's me when I come through
A shame that my sins outweigh my virtues
Ran away from the light
When I walked away from you
Please tell me a story or two
That you heard about me
I'll tell you if they're true
No I don't look like what everybody's grown use to
Left my old ways behind when Iâ€¦

Oh when I dress up and shine my shoes
So the devil doesn't know
It's me when I come through
A shame that my sins outweigh my virtues
Ran away from the light
When I walked away from you
Please tell me a story or two
That you heard about me
I'll tell you if they're true
No I don't look like what everybody's grown use to
Left my old ways behind when I left you
When I left you
When I left you
