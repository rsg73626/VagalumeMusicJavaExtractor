OH MISS DECEIVER

Oh Miss Deceiver
Have you found your next victim
Tall dark and handsome
Will you lure him in, will you ever let him go

When will you learn
To defeat your demons with your heavy heart
Cold-blooded murder
Of a man who never stood a chance

(Oh Miss Deceiver) will you ever, ever let him go
(Oh Miss Deceiver) no he never, he never stood a chance
(Oh Miss Deceiver) will you ever, ever let him go
(Oh Miss Deceiver) no he never, he never stood a chance

Oh Miss Deceiver
There's little bit of you in everyone
Some try to hide
But that's a far, far cry from the truth

So caught in your ways
You believe the lies that you tell are true
Never again
Will I let myself give into you

(Oh Miss Deceiver) you're a far, far cry from the truth
(Oh Miss Deceiver) never again will I give into you
(Oh Miss Deceiver) you're a far, far cry from the truth
(Oh Miss Deceiver) never again will I give into you
