WHITE NOISE

The psichos in riot gear
March in my nightmares
I'm over excited
I'm underemployed
I'm gonna get even
Don't give me no reason
I don't need a reason to get bored
Don't make it no big deal
I just couldn't sit still
The wasn't no feeling behind your words
I'm taking my medicine
Just wait 'till it kicks in
I don't need a reason, I'm just bored

It's never enough, it's never enough
It's just my luck, I could live forever
It's never enough, it's never too much
It's never enough, no, it's never ever...

White noise interrupts!
No reception is good enough!
White noise t-turn it up!
I'm disconnected, I'm out of touch!
Don't touch me!

Now who can I blame for this time I've wasted?
There's no one around, but I'm not alone
Just look through the window
Yeah, it's looking through ya
You stand on the edge of a papercut
You talk and I listen
But something is missin'
There wasn't no meaning
Behind your words
There's too much destruction
Making me dizzy
Addiction is easy when you're bored
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough, no, no, never ever...

White noise interrupts!
No reception is good enough!
White noise t-turn it up!
I'm disconnected, I'm out of touch!

White noise interrupts!
No reception is good enough!
White noise t-turn it up!
I'm distracted, I'm out of touch!

I get lost in my head
In my head it's raining
All my friends want me dead
In my head it's raining

White noise interrupts!
No reception is good enough!
White noise t-turn it up!
I'm disconnected, I'm out of touch!

White noise interrupts!
No reception is good enough!
White noise t-turn it up!
I'm distracted, I'm out of touch!
