EVERY LITTLE

You've shut me out
I found your souvenir
Sand penchant, we shoot
We shut up- like that.
A pioneer, a debutante- enemy.
Oh cut me down, or cut me off
How? like that.
And if you stare,
Then you will see.

Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Every little.
Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Yeah, ha ha.

Go, go, go, go.

We headed down.
Past the avenue
I never ever walked on.
While it rained,
And i closed my hands,
My rubber hands.
Round your thin swan neck-
Your brittle wrists
Now- i know!
Eyelids are off,
Eyelids are off.

Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Every little.
Don't say no.
Don't say no.
Don't say no.

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
