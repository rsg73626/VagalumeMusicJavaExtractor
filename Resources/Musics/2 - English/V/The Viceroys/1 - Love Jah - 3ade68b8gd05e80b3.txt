LOVE JAH

Love love
Oh love love
Love Jah
Before it's too late

Thank him for the sun
That shines everyday
Thank him for the rain
When it falls from the sky
Praise him
Thank him for the sea
And the land that we see
There is so much around us
That we should thank im for

Looking at creation
It's so great to see
Jah Jah in his greatness
Makes the birds and the bees
Same as yesterday
Is the same as today
Never never change
Give him praises everyday
