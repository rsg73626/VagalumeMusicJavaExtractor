HOMETOWN ANTHEM

This is for all we talk and the girls that stalk boys
Bad mouthing that we do
Trouble we get into
Our looks could strike a fire that ignites
Good times that never end
We always set the latest trend
The rumors that we start could tear the town apart
Cause we’re never sober
No we’re never sober
And you know so well that we’ll increase the dose
On the very next shot of the very next toast

Shy she stands around
She’s new to town
Sullenly walking
Down casino drive
Where city lights
Shine down and blind her
Just don’t get lost along the way
There’s no chance we wouldn’t take
I won this time!
Somebody wake me…

Tell me tell me that we never had a purpose
Use me use me I know that we deserve this
All the more we try, we fall behind
This is something that we never could imagine
Drivin’ drivin’ hiding from your parents
All the more we try we fall behind
All the more we try, we fall behind
Behind….

Shy she stands around
She’s new to town
Sullenly walking
Down casino drive
Where city lights
Shine down and blind her
Just don’t get lost along the way
There’s no chance we wouldn’t take
I won this time!
Somebody wake me…

And it’s been so much time
Since we said goodbye
To summer nights
And I don’t know about you
But as for me
Had the time of my life
And I hope you did too

Listen to the sound of silence as it’s screaming
All the words I think and that I’ve been dreaming
I believe in this
But it ended so fast cause good things never last
And I know you hate me…
You read my mind and all I wanna say
Ill tell you anything you wanna know
It’s 10 degrees outside Im getting cold
And I’m feeling number than I
Can remember when……

Shy she stands around
She’s new to town
Sullenly walking
Down casino drive
Where city lights
Shine down and blind her
Just don’t get lost along the way
There’s no chance 
We wouldn’t take
I won this time!
Somebody wake me…

And it’s been so much time
Since we said goodbye
To summer nights
And I don’t know about you
But as for me
I had the time of my life.
