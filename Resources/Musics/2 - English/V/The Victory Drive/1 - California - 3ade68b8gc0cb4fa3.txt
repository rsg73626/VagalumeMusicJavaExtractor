CALIFORNIA

Champagne smile and a camera flash
Liquor on her lips in a bubble bath
The finest powder lines
To drug rehab
It’s gonna get a little sad
So hit the west coast if it makes you smile
I guess it’s goodbye for a while
But leaving on all the best of terms
I hope Hollywood will change your world

But hold on, it’s faster than this

I’m calling out to California
I’ll be right here
I hope this’ll do it for ya
I’ll be waitin’ for ya
To be a star out in California

First class style and the latest trend
Desire on her hips and the nervousness
And all the clever lines that you wanna try
Are not working cause I know you’re high-
School was done long ago
But fame’s giving you an ego
Wish you didn’t but I knew you’d change
Now I guess you’re too late to save

Goodbye
You’re a Hollywood Tragedy Show

I’m calling out to California
I’ll be right here
I hope this’ll do it for ya
I’ll be waitin’ for ya
I’m calling out to California
I’ll be right here
I hope this’ll do it for ya
I’ll be waitin’ for ya
To be a star…

Now we’re in overtime
And sudden death is
Sneaking up faster than the words
That roll off of my lips and used to
Get me out of things like this

I’m calling out to California
I’ll be right here
I hope this’ll do it for ya
I’ll be waitin’ for ya
I’m calling out to California
I’ll be right here
I hope this’ll do it for ya
I’ll be waitin’ for ya

So I’m calling out to California

Until you come home from Califonia…
