DEAD MAN'S SHOES

I am the king of conflict, what I want
What I see, never what I need
I'm like a cat and a mouse
Throwing stones from a smashed glass house
Where those freaks don't stop knocking
Another day another enemy
When I'm inside out. I'm inside out

I want you more than happiness
But I need you like the plague
I wear my heart on a broken arm
I'm like a rusty razor blade
I want you more than happiness
So I guess I'll do what I choose
Hey girl lay off my dead man's shoes

I am the king of conflict, digging in to the hole in the market
Standing tall on my hands and knees
Such a fucked up recipe

I want you more than happiness
But I need you like the plague
I'd live alone if I had a home, be lying in this mess I've made
I want you more than happiness
So I guess I'll do what I choose
Hey girl lay off my dead man's shoes

No rest no sleep no peace no life no one no guarantees
No home no job no cash no boss no suit no sign on me
I want you more than happiness
So I guess I'll do what I choose
Hey girl lay off my dead man's shoes
