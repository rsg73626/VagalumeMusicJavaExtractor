EYES WIDE OPEN

Went to see grandpa in september
When his days left here were few
He sat me down at his bedside
Told me things that I should do

Please respect this crown of wisdom,
He said, pointing to his gray head
I leaned in and listened closely
As my dear grandfather said

Live your life with eyes wide open
Bide your time with palms toward heaven
People come in circles and squares
Some are hearts but they're quite rare

Told me stories of his childhood
Of mistakes that he had made
Told me, don't you make the same ones
Because love is not a game.

Live your life with eyes wide open
Bide your time with palms toward heaven
People come in circles and squares
Some are hearts but they're quite rare

I don't want you to be like me,
I want you to be a heart.
But I said, no, grandpa, you're different.
Take a look at what you are.

Grandpa didn't know what a heart he was
When you see him, tell him for me jesus.

Grandpa died with eyes wide open
Grandpa died with palms toward heaven
People come in circles and squares
Some are hearts but they're quite rare
Grandpa was one of these hearts
Take a look at what you are
