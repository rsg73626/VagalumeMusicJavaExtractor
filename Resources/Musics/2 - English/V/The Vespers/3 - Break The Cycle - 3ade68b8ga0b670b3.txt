BREAK THE CYCLE

Everybody sounds like someone else
We all just wanna sound like ourselves
Baby bought a banjo, don't know how to play
Wears it on her shoulders anyway

Break the cycle
What will it take
Beat the system
Give me a break

Everybody looks like someone else
We all just wanna look like ourselves
Brothers got boots, grew a brand new beard
Now he can fit into his atmosphere

Yeah yeah yeah, ain't no room for the same old song
Yeah yeah yeah, too many people keep singing along
Yeah yeah yeah, there's nothing new to do, but we all still try
Yeah yeah yeah, take a deep breath and let it all go by

Everybody thinks like someone else
We all just wanna think for ourselves

Yeah yeah yeah, ain't no room for the same old song
Yeah yeah yeah, too many people keep singing along
Yeah yeah yeah, there's nothing new to do, but we all still try
Yeah yeah yeah, take a deep breath and let it all go by
