TELL YOUR MAMA

If you've never heard a churchbell ring
Then go to the place where the choir sings
And if you've never heard the bible read
Then go to the place where god's word is said

And tell your mama you're following her ways
And you're going to the place where the preacher prays
He prays for you like your mama begged him to

If you've never seen a man baptized
Then go to the place where true love lies
And if you've never seen a good deed done
Then look at the one they called god's son

And tell your mama you're following her ways
And you're going to the place where the preacher prays
He prays for you like your mama begged him to

They're trying to make me lose my mind
Forget what my mama told me
But I will go to that good old church
And the face of the lord I will see

Please tell my mama I'm following her ways
And I'm going to the place where the preacher prays
Tell my mama I'm following her ways
And I'm going to the place where the preacher prays
And I'll be praying for you like the good lord told me to
