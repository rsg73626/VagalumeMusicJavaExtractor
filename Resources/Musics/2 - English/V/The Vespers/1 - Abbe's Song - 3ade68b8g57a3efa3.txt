ABBE'S SONG

Find me a souvenir, you know just what I like
You're going far away you won't give up the fight

And you hold me to what is true and I do the same for you
Without you what will I do
I'll miss you while you're gone for you'll be gone so long

But I can't say. please don't go. oh no
And I'll share you with this world but it hurts

Please try to draw their smiles the same way you've drawn mine
Keep your feet on the path and give love some time

And I'll pray the lord your wounds to heal this doesn't seem quite real
You must know how I feel
I'll miss you while you're gone for you'll be gone so long

But I can't say. please don't go. oh no
And I'll share you with this world but it hurts

But I will see you some day soon (but I will see you some day soon)
But I will see you some day soon (I hope to see you soon)
