NOT SO NICE

It's not so nice when they say, goody-goodies you can't stay.
Not so nice, it's not so nice, not so nice of them to say

And when my baby brother fell
They didn't even stop to help
Not so nice it's not so nice
Not so nice

But even though I have this much to say I'm just like them in my own way
Doo doo doo
I am catching all the yellow lights In my hands and in my mind
Just in time, I'm just in time
Just in time, I'm just in time
Doo doo doo
I'm afraid I might be everything I hate
I'm afraid I might be everything I hate
I'm afraid I might be everything I hate

Now what's the use of preaching to your brother
Acting just like you're his mother
Not so nice, it's not so nice
When you don't take your own advice
Not so nice at all
Not so nice

But even though I have this much to say I'm just like them in my own way
Doo doo doo
I am catching all the yellow lights In my hands and in my mind
Just in time, I'm just in time
Just in time, I'm just in time
Doo doo doo
I'm afraid I might be everything I hate
I'm afraid I might be everything I hate
I'm afraid I might be everything I hate

But I am trying to be nice
Trying hard to compromise
Between my love between my vice
I think I might could be nice
Could be nice I could be nice
Could be nice I could be nice
Could be nice I could be nice
Could be nice I could be nice
