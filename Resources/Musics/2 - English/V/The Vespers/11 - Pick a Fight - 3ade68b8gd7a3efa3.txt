PICK A FIGHT

Rain oh the rain
Pain oh my pain
Tears and rain fall the same

Chains oh my chains
Days these long days
Take me from this place

Running for my life
I will pick a fight
When there's nowhere to run
To my lord I will turn

Son oh my son
Run oh run
They can't catch you with their guns

Your life is yours
It's worth fighting for
Freedom is the door

Running for your life
You will pick a fight
When there's nowhere to run
To your lord you will turn

Running for our lives
We will pick a fight
When there's nowhere to run
To our lord we will turn
