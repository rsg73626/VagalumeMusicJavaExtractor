HIGH HOPES

You are the strongest among people
That live around you, but you don't know it

I hope you never will
I hope you never will

You grow to be the one that you should be
Gallant and selfless, but you don't know it

I hope you never will
I hope you never will

You've been through so much and grow through more still
Brave as a lion, but you don't know it

I hope you never will
I hope you never will

I have no reason for why I say this
For you might hear and might come to know this

I hope you never will
I hope you never will

You might someday see what you are truly
And how I pale in comparison to thee

I hope you never will
I hope you never will

Friend, hold on to me, for I want to see
You become the person you should be

I've always known you will
I've always known you will
