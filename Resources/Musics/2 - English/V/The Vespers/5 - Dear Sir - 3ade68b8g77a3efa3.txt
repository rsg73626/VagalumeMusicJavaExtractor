DEAR SIR

I'll wait for you only
As long as it takes
I'll sing you sweet songs
About how we belong together
And if we don't I'll stay alone forever

You use big words and you don't even try
When you meet someone new you look them in the eye
You gave me your jacket when I wasn't even cold
And you tell me I'll still be pretty even when I'm old

I'll wait for you only
As long as it takes
I'll sing you sweet songs
About how we belong together
And if we don't I'll stay alone forever

If I say the book is good you'll read it in a heartbeat
We'll have long, long, long talks about it and you'll tell me what you think
Your chest is my pillow, you lend me your side to lean on
We'll cloud gaze on a cloudless day, lying on the lawn

And when I finally meet you for the very first time
I'll sing you sweet songs about how we belong
And if you never arrive I'll stay alone forever
