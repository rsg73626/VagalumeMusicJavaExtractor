THE WELL AND THE GRAVESTONE

Here lies the heart of me
Buried with an unmarked gravestone
No name, just the dates it lived and died
Now I want it back

Always finding but never seeing the way
(I want to love again, to love again, once again)
Teach me how not to be afraid
(teach me to love again, to love again, once again)

Take me down and let me see
The well that's full of bravery
And baptize me so I'll be free
To do the things I fear

Always finding but never seeing the way
(I want to love again, to love again, once again)
Teach me how not to be afraid
(teach me to love again, to love again, once again)

Hiding in a filthy hole
With a battered bruised and blistered soul
We will laugh the day I'm whole
And I'll finally see why I used to cry

Always finding but never seeing the way
(I want to love again, to love again, once again)
Teach me how not to be afraid
(teach me to love again, to love again, once again)
Always finding but never seeing the way
(I want to love again, to love again, once again)
Teach me how not to be afraid
(teach me to love again, to love again, once again)
Once again, once again
