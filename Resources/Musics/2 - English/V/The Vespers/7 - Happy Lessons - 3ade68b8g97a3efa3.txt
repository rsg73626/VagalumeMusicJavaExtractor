HAPPY LESSONS

Benedick, I've been wondering how you stay so cheery all the time
Could you teach me, perhaps reach me in this lonely pit of gloom I hide?

Could you give me happy lessons?
Teach the corners of my mouth to smile
I haven't much to give back
But maybe we could hold hands for awhile
If you gave me happy lessons I could mend this broken wall
Hand-in-hand we'd walk along it
To make it last we would stall together

Happy-go-lucky is the key, you say but somehow I still can't see
Where does it come from, could
I get some for less than 5 humble pounds a week?

Could you give me happy lessons?
Teach the corners of my mouth to smile
I haven't much to give back
But maybe we could hold hands for awhile
If you gave me happy lessons I could mend this broken wall
Hand-in-hand we'd walk along it
To make it last we would stall together

Help me to see clearly
I want to be, to be free
Maybe all I have to do
Is let it go, let him take control

Let it go, let him take control
(let me be at peace with myself, let me be at peace)
Let it go, let him take control
(I want to be at peace with myself, let me be at peace)
