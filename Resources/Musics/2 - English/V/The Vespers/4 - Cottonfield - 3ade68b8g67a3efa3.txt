COTTONFIELD

You had a black suit born in the cottonfield
I had a white dress born in the cottonfield
(you had a black suit born in the cottonfield)
Our favorite game was born in the cottonfield
(I had a white dress born in the cottonfield)

We were five when you moved in next door and became my best friend
Found a chest upstairs in the attic with dress-up clothes therein
Much too big

You had a black suit born in the cottonfield
I had a white dress born in the cottonfield
(you had a black suit born in the cottonfield)
Our favorite game was born in the cottonfield
(I had a white dress born in the cottonfield)

Standing in the field all dressed up to play "wedding day"
Every time you would try to kiss me and I would run away
That's all we played

You had a black suit born in the cottonfield
I had a white dress born in the cottonfield
(you had a black suit born in the cottonfield)
Our favorite game was born in the cottonfield
(I had a white dress born in the cottonfield)

All those years I never knew that I would fall in love with you
Practicing for the day the day it wasn't just a game

You had a black suit born in the cottonfield
I had a white dress born in the cottonfield
(you had a black suit born in the cottonfield)
You knelt down on one knee in the cottonfield
(I had a white dress born in the cottonfield)

You had a black suit born in the cottonfield
I had a white dress born in the cottonfield
(you had a black suit born in the cottonfield)
We said our vows both standing in the cottonfield
(we said our vows both standing in the cottonfield)
