MELATONIN RUM

Drawing castles in the sky
Silly geese we've climbed so high
Wearing white my back is turned
With a spiderman band-aid on my burn

Where do they come from? melatonin rum?
Mr sandman? or from heaven?
To our heads

Two linked hands make toddleroos
But gamma rays can make them too
Oh, the taming of the shrew
Have you seen it? no. have you?

Where do they come from? melatonin rum?
Mr. sandman? or from heaven?
To our heads

A pile of feathers here and there
And never a single care
Come and see, found a white sharpie
What a crazy thing to see, dream

Where do they come from? melatonin rum?
Mr. sandman? or from heaven?
Reality
And subconscious meet
In our heads

Dreaming dreams, lots of dreams
Funny dreams, awkward dreams
Scary dreams, dreams that make you cry
Dreams that make you pee in your bed
