SPREAD THE NEWS LIKE A WILDFIRE

I just said it out loud (thank you for the inspiration)
I just said it out loud (thank you for the inspiration)

You helped me figure out what not to be
my moment of reflection and clarity

Thoughts of times when we were young 
gotten me all shaken up 
memories come crashing down
Times a precious gift to me
you took whats mine you'll see
I'll tear your walls down

I'm gonna hold my tongue on this one
(thank you for the inspiration)
Move
I'm gonna hold my tongue on this one
and watch you burn up like a wild fire
