MY DIAGNOSIS

Aww Jobie!  that's the nastiest thang

I'm not a doctor but I'll make a diagnosis
And I'll make an uneducated guess and say she's selfish
Everything is always for you and no one else 
Is your life so important that you live for your self

Come on and get down
Someday the weight of the world will press on your shoulders

How could you play me like that, 
And when you leave I'll be glad 
You've got everything so figured out

So girl you know what its like
Go on think your right
Your wrong, so long
Your so beyond me
