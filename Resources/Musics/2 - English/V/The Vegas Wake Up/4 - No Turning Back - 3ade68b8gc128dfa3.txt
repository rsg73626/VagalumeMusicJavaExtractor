NO TURNING BACK

Never have we held potential in our hands
strong heads and hearts this is where we make our stand

Time is floating away and away
can we seal our fate?

Now that we have built our solid ground
we'll make our stand
we'll make our stand
salvage all that we have left

Everything is going our way, our way
it's all coming together so naturally

If I could find a way to live this life everyday 
I'd pack up all my things and never look back again
I'd leave this town in a heart beat
I've got my friends here beside me

Now that we have built our solid ground

Iv'e got my friends
They've got my back

We'll be the one to see you shot down and ruptured
