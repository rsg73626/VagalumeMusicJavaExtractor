WAVES

I once had the strength to believe I'd 
grow outta this calamity
now I'm passing through hall ways and isle number 4's
hoping your the next girl I see

And these waves crash hard 
as they come rolling it
and I pray one day they will
bring you back me

I'll pour this pestilence into your ear
my dear I'd quote shakespear for 
change his to your and I'll explore 
the simple variations of you

And these waves crash hard 
as they come rolling it
and I pray one day they will
bring you back me

And I'll scream at the top of my lungs
I'll over come anything and everything
