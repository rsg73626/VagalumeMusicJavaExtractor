FIGHT ON

Everything you say is right, and everything I do is wrong.
Don't let these words fall upon deaf ears. You gotta stand up and face your fears.

We're not singing the blues anymore. 
We'll get up and move on like before.
And when our dreams seem so far to the touch.
We'll fight on.
Never give up gonna keep on pushing.

What if everyone around you gives up?
Would you agree and say you've had enough?
Your going to win this fight even if you fight alone. 
Your going to win this fight alone.
