JOIN THE FEAST

I'm warning you, pay attention.
I speak the truth, I've learned my lesson.
Words are nothing more, than deception and lies.
So say good-bye.

I can't believe I'm having the time of my life without you by my side. 

Get low

We'll watch them turn friends to enemies.
Keep your head strong, I've found my remedy. 
Never pay attention to the fakes and liars, 
Good-bye. So say goodbye

And.. There will be blood in the water and the sharks will come to feast on what they've slaughtered. Broken daughters and half wit sons. 

I'm warning you, don't ever look back.
