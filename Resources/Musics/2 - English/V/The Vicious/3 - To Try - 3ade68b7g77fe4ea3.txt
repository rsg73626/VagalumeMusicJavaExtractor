TO TRY

to try to change everything this
to try to change my life 
I tried to change my dreams 
everything what I think on you 

you it did not look at for me when I needed 
I very cried out high for you to hear me 
but I find that this did not advance nothing 
but now this all good 
at least I know that I tried 

I know that this can seem so strange 
but in the deep this it makes some direction 
now everything depends on you 
I tired of these tricks of lie

now it is hour of you to wake up 
to lose all these its fears 
to live a new life to the side of that you attract
