DROP DEAD GORGEOUS

Isn’t crime just fascinating?
The perfect scenery, for our reality show
So here’s the way that it goes,
And how the story begun:
It was the 2 of us.
Just you, me and a gun

So come on, feel the noise
If you want follow my voice
So come on, feel the noise,
We’ll never fall apart

We passed those seconds
As if there was no tomorrow
But the illusion remained, So drop dead!

Drop dead gorgeous
Can’t you see I’m lying?
Get out! Your heart is my battlefield
‘Cause all the things you thought were real
They all become dust.
Don’t you see that everything dies,
But a good lie?

Crime is the only world
Where everything’s possible
Crime is the only world
Where everything’s possible

We passed those seconds
As if there was no tomorrow
But the illusion remained, So drop dead!

Drop dead gorgeous
Can’t you see I’m lying?
Get out! Your heart is my battlefield
‘Cause all the things you thought were real
They all become dust.
Don’t you see that everything dies,
But a good lie?

Everybody all over the world
The world’s coming to an end, so let’s go!
London, Tokyo, New York City
Let’s get out of here, and then kill them

Drop dead gorgeous
Can’t you see I’m lying?
Get out! Your heart is my battlefield
‘Cause all the things you thought were real
They all become dust.
Don’t you see that everything dies,
But a good lie?

Drop dead gorgeous
Can’t you see I’m lying? (2)
