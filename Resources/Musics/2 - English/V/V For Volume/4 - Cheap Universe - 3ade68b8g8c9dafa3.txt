CHEAP UNIVERSE

I always dreamed of being practical... logical
You wanted me married
You wanted me quiet
You wanted me buried so you got a riot

Cheap Universe, Cheap Universe
Cheap Universe, Cheap Universe
Cheap Universe, Cheap Universe
Cheap Universe, Cheap Universe

Go to hell or let me to go to hell alone
Why to we have to go together?
This world is made for those who don't feel at all

Go to hell i would be another girl
If i could but clearly i can't help myself
This is a cheap universe

This world is made for those who don't feel at all
This world is made for those who don't feel at all
This world is made for those who don't feel at all
This world is made for those who don't feel at all

This is a cheap universe
Cheap Universe

You wanted my taxes
You wanted my sins
You wanted my prayers so you got me cleaned

Go to hell or let me go to hell alone
Why we have to go together?
This world is made for those who don't feel at all

Go to hell i would be another girl
If i could but clearly i can't help myself
This is a cheap universe

This world is made for those who don't feel at all
This world is made for those who don't feel at all
This world is made for those who don't feel at all
This world is made for those who don't feel at all

This is a cheap universe
Cheap Universe.
