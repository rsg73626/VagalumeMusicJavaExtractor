BORROWED

Between me and my life ther’s a shiny crystal
I can see clearly through it, but I can’t ever touch it
You now people have to really suffer enough
To risk it all to do, what they really love

You have the winner ticket, To the lottery of hell
You never asked for perfection, Losing means elevation

Borrowed eyes, for looking into
You borrowed world, What the hell I got into?
Borrowed time, for spending into
Your borrowed world, What the hell I got into?

You know we forget what we want to remember
And we remember what we want to forget…

You have the winner ticket. To your own hell

Borrowed eyes, for looking into
You borrowed world, What the hell I got into?
Borrowed time, for spending into
Your borrowed world, What the hell I got into?

You’re fading
Like the copy of a copy
Of a bad story
No loss, but no glory

Borrowed eyes, for looking into
You borrowed world, What the hell I got into?
Borrowed time, for spending into
Your borrowed world, What the hell I got into?
