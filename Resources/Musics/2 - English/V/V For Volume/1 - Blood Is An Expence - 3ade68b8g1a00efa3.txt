BLOOD IS AN EXPENCE

I don’t know what I’m missing tonight
But I’m holding on bravely
And maybe today’s my last day on earth
But I feel like dancing
In the stars (so leave your gun in the closet)
Again (so leave your gun in the closet)

Let’s celebrate while making our delay
From human race, ‘cause I’m about to break you
Go outside, there’s nowhere else to hide
My hands are tied but I want to pick up a fight

In the stars (so leave your gun in the closet)
Again (so leave your gun in the closet)
I don’t know what I’m missing tonight
But I feel like dancing in the stars

So look at the sky, and let my fist be your guide
Blood is a big outlay, which I don’t think I could pay

I don’t know what I’m missing tonight
But I feel like dancing
In the stars (so leave your gun in the closet)

Again (so leave your gun in the closet)
So leave your gun in the closet (4)
