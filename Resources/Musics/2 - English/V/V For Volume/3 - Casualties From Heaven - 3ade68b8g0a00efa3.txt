CASUALTIES FROM HEAVEN

(While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping heaven descends to meet you)

There’s so much to tell you but I guess you’re always running
I’m putting my tennis shoes so I can keep up with you baby

I won’t give up, give yourself a break, Let me speak, or I’ill tell you
While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping heaven descends to meet you
While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping angels climb back to see you

How could I explain my crowded isolation?
Now we’re here, There’s no gun
Hugging your absence
Look at me, I’m letting you

While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping heaven descends to meet you
While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping heaven descends to meet you

Angels climb back to see you
Heaven climb back to see you

While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping heaven descends to meet you

While you’re sleeping, While you’re dreaming
While you’re sleeping heaven descends to meet you
No time to sleep, my dear, cause now the cops are here
They’re on to us,
Don’t expect some applause
