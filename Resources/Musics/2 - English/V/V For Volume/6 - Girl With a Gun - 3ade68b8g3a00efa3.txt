GIRL WITH A GUN

Hey! you girl, now you’re getting down with it
´cause now, you have it
Girl you gotta grab it
You’re sinner, a liar, and that is your power
And you’re playing with fire, regretting is sour….

Hey, you there
Serving all those cocktails
And of course, you boy
In line at the bank
She’s a sinner, a liar, and that is her power
‘cause she’s playing with fire, regretting is sour….

There she goes, the girl with all the guns,
She’s having fun, so blast them!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
The girl with the gun

Hey, you girl
Now you’re getting down with it
´cause now you have it
Girl you gotta grab it
You’re a sinner, a liar
And that is your power
And you’re playing with fire
Regretting is sour

You, the guy staring that jack daniel’s
And of course, you lady!
Yeah you smoking baby
Hey, believing is power, believing is power
And regretting is sour, regretting is sour

There she goes, the girl with all the guns,
She’s having fun, so blast them!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
The girl with the gun
I want to take you away
So let me show you the way
Everybody, come meet your devil!
Get down on the floor, all you rebels…

Hey, the devil helps those who help themselves
So come on, shake it up ‘cause your time is running out
Probe you’re here, you’re alive, you can scream like an ape
Happiness is your wargun

I want to take you away
So let me show you the way
Everybody, come meet your devil!
Get down on the floor, all you rebels…

There she goes, the girl with all the guns,
She’s having fun, so blast them!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
The girl with the gun
I want to take you away
So let me show you the way
Everybody, come meet your devil!
Get down on the floor, all you rebels…
