BREAKAWAY

Breakaway

 I can’t find another minute for myself 
To busy pleasing someone else today 
I’ve lost my way, wooh 
There’s gotta be a way of finding my way back 
Just have to take a different tack 
To where I’m at 

And the only thing, I really learned 
Is how to break, my fall 
And the fall again, my fingers burned 
Before I lose, it all 

(I’ve got to) Breakaway, breakaway (said I’d got to breakaway) 
No I can’t hesitate (said yes, I know) 
Oh release yourself (release yourself) 
Down to earth 
Breakaway, breakaway 
No I can’t hesitate 
Oh release yourself 
Down to earth 

It’s really hard to find a dream confusion reigns 
I hit my head against the wall again 
That’s not in vain 
There’s gotta be a better reason why I’m here 
Before I start to disappear 
I gotta get out of here 

And the only thing, I really learned 
Is how to break, my fall 
And the fall again, my fingers burned 
Before I lose, it all 

(I’ve got to) Breakaway, breakaway (said I'd got to breakaway) 
No I can’t hesitate (said yes, I know) 
Oh release yourself (release yourself)
Down to earth 
Breakaway breakaway 
No I can’t hesitate (yes I know) 
Oh release yourself
Down to earth 

I, I don’t wanna be here (I don’t wanna be here no) 
I, I don’t wanna be here (I don’t wanna be here you) 
Cause it's hard to move on to get back to the place I belong 

Before again 
My fingers burned 
Before I lose it all (yeah) 

(Said I'd got to) Breakaway, breakaway (said I’d got to breakaway) 
No I can’t hesitate (said yes, I know) 
Oh release yourself (release yourself) 
Down to earth 
(Bring it back one more time) 
Breakaway breakaway 
No I can’t hesitate 
Oh release yourself
Down to earth
