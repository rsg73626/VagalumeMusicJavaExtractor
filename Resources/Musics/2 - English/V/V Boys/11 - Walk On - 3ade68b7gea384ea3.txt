WALK ON

Walk On

This girl was the type you get dreams about
On a Sunday afternoon
The kind of girl you see stopping traffic downtown
On a sunny day in June

It wouldn't be right if I didn't pull up
To let her know she looked good
Hey ma, you know you're looking kinda fine,
Maybe you and I should

Hook up, go out
A few drinks, get down
You know we could have a lot of fun tonight
Come out with me

But be sane, don't play
It's alright, just say
I can't get ti down with another man's girl
So baby, please

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on

Two months have gone, she was fast to say
You're kind of cute
She got into my ride, I put it in drive
I said "I'll take care of you"

She was free for the night with nothing to do
We set the time and place
Almost fell, too good to be true
When I heard my girl say

Hook up, go out
A few drinks, get down
You know we could have a lot of fun tonight
Come out with me

But be sane, don't play
It's alright, just say
I can't get ti down with another man's girl
So baby, please

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on

Just pick up your cell phone, baby
Walk on
No time for your games, baby
Walk on
Put on your shoes and baby
Walk on
You think you can play me?
Walk on
Just pick yourself up, baby
Walk on
No time for your games, baby
Walk on
Put on your shoes and baby
Walk on
You think you can play me?

Yeah...

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on

If you got a man don't lead me on
If you got a man don't crowd my phone
If you got a man and say you don't
Find somebody else, walk on
