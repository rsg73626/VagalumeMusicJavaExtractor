CHILLS IN THE EVENING

Chills in the Evening

Being with you, was all that I needed 
And I don't know why, I was too blind to see it 
Now you're gone, and I need you here tonight 

You know that I can't sleep 'cos I'm terrified 
Feels like I'm falling down really fast inside 
And I'm wishing the night away 
These chills in the evening 
They won't go away 

And sometimes I feel like, I can't go on living 
There's not much to take, when you've done all the giving 
And now you're gone, and I need you here tonight 

You know that I can't sleep 'cos I'm terrified 
It feels like I'm falling Down really fast inside
And I'm wishing the night away
These chills in the evening 
They won't go away 

And now I need to find a way (a way) 
to stop this pain from getting stronger (yeah) 
I just can't explain 
I don't understand why you left me here 

You know that I can't sleep 'cos I'm terrified 
Feels like I'm falling down really fast inside 

And I'm wishing the night away 
These chills in the evening 
They won't go away 

You know that I can't sleep 'cos I'm terrified 
Feels like I'm falling down really fast inside 
And I'm wishing the night away 
These chills in the evening 
They won't go away 

They won't go away...
