YOU STOOD UP

You Stood Up

 [Antony.....] 
So i figure i'm alone now, alienated everyone, 
alot of my moves are wrong, but i didn't know you wouldn't be here to tell me, 
you thought three moves ahead, and all you said, 
was remember loving me, remember letting go, 
so i figure i know..... 

[chorus Antony]
You stood up and stole it, 
cos you never wanted me, 
you admit you don't feel it, 
but you stood up and stole it from me, 
Why stand up and steal it, 
if you never wanted me, 
admit you don't feel it, 
and give it all back to me. 

[Leon.... ]
so i guess i've got the space now after a lot of sabotage, 
i've got no one's ego to massage, 
but i didn't think that you'd be laughing somewhere, 
you'd already moved ahead, 
i lost my friend, 
and that for what was me i remember letting go, 
so i know i dont know.

[chorus All.... ]
You stood up and stole it, 
cos you never wanted me, 
you admit you don't feel it, 
but you stood up and stole it from me, 
Why stand up and steal it, 
if you never wanted me, 
admit you don't feel it, 
and give it all back to me.

[course All.... ]
You stood up and stole it, 
cos you never wanted me,

and give it all back to m
