BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS

Blood Sweat and Tears

If you say, that you don't want me
That's ok, I'm gonna get you anyway
If you think, you can avoid me
That's allright coz I don't mind a little fight

There's no doubt (there's no doubt)
That I've got what you need

All I know is I just wanna rock your world
And all I gotta say, I hope that it's ok yeah yeah
