HOLD ME

Hold Me

 Sometimes I feel like another
Brick in the wall
It's just your attitude that makes no sense at all
And I want you, want you, want you
Can't you see?
I've got known ambitions about you getting with me

Just hear me out, girl
Hear where I'm at
Just wanna be with you
What's wrong with that?

You're hiding from the truth and
It's there for all to see
It's right before your eyes, girl

So baby won't you
Hold me (Hold me baby)
day and night
Love me (Love me darling)
day and night
I need your love
Ohh yeah
I need your love
I need, I need your love

Alright

Just started talking
It's all we do
You've got to understand
Just what I'm going through
And I want you, want you, want you
Plain to see
It's my ambition, baby to have you here with me

You know
I'm gonna do things to you
So don't be shy
Don't worry
We'll take it slowly
Let you get to know me

Oh baby won't you
Hold me (Hold me baby)
day and night (day and night)
Love me (Love me darling)
day and night
I need your love (Said I need your love)
Your love
I need your love
I need, I need your love

Hold me (Hold me)
day and night (You know you wanna)
Love me (Love me, yeah)
day and night
I need your love (I need your love)
Your love
I need your love
I need, I need your love

As soon as I saw you
I knew
Things were gonna change
Ohh yeah
Feeling so confused
No ohh yeah

What do I have to do
To get the message through? 
Ohhhh...

I need, I need your love
I need, I need your love

Hold me (Hold me baby)
day and night (day and night)
Love me (Love me)
day and night
I need your love (I need your love right now)
Your love
I need your love
I need, I need your love

Hold me (Hold me baby)
day and night (day and night)
Love me (Bring it all back now)
day and night
I need your love (I need, yeah)
Your love
I need your love (I want your love)
I need your love
Your love

I need your love
Oh yeah 
So why don't you hold me?
