HIP TO HIP

Hip To Hip

When lady luck has got me down with her high speed attitude 
Am I feeling kinda high? Am I feeling kinda low? 
I feel so....I don't know like, fast food
Someones got my latte and I'm just not in the mood 
Need a little bit of this, need a little bit of that 
Some chit chat and thats why I'm the dude 

I got a feeling, somethings wrong 
I dialed your number, and then its gone 
I got a feeling, somethings whack 
Before I count to three your here with me, before the blues attack 

Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
Without you girl, the futures bleak 
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
I want you by my side 
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
You're gone a day, it's like a week 
Hip hip to hip cheek cheek to cheek 
I'm feeling good inside 

When lady luck is dressed in black and I'm dancing in my shoes
Trying to pull me to the left, trying to pull me to the right 
I just might sit tight stay in my groove 
I'm tired of people on my back, making offers I cant refuse I know that 
They believe I'm on on my knees, but I know I'll wont never lose yeah 

I got a feeling, somethings wrong 
I dialed your number, and then its gone
I got a feeling, somethings whack 
Before I count to three your here with me, before the blues attack 

Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
Without you girl the futures bleak 
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
I want you by my side 
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
You're gone a day, it's like a week 
Hip hip to hip cheek cheek to cheek 
I'm feeling good inside 

Twisted nation, missed a generation 
We dont need no education 
The rythym that your giving me is changing my life 
And Baby if you say jump, I say how high 
No deelin', steelin', only free wheeling 
Your giving a religion for me to believe in 
So rock me shock me, anyway you know 
But I guess I kinda like the status quo 

I got a feeling, somethings wrong 
I dialed your number, and then its gone
I got a feeling, somethings whack 
Before I count to three your here with me, before the blues attack (before the blues attack)

Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
Without you girl the futures bleak (allright)
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
I want you by my side (want you by my side) 
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
You're gone a day, it's like a week 
Hip hip to hip cheek cheek to cheek 
I'm feeling good inside 

Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
Without you girl the futures bleak (allright)
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
I want you by my side (by my side)
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
You're gone a day, it's like a week 
Hip hip to hip, cheek cheek to cheek 
I'm feeling good inside
