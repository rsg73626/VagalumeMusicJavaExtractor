STOP THE TEARS

Stop The Tears

You're broken, hurting
Your life is torn in two
You're searching for an answer
For the way he treated you
I feel if it was me by your side
There'd be no pain, cuz you'd be alright
I'll wipe the tears from your eyes

Baby, don't cry cuz you know I'll be there
To stop the tears from falling
With someone around you girl, I swear
I hope it's me you're calling
I'll be the sun after the storm
Run to my arms, forever more
Baby dont cry, cuz you know that I'm here
To stop your tears from falling

Don't cry, realise
Your soul will heal in time
Attention, some affection
Is what you need to find
I feel I've gotta let you know
That I'll give you love, the real kind of love,
Cuz seeing you like this hurts so much

Baby, don't cry cuz you know I'll be there
To stop the tears from falling
With someone around you girl, I swear
I hope it's me you're calling
I'll be the sun after the storm
Run to my arms, forever more
Baby dont cry, cuz you know that I'm here
To stop your tears from falling

If you're lost in the cold
Nowhere to go
Baby, hold on
I'll guide you home
Free from the pain
Happy again
Learning to live

Oh...

Baby, don't cry cuz you know I'll be there
To stop the tears from falling
With someone around you girl, I swear
I hope it's me you're calling
I'll be the sun after the storm
Run to my arms, forever more
Baby dont cry, cuz you know that I'm here
To stop your tears from falling

Baby, don't cry cuz you know I'll be there
To stop the tears from falling
With someone around you girl, I swear
I hope it's me you're calling
I'll be the sun after the storm
Run to my arms, forever more
Baby dont cry, cuz you know that I'm here
To stop your tears from falling

Oh yeah, to stop your tears from falling.
