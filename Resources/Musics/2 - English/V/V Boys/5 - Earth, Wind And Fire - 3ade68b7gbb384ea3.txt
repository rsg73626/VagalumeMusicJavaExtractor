EARTH, WIND AND FIRE

Earth, Wind And Fire

 When I was a kid I made a promise to myself,
To get me all the finer things in life,
I've been on a mission
Since the day that I was born,
But nothing comes without a sacrifice.

All that I could think of
Was how happy I would be
When I got everything that I was due
I got to where I wanted
But finally I see
The only thing I really want is you.

Earth, wind and fire
It's bringing me down, you're my only desire.
Earth, wind and fire
Only your love can take me higher.

I've been at the crossroads
Where you go to sell your soul
I thought the deal was I would get it all
I didn't see it coming,
I was moving way too fast
That's what happens when you're on a roll

I hope I'll be forgiven
The mistakes that I have made
But certain things can never be undone
I don't know where I'm going,
Or where I'm heading to
All I know is where I'm coming from

No, I won't give it away
If I could go back in time, I would make a change
No price is too high to pay
If only for a night, if only for a day

Earth, wind and fire
It's bringing me down, you're my only desire.
Earth, wind and fire
Only your love can take me higher.

If I can't have you
Then I don't want nothing at all
I need you there
To catch me if I should fall
If I can't have you
Then I don't want nothing at all
I need you there
To catch me if I should fall

Earth, wind and fire
It's bringing me down, you're my only desire.
Earth, wind and fire
Only your love can take me higher.

Earth, wind and fire
It's bringing me down, you're my only desire.
Earth, wind and fire
Only your love can take me higher.
