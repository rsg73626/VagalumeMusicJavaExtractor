FOOLS

Fools

Oh the fools who adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right

I'm a fool to adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right

When I'm lying, lonely
I just dream about you taking me back
I tell myself if only I could see you 
Then my heart wouldn't crack.

Is it cuz I'm not around
That you've got someone new by your side?
Why is it I'm not allowed to tell you all the dirt that I hide?

Fool by a fool
But the rules never told me
How to tangle with you
I'm confused
That I could only get in trouble with

Fools
who adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right

I'm a fool to adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right.

Wake in the early evening sun
And I think of you
I fight the sudden urge to run
And kiss you black and blue
Why does the going get so rough?
It's a mystery
Stop the world I'm getting off
It's way too weird for me

Oh the fools who adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right

I'm a fool to adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right

Oh the fools who adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right

I'm a fool to adore you
we're never the same
Once we cried in the rain
Over you
Same old story
And if wishing's a crime
Then I guess they were right
