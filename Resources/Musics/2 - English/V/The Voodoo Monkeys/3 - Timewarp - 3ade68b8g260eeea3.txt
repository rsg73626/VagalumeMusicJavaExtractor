TIMEWARP

Yes you know who you are
You come from near and afar
Got no new ideas
Gotta make it all clear

Aint gonna howl at the moon
Changes comin' real soon
Listen to this tune
What a bunch of hoons!

Yeah we got the bounty
You aint got a clue
Get back to orange county
Give respect where its due

Timewarp
You're just our sport
Gonna have some fun
The Voodoo Spell has just begun

Selling acid's your game
Ain't no way to the fame
You're really lame
But we can stand the pain

Timewarp
You're just our sport
Gonna have some fun
The Voodoo Spell has just begun
