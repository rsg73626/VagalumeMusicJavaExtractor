PLEASE DON'T CALL ME A MINDLESS PHILOSOPHY

It's been so long
Since I've felt
Inspiration running through
Our blood and your veins, to be
This is suffocating
Me at the point of no return
I'm the target
How much is comfort worth to these broken arms and blackened hearts?
I'll hide my minority lips
Awkward conversations
How much is comfort worth to us?
This will we must
Wash our hands
Elementary fingerprints
Shout out defense, defense, defense
This is suffocating
Me at the point of no return
I'm the target
How much is comfort worth to these broken arms and blackened harts?
I'll hid my minority lips
Awkward conversation
How much is comfort worth to us?
And marigold doesn't grow (past six tenth desired size)
As for asphyxiation its down and out
And marigold doesn't grow(and I'll keep counting lies)
(I'm breathing quite fine, I'm breathing quite fine)
Just don't hold you breath now
