HUNTING FOR YOU

Up the Hawley, down the tube station,
in the Dublin Castle and the Lord Canaervon,
check out the Wheatsheaf, go up Dingwall's Lock,
oh girl, I ain't gonna give up.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I'm huntin' for you
huntin' for you
huntin' for you
I'm huntin' for you

Check out Somers Town and the Crowndale Estate,
a bit of Regents Park near Gloucester Gate,
Camden High Street and a bit of Chalk Farm,
Hey girl, I'm tracking you down

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Look in the World's End, the Paradise too,
I'm looking everywhere for you,
The Lock Tavern, The Golden Grill,
C'mon darling, I'm looking still
