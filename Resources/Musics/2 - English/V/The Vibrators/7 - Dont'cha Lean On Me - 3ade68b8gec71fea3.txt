DONT'CHA LEAN ON ME

Baby's on some program, 
Got vaccuum tube lookin' eyes. 
Gotta block of ice for a heart, 
F one elevens in the sunrise. 

There ain't no escape, 
I'll follow wherever you go. 
Combat boots all over this land, 
Hey hey rockets a go-go. 

But don't you lean on me, 
I'm innnocent don't you see. 
Don't you lean on me, 
Oh no. 

There's soldiers in the suburbs, 
Givin' you the shakedown. 
Everybodies gettin' nervous, 
The SS are back in town. 

You got the kind of lips. 
I wanna kiss. 
Crucifixion on your bed, 
Stealth fighters pass overhead. 
Stealth fighters pass overhead.
