SWEET SWEET HEART

Sweet sweet heart,
Sweet heart.
Sweet sweet heart,
Oh sweet sweet heart.

And you can always bring out the stars,
On the stormiest nights.
And you can always make it rain,
When the sun is shining bright.

Sweet sweet heart,
Sweet heart.
Sweet sweet heart,
Oh sweet sweet heart.

I remember when we were young,
Things used to look so pretty.
But now we're getting old,
I feel things have become so shitty.

Sweet sweet heart,
Sweet heart.
Sweet sweet heart,
Oh sweet sweet heart.

Sweet sweet heart,
Sweet heart.
Sweet sweet heart,
Oh sweet sweet heart.
