UNDER THE RADAR

I wasn't looking for a new girlfriend
But she got through in the end
Radar interception was working the coast
The display looking for any ghosts
Had the controls cranked up real high
Even had me a spy in the sky
Elevated orange alert
Should easily be able to deal with a small-town flirt

She wasn't a one-night stand, love invader
She got through under the radar
Like a stealth fighter she came in
Under the radar

I didn't pick up any readings from you
You weren't there then you broke through
Aluminium chaff, decoys and flares
Made it seem that you weren't there
Radar jamming, it ain't new to me
But she's using some strange electricity
Yeah, she was clever, she was smart
She found a new way to get to my heart

I thought I could easily evade her
She got through under the radar
Stasi, police spy
She got through under the radar

I was super wary of you
I didn't want another girl getting through
But you somehow caught me off-guard
I didn't know I could fall so hard

I wasn't looking for a new girlfriend
But you got through in the end
You came gliding in like mercury
Didn't have time to say you looked good to me
'cos you knew what you were doing
Had your helicopter gunships closing in
I surrendered with scarely a word
After catastrophic failure by early bird

Like a stasi police spy
She got through under the radar
Like a stealth fighter she came in
Yeah, under the radar
I thought I could easily evade her
But she got through under the radar
Fifth columnist love spy
She got through under the radar
