SHE'S BRINGING YOU DOWN

Here she comes, you know she's bringing you down. 
You always said you'd be the last one to leave town. 
But now you say that she's a bitch, 
She's got that seven year itch. 
Been and put you in a ditch, 
An' you're gonna blow your brains out. 
Never saw her cheatin', 
All you heard was your own poor heart beatin', 
Don'tcha cry when you see her goin' by, 
Oh no no no no no no no. 

She's real dynamite, she'll make you scream and shout. 
You always said you knew what it was all about. 
But now you're caught in a trap, 
Oh my god you say as you look back, 
If only you'd known which way things were gonna be goin', 
Never saw her cheatin', 
All you heard was your own poor heart beatin', 
Don'tcha cry when you see her goin' by, 
Oh no no no no no no no.
