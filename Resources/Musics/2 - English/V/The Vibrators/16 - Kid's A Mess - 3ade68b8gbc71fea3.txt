KID'S A MESS

The kid's a mess, the kid's a mess
The kid's a mess, the kid's a mess hey

Hi-tops heading for the Old Bailey,
Curtains is in the out tray,
stocking tops is singing like a canary,
Ain't nothing gonna save you and me.

All the aggravation's doing me in,
I'm looking forward to doing time in Sing-Sing,
You crawled forth from your stately home,
you crawled forth, now you're crawling back again.

the kid's a mess hey
the kid's a mess

Janet steals, Johnny drives a stolen car,
all the hormones are making them go too far,
The parents they don't know what to do,
kids today are crazy, through and through.

The Kid's a mess
