SHE'S THE ONE YOU NEED

She's the one you want, 
She's the one you need. 
Yeah she's the one, 
The one you see in all your dreams. 

She's the one you wanna tell the world about, 
The one that you can't do without. 
The one who makes you pull your hair out, 
You're the one on her lil' roundabout. 

She's the one who's got you cryin', 
With your head down between your knees. 
She's the one you need. 

She's the one you need, 
She's the one your imagination feeds. 
She's the one you see in all your dreams, 
But to her you don't mean a thing. 

She's the one whose got you runnin', 
Like tomorrow's never comin', 
She's the one you need. 
(Yeah -) 

She's the one you want, 
She's the one you need. 
Yeah, she's the one, 
The one your imagination feeds. 

She's the one you think's so perfect, 
The one you can't forget. 
You're the one caught in her net, 
Yeah you're the one she treats as a lil' pet.
