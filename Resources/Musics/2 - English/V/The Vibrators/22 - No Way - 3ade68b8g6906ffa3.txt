NO WAY

You always gave me grief
Stealing my time, you little thief
I thought your love was true
That's why I stuck it out with you

You went off with one of my friends
You said it wouldn't happen again
I was stupid I suppose
I caught you putting back on your clothes

Hey girl, there's no way
I'm sticking with you another day
[x2]

I thought you were okay
A little bit weird in your way
It was you who wrecked my car
You're nobody, not a movie star

Hey girl, there's no way
I'm sticking with you another day
[x2]

Stole my chequebook and you tried to torch my flat
Were rude to my friends and you tried to kill the cat
It didn't take you long, I swear
Before you'd become my worst nightmare

You used to lie and lie
Now it's goodbye goodbye
Our relationship, there's nothing in it
I can't stand you for another minute

Hey girl, there's no way
I'm sticking with you another day
[x4]
