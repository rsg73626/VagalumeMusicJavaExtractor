LETTING YOU GO

<i>[Verse 1:]</i>
If I thought for a minute you'd change your mind,
I'd be down on the very next train.
But I heard from a few of our mutual friends,
That you don't wanna see me again. 

<i>[Verse 2:]</i>
Only you know the reasons why I can't cope,
With your clothes and your records all gone.
Went off with the keys, never once did you phone.
Left me lost and alone for so long.

<i>[Mid. 8:]</i>
Just what things you've been saying,
What games you've been playin',
Who with girl I'd rather not know.
Took all I gave and threw it back in my face,
Now I'm forced into letting you go.

<i>[Verse 3:]</i>
Though I hoped for a while you'd call my bluff,
That you'd be back lying beside me.
For myself mother comfort was never enough,
Now it' seems like it's fait accomplie.

<i>[Mid. 8.2:]</i>
I'll know better next time around,
Should've guessed from the very start.
I waas oblivious to what's going down,
I've been left with a broken heart. (Oh Yeah -)

<i>[Solo]</i>

<i>[Mid. 8.1:]</i>
Just where things you've been staying,
What games you've been playin',
Who with girl I'd rather not know.
Took all I gave and threw it back in my face,
Now I'm forced into letting you go.

<i>[Repeat Verse 1]</i>

<i>[Outro:]</i> Why d'ya have to let me down now baby,
<i>[repeat 'til end]</i>
