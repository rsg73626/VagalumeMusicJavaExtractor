OIL

What're you gonna do when the oil's all gone
When you flick that switch and nothing comes on
Jump in your car, it won't even cross the yard
Alternative energy proved too hard

Me, I'm starting to stink, I can't wash my clothes
Welcome to the future, but hold your nose
Go to bed early 'cos I ain't got a light
From where I'm stumbling the future don't look bright

We threw it all away [x2]

What're you gonna do when the oil's all gone
When you flick that switch and nothing comes on
I can't even make a joke tonight
Will the last person on earth turn out the light

We threw it all away [x2]
