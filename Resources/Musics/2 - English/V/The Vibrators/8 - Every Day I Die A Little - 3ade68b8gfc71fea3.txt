EVERY DAY I DIE A LITTLE

A promise in every sunset,
A death in every dawn.
Every day I die a little darling.

Night-time falls when you hit the hit the town.
Snakehips I heard you on the radio.

The prices are falling on Murder Mile,
And Judas Iscariot gives me a knowing smile.
And three men in a Cadillac drive across the sand,
To where a fire burns over a new Bethlehem
An' every day I die a little darling.
Yeah every day I die a little darling.

<i>[Solo]</i>

Nuclear waste made free for us all,
And governments topple and governments fall.
And out ride the four horsemen of the apocalypse,
The spittle falling from their fevered lips.
An' every day I die a little darling,
Yeah every day I die a little girl.
Night-time falls when you hit the hit the town.
Snakehips I heard you on the radio.
'Cause every day I die a little darling.
Yeah every day every day I die a little darling.
Looks like there's gonna be a traffic jam up in heaven tonight,
'Cause every day I die a little darling.

Every day I die a little darling
