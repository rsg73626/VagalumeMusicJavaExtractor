THE ALTAR AT MIDNIGHT

Yeah, you ain't no archangel
You ain't no voodoo doll
So come on over here now
We can get on very well, oh yeah

You ain't no millionaire's daughter
You ain't no lamb being led to the slaughter
This ain't no pirate ship
Hey c'mon girl, get here quick, oh yeah

I really wanna see you here
So get in a cab and come across
We can lie on these burning sheets
And we can pray to jesus, oh yeah

Yeah, I love yer
Oh yeah, I love yer
Ah, come here doll
Oh yeah

Now come here now, I think I love yer
You're driving me insane, I want you here right now
Yeah, I want you now
I want you here
On these burning sheets
Oh yeah
Pray to jesus
With your voodoo doll
On the altar at midnight [x2]
