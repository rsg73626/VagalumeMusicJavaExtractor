AMPHETAMINE BLUE

Amphetamine Blue 

My whole world's turned amphetamine blue,
Now I'm livin' without you.
My whole world's turned amphetamine blue,
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Well she up an' left me just the other day,
I thought that she was foolin' an' wouldn't go away.
We had our ups an' downs baby I know, 
Promise never to argue if you won't go.

Well I can't face my room alone tonight,
I'd rather walk the city 'til broad daylight.
She was the best girl I had for sure,
Couldn't believe she'd go out through that door.

If you're desperate sure any girl'll do,
But she was someone I could talk to.
I never really appreciated what she'd done.
But she was the one I set my heart on.
(Yeah)

An' I don't think I'm gonna come through.
