SULPHATE

There he goes
He's running out of time
He gets stuck in a pretty red top
Happens all the time

He's up for all night
He's up for all day
And when he's coming down
You better stay out of his way

He ain't a copper [?]
He's just a manager, that's all he wants

He's gone
He ran out of time
[?] pretty red top
Happens all the time

He ain't a copper [?]
He's just a manager, that's all he wants

He's gone
He ran out of time
[?] pretty red top
It's a heavenly cunt

Now he's up there with the angels
He's flying really high
I bet right now he's talking with jesus
Way up there in the sky

And he's gone
He ran out of time
[?] pretty red top
It's a heavenly cunt
