RIP UP THE CITY

Rip up the city,
Burn it all down now.
'Cos we ain't goin' no place,
We got nowhere to run.

The city's full of poison
The city's full of hate.
The city's full of false promises,
Let's open up the prison gates. (Hey hey)

Rip up the city,
Burn it all down now.
'Cos we ain't goin' no place,
we got nowhere to run.

An you can keep your inner city schemes,
And your centres of culture.
You got us livin' in a concrete nightmare,
You've given us no future.

Rip up the city,
Burn it all down now.
Death to suburbia,
An' to the uptown.

Rip up the city,
Burn it all down now.
'Cos we ain't goin' no place,
we got nowhere to run.

An' you can keep your shoppin' centres,
Who the hell were they built for.
An' you can stick your brave new world,
'Cos bricks and gasoline'll come knockin' on your door.

Mid. 8: We don't want no police harrassement,
The kids want the schools to shut down.
An' we don't wanna pay no taxes,
We just want a little rock'n'roll fun (hey hey).

Rip up the city,
Burn it all down now.
Death to suburbia,
An' to the uptown.
Rip up the city.
Rip up the city.
Rip up the city.
Rip up the city, an' burn it all down!
