BABY BABY

Mmm, you're so pretty, 
Not to talk to you would be a crime. 
Aah, let me put my arms around you, 
Just wanna use up a litt;le of your time. 
(And I go -) 

Baby baby baby, 
Baby baby baby, 
Baby baby baby,]</i> 
Won't you be my girl. 

Aah, your eyes are so pretty, 
And the clothes you wear they're so fine. 
Hey won't you come round to my place 
Just wanna use up a little of your time. 
(And I go -) 

Baby baby baby, 
Won't you be my girl, 
Etc.
