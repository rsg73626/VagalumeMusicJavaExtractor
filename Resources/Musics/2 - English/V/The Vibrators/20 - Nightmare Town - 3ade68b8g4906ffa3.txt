NIGHTMARE TOWN

Take a look at your town tonight
I don't see any nightlife
It's been plenty a years
Since anyone's had a good time around here
Sure, there's people all around
But at night this becomes a ghost town
You gotta get out before it's too late
You gotta get out and it can't wait

Darkness falls on your faceless town
Its painted smile and its hidden frown
Plenty of buildings but nothing to do
It's just like radiation, it's killing you

Take a really good look around
See how bad it is in this boring town
Don't it all just get to you?
Don'tcha wish you were like me, just passing through
I can hear them nailing your coffin lid down
Lose the will to live in this nightmare town
Fragile people out on bloodstained streets
Nervous sentinels round curtains do peep

Darkness falls on your faceless town
Its painted smile and its hidden frown
Plenty of buildings but nothing to do
It's just like radiation, it's killing you

Take a look at your town tonight
I don't see any nightlife
It's been plenty a years
Since anyone's had a good time around here
Don't it all just get to you?
Don'tcha wish you were like me, just passing through
'cos every day's burning the same
Neural pathway into your brain

Darkness falls on your faceless town
Its painted smile and its hidden frown
Plenty of buildings but nothing to do
It's just like radiation, it's killing you

Darkness falls on your faceless town [x2]

Darkness falls on your faceless town
Its painted smile and its hidden frown
Plenty of buildings but nothing to do
It's just like radiation, it's killing you
Darkness falls on your faceless town [x2]
