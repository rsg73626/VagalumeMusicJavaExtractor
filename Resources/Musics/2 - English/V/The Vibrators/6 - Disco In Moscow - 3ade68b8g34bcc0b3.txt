DISCO IN MOSCOW

Everybody is dancin', dancin' Disco
All the way from London to San Francisco
They're dancin' in the yards
Showing up their long?

I wonder if you're dancin'
I wonder if you're dancin'
I wonder if you're dancin'
Disco in Moscow (Moscow, Moscow)

I wonder if you're dancin'

Everybody is movin'
Shoulder to shoulder
Movin' and groovin'
The whole world over
They're dancing in the yards
Showing up their long?

I wonder if you're dancin'
I wonder if you're dancin'
I wonder if you're dancin'
Disco in Moscow

I wonder if you're dancin'

Everybody is dancing, dancing Disco
Moving and grooving
They're dancin Disco
They're dancin in the yards
Showing up they're big, big smiles

I wonder if they're dancing
I wonder if they're dancing
I wonder if you're dancing
Disco in Moscow
