NO GETTING OVER YOU

I've been up and I've been down. 
Been all over this dirty town. 
But I guess there's no gettin' over you. 

Tried drinkin' in all your bars, 
Tried lookin' up at all the stars. 
But I guess there's no gettin' over you. 

"Cos you knew all love's games. 
An' I'm so broken now and in pain. 
I guess I don't know, 
How to put the pieces together again. 

Ooh I'm losin' you, 
My whole world's turned blue. 
I guess there's no gettin' over you. 
(Oh no) 

Girls told me not to throw my heart away, 
You know it's too late today. 
I guess there's no gettin' over you.
