STIFF LITTLE FINGERS

Hangs a naked light over your face shines electric ness upon your bed 
if it wasn't for your stiff little fingers nobody would know you were dead 
you never really did much living you mainly sat and watched your TV 
I think it had you on remote control ticking over nicely 
but you screwed up this time now you got to start from the bottom again 
It's a serious game when you got to start from the bottom again
I want to be dead the optician said 20 20 but you stumbled round like you were blind 
you never saw beyond your own 4 walls it's a shame you never saw the light 
but you screwed up this time now you got to start from the bottom again 
It's a serious game when you got to start from the bottom again 
when you got to start from the bottom again 
when you got to start from the bottom again 
when you got to start from the bottom again
I'm gonna start now
