WE'RE THE DEAD

We're calling you girl, from the other side
Won't you become our spectral bride?
You can come and dance in limbo
We love to feed on another bimbo

We're the dead [x3]

You used to live in north west three
Now you're a discorporate entity
Didn't know your life was through
Till we came to collect you

We're the dead [x3]

You're gonna feed us
With your flesh and your guts
We can find you even if you're hidden
And for us nothing is forbidden

We're the dead [x3]

We inhabit the spirit world
We get so hungry, girl
We wanna get our hands on you
But our hands, they are see-thru

We're the dead [x3]

For some it's another burning day in hell
Look at them, they don't look so well
The pain's so terrible you see
But it only lasts for eternity

We're the dead [x3]
