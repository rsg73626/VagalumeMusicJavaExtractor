U238 (NA NA NA)

Na na na, etc. 

U238 is in the atomic sea, 
For satellite hatred she'll melt a city. 
And the Earth will lie wrapped in a nuclear curtain, 
No-one will escape that seems for certain. 
(An' I go -) 

U238 turns to U235, 
What a great party we're all gonna die. 
Big black curtain comin' down on me, 
And you can't phone back from eternity. 
(Oh no, an' I go -) 

Ooh - whoo - ooh, 
Don'tcha worry little angel 
Ooh - whoo - ooh, 
Don'tcha worry little angel. 

Engage the enemy, engage your heart, 
Lock in the computer and blow him apart.
