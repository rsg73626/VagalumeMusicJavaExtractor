JUICE ON

Sittin' in the electric chair, 
Soon I'll be gone, 
Hey warden turn the juice on. 

Been a bad man or so they say, 
Me I blame it on my DNA. 
Couldn't help goin' wrong. 
Hey warden turn the juice on. 

It was the start of the huntin' season, 
Had a lil' accident with a machine gun. 
Went an' sprayed my dad an' mom, 
Hey warden turn the juice on. 

Thought I had a license to kill, 
I did it for the money an' I did it for the thrill. 
Ski mask an' a shotgun, 
Hey warden turn the juice on. 

Breakin' into houses for a lil' killin' an' torture, 
I admit it ain't doin' what I oughta. 
A lil' rape a lil' homicide, 
Always made me feel so good inside. 
(Come on -) 

I've been a lil' antisocial in my time, 
But is choppin' up girls such a crime. 
Don't care what they say when I'm gone, 
Hey warden turn the juice on. 

I've done a few things I can't tell you friend, 
Society says I gotta make amends. 
Eatin' people they say is wrong, 
Hey warden turn the juice on. 

Turn off your lights, your kettles an' TVs, 
Warden needs all that juice for fryin' me. 
Sittin' in the electric chair soon I'll be gone, 
Hey warden turn the juice on.
