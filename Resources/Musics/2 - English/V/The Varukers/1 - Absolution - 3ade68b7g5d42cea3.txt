ABSOLUTION

You follow the rules
He spews out the lies
You kneel on the floor
Priest stands on high

Reject their lies, absolution

You confess all your sins
He prays for your soul
You beg for forgiveness
Now he has control

Reject their lies, absolution

You're living in fear
Of the stories he tells
Forever in heaven
Or forever in hell

Reject their lies, absolution

Try living you life
Stop living in fear 
I'll have no home
In the heaven you create
