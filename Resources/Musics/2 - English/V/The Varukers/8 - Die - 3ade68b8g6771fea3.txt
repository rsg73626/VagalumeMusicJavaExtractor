DIE

I would love to meet you, meet you by myself
So i can be released from my living hell

The anger that I feel inside will never go away
Until I see you die

My selfish revenge yes it will make me feel good
So I can live my life again, live it to the full

The anger that I feel inside will never go away
Until I see you die

I want to see you suffer pain that you've never felt
I want to see the knife as I stick it in your throat

The anger that I feel inside will never go away
Until I see you die

I'd like to see you hanging, swinging from a rope
You had no right to do what you did, I hope you fucking choke
