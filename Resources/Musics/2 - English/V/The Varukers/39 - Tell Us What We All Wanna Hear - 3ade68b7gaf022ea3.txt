TELL US WHAT WE ALL WANNA HEAR

Fill us with your corruption and you lies still you wonder why you're so despised
Why don't you just tell us what we all wanna hear
Why don't you just tell us what we all wanna hear
Brought this country down was that your aim
Brought this country down just for fame
Why don't you just tell us what we all wanna hear
Why don't you just tell us what we all wanna hear
Fill us with your corruption and you lies still you wonder why you're so despised
