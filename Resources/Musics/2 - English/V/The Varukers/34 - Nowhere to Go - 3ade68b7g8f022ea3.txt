NOWHERE TO GO

Living in a city full of urban decay
All you see around all that you say
Living in a city full of dust and shit
Unemployed statistics don't help a bit

You've just gotta break out of your hole
Without a job you've got nowhere to go
You've just gotta break out of your hole
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
