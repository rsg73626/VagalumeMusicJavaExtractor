FUCKED IT UP AGAIN

GO!

Foaming at the mouth
Looking like a rabid dog
Woke up with paranoia
At the end of my rope
Well a few years ago i was king of the hill
Now im drowning like sentenced swill

Fucked it up I Fucked it up
I fucked it up I Fucked it up again <i>[x2]</i>

I was being fucking loud 
shouting into the ears
See with heavy hands
Still puking at the bars
Pissed off bout' the order of the dress
Staring into the mirror
Fuck you look your best

Fucked it up I Fucked it up
I fucked it up I Fucked it up again <i>[x2]</i>

Say that your too old
Too long in the tooth
For mind and body
And that friend you call abuse
5 days off you get the back seat
Far too weak and its the weekend again

Fucked it up I Fucked it up
I fucked it up I Fucked it up again <i>[x2]</i>

Foaming at the mouth
Looking like a rabid dog
Woke up with paranoia
At the end of my rope
Well a few years ago i was king of the hill
Now im drowning like sentenced swill

Fucked it up I Fucked it up
I fucked it up I Fucked it up again... i fucked it up... again
