DON'T CONFORM

It's up to us if we die out hair it's up to us what clothes we wear
We're supposed to live in a democracy well then listen it's up to me
Don't conform
Don't conform
We don't wanna be like you I don't wanna look like you
We're supposed to live in a democracy well then listen it's up to me
