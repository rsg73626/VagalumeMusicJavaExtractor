UNDER ATTACK

You sit in moral judgement of who and what I am
You dictate the standing in my life that controls are in your hand

Under attack

You want to break the welfare chain this cross upon your back
Any sense of obligation is exactly what you lack

Under attack

Another statistic off your list, another number down in file
More faceless factory fodder
For the work force you compile

Under attack

Baton down the hatches and tighten up the screw
Reduction of the benefit with no effect on you
