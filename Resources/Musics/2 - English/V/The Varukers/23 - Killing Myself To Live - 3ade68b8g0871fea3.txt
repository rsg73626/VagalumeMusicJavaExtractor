KILLING MYSELF TO LIVE

You been believing in me forever everyday 
Keep taking no matter, no matter what I say
well taking and taking and never want to give
Keep sucking me dry how do you expect me to live

Killing myself to live
I got nothing left to give  
Kick me down when I fall 
the bastards want it all <i>[x2]</i>

You like the new band shirt you bought at the mall
Your like the wolfs sniping at the door
You think I should be grateful for what I receive?
You think I'm just dreaming, Is that what you believe?

Killing myself to live
I got nothing left to give  
Kick me down when I fall 
The bastards want it all <i>[x4]</i>
