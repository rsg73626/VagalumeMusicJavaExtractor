MARCH OF THE S.A.S.

See the SAS as they go marching through your door
See the SAS as they smash down your wall
See the SAS as they scream and shout
See the SAS as they march about
Terrorist attack
Terrorist attack
Terrorist attack
Terrorist attack
Terrorist attack
Terrorist attack get the SAS
If you get kidnapped outside your house
Don't worry the SAS will be as quiet as a mouse
If you get hijacked from your plane
Don't worry the SAS will get you back again

See the pull of the sten gun as he squeezes the trigger
See the pull of the sten gun as he squeezes the trigger
See the bleeding heart see the bleeding heart see the bleeding
As they fall on the floor can't take no more
