BLEED US DRY

Inner city deprivation welfare system erodes away
Reduction of life's facilities and still you want us to pay

You bleed us fucking dry

Desperation of the people trying to keep above the line
The more you take the less you give now that ain't fucking right

You bleed us fucking dry

The harder you work the less that you get
What seems the fucking point when you're working up a sweat

You bleed us fucking dry

Try to keep us all in line work hard and obey bleed us of our life line hard work and low pay
