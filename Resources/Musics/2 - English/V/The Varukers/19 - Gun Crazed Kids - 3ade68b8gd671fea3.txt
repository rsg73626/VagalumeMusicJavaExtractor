GUN CRAZED KIDS

Heard about the craze of the new school days
Take along a gun blow people away
Three plus one that makes four
Now education ain't such a bore

Gun crazed kids twisted fucked up gun crazed kids

Go to school with hate filled eyes
Destruction of life in their minds
Don't need to learn to read and write
Got their career right in their sights

Gun crazed kids twisted fucked up gun crazed kids

Never again get called a jerk
Take revenge it's gonna fucking hurt
Pull the trigger theree plus one
See their maths ain't so fucking wrong

You're given the right to bear arms
When things fuck up sound the alarm
Make up your minds right or wrong
Who takes the blame now the deed is done
