DANCE 'TILL YOU'RE DEAD

Dance, Dance 'till you're dead
Dance, Dance 'till you're dead
Dance, Dance 'till you're dead
Dance 'till you're dead
Music drives you crazy
You're gonna blow your mind
Still you've gotta dance 
You've gotta keep in time

Dance, Dance 'till you're dead

Now you realize you can't keep on
Now you realize there's something wrong
