WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW

So you say we sound like a vacuum cleaner
And you say we don't go with dinner
And you say we can't keep a beat
And you say you can't tap your feet
Oh yea what the hell do you know
Oh yea at least at least at least we're trying
You're always there trying to put me down
You're always there trying to push me around
We'll I'm just gonna warn you
We'll soon be back to get you
