PUNK AIN'T DEAD

All this music's gone to my head.
The old man shouts get out of bed.
You know something son, Punk ain't dead.
Punk ain't dead, Punk ain't dead.

Someone said Punk is dead.
Bring him here and we'll smash his head.
People thought that we'd gone away.
But we're here and we're here to stay.

Last night i was in a club.
Saw a band called the UK Subs.
Next on was the fucking Damned.
Fucking hell, the place was crammed.

Don't believe what the papers say.
They all reckon we've gone away.
Why don't they open up their eyes.
See they're writing lies, lies, lies.
