DIE FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT

They're the ones to declare the war
We're the ones die for the cause
They pull the trigger on the gun
We die they have fun.
Die for your governments convenience.
The government are safe they're underground
Don't care about the bodies lying around
They don't care who they kill
Just as long as they get their thrill.
Die for your governments convenience.
