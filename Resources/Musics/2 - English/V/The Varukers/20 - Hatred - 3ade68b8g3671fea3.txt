HATRED

Beliefs passed down generation of ignorance and lies
Open your closed mind you'll be surprised what you may find

Fear Hatred Lies
You decide

There's good and bad in all people every color country and creed
Don't accept the indoctrination don't believe what they perceive

Fill your head with hatred reject their fear and despise
What side of the fence do you stand on its time to decide
