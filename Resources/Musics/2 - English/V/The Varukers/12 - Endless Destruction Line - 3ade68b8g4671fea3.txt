ENDLESS DESTRUCTION LINE

Running through the streets trying to evade
Weapons of destruction that will put them in their grave

Endless destruction line

The stench of rotting corpses decaying where they fall
Men women children die where they fall

Another bomb explosion another charred remains
A gunshot opens fire another victim slain

One more child orphaned left to struggle to survive
Another wife widowed she has no reason why
