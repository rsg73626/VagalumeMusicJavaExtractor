NO EDUCATION

School was a fucking drag
Taking orders from a fucking old bag
We all knew she was on the rag
Wha a fucking old bag

We don't need no education
You can stick it up your arsehole

I never learned a fucking thing
I only waited for the bell to ring
None of the teachers liked me
They said don't ask for pity

They day I left the place
They said "you're a real disgrace"
Before they said anything else
I said watch out mate or else.
