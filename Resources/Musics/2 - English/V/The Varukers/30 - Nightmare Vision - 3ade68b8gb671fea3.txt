NIGHTMARE VISION

here lies our earth its dead in torment
the cancers been caused by our abuse

battlefields computer board games
corporation drown out our cries
men in suits slaughter thousands
sign a check so many die

as parasites that crawled upon her
who tied the knot that fixed the noose

roulettes the game that we are playing
more happy news reports another slaying

So many lives so many cultures
so many poor in every race
