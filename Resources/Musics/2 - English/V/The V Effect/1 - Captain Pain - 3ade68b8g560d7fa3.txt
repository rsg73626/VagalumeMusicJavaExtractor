CAPTAIN PAIN

Now tell me Captain Pain,
should I start it again?
I've got one chance
that I am not gonna waste
so I put my heart in a suitcase
and hope for another great day

Oh tell me Captain Pain,
why are you always the blame?
You humble people everywhere
and you do not seem to care
But I know that is not you
and I am not going to believe them

Should I be shocked with what you said?
Should I?
Should I?
Whoa oh oh
Should I be shocked with what you said?
Should I?
Should I?
Whoa oh oh

(James' screaming)

Now go ahead Captain Pain,
you always regret what you say
and I know I am right
and you know that you are fine

You're fine now, aren't you?
You're doing what you wanna do

Should I be shocked with what you said?
Should I?
Should I?
Whoa oh oh
Should I be shocked with what you said?
Should I?
Should I?
Whoa oh oh

You're taking my bible of lies and God, it hurts
Go on and play on my side but babe don't lie
You're not gonna fool me again, Captain Pain
No Captain Pain, not again

(whispering)
Slipping by my hands and you'll run away again
running through the dark side of me
I washed away your sad old days from you memory

Should I be shocked with what you said?
Should I?
Should I?
Whoa oh oh
Should I be shocked with what you said?
Should I?
Should I?
Whoa oh oh

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa
