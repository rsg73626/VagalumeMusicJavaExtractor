THE STRONGEST

Don't make me choose between
what I need and what I want
Because they are totally different things
and I am only one
I need it all and I need no one
and if it had never begun
you know I'm unkind
and I'm not fun
I can't lie this time
I just can't run

What if I had never met you?
What if I could just forget you?
What if you had never stopped hating me?
What if we were something from the very start?
What if you had always been the one in my heart?
We would be just fine

But I couldn't handle the pain
I had it all once, I won't have it all again
If I don't choose one now, I'll lose all I've got
and it includes you, you know
I could give up on the two of you
the ones I love and I wouldn't make it through
I couldn't hurt anyone but me

What if I had never met you?
What if I could just forget you?
What if you had never stopped hating me?
What if we were something from the very start?
What if you had always been the one in my heart?
We would be just fine

But if I don't make my mind
none of us will ever get better in time
and no one'll win as long as one of us's losing
you were always the strongest
you can get through this
you were always the strongest
