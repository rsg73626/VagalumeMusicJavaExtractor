JEALOUSY JEALOUSY

I don't know what made me think
that I could take care of you
if I can hardly take care of me
I never meant that I would fear
you always knew I could be
more than what you see

How could I want somebody
that don't even worry about it?
That doesn't make me wanna stay
You got me stuck here, anyway

Jealousy, jealousy taking over you

We might break down
we won't know how to turn around
You fought for something
that could never be right here
With you
and I guess it's never been your time
so just wait, wait
I'm not what you’ve been waiting for
that's why you can’t get more 

Keep it only inside my head
I never said it wasn’t dead
well, it's not alive
You don't know what you should say
I don't know if I should stay
day after day

How could I want somebody
that don't even worry about it?
That doesn't make me wanna stay
You got me stuck here, anyway

Jealousy, jealousy taking over you and me
You and me

We might break down
we won't know how to turn around
You fought for something
that could never be right here
With you
and I guess it's never been your time
so just wait, wait
I'm not what you’ve been waiting for
that's why you can’t get more 

You know that all you know
Doesn't mean a thing to me
Don't go thinking I'm mean
I'm saying you should agree

We might break down
'cause you fought for something
that you could never have

Jealousy, jealousy taking over you
You and me
Jealousy, jealousy
Coming out of my dreams

I can't explain it all

We might break down
we won't know how to turn around
You fought for something
that could never be right here
With you
and I guess it's never been your time
so just wait, wait
I'm not what you’ve been waiting for
that's why you can’t get more 
I'm not what you’ve been waiting for
