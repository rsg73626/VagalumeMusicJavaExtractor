GIVE ME YOUR LOVE

Just like an old time movie 
You left a trace away down low 
In every breath I think of you 
So many words I could say 
Something to bring your guard down low 
So much to gain, nothing to lose 
Take a chance, in romance, it can only just happen tonight 
Don't close your eyes, its all I want, its all I need 

Chorus: 
Love, love, give me your love 
Once, twice, give me your love 
Its all I want, its all I need 

Anticipation setting, my head is spinning with regrets 
I should have done this long before 
Just be wide open to me 
Give me the chance i'm looking for 
And i will promise not to lose 
Take a chance, in romance, it can only just happen tonight 
Don't close your eyes, its all I want, its all I need 

Chorus (2x) 

Take a chance, in romance, it can only just happen tonight 
Don't close your eyes, its all I want, its all I need 

Chours (2x)
