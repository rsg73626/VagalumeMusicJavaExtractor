ONLY IN THE NIGHT

It's late, its dark, and you surrender to a world without control
They sing, the shout, they dance together to the music in your soul
They can tell you, they can show you, the dreams inside your mind
It's you and me, what does it mean
Is what they say to you, is what they say to me

Chorus:
Only in the night, when you start romancing its inside your mind
Only in the night, you get to take that chance, it's only in the night

You think you see a multitude of people standing right outside your door
Looked in again, you couldn't run to mother 'cause she matches who you are
It's every game and every face that looks inside your mind
The fear is there, what do you care
Is what they say to you, is what they say to me

Chorus
Into the night (4x)

It's late, it's dark, and you surrender to a world without control
They talk to you, they talk to me
Is what they say to you, is what they say to me

Chorus
