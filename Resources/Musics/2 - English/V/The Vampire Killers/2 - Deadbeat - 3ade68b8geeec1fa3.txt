DEADBEAT

I’m dropping out
no college in the future for me
And I’m leaving home just as soon as I turn sixteen

I’m gonna be a drug addict deadbeat
Only prison awaits me
No six figures in my future only jail terms

I’ll die poor and lonely
or maybe I’ll just get killed first
by some gang member who’s my homie
or perhaps some fellow prisoner

I’ll give drugs to little girls
my gift is hepatitis to the world
Better tell them to watch out for me cause I’m a deadbeat
I’ll be a deadbeat
