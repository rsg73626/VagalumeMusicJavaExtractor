A VISION FOR PEPE

Doing pushups every morning doesn’t make you a man
Giving kids your violent warnings doesn’t mean you understand

that you can punch my nose
you can break my ribs
but can you really tell me how to use my head?

Just because you have a six-pack doesn’t mean that I am weak
Just because you can wrestle doesn’t mean that you can speak.

You can punch my nose
you can break my ribs
But can you live?
