KERR

Picks up his ak-47
puts on his red beret
Knows the masses give him the advantage Shouts death to the USA

Suburban guerilla the teenage resistor
He will never give up but he calls his oppressors ma’am or mister

His backpack filled with Maoist pamphlets
Gets ready for his toy journey
Ready to fight against oppression
As long as it’s only on TV

Suburban guerilla
He’s fighting the power
He’s ready to die for you
But he’s shooting flowers

He’ll seize control and the world will know his name/When he finds time to drop the video games
