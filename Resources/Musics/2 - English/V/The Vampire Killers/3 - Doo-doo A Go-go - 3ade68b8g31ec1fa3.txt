DOO-DOO A GO-GO

brushed my hair right
it’s blocking my eyes
I’ve got my pants tight
it’s cutting off my circulation
Got seven belts on
my buckle’s custom made
I bought my t-shirt from
a thrift store in East Chase

Here is a picture of me last weekend
Here is a picture of me lying on my bed
Here is a picture of me in the bathroom
Here is a picture of me taking a doo doo Taking a doo doo

Look at this picture
What color are my eyes?
Vintage shades
and a vintage mind
I’ve got a piece of paper
with your name on it
A heart afterwards would go just fine
Here is a picture of me burning incense
Here is a picture of me blowing kisses
Here is a picture of me not quite naked
Here is a picture of me and my cleavage
Here is a picture of me at my friend’s house
Here is a picture of me at my other friend’s house
Here is a picture of me in the swimming pool
Here is a picture of me don’t I look cool?
Don’t I look cool?
