ORTHODONTIST ROCK

My orthodontist is a pretty nice person
But you shouldn’t be like her
When you graduate from high school make sure you tell your parents
That you’re not going to auburn

Oh baby i love you so
But there’s one thing you should know
You could say anything to me
Except that you’re gonna go to auburn university

Please pretty white girls don’t be grow up to be
A charming business wife whose kids go to trinity
Don’t live in sturbridge and don’t drive a suv
In short don’t go to auburn university

Oh baby i love you so
But there’s one thing you should know
You could say anything to me
Except that youre gonna go to auburn university

You’ll drive a white suburban
Your husband will earn six figures
And mexicans will cut your lawn
You’ll have a son named cooper
And a daughter named lacey
In fact you might even be happy

Until your husband comes home late at night, and you stab him and you eat him...

Oh baby i love you so
But there’s one thing you should know
You could say anything to me
Except that you’re gonna go to auburn university
