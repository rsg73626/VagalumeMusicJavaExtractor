ROY MOORE IS GONNA BE MY GOVERNOR

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor
There is a church in my future
Pick up that holy book
God ain’t dead but the Pope’s a crook
Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor
Tonight is the establishment clause’s last supper
Move that big rock up the street
from the Supreme Court to the governor’s seat
Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor
He’ll get me a wife and ill love her
He’ll make sure I’m not gay
but if I am there’s hell to pay
Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Roy Moore is gonna be my governor

Please sign my bible
Please give me your holy gavel
Who judges who?
