RICH PEOPLE

So you’re the American dream
you’re an entrepreneurial robot machine You’ve franchised your soul but it’s all good, you’ve kicked out a whole neighborhood

Get out
You’re just a rich man
here you cant buy friends
you’re just a CEO
hurry up and go
you’re just a rock star
you just sell sports cars
you’re just a business man
you’re standing on quicksand

There’s nothing that you cant sell
even the ticket to your own hell
Fuck everyone over and call it success
Roll in all-American excess

Get out
You’re just a drug addict
money is your fix
take your money with you
you cant sell your soul here
you’re just a vampire
you’re part of the empire
