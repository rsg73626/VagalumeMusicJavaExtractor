DRIVE FASTER

I work hard all week at a dead end job
But when the weekend comes
I wanna have some fun
Run every red light drive all through the night

We were cruisin' down main
Just me and the boys
When I saw her face I had to make a choice
I said, "whoever you are, come on get in my car"

And let's drive drive drive till we get enough
We're gonna ride ride ride till the sun comes up
Gotta feel that wind blowing in her hair
And she's mine when I drive faster
Drive faster, drive faster, drive faster

We made every turn sitting side by side
Made the highway burn
Her little hand in mine
She whispered in my ear, "let's get outta here"
