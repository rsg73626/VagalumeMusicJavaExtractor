COUNTDOWN

Take a place with us
On this super song
Move by this rocky Rhythm 
Just go run away
Telling up yourself
No matter what your parents yell
C’mon (x3)
Move it
C’mon (x3)
Jump Out
C’mon (x3)
Let’s do it

(Chorus)
1 2 c’mon get laugh
3 4 dream it out
5 c’mon everyone
1 2 do what you want
3 4 on your way
5 Countdown to success

Dancing on your feet
All the girls are here
Ready to explode out (oh)
Maybe now’s the time
To scream aloud
And forget all the fears that you had…
C’mon (x3)
Just dream it
C’mon (x3)
Wake up
C’mon (x3)
Spin it

(Chorus)
1 2 c’mon get laugh
3 4 dream it out
5 c’mon everyone
1 2 do what you want
3 4 on your way
5 Countdown to success

Now
Don’t be afraid of what everyone can say
Just be in the dance floor
Express yourself
Be on your way
This is your life
You can live it like you want
So
C’mon
Jump out
Spin out
Let it out
Live your life
This is what is all about…

(Chorus)
1 2 c’mon get laugh
3 4 dream it out
5 c’mon everyone
1 2 do what you want
3 4 on your way
5 Countdown to success…

1 2 c’mon get laugh
3 4 dream it out
5 c’mon everyone
1 2 do what you want
3 4 on your way
5 Countdown to success

Yeah yeah
Yeah do what you want
Just scream aloud
1,2
5 4 3 2 1
