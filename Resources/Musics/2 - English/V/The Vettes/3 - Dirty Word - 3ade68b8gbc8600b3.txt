DIRTY WORD

On the tip of the tip of my tongue
Got a bad taste in my mouth
On the tip of the tip of my tongue
But I just can't spit it out
What are we a weak parody
On my own reality show?
Too afraid pushing me away
Now you're letting me go, letting me

You make love a dirty word
A dirty word, you're never gonna get it
You make love a dirty word
A dirty word, make me wanna bite your tongue
You lie, you lie in the bed you made
All by, by yourself again
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't say anything
To you it's just a dirty word but it's real to me

Give a little then you take it away
Just enough to keep me around
Give a little then you take it away
Like a shotgun coming out of your mouth
You're so cold you're making me numb
You're so cold we're over and done
Get it straight I'm not gonna wait
So I'm letting you go, letting you go

You make love a dirty word
A dirty word, you're never gonna get it
You make love a dirty word
A dirty word, make me wanna bite your tongue
You lie, you lie in the bed you made
All by, by yourself again
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't say anything
To you it's just a dirty word but it's real to me

Should have known this would end up tragic
Couldn't see through the noise and static
Is it love or only habit? oh.. oh.. oh
Can you give me one reason
Why we should keep repeating
The same old words when they mean nothing, nothing?

You make love a dirty word
A dirty word, you're never gonna get it
You make love a dirty word
A dirty word, make me wanna bite your tongue
You lie, you lie in the bed you made
All by, by yourself again
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't say anything
To you it's just a dirty word but it's real to me
