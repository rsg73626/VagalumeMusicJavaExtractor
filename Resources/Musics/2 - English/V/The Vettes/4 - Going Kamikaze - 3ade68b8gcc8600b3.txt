GOING KAMIKAZE

Everywhere I go
I feel so singled out
Grab onto every word
Coming out my mouth
Status update... Please
So original you stole that line from a show you smooth criminal

It's time for a celebration
It's for the masses' stimulation
This is out of control
I want my money back
I want my money back
Oh And I'm not coming back!

I'm going to Tokyo
Cause I'm huge in Japan
I gotta get out, oh
There's no time to pretend
I'm not usual, I am not delusional
I'm going kamikaze
Somebody try and stop me

I feel like a refugee
Been there done that
I even got the tee
I think I hate this place
I swear I'll run away

I'm going to Tokyo
Cause I'm huge in Japan
I gotta get out, oh
There's no time to pretend
I'm not usual, I am not delusional
I'm going kamikaze
Somebody try and stop me

Huge in Japan, Huge in Japan
Huge in Japan Huge in Japan
Somebody try and stop me

I'm going to Tokyo
Cause I'm huge in Japan
I gotta get out, oh
There's no time to pretend
I'm not usual, I am not delusional
I'm going kamikaze
Somebody try and stop me
