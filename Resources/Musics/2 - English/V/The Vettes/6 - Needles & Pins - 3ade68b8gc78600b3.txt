NEEDLES & PINS

12 O' Clock wake up call
Where to go when it's all over
Broken bones trophy scars
Pictures I cannot remember
Bullet Proof when it breaks
We'll just buy a new one
Cut in line join the fold
So much easier to follow

Here we are now after the show
All dressed up with no where to go
One by one we all fit in we're all stuck together 
with needles & pins
We're just like numbers, just like numbers 
oh... oh... oh... oh... oh

Are we strong? Are we weak?
Are we fighting for the same thing?
Knock me out fast asleep
Don't wake me til it's over
Will we dance? Will we sing?
Is there anybody watching?
What's the point if no one sees?
Did it really even happen?

Here we are now after the show
All dressed up with no where to go
One by one we all fit in we're all stuck together 
with needles  pins
We're just like numbers, just like numbers oh... oh... oh...

Get your money out, a-oh a-oh
We can work it out, we can work it out
When you're feeling down, a-oh a-oh
We can work it out, we can work it out
Just take a number, just take a number

One by one we all fit in 
we're all stuck together with needles & pins
One by one we all fit in just like numbers

Here we are now after the show
All dressed up with no where to go
One by one we all fit in 
we're all stuck together with needles & pins
We're just like numbers, just like numbers oh... oh... oh... oh... oh
