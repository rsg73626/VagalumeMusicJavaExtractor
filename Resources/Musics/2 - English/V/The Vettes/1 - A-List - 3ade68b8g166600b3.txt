A-LIST

It's been a few days and a few nights
Since I confessed my sins
Teenage prom queen
Little miss everything
Loneliest girl you'll ever see
California dreamin tonight
Moving to the city gonna be a starlet
I'm gonna be a star, I'm gonna be a star

Fall in so fast
It's so hot under these lights

A-list A-list I wanna be famous
Sex and drugs and hollywood
Chew you up and spit you out
A-list A-list I wanna be famous
Sex and drugs and hollywood
Chew you up and spit you out I cry

It's been a few days and a few nights
I don't know what day it is
Life in the fast lane
You crash harder, you crash harder
I'm losing my religion tonight
A razor's edge and a loaded gun
God save me

I'm falling so fast
It's so hot under these lights

A-list A-list I wanna be famous
Sex and drugs and hollywood
Chew you up and spit you out
A-list A-list I wanna be famous
Sex and drugs and hollywood
Chew you up and spit you out

I feel so alone
Trying to find my way back home
This is do or die
Have the rest of my life

A-list A-list I wanna be famous
Sex and drugs and hollywood
Chew you up and spit you out
A-list A-list I wanna be famous
Sex and drugs and hollywood
Chew you up and spit you out I cry
