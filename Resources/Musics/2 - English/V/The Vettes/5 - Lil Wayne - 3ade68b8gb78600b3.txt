LIL WAYNE

Here we are acting hard with our beats in a box
22's Gucci shoes I know you like what we got
I know  you want it, I know you want it so bad

Make a time, bring the rhymes we left a hole in the track
We'll feed the beat and take the heat
We want the Carter back
You know I need it, yeah you've got more than enough
Oh do you feel it? You've got the magic touch

Hey Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Come and lend us your name
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Come and save us from the ordinary, the ordinary world

Riding low Hollygrove yeah it's hot on the block
Flip a switch blow a kiss man
It must be a cop
It's so pathetic
He don't have nothing me

You took the fall they blamed it all on a celebrity
They took your freedom
But they'll never take away the dream
It's so vanilla without you around
We need an anthem
Coming to bust you out

Hey Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Come and lend us your name
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Always making it rain
We need an anthem
Coming to bust you out
Hey Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Come and save us from the ordinary, the ordinary world

Lil Wayne you're more like a state of mind
The city's standing still while you do your time
I wrote a letter but it came back to the sender unread
Am I crazy or just sick in the head?

Hey Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Come and lend us your name
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Always making it rain
We need an anthem
Coming to bust you out
Hey Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Come and save us from the ordinary, the ordinary world
