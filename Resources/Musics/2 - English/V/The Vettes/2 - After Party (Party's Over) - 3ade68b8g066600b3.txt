AFTER PARTY (PARTY'S OVER)

Hey hey all the boys are gay
But they love me anyway
Just make your way make your way to the dance floor
Here's one for the end of the night
When it's closing time and I need a ride
The city lights are getting dimmer, so much dimmer
Let's watch the sun rise

The party's over, the party's over (for you)
Party's over o-o-over
Party's over the party's over (for you)
The after party's just begun

It's nights like tonight you never wanna forget
Night's like tonight you never want em to end
Hit rewind and you play it again
Play it again, p-p-play it again

We gonn watch the sunrise

Party's over, the party's over (for you)
Party's over o-o-over
Party's over the party's over (for you)
The after party's just begun

The Party's not over
Party's not over
We gonn live it up
And watch the sun come
The after party's just begun

We're taking this one to the house
Tonight won't be forgotten
Live life with no regrets
There are no second chances
We fall and we get back up
We gonn party til the sun comes up
The party's over, the party's over
The after party's just begun

Party's over, the party's over (for you)
Party's over o-o-over
Party's over the party's over (for you)
The after party's just begun
The Party's not over
Party's not over
We gonn live it up
And watch the sun come
The after party's just begun
