THERE'S NOTHING LEFT

I went to school to get a degree
I saw a life that wasn't for me
I tried and tried - look what I get

There is nothing left

I wanna be happy I can't succeed
9 to 5 stripped life from me
Days become years, where have they went?

There is nothing left

I look to tomorrow, what do I see?
So much opportunity, but none of it's for me
All these fu*king faces, all of them tell lies
This is your America look through your country's eyes

There is nothing
There is nothing
There is nothing left
