VICIOUS RUMORS

I hear the people that keep talking sh*t
Too many lies about my friends
I don't remember seeing you back then,
Guess what
You won't be there in the end

You had your change
I lost my tolerance
And you're to blame
I'm sick of all these games

And the gossip still goes on and on
These punks sure have a lot to say
Sit in front of the computer screen 
All night!
We never see them anyway

You had your change
I lost my tolerance
And you're to blame
I'm sick of all these games
