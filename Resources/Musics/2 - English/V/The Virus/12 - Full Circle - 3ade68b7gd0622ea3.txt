FULL CIRCLE

Do you ever feel like you can't do nothing right?
Feeling so repetitive as your days turn to nights
You're organized, you had it straight - you watched it collapse
Stuck inside this fu*king game where nothing seems to match

I live my life in circles
I run around in circles

I live my life - full circle
I run around - full circle
I live my life - full circle
I'm wasting my life circling around

You bit the bullet cause you thought you gave it all you got
The people that you knew and loved left you to rot
You fought and fought refusing to give in
Stuck inside a pointless game you know you can't win

I live my life in circles
I run around in circles

I live my life - full circle
I run around - full circle
I live my life - full circle
I'm wasting my life circling around

Everyday I wake up and go to the same shitty job with the same dead beat boss for the same low wages. 
Too tall, too fat, too ugly, that's who I am. 
She's the only girl I ever truly loved until she met him. 
80 thousand dollars for an education and they say sorry kid you don't have enough experience. 
You can be whatever you want when you grow up?
Why me, why does this always happen to me? 
Did you see how much they took out of my paycheck, how am I going to pay these bills? 
America only promises you the pursuit of happiness, not the chance to get it.

All those times you told me what to do
As nothing changed I thought maybe I'm the fool
I stand alone but I'm still coming back
I played your game and now I'm back on track

I live my life - full circle
I run around - full circle
I live my life - full circle
I'm wasting my life circling around
