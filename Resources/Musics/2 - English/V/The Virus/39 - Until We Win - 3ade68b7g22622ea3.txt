UNTIL WE WIN

We are the punks and you are the bastards
Try and slow us down we'll just go faster 
Keep up the pace and never give in
Cause we'll keep on fighting 
Until we win 

We are the future we are the youth
We get condemned for telling the truth

With one common goal we stand and we strive
To keep our ideals and to keep punk alive
Keep your own ideas and never give in
Cause we'll keep on fighting 
Until we win 

We are the future we are the youth
We get condemned for telling the truth
