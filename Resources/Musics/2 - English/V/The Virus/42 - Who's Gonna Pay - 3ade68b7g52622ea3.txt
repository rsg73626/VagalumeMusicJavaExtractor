WHO'S GONNA PAY

Next thing you know your a slave
Can you feel the tension on the rise?
Do you hear the people's silent cries?
Kids trying to grab the American dream
The one they see on the T.V. screen
Spend half you life behind a f**king desk
Strain mind learn the f**king text
Do what your told and learn these f**king rules
Cause you'll be nothing if you don't go to school

Lies presented and taught as a fact
Taught how to think and how to act
Be responsible and obey
Next thing you know your a slave

Who's Gonna pay for their lies?
Who's gonna pay for their lies?
Not me

Their mission is clear it is to control
They'll sell your body, mind, and then your soul
You better act or you will be a slave
You better think or you will be a slave
So before you believe what you are told
Make sure these facts aren't part of the mold
Make up your mind to truly be free
Create your world and your own destiny

Lies presented and taught as a fact
Taught how to think and how to act
Be responsible and obey
Next thing you know your a slave

Who's Gonna pay for their lies?
Who's gonna pay for their lies?
Not me

Can you feel the tension on the rise?
Do you hear the people's silent cries?
Kids trying to grab the American dream
The one they see on the T.V. screen
Spend half you life behind a f**king desk
Half a life, behind a desk
Strain mind learn the text
Strain mind learn the text
Do what your told and learn these f**king rules
Learn these f**king rules 
Cause you'll be nothing if you don't go to school
If you don't go to school

Lies presented and taught as a fact
Taught how to think and how to act
Be responsible and obey

Who's Gonna pay for their lies?
Who's gonna pay for their lies?
Not me
