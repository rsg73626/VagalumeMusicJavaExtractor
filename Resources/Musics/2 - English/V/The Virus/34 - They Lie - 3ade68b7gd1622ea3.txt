THEY LIE

The capitalists and communists - they lie, they lie
The activists and pacifists - they lie, they lie
The Media and their social cliques - they lie, they lie
In Education and politics - they lie, they lie

They hold us down as children and they force into schools
They force to obey the laws and then they break the rules
They lie about the wars, about the names, about the places
They lie about our country and they lie right to our faces

Leaders and religious fools - they lie, they lie
Preachers and the know it alls - they lie, they lie
Police and military rule - they lie, they lie
Conservatives and liberals too - they lie, they lie

They hold us down as children and they force into schools
They force to obey the laws and then they break the rules
They lie about the wars, about the names, about the places
They lie about our country and they lie right to our faces

The pigs that live in Washington - they lie, they lie
Wasting time in the U.N. - they lie, they lie
The shows you watch the books you read - they lie, they lie
Controlling everything you need - they lie
