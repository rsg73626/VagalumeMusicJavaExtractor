TAKE CONTROL

Keep all those bastards from holding you down
Gotta stand tall to keep off the ground
Don't let them keep you from getting ahead
Cause if they get their way we'll all end up dead

Gotta stand tall... Take Control
Soon you will fall... Take Control
Then I'll get ahead... Take Control
I won't end up dead.. Take Control

Cause just like you no one means s**t to me
When I look around hell is all that I see
I do what I can to take control of my life
Cause we owe ourselves to live our lives right

Gotta stand tall... Take Control
Soon you will fall... Take Control
Then I'll get ahead... Take Control
I won't end up dead.. Take Control

Just take control
There's no control

Take control

Keep all those bastards from holding you down
Gotta stand tall to keep off the ground
Don't let them keep you from getting ahead
Cause if they get their way we'll all end up dead

Gotta stand tall... Take Control
Soon you will fall... Take Control
Then I'll get ahead... Take Control
I won't end up dead.. Take Control
