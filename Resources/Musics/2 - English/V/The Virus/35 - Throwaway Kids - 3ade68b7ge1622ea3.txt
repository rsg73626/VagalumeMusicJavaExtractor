THROWAWAY KIDS

When you have nothing and life is ripping at the seems
You watch your hope and pride just go slipping with your dreams
Everything you knew and loved means nothing to you now
When no one's around

Cause this an anthem for the kids out on the streets 
Throwaway kids
Who haven't got no money and have nothing left to eat
Throwaway kids
Broken hearts and broken homes will be sure to get you down
Fight, fight
But nevertheless the world keeps spinning around

Realize the biggest lie they told you was love
Though life might seem hopeless it's not a curse from above
When you feel no connection to the people out on the street
Just getting by seems like an impossible feat

Cause this an anthem for the kids out on the streets
Throwaway kids
Who haven't got no money and have nothing left to eat
Throwaway kids
Broken hearts and broken homes will be sure to get you down
Fight, fight
But nevertheless the world keeps spinning around
