PEACE OF MIND

Hardest thing for me in life
Is to find some peace of mind
Some surround themselves with wealth
That only makes them blind

Every person has a choice
You make yours and I'll make mine

Why should people live their lives
To other's expectations
Just makes you feel inadequate
And filled full of frustration

Is it really such a crime
I just want some peace of mind

Some look in a bottle
Others simply go to church
Or enter institutions
In the never ending search

I might end up going crazy
Just to get some peace of mind
