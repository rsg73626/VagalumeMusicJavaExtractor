TIME IS NOW

What'd you say you son of a bitch?
I won't play your games of which is which
There's too many rules and I won't be restricted
By these political games, no I won't fall victim

It's time to fight for what you believe in
If you know what I mean, then you know what you're missing
Now we ain't gonna live by your rules no more
But we gotta figure out what we're fighting for

Some kids today, well they don't know sh*t
There minds don't work and their ignorance fits
No use for any kind of education
Silver spoon in hand and their minds on vacation

It's time to fight for what you believe in
If you know what I mean, then you know what you're missing
Now we ain't gonna live by your rules no more
But we gotta figure out what we're fighting for

Ring wing, left wing each is wrong
Won't play these fu*king games where I never belong
I wanna learn learn to use my own mind
I'm not missing out, I'm not wasting my time.

It's time to fight for what you believe in
If you know what I mean, then you know what you're missing
Now we ain't gonna live by your rules no more
But we gotta figure out what we're fighting for
