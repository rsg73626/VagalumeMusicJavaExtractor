RATS IN THE CITY

I'm sick of feeling trapped when
I walk down this dirty city streets
I don't know what to do about
The rats under my fucking feet
There's no law anymore
These rats have settled the score
This city is overdue
The burdens left are me and you

Tell me what we going to do about
Rats in the city
Rats in the city
Rats in the city, Rats in my town
Rats in the city and I want to get out, get out
Rats in the city
Rats in the city and I want to get them out

Another day, another place
Another lonely woman's face
Another cop, another shot
Another fucked up kid is lost
I can't wait anymore
It's time we settle the score
This city belongs to me
These rats they own the streets - it's true

Tell me what we going to do about
Rats in the city
Rats in the city
Rats in the city, Rats in my town
Rats in the city and I want to get out, get out
Rats in the city
Rats in the city and I want to get them out
