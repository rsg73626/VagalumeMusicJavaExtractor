VISIONS

Society f**ks with my mind
Can this be the end of future time?
There is no tomorrow, none that I can see
There is no future for you and me

Stumbling into darkness, The future don't look bright
The clock is ticking faster, annihilation's getting near
Days are growing shorter, It's a matter time
Until there's a flash on the horizon as humanity dies....

I feel like sh*t every f**king day
Another price for me to pay
I'm living with a c*nt like you
Just what the f**k am I gonna do?

Stumbling into darkness, The future don't look bright
The clock is ticking faster, annihilation's getting near
Days are growing shorter, It's a matter time
Until there's a flash on the horizon as humanity dies....
