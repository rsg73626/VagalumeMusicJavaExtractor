MY LIFE MY WORLD

You do exactly what you want to
And you answer to no one
You live exactly how you want to
For you today has just begun

It's my life - I choose to
It's my life - so f**k you

Never surrender
It's my life and my world <i>[x4]

You always have to have your own way
So why would you want to change right now?
It's my life and I want to have my say
No one can tell me that, oh no

It's my life - I choose to
It's my life - so f**k you

Never surrender
It's my life and my world <i>[x4]

It's my world - I choose to
It's my life - so f**k you

Never surrender
It's my life and my world <i>[x4]
