DOG'S EYE VIEW

People they don't notice me
I blend into the crowd
Watch them play their social games
That make them feel so proud
Their looks seem incoherent
Their faces look like masks
Going through the motions
Yet no one stopped to ask

Is this really what I want
Or is this what I've been told
Is there someone pulling strings
Or am I in control?

They're always out there waiting
With their ignorance and greed
Forcefeeding me values
That I don't fucking need
Disgust and paranoia
Twist in me like a knife
I'm looking at this world
With a dog's eye view of life

You look at me as if I'm dirt
Some punk out of his mind
When I can see quite clearly
The things to which you're blind
