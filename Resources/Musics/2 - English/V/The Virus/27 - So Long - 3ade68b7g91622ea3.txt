SO LONG

You got exactly what you wanted
As you left your friends behind
I'll catch you around-  
I'll see you later - I say  So Long
Why bother wasting all my time?

To all the people who denied me - So long, So long
And kept me one step behind - So Long
How long did you think you could lie to me - So Long, So Long
I saw through you one last time - So Long

All those times that it was me and you
And we we're always hanging out
You think it's my fault that you changed -
I say So Long
I finally know what you're about

What the fuck did you just say to me - So Long, So Long
You never liked me anyway - So Long
Now the truth seems to be coming out - So Long, So Long
It's getting better everyday - So Long

What you want to do?
I can see right thru you
I let you have your say
Who are you anyway?

What the fuck did you just say to me - So Long, So Long
You never liked me anyway - So Long
Now the truth seems to be coming out - So Long, So Long
It's getting better everyday - So Long

Here we are it's just me and you
I never said it be the same
Times have changed
All I want to say is - So Long
I guess some friendships are in vain

Think exactly what you to think - So Long, So Long
All your thoughts are lies - So Long
There's nothing more you can say to me - So Long, So Long
I guess this is goodbye - So Long
