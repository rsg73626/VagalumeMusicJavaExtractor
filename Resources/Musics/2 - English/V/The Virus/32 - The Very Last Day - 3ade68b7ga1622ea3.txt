THE VERY LAST DAY

I can't say Where I've been
What I've done or what I've seen
But no one needs to walk this lonely road
All my life never tried
Left alone with all my lies
Empty hearts became my only home

If nothings changed
Then I'm to blame
It all feels the same The very last day
I made this bed
I'm gonna lie in it
It all feels the same The very last day
The very last day

One more bag - one more hit
One more time and then I'll quit
Everyday it gets a little worse
All my friends - ones I loved
Cut me loose and cut me off
When your thrown off the tracks it f**king hurts

If nothings changed
Then I'm to blame
It all feels the same The very last day
I made this bed
I'm gonna lie in it
It all feels the same The very last day
The very last day
