KEEP WALKING

When I stumble and start to fall,
I take a look at the flyers up on my wall.
I think of what my life's become.
All the things that I have seen.
All the things that I have done.

My friends they carry me along.
When they grow tired that's when I get strong.
And everyone that tried to hold us down
My friends and I we pull each other
Up off the ground.

We keeping on walking, not alone
We keeping on walking, one day you're gonna be strong
We keep on... we keep on
Walking on

My friends they carry me along.
When they grow tired that's when I get strong.
And everyone that tried to hold us down
My friends and I we pull each other
Up off the ground.

We keeping on walking, not alone
We keeping on walking, one day you're gonna be strong
We keep on... we keep on
Walking on
