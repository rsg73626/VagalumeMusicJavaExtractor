NO WAR CAN BE WON

Training children, trained to kill
Teaching hatred, no free will
Breeding perfect killing machines
(You greedy f**king bastards)
Fathers take them on the hunt
Video games of gore and blood
Desensitizing them loss of life

For the sake of future children
No war No war can be one

Just like they learn from T.V.
Movies, games, and history
He who kills the most is the biggest man
(You're never gonna win)
When little boys have little guns
Little tanks and little bombs
Training them to kill from day one

For the sake of future children
No war No war can be one

For scholarship will you sell your soul?
Killing babies while on patrol
What's the price of innocent lives?
(You're killing f**king children)
Too much, too much human greed
In a fire storm of hell we lead
The next evolution's extinction
(And who will pay the price?)

For the sake of future children
No war No war can be one
