RHETORIC

What do they expect to change
With a boring rhetoric
Spouting words with cheap concern
Complacent loads of shit
Who is this fucking idiot
Telling me that it's alright
Just to ease his guilty conscience
Of being middle class and white

Expect another Democrat
To bail us from this shit?
Soften up the left's ideas
And try to make them fit
It's gone beyond the point
That politics can help
The framework that you live in
is a problem in itself
