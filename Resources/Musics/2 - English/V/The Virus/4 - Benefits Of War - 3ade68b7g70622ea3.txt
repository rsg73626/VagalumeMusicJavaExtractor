BENEFITS OF WAR

I read in the paper that war makes a better today
It's seems to be raising cost but not raising the wage
Its creating new jobs but what's the real price,
Opening the slots by  taking a live
Its doesn't seem to be getting better to me

What's real the rumors or the threat - The benefits of war
What goals have secretly been set - The benefits of war
No loss and no gain - The benefits of war
The rich and the poor are never the same - The benefits of war

Now I have to support a war economy
Campaigning to help a new enemy
To start another war to combat recession,
which is only caused by the senate's decision
How does this make it better for me?

What's real the rumors or the threat - The benefits of war
What goals have secretly been set - The benefits of war
No loss and no gain - The benefits of war
The rich and the poor are never the same - The benefits of war
