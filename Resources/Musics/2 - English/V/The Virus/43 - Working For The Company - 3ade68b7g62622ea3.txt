WORKING FOR THE COMPANY

Wake up in the morning 
Go push to get paid
Don't mind the work
But to the grind you're a slave
While other people prosper
You got to survive
You got a wife
You got kids
Unemployment's on the rise

I won't work for the company
But unemployment's going to kill me
Unemployment
Unemployment

So you work for the company
See what you can get 
Thirty years have past
You haven't seen nothing yet
Held up your end of the deal
Did what you could do
Forty years gone by
There's nothing for you

I won't work for the company
But unemployment's going to kill me
Unemployment
Unemployment

Why work for the company?
No one will work for the company
I won't work for the company, NO!
