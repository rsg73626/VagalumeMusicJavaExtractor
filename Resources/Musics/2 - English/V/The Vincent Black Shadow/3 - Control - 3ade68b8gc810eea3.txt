CONTROL

This time the glove is latex 
This time the suit is white 
New life has found a place 
It's laid eggs in someone's eye 

Would I still want control? 
Even when you don't? 

Your skin's a lot like plastic 
Some kind of bad disguise 
Transfusing blood for paper 

So sweet, you're drawing flies 

I want control 

Even when you don't 
Would I still want control? (3x) 

Even when. 
Even when you 
Even when you 
Even when 
you don't? 
Control, control, control
