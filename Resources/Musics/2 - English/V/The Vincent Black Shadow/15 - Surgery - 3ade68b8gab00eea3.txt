SURGERY

'Now's the time for you' 
He said 
'To open up so I can see' 
He cut a piece 
Of skin for me 
I never had to wait in line 
He never seemed to know it was me 
As he stood over me 
Wide awake and clenching his teeth' 
I thought 
Maybe 
Just maybe it was time to see a new doctor 
Caked all over 
What a mess
