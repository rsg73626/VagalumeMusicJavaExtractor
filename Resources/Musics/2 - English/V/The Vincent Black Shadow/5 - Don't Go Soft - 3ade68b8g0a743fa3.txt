DON'T GO SOFT

Barely a secret
Rusted metal
Anxiously
Too sick to fix it
Hope the lock fits
With her key


And there's just one more thing
To fake before you go
I'll stare at you
You'll stare at me
And fill my hand
With pins and needles


Don't go soft on breaking my heart
Don't go soft on breaking my heart
You're like rust
I'm falling apart


Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight


Blunt
So you mean it
Slice it even
Just to see
What shades the middle
Was it faded
With disease


And there's just one more thing
To fake before you go
I'll stare at you
You'll stare at me
And fill my hand
With pins and needles


Don't go soft on breaking my heart
Don't go soft on breaking my heart
You're like rust
I'm falling apart


Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight


There's just one more thing
To fake before you go
I'll stare at you
You'll stare at me
And fill my hand
With pins and needles


Don't go soft on breaking my heart
Don't go soft on breaking my heart
You're like rust
I'm falling apart
You're like rust
I'm falling apart

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight (oh...)
Tonight (oh...)
Tonight (oh...)
Tonight (oh...)
