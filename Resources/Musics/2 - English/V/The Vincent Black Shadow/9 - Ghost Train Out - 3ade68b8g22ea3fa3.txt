GHOST TRAIN OUT

Pack your bags and leave tonight
Can't you see
That there's something not quite right
My doors are locked tonight

You wanna run?
I thought you might

There's a train that stops for no one
There's a train that leaves tonight

And I said
Maybe, baby baby
Come on
Come on
You'll be alright

And I said
Baby you can do no wrong
Come on
You'll be alright

Please don't look at me that way
If I could
I would leave so you could stay
I live without your face
It's drawn in flesh
It's drawn in haste

He's the one who looked just like you
He's the one who'll take your place tonight

And I said
Maybe, baby baby
Come on
Come on
You'll be alright

And I said
Baby you can do no wrong
Come on
You'll be alright

Just remember
You'll be alright
Just remember
You're safe tonight
Just remember
There was no choice
For you

And I said
Baby baby baby
Come on (come on)
You'll be alright

And I said
Baby you can do no wrong
Come on
You'll be alright
