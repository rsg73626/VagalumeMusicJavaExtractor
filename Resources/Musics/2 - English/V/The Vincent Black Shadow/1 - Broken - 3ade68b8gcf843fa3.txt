BROKEN

I will be broken
Oh oh oh

Seven hours passed on your floor
Like nothing's wrong
When they finally broke down the door
I heard that song

But you always said
You’d give it up
You’d give it up
Oh oh oh
You always said
You’d give it up
You’d give it up
You’d give it

I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will be broken
Oh oh oh


Seven hours isn’t that long
To wonder why
Didn’t even pick up the phone
To say goodbye


But you always said
You’d give it up
You’d give it up
Oh oh oh
You always said
You’d give it up
You’d give it up
You’d give it


I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will be broken
In what you have spoken


But you always said
You’d give it up
You’d give it up
Oh oh oh
You always said
You’d give it up
You’d give it up
You’d give it

I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will...

I will be broken
In what you have spoken
I will...
