DREAM

Blew the dust off a wooden box 
And set it on the piano 
Nasty words came from its mouth 
The bite marks were to follow 
I should have given it away 
Now I never dream 
Wide awake for much too long 
My eyes glued to the table 
Tried to feign authority 
But sadly wasn't able 
And then it threw me to the floor 
I never dream 
They say I'm late by half a century 
He died in 1943 
I can't just leave 
(He smells it when I'm gone) 
So I just take it in my sleep 
The road is going' 
Me: 'Ask for her another day' 
The spade's up your sleeve 
There's sweat on your brow 
And I will be damned 
If I let you back into this town 
December 17th, 1955 - Broken 
Seven hours passed on your floor 
Seven hours isn't that long 
Seven hours isn't
