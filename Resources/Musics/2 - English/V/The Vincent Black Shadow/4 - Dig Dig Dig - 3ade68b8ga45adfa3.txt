DIG DIG DIG

I had a feeling it wasn't real
but the hole that it left followed me from the dreaming
The ground was moving
the fog was deep and my voice was inside and it told me a secret

Dig Dig Dig till my eyes cant see
I still get through and i still don't breath
All this hope and there's a hole in I
and I have to get to the other side
I dig through it and my skin turns thick
I borrow winds to the dirt in grit
In my shape it was in my shape
and yours too

I have a feeling
You wont believe when I tell you the truth
'Cause the truth isn't easy
Why cant you see it?
Its like a shadow of you on the wall
and its waiting and its breathing

Dig Dig Dig till my eyes cant see
I still slip through and i still don't bleed
On this slope there's a hole and
I have to get my self inside
Telling you that its the truth
i have to do this is my shadow and i see yours too
It's wait there for you it needs to frame you

Climb in the hole and see
your so radiant cause your home
In your hole

Dig Dig Dig till my eyes cant see
I still slip through and i still don't bleed
On this slope there's a hole and
I have to get my self inside
Telling you that its the truth
i have to do this is my shadow and I see yours too
It's wait there for you it needs to frame you

Climb in your hole and see

I had a feeling it wasn't real
but the hole that is left followed me from the dreaming
The ground was moving
The fog was deep and my voice was inside and it told me a secret
