FEARS IN THE WATER

Little ones 
They scream like bunnies 
Probably something you 
Said about a faceless head 
A mirror locked in a room 
You wonder what it did 
There's a crack in the floor 
That wasn't there before 
I think it's looking at you 

Fears in the water 
Tapping on your shoulder 
Fears in the water 
Dragging down your daughter 
Fears in the water 
Brazen like a soldier 
Fears in the water 
Looking at you, oh 

REPEAT ALL 
You, oh 
You, oh 

Little Ones

Fears in the water 
Tapping on your shoulder 
Fears in the water 
Dragging down your daughter 
Fears in the water 
Brazen like a soilder 
Fears in the water 
Looking at you, oh 

Fears in the water 
Dragging down your daughter 
Fears in the water 
Looking at you
