IN A ROW

Your troop has landed
And you’re on the run
You’re out there stranded
You only got your gun

For peace and planet
You know it’s not for fun
You never planned it
You were not the one

This is not an old war story
Like they always told
This is a nightmare to behold

So in a row they line up to die
Breath in the air
For just one last time
And try to be strong
While their mothers cry
So in a row they line up to die

It seemed so easy
Cause life was hard
With hope so fleeting
You let down your guard
When you were younger
With hope and pride
Now in a place where
It’s kill or die

This is not an old war story
Like they always told
This is a nightmare to behold

So in a row they line up to die
Breath in the air
For just one last time
And try to be strong
While their mothers cry
So in a row they line up to die

Looking through my lens
I see him looking back at me
We both have no choice
It’s our destiny
Cause we both came to fight
And now we live in fear
Life will be cut short
Death is creeping near

This is not an old war story
Like they always told
This is a nightmare to behold

So in a row they line up to die
Breath in the air
For just one last time
And try to be strong
While their mothers cry
So in a row they line up to die
