STUPID INTRUDERS

Stupid intruders came and ruined an empty space
I don't know why I bother fronting a nice face,
it's fake
I took a test and found out things that I knew before
It's all genetic that I find you a huge bore

I won't pretend it's not a meat locker in this place
The stink is massive and it waters my eyes like mace
You need to read more and then maybe you'll be okay
But that's just science being dumb

Sitting on a chaise I'm catching information on this
stupid place
Maybe in another life I fought a war and had a hundred
wives
It’s not easy, they say it’s easy but I’d rather be stuck and roasted
I know that would please me
You don’t see me, you think you see me
But I’m rabid and hibernating
Simultaneously

Who are you to give me tips on me?
You don’t know me
And that’s the problem

A filthy breeder came and ruined an empty space
The things I say don’t really mean that much
I guess that’s okay
I took a train and saw a place I had been before
I saw the stars and ice and blades and a dead horse
I won’t pretend it’s not a meat locker in this place
I read the book I know the movie won’t be the same
How can a story fit inside such a tiny space
I know that metaphor was dumb
