DON'T MAKE ME SO MAD

If I knew that my time would be so short with you
And the water that ran out of erroded on your face pained me too
I dont think I'm right
And I know it's not fair
Maybe when im old
I'll be the first to
the first to feel it
and why I said nothing then
now you know

Dont make me so mad
dont make dont make me so me so mad
Dont make me so mad
dont make dont make me so me so mad
Dont make me so mad
dont make dont make me so me so mad
Dont make me so mad
dont make dont make me so me so mad

Its not fair, Its not fair
Its not fair, Oooh

If I wasn't do deep in the bad side of me
If my bones were alive and I'm ready for that slow in the head
Something went wrong [Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on]
But I wont say [Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on]
I know something went wrong [Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on]
that slow decayed [Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on]

And I dont think im right
and I know its not fair
I know your there so

Dont make me so mad

Dont make me so mad
dont make dont make me so me so mad
Dont make me so mad

Dont make me so mad
