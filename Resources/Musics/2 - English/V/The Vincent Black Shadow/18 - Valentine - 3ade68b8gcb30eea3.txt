VALENTINE

I want to be your valentine 
I want to spike your milk with wine 
I want to make the others cry 
With your fading shadow 
Promise you'll stay awake tonight 
When I load the barrel 
You!! 
Owe me another night!! 
A pony, a glass of wine 
If only 
Another night 
She canters backwards for miles
