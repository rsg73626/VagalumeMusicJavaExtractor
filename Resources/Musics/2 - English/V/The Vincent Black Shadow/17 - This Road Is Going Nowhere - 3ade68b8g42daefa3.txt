THIS ROAD IS GOING NOWHERE

Ah surprises caused by the sting of sight
between the good and the black and white of what you see
I feel a stranger coming onto me
I brought it on but I could never be the one to get to the point and shut up
As for another day
As for something worthe the price you have to pay

The stakes are up and your eyes are down
Step right up for another round
Theres fate up your sleeve
There's sweat on your brow
and I would be damned
If I let you back into this town

You describe intentions with an olive branch
You may be killing in a lot of fans except for me
They way you speak is contradictory
I know the lies, you told them back to me, why don't you get to the point and shut up?

As for another day
as for something worth the price you have to pay

The stakes are up and your eyes are down
Step right up for another round
Theres fate up your sleeve
There's sweat on your brow
and I would be damned
If I let you back into this town

As for another day
as for something worthe the price you have to pay

The stakes are up and your eyes are down
Step right up for another round
Step right up for another round
another round you're going nowwhere
The stakes are up and your eyes are down
Step right up for another round
another round
another round another town thats going nowwhere

Theres fate up your sleeve
There's sweat on your brow
and I will be damned
if I let you back into this town

Theres fate up your sleeve
There's sweat on your brow
and I will be damned
If I let you back into this town
