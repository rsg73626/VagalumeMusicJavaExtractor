THE BLACK TO COME

I feel it now from top to toe
This is gonna be my final run
Straight to death is where I go
I've come to swallow the sun
I feel it now in each and every bone

This is gonna be the final stand
Nothing´s left of what once sown
Now let us fuckin´ cheer the end
Dear dear end ' send your players and exit plans
End, dear dear end ' leave my prayers and tie my hands

Everybody´s sworn to zero
Watch out for the black to come
Everybody´s born a dying man
There it comes, there comes the black
I feel it now in each and every word

This is gonna be my final show
Everything has gone unheard
Until I kneel down to that world below
I feel it now in each and every breath

This is gonna be my final ride
I bide my time I starve for death
My rotten dreams and hopes aside
Everybody´s sworn to zero
Watch out for the black to come
Everybody´s born a dying man

There it comes, there comes the black
Everybody´s sworn to darkness
Watch out for the death to come
Everybody´s born a crying man
Here we go, here comes the black
