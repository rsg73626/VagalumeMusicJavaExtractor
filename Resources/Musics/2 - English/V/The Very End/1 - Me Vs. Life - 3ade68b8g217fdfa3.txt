ME VS. LIFE

I'm bleeding backwards, I´m ready to rot
A whole lotta nothing is all I´ve got
I'm breathing blades now, I´m ready to fight
A whole lotta black blood tells me I´m right

Burn down each one of them
Can't stand it no more
Burn down each one of them
Down to the core

I'm living backwards the days I forgot
A whole lotta darkness is all I´ve got
I'm tapping the vein now, I´m ready tonight
A whole lotta black tears tells me I´m right
Time has come, let´s twist the knife

I'm lying backwards, the word has been cut
A whole lotta sickness is all I´ve got
I'm done with all now, I´m ready to die

A whole lotta black mouths tell me I´m right
Time has come, let´s twist the knife
Now it is me versus life
