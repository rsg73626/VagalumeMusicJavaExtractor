THIS END

Back to zero, it´s dying night tonight
Back to zero, to life below the light
Shadows stalk right through my feverish veins
Between blood, sweat and tears the scythe is similing again

My obituary´s printed like the best news ahead
Damn deal done, I´m waking up dead
Another resurrection thrown down the drain
Between blood, sweat and tears the scythe is similing again

My obituary´s printed and will gladly been read
Damn deal done, I´m waking up dead
Back to zero, it´s crying night tonight
Back to zero, to life beyond all light

Give death a chance and for a while we´ll be sane
Between blood, sweat and tears the scythe is similing again
This end is eternal and it´s all we ever get

Damn deal done, I´m waking up dead
Dead  this end is without end
Dead  let´s all fucking die tonight
Dead  this is the very end

This end is without end
My time has come again
This end is without end, is without end
It´s without end
