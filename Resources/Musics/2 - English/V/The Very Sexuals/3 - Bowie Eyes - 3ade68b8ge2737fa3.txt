BOWIE EYES

Evil jacket on, spirit is high
it's an indoor revolution
still dream of the early times
girl, we had before the war

And you always stare the sun down
Down from my sky
And you always stare the sun down, down

And you always stare the sun down
Down from my sky
And you always stare the sun down, down

Evil icons and enemy fire
it's an artschool girl's solution
Godspeed with the demons your fight
girl, you know you're all I want

And you always stare the sun down
Down from my sky
And you always stare the sun down, down

This is our god and nation
we have to start a new creation
but the apples in your tree are not that tasty

And I want a star that guides me
to a girl with Bowie eyes
got visions of my glamrock idols saving me

This is our god and nation
we have to start a new creation
but the apples in your tree are not that tasty

And I want a star that guides me
to a girl with Bowie eyes
got visions of my glamrock idols saving me

This is our god and nation
we have to start a new creation
but the apples in your tree are not that tasty

And I want a star that guides me
to a girl with Bowie eyes
got visions of my glamrock idols saving me

This is our god and nation...
