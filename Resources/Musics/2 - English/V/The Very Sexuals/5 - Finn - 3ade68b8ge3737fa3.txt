FINN

With these metal hands we
pick you right up from the ground
we were happy, shameless
before Arnie came around
and the sound dies out now
and the sound dies out now
and the sound dies out now

On my hands, little burns
but you gave me life in return

Little mouths to feed here
mushroom clouds that draw near
boy meets girl and girl steals
his potential to be cruel
and the sound dies out now
and the sound dies out now
and the sound dies out now

On my hands, little burns
but you gave me life in return
On my hands, little burns
but you gave me life in return

Now it's scattered all around
this used to be a playground
with blocks and dolls and pencils
unaware of hassle
and the sound dies out now
and the sound dies out now
and the sound dies out
