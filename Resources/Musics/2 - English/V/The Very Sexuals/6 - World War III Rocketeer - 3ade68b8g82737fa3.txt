WORLD WAR III ROCKETEER

Hello future girl
you don't have to hide no more
it's the end of war

My sweet future girl
I saw you in the grocery store
you were looking

Like a polar star
sparkling through the air
like a polar star 
sparkling through the air

World war 3 rocketeer
I went into hiding, into a wintersleep
and you said that war was over
that you where my lover
and we were shining! 

Like a polar star 
sparkling through the air
like a polar star 
sparkling through the air

Hello future girl
you look so radiant, with your war-suit on
hello future girl
and I will love you beyond the end of time

and we are shining
like a polarstar
