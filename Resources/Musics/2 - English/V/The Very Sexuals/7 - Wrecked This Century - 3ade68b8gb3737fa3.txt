WRECKED THIS CENTURY

We've got the feeling like a 25 degree spring breeze 
Come on explore me and just ignore the scenery
Give me the year 2000 and I'll fuck it up well
they will never be able to tell, it was me

We've got sidewalks/pavements
or something in between
There are plenty of minds to 
prove your disbelief (wrong)

Give me the year 2000 and i'll make it bleed
they'll never know it was me

I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!

You rent a room, I'll blind it
you carve a heart, I'll find it
Give me a horse and I'll ride it
into the next century 

lalalalalalalala

I've got the feeling that my mind's a freakin' A-bomb!
But there are plenty of minds & there's plenty of time
give me the course of history and I'll fuck it up well
they will never be able to tell, it was me

I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!

You rent a room, I'll blind it
you carve a heart, I'll find it
give me a horse and I'll ride it
into the next century

You rent a room, I'll blind it
you carve a heart, I'll find it
give me a horse and I'll ride it
into the next century 

You treat me like a savage
draw eyes upon my eyelids
all you get is nothing
but a show of hands

I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!
I wrecked this century!
