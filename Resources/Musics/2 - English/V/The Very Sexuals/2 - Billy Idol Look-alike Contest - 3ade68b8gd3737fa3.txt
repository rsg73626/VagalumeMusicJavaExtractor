BILLY IDOL LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST

We've got shooting stars
and they light up the winding road
we sleep underneath the palm-trees
ocean waves, come and please me
ocean waves, come and go

We met on the evening of the Billy Idol look-alike contest
you looked so very pretty and hey, you looked exactly like him
We met on the evening of the Billy Idol look-alike contest
you looked so very pretty and hey, you looked exactly like him

Right down here lives the man
he breathes hellfire
we sleep underneath the stars and feel
the ocean waves, come and please me
ocean waves, come and go

We met on the evening of the Billy Idol look-alike contest
you looked so very pretty and hey, you looked exactly like him
We met on the evening of the Billy Idol look-alike contest
you looked so very pretty and hey, you looked exactly like him

It takes you to the promised land
but hell is where we'll meet again
It takes you to the promised land
but hell is where we'll meet again
