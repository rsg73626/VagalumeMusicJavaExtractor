CARLA

This is the one thing 
I can believe in
under the clouds 
sunbeams flame

Fining a moment 
when you're at your weakest
daughters & sons
gather and wait
gather and wait

Shogun
shogun
come see the shogunate
Shogun
shogun
come see the shogunate

Pillows and blankets
when you are sleeping
a soundless death
while the red halo shines

And i wander if I'll see you in the dark
and I can't stop the bleeding from my eyes
And i wander if I'll see you in the dark
and I can't stop the bleeding from my eyes

Shogun
shogun
come see the shogunate
Shogun
shogun
come see the shogunate

And I'll wait for the change of day
and i'll love to see it through the drapes

And my conscience, it is hard to break
and i'll go on till your functions fade

I wander if I, wander if I...
