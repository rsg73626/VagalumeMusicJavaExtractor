ANTI-VALENTINE

I'm through with love
think I've had it with you baby
it must be a bit cruel
to trade peaches for lies

I found a trace of a light
that used to be a flame
and you said many times
I'm and island in your stream
I found a trace of a light
that used to be a flame
oh you are...

My anti-valentine
My anti-valentine
My anti-valentine
My anti-valentine

I found a trace of a light
that used to be a flame
oh you are...

You want a sweet sound
while I won't do you baby
it must be a bit cruel
to trade peaches for lies

My anti-valentine
My anti-valentine
My anti-valentine
My anti-valentine

Name me a song
that I do not know
May was a whore
June a stone
June a stone

Name me a song
that I do not know
May was a whore
June a stone
June a stone
