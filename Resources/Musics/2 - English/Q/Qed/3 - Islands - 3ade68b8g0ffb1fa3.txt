ISLANDS

male)
If i walk away like i dont care
Will you magically appear
Oh to wipe away my tears

O the feeling in the darkness
O i could swear
You feel, so near
Just touch me if you're really there

(female)
Let me tell you how i feel,
I never felt a love so real,
Like an island from a cloud,
You'd picked me some how,
I was yours and you were mine,
In another place and time
Like two islands in the sea,
Seperated endlessly

(male)
Now say you love me like you do,
And all the things i wanna hear,
O all the things you whisper in my ear,
If all the things i lie behind you,
Show me how to work understandyou're here, right now,
And i cant even touch your hand

(female)
Let me tell you how i feel,
I never felt a love so real,
Like an island from a cloud,
You'd picked me some how,
I was yours and you were mine,
In another place and time
Like two islands in the sea,
Seperated endlessly
Is there a chance for love,like i've been dreaming of,
Dreaming about why you and me are gone,
So im holding onnnnn.....

Let me tell you how i feel,
I never felt a love so real,
Like an island from a cloud,
You'd picked me some how,
I was yours and you were mine,
In another place and time
Like two islands in the sea,
Seperated endlessly

Seperated endlessly
