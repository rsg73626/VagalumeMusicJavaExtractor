IF I DIDN'T HAVE YOU

Cornwall-
I'd be rocking with the dinos
Swinging with the rhinos
I'd de-dragonize this cave in a minute
Cornwall, they would sing
'Cause I would be the dragon king
I would love this world without you in it!
If I didn't have you! 

Devon-
If you didn't have me? 

Cornwall-
If I didn't have you! 

Devon-
Well, how about if I didn't have you, huh? 

Both-
Oh, what I could be if there was only me!
Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you! 

Kayley-
Stop bickering and get your act together. 

Devon-
Act? Did someone say act? I can act!
If only I had seperate parts
My career would be the arts
I'd be the star of Camelot
You'd be the half that the whole world forgot!
If I didn't have you! 

Cornwall-
I should be so lucky! 

Devon-
If I didn't have you! 

Cornwall-
Oh, wait! You'd be dead! 

Both-
Oh, what I could be if there was only me!
Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you!
Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you! 

Devon-
Trapped! Aah! Trapped! 

Cornwall-
Stuck here with you for 500 years! 

Devon-
Oh dear, it's learned to count. 

Cornwall-
If you'd got me a good lawyer I would have split 400 years ago. 

Devon-
Now, listen here, pal! I didn't come here to be insulted! 

Cornwall-
Oh? Where do you usually go? 

Devon-
I'd be a fire-breathing lizard! 

Cornwall-
I'd be one high-flying wizard! 

Devon-
You'd be nothing without me! You'd be extinct! You'd cease to be! 

Cornwall-
I'm so tired of your nagging! 

Devon-
And I'm so tired of your bragging! 

Cornwall-
Without me you'd have no brain. . . 

Both w/ Background Voices
. . . with which to think!

Both-
Life could be so sweet if these were both my feet!
What I'd do if I didn't have you! 

Devon-
I got you, babe! 

Both-
Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you! 

Well, if I didn't,
oh, if I didn't,
have you! 

Cornwall-
Thank you very much! 

Devon-
Thank you very much! 

Cornwall-
Thank you! 

Devon-
Devon has left the building! 

Cornwall-
You've never sung before have you?
