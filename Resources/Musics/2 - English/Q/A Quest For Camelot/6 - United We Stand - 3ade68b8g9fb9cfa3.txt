UNITED WE STAND

(choruse)
United we stand
Now and forever
In truth, divided we fall

Hand upon hand
Brother to brother
No one shall be greater than all

United we stand
Now and forever
In truth, divided we fall

Hand upon hand
Brother to brother
No one shall be greater than all

(King Arthur)
It's been ten years we celebrate
All that made our kingdom great
Liberty and Justice for all

Each of us will now divide
In equal shares our countryside
Promising equality for all who reside!

(chorus)
United we stand
Now and forever
In truth, divided we fall

Hand upon hand
Brother to brother
No one shall be greater than all

Liberty!
Justice!
Trust!

.Shall be greater than all

Freedom!
Peace!
Honour!

.No one greater than all

Goodness!
Strength!
Valour!

Shall be greater than . . .
