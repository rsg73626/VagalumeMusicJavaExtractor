LOOKING THROUGH YOUR EYES

G:Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see
Through your eyes

K:I see the heavens
Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see
Through your eyes

B:That's what I see
Through your eyes

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

I see your night I wish could last forever
I see your world we're meant to see together
And it is so much more than I remember

G:more than I remember!
K:More than I have known

B:Here in the night I see the sun
Here in the dark our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes
Looking through your eyes
