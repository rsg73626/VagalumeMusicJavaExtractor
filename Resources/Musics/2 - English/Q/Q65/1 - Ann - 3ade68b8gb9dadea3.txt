ANN

Ann, i will love you
When i know that i can
Ann, i will love you
When you know what i am
You think that you love me
But you don't know me yet
Perhaps i'm not what i'll be
You think that you love me
But i don't think it's that
You have to learn to live with me
Ann, i will try it
But i think that i can't
Ann, i will try it
But you won't understand
You think that you love me
But you don't know me yet
Perhaps i'm not what i'll be
You think that you love me
But i don't think it's that
You have to learn to live with me
