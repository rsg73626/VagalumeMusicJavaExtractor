THE BEAUTY OF ISLAM

Look at the beauty of Islam 
Spreading around the world 
See the preetiness of Islam 
Like llowers blooming everewhere 
Blooming and spreading grecefully 
On the highlands and on the valleys 
Take a look at the cause of the beaty 
They are servants working for their god 

And the beauty has been showered 
With the sweats of the companions 
And the preetiness has been enriched 
With the coming of the reformers
