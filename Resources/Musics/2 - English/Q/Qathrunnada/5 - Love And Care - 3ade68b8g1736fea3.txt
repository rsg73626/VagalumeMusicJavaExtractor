LOVE AND CARE

Every one in need of love 
Love and care 
It’s a love and happiness we’re looking for 
Every one of us needs to be defended 
In need of protection 
With dignity and honour 
Basic human rights shouldn’t be violated 
Offenders must be brought up 
In the face of justice 
To live with tolerance 
Should be there within your heart 
It leads to the rule of life in society 
To reason and be together 
For a life of happiness 
Blessings and peace within the society 

Tell me where 
O tell me where 
Love and care we’re searching for 
The need of man’s instinct 
Has been withered away 
Hopes that we hold on 
Have been totally destroyed 
Causing death and destrution 
Poverty and deprivation 
Are neglected so beware the rulers and the rich 
Never seem to love and care 

Tell me where 
O tell me where 
Love and care we’re searchingfor 
Oh god you are the one 
We lie all our hopes 
Only you the protector 
Only you the defender 
You are the one we’re looking for 
The true life sulution
