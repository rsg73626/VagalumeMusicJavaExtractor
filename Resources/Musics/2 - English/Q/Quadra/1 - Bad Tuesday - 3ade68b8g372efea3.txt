BAD TUESDAY

The pain is gone, nothing but lies
There is no magic in your eyes
I can go on he has the way
My fragile heart you can´t defend

The pain is gone, nothing but lies
So now i´m back on sunny grey
There is no magic in your eyes
So now i´m back on sunny grey
I can go on he has the way
So now i´m back on sunny grey
My fragile heart you can´t defend
So now i´m back on sunny grey
