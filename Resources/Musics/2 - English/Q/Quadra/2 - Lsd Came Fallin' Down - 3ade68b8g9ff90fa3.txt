LSD CAME FALLIN' DOWN

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go cos they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cos you're dead and free
You've got a new horizon It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no..

Windmill, Windmill for the land.
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Linin' em up like ass cracks,
Ladies, homies, at the track
it's my choc-o-late attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
watch me as I gravitate
hahahahahahaa.
Yo, we gonna go ghost town,
this motown,
with yo sound
you're in the blink
you gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound
you kill the INC.
so don't stop, get it, get it
until you're cheddar header.
Yo, watch the way I navigate
hahahahahaaa...

8x Sha-Shake it Shake it
9x Feel good.

Windmill, Windmill for the land.
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Dont shock, shit it, get it
bleep how you captains in it
steady, watch me navigate
hahahahahaaa..

Dont shock, shit it, get it
