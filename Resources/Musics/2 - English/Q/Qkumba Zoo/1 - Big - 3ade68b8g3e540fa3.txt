BIG

You're big! And strong!

You are big
And you shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream that will be spun

Don't listen to the hype about the UFOs
There's too many things nobody knows
They do their job and you do yours
Nobody does it better, we're the children of the stars
Hit it big with your heart
And big with your soul
Deep inside you're ready for the light
So move your body, dance your beat
Shake a dream alive, shake it

You are big
And you shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream that will be spun
Take some time to know yourself
You shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream

No need to apologize
There's no need to compromise
Sing your dream and sing it loud
It's real, it's yours, you should be proud

You are big
And you shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream that will be spun
Take some time to know yourself
You shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream

You're big! And strong!

You are big
And you shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream that will be spun
Take some time to know yourself
You shine like the sun
Feel it in your heart
The dream

You're big! And strong!
