FLESH AND BLOOD

Here I'm lying far from home
Cold without you by my side
Are you just a taunting dream
Torturing my lonely nights?
Lonely till my blood runs cold
My heart could break like falling ice
How can I make this place a home
Without the touch that I desire?

Come back to me, cling close to me
Let me feel your sheer solidity
Hold on to me, breathe in through me
Let me touch you in the mystery

Memory burns ghostly cold
Haunting me with melodies
How can I hold you without touch?
I'm clutching mist and fantasy

Come back to me, cling close to me
Let me feel your sheer solidity
Hold on to me, breathe in through me
Let me touch you in the mystery

Dream...

Locked inside this body
Your flesh is in my blood
Lost inside this body
Your breath is in my blood

Come back to me...

Come back to me, cling close to me
Let me feel your sheer solidity
Hold on to me, breathe in through me
Let me touch you in the mystery
