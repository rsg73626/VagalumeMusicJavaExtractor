RAIN

Rain walking
Lost in the rainy season
Water drips from the vines
I seek the places
The Earth has tried to hide
Ancient voices sing to me

Ne-yaha-y eheya-honehe-honehe-ho-ha (ti-yu! ti-ya!)

Ancient voices sing to me

Ne-yaha-y eheya-honehe-honehe-ho-ha ati-yanah

Can you see the light
In the desert
It's dancing like a rainbow
Voices chant 
With the sound of thunder 
And rain (bayaqhu ma, bayaqhu ma!)
(basaqhu ma, basaqhu ma!)
