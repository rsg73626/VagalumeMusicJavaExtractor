HAPPY EARTHDAY

In your body
Lies the secret
That will set you free
Don't be scared to
Touch your feelings,
Dance the energy

Happy Earthday
Happy Earthday
You can start a new life today
Happy Earthday
Happy Earthday
Listen and your heart will say

Oo-haye-vayena
Mahu-hayevaye na

Sink yourself into
The treasures
Flowing underground
Floating in a magic river
Rainbow round surround

Happy Earthday
Happy Earthday
You could start a real life today
Happy Earthday
Happy Earthday
Listen to your body say

Manerahu-entenayo,
Manerahu-entenayhe

Trust in the beat
Where it leads
You can choose to follow
Move to a dance
Of the heart
For a new tomorrow
