MERMAIDS

The sea looks kinda rough today, water cold and gray
Somewhere beneath all the fears and the old routines
Under that fact that you float in a treasure gleams

Live like a dolphin down beneath the waves
Hear mermaids sing
There is a treasure that shines for you
Beneath the ocean waves

Mermaids know what the sea can show to you
Right now it seems like you've shipwrecked your brightest dreams
Oh but they're still alive they will thrive as you rise up from the deep

What they told you, isn't all true, I'm not drowning, don't need a rescue
If you want to see, come and swim with me
You will remember how to breathe
