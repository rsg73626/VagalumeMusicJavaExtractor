TOUCHED AND LEFT FOR DEAD

A dying entity has left us
From out of the dark
It slips away, far off into the night
I can see its shadow somehow changing
No longer of flesh or of spirit
It is left friendless and unburied
Secluded, dying and rotting
Yet fully aware of its emptiness
Fully aware of its nothingness

The Star-abodes,now uniting
It slips away, far off into the night
Its soul is somehow dying
No longer of importance, no longer of the essence

Still punished
Still repenting

Still left friendless and unburied
Secluded, dying and rotting
Yet fully aware of its emptiness
Fully aware of its nothingness

This is the way to hell
