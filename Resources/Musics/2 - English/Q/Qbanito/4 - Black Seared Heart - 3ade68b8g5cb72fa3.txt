BLACK SEARED HEART

When I look upon these burialgrounds my heart sighs
Deep is the dark, so it my heart

My black seared heart is the way
from the cold clouds above rains
Dust of death
In my mouth, in my breath

The cold struck urge for pain
Increases the lust to gain
Reign of knowledge
My apcalyptic vision at its very peak

My black seared heart can wait no longer
The force deep desertion has grown stronger
