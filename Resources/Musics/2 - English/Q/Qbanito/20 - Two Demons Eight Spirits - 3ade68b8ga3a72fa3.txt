TWO DEMONS EIGHT SPIRITS

"Come forth demons Breathe through the walls that entomb you"

The sword of my armour
My wind of of something darker
The hole of my grave dug deeper
The hymms of my funeral get louder
The evil tyrant I was I am
Laughter for lust I greed
The spells of my spirit
This world I now leave

My sword might be rusty
My mind may be old
But no one can change my faith
It has been foretold

[chorus]
I am a harbour for restless demonsouls
I have left nothing
Two demong eight Spirits

Later eight spirits will be left to me
Then I shall be for all eternity
