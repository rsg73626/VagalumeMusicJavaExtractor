EATER OF THE DEAD

See the bodies
Drenched in pools of blood
All of them dead
Some by their own hand
Seeking refuge in suicide
As terror spreads throughout the land

No sleep
No peace
The carnage never cease

Darkness unfolds upon the earth
Each day another loss

The pain grows stronger every day
Until death comes to take them away
The ground is painted red by blood
In their thousands they lie dead
Abruptly awakened from the serenity of dreams
To reality where terror reigns supreme

Darkness unfolds upon the earth
Each day another loss
Hunted each and everyone
All the bodies left to rot in the sun
