BLEEDING THE BLUE FLAME

Immaculate and perfect
The one who stands alone
Bleeding the blue flame
A man-being veiled into another form
Bleeding the blue flame
Victimized, nothing but a human cast
You are bleeding the blue flame

What has become of this man ?
He cannot even see his own pain
He is bleeding the blue flame

This man will be made to suffer
This one will be the first
Bleed!

Yet man and devil are not too far apart
He who seeks evil within his own heart

This man will be made to suffer
Blessed with every curse
Of darkness
