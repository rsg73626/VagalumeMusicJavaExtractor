AD ARMA AD ARMA

In total control
Total supremacy
Terror spreads with increasing speed
Towards the west from the east

Soldiers scream out in fascination
Caused by horror beyond their imagination
Killing humanity in one glorious moment of passion
Sought pleasure in that one moment of total satisfaction
Call out for global suicide
Mankind's only saviour from life

Humanity wondering what went wrong
Dying whilst the war-machine rolls on

Euthanasia, killing out of sympathy
Saving humanity from it's overwhelming stupidity
Thousands die by second
Millions die by the minute
Nations die by the hour
All hail the rise of nuclear power

Humanity wondering what went wrong
Dying whilst the war-machine rolls on
Humanity wondering what went wrong
Humanity fellating the barrel of a gun
Thousands die by second
Millions die by the minute
Nations die by the hour
All hail the rise of nuclear power
