DEVILS WORK

Made of a thousand lies
Spreading your christian filth
Praying to a god that has died
In hell you live your life

Engulfed by darkness
The devils work is done
Things are the same as always
The christian pig never won

End the pain
End this life
End the pain
End this life

Made of a thousand lies
You believe in paradise

Engulfed by darkness
The devil's work is done
Things are the same as always
The christian pig never won

End the pain
God will never live again

End the pain
End this life
End the pain
End this life
