THE WORD BECAME FLESH

Night grows near,the everlasting night
That draws this world to an end
No longer a part of the darkly clouds
He stands alone in eternal splendour

[Chorus]

The word became flesh and set tent amongst the living
Whilst I spoke to the dead but dreaming
Dwellers of the deep succumb to their law
Riders of fire, bringers of awe

Many a spell you have granted
Many a soul you have shattered
Universal your magic spread far and wide

In pain I prise them
Your dream of Darkness
Where no keys are left within the grasp of light

Tonight we gather round
Each a knight, we secrifice
With the certainly of death we are still alive

[Chorus]
