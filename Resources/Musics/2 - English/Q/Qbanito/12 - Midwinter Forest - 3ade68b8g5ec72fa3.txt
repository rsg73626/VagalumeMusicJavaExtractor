MIDWINTER FOREST

Frozen shadows of trees in the snow
Like the claws of a thousand wolves
It lies there like a sleeping ghost
Waiting to be awakened by a spell

The ravens in the sky
The silent screams in their clear black eyes
As they see the blood in the snow
Thousands of men in this battle did fall

Like dragons they fought, to the last man had died
There was never a thought of surrender
Buried in the snow they are forever laid to rest
in this haunting midwinter forest
