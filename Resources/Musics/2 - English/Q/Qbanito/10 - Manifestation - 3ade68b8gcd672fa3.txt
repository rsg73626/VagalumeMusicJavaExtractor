MANIFESTATION

I will find my way
Through this void called life some day
I cast my spell to set them free
I serve the demons,they serve me

By ways of Belial
On paths of ancient times
I call out in vengeance
I know your name

Shaitan
Night has come
I feel the forces shift and turn
I call your name
Shaitan

By ways of Baphomet
On paths of ancient times
I call out in anger
I know your name

Satan
