DEADLIGHTS

From the east
A thundering roar is heard
Countless victims
Struck by fear
As the time draws near,
Anticipation builds
The aggressor attacks
And leaves no man alive

The beast rises from out of the pit
To tell the news of man's destruction
To wage war against every nation
The time has come to kill

Protector and destroyer of worlds
In your rage lies the death of the earth

The flames reach towards the sky
And the earth dies
