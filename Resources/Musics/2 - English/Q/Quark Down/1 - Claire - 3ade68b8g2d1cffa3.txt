CLAIRE

She always drives me crazy
I dont know what I do
I see her in a several places
Until in reflections of the moon

And she abuses of her curves
They lead me for a lost way
And she abuses of her lips
They bring me forgotten days

She is a storm or a queen
I guess No man can say
She's really a great mystery
Many drinks to forget her

She has blue eyes as the sea
And an attractive smell? by the way
She walks spreading her charm to
I try to find her so far away.

One more time try again
Because someday the things change
Try to overcome now?..every day

And she abuses of her curves
They lead me for a lost way
And she abuses of her lips
They bring me forgotten days

She has blue eyes as the sea
And an attractive smell? by the way
She walks spreading her charm to
I try to find her so far away.

One more time try again
Because someday the things change
Try to overcome now?..every day
