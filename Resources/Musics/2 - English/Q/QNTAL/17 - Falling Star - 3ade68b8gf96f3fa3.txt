FALLING STAR

Go, and catch a falling star,
Get with child a mandrake root,
Tell me, where all past years are,
Or who cleft the Devil’s foot.

Falling star, shine with the pale moonlight
Elfin come, elfin fairy dance by night.

Go, and catch a falling star,
Get with child a mandrake root,
Tell me, where all past years are,
Or who cleft the Devil’s foot.

Falling star, shine with the pale moonlight
Elfin come, elfin fairy dance by night.

If thou be’est born to strange sights,
Things invisible to see,
Ride ten thousand days and nights,
Till age snow white hairs on thee.

Falling star, shine with the pale moonlight
Elfin come, elfin fairy dance by night.
