BLAC

Blac is the colour that is good,
so say I and many mo;
blac is my hat, blac is my hood
blac is all that longeth therto.

Summe men sayen that I am blac -
it is a colour for my prow;
ther I love, ther is no lac,
I may not be so white as thou.
blac wol do as good a nede
as the white at bord and bedde;
and therto also trew in dede,
and therto I ley my lif to wedde.

Wind and water may steyne the white,
iwis; the blac it may not so.
ther is the blac is all my delite;
I am iholde be skile therto.
pepper withoute it is well blac,
iwis; withinne it is not so.
lat go the colour an tak the smac,
this I sey by me and mo.
