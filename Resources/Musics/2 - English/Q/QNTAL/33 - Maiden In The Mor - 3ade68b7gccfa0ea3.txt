MAIDEN IN THE MOR

,,Im Moor liegt eine Frau seit sieben Tagen,
was war ihre Speise, was war ihr GetrÃ¤nk?
Die Blumen, das Quellwasser
Wo war ihre Wohnung?
Bei den Lilien und den Rosen"

Maiden in the mor lay,

sevenight fulle, sevenight fulle.
maiden in the mor lay,
in the mor lay,
sevenightes fulle and a day.

the chelde water of the welle spring.

the red rose and the-
the red rose and the lilie flour.
