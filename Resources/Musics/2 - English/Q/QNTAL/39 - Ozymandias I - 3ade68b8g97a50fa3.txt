OZYMANDIAS I

I met a traveller from an antique land, who said:
"two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert...
and on the pedestal these words appear:
'my name is Ozymandias, king of kings;
look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
nothing beside remains.
the lone and level sands stretch far away."
