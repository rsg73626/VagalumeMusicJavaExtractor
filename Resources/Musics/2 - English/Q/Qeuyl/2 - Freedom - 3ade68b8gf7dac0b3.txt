FREEDOM

Freedom
Yes ladies and gentlemen allow me
To introduce myself I go by the name of mic massive
And right now I need you to assit me
In bringing out this new pop sensation

Qeuyl make some noice yeah ahh lets go

Take a good look
What do you see
When you starring down
And look back at me
Do you see a strong man
Who had a dream
Do you see the parts that scars and bleeds
Did you know I had to wrestle
And speak through a vessel called
Boom box and tv screens
And no matter how close I come
I'm always to far from everyone

But we fly farther
And we go harder
To be one step ahead of the game
And we push stronger
And we go longer
So the world can remember our name
And no matter what you think you know
We all want the same thing
And no matter what you think you know
We all want one thing

You wonna be free
You wonna be ree
Put your hands up to the sky
And pretend that we can fly
You wonna be free

I took paths
I've never known
And shook hands
With fake drones
I've stared
Into the face of danger
And laughed because he was a stranger
I stood on the edge and looked straight down
The faces I saw reminds me now
Of the crowd
And the sounds
And the beats that hold me down

But we fly farther
And we go harder
To be one step ahead of the game
And we push stronger
And we go longer
So the world can remember our name
And no matter what you think you know
We all want the same thing
And no matter what you think you know
We all want one thing

You wonna be free
You wonna be ree
Put your hands up to the sky
And pretend that we can fly
You wonna be free

Bridge
No matter where you been
No matter where you go
No matter who you are
No matter how far you wonna be
No matter where you go
No matter who you are
No matter how far
(if you can crawl than you can try if you can run
Than you can fly)
No matter where you been
No matter where you go
No matter who you are
No matter how far you wonna be
No matter where you go
No matter who you are
No matter how far you wonna be

You wonna be free
You wonna be ree
Put your hands up to the sky
And pretend that we can fly
You wonna be free

Thank you thank you
