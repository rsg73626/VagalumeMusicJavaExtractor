DANGEROUS

I'm not the best you'll ever love

But I'm the best you'll ever need
I'm the worst at being comfortable
But I'm the best at living free

This ain't a fairytale
So far from a love song
I think I should warn you
Your friends an I won't get along
I know you're tired of the lies
You're tired of the pain
I got bad news
Its part of the game
I'm not like other guys
We are not the same
Cause I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn

This is my conviction
Not my satisfaction
You should run away
Cause you'll become addicted
Like fatal attraction
You should run away

Cause baby I'm dangerous
Dangerous dangerous dangerous
Baby I'm dangerous
Dangerous dangerous dangerous
You should run away

I know you heard it all before
Been through the robes
And through the fire
You say you want to know me
Well the're some things that I require
I like girls who like to play
Let the camera be your bestfriend
The innocent approach is lame
I like them girls who like them girls
and do it up like its the last dance

This is my conviction
Not my satisfaction
You should run away
Cause you'll become addicted
Like fatal attraction
You should run away

Cause baby I'm dangerous
Dangerous dangerous dangerous
Baby I'm dangerous
Dangerous dangerous dangerous
You should run away
