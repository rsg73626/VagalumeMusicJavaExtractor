THROUGH THE STORM

Questions
Contemplate my mind
I've been
Stuck on borrowed time
You were
The one to catch my eye
From the first time (the first time the first time)

Now it feels like
I'm floating on top of the world
Can't believe
You saw me
When I was lost
And now that we're here
I have no fear
I'll be there
Whenever you call
Count on it

And Through the storm and through the rain
Through the hurt and through the pain
I'll be here
Through it all
And I'll catch you if you fall
So through the storm and through the rain
[Verse 2]
Baby I know
How hard life has been
But even
Chairs need legs to stand
I see
All the things you try
Like a dove that can't fly
But I'm here now
To change your visions of life
I will guide you
To make all your wrongs right
(Trust in me) Trust me I
Been through it all
The tough part is to fall

And Through the storm and through the rain
Through the hurt and through the pain
I'll be here
Through it all
And I'll catch you if you fall
So through the storm and through the rain
[Ending Hook}
I'll be here
Through it all
And I'll catch you when you fall
So through the storm
Through the rain
Through the storm
Through the rain
Through the storm
Through the rain
Through the storm
Through the rain
Through the storm
Through the rain
Through the storm
Through the rain
Through the storm
