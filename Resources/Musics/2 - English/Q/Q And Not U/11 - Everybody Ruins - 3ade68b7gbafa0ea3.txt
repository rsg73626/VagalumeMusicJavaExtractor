EVERYBODY RUINS

The clientele:
Your kin and friends taking their bodies in
and trading them for ends.
We took our bodies and we put them up
to fend against their bodies and the cycle never ends.
Taste it! Taste it!
What are we now?
Two eyes and seven seams all working
to show how much we need to feel permission
to go forget our bodies and just taste it, taste it?
They're busy pissing family colors out.
Going out dinner with our mothers.
Coming back and tucking in our daughters.
But they don't know what they're doing
because they don't know how to damage how we love.
