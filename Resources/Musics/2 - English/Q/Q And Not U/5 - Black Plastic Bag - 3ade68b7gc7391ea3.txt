BLACK PLASTIC BAG

Who's paying your mortgage?
Daddy's dying.
Throw yourself on the body.
Take out your sharp teeth.
Line your lungs with noise then just sew it up.
In and out is like this it's like a fist.
You want the questions you got your answers down.
You want the answers, you got the face fleshed out.
The air is full of harmonies but is anyone even sleeping right?
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower, don't worry.
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower tonight.
