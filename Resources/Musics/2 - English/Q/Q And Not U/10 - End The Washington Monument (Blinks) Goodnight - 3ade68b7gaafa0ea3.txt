END THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT (BLINKS) GOODNIGHT

inside the convex lens we all crash new jet planes tonight. 
and the sin is back in medicine. 
beltway goes around. 
monuments are thinking. 
beltway burns down. 
monuments are sinking. 
and it's on. 
everything's fine. 
we'll sleep on ice when this bed is on fire. 
we'll sleep all nice but instead of retire,
we'll kick those lights out. 
this party is on fire. 
we'll kick these lights out.
