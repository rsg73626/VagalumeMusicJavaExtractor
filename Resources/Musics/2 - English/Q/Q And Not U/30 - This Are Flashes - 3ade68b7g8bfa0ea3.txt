THIS ARE FLASHES

I sprout confused from atop my head.
These ears as teeth between my legs.
Who has the nerve to sing la la la?
Tie down all the moves.
Conceived released.
Didn't drop or break.
Focus in focus.
En garde.
Your line is lauded and depraved.
New sonic reduction's barely staid.
Who has the nerve to sing la la la?
This native song in sharp relief.
New watered down passion play can barely speak.
This native song in sharp relief.
This watered down passion play is staring to leak.
La la la.
This name is a language I don't understand.
