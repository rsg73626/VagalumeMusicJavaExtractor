RECREATION MYTH

Hands up give in to modernism.
The re-enactment's closing in.
But we're past that now.
Dip your head in the water.
Hands up and over.
Heads down in shame.
Give in, give in.
Is this the cup that's worth more than me.
Complicity.
Ask what happened to believers.
They will never believe again.
Counted the times that it wasn't true.
They'll never wash your feet again.
When I was born no one counted the fingers and toes.
