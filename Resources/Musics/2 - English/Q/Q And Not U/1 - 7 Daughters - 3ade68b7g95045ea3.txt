7 DAUGHTERS

a fume of smoke, a perfumed rain.
a strong bull pulls a strong till.
a fume of smoke, a fume.
i cannot digest what i ingest in jest. 
what doth i protest?
lungs in throat, rigged with wire and hay.
a jewel from rote, shines strongs as binds.
our jewel from rote, a jewel.
tied with wire hay, pressed in rock and clay. 
'til their not they.
cartoon of self, rich in yes and no, no, yes, and no, no.
a strong bull tills the strong soil.
amused of self, amused.
first born will be eve and second shed rebecca 
and third bred keturah.
fourth birthed is sarah, fifth fifth fifth will be judith, 
sixth sixth left us basemith, seventh seventh truthful ruth, 
and eighth, oh, it's my turn.
