L.A.X

i found some teeth in the street, whatever that means.
smell the flesh in the air. however i care.
plans and bodies.
new terror, loose graves.
change the code to discreet.
forever that means trace events of the day beyond mind's means.
trained in body.
non territory non days.
face the road to deceit together stain scenes.
erase back drop of concrete unsustained dreams.
holy/unholy.
win terror lose grace.
untrained eye on the street lost and eye on the street.
war drums drumming.
nude terror new days.
i'll take the blame and not the blood.
i'll learn the shame and not the faces.
turn our bodies into objects.
just meat to fill the plans.
life everlasting, or eternal relationships, or whatever that means and no answers.
get over, get over, get over.
count the numbers not the names.
weigh the corpse but not the faces.
turn our bodies into objects.
just the blood out in the rain.
numbers and the names.
all our blood and all our faces.
left the shit out in the rain.
turned abject hatred into love.
life everlasting, or eternal relationships, or whatever that means and infinite get over, get over, get over.
the war drums drum.
to find the teeth in the street, what does that mean?
untrained eyes on the street ever after.
war drums drumming.
