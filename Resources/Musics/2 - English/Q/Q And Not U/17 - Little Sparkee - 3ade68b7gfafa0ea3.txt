LITTLE SPARKEE

there's something in my pocket
and you want to set me free. 
keep me another way. 
you and me and i've seen it in front of me. 
lies. 
the truth. 
these tracks they're running me. 
keep a straight line. 
collide. 
let's let these sparks fly. 
or kept in line? 
you held your head so high. 
not this time. 
ole. 
i saw the sign. 
it's your design.
