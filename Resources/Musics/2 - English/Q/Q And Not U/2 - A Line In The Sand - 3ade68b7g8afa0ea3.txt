A LINE IN THE SAND

the first time. 
the second time. 
let's stop this clock from starting. 
wrong, the time's spelled wrong. 
why won't you ever start? 
why won't you? 
time ticking spell it right. 
understand. 
it's 1974, '73, '72. 
cape tight fit on from here out. 
"kiss and ride." 
"twist and shout."
