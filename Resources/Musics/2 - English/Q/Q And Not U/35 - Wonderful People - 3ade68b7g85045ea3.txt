WONDERFUL PEOPLE

dear wonder people, do you think we've met?
i wonder where, i wonder what was said.
oh wonder people, how do you set such wonderful examples for young wonder people?
their future's always brighter.
old wonder people, their burden's always lighter.
but wonder people are rarely seen without it.
no wonder people sit and wonder all day about it.
wonderful people, i wonder if they'll show me wonderful secrets and never leave me lonely.

wonderful people, your song plays on the breeze.
we're collecting in every street and every crazy heart is beating.
oh wonder people, your song lives in my trees.
we're collecting on every corner, passing out on every border.

oh wonder people, i'm thankful that you found me.
now wonder people are crowding all around me.
wonderful people, please know I'd never doubt you.
and when one shot rang out, that's when I got lost without you.

i lost myself in the streets.
people softly running running.
i woke adrift in the sea.
water softly running running.

go run, go run, run!
people running, running, running.
go run, go run, run!
water running, running, running.

now i belong to the sea.
water softly running running.
like shots whispered in the streets
and people softly running running.

oh wonder people, can we take to the races?
i wonder if i can make it at your paces.
oh wonder people, you're racing all around me.
just like an ocean, now the other ones can't surround me.

go run, go run, run!
people running, running, running.
go run, go run, run!
water running, running, running.
