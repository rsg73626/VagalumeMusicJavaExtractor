THE MORE I GET THE MORE I WANT

want to show you the new dance. 
but you'd be shocked by what was allowed. 
feel effects of progress. 
been the face in the crowd. 
killed for a song. 
long to forgive/forget. 
reset the blame. 
the interesting part's always caught outside the frame. 
turn the red camera on. 
so much to say. 
lines gave me away. 
all your lies are dyed in the wool. 
say them faster. 
hypnosis. 
unlock doors but keep them closed. 
severed ties taste of shit. 
unlock, you unlock. 
can't stop the train.
