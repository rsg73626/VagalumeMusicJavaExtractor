SO MANY ANIMAL CALLS

Everyday up at the hospital people go in and out animals in and out.
They live together in the hospital.
They share positions now.
That's how they're living now.
Everday up in the hospital people and animals all waiting around.
It's no safari now.
We all go in and out we all go in and out and in and out and in and out.
I spent my holidays at the hospital visiting animals and people I know,
adjusting pillows and still wondering,
"How do they make those sounds?"
Visitors must sign in/out and check off the time-in/out.
So please spend your holidays in the hospital,
visiting animals and people you know.
No camouflage in this workplace, now.
Scents make sense out loud.
