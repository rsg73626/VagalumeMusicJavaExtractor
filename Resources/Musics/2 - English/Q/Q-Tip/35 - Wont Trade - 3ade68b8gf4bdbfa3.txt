WONT TRADE

Now that I know what is boy 

For your epitaph niggers 
Laugh, tricks that he gassed your ass 
Siphon and not your cash 
Seeing the door in a flash 
While I stay enclosed 
Walkin' out my clothes she said, 

I won't trade him for nothing 

You're mother fucking right 
Walking this shit every night 
Fin this shit? Hold it tight 
rina filma on my sleeve?? 
Even when I have to leave 
Cooler than even in the breeze 
Do you believe 
I was waiting for nothin' 
The one division leader 
In the rebound new group of shorties 
Off the post, goin' coast to coast 
She on the hard ones, sub him out the game she sayin' 
"naw, he good, I mean" 

I won't trade him for nothing 

For no amount of dough 
Franchise this man 
Give him all the things you can 
Think long term plans 
he be bringin in the fans 
Front page magazine, listen to this lady scream 
I won't trade him for nothing 

Cause she know what's better her top and 
Now a beckon on the flu 
Like a runnin' with the nicest nigger 
kinda sorta ?? 
When he's singing just to slaughter no matter the quarter 

I won't trade him for nothing 

The club house king 
batting practice Slugger swing, 
game time same thing 
When I'm in about a minute 
Holdin' the bat, as good as fat 
She's out the park and comin back she's saying 

I won't trade him for nothing 

And for ray you say you get it good 
If you were the ball player at all 
And the famous fall inevitably will make a call 
Hangin' memorabilia from you walls 

This is why you can't trade me 
I won't trade him for nothing 
Now that I know what is boy 

You can bet your money on a sure thing 
Certain profit's what it brings 
Ceremonies of the ringer in the white house wing 
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring, do you wanna trade? 

I won't trade him for nothing 

'Cause in the air? there's a teammate you're lookin' for 
back-shoot and aughter ball?? 
Leaves it all on the floor 
Always lookin' to score 
Pep talks in the locker room 
This is why you sing this tune 

I won't trade him for nothing 

And then you reach Can't make me sit out 
I go 'til you get out 
Her ball no get out 
An all night get-down 
I train for the pressure 
and come out fresher 
Equipped for the game 
you know my name, it makes me better 
I cheer for the whole team 
Let's go for the whole thing 
The ballots that you're holding 
MVP voting 
And I represent the sentiment you're emoting 
And you say 

I won't trade him for nothing 


The physical ability with mental capability 
Legitimately faces me outside of your vicinity 
And I ain't really seein' me 
Vacating this community I'm staying in 

I won't trade him for nothing 

I'm glad that you feel this way, 
Here is where I like to play 
Need to hear it everyday 
They cheer for me, say "Olay!" 
Wait a minute, "Andale?" 
I don't know, well anyway..
