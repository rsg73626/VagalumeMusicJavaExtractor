JOHNNY IS DEAD

Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen 
And I think about my chance for me to intervene 
And its up to me to bring back the hopeful 
feeling in the music that you can quote 
not saying that I hate it 
'cause yeah, I kinda dig it 
But what good is an ear if a Q-Tip isn't in it 

So this year get in 
and inform your friend 
your boy from the hood 
is on that shit again 

he's upped the degrees 
and dropped the mercury 
to splash on the mass 
from low to upperclass 

and when the record spins 
it sometimes blows a wind 
a fickleness of fans 
they sometimes hate again 

they always bring up Tribe by me 
could not survive, I mean 
this is my mans, I mean 
this is my fams 

and here's somethin' new 
it's front row for you 
so don't misconstrue 
its tribal and true 

my dudes who hustle hard 
will stop your repetoire 
as long as you can see 
its you who's stayin' free 

'cause life is filled with 'cerns 
keep pills and little burns 
and shit, I'm fuckin' up I mean 
I'm trippin' out 

but still there is a void 
and people get annoyed 
let's focus on the feel 
before we get a deal 
c'mon 

(Chorus) 
Figuring life can't be a thing 
the wilderness is wild to me 

but you're not alone I see we're just the same 
figuring out where we should be 

Figuring life can't be a thing 
the wilderness is wild to me 
but you're not alone I see we're just the same 

(verse II) 
Moving while we can 
to put back on the street 
let's take care of ours 
and ensure we eat 

and opening in 
they critize the boys 
without enmity 
they lose all the noise 

they can't keep us down 
we're dominant and brown 
and those of other shades 
they join our parade 

but wait, there's rain ahead 
like Brit and Kevin Fed 
and magazine debris 
its shit you gotta see 

I'm no diff'rent to you 
I goes through it too 
I thumbs through the page 
I don't come of age 

I'm not a deity 
I'm far from perfect see 
I roll a tumbleweed 
this's just a humble seed 

that i present to you 
its just a mr. groove 
with words of harmony 
and soon a melody 

that speaks to where we are 
the door of hopes ajar 
and soon we walkin' in 
uplifted just to say 
c'mon 

Chorus 2x
