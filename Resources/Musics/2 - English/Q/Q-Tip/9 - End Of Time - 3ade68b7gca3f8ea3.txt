END OF TIME

Q-Tip
Just feelin' things out for real, ya know?
Just wanna do me for real, ya know?
No reason to make it complicated, 
You feelin' agitated, 
You love it or you hate it, fuck it
Desperation, jumpin' off of street corners here
Hustlahz lookin for buzz like "pop one in here"
Local state officials
Yeah they out of touch
Getting money for some, aiyo, ain't nothin' much
But yo, let them tell it, 
We smoke it and we sell it
You don't understand, so don't tell it
You sneakin' souls just for phat diamond golds
Cuz our lady friends have likings 
For designer clothes
People in my hood think
If I'm lookin raggedy, 
Then the cat is just a weak link
In the very fake chain of oppression
If television taught me any lesson, it's
"Image is Nothing", 
But yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirst
What's first? Your rings or your purse?

Jonathan Davis (KoRn)-
(Oh boy, oh boy! 
Make your wagers back there! 
Step lively, women and children first! 
The world is coming to an end! 
Come on now, we're looking at the end! 
We have to leave them, 
We have to leave all our paraphanelias behind 
{brought back, brought back.[repeated]} 
LET'S GOOOOO!)

It's kinda scary you see
How fucked up things can be
Each time you take a bath
How it could have been your last
There's so much shit around us
Things we can't even see
Is this the end of our line?
That's where I wanna be, 
That's where I wanna be
That's where I want to be, 
That's where I want to be
