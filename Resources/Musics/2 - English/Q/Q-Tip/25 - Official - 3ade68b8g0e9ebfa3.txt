Oh yeah 
Well the bell has rung 
Cause the time is here 
Oh Yeah 
We gotta switch it around 
And put the thing in gear 
Oh yeah 
Not much is for sho 
But this here is true 
Oh yeah 
I gotta do it for me 
But then I'll do it for you 

Major attraction 
Trouble distraction 
Scramble up my name and it still come action 
Musics our number 
Dial to sue slumber 
Open up ya ears to the low tint of thunder 
Created Queens native 
Mixes automated 
Want some fresh shit then we'll corralate it 
Busta is furocios 
I'm flawed and percosious 
Carryin' fools out 
Cause ma willy bodocious 
Peoples dont blame me 
Shortys cant game me 
Country cherokee 
But the city here made me 
rock like coral 
distinctive bout my hormals 
Gotta lil grime 
And gotta lotta lorals 
The rhthym stay bangin 
My one two thangin 
Is eximplified by the cop left hangin 
Percussions our weapons 
Drums are Smith and Wessn's 
lyrics pop it off 
Leaving deep impressions 

Oh yeah 
Well the bell has rung 
Cause the time is here 
Oh Yeah 
We gotta switch it around 
And put the thing in gear 
Oh yeah 
Not much is for sho 
But this here is true 

Oh yeah 
I gotta do it for me 
and then do it for you 

I feel what the beat does 
People fuck wit me cause 
When the song end 
I become what the beat was 
Same thing is otha 
No need for cookie cutta 
The bar gets raised 
Not ya average old gutta 
For that I hit a chin up 
B, ya time been up 
Woulda came sooner 
But I overslept my get up 
Now lets get in the middle 
Girl I'll solve ya riddle 
Cause we can be strong 
And protect against the brittle 
Ya groupies need to see me 
Go and get the cd 
I aerosol you all top to bottom like graffiti 
? 
Dudes say I'm plottin 
When you here the music 
Thus begin the mardi gra'n 
Bribes aint the issue 
Thats how I'm gone get you 
Dont need a bill board 
hit for me to hit you 
The clear for ya mic its 
Who always come the tightest 
Queens everywhere 
Demonstratin who the fyest 

Oh yeah 
Well the bell has rung 
Cause the time is here 
Mm Mm 
We gotta change it around 
And put our things in gear 
Oh yeah 
Not much is for sho 
But this thang is true 
Oh yeah 
I gotta do it for me 
And then do it for you
