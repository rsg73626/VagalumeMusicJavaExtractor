YOU

wait 
its you 
and at the end of it all its you 
and at the end 
its you 
at the end of it all its you 
its you 
its you 
at the end of it all its you 
its you 
its you 
at the end of it all 

lookin for how i see her 
when i finally realized couldn't believe it 
i couldn't, even swallow 
had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow 
i had a notion that things were fishy 
but everything was fine so i'd be pissy 
but when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in 
thats when the snoopin and shit it would begin 
where you at? 
where you going? 
thats what i get when i pick up the phone 
not a hello or i miss you 
or the renaissnace how does it do? 
suspicious ones go few 
can stress out your brain 
in weighs on your mane 
and helps you peep game i thought it was me 
but then i could it see 

it was you 
its you 
at the end of it all it was you 
and at the end 
it was you 
at the end of it all it was you 
and at the end 
its you 
its you 
at the end of it all its you 
its you 
its you 
at the end of it all 

i couldn't take it 
but the spell of love 
i couldn't shake it 
even though i would discover 
that there was somebody else 
it was your lover 
you gave me up 
and managed to turn the tables 
and all your honest words they turn to fables 
the things that you would accuse me of 
it seem were the things you were doin love 
get it? these things you projected 
and i don't want to be affected 
but when you get in love 
its never easy love 
to make decisions of 
you've defected 
you were doin so much to try to pin me 
goin through all my stuff but it was empty 
answers, that im seekin 
well it seem im gettin close 
that im reachin 
and i was thinkin i had no reason 
callin you a culprit it was treason 
and the twinkle in your eye 
it was kinda not for love 
and tell me why? 
we'll make a mends if you admit it 
we can ascend if your commited 
your heart, is it in it? 
if it goes for many days 
sweet love can decay from you 

its you 
at the end of it all it was you 
and at the end 
it was you 
at the end of it all it was you 
and the end 
its you 
its you 
at the end of it all its you 
its you 
its you 
at the end of it all
