BELIEVE (FEAT. D'ANGELO)

I believe that's love 

that's love.... 

I believe that's love 

I believe that's love 

that's love.... 

I believe that's love 

I believe love, love 



uh of the things we believe 
there's a whole lot of work we should roll up our sleeves 
and we got a hold firm when fate's full like a sieve 
why doubt your plans cause when its all worth believing 
we can make it work do believe that 
we've mistrust in the dust and believe fact 
we can achieve tact 
by tuning out negative feedback 
naysayers can hate we concentrate to bring belief back 
into ourselves into the world into the rap game 
emcees are miserable that means their music's leaving mikes maimed
man look we holding down for the truth 
if we alone in the loop we gone hold for the proof 
man put it in believing 
believe in believing 
seeing ain't believing its the feeling that we needing 
believe in each other put the question to the system 
they promising returns then question what you getting 
we should believe in the reasons we existing 
time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it 
belief can confirm make it is what it isn't 
sometimes i wish i had belief when i didn't 

I believe that's love 

I believe that's love 

that's love 

in the land of make belief time to make unbelief believable 
take a belief to the realm of the real 
believe in this shit that's force fed through the medium 
believe it is real when it's really a raw deal 
never disbelieve when you see human miracle 
like ghetto children shining bright in babylon 
believe in that don't believe in stats to the contrary 
gotta be weary of them theories carry on 
people find belief when they don't find identity 
believe in your friends don't believe in your enemies 
mountains of doubts and disbeliefs right in front of you 
troops on the other side what u gone do 

OOOH OOOH I BELIEVE- 

OOOH THAT'S LOVE THAT'S LOVE 

OOOH OOOH I BELIEVE- 

OOOH THAT'S LOVE THAT'S LOVE 

I BELIEVE LOVE, LOVE 

I BELIEIVE LOVE, LOVE
