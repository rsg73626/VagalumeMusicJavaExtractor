LIFE IS BETTER (FEAT. NORAH JONES)

[Norah Jones] 
Life's filled with graaaay.... 
But now, it comes clean.. 
Leaves fall, awaaaaaay... 
Hip-hop is playing again 
And it's bangin, toooo.... 
Know it's bangin, for you... 
Don't stop this feeling I feel... 
I just wanna lay around all day 
and feel the breeze upon my knees 
I'm so INTO your rich history.. 
Tell me a story to taaaake me away.. 
Come and take meeeeee, ooooooh... 
Come and take meeeeee with yooooou.. 

[Chorus 4X: Norah Jones] 
Life is, better 
Now that, now that I found you 
Life is, better 
Now that, now that I found you
