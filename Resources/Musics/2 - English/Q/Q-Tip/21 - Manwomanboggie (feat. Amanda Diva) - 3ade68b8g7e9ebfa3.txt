MANWOMANBOGGIE (FEAT. AMANDA DIVA)

Get down 
(make it easy) 
good God make it easier now 
(good God make it easier now) 
Get down 
(man and woman get down) 
good God make it easier now 
(good God make it easier now) 
Get down 
(man and woman get down) 
a dooga dooga dooga dooga duh doo 

Man and woman be patrollin the earth 
puttin shit in the game 
citizens of the world, we runnin out 

precious time is a grain of sand 
ignored by the hand 
(work hard man everyday) 
work hard man everyday 
(for who?) for another man's plan 

man orders woman when he come how 
get your ass in the air 
(my woman wants it just as much as I do) 
woman wants it just as much as he does 
but makes as if she don't care 

man and woman in this thing where I'm from 
be havin things on their mind 
minimum wage and the internet page (she cry) 
protect themselves from crime 

the bluest collar on the brownest of skin 
white, yellow, red too 
they don't care who it is, they watchin you 

conspiracies so you might as well dance 
gettin down Zulu 
man/woman yeah you might as well dance 
gettin down Zulu 
c'mon, c'mon 

(chorus) 
gettin down is somethin between 
woman and man 
one minute we're so far apart and then 
together we stand 

gettin down is somethin between 
woman and man 
one minute we're so far apart and then 
together we stand 

men and women what's goin on inside our minds 
oh no, sing it one more time c'mon 

gettin down is somethin between 
woman and man 
one minute we're so far apart and then 
together we stand 

check it out 
red man was the first on the continent 
this you gotta understand 
woman not behind him, she's right beside him there 
and they both toil land 

white man fightin for independence from 
an old empire 
woman makes a flag for a new nation and 
let's the flag waves high 

black woman is stripped of her kingdom and 
bought the breastfeeding new 
black man, mentally, he broke it too 
but the cream always rise to the top 
that's what men and women do 

man/woman always doin the dance 
one wops, one pops 
we'd be lucky if we both found a groove 
that we both can lock 

can man be stronger if a woman is there? 
I would have to say yes 
can women make it without men being there? 
she would have to be blessed 

woman and man are the spiritual forces 
brought together to live 
good thing its many of us here in the world today 
find a good one to give 
let's go, c'mon 

good God make it easier now 
get down 
good God make it easier now 
get down 
a dooga dooga dooga dooga duh doo 
get down
