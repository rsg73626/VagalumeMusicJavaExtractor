DANCE ON GLASS

The people at the label say they want something to repeat 
But all my people really want something for the streets 
So keep hooking 
Hey ya'll what's goin on? 
So keep hooking 
It's time yo word is bond 
So keep hooking 
Let's do what we must do 
So keep hooking 
ah ah ah let's hear for 
Keep keep 
Who can make it up, dark age is here in rap 
And the constant conversation has been let's bring it back 
Corny rap style niggas they lack the pedigree 
Deep waters they be in when they just a manatee 
Who me I'm unaffected the Whale, the Hammerhead 
The Magnanimous decision, unanimous, I am fed 
What chu looking at, wait, I can help you with that 
The Formidable, unforgettable painting Abstract 
In the wall amongst them all from Tucson Michelle 
A commodity, hot property, hears the morning bell 
Guantanama bayin niggas deferring routes 
Ya soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout 
Homie, whats that about? You should revisit your scheme 
Before the scheme that seems real, reverts back to a dream 
Into that pea head of yours 
You aint commanding no tours 
You seeing fee per deim 
We seeing that in the doors 
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest 
Though while they is wittiest 
On the low we the grittiest 
Taking the task, these barbaric insurgents 
From nursery rhyme niggas and play like they crime figures 
Man, what could give you such a naive belief? 
There's examples all around of careers being brief 
The Luke Cage of the loose leaf page 
Run and hide, comin out in the yard 
Bonafied to be hard 

So keep hooking 
Keep hooking 
Keep hooking 
Keep hooking 
Keep keep 
So Keep hooking 
Keep hooking 
Keep hooking 
Keep hooking 
Keep keep 
As if we reading pressures higher 
We should all be that inspired 
Too just lift it, take it higher 
Peep the name that's on the flyer 
The Midnight Marauder, low end theoretical 
Ring tone rappers rockin shades are forgettable 
Phantom of the rap world boo 
Yo you puss in boots 
Energy electricutes, looking for a love recruit 
High definition for the fortunate you to view 
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review 
Time to turn the tide around 
Comin with the tribal sound 
Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town 
Corruption in the pool pit, we witness the jam 
Acquisition of materials the evil of man 
Trickles down to MC's 
We combat the disease 
With the good and hardy measurement 
A real rap sediment 
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host 
You need to open up wide while we give you the dose 

Gather round 
Gather round 
Gather round 
It's the hottest thing 
Gather round 
Gather round 
Gather round 
It's the hottest thing
