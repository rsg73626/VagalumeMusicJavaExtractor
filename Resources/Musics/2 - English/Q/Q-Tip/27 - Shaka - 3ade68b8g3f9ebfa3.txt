SHAKA

My brother Shaka would have wanted me to do it like this 
so raise the glasses for all the lost ones in your life. 

Dilla dawg and master wow, what up with emmy, 
is well to propel with the spirit of the mic. 

Even if you have one person with you when its hard, 
that makes it easy, celebrate them let know just who they are. 

Because of these experiences i have some control 
on the microphone and roll elevating to the stars. 

Hers a demonstration, with the excellence, 
reverse the pandemic thats filled with pestilence. 
Who has his finger on the post of the b-boy 
Serving fees with the stream of a deep boy. 
Whose well connected, you must respect it 
I'm dippin with the spirits mentioned on this record. 
Hopefully this serves as motivation, 
the never sayin docon-sensation. 
Put my stamp on it, the mic clamps on it, 
Mama i know let me put little thamp on it. 
Blade running through the day of agility, 
staying gunning make way for possibilities. 
It's the capital Q, rap it'll do, 
what i want it to, its like taming a shrew. 
Living life experiencing proportions, 
knowing better, I've experienced distortions 
And through the in and outs, of life's revolving doors 
I'mma see that, I'm still getting more 
yeah im commin in, I'm gonna see my friend 
to the top floor, Seems it never ends 
Heaven never ends, yeah it never ends 
it be goin on, its phenomenon, like a new born 
or a Stevie song, it be going on, 
Do ya fell it... Do ya feel it... Do ya feel it? 

Snare drum goes... 

My Brother Shaka would have wanted me to say this to y'all, 
Don't lose sight y'all without giving a fight. 

Im channeling well and ervine, Mr. clean 
he would have wanted me to say what I mean, and mean get it right 

Dilla having you in my past has been a blast, 
you've inspired so many and forever will you last. 

And to my father yo your spirit is draping me, 
never escaping me, i'm happy that i had you in my past 

lets go... lets go 

lets go... lets go 

lets go... lets go
