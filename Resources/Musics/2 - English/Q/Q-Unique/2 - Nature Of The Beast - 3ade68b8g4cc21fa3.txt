NATURE OF THE BEAST

[verse 1]
Killers assassinated the topman on the block
And this the motherfucker who taught me all about the rock
So i took a leaver babsens from my prior engagement
His mother crying on the phone over the funeral arrangements
I'm at the wake, full of anger and i'm nervous
A whole lot of sideways, niggaz hanging around for the service
Some other scumbag from across town
Send these little soldiers with a message "your mans down and your lost now"
In other words he's trying to take over the territory ??
"nobody get any funny ideas" he said in a warning
We draw heat, bitches screaming, niggaz running for cover
I'm frozen, one of these snakes got a gun to his mother
The eye ignite here, i release the pistols clip
My sight - not clear, cause i take a pistol whip
I wake up in the bed with a bandage on my head
Looking at the sistof the beginning of the story of the man that was dead
The whole crews in the room and they like "you gotta leave town"
And i'm like "i ain't branching off untill i take these weeds down"
I'm out for revenge and i'll doubt that i bend
They're gonna get cut and rolled into the credits 'cause this about to be the end

[hook x2]
And it don't stop 'till they get the man on top
Plans on lock for the next on top

It's the nature of the streets, the nature of the beast
Let nature take it's course and then the boss will get diseased

[beat changes and several movie samples are playing]

It's just a matter of time, before i get to take the topman down
It's just a babylon crime, before the cops are let the glocks clip round

[verse 2]
I'm watching the activity in the boom room
Studying the proximity imma spass with the tools soon
Gotta keep calm, put the glock on lock to stop from trippin'
Watch the clock and snipe a shot, and they won't know what hit 'em
Then i got a two-way from ray who heard about the beef
Said there was things i needed to know and give me the word on the street
Word has it, it was an inside job and i won't shit ya
But all fingers pointing indirectionally your mans little sister
I think back to what it could have been that made her denim
It's plain and simple, he broke crack commandment number seven
I'm faced with a decision before i take out the rang passle
And punish them in the name of chris rios and frank castle
I got to the scumbag sitting next to my mans sister
Shots popped the topman but my nervous ?? missed her
It was a scene out of an old west flick and i run with the draw
Dropped the gun, watched the blood drip then i slipped off

[beat changes back]

[hook x2]
And it don't stop 'till they get the man on top
Plans on lock for the next on top

It's the nature of the streets, the nature of the beast
Let nature take it's course and then the boss will get disease
