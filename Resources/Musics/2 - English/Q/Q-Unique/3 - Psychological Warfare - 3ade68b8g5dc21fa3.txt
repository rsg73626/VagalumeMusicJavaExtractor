PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE

the 6’oclock news got me paranoid, 
suspicious of any tan man who walks with a turban
think the mans plans to have new york burnin
so i spit the blam blam where he stores his learnin
and y’all can blame the newscaster
while i aim for a new disaster, an arab name is who i’m after
american history’s new chapter
the end, defendin a mystery of a fools matter
george bush comes up, and the towers come down
george bush runs amuck, and the power goes down
george bush don’t give a fuck, as the hour comes around
so george bush gets bucked as i shower off a round
a man’s clapped for his causes
and send an instant message cause theres anthraxx in the post office
i’m tryin to put a pack in both bosses
sadamm and george w, celebrity ghost corpses

hook: 
psychological warfare...it doesn’t matter get them all scared
psychological lies…it doesn’t matter let them die
psychological warfare...it doesn’t matter get them all scared
psychological lies…it doesn’t matter let them all die

2nd verse
i hailed a yellow cab on mac street and maccobe
and left a time bomb in the back seat to explode
for the agent dispatching the code
and for the taliban man who did exactly what he was told
made my way to the fbi lobby
in a bullet proof with 2 semi automatics on me
splattered them in a manner that was ungodly
and showed the federal party what i learned playin atari
now i’m hittin the 6’oclock news desk
and gave kaity tong 2 bullet wounds to her chest
snatched up tom browkaw, the blam poked his jaw
the desert storm before the calm is what he saw
that’s for ya fuckin terror alert warning and…
that’s for always showin the world trade fallin and.. 
that’s for makin people look evil in palastine and…
that’s for blamin hip hop for every street crime

hook: 
psychological warfare...it doesn’t matter get them all scared
psychological lies…it doesn’t matter let them die
psychological warfare...it doesn’t matter get them all scared
psychological lies…it doesn’t matter let them all die

3rd verse
i’m in a war fightin the law knowin i gotta rhyme
unsightful core and i’m controllin ya hollow mind
despite the wall i’m showin ya how to climb
standin with michael more bowlin for colombine
they grip you with fear, then spit death in ya ear
shed a tear for them to quit, and they’ll put lead in ya rear
i thought we was after bin ladden, now we savin iraq
fought terror with bombin they keep changin the facts
take the money from health care, put it towards warfare
draft the nigas on welfare and kill ‘em off there
the government searches iraq for weapons and bomb threats
same government put crack and weapons in the projects
bagdad bob the histerical threat
another joke, hey george…find any chemical weapons yet? 
wanted to steal the oil from sadaam was the plan, using god as a scam
it’s just a vietnam in the sand

hook: 
psychological warfare...it doesn’t matter get them all scared
psychological lies…it doesn’t matter let them die
psychological warfare...it doesn’t matter get them all scared
psychological lies…it doesn’t matter let them all die
