FATHER'S DAY

i’m sittin in the room with a knife in my hand 
with a plan all night to take the life of a man
a soul with a dark heart and the devil in his eyes
provider and father figure, high level of disguise
he had the neighborhood fooled with his fatherly act
they didn’t know how he left us in a poverty trap
didn’t know his angry fist went across mommies face
or his two timing ways left my mother a disgrace
no one knew how he put fear into his family
his temper angered rage was damn near insanity
tragically it came to this
it’s ether him, or the blade cut across my vein that 
would drain my wrist
tonight, and end to all the pain and fear
and the csi is left clueless and my name is clear
too many unanswered prayers and i lost faith rapidly
scream to the sky, why did god turn his back on me

hook (2x’s) 
i killed a man on fathers day, god forbid me, 
i sent a man on his way, god forgive me
lord have mercy on my soul, when the hurts beyond control
the demons in my mind are gonna haunt me till i’m cold

2nd verse
do you know what it’s like to have fear sit in the pit of ya stomach
with severe punishment as if he loved it
my heart races as i grab the knife tighter
and pray for the strength that i can make his life expire
i’m tense and on the edge and my strife is dire
and to protect myself i live my life as a liar
it was all those fuckin’ beatings that gave me lies
and he thought that beatingme up would make me wise
and i got smacked if i stood brave
he’d puff weed in my face screamin’ behave and get good grades
the wounds reflected through the mirror in the bathroom
and i could’nt connect with anyone sittin’ in the classroom
you fucked me up bad man, and you chuckle like you glad
smile across ya face but i’ll have the last laugh
it’s your 1st born with a heart full of enmity
holdin the shank razor sharp kill the enemy
hook (2x’s) 
i killed a man on fathers day, god forbid me, 
i sent a man on his way, god forgive me
lord have mercy on my soul, when the hurts beyond control
the demons in my mind are gonna haunt me till i’m cold

3rd verse: 
my anger’s getting the best of me
while the devil posses the rest of me
my little brother’s an accessory
i’ve been robbed of my childhood and self esteem
a life limited by a selfish feind
manipulated my mind and said mother was worthless
when he’s home from work i’m not glad i’m nervous
it’s fear of that unknown momment
when his anger can snap and he can no longer 
control it or hold it vengence is mine despite what sayeth the lord
it’s the end of the line and i smite and slay with a sword
the kitchen knife spits his life on to the bedroom floor
his twitchin life slips and then no more
it’s finally finished, i found freedom in the form of a fallen demon
sit and explore a reason
ya had a chance to redeem ya self and it got away
and i laugh at you bleedin fucker, happy fathers day

hook (2x’s) 
i killed a man on fathers day, god forbid me, 
i sent a man on his way, god forgive me
lord have mercy on my soul, when the hurts beyond 
control the demons in my mind are gonna haunt me till i’m cold
