GETTING AWAY

Time's breathing down my neck
I guess it's too late now
but I got to get somewhere somehow
I don't want this to end
I don't want no paradise
just to realize

(Coro)
Getting away trying to feel alive
healing this hurt inside
breathing in the air
I'm doing it again
gretting away drying up all the tears
burning down my fears
'til I find it

I'm fighting my way in
one more reason to bleed
but that is something you won't see

Scattered in the wind
with no control of my life
I just can't lie

(Coro)
Getting away trying to feel alive
healing this hurt inside
breathing in the air
I'm doing it again
gretting away drying up all the tears
burning down my fears
'til I find it
