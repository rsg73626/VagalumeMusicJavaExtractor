ONE LAST TIME

Don't bother I don't wanna hear it
don't even dare to think about it
I know what's one your mind
and that is just not right
I won't give in
this is what want for real

This is what want for real

(Coro)
Breathe deep and try again
one last time
filling the empiness
one last time

I'm breaking, breaking into pieces
I whan't it 'cause I'm addicted
I need this all the time
to help me realize
you're what I feel
this is what I want for real

This is what want for real

(Coro)
Breathe deep and try again
one last time
filling the empiness
one last time

You know got, you know I got
One last chance, One las chance
