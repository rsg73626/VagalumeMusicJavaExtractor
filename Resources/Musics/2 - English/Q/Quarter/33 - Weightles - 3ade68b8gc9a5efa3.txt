WEIGHTLES

Manage me
I'm a mess
Turn a page
I'm a book half unread
I want to be laughed at,
Laughed with
Just because
I want to feel weightless
And that should be enough

But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a second hand pick-me-up
And I'm over getting older
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
This is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

Make believe
That I impress,
That every word
By design turns a head

I wanna feel reckless
Wanna live it up
Just because
I want to feel weightless
'cause that would be enough

If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
This is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

This could be all I've waited for
This could be everything and I don't want to dream anymore

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here...

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
This is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here
