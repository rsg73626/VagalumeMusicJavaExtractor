TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

I can't let go, but the memories that we use to share.
My heart use to be so strong, please come back.
I love you girl, you know i need your love.
I never thought that you would break my heart.

You said you loved me girl from the start, and now your gone.
And i don't know what to do.
I am alone, but still in love with you.
Tell me that you love me, and you are here to stay.

I don't never want to see you go away.
Tell me that you love me, and our love is true.
Girl i know i never stop loving you, you been gone.
I been alone all alone.

I cry all night, and I wait by the phone.
I don't know why you feel this way.
These feelings for you girl.
I can't explain.

I never thought you will break my heart.
You said you loved me girl, right from the start.
And know your gone.
I don't know what to do.

I am all alone, and still in love with you.
