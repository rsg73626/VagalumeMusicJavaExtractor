DOWNFALL

Gone
Is the early blossom
Along with all those springs
That you have missed
And noone will ever pay
For your pain
All needlessly taken
Force yourself to shut your eyes
Let it grow inside
Rip its way out
Hate
A loathsome heritage
Poor man’s delight

Ensorcelled by visionary horizons
You rush for and almost kiss the sky
Surrounded by glaring sober light
We just stand there wordless
And witness your fall

Fall into the depths of guilt
Bare the immense horror of the unknown
Plunge into the see of conscience
Where no man stands tall
Will you ever reach its shores

Gone
Are the early years
Along with all those dreams
That have kept you alive
And noone will ever pay
For your pain
All that you took for its intense thrive
Force yourself to shut your eyes
Let it grow inside
Rip its way out
Hate
A loathsome heritage
An unbearable burden
The venomous seed

Poor man’s delight
