PARASITE

Silence
Gather around me
Quiet down and stand in line
Will you force me with your ruthless stare
Come kill your shepherd with a scornful smile

Silence
Reorder a distracted mind
On your kness
Cleanse me from this racking doubt
Shivering in delirium
Bereft of hope

Cease my torture

Leave me
Get away from me
I’ve sown my fields with salt
I have burnt my shelter
Let me take a good deep breath
Bring me relief
Cease my torture
Get away from me

Now in constant fear
Lose all that I’ve ever been
Face what is left of me
Without you
Obsessive thoughts
Unleash me

Leave me
Get away from me
I have spewed out
All your joyous filth
Put an end to my longing
Bring me relief
Cease my torture
Leave or kill me

Silence
Unleash me
