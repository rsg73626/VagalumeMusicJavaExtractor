ESCAPE

Now as the nails brake through my palms
Leave me orphaned soul
Tear your earthly chains
Rise up from your carnal gaul

Mistrustful as a wounded beast
In piercing cold of a new dayâ€™s dawn
Quivering in filth, sweat, and blood
Worn out in rabid, sensless run

Gasp for air
Leave those miserable thoughts
Filled with delirious rage
Soaked in bitter remorse

Devoured by remorse

Numb with fever
Daydreams of bliss
Hurtful pictures
Of long gone days

Now as the nails brake through my palms
Leave me orphaned soul
Tear your earthly chains
Rise up from your carnal gaul
