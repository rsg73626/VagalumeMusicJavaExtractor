¼ LIFE CRISIS

Worry plays and lays real heavy on my mind
I worry about if this world is ever gonna be alright
If she will ever put down her glasses of wine
If he will learn to let his stubborn male pride
While I remain unsatisfied inside 
About demons they pound at my door every night
I worry if I'm ever gonna be able to do it right
And if go wrong will I notice or be blind?
I try not to lie to anyone but me
Honesty plays host to my integrity
Standing near me you'll feel new energy
Accepting consequences and responsibilities
There's no key, guide, map or secret
Just look at yourself for real but don't dream it
Take those emotions now, begin to feel it
Think it, say it, do it, be it.

HOOK
This is my ¼ life crisis 
I'm slowly finding
Knowledge through rhyming
Ain't about the stylin'
It's all about climbing up out of this hell
And tryna find some faith in myself

I can't remember clearly most of my younger days
My memories are blurred opaque and all fazed
Sounds and smells throw me back to times I'd forgotten
Before I had credit, pubic hair and was hip-hopin' 
Childhood is all you ever knew in your life
Then you are an adult with no manual help or guide
Suddenly you hit about the age of 25
You now realise with some experiences on your side 
That life ain't easy and it works much differently
It feels like it smiles at the same time it's kicking me
Struggling real hard with debt and money management
Tryna change the unchangeable factors of my environment
For so long now I've been steady fighting 
When I should have been rhyming, being not trying
I feel like we're trapped in the cage we build ourselves
And why do I smoke if it's bad for my health

REPEAT HOOK

Power is given unto you so great
Tangible fantasy is what you can create
Lead a better life with only one rule
Love you. Love me. Love us. Love all
Let positivity start right here with you
It don't matter if you couldn't fit on the tube
Or if he accidentally stepped on the back of your shoe
Or when she's being unnecessarily rude
Be true to your self and work on accepting
Life is remembering not learning a lesson
These words I write mean nothing as real
As the thoughts, experiences and feelings I feel
Words are just versions of these true three
Let expectancy be your psychology
Gotta keep going don't get down and depressed
Sit there unwashed not eaten not dressed 
Look at life fresh, approach new angles
Learn to be less so emotionally tangled
Get up, get out and change all into positive
You've the power to do whatever your heart may wish
Let no one tell you different, they haven't realised
That you're as grand as the sea land or sky
So very beautiful like a dew covered rose
And as special as the first day this I do know 

REPEAT HOOK
