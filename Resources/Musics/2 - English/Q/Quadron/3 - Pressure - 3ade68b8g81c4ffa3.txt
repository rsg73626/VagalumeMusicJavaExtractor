PRESSURE

I've been trying
To get you under my pressure

I've been trying to hurt you
For as long as I can remember
Looking for the spineless point
And change your summer into winter
When I look into your deepest
I see myself at my weakest
I am walking deep waters
To burn your spendid and virtuous bridges

But you said
Show show show
But I won't
Grow grow grow

I've been trying
To get your under my pressure

You've accepted my crimes
As if you knew they were coming
Like nicking candy from a kid
You been defeating my verbal beatings
No, I won't stop my torture
Until you show you got tears too
I'd rather you deal with your temper
Than feel your careless empathy

But you said
Show show show...
