SLIPPIN

I was demanding to be all so strong
But truth be told I only want myself to tag along
Following my shadow, loaded with guilt
What I didn't know was patching up and makes a quilt
Too much pleasure from illusions of right
It seems I'd rather lose a friend then a fight
But I'm young enough to know everything
What I do know is
My alter ego is up-coming

I'm slippin'
'Cause I can't get me off of this throne
I'm slippin'
It's too much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin'
'Cause I can't get me off of this throne
It's too much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin'
I'm slippin'

Use persuasion as my strongest approach
I preach my wisdom as a neat friendly poach
If respect you don't get, it's something you owe
If you can't do what I do it's 'cause
You reap what you sow
Taking my time sharing my week
Yeah, Iâ€™m good at listening when I hear myself speak
Once I swell attention tasted
Enough won't do every weekend I am wasted

I'm slippin'
'Cause I can't get me off of this throne
I'm slippin'
It's too much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin'
'Cause I can't get me off of this throne
It's too much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin'
I'm slippin'

Once I swell attention tasted
Enough won't do every weekend I am wasted
