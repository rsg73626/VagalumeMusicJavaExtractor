BUSTER KEATON

Full blood veggie dressed in fur
And your beliefs are in a blur
The benetton colors are so true
Just not on the beach next to you
Maybe its time for some self interrogation
But you already chose your final destination
Saving the whales during the day
But at night your making them pay

This is why
You think you're on track
And never falling back
Tell your little conscience that
You think you're on track
And never falling back

You can't keep on preachin'
Like its your sunday meetin'
Its to buster keaton
Maybe theres is no eden

Girl, you acting like you still have your corporate
Virginity
But there is always a cross for you to bear
Politically correct about everything besides yourself
If you could buy a perfume of it you would

This is why
You think you're on track
And never falling back
Tell your little conscience that
You think you're on track
And never falling back

You can't keep on preachin'
Like its your sunday meetin'
Its to buster keaton
Maybe theres is no eden

Check it out
Take it all
Take it all
Take it from your all
