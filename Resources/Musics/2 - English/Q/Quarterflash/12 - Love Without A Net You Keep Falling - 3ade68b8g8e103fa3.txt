LOVE WITHOUT A NET YOU KEEP FALLING

Climb the stairs, take his hand
Take his word, there's a place to land
So you weigh the risk of another fall
But you heed the moon when you hear her call
And up on the roof and out on the ledge
You let go to love, and you step off the edge...

Oh...you keep falling you give your love away
Oh...you keep falling in love without a net
You use your heart to break your fall

Like a dream lights go down
Crowds below never make a sound
And you want to run but you need to fly
And you fall again, but you close your eyes
And up on the wire, alone on the stand
You let go to love, but there's nowhere to land

Oh...you keep falling you give your love away
Oh...you keep falling in love without a net
You use your heart to break your fall

Love's no gift, love will end
You learn to fall and you learn to bend
And your diamond wings break like glass 
You jump again just to see what happens...

Oh...you keep falling you give your love away
Oh...you keep falling in love without a net
You use your heart to break your fall
