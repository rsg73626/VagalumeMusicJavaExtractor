'cause I bought her bags and a bing roo
And I put them diamonds in them bengals

Like the way she take them pictures,
 It's the angle (flash)
Like the way she keep her business all personal
You know, you know,
 You know, you fit me
You get me,
 You get me, you get me
Drop off, your old boy, then get with me
Heard it's slippery (splash)
Heard it's wet like seaweed (splash)
Moonwalking on slabs (moon)
She live life like babs
Nails and hair all long,
 Shoppin' spree in hong kong
Ass fat in her jeans,
 She don't like to wear thong
She gon' make you sing this song
Is she for keeps?
Pour this drink for me
Smoke this dope for me
Drive around with me, ayy
Just for keepsake (keepsake)

Perfect, nobody's perfect
My body's perfect, bitch I'm perfect
Somebody lied, just watch me murk it
I'ma murk it, bitches my sons,
 I used a surrogate
Got 'em hurting,
 He know for certain, cop me that birkin
Baby nervous, I make 'em nervous,
 I make 'em nervous
When them bum bitches in my town
All my real niggas alerted
He say, "damn baby, you bad, "
I say, "I commit murders"
When the block starts to get hot
He know I'll hide his burners
I'm from keeps, I am for keeps,
 She can't compete
He ain't stupid enough to lose me
To another nigga in them streets
Ooh, they salty,
 I know they salty
Please say the barbie, he say the barbie
I'm the bad bitch
 That all the bad bitches fuck with
She a mad bitch
 If she ain't fuckin' with me, suck dick
This piece flooded out cost about a buck six
Pull up on a bum bitch and be like what up sis?
Rap bitches is on my nuts,
 Call 'em chip 'n' dale
These bitches can't see me
They should all be reading braille
Pull off in that gt
 With some seagram's ginger ale
Tell that bitch I'm oprah,
 She couldn't even be gayle
I'm me, when will these girls ever see?
You will never be nicki,
 And that's the real key-key
Ki-ki, ki-ki

Somebody tell me is she (somebody tell)
