GOODBYE HORSES

Hoooooooooooo
Hooooo-hooooooo
Hoooooo-hooooooo

You told me, I see you rise
But, it always, falls
I see you come, I see you go

You say, "all things pass, into the night"
And I say, "oh no sir, I must say
 You're wrong,
 I must disagree, oh no sir,
 I must say you're wrong"
Won't you listen to me

You told me, I've seen it all before
I've been there,
I've seen my hopes and dreams
 A-lying on the ground

I've seen the sky, just begin to fall
And you say, "all things pass, into the night"
And I say, "oh no sir, I must say
 You're wrong,
 I must disagree, oh no sir, 
I must say you're wrong"
Won't you listen to me?

Good-bye horses
I'm lying over you
Good-bye horses
I'm lying over you
Good-bye horses
I'm lying over you
Good-bye horses
I'm lying, lying, lying over you...
