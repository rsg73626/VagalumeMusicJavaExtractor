THAT DREAM

[Verse 1]
Back in '88 the little neighborhood terror
Started writin' rhymes back in hip hops golden era
Middle school hallways was bustin' a flow
I used to go by the name of emcee Snow
The music was a way to escape my pain
In the box was Rah Kim or maybe Big Daddy Kane
As the years progressed I kept ownin' my craft
Bus stop kids would laugh white kids cant rap
My voice soundin' funny I was end the midst of puberty
And this whole hip hoppin' rap shit was new to me
1990 made a demo age of 15
It was my dream to just bust on the scene
Flat top fade, with the lines and designs
Rockin' hammer pants was the style at the time
Kickin' my rhymes to anybody that would listen
My moms had my back and gave supportive criticism
1992 I started rollin' wit a crew
My name was Mist Jinx and my partner Doc Seuss
1993 bumpin' Tribe Called Quest
Playin' hooky downtown fuck a history test
I had the cross colors gear with the hair up in dreads
And my friends, knuckleheads we was all good kids
Rappin' over instrumental records on a cassette
We ain't had no equipment if we did we'd be set
'94 was the year moms passed on
Bouncin' place to place just tryin' to find a home
I Hooked up with JayD and Mo Duce and Nine 5
3rd floor productions man we dropped comin' live

[Chorus]
No matter what as the years went on
I couldn't stop just writing these songs
When nothin' went right and everything went wrong
Used the music to just keep on
Never gonna stop no I must succeed
Never gonna happen if I don't believe
I got goals that I gotta achieve
And until I do I'll never lose that dream

[Verse 2]
3rd Floor Productions and the group iLLriginals
Makin' phat tracks every week was the ritual
Doin' shows while we could good while it lasted
But 1997 though I guess we just had it
All lost touch and Mo just passed too
JayD is still reppen with the Birthright Crew
And around this time I felt I needed a change
I need to somethin' different wit a whole new name
It was extreme I admit, it was a bit different
Q Strange, murderous rap wit the sick shit
Did murder kill people couldn't believe
That that kid Mista Jinx just changed his whole steez
Did a couple of tracks and put it out on dubs
And the heavy metal freak show these kids'll love
In '98 I hooked up wit this kid name Hex
The crew L.U. Cipha was the group that he repped
He heard my tape man he was diggin' the shit
Told his kid Slowkill and his girl named Jill
The next thing I know they got that shit online
They had a web page, thought I'd hit the big time
Anyways '99 I put out Decayed Thoughts
Low budget style though shit I was poor
In the year 2g I dropped C to E
Now mad kids are bumpin' me coppin my CD
Get mail, cats overseas gimme props
Blow my mind every time, party never stops
Still just strivin', strugglin', in the game
Hopin' I can get some shit out and make a name
For myself, only way I'll ever get the wealth
Cruz this is all I do I thank yall for my help
Now it's 2003 mad shit done changed
I been married, separated, got a son that ????
But no matter what this music shit is still with me
And if rap is still 'round I'll be flowin' when I'm fifty
Underground, mainstream, wanna be on the scene
But for now I can close my eyes and just dream

[Chorus] - 4X
