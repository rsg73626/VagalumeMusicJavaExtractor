MORBID LULLABIES

[Chorus]
Sweet dreams close your eyes
Listin to these morbid lullabies
Waken up in cold sweats in the middle of the night
Nightmares nightmares got you all a-fright

[repeat Chorus]

Hope of sweet dreams I go to bed and close my eye lids
Instead I'm having visions images of gothic violence
I'm in a realm of darkness
Scared but can't stop this
Tossing and turning
On a blood stained carpet
Cant sleep
I close my eyes I hear screams
Morbid lullabies give my mind bad dreams
I'm seein blood splattered
Body parts scattered
Clinging to picture she no torn and tattered
And yo I'm mad and I've had it
And now myself should be pattered
And no I'm dreaming of a victim all beaten and battered
And as these faces of death they haunt my nightmares
My worst fears invading my brains sphere
Pains severe
As my heart pounds right through my chest
Years sense I've had a good rest
Depressed
Visions of death are now rotting like flesh
Voices in my head put my mind to the test
Time to reflect on the shit I did wrong
By this time tomorrow ill be gone
I still don't give a fuck
And I have no remorse
I'm dreaming of my body being turned into a corpse
Envisioning my soul rotting in the flames of hell
I don't wonna die or stay in this cell
But I don't got a choice
I gotta pay the price
Seein hellish bodies all sliced
Faces with no eyeballs in the sockets
Chasing me down as I flee into the darkness
The unknown
My minds in a zone and I'm froze
To just sit and let these sick thoughts roam

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Angels and demons play tug of war with my soul
I've lost control
eternal bliss is my goal
I fold under pressure cause this life that I treasure
Is in a parallel dimension that's beyond human measure
Purgatory unsure where else in eternity
Embracing life but still flames are burning me
I'm turning the page to the next chapter of life
Cause after your life on earth ain't even half of your life
Its like passin the mic in infinite eternal cipher
Each emcee representing a new life
I deal with jealousy hate guilt and anger
Wanna make to higher ground but I'm in danger
Of negativity consuming my whole being
Corroding my soul with all the misery I'm seeing
I'm fleeing this rotting human shell forever
Demons chewing on my mind trying to sever
I touch with reality in my rationality
Now I'm battling multiple personalities - personalities
I can't sleep

[Chorus] - repeat 3X
