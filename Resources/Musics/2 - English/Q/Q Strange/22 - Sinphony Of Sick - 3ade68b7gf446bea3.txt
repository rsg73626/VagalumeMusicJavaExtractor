SINPHONY OF SICK

Makin' precision incisions, with it this talent I'm givin'
Didn't know how to keep livin' so I just started the killin'
Sick in the head when I'm sinnin' ILLin infectin' I'm stickin'
My knife in you and I'm grinnin' sittin' and thinkin' of quitin'
But I continue my mission listen to voices here within
Sayin' its just the beginning don't know what's really pretendin'
It's hard to decide when the mind is divided and hided
From the reality battling the evilness inside of me
My mind is it dieing, I'm crying I'm trying not to lose it
Confusing abusing I'm bruising your skull until its oozing
I'm choosin' my weapon I'm gettin' I'm settin'
I'm lettin' aggression set into my nerve endings
Awww, can't take the pain no more
Stain the floor with blood guts and crazy gore
Waiting for the day god repays me for
All the sinful things I did that he hates me for (Uh)

[Verse 2]
This disease has me blinded and I can't see the light
Live in darkness while my sanity continues to fight
With little bit I have left I use it to blend
With this fucked up society that lied to me again
I have a hatred for the world I cant describe
I've strive to stay alive but it's hard to survive
Darken my eyes, from all the insomnia I suffer
Cant sleep for weeks and it keeps gettin' tougher
The more I don't rest the more I'm gettin' depressed
And obsessed with the sight of another persons death
I regret what I did when it's just too late
I even ate human steaks and eyeballs like grapes
It's a big mistake, but the mind knows know boundaries
It's been years and still the police never found me
Astounding with technology and forensics
And experts and people who have these sixth senses
I guess its depression that I have Gods blessing
If he wanted me to stop I would've seen some detectives
Decrepit, Decayed, Morbid my brain
It's all them things and it's rotting away
And starting today, I'm gonna try and stop all the killing
Aw, whom I kiddin'? It's only the beginning
I like to cut em open and see what makes them tick
And rhyme about it like this cuz it makes you sick

[Verse 3]
My sinphony, conjures up images of misery
Picture thee crime scene photos of the grisly
Ax I portray on a day to day
I came to say, I won't stop till this pains away
My brains decay, and eating at my thoughts I can feel it
There's a rat inside my head nawing at my spirit
I can hear it, chewing on my cerebral cortex
Crawling its way tryin' to escape outta my forehead
Your all dead, zombies try to walk among the living
As I'm sitting there's a choir in my mind and it's singing
An orchestra of madness, sinphony of sickness
Philharmonic illness, Nirvana when I feel this
Melodic and I feel bliss, Schizophrenic realness
I'm unstoppable horrible and I'm fearless
My lyrics are a cry for help cant you hear this
I'm a danger to society and I'm careless
A tickin' time bomb just waitin' to detonate
So get it straight, I don't rap about my jewelry and escalade
I'm swept away by the evil that some how got into me
Years from now you'll see its prophetic in my sinphony

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Don't know what got into me
I just show how it could be
Why am I so sick, you see
In the meanest Sinphony
