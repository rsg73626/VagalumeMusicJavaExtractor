HAPPY HOME

[Verse 1]
Just seventeen when I metchu
Yeah you, we were young but cha knew what I been through
Ita fucked up if we meant to
But I was your friend tried to protect you
Plus I knew you had potential
Had a good heart and was set to mend to
Known as a hoe and got laughed at
But I was a man, and I saw right past that
You were better than that, so I aimed you
In the right direction a gaurdian angel
Even though I wasnt heaven sent
Had to take you outta that bad bad element
I admit I was hesitant
To give you my heart but you know I had to represent
I had to show you there was more to life
Show you da light that was sorta nice
I knew you had issues
And there was some shit that you had been through
Tried my best to understand
All I ever wanted was to be ya man
Had no self esteem and was insecure
Wipe'en tears and reassure
Tell you that your beautiful
Special and Unusual
Much more than just doable
Deserved the world and you knew it too
Put up with ya jealous rage
Flipouts and abusive stage
Thru it all I always stayed
By your side you were amazed
Didn't know why but I couldnt say
Just took it all like day to day
Wanted the ring so I copped that
You want a new car so I bought that
You wanted a kid, yo I got that
Now you wanna crib so I bought that
Everything in the world that your heart desired
I gave to you, I sacrificed
Anything to see you smile
Ya happiness just drove me wild

[Chorus]
How could this happen to my happy home
How could you tear the heart out my soul
Why am I the one whose all alone
When I did everything just to make you happy

How could this happen to my happy home
How could you tear the heart out my soul
How could you be so damn cold
When all I ever did was try to make you happy

[Verse 2]
Moved real fast in marryment
Things did move like kinda quick
Engaged, married, now a kid
That was the base of my happiness
I worked for mine, and tried to provide for my family and I'm filled with pride
I scarificed every job that you didnt like
Just to make you happy, but it didnt right
I letchu go and work for us
You pay the bills, I'll raise a son
I do what it takes to set it right
As long as we're together I'm set for life
Now you out wit around yo peers
See that you been wastin years
Thinkin that you missin life
No more girl, wanna be my wife
Takin number from these guys
Callin them to my surprise
Then I see you gotta man
Cheatin lyin all damn
It hurt me
When I found that night about the show in Jersey
That you and ya man was in my home
Makin love to the break of dawn
After all I've done for you
Had nothin but love for you
Now you wanna go and get comfortable
With some strange dude who's fuckin you
Wanna take this life that we built from scratch
Throw it out the window and down the hatch
Flush it down the toilet just like that
Fuck you bitch I'm done with that
If I had a gat, I'da cocked the shit
Aimed it and just shot the shit
Killed you you obnoxious bitch
You and ya man I'm shocked and shit
Every night you dont come home
Findin numbers in your phone
Guess that I just shoulda known
That you'd leave me all alone
I trusted you, wit my heart
Now you tore my life apart
I aint got shit without you now
I can't move on I dont know how
I don't wanna live, I'd rather die
Than not have you here by my side
I wanna commit a double homicide
Then just fuckin suicide
Why did you do why?
Was it worth it?
See what you did I'm hurt bitch
Dont say you didnt do it on purpose
You wasnt sorry while suckin on a nerds dick
I sacrificed it all for you
So that you wouldn't be miserable
You one fucked up individual
I hope your new man shits on you!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
