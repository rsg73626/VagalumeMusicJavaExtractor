ILLRIGINA

Yeah Q Strange
Wit dat Illriginal Style

[Verse 1]
Reppin' deep subterranean, crazy up in the cranium
I'm lookin' mo' suspicious than Arabians with uranium
Flyin' low in the shuttle, I'm far from suttle
I'm gettin' stared at more than interracial couples
I run through airport gates wavin' guns too like fuck you
I come through, wanna blow dis bitch up too
Cuz Q, don't know how to deal with every day stress
I stay dressed in rags, and whack sneakers from payless
My paychecks are way less, than cats wit half the talent
My pockets slim and empty when they should be thick like Allen
Battlin' emcees and they all full of a player shook
Still I couldn't get signed with a pen and a yearbook

[Verse 2]
I'm in the house like I was on home confinement
Lyin' like my career would be shorter than Paul Simon
Never had the smarts to go and be and MD
But they should still call me Doogie cuz I Houser MCs
A thousand emcees, frontin' man they ain't sayin' nothin'
Just flappin' they lips and tellin' stories like Teddy Ruxpin
You ain't thugin' I don't care what your crew say
Heard me rhyme on Friday it didn't hit cha till Tuesday
You say alive I should come and see you rock
I did, you bout as live as Biggie Smalls and Tupac
Got a shoebox full of tongues keep as my trophies
From homies, I annihilated at the show, see?

[Verse 3]
You was a top dog yesterday man, it don't scare me
I'm here today like Matt Lower, and tomorrow like Annie
You fairy, pansy yo you shoulda tried plan b
My beats thump like that rabbit on bambi
Cant stand me, cuz you know that you ain't half as nice
So go fuck ya self, like a hermaphrodite
Pass the mic to me and piss mad kids off
I hog the shit for two hours they're like "dag get off"
I was in the cipher but I had to leave the circle
Watchin' me battle is like seein' Screech vs. Urkel
Verbal, mutilation, slaughter, man just accept it
You pass me the mic, big mistake, yall shoulda kept it
