[quanie cash]
Quanie cash i represent the real (aight)
Nationwide straight out of nashville (aight)
See my big body parked outside (aight)
Dont believe me watch me cock it when i drive (aight)
Around my way man we ridin chrome 20s (aight)
We aint gone talk about money cause i got plenty (aight)
Your mama lookin like she wanna get wit me (aight)
Probably cause i bling blingin and i'm shitty (aight)
Bandana round my head and i'm thuggin it (aight)
Somebody get in the wrong i'm a start bustin it (aight)
Shootin dice wit these niggas scared to bet me (aight)
Im tryin to come up i know yall gone let me (aight)
I represent my hood no matter what (aight)
Up in the club throwin it up gettin buc (aight)
Look a hater in the face then bounce (aight)
You got some grass then burn it by the ounce (aight)

Chorus

[d-smoov]
Im in the ride candy paint on the car (aight)
Niggas they hatin cause i'm hittin corners sharp (aight)
You think you slick wanna plot on me like you hard (aight)
But i'm a reach on my hip and serve you somethin hot (aight)
I be down bad when i fucking wit these hoes (aight)
I aint gone let em get me caught up no more (aight)
You think you slick wit the game but run it slow (aight)
So if you plottin on me bitch you gotta go (aight)
I got the cake and you aint gettin shit (aight)
They tryin to trick me into gettin a outfit (aight)
But i'm a southern nigga bottom boy kid (aight)
It take a summer just to understand a lick (aight)
Mob niggas type niggas i fuck wit (aight)
I never loved you bitch i just wanted to hit (aight)
So if its up to me you know what you gone get (aight)
But if you approach me bitch some big fat dick (aight)
