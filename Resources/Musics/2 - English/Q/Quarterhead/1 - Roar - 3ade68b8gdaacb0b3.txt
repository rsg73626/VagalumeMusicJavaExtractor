ROAR

Don't play with my vain
I am the one to tame
Like darkness crawling on ya
I fight with tooth and nails

Whip me with the golden leash
Gunpowder for the snoozing beast

Don't make the lion roar
We are fighting war

Love ain't no game
Cause the pain feels the same
Roar

Don't make the lion roar
We are fighting war

Love ain't no game
Cause the pain feels the same
Roar

Your words your risk
My thunder my fist
My aching soul overstrained
Watch me burst into flames

Whip me with the golden leash
Gunpowder for the snoozing beast

Don't make the lion roar
We are fighting war

Love ain't no game
Cause the pain feels the same
Roar

Don't make the lion roar
We are fighting war

Love ain't no game
Cause the pain feels the same
Roar

Don't make the lion roar
We are fighting war

Love ain't no game
Cause the pain feels the same
Roar

Don't make the lion roar
