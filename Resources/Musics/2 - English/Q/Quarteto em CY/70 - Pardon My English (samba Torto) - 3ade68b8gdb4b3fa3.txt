PARDON MY ENGLISH (SAMBA TORTO)

When you said goodbye, did I sit an' cry? Wanna go an' die? Oh! No Siree!

Made another wish . . . get another fish! Lot's of pretty fish . . . are in the sea!

You think that you're my one and only . . . Pardon my English, I ain't lonely!

Ain't about to brood . . . in a happy mood! Even sat and booed . . . your photographs!

Ain't a total wreck . . . you can double check! Stickin' out your neck . . . is for giraffes!

So, if some night you want me baby . . . I'll meet you face to face, you can name the place!

I'll be in the pink . . . I'll buy the drink! After one or two . . . I'll tell you why we're through!

Absolutely through . . .  I think!
