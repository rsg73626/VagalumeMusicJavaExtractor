DANCING IN HEAVEN (ORBITAL BE-BOP)

(are you ready? here we go)
Slow-slow- quick quick slow
Slow-slow- quick quick slow

Countdown its getting to the flight time
Night stars are shining in my eyes
My shoes are going to be the first ones
To dance deep up in the skys

Dancing in heaven i never thought i could get my feet this far
(orbital be-bop)
Dancing in heaven i never thought i could get my feet this far
(orbital be-bop)
(kick it out)

Slow-slow- quick quick slow
Slow-slow- quick quick slow

I'll be the first to bassa nova
Ten thousand miles above my legs
You dear, my lady on the radar
I'll bring a child to outer space

Dancing in heaven i never thought i could get my feet this far
(orbital be-bop)
Dancing in heaven i never thought i could get my feet this far
(orbital be-bop)

Hey, here i am
I hear the universe sing
The celestial scream
I am not alone
Are you receiving me clear
There is others out here

Dancing in heaven i never thought i could get my feet this far
(orbital be-bop)
