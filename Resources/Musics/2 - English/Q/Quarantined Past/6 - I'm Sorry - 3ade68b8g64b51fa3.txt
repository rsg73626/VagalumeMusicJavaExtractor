I'M SORRY

you just don't understand
where i've been coming from
i wish to not be scared
when i try to clean myself up
you just don't understand
where i've been coming from
i've tried this all before
and i've failed every time

i've died and you've
caught me
my sleeve
and we've
tried to laugh
under those circumstances

and you're good to me and
i push you away and
everyone thinks
i.m crazy
maybe they've got that all right

you just don't understand
where i've been coming from
i wish to not be scared
when i try to clean myself up
you just don't understand
where i've been coming from
i've tried this all before
and i've failed every time
