OVERDOSE

We met a man named henry on the corner
Shouting political slurs
We decided he had to come with us
Took off his stilts and threw them in the trunk

He showed us around town
Told us of how his mother gave birth to him
By the fountain in the center of town
And the homeless overheard and told us a story
This one mans girlfriend overdosed on some psychiatric pills
She was really into jim morisson

All i could offer was my cigarette
And away to the corner of his universe he went
