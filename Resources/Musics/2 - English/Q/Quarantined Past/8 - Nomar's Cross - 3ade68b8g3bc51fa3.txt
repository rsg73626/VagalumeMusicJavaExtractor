NOMAR'S CROSS

it's true you're someone else
and i've stayed here
basically by myself

the lies that you told me
have helped too
stay here by myself

get out your cross and pray 
today is the day
throw ashes on your face
say that it's heaven sent
really it is just burnt toast
it's true you've been hurting the most
