GROUND ZERO SUICIDE

little boy with the headphones too big
trying to silence all in his head

little girl with flowers in her hands
placing them all where he shot himself

and she said,
"my mother is dead
and my father is dying.
for what it's worth,
know i'm not lying."

and she said,
"my mother is dead
and my father is dying.
for what it's worth,
no, i'm not lying."
