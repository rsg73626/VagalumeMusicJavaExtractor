SPOKE

don't take my words to heart
they don't make sense to me
everyday i know you less
and i think you should leave
but i'd hate to see you go
though you've already left
a backpack full of explosives underneath your check

i will fake my way around this guitar
with this one sided track
selling art to aspiring
runaways on
side highways and streets
