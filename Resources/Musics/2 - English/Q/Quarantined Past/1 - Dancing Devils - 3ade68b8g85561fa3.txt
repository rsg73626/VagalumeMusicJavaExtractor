DANCING DEVILS

missed with my needle stab 
not much good after the cash is gone. 
mezmerize by my intentions

closet freak shining on the scene
take some time to reconnect 
establish your minds third eye

new perspective brass and steel 
molded into what could have been

I am here with my flaws again

there they are projected on your wall
Speak a hymn of hushing rhyme 
let the dancing devils on my left right in. 

Sink me, slower just enough
to feel the water cool my skin

Ask me harsher why I have my hands 
I only use them to destroy what my mother gave me
Ask me harder why I have my heart 
i don.t know, i only use it to fool myself.
