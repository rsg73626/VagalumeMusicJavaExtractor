EVE

i thought i heard my mother say
"this seems like a dream"

but i realized that the waves had come over
too soon to sooth

wake up take off your makeup
lets see inside whats broken
never said that i was a doctor
but shit i'll give it a shot

those drugs no longer work for ya
but i know that i've got a car
give me some cash i'll pump my own gas
we can shimmy over to california
