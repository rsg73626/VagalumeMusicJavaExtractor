LONG WARF WALTZ

Jimi Hendrix played his guitar in the background of my
car
as it poured and you just held his hand
i held my breath and couldn't wait for this to end

i wrote long warf in pen
to remember where we last met
it was raining and you weren't alone
neither was i but it seemed tremendously cold
i've always hated to see you go

you hadn't yet figured when and not to run
these problems they mount and will collapse if
provoked
wish i had all the answers already figured out
i know my opinion doesn't really matter much
though i will always think of you as my saving one

the present you gave me was a dirty reminder of how
things fell
drugs will rearange thinking patterns and kill your
sense of humor
which i always loved

jimmi hendrix played his guitar in the background of
my car
as it poured and you just held his hand
i held my breath and couldn't wait for this to end.
