SCHCHTERN

Take a step to the left - and one to the right
And now turn round - do it on the other side

left hand on your hip - the right behind the neck
now hop around the room - always be glad

show us your teeth - and bang the head
your tongue until the nose - absolutely mad


Ref.:
Hey Everybody - c'mon dance with us
Do it now and do it fast !!!
This is definitely your last chance-
do the q-fish dance!!!!


2ndNow shake your bones - the legs to the ear
shout the Q-Fish out - everybody wants to hear

Hoppin' round and round - with the tip of the toe
pull your finger out - until the end of the show

This is the happiest dance - you've ever heard
feel funny and amazed - we'll gonna paint the town red


Ref.:
Hey Everybody - c'mon dance with us
Do it now and do it fast !!!
This is definitely your last chance-
do the q-fish dance!!!!

Solo

Ref.:(bis zum Abwinken)
Hey Everybody - c'mon dance with us
Do it now and do it fast !!!
This is definitely your last chance-
do the q-fish dance!!!!
