THE TRUST

They say: In god we trust
believe him and you're allright
you told me that you need - much more time
to trust in me - but you'll never do
something has happened with u in the past
was it my fault? If not what's wrong ?

Trust in me,
c'mon honey trust in me
don't put your head in the sand - so fast
trust is everything - so don't give up -
and trust !

I'm not the bad man who has hurt you
don't transfer the past in me
you shouldn't end something before it has begun
but you did - you're cowardly !
every time the phone rings - I hope it's you
I can't stand it anymore - let the bell sing !

Trust in me,
c'mon honey trust in me
don't put your head in the sand - so fast
trust is everything - so don't give up -
and trust !

At the end of the game I'm standing here -
with the incredible nothing in my hands!
Was it my fault ?
If not - tell my what was wrong ?
If not - tell me why you were gone ?
so what about staying with me?
so what about trusting in me?
So what about believing in me?

Trust in me,
c'mon honey trust in me
don't put your head in the sand - so fast
trust is everything - so don't give up -
and trust !

Trust in me,
c'mon honey trust in me
don't put your head in the sand - so fast
trust is everything - so don't give up -
and trust !
