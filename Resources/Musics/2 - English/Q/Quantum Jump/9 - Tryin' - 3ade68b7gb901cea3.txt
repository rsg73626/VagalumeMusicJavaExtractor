TRYIN'

totally timeless 
our love seemed to be
something universal something in lifes keep 
springing from within the heart
but knowing it takes time

but I cant have a feeling 
that is only me whos walking a mile
feels like Ive been tryin and tryin and tryin for quite a while
but I cant have a feeling that is only me whos walking a mile

I still remember
the days we used to bring
then when we were together
in a way that would beat everything
I know you never promised
that things would stay in this way even a while

and now stuck with a feeling that is only me whos walking a mile
feels like Ive been tryin and tryin and tryin for quite a while
but I cant have feelings that is only me whos walking a mile

feels like Ive been tryin and tryin and tryin for quite a while
but I cant have a feeling that is only me whos walking a mile

baby, baby oh baby Im walking a mile
baby, baby oh baby Im walking a mile
ohh baby
