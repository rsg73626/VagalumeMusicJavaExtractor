NO AMERICAN STARSHIP LOOKING FOR THE NEXT WORLD

Ain't no American Starship
Sent from the U.S.A. gonna help me find my way
I'm looking for the next world
And I'll find it if my aim is on time
Won't matter how hard I try
Won't affect no lie
Ain't no starship from America
Gonna take me there
Through the sky
(Looking for the next world)

Ain't no madman plotting stars
Whitecoat on his way to Mars gonna
tell me he's been too
I'm looking for the next world
Rain on my four-cornered cares
Can't fake dimension seven
On a straight highway to heaven
Ain't no starship from America
Gonna take me there
I won't find it through the sky
(Looking for the next world
