THE REAL ME

I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink.
I have to tell him about my weekend,
But he never betrays what he thinks.


Can you see the real me doctor?


I went back to my mother
I said, "I'm crazy ma, help me."
She said, "I know how it feels son,
'Cos it runs in the family."


Can you see the real me, mother?


The cracks between the paving stones
Look like rivers of flowing veins.
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane.
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house.
Yesterday she passed me by,
She doesn't want to know me now.


Can you see the real me, can you?


I went to the holy man,
Full of lies and hate,
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate.


Can you see the real me preacher?
Can you see the real me doctor?
Can you see the real me mother?
Can you see the real me me me me me me
me me me me me
