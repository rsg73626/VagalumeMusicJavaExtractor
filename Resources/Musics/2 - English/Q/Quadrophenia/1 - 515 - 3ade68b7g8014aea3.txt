515

Why should i care?
Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing

Eu-de-cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging

Prettier women.
Magically bored
On a quiet street corner
Free frustration
In our minds and our toes
Quiet stormwater

My generation
Uppers and downers
Either way blood flows.
Inside outside. leave me alone.

Inside outside. nowhere is home.
Inside outside, where have i been?
Out of my brain on the five fifteen.





On a raft in the quarry

Slowly sinking.

On the back of a lorry

Holy hitching.

Dreadfully sorry

Apple scrumping.

Born in the war

Birthday punching.





He man drag

In the glittering ballroom

Greyly outrageous

In my high heel shoes

Tightly undone

They know what they're showing

Sadly ecstatic

That their heros are news.





Why should i care?
