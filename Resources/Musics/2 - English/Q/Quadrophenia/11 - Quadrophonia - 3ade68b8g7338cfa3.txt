QUADROPHONIA

Uh
All systems activated

Uh
Yeah

Activate
Uh
Drop it
Quadrophonia, a new style
Straight from the mind into a Cubase file
Robotic movements in your brain
Your mind is blinded, feel the pain
Of a boilin' vein, you scream out loud
I spray this thunder upon the crowd
Stupid def with a lyrical mania
This is Quadrophonia

Quadrophonia
Yeah
Uh
Yeah
Uh
Drop it

Quadrophonia, unidentified
Like a UFO on the go
A force from deep down is takin' over command
Like dust computerized sand
Dont hide it, its all over you
So let me in and what you wanna do
Pay attention, ban amnesia
The Q, the U, the A-drophonia

Uh
Yeah

Yeah

Uh
Yeah
Uh

Disactivate quadrophonia
