HEY QT

Hey Qt, yeah?
Yeah, there's something I want to say
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me
Hey Qt, yeah?
Even though you're so far away
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me, boy

So I've been thinking about you quite a lot
It's not that I don't
I just really want to take you with
Everywhere I go
Yesterday, I was out driving around
The night was so black
And the lights were so blinding
Suddenly I saw a flash in the sky
I felt your warmth and I knew you were [?]
Baby

Hey Qt, yeah?
Yeah, there's something I want to say
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me
Hey Qt, yeah?
Even though you're so far away
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me, boy


Hey, so there's something else I want to say
I've got this new song
And it's the only one I want to play
Makes me want to dance
Last weekend, I was out at this new place
Dancing with friends but the music was so sad
Suddenly, everyone started to jump
Played your new song it's like nothing I've heard before
Baby

Hey Qt, yeah?
Yeah, there's something I want to say
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me
Hey Qt, yeah?
Even though you're so far away
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me, boy
