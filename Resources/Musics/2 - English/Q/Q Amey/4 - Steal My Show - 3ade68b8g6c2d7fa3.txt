STEAL MY SHOW

[Verse 1:]
We about to start the show
And I ain't heard from you I know
You gotta be somewhere running to the mall
Just feel it in my bones
It's hard to believe that you're at home
Girl, pick up the phone
I've been callin' all day long
I know you got my message tried to send it bout a thousand times (all in one breath!)
Then I got the busy line
I don't know what is the problem
I thought we solved them
Tell me is it still him

[Chorus:]
How could somebody else steal my show
How could somebody else win my gold
How would somebody else feel to know
You love somebody else, you got somebody else

How could somebody else steal my show
How could somebody else win my gold
I know that you don't want me to know
You got somebody else, I know you with somebody else

[Verse 2:]
I'm about to sing ya song
The one where it says you and me suppose to be together girl (all in one breath!)
So hurry up c'mon
Cause baby I'm starving tryin' figure out if you coming
I need to know something
I'm thinking that it's over girl
Cause we ain't never went a day without each other
There has to be another brother
I think I know what's going on
But girl I'm still wonderin'...

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I don't think you get it girl
I don't think you realize what's going on
Ain't never missed no one like this I'm all alone
I wish I known you would go
And do something like this
Somebody help me sing my song

I don't think you get it girl
I don't think you realize what's going on
Ain't never missed no one like this I'm all alone
I wish I known...
Baby I thought we were perfect
But you were never worth my loveeeeeee
