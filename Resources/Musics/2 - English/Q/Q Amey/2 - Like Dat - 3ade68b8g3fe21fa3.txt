Yes sirr

Shorty so seductive
So relinin
Tryin to play it super smooth
She don't know who the pimp is
Stop starin in my eyes
I got time for acres
Have ya hittin more bed
Feel this hole in ya mattress
I need a five foot dime
Who kno she classy
No doubt about her mouth
Cause she kno she sexy
A freak whose in need
For sure she naked
Man a chick like that
I can't let her walk past me
Understand a dog
When she see me grindin
Who can play my backbone
When she hear my rhymin
Imma shy baby
Shorty think i'm lyin
You can ask ray charles
You can see me shining
When my clique post'ed up
We got a gangsta scene
We got bad body shorty
Doin gangsta thing
Fuck a b-boy stand
I got a gangsta lean
Just ta show these otha suckas
What a gangsta means
