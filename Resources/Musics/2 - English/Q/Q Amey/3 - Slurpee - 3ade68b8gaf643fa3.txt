To tell me that its cool cause she like it like that
Know just what to do she can throw it right back
Gotta an attitude ain't gotta show her how to act
And if i find a shawty of her status
Name anything she want it be there before she have it
I'm searchin for the truth (ha)
So baby tell me is it you
Because i gotta know

She gotta have thick hips wit a means like whoa
ain't afraid to go into the strip alone
I need a girl to hold me down shawty
Anyway your thinking how
She need to be on top game wit a swagger
Up north or down south it don't matter

Can you give me what i need

Shawty if you want to get it you can meet me on the
floor
Cause the way them jeans fit make me wanna go

You can call ya boy picky but i know what i need
A ride or die misses who would do anything for me

She gotta have thick hips wit a means like whoa
