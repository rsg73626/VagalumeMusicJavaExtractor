ALWAYS

Chalk on the board and lyrics in my head

Guitar chords from The Grateful Dead
Closing my eyes and seeing the stage
Letting go of all my rage
Singing into the microphone
And suddenly I?m not feeling alone

Singing my heart out Keeping the beat
Humming the melody Tapping my feet
Emotions bursting I?m outta my seat
Mind of fast-forward, Words on repeat

Papers to be filed are still on my desk
I?m looking so organized my head?s a mess
The words I hear in my head just won?t fade away
They steal my concentration for the third time today
And I let go of reality and I?m playing with my band
Shaking the stadium and rocking the stand

Singing my heart out Keeping the beat
Humming the melody Tapping my feet
Emotions bursting I?m outta my seat
Mind of fast-forward, Words on repeat

Sarah?s tugging at my feet "Mommy I?m so bored!"
But I don?t hear her voice because I?m playing a new chord
Lips pursed, eyes shut tight, volume turned on low
Mentally singing the lyrics from 6 years ago
And snapping back to my little girl I can?t believe I lost my dreams
Life never stopped for my music or at all is how it all seems

Singing my heart out Keeping the beat
Humming the melody Tapping my feet
Emotions bursting I?m outta my seat
Mind of fast-forward, Words on repeat

Paying the last of the bills on Tony?s student loans
But keeping the rhythm of the Rolling Stones
I can?t believe I?ve gotten so old and I never got to sing
Never got to sit up stage and play on my six-string
But I guess I lived through the music in my head
And long live music until well after I?m dead

Singing my heart out Keeping the beat
Humming the melody Tapping my feet
Emotions bursting I?m outta my seat
Mind of fast-forward, Words on repeat

Singing my heart out Keeping the beat
Humming the melody Tapping my feet
Emotions bursting I?m outta my seat
Mind of fast-forward, Words on repeat

Oh yeah, words always on repeat
Words always on repeat
