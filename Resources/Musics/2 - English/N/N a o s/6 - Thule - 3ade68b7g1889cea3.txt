THULE

Thule Is Similar To Magonia. A Mythical Place of 
Balance, Tranquility, Life And Power. Thule Is 
Inherited In our Blood. Our Bloodline Is Traced In 
The Blood of gods And Kings. It Is our Royal Right To 
Re-Discover Thule And Make It Again The Center of 
The Cosmos. Tha Capital of The World In Art, 
Philosophy, Science, Technology, Economy, And 
Magic. As Rightful Rulers of This World We Must 
Re-Claim our Throne. Our Blood Commands It....
