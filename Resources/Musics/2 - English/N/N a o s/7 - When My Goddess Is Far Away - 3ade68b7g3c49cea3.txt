WHEN MY GODDESS IS FAR AWAY

My Terrible Feeling of Emptiness Overcomes Me When 
My Soulmate Is Far Away. When My Other Half Is 
Away, Half of Myself Is With Her. I Feel Crippled And 
Incomplete. This Instrumental Part Is A Little Bit Old 
But The Cold Feeling of Absence Will Embrace Me Once 
Again Very Soon. It Is The Best Epilogue For 
"Communion" And For N.A.O.S. Too. 
Farewell..........
