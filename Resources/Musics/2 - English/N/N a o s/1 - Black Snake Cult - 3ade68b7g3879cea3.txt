The Serpent. The Ancient Symbol of 
Wisdon And Eternity. The Dragon. The 
Primordial Source. Source of All Things. 
Have You Ever Consider Why Man 
Connects The Serpent With Evil? Have 
You Found An Answer? No. Maybe 
Because Serpents Crawl. But Crawling 
Brings Them Closer To Earth Don't You 
Think? Actually People Are Right. The 
Serpent Is Evil. It's Evil Because It 
Represents Knowledge And Wisdom. 
What Is More Threatening And 
Dangerous Than Knowledge? Nothing. 
Knowledge Gives You Power And Wisdom 
Gives You The Right To Use It. So I Will 
Drink To That! A Toast For The Great 
Serpent! The Creature of gods.
