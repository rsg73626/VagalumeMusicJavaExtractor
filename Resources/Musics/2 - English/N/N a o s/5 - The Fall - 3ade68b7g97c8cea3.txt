THE FALL

The Greatest Fiasco of All Times Was The 
Fall of Lucifer. I Am Sure That When 
Lucifer Rebelled Against Jehova, Hell 
Was Not Exactly What He Had In Mind. 
Unforunately Lucifer Became An Alibi 
For Jehova. For Every sin, Misfortune, 
Desire, You Name It Lucifer Was To 
Blame. So Instead of Liberation Lucifer's 
Gift To Mankind Was Enslavement. I 
Know That It Is Not His Fault. Mr god Is Too 
Coward To Take Responsibility For His Own 
Actions So He Uses Lucifer As A Scapegoat. 
What Can Lucifer Do? He Needs Your 
Support. Stop Believing The Lies of Mr 
god And Give The Devil His Due. Take 
Responsibility For Your Own Actions And 
Do Not Blame It On Satan. Satan Does Not 
Give A Damn About You. His First Priority 
Is Mr god. Lucifer Needs You. Keep In 
Mind That The Fall Was Done For You....
