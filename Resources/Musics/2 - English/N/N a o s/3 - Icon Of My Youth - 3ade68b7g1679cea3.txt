ICON OF MY YOUTH

I've Seen My Life Collapsing Into Thousand Pieces of 
Glass. Like A Broken Mirror. My Soul Was Split In A 
Thousand Small Parts. The Icon of My Youth Was 
Destroyed. The False Icon of My Youth Was Torn To 
Pieces. And I Saw Myself As It Really Is. With All It's 
Weaknesses, With All It's Qualities. In The Beginning 
I Did Not Like What I Saw, But Afterwards I Realized 
That It Was Me. And I Decided To Imrpove Me. To 
Have A New Icon of Myself. Equally Powerful But 
This Time For Real. Take A Look In The Mirror. Maybe 
Your Icon Needs Re-Evaluation Too...
