BURNING

This Is About Murder. About Violence, Bloodshed, 
Revenge. About The People That I Really Hate. People 
Who Are Crawling Around My Feet Drooling. 
Disgusting Subhumans Who Need A Bullet In The Head. 
Or Is It Too Merciful? Yeah I Guess It Is. Torments 
Of Excrutiating Pain Would Be More Appropriate. 
But Truly I Love My Enemies. The Love Me Too. 
They Need Me. I Give A Meaning To Their Miserable 
Lives. So This Song Is Dedicated To You My Dearest 
Enemies : May I Taste Your Hate Forever!
