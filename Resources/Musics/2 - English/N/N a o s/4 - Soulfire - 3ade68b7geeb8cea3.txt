SOULFIRE

Dreams Visit Me Oftenly. Small Visions 
Of Truth And Plain Whirling Around My 
Cosmos, Waiting For Me To Sleep. Little 
Demons Emerge From Every Part of My 
Body, Every Inch of My Soul. To Posses 
Me. Every Desire/Thought Transforms 
Into Something Menacing, Threatening 
And Real. The Female Part of The Psyche 
Awakens And Seeks Revenge. There Is No 
Defense In Sleep. We Are Vulnerable Like 
Children. This Is The Reason Why 
"Soulfire" Is Performed By A Woman. 
The Most Merciless, Powerful, Cunning 
Creature on Earth. Like Nature Itself.........
