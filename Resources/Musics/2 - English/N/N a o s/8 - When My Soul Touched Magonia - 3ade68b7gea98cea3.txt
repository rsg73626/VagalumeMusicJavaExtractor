WHEN MY SOUL TOUCHED MAGONIA

There are times that you feel the cold
Embrace of sorrow deep into your soul.
Disappointment overcomes you. you
Realize that you hurt and betrayed the
People who love and care about.
Your breath. suddenly behind your
Eyes a new world is comming to life:
Magonia. a place where pain is no
More. where sorrow is absent. the
Realm of myth. elves, gods, godesses,
Demons, orcs, trolls, legendary beasts,
Everyone is there. living in perfect
Harmony and balance. there you can
Heal your wounds and have your
Willpower back. there is a small
Emergency exit in your subconscious.
Look for it.......
