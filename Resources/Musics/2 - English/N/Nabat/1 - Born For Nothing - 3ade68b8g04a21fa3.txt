BORN FOR NOTHING

Here we are again the calvary
starts again
You slam the door at they scream 
at your face
You drag yourself with a bitter taste 
in your mouth
You feel a lump in your throat
Look around you
You are alone in this city
Every day your same ritual
But you have decided to look
You feel the rope running through 
slip -knot
You don't want understand
In this dullness that comes with you
A woman's face is too important
Maybe we were born for nothing
But you have decided to ask no question
