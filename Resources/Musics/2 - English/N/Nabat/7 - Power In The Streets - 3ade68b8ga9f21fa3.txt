POWER IN THE STREETS

Go! 
Trust only yourself 
and never confide in anybody t
hey are organized 
you' ll have to defend yourself 
Fight to live Power in the streets 
and if you ain't got a place 
it's only your fucked business 
we don't need charity that screw your arse

[Chorus:]
In this fucking city we can't fun 
there are no alternative, only Tv rules 

[Chorus]
