DONT WANNA LIVE WITHOUT YOU 2S

She turns to me so softly 
she says she understands 
what's driving me insane 
the nights we spent together 
were more than just a game 
but now nothing is like it used to be 
so i say 

Don't wanna live without you 
I never meant it to be that way 
Don't wanna live without you 
why don't you give it a try now 


We've been parted much too long 
it's time to spread or wings and fly 
broken hearted we're standing on the river line 
of a love gone by 

Don't wanna live without you 
I never meant it to be that way 
Don't wanna live without you 
why don't you give it a try now 

didn't mean to rob your heart 
I just wished that we could have a start 
to live our life the way it's meant to be 
didn't me to do you harm 
it's just that I can't resist your charms 
the promise that you keep is too inviting
