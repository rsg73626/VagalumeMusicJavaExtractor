SOULMAN

call me a hero 
call me a thief 
call me the names that you think do fit to me 
don't care if you're acting unfair as long as your images of me give you reason to be there 
you want to know how it feels to be like me 
you want to understand why 
the truth is never ever big enough so here come another lie 

I'm a soulman and I don't wanna know why 
I'm a lonley sailor sailing the sky 
just like a preacher who lost his belief 
I am a love addicted looking for relief 

there ain't a place that I do belong to 
somehow everything that I do turns out to be wrong 
sometimes it just seems like I am a nowhere man in his little tiny nowhere land 
so I close my eyes and let my thoughts get up high 
while thousands of angles call my name 
well am I just dreaming or am I driving insane 

I'm a soulman... 

we never think of the darkness while we face the light 
we don't believe in destiny when everything works out right 
but somehow we have to face somewhere 
that life isn't funny and love isn't fair 

I'm a soulman...
