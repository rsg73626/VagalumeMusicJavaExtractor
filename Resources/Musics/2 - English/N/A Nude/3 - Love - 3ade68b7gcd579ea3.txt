LOVE

love's got its meaning 
love's got its time 
love is uncertain 
sometimes love is hard to find 
but I swear I will allways be true 
and I hope you do forgive my acting like a fool 
this is love 
this is what love is all about 
this is love 
it helps you up and it turns you around 

love can be healing 
love can be care 
love can be pleading 
after all love is to share 
why do we act like strangers 
why do we sometimes tell us lies 
why do we feel unable to see the truth before our eyes 
thies is love... 

love is harder than steal 
is's purer than gold 
it's only a feeeling 
love it's got to be true 
it's got to be real 
my loving is you 

love can be healing 
love can be care 
love can be pleading 
after all love is to share 

this is love...
