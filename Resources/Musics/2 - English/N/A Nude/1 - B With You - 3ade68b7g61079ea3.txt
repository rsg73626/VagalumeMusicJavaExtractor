B WITH YOU

It's crazy but it's true 
I only wanna be with you... 
I`d like to thank you for the joy you brought into my life 
I`d like to ask you if you could join me for a while 
and if you do I`ll finally make your wish come true 
built you a castle made of confess 
and chase away your bitterness 
It`s crazy but it`s true 
I only wanna be with you 
I`d like to remind you of what we swore someday 
no matter how far apart we would find a way 
don`t you forget about me cause everything has changed 
don`t you regret our being in too deep cause your life`s new arranged 
It`s crazy...
