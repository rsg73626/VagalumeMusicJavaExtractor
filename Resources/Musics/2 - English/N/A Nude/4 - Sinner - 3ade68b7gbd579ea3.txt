SINNER

how do you feel when you wake up at night 
and your head is filled up with desire 
why do you scream when your loosing control 
in the ened nobody wants to know 
you act like a beast of burden like a thief in the night 
you keep on running around 
why don't we get straight to the point now 
all you want from me is to hear that 

I'm a sinner 
I'm a saint 
I'm a liar 
but I'm not ashamed 

this is getting serious it's more than I can take 
your behaviour is far too strange 
the way you walk the way you talk 
is much too cool these days 
what's on your mind when you're tryin to be kind 
by treating me like a fool 
there's no sense in believing 
that the way you are living is extraordinary 
let me tell you 

I'm a sinner... 

so you want me to live this way for a lifetime 
so you want me to give you everything- oh lord I've tryed 
what about the friends we care for- can we look them straight in the eyes 
what about the world we live i- can we give it a try 

I'm a sinner....
