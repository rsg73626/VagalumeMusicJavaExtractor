FRUSTRATION

Run without competition because I know I'm gonna lose
My hands and feets are tied up by chains of fear and frustration

Faking happiness to the world
Diving in my own grave

Keep running from the light, too afraid of what I may find
No matter how I try I never get things right

Faking happiness to the world
Diving in my own grave
Losing pieces of my soul

I cannot be saved
