THE LIVING CORPSE

Rotten to the core
Can't take it anymore
Can't you feel the pain
The price of being insane

Barely living
Barely breathing
Slow heart beating
Almost dead

Poison through my veins
I think I'm going blind
I'll never do this again
Don't turn out the light

The living corpse
The living dead
It's not fun anymore
Fear of death inside my head

The living corpse
The walking dead
Pain and Paranoia
I'm nothing but a living dead

The Living Corpse - The Living Dead
