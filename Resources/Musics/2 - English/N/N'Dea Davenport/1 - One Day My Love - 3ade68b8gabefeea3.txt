ONE DAY MY LOVE

i hope the hurricane blows over
the winds keep shifting every day
weve learned to run & duck for cover
this wind keeps blowin us away
but one day now

one day now

one day my love x5

we run both lookin for some shelter
with who there was a price to pay

but when in our way helter skelter
we went threw it all the way

but one day 
one day now

one day now

but one day 
one day now

one day my love x15

yea 
one day my love (repeat till end)
