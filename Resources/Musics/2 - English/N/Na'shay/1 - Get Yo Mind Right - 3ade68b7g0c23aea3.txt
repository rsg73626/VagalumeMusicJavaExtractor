GET YO MIND RIGHT

Boy even when you swing
I'm not gonna hate cuz
I'm gonna be okay
I take it as a loss
Brush and shake it off
There to fight another day
Stop acting like a fool
Trying to play it cool
Like there ain't no worries
Better change your attitude
I'll find another dude

Better hurry (get yo mind right)
Is she the one that you want?
Is she the one that you need?
Boy what you want it to be?

Get yo mind right
Either you is or you ain't
Either you can or can't
Boy your still stuck on the playing

Get yo mind right
Am i the one that you want?
Am i the one that you need?
Boy what you want it to be?

Get yo mind right
Either you do or you don't
Either you will or you won't
You'll find yourself all alone
Oh oh oh
