HURRY FEAT. LIL BROTHA

Hurry hurry baby baby
Time's runnin out 
You need to holla holla
This chance may never come again
Really really feelin feelin
All i'm sayin is boy you gotta holla holla
This chance may never come again

There you are
I saw you when you rolled up in ya fancy car
Now you're standin holdin up the wall
Lookin like you don't know how to talk to me
Fa sho you're fine
And I know exactly what's on my mind
You're cool but you're just wastin time
Before you know you'll look up and i'll be gone

Hurry hurry baby time's runnin out for you and me
Holla holla don't miss out on this opportunity
That may never come around again (you know i'm feelin)
Really really feelin the vibes that you sendin to me
Don't be sleepin on this golden opportunity
That may never come around again

What is wrong 
Fooled around let em play my favorite song
Didn't even try to take me on
If you didn't look so good i'd bounce right now
So maybe i'll step to you
I guess it's possible for guys to be shy to
That is not my style 
Come on we both been starin for a while 

Hurry hurry baby time's runnin out for you and me
Holla holla don't miss out on this opportunity
That may never come around again (you know i'm feelin)
Really really feelin the vibes that you sendin to me
Don't be sleepin on this golden opportunity
That may never come around again

[Lil Brotha]
Look girl there ain't no reason for you to be rushin this
Just watchin your luscious lips I can't even think about other chicks
I know you're waitin but baby be patient the moment is comin closer
Stomach dropped like a roller coaster 
Thinkin of the different ways to approach ya
I mean you're the finest thing I've ever seen
Gotta put you on my team 
Getcha the Louis Vuitton the Gucci and even the bling
Now we finally on the same page I'm thinkin it's time to push play
Let's take a little trip to the bay Lil Brotha, 4Deep and Na'Shay

Hurry hurry baby baby 
Time's runnin out you need to holla holla
This chance may never come around again
Really really feelin feelin 
All i'm sayin is boy you gotta holla holla
This chance may never come around again
Hurry hurry baby

Hurry hurry baby time's runnin out for you and me
