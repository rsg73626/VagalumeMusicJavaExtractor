WE NOT ME

Mmm, mmmm, mmmm (3x)
Come to me baby

[Verse 1]
I never thought i would find somebody like you
i never thought i would find somebody to be true
i never thought someone could be this good to me
(someone) who knows my every need
i never thought that i would find love
someone who was sent from above (yeeeaaahh)
(that's why i'm tellin you right now)
that i'm filled up with love
and i will never mess around

[Chorus]
Just to say i'm weak
i'm so weak
i like the way that's soundin
boy i'm down with your lovin
just to say we not me
you make me feel so sweet
your sound, your smile i'm sooo weak
just to say i'm weak
