SINGLES ANTHEM

If she say I want you, say let's go
If she say I don't want, say gotta go
If she say that you rude, say I don't care
She's not the only one, so call the next

Boy you crazy?
What you doing man?
Stuck your mind in this girl
Just wanna know till when
She don't care about you
She's not for you
She likes those niggas that's sucks for you
So what you gonna do
Stop acting like a fool
You are the player, I'm the coach
I show you how to do
When N-Dre it's in the game, pay attention to man
This is the singles Anthem

It's not for hate, its to earn hatters
(so do me a favor)
Get another one, another one and another one
All those girls want to get fucked up
So get one and call to fuck
She's a bad bitch, she don't want love
All she wants is to scream and have some fun
She may want another drink
A shot of patron to make on the beach

If she say I want you, say let's go
If she say I don't want, say gotta go
If she say that you rude, say I don't care
She's not the only one, so call the next

Girl, you are so amazing
You could be my lady
I will try you later
But now I got show you
You loosing time with the wrong guy
Every time I ask myself why
When you put that dress
The way you shake that ass
Everybody goes crazy like they hallucinating
If you seek for me, lets call a stork to make a trick

You deserve more than you used to have
Run the world cause you are he fucking best
All these boys when with you they act like a kid
That's why they never been a real man
Stop! look what I've said
N-Dre it's here to make you sweat
Take off this clothes right now
We got all night to scream so loud
