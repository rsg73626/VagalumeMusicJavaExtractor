WHILE YOU SLEEP

While you sleep
I'm making dollars
Hit the club with my niggas, just popping bottles
Where the girls at, I'm coming in
Tell shawty I have what she needs
Full of bottles, full of cash, in a daze, don't care about rest
Look to my style nigga, I'm so fresh
Full of bottles, full of cash, in a daze, don't care about rest
Look to my style nigga, I'm so fresh

Step in the club
Stop the scene
Boys getting mad
Bitches looking at me
This feeling so good
They all want to be me
Cause I make look easy, but it isn't

Call me freshman, look my swag
Go home boy, better you take a bath
For you this club it's like a game
I'm the final boss and you have no chance

If you looking for the bottles, come here (come here)
If you looking for love, get out here (get out of here)
If you want to get high, call us (call us)

Red cups, dark shades
Good student, high grades
Girl, you are so hot, you should burn with me
Now I'm feeling so fly like a g6
Yeah, it's just like that
I made this party and you call your friends
Calm down, I won't let you alone
I just never forget about my homies
