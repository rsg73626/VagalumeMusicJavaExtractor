HIGH DREAMS

Light it up, if you want to
if you don't, you should try to
Girl, I light it up and I take it to the head
I think bout my life, I think bout how we met
Looks like a dream, you were alone, started a conversation
conversation rolled up and we already done
the talk caught fire, we burn together
then you started to sweat, your legs were lighter as a feather
you said that you cannot fall in love with me
we live far away and now you already missing me
and I told you to don't worry, you gotta stay calm
and take this as a high dreams


I like to sit down and have these high dreams
Make me feel good and turn up for another move

I feel so good
(I feel so good)
I'm up and away
(I'm up and away)
If you want to get high
(If you want to get high)
gotta find my way
(gotta find my way)
Love it's in the air, we can smell that
Your senses will guide you, you gonna love it
my #1mixtape sounds like a Pro
I'm the next joint, niggas ain't even a roach
I look good but I rap better
my veggies strong and my girls fashion
I turn up and get faded
(faded)
I watch movies and play games
(games)
I roll around the city
(santos)
I have my homies here with me
I look stoned but I even
hit up to believe me
look at your feet
cause just can't feel it
I want to do it big you gotta do something
dont give work hard all you doing is nothing
the top it's too high
just like me
do the same and reach your high dreams


I like to sit down and have these high dreams
Make me feel good and turn up for another move
