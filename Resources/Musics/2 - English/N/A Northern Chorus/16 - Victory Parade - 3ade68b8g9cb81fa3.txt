VICTORY PARADE

Turn on the pillars of light,
And film some lovers embracing.
Raise a flag to the sky,
To show the world that it’s sacred.

But hold off on the victory parade,
Reverse engineer the entire thing.
As it’s bound to create insurgency,
And that could jeopardize everything.

Just start passing out the blindfolds,
Tear up and barricade these inroads.
Cuz I have got this under control.

I want microphones put in their homes, 
Cuz they’re fixin’ to overthrow.
Keep their eyes on the prize,
On the noise and the white lights,
Just keep them occupied,
Just keep them occupied.

But hold off on the victory parade,
(call off the marching band, send all the dancers back home)
Reverse engineer the entire thing.
(tear up these inroads, and pass out the blindfolds)
As it’s bound to create insurgency,
(ready the crowd control, they’ll keep this riot at bay)
And that could jeopardize everything
