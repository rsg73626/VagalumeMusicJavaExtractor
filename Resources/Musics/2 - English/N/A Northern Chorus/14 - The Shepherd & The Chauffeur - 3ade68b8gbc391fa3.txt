THE SHEPHERD & THE CHAUFFEUR

You've been talkin' in tongues for years now haven't ya. 
Encoding the view into your body of work. 
The story goes - that somewhere across the prairie spine you severed all ties to the crime, and drove on for miles. 
With a seaward gaze, and empathic eyes, you seduced the sirens with money and lies for an alibi. 
You'd always said you'd never let yourself become an accessory to mediocrity. 
"Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt. I'm here for the shepherd and the chauffeur." 
You'd always said, you'd never let yourself become an accessory to mediocrity
