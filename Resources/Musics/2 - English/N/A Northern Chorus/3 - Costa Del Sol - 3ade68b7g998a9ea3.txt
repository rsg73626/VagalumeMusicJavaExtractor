COSTA DEL SOL

Please direct your eyes 
To the trembling skies
To the trembling skies

And catch every glimpse in all your
Words and all your conjured chords
As sure as bitter hands resign
The past will be seen in new light
Cast upon old words that you thought you'd lost in the fire
And in this flood these old roads don't stand a chance 
So breathe it in 
And bask in the raging water

Don't,
Don't let hindsight drive you mad 
Sure enough it can
Just hold the past up in clear view
And catch every glimpse at once
