AND STILL SHE SLEEPS

All I wanted was this day relived, for its led me astray
And im so tired of roaming around 
in this dream as that fire burns away

And still she is sleeping
she's holding this dream in her arms
and still there is no only peace 
like the one that i find in her eyes

All I wanted was this day relived, for its led me astray
And im so tired of roaming around
in this dream as that fire burns away
