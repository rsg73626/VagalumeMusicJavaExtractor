THE MILLIONS TOO MANY

These few weeks of rowing around these lakes 
Have moved faster than the breaks in between the smoke and the recoil routines 
But the harvest is on the minds of 
Lone farmers and the millions too many 

Open up the flues and let the ashes escape 
They've been breathing in smoke for too long and some have fallen asleep 
And forever is a lifetime, 
The pulse stays static and everyones got some found addiction to depend on 

We'll throw on our costumes and realign 
The chemical structure that keeps us in line 
Cause I've got this plan, that seeks a lot of time 
I've got this plan that seeks a lot of time 

So throw out your plans and put down your rusted hands, the day is on you 
Stop waiting to speak, you keep your allies close to hear what they might have seen 
Poor focus has blurred out the lines and the millions too many
