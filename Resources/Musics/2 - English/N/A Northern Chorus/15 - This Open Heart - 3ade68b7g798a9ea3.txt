THIS OPEN HEART

The poems strewn 
Across the floor 
They’re out of tune 
With every chord
And one reads ‘lay down 
Inside this open heart’ 

And where’s this heart of which it speaks? 
It must be soaring skies revealed
For it’s been fooled for the last time
Or so it would seem
And I can't lay down 
Inside this open heart
With these crazed eyes
Of aftermath

Tell me what happens when the planets align? 
Will torrid skies collapse our hearts? 
Will jealous moons come crashing down 
Into the ocean floor? 

For it’s been fooled for the last time
Or so it would seem
And it’s been fooled for the last time
Or so it would seem
