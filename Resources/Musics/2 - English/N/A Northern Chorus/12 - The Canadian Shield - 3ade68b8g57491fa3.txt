THE CANADIAN SHIELD

Don’t focus on the static distraction,
Or how it pulls you into its arms.
Just give me some kind of reaction,
Before it freezes both our hearts.
We’re standing behind the Canadian shield,
Basking in the half-light. 
We’ll try to conjure a peace that remains concealed,
And keep on fighting the good fight.

Then it’s all broken up by the dawn,
Splintered into majesty and torn into awe.
Awakened by the timelessness of it all,
And how the night just succumbs to universal law
