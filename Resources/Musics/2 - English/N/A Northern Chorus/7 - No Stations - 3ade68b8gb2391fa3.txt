NO STATIONS

Bearing down a train you're a wreck 
You have nothing yet 
You're mobile, just draggin' a bit 
On past the trees, the arks, and the freeze 
There's no stations left but you know that 

Book ends poured into place 
They're set in and phrased 
You've sought out an island beyond 
The freeze and the fog, solid rock, movin' on 
Through and eye of a camera you're home now 

Home now and livin' out your dreams 
I guess we both need 
Light to pass through the cracks just to be seen 
It's pouring down the walls 
The saturate we call 
Hope and heaven destination above all
