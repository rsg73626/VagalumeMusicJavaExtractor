DON'T THINK OF COLLAPSE

Embark with plight destination. 
With true words that honour the piece, and plan out your rests and peaks. 
To start, blank page annoyance. 
Depart of the obvious clues. 
The mindset has misconstrued confidence. 
A new muse is needed to help me conclude. 
You stand on the right side of us. 
You stand there, and moments of weakness pass. 
It's foriegn it's plain and collapsed. 
But fortune, fortune will bring us back. 
New progress is on us, in tune and with harmony too. 
The skins soaked, inked in new fashion. 
A new muse is needed to help me conclude. 
You stand on the right side of us. 
You stand there, and moments of weakness pass. 
It's foriegn to think of collapse. 
Now on course, we'll drown out our cries with lullabyes
