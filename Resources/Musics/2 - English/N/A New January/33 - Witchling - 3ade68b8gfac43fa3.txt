WITCHLING

Nightfall
Power flows so pure
Nature's shifting here
Unsure of things surrounding us
Let's just have faith this time
Take my hand, you start to feel the sides

A burning world with grabbing hands
And flapping birds with melting crayons
And children's eyes without a view
They were born and bred and they died for you

Impartially we move to eat
As everything just seems to be so
Naturally I start to shake
Six more hours until the break of dawn

October moon, the patchwork shadows
The masquerading voice
Bewitching in the swirling darkness
Whores seduce the boys
Unresting in disfigured branches
The cracked bone marrow song
Feelings of anticipation
And waiting much to long
