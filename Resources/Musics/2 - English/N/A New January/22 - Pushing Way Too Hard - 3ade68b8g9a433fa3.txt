PUSHING WAY TOO HARD

Of all the things you could dream
Of all the things you could want
Constantly you're pushing way too hard

Kiss down you're beneath all the hands
Dethrone in believe pure demands
It's not domination until you submit
Couldn't care if your wrists are too tight
Complain all you want to, we're fine
It's not domination until you submit

Cold and naked suits you
My religion's silver crowned
Kingdoms in your blindness
I'd love to bring you down

Of all the things you could dream
Of all the things you could want
Constantly you're pushing way too hard

Get caught no belief misunderstand
Fight back, isolate you'll be mad
Long overdue nonsense relevance don't forget
Submit you're so far overdue
Prejudged no appeal so overused
Suck down and re-light your fresh new cigarette

Disconnect every part
Cut, slice, sever, rend
Overwrite the last note
Psychoanalyze the end
If the words don't move you
After I'm dead and gone
Dig up my hands for reuse
And pencil in your fun
