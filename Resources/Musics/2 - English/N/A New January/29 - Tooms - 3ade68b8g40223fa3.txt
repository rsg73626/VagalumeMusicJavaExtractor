TOOMS

Coffee flows in all directions and he takes what he needs
Thirty years of slumber, awakened, only craving meat
The underground conditions always made it feel so right
Necessary bleeding
Bare hands replace the need for knives

The world just won't believe truth
Or let you hibernate
And who knows why they'd need to
Their frequent interruptions
You wish they'd all just go away

Coffee stained and coated
Newspapers and leaves
Buried beneath the will to hang trophies and feed
Move among the cities
Feeding off the life
Precious when they're breathing
Bare hands replace the need for knives

All confused and locked away
Can't ignore the hunger
Minutes pass like days
Try to fake it, good behavior pays
Only when you lie
Mouths keep telling you
Hunt or investigate
Searching's worth the wait to frame

[30 years underground]
The world just won't believe truth
[Make believe they're not around]
Or let you hibernate
[Leave me lonely in the crowd]
And who knows why they'd need to
Their frequent interruptions
You wish they'd all just go away
