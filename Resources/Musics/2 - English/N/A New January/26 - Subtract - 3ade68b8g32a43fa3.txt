SUBTRACT

With those confiscating ways
And annoying games you play
You mess up everything I try
Your always right, I always lie
When you say those things to me
You make me want to leave

I rename all your mistakes
With words you want to hear
I cover lies and fears
And make it seem like new
With symbols and perfume
It just fools part of you
Long enough to prove
I subtract from you

You just tried to drop the fact
You add it up and I subtract
It was never in your thoughts
Or maybe you forgot
It was right in front of you
I'll hold my breath until I turn blue
