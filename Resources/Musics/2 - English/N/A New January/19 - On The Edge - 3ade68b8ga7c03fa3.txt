ON THE EDGE

After all I've said
And after all I've done
I stand alone
But nobody won
I laughed at you
'Cause I got out alive
And I left you
With memories and lies

I can barely see the floor
The clothes are hiding, darkened wood
Pretending that you're innocent
Haven't you always wanted this?

Whatever happened to you anyway
How did you ever get over your lies
I told you, "Go to hell"
When you said you could love me
And I almost laugh when you say goodbye
