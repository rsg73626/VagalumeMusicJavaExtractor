PHASES

You were silenced
For having psychopathic thoughts
Pretend it's not the first time
As your words come as a loss
I've seen you looking through the window
When you're talking on the phone
I know your greatest expectations
Keep you crawling back for more
You're dreaming now
For however long it takes
To wake up and go on
On into the next phase
As your life just slips away

They can feel just like
A newly salted sore
When it hurts to leave
You hold me to the floor
And night slips by
Here comes the day
You feel it
Your life just slips away

With knees shaking
As loud as laughter
You live up to your cause constantly
Dreaming of the feeling
That you had but now you've lost
I've seen you looking through the window
When you're talking on the phone
I know your greatest expectations
Keep you crawling back for more

Darkened candles light the hallways like a charm
And hear the footsteps from behind the door
You know there's nothing wrong
You've seen things in the mirror
When you're talking on your own
It seems the words are so familiar
When you've heard them for so long
