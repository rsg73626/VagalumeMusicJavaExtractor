AFTER CLOTHES

I'm loosening the tightest overcoat
Unzipping curtains just to hide the show
Cloth openings are getting wider now
Rip off the fibers that contain it all

Her nectarines rub my face
I couldn't hardly wait to taste
Sometimes we'd bury half the moon
(with only air we'd drink in)
She moves up and flutters moth-like
With broken bodies all night
We conquer everything we knew

Her aching skin longs to encompass me
Our melting flesh drips over satin sheets
Her shapes and curves are all I ever need
I bless her lips before I set her free
