SWEET ENOUGH TO STEAL

Trembling with disbelief
A drowning heart without a prayer
Uncommon eyes could tear and drip for days
Just feel the warmth and colors
From the heart
From the mind
Holding back a sleeping world is rude
Asleep and half-awake
Their dreams just melt away
Dripping through my hands
It seems to melt

The multi-colored eyes could watch
But don't look back
You'll never find
The left, the right, the even, or the odd
When it comes to numbers
When it comes to life
You hold me, sleeping or awake
I hope it's not one big mistake
That never melts away
No matter how hard you try
It never melts

Rhythmic and slightly under
Influences intoxicating
Non-stop moments fly
Her pleasure's waiting here
Impatiently, the urban landscapes groan
And painfully they cry

Her pleasure's waiting here
Sweet enough to steal
