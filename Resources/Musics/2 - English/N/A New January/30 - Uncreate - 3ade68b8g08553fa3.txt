UNCREATE

Erase the things I shouldn't say
So bothersome and in the way
Avert the stare and slide away
Consider disregard obey

My drowning seems to never change
Provide a way to rearrange
All the stupid things you fake
You tear apart and uncreate...

Pain and speed beyond your dreams
Chocolate toes and you propose
Stand around and be profound
Make it look like you know now
By the way, right away
Think of something smart to say...

Strip away the thoughts and hate
Stare and face and wash your veins
Drop and fall off-key like rain
Shivering creep out so fake

That's everything I found today...
[Went through your hiding place]
[Behind your smiling face]
