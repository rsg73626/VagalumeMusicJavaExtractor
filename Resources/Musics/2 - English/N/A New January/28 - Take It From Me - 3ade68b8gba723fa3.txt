TAKE IT FROM ME

Murder engulfs my eyes
So clueless like my life
Confusion's all up on me
Never first the things you want to hear
Fall upon your tears
You're never too hard for me
All vinyl cherries and cream
You're not the first and you're not the same
You're nothing
So starved, so weak

Flow like the river
In your sheep skin boat
It gets hard to breathe with me on your throat
Final catch and throw back before today
There's one more thing I'd like to say

Take it from me
Lost my heart
Take it from me
My barren soul
Take it from me
You tear it apart
I know exactly what you are

Faith, so blinded by white fears
Words falling on deaf ears
Your sympathy's nothing I need
Flesh and bone and stars watch you fall and sink
Stop your lies, it's not what you think
Coal for cash gets you nothing, nowhere
We only picture in dreams
It's not the first and you're not the same
You're nothing
So starved, so weak
