GREEN

I am here, and this is me
Black and blue, and green with envy
Bothered and torn with every word
You're sinking deeper as it's heard
You've seen another once before
And now you want to feel me even more

Moving towards the corner
The air too thick to breathe
The walls are thin and hollow
Your blood is thick, like grease
So you remove the middle
Broke off and roaming free
We start to choke and laugh again
You're finally feeling free

The more you want
It breaks your head and hands again
The more you want
You're not content with half again
The more you want
Beautiful looks are just for show
The more you want
That's all you really need to know
