BLEED

And if you present a plan
For something outrageous
Expect me to ponder
Not that it'll change us

I try to save up the plan
Then try to perfect the scheme
Move a little closer
[I love how you bleed]
You know I want it to drip
I love how it feels
You're my favorite addiction
[I love how you bleed]

Hungry blood shot eyes
Just like the trembling knees
Of a hairy spider with nothing to eat
With my tiny mouth and my scratchy fleas
I'm dying to slow down
[I love how you bleed]
