CHANGE

Well there goes another tragedy
Straight from my heart
I think I'm going to run away
And join some kind of cult
Where everybody knows
That sanity is the highest price
Even if you go and leave me angry

What if we all gave in?
Would it solve anything?
What if we all walked away?
Would anything ever change?

I want to leave you there
In this state of tragedy
Well there's so much proof
In this world of lies
And I feel the pain inside myself
And I let it go and show the world
Even if you go and leave me angry
