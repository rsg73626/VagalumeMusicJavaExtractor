NEXT TO NOTHING

Plugging in 8-bit, low-res fusion charms all the whores
[Rape my faith away)
Only 19, pierced, so divided, delighted
She's promised and sworn
[Tears erode the days)
Braver than all these fears realize
Now that everything's gone
Over-driven denial collides you to free discolored angelic breakthrough

I hope my dreams develope just like film
But it's next to nothing
Reacting leaves me with violent chlorophyll
But it's next to nothing
Ripped away I've seen my limits burn
But it's next to nothing

All the things I've ever lost and found
And all the things they say to push you down
I'm holding back the sky without a sound

You'll be begging for my undivided
So impartial, undecided
Trace my halo's waiting with your
Immaculate complaining
Despite ultimate sacrifice
I feel like I'm a hanging Christ
