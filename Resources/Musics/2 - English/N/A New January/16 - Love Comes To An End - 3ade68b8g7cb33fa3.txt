LOVE COMES TO AN END

I think I think too much
About everything I shouldn't even
Give a second thought to
I know you can't see right through me
If everything I said didn't really seem
To make much sense
That's just because I never really cared
To make it seem that way

If you didn't stop you'd never know
When our love comes to an end
And you couldn't see
What you mean to me
When our love comes to an end

By the way I never knew you
Or gave a second thought to
This lovely situation
It's all a bit too complicated
Maybe we should end it all right now
And pretend we never happened
What goes around comes around
