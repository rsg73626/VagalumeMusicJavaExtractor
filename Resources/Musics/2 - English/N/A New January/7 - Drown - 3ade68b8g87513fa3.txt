DROWN

Underwater, I'm dragging you down
Bubbles come from your frown
And below I watch you drown

With jet black ink and eight legs
It's not what you think it's always
Silent and sleek it seems like
Watching you sink is so nice
Watching you drown
I'm watching you drown

Air so thinned out
Ocean blocks all your sound
In your ear and your mouth
Splash and choke I watch you drown
Salt water sting sedate waves
Relax and scream it's all vain
Sliced up and free, a cheap knife
Watching you drown
