VIRTUES

Well I'm always grateful
For the old metal fans
That spun in your eyes
Cooling what looks like
I might leave you
And the mercury
You had for blood
Which clung together
For life and us
The possibility leaves me senseless

Now I'm battling out thoughts
Into tiny, grey, tin ears
It wasn't gravity that took you down
The stone walls of our lives
'Cause the pounding in my heart
All that, well I took for granted
