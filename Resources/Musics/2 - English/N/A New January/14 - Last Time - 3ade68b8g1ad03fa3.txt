LAST TIME

You weren't that bad the last time
And I know I'm not your first
Believe me, when I said I need you
Those weren't only words
She said, "Sometimes I feel like
I should be alone and not with anyone
Sometimes I feel like I should be in love"

Something's not quite right
Despite the things I've tried
It's different from the way I felt before
The last time

Undeserving hypocrite
You said there's nothing
You haven't seen yet
I believe your every word like a naive child
For the last time
