WITHOUT YOU

I lay here in my own bed
With her on my mind
There's nothing else for me to do
On the summer I was left behind
I take my chances on my own
No, I don't xxxxxxx mind
What else is there to do
When I'm the one who's left behind?

In a place we used to go
I sit and think of her
And where am I supposed to be
When I should be with you?
In a blood red misery
I'd lay my head on your chest
Holding tight I'm loosing grip
And living without you

A year has passed in short time
And now it's about time
I admit you were always on my mind
And I finally submit
I blew my chance and destroyed
Any hope I ever had
And now I'm without you
