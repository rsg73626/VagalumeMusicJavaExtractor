RANDOM

Iowa, is that your real name?
The flesh of Jesus Christ

What exactly is a new January?
My parent's were hippies

So are you guys alternative or what?
If you smell it, it must be fish

Digital electro-dance dementia
Don't be afraid, it's only jizz

I will not be a loser
The protection you need in the colors you want

You are already an outcast
Sometimes things just fall off

Sounds that go...
We're a new January
