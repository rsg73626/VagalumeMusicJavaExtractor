MESSIAH

I wish you were here
To introduce me
To this crazy, mixed-up crowd
Sometimes you're downright rude
This feels just like the wood you burn
And my knees are just so weak
And my voice sounds
My voice sounds too paper thin

Just like the monument who stands
With his cement pose
I'm in the way again
Keeping them from drowning
Out what they know

You couldn't handle
Any more than you could read
Those fake life parodies
About how the blind can't lead
Try standing on your own
And find what life's about
Don't believe in everything
Once you're in there's no way out
