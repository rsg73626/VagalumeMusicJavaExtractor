HIDDEN

I noticed something a little, somewhat flawed
Your precious space
Your favorite spot
Was it a special place where you wanted to?
It was just beyond your point of view
It was like that thought you couldn't bare
Not exactly what you'd want to share

Your transparencies just holding me
Too xxxxxxx thick
I deserve to see
Just about everything
But it's too hard to think

I didn't feel the passion so far inside
In my favorite place you tried to hide
You tried to hope
You're not alone
Vain trial search
You look for even more
