BABBLE

Unlocked and chained at the same time
Unstopping waste, this perfect crime
Don't know how I can avoid this
On page 65 they use their fists
Without proper use it can't begin
To hope and pray that this will end

Unbearably we sit through this and wait until it's over
Impossibly, uncomfortably we wait until it's over
The empty words
The mindless talk
We wait until it's over
With moving lips like open gates
We wait until it's over

The hours start to feel like days
Sarcastic verbal garbage waste
Just when the wet dirt forms to clay
I try to find the words to say
