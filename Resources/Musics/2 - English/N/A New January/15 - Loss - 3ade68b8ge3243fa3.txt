LOSS

Warm vibrations touch my ear
Misplaced meaning's, crystal clear
Screaming words like fingers take
Try hard to move the other way

Tender bruises start to show
Hurting truth begins to grow
He'd spit it out, then stop for days
Afraid to speak, consequences great
If it wasn't for you I could never know
With one easy touch
The blood starts to flow

Your leather never felt that soft before
Purple, black, blue, and brown
Colors match the ugly ground
