FRENCH DIP

This room's so full of vibrant
Contaminating mixes
Of the world's most precious
And sought-after
Colors for the few who endure
This bleached out bubble bath
Sometimes you make me laugh
Or maybe it's the fact

You weren't born with what you want

By the way you looked just fine
The way you were
Before you burned your head
Are mine perverted thoughts
Of hate, and lust, and sex
The ends don't look the same
As when they're soaking wet

Can't you feel it
Burning deep inside?
Can't you see
The damage that it's done?
So deep
You can hardly feel
The roots can't hold in now
Like they once could
So now it all falls out
