DOWNPLAY

Religious differences divide
Families deny
Starving minds crave for more
Wet youthful sands, still thirsting shores
Washed away by open air
Useless thoughts of hopes and cares

Being downplayed
Still being downplayed
Being downplayed
Like nervous stares
As they watch with nervous stares
Still being downplayed
Being downplayed
Still being downplayed
Like nervous stares

They watch the world bow to its knees
Ignore the hopes and worthless dreams
Hear the voices of the loved
Those words of strength came from above
They learn the ways they learn the songs
Deep inside it felt so wrong
