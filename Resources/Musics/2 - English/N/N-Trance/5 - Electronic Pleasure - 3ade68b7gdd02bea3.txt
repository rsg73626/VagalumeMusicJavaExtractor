ELECTRONIC PLEASURE

Verse 1:
Systematic rhythm in control
Has left me in a world without emotion in my soul
And my desire, it feels like fire
Electrifying energy of life
Generates a power to a beat as cold as ice
And my desire, it takes you higher, higher, higher
Oh ya-yi-yi (x8)

Verse 2:
Automatic systems that fascinate
Dancin' in a trance my mind and body activated
My desire, it feels like fire
Accelerate the feeling ev'rywhere
Electronic pleasure makes the music fill the air
And my desire, it takes you higher, higher, higher
Oh ya-yi-yi (x8)

Rap:
Get ready ta flex, I'll make ya bounce to these rough raw rhymes in your mind and the galaxies.
Coz in the 95 season size is on a roll, pass da remote control.
So I can change it up, I gets a ten 'n' a half for mashin da bass up,
and it don't matter what they say, I'm like a pentium chip and every line carries 8k.
I come with the digital, electric pleasure here comes the pressure.
Known to be the man on the jams on the street fighter 2 coz my style kicks the kung fu.
Or you can get open, I got a fat PC with a 14.4 modem,
now here comes the pressure, my interpretation of electric pleasure.
