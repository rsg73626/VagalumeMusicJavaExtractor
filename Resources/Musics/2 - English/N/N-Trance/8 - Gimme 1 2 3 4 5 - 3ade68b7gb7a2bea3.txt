Jerome:
Check out the one to groove on it's time to swing (pump pump it) everybody kickin' to the
bassline hittin' it won't be missin' open your eyes and listen. Don't hold back the feelin' coz this is somethin' gonna
push you to the ceilin' it's a rhythm trian so get on it ya feelin' cooped up a then let's get flowin' it now. Diddly did-
dly de bop bop I just won't stop, the tasty rhythm bouncin' from da bottom to da top, coz it's just like this you see,
not complicated in fact it's very elementary simple easy just like this, so it's time to rev up time to unwind, it's time
to get loose, and it's time to grind not till I heard Ricardo bust da reminda.
