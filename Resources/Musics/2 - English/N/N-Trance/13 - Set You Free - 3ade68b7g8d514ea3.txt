SET YOU FREE

When I hold you baby
Feel your heartbeat close to me
Wanna stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free

Set you free
Set you free
Set you free
Set you free...

When I wake each morning
And the storm beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free

Set you free
Set you free
Set you free...

When we touch each other
In a state of ecstasy
Wants this night to last forever
Only love can set you free
