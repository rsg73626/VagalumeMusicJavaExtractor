NOTHING LASTS FOREVER

All alone again
I’ve been like this before
To feel your world is closing in
And there’s no open door
Do you know, I can’t sleep at night
When you’re not by my side
if no-one’s there to hold me close
Then how can I survive

Nothing lasts forever
You can take control
It’s now or never
Nothing lasts forever
We’ll never be together
Together


I remember now
The day you walked away
And even now as time goes by
It feels like yesterday
Why am I, still living in the past
When everything has gone
I’ll keep a place inside my heart
But now I’m moving on 

Nothing lasts forever
You can take control
It’s now or never
Nothing lasts forever
We’ll never be together
Together
