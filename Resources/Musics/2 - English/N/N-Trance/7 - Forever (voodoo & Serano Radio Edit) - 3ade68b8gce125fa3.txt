FOREVER (VOODOO & SERANO RADIO EDIT)

Hearin' my voice

Call out to you
It takes control
What can you do?

Follow me
Wherever I go
You don't have to
Be on your own

So hold me forever
Let's stay together never let me go
Hold me forever
I'm lost without you won't you take me home

Maybe we're all from another planet?
Maybe we're all insane?
Maybe we're all from another planet?

At night reach
Towards the sky
The world you see
Beside my eyes

And you know
You've been here before
Always with me
You're never alone

So hold me forever
Let's stay together never let me go
Hold me forever
I'm lost without you won't you take me home

So hold me forever
Let's stay together never let me go
Hold me forever
I'm lost without you won't you take me home
