(JUST) LET IT GO

Verse 1:
So I tell you that it's over
Now you're standing on your own
Left to face the world alone
Never thought that I would leave you
Ya didn't mean that much to me
I was just a fantasy
I never cheated, never lied.
Never could get through to you no matter how I tried
Didn't hurt you, or make you cry
I guess you know the reason why I said goodbye.

Chorus:
Just let it go - reach for the sky
Just let it go - take my body high
Just let it go - straight to the top
Just let it go - don't you ever stop     (x2).

Verse 2:
Once again the phone is ringing
I try to make it clear to you
Can't you realize we're through
But you never get the message
Hangin' up's all I can do
I don't wanna torture you
It isn't easy, what I've done
Can't you just accept that I am happy now you're gone
I know you're sorry, but it's true
Get up off the floor boy what ya gonna do?

Chorus

Rap:
