I WILL TAKE YOU THERE

Verse 1:
Oceans of the world surrounding me
I'm drifting like a wave upon the sea
I'll treasure every moment in my life
Reaching destiny in paradise.

Chorus:
I will take you there
Together we will be
I will take you there
Will you follow me?

Verse 2:
Endless days and nights you wait
Looking for a way but can't escape
Walking the deserts burning sands
Still trying to find a way baby, to the promised land.

Repeat Chorus
