I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOUR LOVE...AGAIN

Verse 1:
Here we stand
You say I haven't changed
But I can hide my tears
Like crying in the rain
Then you raise a smile
That touches deep inside
For when you feel there's hope
It's hard to keep your pride.

Chorus:
See baby if I had the chance to
I would always choose you
Even though I know you'll break my heart
I'm tired of being lonely
So baby won't you hold me
Coz I don't wanna lose your love again.

Verse 2:
You'd better close the door
And step into the light
My eyes shine brightly, once more
Like candles in the night
Standing face to face
Open arms they shall embrace you
But in my dreams I'll keep the fears of knowing
One day like before, I could lose you.

Chorus
