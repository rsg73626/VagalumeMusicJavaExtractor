THAT'S ALL WE NEED

Verse 1: Here I go again, singing like we did back then
Don't you ever hear the words I say
Why do you go to war, tell me what you're fighting for
Will you ever see another day.
I don't care about race or religion, it's hard to fight, easy to listen
Live your life before it's gone, making sense where there is none
See the sun as it starts a new day, watch the clouds as they're turning away
Takin' away the fear and greed, just a little hope is what we need.

Chorus:
People let me hear you say
(All we need is some love, some love)
(That's all we need)     (x4).

Verse 2:
I just can't forget, how did I feel no regret
When I think of all the things I've done
Then a tear will fall, makes my life seem very small
Looking down the barrel of a gun.
Why is it our nature to kill? We always have, we always will
Find a way for life to survive, only faith can keep us alive
Out of the dark and in to the light, a new beginning is in sight
Now it's time to follow my lead, just a little trust is what we need.

Repeat Chorus

Rap:
Now here comes the love daddy 'O' wid ma sugar flow leave da world alone give the young ones a chance to
grow up, a drink from the fountains of love, all wars will end, all colours should blend. Coz I be the same as you be
but when someone sees me, even though I'm raw I'm still humanity, and it don't matter what ya use ta, we are the
world and we be da future.

Repeat Chorus
