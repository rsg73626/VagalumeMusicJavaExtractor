SHAKE YA BODY

Shake your body, your lovely body (x3)
Shake your body, shake your body

Once again we be coming right back,
With another blast from the past and you know that
Everybody's been stealing our style,
But now they're in the where are they now file
Drop the new improved Jackson groove, silky smooth
Bust a move, I can't lose, coz I'm,
Dressed to kill, I'm king of the hill, I got,
More girls than, Benny Hill
So, how ya feelin', have ya missed us,
Even if you hate us you can't resist
Nine nine hit the rewind,
MJ and the five and we still got the vibe, come on

*Let's dance let's shout,
shake your body down to the ground. (x4)**

Kelly:
Get down down down down down (x2)*

Sit back relax unwind, and let the good times roll
Fill ya body and soul, with the sound of N-Trance
Making ya dance do the limbo!
Viva Latina (Kelly)
Gonna make ya rock, never stop, reach the top,
Get down with the king 'o' pop
There's a brand new kind on the scene
I'M A ONE MAN DANCING MACHINE
I know what ya wanna do,
Gonna party all night, get down wid da crew
That's right when we do our thing,
Let the DJ play, I wanna hear you sing

*~*Repeat

It's the sun sea sand and the rest,
All the ladies dressed to impress
Music pumping loud in the clubs,
Makes the summertime feel so good
Get down to the seventies sound with a funky lick,
It's a Jackson tip, with a remix
On the dancefloor through the night,
Marlon, Tito, Jermaine, Jackie, Mike

*~**Repeat (x2)
