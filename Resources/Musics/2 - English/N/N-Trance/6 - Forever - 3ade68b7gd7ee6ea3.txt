FOREVER

Maybe we're on another planet...
Maybe we're all insane....

You hear my voice call out to you
It takes control, what can you do?
Follow me wherever I go
You don't have to be on your own

So hold me forever
Let's stay together, never let me go
So hold me forever
I'm lost without you, won't you take me home

At night you reach towards the sky
The world you see inside me eyes
And you know you've been here before
Always with me, you're never alone

So hold me forever
Let's stay together, never let me go
So hold me forever
I'm lost without you, won't you take me home

So hold me forever
Let's stay together, never let me go
So hold me forever
I'm lost without you, won't you take me home

So hold me forever
Let's stay together, never let me go
So hold me forever
I'm lost without you, won't you take me home
