BONELESS

Stepped on this board and it swallowed me whole
It made me lose my mind but it redefined my soul
It taught me some lessons on how to take some pain
It made me lose my mind but it kept me sane

It s not a sport it s an art

Stepped on this board and I just let it roll
I've broken some bones but I ve gained complete
control
knew this was a feeling I never could lose
learned how to skate and live the way I choose

It s not a sport it s an art
It s not your head it s your heart

you think these words are cheezy I think they re fucking great
you d never understand them
if you never learned to skate
