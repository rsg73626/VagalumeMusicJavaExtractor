WEREWOLF

Inescapable darkness draws us in
It is here the unspeakable
Murder will be consummated

Nothing is ever quiet here
Nothing ever changes

But the end is near
And we will have reached our destination
Turn our gaze away
Choose nothingness
Gates closed behind us
Boundless the deep below us

Nothing is ever quiet here
Nothing ever changes
