FLAMES OF THE PIT

In the blood soaked mud
Left to die unknown
Deceiving propaganda
Your love will not reach home
The trench you dug
Your grave without a stone
Surrender to death
And hand in your head

Life that was holy
Disease
Flames of the pit
The darkness of nothingness
Be thy grail

Cremated visions
Of the prophet fool
Hanging pallid
As its wishes grew
Another being
Another lie
Life that was holy
Is fake and weak
