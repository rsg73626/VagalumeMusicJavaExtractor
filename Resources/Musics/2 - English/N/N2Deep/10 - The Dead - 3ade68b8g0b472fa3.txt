THE DEAD

Laughter
Like thunder from the sky
Attacked by all armies
Deprived of their lives
Vengeance
Spawned by their hatred
Twice as pure as blood
Now more than ever before

We saw death
Cried out for more
the planet stood still
Machines were at war

Out of the ashes
We have created this image
Of superior beings
Alternating our existance

Breed as we die
This fanatic illusion
Spinning out of control
We died ages ago
