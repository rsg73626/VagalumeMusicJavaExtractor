PERFECT HATE

I am god's cancer
I am the hunter
Where ever you are you will be found
Potential is all around
In a slow pace you crawl
A trail of blood and skin
Marks your downfall

Tell me of your tortures
I'll try not to laugh
An abomination
You should see yourself

Punsih you beyond belief
No set rules for you to follow
I treat you as I see fit
Your hands are tied
Yesterday i needed you
Today you're going to die

Human flesh
Human life
Destroy everything
All the good inside
Watch it all die

Behold the coming of the
Lord!!!
