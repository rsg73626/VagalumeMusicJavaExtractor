PALLBEARER

Pale skin lifeless eyes
Blood running from their mouths
Gaping sounds, scabs and sores
Skin hanging from their bones

I am alone
No one can see me
No one knows
The darkness within me

Death is what I love
Its sinister rituals
The dead are in my mind

Night falls
Life drains
On my altar
Life ends

Death is what I love
Its sinister rituals
The dead are here with me
