SILENCE THE EARTH

Like a raging fire
Consuming the remnants of life
The final holocaust
Swept across all land

Silence fell
Upon the earth
All gods were dead
We killed them first

Twilight fell
Upon the earth
The soil was red
We quenched our thirst for blood

The shredded flesh
Scorched in the sun
Now resting, rotting
On barren ground

And darkness fell
Upon the earth
A silent planet
All life erased
