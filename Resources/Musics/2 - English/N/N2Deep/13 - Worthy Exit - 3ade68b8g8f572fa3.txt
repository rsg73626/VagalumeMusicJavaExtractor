WORTHY EXIT

Fall into the pit
Close your eyes
Leave the world
Behind you
Eternal darkness waits
Make the final leap and fall
Excitement builds
Blood flows

Gasping for air
Choking on your blood
Your bones broken
Your body disfigured
Torn to shreds
Your innards on the outside

Fall...down

Gasping for air
Choking on your blood
Now on the ground
A bloody mess
Still barely breathing
Your death is so painful
The truth so dreadful
Wish you were dreaming

Your high hopes
We're set to see you fall

Fall...down
