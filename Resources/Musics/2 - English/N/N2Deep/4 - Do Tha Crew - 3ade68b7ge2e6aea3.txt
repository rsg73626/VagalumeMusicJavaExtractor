DO THA CREW

[ VERSE 1: Jay Tee ]
They'll pay your for that donkey
If you know how to rap and get funky
But if yo shit don't sound good
I guess yo dick gotta stay on wood
But me (What's up?) I get mine (Ah-ha)
Check into the telly 'bout half past nine
And when I check out it's ten to two
My knees is week cause I got blew
So let me put you on my list
Of the dookie broads that I can't kiss
And next time that you see me
Bitch, don't even talk to me
Cause the only damn thing that you can do
Is hit the dirt and do my crew

[ CHORUS ]
Do the crew, do the crew
Do the crew, you gotta do the crew
Come on, do the crew, you gotta do the crew
You wanna get with me, you gotta do them too

Do them too
You gotta do them too
Do them too
That's right, hoe

[ VERSE 2: Jay Tee ]
Now let me put it like this
Baby, I ain't tryin to diss
But now I know who you are, so I don't think we can kiss
You look good, and maybe I might be wrong
But now I know where you been and the list is long
You been in motel, hotel, holiday inns
You been with most of my cousins and all my friends
And in a Benz way out in the Crest
Doin the wop, the crew thing and the strictly sess
Hard knob, baby, you're gettin raw, baby
And for a couple of bucks you give jaw, baby
So here's a ten spot, now hit your knees
Do me first and then do Tee
We'll bust that nut and we'll shake it off
Pull up our draws and we're takin off
Hit the gas and we're gone
But you ain't through
You gotta do my crew

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Jay Tee ]
Now even though you got switch, bitch, you ain't all that
I wouldn't give you the goods unless I had on a hat
Cause yo kitty cat has done some time
You been with every muthafucka who knows how to rhyme
So if you wanna get with Jay Tee
Bitch, you gon' have to pay me
So kick me down just a few
And go and give my partners some dollars too
Cause yo, this ain't no solo creep
It's a package deal, N2Deep
20 steep brothers that are true and love to screw
But not tonight, hoe, we wanna get blew
So do us up, and I mean well
Don't even trip, hoe, we won't tell
That Michelle from Vallejo is cool
We gonna keep it to ourselves that you do the crew

[ CHORUS ]

Ah yeah
Check it out though
Now that I got everybody and they mama hooked up
I'm gon' let y'all handle it
cause I'm tired of these toss-ups
So K-Rock, you the player coach tonight
so you go 'head and write the line-up
I know you got ( ? ) and just go 'head
Give me a call tomorrow and let me know how it went do
Aight then
Do them too
