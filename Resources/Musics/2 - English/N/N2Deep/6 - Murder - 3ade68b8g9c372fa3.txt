MURDER

Thought you were indestructible
But now you have lost all control
Before this night is over
You will feel the power
Of my knife carving away at your gut
The blood gushes
Your life is fading

No remores in these eyes
Only the wish for you to die
I cause you pain
I murder

You stare with terror in your eyes
Beholding the instrument of your
Imminent demise
You stare in disbelief
You shiver with fear
Begging for your life
As your untimely death
Draws near

No remores in these eyes
Only the wish for you to die
I cause you pain
I murder
