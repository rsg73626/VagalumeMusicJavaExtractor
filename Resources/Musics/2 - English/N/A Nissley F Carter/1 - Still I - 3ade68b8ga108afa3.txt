STILL I

From the moment that I turned and walked away
I remember all the things I meant to say
Now could it be that maybe I'm afraid
To love you truly

And then I look into your eyes all I could see
Is the future and the possibilities
And could it be that you're my destiny
But you won't let me

Something going wrong
Something going wrong
Somethings got me going crazy
Like I don't know you at all

And I want you back
But not like that
Not like that

Baby can't you see
Love is killing me
Girl you got me going crazy
And I don't know you at all

Still I want you back
But not like that
Not like that

I remember all the times I held your hand
Still you don't care to help me undestand
I thought that I was more than just a friend
Baby tell me something

Or could it be that you don't feel for me
And maybe I'm just lost in fantasy
Hoping maybe you were meant for me
You won't let me

Something going wrong
Something going wrong
Somethings got me going crazy
Like I don't know you at all

And I want you back
But not like that
Not like that

Baby can't you see
Love is killing me
Girl you got me going crazy
And I don't know you at all

Still I want you back
But not like that
Not like that

In my mind
I have tried to find someone
Who makes me feel like
All the ways that you seem to do

If you know
You can still
Loke to seem to choose
In my pen
In my book
My pencils

Something going wrong
Something going wrong
Somethings got me going crazy
Like I don't know you at all

And I want you back
But not like that
Not like that

Baby can't you see
Love is killing me
Girl you got me going crazy
And I don't know you at all

Still I want you back
But not like that
Not like that
