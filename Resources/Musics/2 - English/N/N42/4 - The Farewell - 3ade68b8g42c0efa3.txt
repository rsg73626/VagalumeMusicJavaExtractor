THE FAREWELL

Once again I’m here, I’m not trying to bring back the past,
I just want you to know, all I did and said it was my best.
But it seems that to you it doesn’t matter anything I do,
You’re never satisfied, I’ve been a fool for all this fucking time.

But you said that was a lie everything I’ve felt for you,
So you leave, no farewell, you fucking kill me, you do.
Do not hate me, the player just press start and enjoy,
Lovers come and then they’re gone, this is not the time to stop.

I won’t crawl, I won’t cry, I’ll just write you a song to say you bye,
And to say watch behind, I’m still here thinking of you all the time.
It’s so hard to heal the pain, why so hard to start all over again?
If everything was a lie, why is not easy to say you bye?

But you said that was a lie everything I’ve felt for you,
So you leave, no farewell, you fucking kill me, you do.
Do not hate me, the player just press start and enjoy,
Lovers come and then they’re gone, it’s almost the time to stop.

But you said that was a lie everything I’ve felt for you,
So you leave, no farewell, you fucking kill me, you do.
Do not hate me, the player just press start and enjoy,
Lovers come and then they’re gone, this is the time to stop.
