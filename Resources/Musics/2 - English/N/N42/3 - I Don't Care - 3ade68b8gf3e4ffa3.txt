I DON'T CARE

I don't care, I really do not care.
This hole you can't escape, this place is now your grave.
You know that you deserve it, you lived like a tool,
And never had own opinion, always been a fool!
You must be ashamed, 'cause now they are lookin' at you
You're dying and they won't help, and now you know the truth!
Nobody loved you so, nobody misses you so!
Accept your fate and go, nobody will misses you sir!

I don't care about you
I can carry on, believe me, with or without you
Don't ask me for excuses
If you acted like me you can not me judge an useless!(2x)

There're times in life, you thought you're the only one.
There's nobody like you. sorry if it's hurting you.
But now you need to know, you're just another one
It's hard to accept, it's hard but they will forget you.
We know the life is not what it supposed to be
It's easy to understand, you were a fool my friend
Nobody loved you so, nobody misses you so!
Accept your fate and go, nobody will misses you sir! ( let's go)

I don't care about you
I can carry on, believe me, with or without you
Don't ask me for excuses
If you acted like me you can not me judge an useless!(2x)
