HUMANS

How many times, you faced yourself in the mirror
Do you feel proud of what you've done?!
For what it's worth for you in the end
If you will become another person?

How many times you asked yourself, who are you
And who you wanna be?
They pushed you to mold you
To become a "regular person"

What kind of world are we living?
If our real differences are dying
Instead of uniting us all,
As human beings which we are (2x)

Yo, yo, they say that you can be just right way your are,
But all we know it's bullshit, this is the biggest lie.
They crucify you, they point their fingers on me,
But if I don't believe in gods, this is my business b.
Well if I get a tattoo I'm against the law,
But what about those killers in three-piece we saw?
They wanna make you feel empty, guilty and insecure,
So let's put them on their knees to show who make the rules! 
(let's go)

So let's put them on their knees to show who make the rules!

?we don't share the same faith,
We don't share the same color skin,
But we're breathing the same air?
