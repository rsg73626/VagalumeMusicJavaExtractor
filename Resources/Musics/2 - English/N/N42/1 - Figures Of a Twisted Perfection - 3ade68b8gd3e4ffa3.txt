FIGURES OF A TWISTED PERFECTION

Innocent eyes and the purest smile
Chaos inside while the beauty it's outside
Day after day hour after hour
She's covering up every sin with a smile

Delicate ways, designed shape
Rejected, bored, passionate
Everything's on your right place

Figures of a twisted perfection,
Hunted by your own reflections,
You are going down, down, down
Bipolar ways from destructive thoughts

The greatest one is unquestionable
Fighting for something I can't describe
Victims again in another senseless battle
Hunting in the night, freaking burning in the light

The biggest lier, dreamed lover
Stressed, angry, complicated
Everything is so frustrating

Figures of a twisted perfection,
Hunted by your own reflections,
You are going down, down, down
Bipolar ways from destructive thoughts
