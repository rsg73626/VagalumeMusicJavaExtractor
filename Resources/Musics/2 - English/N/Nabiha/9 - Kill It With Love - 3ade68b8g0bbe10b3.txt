KILL IT WITH LOVE

(Verse)
I look and I run
But I'm still stuck in the same old pace
I look to the sun
But the only thing I feel is the rain on my face
The words that they say
Cut like grass when I'm ridin in my hood
I push them away, no sticks and stones make my bones break

(Pre-Chorus)
So I put my feet on the ground
Something in the way, walk around
I've got nothing to prove
All we need to do is

(Chorus x2)
Kill it with love!
Don't let it hurt you
Kill it with love!
Don't let em break you
Kill it with love!
Nothing can get to you
All we really need to do is
(Kill it with love!)

(Verse)
Look what I've done
I'm up high, standing ten feet tall
Gravity's gone
I'll let go cause I know I won't fall!

(Pre-Chorus)
So I put my feet on the ground
Something in the way, walk around
I've got nothing to prove
All we need to do is

(Chorus x2)
Kill it with love!
Don't let it hurt you
Kill it with love!
Don't let em break you
Kill it with love!
Nothing can get to you
All we really need to do is
(Kill it with love!)

(Bridge x2)
Love will make the world go round
The world go round, the world go round!
Love will make the world go round
The world go round, the world go round!

(Chorus x2)
Kill it with love!
Don't let it hurt you
Kill it with love!
Don't let em break you
Kill it with love!
Nothing can get to you
All we really need to do is
(Kill it with love!)
