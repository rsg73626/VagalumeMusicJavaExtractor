HEARTBREAKER

(Verse)
I'm so in love with you
That's what you told me, and when you hold me
I know you do
And I like the way you're comfortable
You're thoughtful, you're strong for me
And that's sweet and all, but I don't know, yeah

(Pre-Chorus)
Maybe I got a screw loose, but I want crazy baby
For wanting to hold hands with you, just want that, ah

(Chorus)
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world I would rather do
Than makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up

(Verse)
Boy, take a look at you
You're so perfect, I know you're worth it
But I'm not for you
And though I love the way your body talks
Your fingers work, like my skin hurts
Still I gotta do what, what I gotta do, yeah

(Pre-Chorus)
Maybe I got a screw loose, but I want crazy baby
For wanting to hold hands with you, just want that, ah

(Chorus x2)
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world I would rather do
Than makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up

(Verse)
You're the only one that I was trippin off
Game time, once it's glued, and she kicked it off
Damn baby, just consider me a mixtape
No shelf life, but it felt right
And here I was thinking what we have was classic
On the inside, you was doing backflips
Where we go when the sex ain't enough though?
You texting me about 7O's
My bad I was counting
But after all that it was it felt special
Now the room better, get in love, coming with the 30 day special
Now I'm gonna let go, blow

(Chorus x2)
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world I would rather do
Than makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up

First we gotta break up
First we gotta break up
First we gotta break up
