FEARLESS

Lyrics to Fearless
(Verse)
Heard all of the stories
Bought all of the lies
Felt so far from glory
Kept shutting my eyes

(Pre-Chorus)
We give and we take, create then break
We got fire in the soul
But we do as we're told
Wasting away, to numb all the pain, mm
Scared to get old and being alone
Throwing away what we rightfully own
Who's to decide what's wrong and what's right

(Chorus)
If we could be fearless, fearless
Every heart knows, that's where the love grows
Fearless, fearless
Let all your love show
Then there'll be no more fear

(Verse)
Caught up in the system
Forgetting that I
I'm living and breathing
I won't fall out of life

(Pre-Chorus)
We give and we take, create then break
We got fire in the soul
But we do as we're told
Wasting away, to numb all the pain, mm
Scared to get old and being alone
Throwing away what we rightfully own
Who's to decide what's wrong and what's right

(Chorus)
If we could be fearless, fearless
Every heart knows, that's where the love grows
Fearless, fearless
Let all your love show
Then there'll be no more fear

(Bridge)
Fire in my soul, I got fire in my soul
And I got fire in my soul, and I got fire in my soul

Heard all of the stories
Now minding my own!

(Chorus)
If we could be fearless, fearless
Every heart knows, that's where the love grows
Fearless, fearless
Let all your love show
Then there'll be no more fear
