PERFECTLY HUMAN

(Verse)
I'm like a hurricane, I'm sun and then I'm rain
I'm tearing down my walls, one by one
I feel unstoppable, I stumble then I fall
Just like a shooting star, here I come

(Pre-Chorus)
I could be the one to turn you around
I could be the gun that shoots to shoot you down
I could be the love you've waited for
Perfectly human
I could be the highest price to pay
I could say yes or I could make you wait
I could be the love you can't ignore
Perfectly human

(Chorus)
I would be, if we could just be
Forget about you, forget about me
You know that I give it all
You're so beautiful
And I'll always wear my heart up on my sleeve

(Verse)
I love the skin I'm in
Inside I'm battling
I'm diamond in the cold
Still shining
I'm everything I feel
I hurt and then I heal
Just over the horizon climbing

(Pre-Chorus)
I could be the one to turn you around
I could be the gun that shoots to shoot you down
I could be the love you've waited for
Perfectly human
I could be the highest price to pay
I could say yes or I could make you wait
I could be the love you can't ignore
Perfectly human

(Chorus)
I would be, if we could just be
Forget about you, forget about me
You know that I give it all
You're so beautiful
And I'll always wear my heart up on my sleeve

I'm like a hurricane, I'm sun and then I'm rain
I'm tearing down my walls, one by one
