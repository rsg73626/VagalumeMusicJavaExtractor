THE ENEMY

Funny how we see eachother everyday
You can finish any line I'm gunna say
And your the first one that I call on for a point of view
I'm always down with your ladyfriends
And im here to the end and back again
Much you dont know about
There's one thing that I keep from you

My mind is making no sense
I live a life of pretense
I'm the queen of patience for you
I go out of my way
To help you find what your looking for
Just to show you the new improved me
Hold your hand when your restless
I'm tied to secrecy
But I go tingly and warm inside
And I hope you remember me well
When your in with the enemy

Every now and then when I'm out with you
I try to drop a hint or a massive clue
Tho every part of my body says it's a waste of time
I could turn around now, but I don't know
I'm in love and I don't wan't the antidote
All I wanna do is make you open 
your eyes and read the signs

My mind is making no sense
I live a life of pretense
I'm the queen of patience for you

I go out of my way
To help you find what your looking for
Just to show you the new improved me
Hold your hand when your restless
I'm tied to secrecy
But I go tingly and warm inside
And I hope you remember me well
When your in with the enemy

Get out of my way
Get out of my way yeah

Get out of my way
Get out of my way yeah

I go out of my way
To help you find what your looking for
Just to show you the new improved me
Hold your hand when your restless
I'm tied to secrecy
But I go tingly and warm inside
And I hope you remember me well
When your in with the enemy

I go out of my way
To help you find what your looking for
Just to show you the new improved me
Hold your hand when your restless
I'm tied to secrecy
But I go tingly and warm inside
And I hope you remember me well
When your in with the enemy
