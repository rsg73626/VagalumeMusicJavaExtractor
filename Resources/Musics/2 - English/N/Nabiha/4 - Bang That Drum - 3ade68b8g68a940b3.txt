BANG THAT DRUM

Nothing can stop now that I'm flying
This is the moment
Wanna shout it out!
On the horizon my star is rising
This is the moment
Wanna shout it out!

I'MMA BANG THAT DRUM!
BANG BANG THAT DRUM!

Gonna start a fire
And I coming ready for you, for you
We can take it higher, higher
You can put me in and watch me go
We can make a superhero rocket
You set me off, off
Wanna start a riot
I'm a killer, I'm a ranger
Gonna make it brighter, brighter
You can put me in and watch me go
We can make a superhero rocket
You set me off, off

Nothing can stop now that I'm flying
This is the moment
Wanna shout it out!
On the horizon my star is rising
This is the moment
Wanna shout it out!
Gotta keep climbing higher, and higher
Because the world is in my hands
Nothing can stop me now that I'm flying

I'MMA BANG THAT DRUM!
BANG BANG THAT DRUM!

This is it, it's now or never, on the edge I'm boxing clever
And tonight I live forever
Make a, make a wish!
I'd be really on rocket
You set this off

Nothing can stop now that I'm flying
This is the moment
Wanna shout it out!
On the horizon my star is rising
This is the moment
Wanna shout it out!
Gotta keep climbing higher, and higher
Because the world is in my hands
Nothing can stop me now that I'm flying

I'MMA BANG THAT DRUM!
BANG BANG THAT DRUM!
I'MMA BANG THAT DRUM!
BANG BANG THAT DRUM!
