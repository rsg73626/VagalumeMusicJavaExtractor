HALO & HANDCUFFD

(Verse)
Eyes with two lovers would seem some shit
She cannot tell my Adam's apple from my fist
Well language of the tears when they falling from your eyes
Can you tell me what language do you laugh in or smile
Be we're just little and in a lingo or lost
Did you put your own heart in the freezer next to the thought?
Of me, of us, halos as our handcuffs
Break up till we make up, break up till we wake up

(Verse)
See the storm before me
And the world into your eyes
Gotta turn before it
Clouds my mind
When the silence hits me
At this point I just don't know
Is the calm before we
About to blow

(Bridge)
Walking with a dark cloud over your head
Feeling pain
Best thing might just be to let it rain
Might just be to let it rain

(Pre-Chorus)
Can we go to start?
And start it over you and be
Say yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Tel it from the heart
Well love is unpredictable
Say yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

(Chorus)
Can we go to start? Start over
Can we go to start? Start over
Can we go to start? Start over
Halo as our handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs

(Verse)
Since you took off then let's be alone well
Plenty of time to mourn nothing to grow with
Except a few pounds do the comfort needing
Four days I didn't leave her garden of Eden
Guess that we're fully grown
But guess you can't pass happiness to a too big room
Apartment, fretch door stuck on ceilings
You look like the way I'm feeling

(Verse)
Head strong and then some
That is why we love so hard
But in the line of fire
We're worlds apart
See the sky is falling
But in my heart that's all I know
With nothing less than worth fighting for

(Bridge)
Walking with a dark cloud over your head
Feeling pain
Best thing might just be to let it rain
Might just be to let it rain

(Pre-Chorus)
Can we go to start?
And start it over you and be
Say yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Tel it from the heart
Well love is unpredictable
Say yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

(Chorus)
Can we go to start? Start over
Can we go to start? Start over
Can we go to start? Start over
Halo as our handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs

(Verse)
La noya des memoria de ti, de mi
Ya no estan, ha sido no pacada 
por la dudas que pusimos en la mesa
Demos marcha atras y regresemos
A gritarnos fuerte, abrazando fuerte, a besarnos fuerte
Sabes que aunque grito yo te amo hasta la muerte
Regresemos a comienzo de ti, de mi

(Pre-Chorus x2)
Can we go to start?
And start it over you and be
Say yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Tel it from the heart
Well love is unpredictable
Say yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Halo as our handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs
