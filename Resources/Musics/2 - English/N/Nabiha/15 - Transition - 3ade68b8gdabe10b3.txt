TRANSITION

(Verse)
Start the car and push it next to me
Getting ready for a new transition
Moving up to a new position
It's time

(Verse)
Leave the past, an innovation
Come with me to gain admission
Wrap it up, we're on a mission
It's time

(Verse)
And I can't help the way that I feel
Open scars, they hope it's so real
People cross in words that they're cool
But I feel

(Pre-Chorus)
Wrap it up and flip it on you
Ready for a new transition
Wrap it up and flip it on you
Are you ready for a new transition?

(Chorus)
Transition, transition
Are you ready for a new transition?
Transition, transition
Are you ready for a new transition?

(Verse)
Grab my heart and push ignition
Ready for a new transition
Look at life with a minor vision
It's time

(Verse)
And I can't help the way that I feel
Open scars, they hope it's so real
People cross in words that they're cool
But I feel

(Pre-Chorus)
Wrap it up and flip it on you
Ready for a new transition
Wrap it up and flip it on you
Are you ready for a new transition?

(Chorus)
Transition, transition
Are you ready for a new transition?
Transition, transition
Are you ready for a new transition?

(Bridge)
Don't let them haters get you down
Just let them fade into the sound

(Pre-Chorus x2)
Wrap it up and flip it on you
Ready for a new transition
Wrap it up and flip it on you
Are you ready for a new transition?

(Chorus)
Transition, transition
Are you ready for a new transition?
Transition, transition
Are you ready for a new transition?
