DEEP SLEEP

(Hey)

Damn wish I was still sleeping.
'Cause most of my dreaming is still in my head.
I was ready to seal it,
so close I could feel it, but I woke up instead.
And now it's too late for me.
I can't go back to sleep.
It's really got me dream stalking.
Should I try a remedy? A new strategy?
Or maybe practise sleep walking?

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't leaving my bed.
I don't wan't to wake up already.
I ain't leaving my bed.
I don't wan't to wake up already.
I'm gonna fall in deeper in deep sleep.
[/Chorus]

Blam who's knocking on my door?
Pounding so raw it's hurting my head.
No! Don't bother calling,
I won't pick up the phone, I'm going back to bed.
And now it's too late for me.
I can't go back to sleep.
It's really got me dream stalking.
And why are you bothering me?
When it's so early.
You'll only catch me sleep talking.

[Chorus]

{Malinese lullaby in french/african}

'Cause I ain't leaving my bed.
I don't wan't to wake up already.
I ain't leaving my bed.
I don't wan't to wake up already.
I ain't leaving my bed.
You got me deeper
'Cause I'm falling deeper deeper
I'm gonna fall on deeper
in deep sleep
