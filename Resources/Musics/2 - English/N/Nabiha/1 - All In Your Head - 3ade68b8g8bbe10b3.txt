ALL IN YOUR HEAD

(Verse)
Whatever you did, whatever you said
Whatever you think, it's all in your head!
All that it's done, it's all in your past
If you don't want to say, I'm not gonna ask

(Pre-Chorus)
When you run away, I just go to pieces
Can we both stay and work it out?
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh!

(Chorus)
It's all in your head, it's all in your head
It's all in your head, it's all in your head
Whatever you did, whatever you said
Whatever it is, it's all in your head
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh

(Verse)
It's never that bad, it's never so wrong
For you to feel like you can't come home
You make a mistake and sometimes we grow
If we never fall down then we'll never know

(Pre-Chorus)
When you run away, I just go to pieces
Can we both stay and work it out?

(Chorus)
It's all in your head, it's all in your head
It's all in your head, it's all in your head
Whatever you did, whatever you said
Whatever it is, it's all in your head
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh

(Bridge)
We all need to clear our minds sometimes
There are things we don't wanna talk about
And I, I'm not judging you on anything
It's alright, it's alright!

(Chorus)
It's all in your head, it's all in your head
It's all in your head, it's all in your head
Whatever you did, whatever you said
Whatever it is, it's all in your head
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh
I know you feel alone-oh-oh-oh
But I'm not gonna go, oh, oh
