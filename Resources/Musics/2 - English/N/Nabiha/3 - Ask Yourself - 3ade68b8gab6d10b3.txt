ASK YOURSELF

I can see that you're hurting right now
And no words can take away the blazing pain
I know you lost the one you thought was the one
But don't bruise yourself and take all the blame
So you loved, you lost, you're broken
Don't you know this one was out of your hands?
Did you fight the pouring rain?
Just ask yourself
Giving more than everything
Just ask yourself
Did you love with arms open
Then you get well
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself
You took the break up
And why it went so wrong
On your shoulders, unbearable
Hey you were never meant to carry it on your own
Like you were
The only one
So you loved you lost, you're broken
don't you know this one was out of your hands?
Did you fight the pouring rain?
Just ask yourself
Giving more than everything
Just ask yourself
Did you love with arms open
Then you get well
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself
Did you face your deepest fears
Give it all or nothing less
Smile through every tear
And did you love with every breath
Did you fight the pouring rain?
Just ask yourself
Giving more than everything
Just ask yourself
Did you love with arms open
Did you get well
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself
