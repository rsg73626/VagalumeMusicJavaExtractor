IF I COULD GET SOME GOOD SLEEP

Here I lay in this bed of snakes
Their cold scales are the only thing I felt
When the news was broke
Through the new year
The venom spread so fast

I had no concept of time
Or how much longer
I'd be able to stay alive
We're all victims
Of emotion, loyalty, and trust
Compromised, for the sake of happiness

In the wake of it all,
You destroyed what took us
So long to build
The walls came down crumbling
And I was left to fend for myself

This is when I found
The only strength I have is within me
This is when I realize my life
Is a series of unfortunate events
And I'm standing in the silhouette

I will smash our memories into oblivion

All the trust and faith I had in you
Your disregard for me and everything
Set fire to this bridge
We move on

Through these rough seas, we will prevail
Through these lonely nights, we will tread on
