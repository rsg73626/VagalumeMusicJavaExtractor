SIX MONTHS & THE SUMMER

You destroyed me and I had to pick up all the
Pieces and become different in order to beat this
Season of heart failure

This is my personal vendetta
This is for months of mental abuse
This is the hell you put me through
I told myself I'd never write this song for you

Two years later and I'm still around
Going strong but still not proud of what I went
Through with you
No one can hold a candle to you

Knowing that you lied,
You're always playing your games
It's time to make this right
So every time you think of me
I hope a piece of you dies
I hope you can't sleep at night
