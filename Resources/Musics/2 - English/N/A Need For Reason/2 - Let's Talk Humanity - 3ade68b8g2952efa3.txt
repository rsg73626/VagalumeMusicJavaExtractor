LET'S TALK HUMANITY

I see the truth in all your lies
I'll expose you for what you really are
Each and every night I lay and behind these
Eyes I see the nightmare of what I'm soon
To be, just another zombie like the rest of them

And they'll say so save me from being just
A number on someone's list.
Can't you see they've been lying to us all?
We're here to tell you that there's more

I refuse your box like society
I refuse your fucking tyranny
Here's an empire ready to collapse

We can argue freedom all day long
But if you let them win we're done
They lie to us all
We are nearing the point of no return,
What have we done? nothing.
