SOUTH OF NOWHERE

I need to get away from this place
Escape the inevitable doom of the human race
I am not you
I won't be bound to this earth

I hate my existence
I hate what we've become, mutants on the run
We have no place to go,
We left our homes in search of hope

We live to die, and now we can't even
Remember what it is that keeps us alive

We choose hate over love
We are such simple creatures
We have no place to go
We left our homes in search of hope

Where is the love we all love to taste?

Every end is a beginning
Every beginning, an end
Human civilization, time to progress
But I am still so proud to say I am not you,
I am nothing like you so step the fuck back
