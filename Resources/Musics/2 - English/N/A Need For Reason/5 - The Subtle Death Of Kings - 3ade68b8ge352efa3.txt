THE SUBTLE DEATH OF KINGS

You are ruler to none
You seek to destroy everything we have become
And the walls we built seem to tear themselves apart
You seek all and any help
Your tyranny needs the spread
Like a virus needs a host

Seek no further, your end has come
In the form of pure justice
For your perverted reign, I will have your head

I am not alone, but they are silent killers
I am not alone and we roam...

This is our means to an end
And we will go down fighting
Until there's none of us left

Now begins the subtle death of kings
You are ruler to none.
