LAST NIGHT

Starless night - lights are fading and I'm waiting
For You to come...
Takin' me to the place long forgotten
Where I will follow You... Starless night...

My last flame is gonna die
With Your cold hand
Now I now - nothing's gonna save me here
I know -I have to understand... Starless night..

Give me a reason...

Give me a reason
I'm begging You for the reason...

Leave me with the black flame of my heart - I just wanna stay
Everyday I want to follow the sun - I just wanna stay
Send me an angel I want to be- I just wanna stay
When he'll come here let me follow him - but i wanna stay

Give me a reason!
