ETERNAL FEAR

I don't see Your face
I can't hear your voice
Why did you leave me
In this horrible world?
I'm not dead I'm not alive

Who am I now, My Lord?
Why don't You show me Your face?
I want to see Your countenance

What is my name now?
I'm different than me before
You have brought me the power
The power of eternity...

I'm called upon to expiate the guilt
I rise to make retributions by kill
on them who killed my primal faith
The immortal beast has been made
