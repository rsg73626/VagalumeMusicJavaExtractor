DREAM

Through the night - sleeping meadows
Every step wakes the shadows
Have to destroy
Thing that killed all Your joy
Evil unites within deep, darkest night

Dreams are fulfilled in Your wandering

Third era - comming
Your time - passing

Now I know I can't stop You
Though things that You're carrying
Are still heavier
Through the night - all alone
Though You know - It can kill You

It's not a dream

Now You can clearly see - all Your dreams are fulfilled
Precious ring of dark desires - burning in the sacred fire

You want to feel it one last time
But it's gone....

Dream fulfilled
