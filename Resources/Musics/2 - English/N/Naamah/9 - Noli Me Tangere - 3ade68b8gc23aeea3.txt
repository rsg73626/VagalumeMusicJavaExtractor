NOLI ME TANGERE

Please never lie again while you're touchin' my skin
Let the senses fall asleep wishin' to forget again

Now i know - two words, that's all...
It's just a game of Yours

Now I'll close my eyes knowing what I want
Nothing realy matters much when You're here so close
Now I know - two words, that's all
It's just a game of yours...

Now I close my eyes
Asking you to lie to me
I smile knowin' that well...

Time - it will never sleep
It won't stop for you - cannot stop for me
But I know that your words are lies
Which I know so well...
