STRANGER

Scream at night
I will sail into your dreams

But let me breathe
I'm so weak
I remember, I forget
I couldn't reach

He's a stranger for all of us
Lookin' into my eyes when dark and light
Surrounded me
Yes, he is called somehow
But I'm sure, he's affraid of me tonight
Becoming wild

I need to find a place
Where You'll look like me
The words unsaid
Time will come - rarely selected part of You
Fading dissapears

Ready to cry, disguised in spite of time
Frightened by mirrors
There wasn't given any choice
To convert devices into distant world
You should be scared out inside
