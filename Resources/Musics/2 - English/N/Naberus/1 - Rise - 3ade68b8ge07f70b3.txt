RISE

Through the mist
Dark muse reigns all
Clouds of gloom constantly fall
Shiftling through this dirt again
Turmoil impends

As this smoke builds around me
The vortex spirals me down

Rise
Break this thrall
Snap the chains
Destroy the mould

Rise
Clear this mind tonight
These thoughts untwine

Fell the power begin it's ascent
End the days of this torment
Free from the chains
Decide your path
Ruin subsides

As this smoke clears around me
The breaking light shines in

Rise
Break this thrall
Snap the chains
Destroy the mould

Rise
Clear this mind tonight
These thoughts untwine

Through
The mist
Darkness falls

The light
Awaits
Hear it's call

Corrupt
The thought
Never free
Forever my reality

Rise, fall
It's all the same
The faded line shall still remain

The shackles gone
Your past erased
Disappear without a trace
