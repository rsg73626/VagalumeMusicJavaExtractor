LANDS OF GRIMNESS AND FROST

Far beyond the blackened horizon,
Far beyond the light.
Where sun no longer rises,
Where lies eternal night.

There is something in those woods,
Living in the dark,
Waiting for our blood,
Waiting for our lifes.
Unholy lands of evil,
Deep inside it's heart,
Created by the thunder,
Created by the spell.

Deep inside the woods,
Deep inside its heart,
There lies the answer,
For quesion of the life,
The meaning of the lies,
The meaning of the pain,
All lies before you...

There is something in those woods,
Living in the dark,
Waiting for our blood,
Waiting for our lifes.
Unholy lands of evil,
Deep inside it's heart,
Created by the thunder,
Created by the spell.

Lands of grimness and frost,
Where i'm forever lost.
Lands of frost,
My soul is lost!

Follow the dark path,
Into the freezing night,
Summon the darkness,
From the blackened sky.

Lands of grimness and frost,
Where i'm forever lost.
Lands of frost,
My soul is lost!

Follow the dark path,
Into the freezing night,
Summon the darkness,
From the blackened sky.
