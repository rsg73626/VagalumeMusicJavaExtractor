GATES OF HELL

Everything around us seems so dark
far away from morning light.
Angels looking for God's mark

Everything now looks so pure
filled with bright hope.
The gates opened before my eyes
and hope in the wind crosses my mind.

REFREN
I was pushed away from light
Far into the freezing night
Like lonely eagle roaming in the sky
If this is heaven, then i wish to die

This eden lost longtime ago
is ready to rise among us all.
When everyone praying for their lives
evil is hiding in Satan's eyes.

REFREN
I was pushed away from light
Far into the freezing night
Like lonely eagle roaming in the sky
If this is heaven, then i wish to die

Falling down into the darkness,
saying hello to the hell.
Where demons are searching the souls,
i've heard the mighty beast's growls.

Now i see there is no turning back
and all souls had deeply collapsed.
I am running away from my life,
for all eternity weeping inside.

REFREN
I was pushed away from light
Far into the freezing night
Like lonely eagle roaming in the sky
If this is heaven, then i wish to die
