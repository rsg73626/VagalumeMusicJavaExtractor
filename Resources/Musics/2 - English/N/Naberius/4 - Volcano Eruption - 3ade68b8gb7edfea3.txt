VOLCANO ERUPTION

Soil is shaking, trambling in fear
smell of sulpur tells you it's near

the vicious force of nature,
awaken after years of sleep


dust and smoke block the sunlight
condemning the landscape to chilling darkness
heat warms up the air
and starts to suffocate the weakest lifeforms


scorching lava with no mercy
burns everything on it's way
vapourising all beings
that don't deserve to live their lives


volcano be the judge
let the unworthy burn
wipe the sin far away
leave none behind

purify your world to gain perfection
obtain it by any cost
destroy the parasites that eat you alive
kill all that can't survive

from this magma will arise
a better, stronger kind
let them breed on the soil
that contains ancestors flesh

let them grow, let them live
let them feast on their blood
if they'll ever be as bad as them
we won't know until you rage again
