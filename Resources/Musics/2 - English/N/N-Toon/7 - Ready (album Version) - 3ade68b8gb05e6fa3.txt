READY (ALBUM VERSION)

Verse 1: Baby I'm checkin' for you,
But I don't wanna rush you into somethin' that you just aint ready for
Cause the moment I saw you
I knew I wanted to call you and ask you baby please could you be my girl
And everyday at school
I'm passin' notes to you
I'm doin' things that I never thought I'd do
And I can't tell a lie
I lay awake at night
And wonder if I have a chance girl to be your guy yeah.

Chorus: I know you're not ready yet to go steady
I know you told me already
But girl I just want you
And my boys told me forget it
But my pride won't let it
Cause girl I'm feelin' you

I know you're not ready yet to go steady
I know you told me already
But girl I just want you
And my boys told me forget it
But my pride won't let it
Cause girl I'm feelin' you

Verse 2: Baby I don't mind waitin'
Baby anticipatin'
about that day when you say that you will be mine
Pretty soon we'll be datin'
Everyone will be hatin'
on a love that can stand through the test of time
If you give me a chance
I'll take you by the hand(the hand)
And tell you all the reasons why I should be your man
But first I gotta know(first I gotta know)
Girl do you wanna roll(girl do you wanna roll)
We don't have to tell a soul keep it on the low

Chorus: I know your not ready yet to go steady
I know you told me already(I know you're not)
But girl I just want you
And my boys told me forget it(they told me)
But my pride won't let it
Cause girl I'm feelin' you

I know your not ready yet to go steady
I know you told me already(told me)
But girl I just want you(I just want you)
And my boys told me forget it
But my pride won't let it
Cause girl I'm feelin' you

Bridge: Girl you are my everything
I swear this much is true(swear this much is true)
You'll never have to be alone cause I'll be next to you(mmmm)
I'm givin' you my all(I'm givin' you my all yeah)
Cause girl you are the bomb(oooooohh)
And I won't stop chasin' you
Cause girl you are the one(you're the one- Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)

Chorus: I know you're not ready yet to go steady
