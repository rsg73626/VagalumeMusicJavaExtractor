LISA LISA

Met this girl named Lisa on the 1st day of school
Didn't have much to say because I was being cool
Had this funny feeling all day long
That she's the only one for me, I gotta put it on

Should I just sing to her
I would really love to have your phone number
Or should I just forget and walk away from her
I wonder if she knows that I could be her love
Or am I not enough

Lisa Lisa
I'm in love with you
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do
Lisa Lisa
I've been so confused
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do

I wanna be the one she's calling everyday after school
We'll stay on the phone till it gets late and break the rules
I guess I could just tell her, but would it sound right
Telling her I dream about her each and every night

Or should I just sing to her
I would really love to have your phone number
Or should I just forget and walk away from her
I wonder if she knows that I could be her love
Or am I not enough

Lisa Lisa
I'm in love with you
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do
Lisa Lisa
I've been so confused
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do

Lisa Lisa
I'm in love with you
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do
Lisa Lisa
I've been so confused
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do

Oh Lisa, oh Lisa Lisa, oh Lisa, oh Lisa Lisa, oh Lisa,
oh Lisa, oh Lisa, oh Lisa

Lisa Lisa
I'm in love with you
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do
Lisa Lisa
I've been so confused
And I don't know what I guy is supposed to do
