DO YOU BELIEVE

man there's this girl
what girl man?
this girl i like, and whenever i'm around her
she makes me feel i don't know, different
why don't you just tell her how you feel?
coz i'm afraid she won't believe me
lord man you just gotta convince her
i don't know, but i gotta make her believe me

i don't know what to say to convince you
i've been walking on air since i met you
my head is spinning around
could this be love that i have found?
everything i have i want to share with you
and i give up nintendo just to talk to you
i know that she sees me
but i wonder if i told her would she believe me 
do you believe that i will love you always?
do you believe?
do you believe?
do you believe that i will love you always?
do you believe?
do you believe?
do you
do you believe?

if you believe there is one true love for you
i'm that one for you
girl i adore you
and i'm saving my lips for you to be my very first kiss
girl there's nothing in this world i wouldn't do for you
you're as sweet as cotton candy, hershey kisses too
and although she doesn't need me,
what you wanna bet i'll get her to believe me?
do you believe that i will love you always?
do you believe?
do you believe?
do you believe that i will love you always?
do you believe?
do you believe?
do you believe?
do you believe?
do you believe?
how can i make you believe?
do i have to get down, do i have to get down on my knees?
i bet you you could fall in love with me.
