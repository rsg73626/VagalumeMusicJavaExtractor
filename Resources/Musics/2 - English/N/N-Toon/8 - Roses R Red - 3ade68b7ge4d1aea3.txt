ROSES R RED

Just to know that I will see you today
Makes me wake up early just to see your face
Makes that bus ride to school seem A-okay
Girl, i've never felt this way
I've never been in love to know just how it feels
And everytime I see you girl my heart beats are real
So if roses are real and violets are blue
Gilr what i'm trying to say
I think that i'm in love with you

Roses are red
Violets are blue girl
I'm not sure but I think i'm in love with you
With you that's right that's right
I'm not really sure but I think i'm in love with you

It's kind of strange to me
Now I know what to say
But till see your face
And then my mind just goes blank
the butterflies then come
And then my knees get weak
Girl I can hardly speak
As crazy as it seems
I don't want school to end
So that I can stare at you and try to pretend
So if roses are red and violets are blue
Girl what I am tryin to say
I think that i'm in love with you

Roses are red
Violets are blue girl
I'm not sure but I think i'm in love with you
With you that's right that's right
I'm not really sure but I think i'm in love with you

And everytime I see you girl my heartbeats are real
So if roses are red and violets are blue
Girl what I am trying to say
I think that i'm in love with you

Roses are red
Violets are blue girl
I'm not sure but I think i'm in love with you
With you that's right that's right
I'm not really sure but I think i'm in love with you
