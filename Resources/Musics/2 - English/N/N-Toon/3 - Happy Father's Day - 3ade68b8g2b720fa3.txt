HAPPY FATHER'S DAY

Verse 1: (Lloyd)
Dad I'm sending you this letter to let you know
I've been thinking 'bout you
All the kids at school are ready for the holidays
That's when I really miss you
If it's not too much to ask
Could you call me or write me back
There's a special day I'm celebrating
And hoping you'd come back

Chorus:
Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day
I miss you daddy
I love you badly
I still have faith in you

Verse 2: (Sammie)
Dad I'd make you proud of me
If you can see me but I understand
Mama's doing the best she can
But it's hard for a woman raising a man
(Justin)
And I'm not asking any blame
Because I know in life things change
And if we never get together
I'm still proud to have your name

Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day
I miss you daddy
I love you badly
I still have faith in you

Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day
I miss you daddy
I love you badly
I still have faith in you

Verse 3: (Lloyd)
There's a lot of thigns I don't understand
But I wonder if I did something wrong
And even though mom assures me it's not that way
Am I the reason you're gone
If it's not too much to ask
(Chuckie)
Could you call me or write me back
(Lloyd)
There's a special day I'm celebrating
And hoping you'd come back
(Hoping you'd come back)
OOOOHHHHHHHHH OOOHHHHHHHHHHH OOOOHHHHHHHHH

Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day to you
Happy Father's Day
I miss you daddy
I love you badly
I still have faith in you

Talking: (Justin)
I ain't mad at 'cha
Man, I wait every birthday,
every Christmas, every summer,
for the phone to ring.
Everybody makes mistakes,
but it's never too late
(Everett)
Daddy I'll always hold the door open
hoping one day you'll walk through
(Lloyd)
See, my dad died when I was just a baby
I know he's watching over me, but I still
miss not being able to share some things
with him. Remember you don't have to be a
biological parent just to share your love and
guidance with someone who really needs it and
dad I'll always love you.
(Chuckie)
I love you daddy
(Justin)
Dad I'm still waiting
