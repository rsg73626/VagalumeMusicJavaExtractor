READY

Baby, I'll take it for you, but I don't wanna rush it
There's somethin' that you touched I ain't ready for
¡®Cause the moment I saw you I knew I wanted to call
you
And ask you, "Baby, please just be my girl"

And every day at school I'm passin' notes to you
I'm doin' things that I never thought I'll do
And I can't tell a lie, I lay awake at night
And wonder if I have a chance, girl

I know you're not ready until you're steady
I know you told me already
But girl, I just want you
And my boys told me, "Forget it"
But my pride won't let it
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you

I know you're not ready until you're steady
I know you told me already
But girl, I just want you
And my boys told me, "Forget it"
But my pride won't let it
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you

Baby, I don't mind waitin', baby, anticipatin'
About the day when you say that you will be mine
Pretty soon we'll be datin', everyone will be hatin'
On a love that could stand through the test of time

If you give me a chance, I'll take you by the hand
And tell you all the reasons why I have to be your man
But first I gotta know, girl, do you wanna roll
We don't have to tell a soul, keep it on the low

I know you're not ready until you're steady
I know you told me already
But girl, I just want you
And my boys told me, "Forget it"
But my pride won't let it
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you

I know you're not ready until you're steady
I know you told me already (Told me)
But girl, I just want you (Just want you)
And my boys told me, "Forget it,"
But my pride won't let it
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you

Girl, you are my everything, I swear this much is true
You'll never have to be alone ¡®cause I'll be next to
you, mmm, hmm
I'm givin' you my all {I'm givin' you my all} ¡®cause
girl, you are the bomb {Ho...oh...}
And I won't stop chasing you ¡®cause girl, you are the
one {Ho...oh...oh...}

I know you're not ready until you're steady
I know you told me already
But girl, I just want you (I just want you)
And my boys told me, "Forget it"
But my pride won't let it (Won't let it)
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you (I'm really feelin' you,
baby)

I know you're not ready until you're steady (I know
you told me already)
I know you told me already
But girl, I just want you (I just want you)
And my boys told me, "Forget it"
But my pride won't let it
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you

I know you're not ready until you're steady (I know
you're not ready)
I know you told me already (Ready to go steady)
But girl, I just want you (I just want you)
And my boys told me, "Forget it"
But my pride won't let it
¡®Cause girl, I'm feelin' you

I know you're not ready until you're steady
I know you told me already
But girl, I just want you
