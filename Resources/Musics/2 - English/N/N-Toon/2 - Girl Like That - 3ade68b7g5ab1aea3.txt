GIRL LIKE THAT

See her everyday about noon
in the lunchroom
chillin at the table with her friends
they don't act cool
she never gives me the time of day
says I'm cute but
I'm only in the seventh grade
But I love her

All night
can't sleep
wonder if she notice me
scary
to be
into someone you can't see
she's got everything
a guy could want
this girl's too deep
it's alright
with me
if we could talk sometime

She's so fly
better than singing
she's on my mind
just can't shake it
got to find
gotta get up wit a girl like that
girl like that
she's so fly
better than singing
she's on my mind
just can't shake it
got to find
gotta get up wit a girl like
gotta get a girl like that

Maybe I should ask her for a date
to the movies
then we could stay on the phone real late
on the weekends
never met a girl I thought was straight
like my best friend
trippin nintendo all the way
she's the greatest

All night
can't sleep
wonder if she notice me
scary
to be
into someone you can't see
she's got everything
a guy could want
this girl's too deep
it's alright
with me
if we could talk sometime

She's so fly
better than singing
she's on my mind
just can't shake it
got to find
gotta get up wit a girl like that
girl like that
she's so fly
better than singing
she's on my mind
just can't shake it
got to find
gotta get up wit a girl like
gotta get a girl like that
