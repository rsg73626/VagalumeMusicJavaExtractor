NOW YOU'RE ALL ALONE

Girl you say that I have always been the one
You always wanna but you never let me know
You've seen my video, i'm on the radio
And now it's all about me
But when I step to you
You step away from me
Remeber how you played

Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Now you tell your friends that you know me
Say that we talk frequently
Now you all up in my songs
Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Girl i'm still tht same guy that you think is a star
And now you're all alone

It's funny how you change
Now you wanna step to me
But I ain't the one
You had your chance to be with me
So I gotta let you know, hear me on the radio
Or see me on your tv
Cuz when I stepped to you
You stepped away from me
Now you're the one who's lonely

Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Now you tell your friends that you know me
Say that we talk frequently
Now you all up in my songs
Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Girl i'm still tht same guy that you think is a star
And now you're all alone

Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Now you tell your friends that you know me
Say that we talk frequently
Now you all up in my songs
Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Girl i'm still tht same guy that you think is a star
And now you're all alone

Bridge
Girl, how could you let me slip right through your fingertips
Girl, you couldv'e had everything with me, everytying you need
But girl, now it's to late to get back, yo shouldv'e thought of that
When you had a chance, I could've been your man

Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Now you tell your friends that you know me
Say that we talk frequently
Now you all up in my songs
Girl you said you wasn't feelin me
You were never callin me
Never used to ring my phone
Girl i'm still tht same guy that you think is a star
And now you're all alone
