CAN'T

Summertime
I'm still thinking 'bout you
If I don't
Love then what will I do
Reality's
Here but not coming through

In my mind
I can be what we choose
But in life
We can't stand in those shoes
It's something I knew
Before our debut

We can't be together
I don't think I care
As long as I can think about you

In my head forever
I will not forget
Said I'll Always think about you

We can't be together
I don't think I care
As long as I can think about you

In my head forever
I will not forget
Said I'll Always think about you


Maybe I'm
Not as real as I think
In daytime my
Mind and heart ain't in sync
But at night
I only sleep through my blinks

Struggling
To know what's going on
Overthinking
I hope that is my song
Cuz if it is
I could play out the wrongs

We can't be together
I don't think I care
As long as I can think about you

In my head forever
I will not forget
Said I'll Always think about you

We can't be together
I don't think I care
As long as I can think about you

In my head forever
I will not forget
Said I'll Always think about you
