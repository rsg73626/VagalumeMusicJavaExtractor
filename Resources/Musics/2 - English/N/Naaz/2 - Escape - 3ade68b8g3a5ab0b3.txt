ESCAPE

I told you no other lies no more
So I could fall asleep to escape
How I've fallen deep
I don't listen to hearts no more
They say I'm so naive
I can't say no more I gotta leave

No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I said I gotta leave
Oh I gotta leave now

Escape now
I don't wanna live in misery now
No more, no more, no more
Escape now
All the way to my fantasy now
No more, no more, no more
Escape
Escape

I don't look at myself no more
Cause I'm so ashamed of my thoughts
Can not keep them tamed
The days are feeling longer now
That is why I hide the mornings
Feels harder than the nights

No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I said I gotta leave
Oh I gotta leave now

Escape now
I don't wanna live in misery now
No more, no more, no more
Escape now
All the way to my fantasy now
No more, no more, no more
Escape
Escape
Escape
