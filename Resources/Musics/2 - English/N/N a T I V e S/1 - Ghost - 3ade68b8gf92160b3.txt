GHOST

How many times
Do I have to tell you twice
Until you realize
You've almost crossed the line
My patience is thin
From all these lies I've taken in
But thanks for everything
You really helped me out again

And now I'm better than I've ever been
Better than I've ever been
I'm feeling my heart beating
Running away from what I once knew
I'm taking it all with me
I'm feeling my heart beating
Turning away from the ghost of you
I'm taking it all with me

But I couldn't find
Anything you left behind
And then I realized
That it was me who crossed the line
And I know you
That if anything I do
Every path you've walked
I knew you would before you did
You left a trail behind

And now I'm better than I've ever been
Better than I've ever been
I feel my heart beating
It's good to be back on the ground
It's good to be back on the ground

Cause I'll be seeing you around
I feel my heart beating
And now I'm better than I've ever been
Better than I've ever been
