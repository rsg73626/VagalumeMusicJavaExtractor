DON'T DON'T DO IT! (FEAT. KENDRICK LAMAR)

It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
Gonna up and up this life
Til' we go down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
Gonna up and up this life
Til the lid gets stuffed
Lifting up, lifting up
Lifting up, lifting up
Coming down, coming down
Coming down, coming down
Wake them up, wake them up
To the sound

They tell you pull over, tell you get out your car
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
They wanna see your legs hooked up to your arms
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it

We were going home
Waiting for the kids
Schoolbus to arrive
They're gonna do it anway
Where'd you put the keys?
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a Tbi
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?
I'm not your guy
They're gonna do it anway
Look behind the trees
Tryna to tell you don't
They're about to fire

They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway

They tell you pull over, tell you get out your car
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
They wanna see your legs hooked up to your arms
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it

Whoa Ferguson, Oh Baltimore
Raleigh, North Carolina
They're gonna do it anway
Wisconsin, Tulsa, Oklahoma
Cleveland, Ohio
Montgomery, Baton Rouge, Cincinnati car
Dayton, Ohio
They're gonna do it anway
New Jersey, Phoenix, Minnesota
South Carolina
They gonna do it anway

They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway

You better Duckworth fast for the millennia'
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brakes free, press gas when he enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man can't find escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you, raise your hand up, then he shoot ya'
Face off, face up Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same block
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stand clear of the prognosis
Problem hoping, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Roller coast ride that bitch
Soon the lady's eyes gon' switch
You know Cali got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, break, fast!

Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
