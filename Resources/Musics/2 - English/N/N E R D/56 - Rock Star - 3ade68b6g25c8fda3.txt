ROCK STAR

Fuckin' posers
It's almost over now
It's almost over now
Yeah

You think the way you live is okay
You think posin'
Will save your the day
You think we don't see 
That you're running
Better call your boys 
‘Cause I'm coming

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far

It's almost over now
It's almost over now

Guess that
You ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
Will you see the mantle or you will see the skies

It's almost over now
It's almost over now

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit

It's almost over now
Almost over now

Something's on your chest 
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since

It's almost over now
Almost over now

You have to plenty of time
There was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wait
I'm standing there

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far

It's almost over now
It's almost over now

You don't succeed cause you hesitate
You think we're fly
But we levitate
Just be yourself
Don't ask us why
‘Cause if you don't we'll make you fly

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far

It's almost over now
It's almost over now
