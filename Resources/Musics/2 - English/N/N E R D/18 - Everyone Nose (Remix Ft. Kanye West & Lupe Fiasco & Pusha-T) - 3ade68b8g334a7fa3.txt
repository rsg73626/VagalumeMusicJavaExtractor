EVERYONE NOSE (REMIX FT. KANYE WEST & LUPE FIASCO & PUSHA-T)

Everyone Nose (Remix)

(Kanye)
Hey, Do you have any black inside you/
Would you like some, like some?/
You know you got a right to/ do whatever you like to/
don c, we got the right one, the right one/ in the
club, always the flyest/ always got her hands the
highest/ she stopped drinking diet coke, she on that
coke diet/ she bat she bat her eyelids/ that girl is
so wired/ I know she so tired/ but oooh she on fire/
hundred dollar bill, look at you look at you/ a
hundred dollar bills, this ain't new this ain't new/
from that paris, lindsey, britney, mary-kate, and
whitney/ people say that they clean, motherfucker
don't bullshit me/

(Chorus)
All the girls standing in line for the bathroom (2x)
All the girls standing in the, all the girls standing
in the
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

(Pharrel)
You left yo nigga home, you said you at your sisters/
You and your girlfriends wrong, you in here taking
pictures/
You ain't gotta tell us you spending daddy's cash/
Your girlfriends jealous, you got the fattest ass/
One down to p, one trying to leave/
It's hot as fuck but you dying just to ski/
It's clear as black and white, like a fat panda/
Your brain is magic city, your nose is atlanta/
I said think about your future, you can't do that
tomorrow/
But you don't hear a word, you see that SLR/ you
like,"hey, pharrel, I ain't trying to kill your mood/
but I can do the star trak sign, see, killer dude."/

Chorus

(Lupe Fiasco)
Now she got high hopes, just to say hi to us/
She want the high life, she like them higher ups/
She know we high rolling, she know it's high stakes/
That's why she high-speeding out on that highway/
She say she high maintenance, she say she high
fashion/
She say high priced, I think she high cappin/
She had her high heels, I had my high tops/
Sippin a hi-C, eatin on high drops/
I asked her high it feel up on this high rise/
She said this high score, this was the high life/
She got her hiPod, bumpin her hiTunes/ This higher
education, welcome to high school/

Chorus

(Pusha T)
I got a crown made of powder, everybody knows who's
the king of the coke flow be/ all I hear is oh ki,
every line is oh ki/ all you rappers okey dokey/
nigga, you don't paint pictures/ I paint mirechois on
you niggas/ and dime yay speedy bag bitches/ buy and
sell, I can accomodate your clientel/ shamu weight,
motherfucker, brace your scales/ p to the usha, with a
name like that what you look for?/
More less like p with the hook up, hit me on the bat
phone if you want it cooked up/ ride with me, as I'm
switchin lane to lane/ in my play clothes as I'm
grippin grain/ in a hail of bullets how I write my
name/ whether soft or hard, motherfucker, caine is
caine/

Chorus repeats as song fades out
