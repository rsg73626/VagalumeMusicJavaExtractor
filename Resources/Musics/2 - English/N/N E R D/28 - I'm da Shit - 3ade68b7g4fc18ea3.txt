I'M DA SHIT

See sometimes you gotta realize where you are in your life 
In order to feel good
And I feel good baby 
Listen to me

Verse 1

Walk in the club with a bunch of thugs
Modify your brains
So they call me drugs 
See a hundred girls
Get a thousand hugs
One’s in my ear talking bout her tub
She likes me
She says she needs me
She says she wants me
‘Cause I’m da shit

She says she likes me
She says she needs me
She wants to see me
‘Cause I’m da shit

Chorus

Now it seems that things are really getting better 
In my life
Is it just today or things are really getting better 
We’ll see tonight 
We’ll see tonight 

Hey little girl with the tattoo thigh
Baby you look like a slice of pie
Hope my style don’t cause you fear
Matter of fact baby where you going from here

Kiss on me baby
Lick on me baby
But you can’t own me baby 
‘Cause I’m da shit
Kiss on me baby
Lick on me baby
But you can’t own me baby 
‘Cause I’m da shit

Chorus

Check it out now
Don’t look at me like what is up
Said I was a nerd 
But I ain’t a punk
If you talk shit 
Be prepare to thump
Plus Terrors 4/4 is prepared to dump
Watch out boy
Get back there 
Watch how you actin’
‘Cause I’m da shit
I’m tellin’ you watch it now
Tell your boys to get back there, 
Watch how ya’ll actin’
‘Cause we da shit

Chorus

How do you feel?
I feel good 
How do you feel?
I feel good 
How do you feel?
I feel good 
How do you feel?
I feel good.
