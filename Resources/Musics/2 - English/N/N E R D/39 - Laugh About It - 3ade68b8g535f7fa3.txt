LAUGH ABOUT IT

Girls on the floor

You made me take a look at me
At all the flaws and what could be
And all the things that you would reap
Was hidden in me I didnt wanna see that was troublin me

Am I your sledge hammer
Coming down with the boom
I mean I feel in love, cuz im inside of you
I mean I love your heart, but your mind if I had to choose
Smilin at me smokin but you are not amused

Chorus x2

Someday ill laugh about it
All that preciousness we had it
Couldnt it last like that I doubt it
Come on girl lets laugh about it

The way you see the world neat
Your in sun and clouds n peaks
Please be my friend oh would you please
But you still wanna mood smoke comin out your shoes
Mean while im still blue

Am I your sledge hammer
Coming down with the boom
I mean I feel in love, cuz im inside of you
I mean I love your heart, but your mind if I had to choose
Smilin at me smokin but you are not amused

Chorus

Someday ill laugh about it
All that preciousness we had it
Couldnt it last like that I doubt it
Come on girl lets laugh about it

Lets just have a blast about it(ohh some day)
Never found our paths without it (laugh about it)
All the bullshit that surrounds it (ohh some day)
Lets just have a laugh about it (laugh about it)

And I could never lose those memories
Because your screamin from the clouds goin out
The color from those painted these melodies
Infact im dreamin about it now, uhh

Chorus

Someday ill laugh about it (ohh someday)
All that preciousness we had it (laugh about it)
Couldnt it last like that I doubt it (ohh someday)
Come on girl lets laugh about it (laugh about it)
