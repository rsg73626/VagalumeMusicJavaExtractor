[Verse 1]
Kay, what’s this on your iPod
Tell me what you listening to
Why you jumping bout his money
I aint hear him mention you
I know this aggravates you
And it upsets you
But I change you
I know how you hear me is this better
Yeah girl you like this
Yeah this your language
Life is short in black and white
Just like little penguins
Why you in Social Studies
Screaming and arguing
Why you Dr. Killjoy
Shooting up the party
Where you get that money from
Wait where you running to
Why I hearing sirens
Where them blue lights coming to
Dog you’re a genius
You can blueprint and plan this
Instead of playing videogames
Why don’t you take advantage

[Chorus]
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)
You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk b*tch!)
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)
You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk b*tch!)
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)
You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk *****!)
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)
You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk b*tch!)

Riding in your mama car booming like a motherf***er

I know you’re a light
And there’s a lamp to let inside
It’s not just burning bright
It won’t blow up in your face if you try

I know you try hard
But you gotta try harder
Now you got your light to find your way
You’re a multitasker
You’re doing things faster
Are you going to let this guy [?give in your decay?]
[Chorus]
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)
You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk b*tch!)
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)

You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk b*tch!)
You so anti don’t I matter (what!)
You so you so anti don’t I matter (You punk b*tch!)

Motherf***er are you A.D.H.D. A.D.H.D. A.D.H.D.
