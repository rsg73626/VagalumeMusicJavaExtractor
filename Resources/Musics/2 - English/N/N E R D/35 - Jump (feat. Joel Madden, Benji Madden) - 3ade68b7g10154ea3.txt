JUMP (FEAT. JOEL MADDEN, BENJI MADDEN)

Hello
Hey Mom, It'S Me Mom
Can'T Tell You Where I Sleep Mom
'Cause That'S Where We Be Mom
Sometimes I Steal And Cheat Mom
Yes I Get Enough To Eat Mom
Mom, Can You Listen To Me, No
I Don'T Mess With Guns
Yes, In My Travels I Have Seen One
No, Being Around The Weed Is No Fun
But House Rules Sure Were No Fun
Something Told Me To 
Jump... (And I Don'T Care Now)
Jump... (Cause We Don'T Care Now)
Jump... (I Packed My Things Now)
Jump... (This Shit Right Now, I'Ll Check It Out)

Hey Dad, Ok Dad
That'S What You Say Dad, I Never Could Obey Dad
You Would Have Bad Days Dad
And You Would Make Me Pay Dad
Make Me Feel Wasted
Punk Rock Tattoos, Letter Jacket
Good Grades Don'T Come With That Package
Yes, Sure I Would Love To Match It
But Names Just Make It Harder To Hack It, Bye

Jump... (Cause We Don'T Care Now)

Jump... (This Shit Right Now, I'Ll Check It Out)

Don'T Let Your Teachers Teach You About Wealth 
To Death, Maybe There'S Something Else
(I'Ll Check It Out)
Don'T Let Nasa Teach You That We Are By Ourselves
'Cause Trust Me There'S Something Else
(I'Ll Check It Out)

La, La...
Maybe There'S Something Else
(I'Ll Check It Out)
See, We'Re Not Part Of The Magna Charta
There'S No Shuttle For Us To Charter, No
They Keeping It For Themselves
(I'Ll Check It Out)

Let My Ex-Girlfriend I'M Trying
And Her New Boyfriend I'D Fight Him
And What About My Cousins
Tell 'Em That I Love Them
I'M Not Perfect, Nor Facetious
But At Home I Feel Seatless
Your Sun Completely Heatless
Turn To Bbc, You Should See This
A Thousand Kids

Jump... (And I Don'T Care Now)

Woke Up, Begins Someday
Wish I Had It On The Way
Though I Am A Rebel, Some Would Say
No One'S Home, It'S Heaven
