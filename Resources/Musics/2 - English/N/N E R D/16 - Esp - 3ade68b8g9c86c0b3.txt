You got so much time, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much space, but you ain't gonna use it
You got a great big mind, but you ain't gonna use it
You got synergy, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much light, but you ain't gonna use it
You got such good taste, but you ain't tryna use it
Other side to your brain, but you ain't tryna to use it
You got an extra eye, but you ain't tryna to use it
Remember what you find comes from the losing

Walking around with the energy of the hot summers
Spread to go weird, illuminated creatures
The evil incarnates, they wanna take it from us
But, I walk with a force that can penetrate the police
Hey, workers of mass destruction
Influence your patterns
The energy of a thousand suns
The energy in everyone

You know that you got it right when people ask, "Hey, what are you on? "

Did you ever realize that the universe just means one song

Lay back, lay back, lay back
Forth forth forth, forth
Lay back, lay back, lay back
Forth forth forth, forth
Lay back, lay back, lay back
Forth forth forth, forth (I said come on man!)
Lay back, lay back, lay back
