THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER

Check it out bitch 
See sometimes 
You gotta realize 
Where you are in your life 
In order to feel good and I feel good baby 
Listen to me 

Walk in the club wit a bunch of thugs 
Modify ya brains so they call me drugs 
See a hundred girls, get a thousand hugs 
One's in my ear talking bout her tub 
She likes me 
She say she needs me 
Say she wants me 
Cause I'm the shit 
Said she likes me 
She said she needs me 
She wants to see me 
Cause I'm the shit 

Now it seems that things are really getting better 
In my life 
Is it just today or things are really getting better 
We'll see tonight 
We'll see tonight 

Hey little girl wit the tattoo thigh 
Baby you look like a slice of pie 
Hope my style don't cause you fear 
Matter of fact baby, where you goin' from here? 
Kiss on me baby 
Lick on me baby 
But you can't own me baby 
Cause I'm the shit 
Kiss on me baby 
Lick on me baby 
But you can't own me baby 
Cause I'm the shit

Now it seems that things are really getting better 
In my life 
Is it just today or things are really getting better 
We'll see tonight 
We'll see tonight 

Check it out now 
Don't look at me like "What is up?" 
Said I was a nerd but I ain't a punk 
If you talk shit be prepared to thump 
Plus Terrar's 4 4 is prepared to dump 
Watch out boy 
Get back then 
Watch how you're acting 
Cause I'm the shit 
I'm telling you watch out now 
Tell ya boys to get back then 
Watch how ya'll acting 
Cause we the shit 

[4x]
Now it seems that things are really getting better 
In my life 
Is it just today or things are really getting better 
We'll see tonight 
We'll see tonight 

[3x]
How do you feel? 
I feel good 
[4x]
Girl, girl, girl
