KITES (FEAT. KENDRICK LAMAR, M.I.A.)

Pt. I

Yeah
On my young niggas, on my done nigga
Woo!
Yeah
On my young one, on my dead one
One time!
Woo!

Ay, oh-ay, ay-ay-ah
Ay, oh-ay, ay-ay-ah
Ay, oh-ay, ay-ay-ah
Ay, oh-ay, ay-ay-ah
Ay, location [?]
Ay, my love is [?]
Ay, [?] kites
Ay, [?]

We in love with the rally, but they had to have the clothes
Tonight we unified society, all my sisters and my bros
Guess the wind, they gon' shoot us
Depending on which way it blows
In the moon like Apollos
Kites like Ufos
Nigga hold a gun (hold a gun, hold a gun, hold a gun)
What you tryna' cover for? (cover for, cover for, cover for)
Nigga hold a gun (hold a gun, hold a gun, hold a gun)
There's room for some many more (many more, many more, many more)

Pt. Ii

Hold up in the morning, don't know if you're gonna blah!
When we do the [?] til' it's done
Everybody needs friends, okay
[?] you know you need to blah!
If you want to shine way up!
If you want to shine way up!
Way, way, way up!
If you want to bring [?] up

Kites on my radar, life in my palms
[?] chaos
Tell them to a [?]
Must [?] with a granny from Ar's (room for the [?] )
The day I have a J. R., I tell them [?] (fuck the bullshit)
Radio never play ours
This revolution ain't televised with prayers
Children play in a war
And a ruler with restrictions
And the police [?]
Ain't no sentence for our sentences
Ain't no killers for our killers
Every prosecution haunts us, save the verdict for the lawyers
Illuminate the chorus [?] scream back at me in the morning
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California
The devil is alive, it's the time to be anointed
[?] turned a record to a dream
More pussy, [?] even if I gotta bleed
Sitting and waiting for a universal pain
Had the ticket for the nation, this is as big as you and me
I let you see my contacts, okay
Tryna send end off into combat, okay!
Working up the [?] for every human being
If you are [?]
Me, I am way up

Way, way, way up
Hey, hey
Bring the fucking [?]
Hey, hey

The girls in here are the humblest
We drink out of plastic tumblers
While you see us on Tumblr's
We wave at each other [?]
They don't wanna go down with foreigners
Say "hey, you", you won't admire us
[?], they curious
I wanna get high cause I'm curious
I'm serious, I hope you are feeling us
[?] I'm paying all these with [?]
With mobiles of [?] that are delirious
It's our dream, it's out of radius
I'm letting off kites over barriers

I'm letting off kites over barriers
I'm letting off kites over barriers
I'm letting off kites over barriers
I'm letting off kites over barriers

Pt. II

They give us so much more
Hey!
