SPAZ

[Verse 1: Pharrell]

Hey...

I'm a little teapot short and stout
Theres some shake-up'in around me know it's talk, and no doubt
I pop the lid the lid, its gon be me I wanna know
Nothing'll happen if I don't open my mouth
I aint a punk bitch, I don't give a f**k
I'm just bein me and speakin from the gut

Well its a little bit of us, a whole lot of you,
and we just came here to see what it do...


[Chorus]

I'm right here, and I aint goin nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I aint goin nowhere
You can knock doors and tear up, ya'have to air so...

Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to


[Verse 2: Shay]

I'm a little teapot blowin off steam
You put me on the heat, I don't whistle I scream
Bang, bang, f**k a bed f**k a dream
This is rage blowin up your machine
I'm a star bitch, I don't give a f**k
Don't be surprised when this bitch start blowin up

Well its a little bit of us, a whole lot of you,
and we just came here to see what it do...


(Chorus)


[Pharrell]

And now I'm wakin up layin in the ambulance bed
with somethin in my arm, I gotta get it off
A tattoo with a line that'll read your mind
And next is your mind, I gotta get it off
The shit they spray attack my lungs everyday
With a creeping decay, I gotta get it off
By attacking these things, I earnt my wings
And my halo but first I gotta, get it off


(Chorus x2)
