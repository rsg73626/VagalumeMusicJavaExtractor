INSIDE OF CLOUDS (TYLER, THE CREATOR REMIX)

[Tyler, The Creator]
Drip drop, the angels made a pit stop
Pissing on the demons of the earth
What's it really worth? (shit)
Now its fucking pouring (ugh)
Wanted to go skate (can't)
Now my day is boring (damn)
Snoring in the bed with blankets cause my head spin
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrin
It's a rainy day, so I skipped the Led Zeppelin
To play some Sade; Love Deluxe through my headset
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella (why?)
Cause I really didn't want to get my shit wet
Run through the puddles, playing in the mud, Fun
It sucks that I'm too tall for the tub
Or I would get my toys, and make a lot of noise
While my mom is in the kitchen cooking up a meal
Fireplace is starting up, dick is barely warming up
Sippy cup full of whip cream, hot chocolate

[Pharrell]
I can smell it when I go outside (outside)
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet (outside)
That's what rains for

All the kids see rain and scream no no
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my sailboat that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes?
Did it go or did something shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the one though
The rain gives life cause it is amazing

[Tyler, The Creator]
Lightning is striking
Water hitting on my window like Ike
I am not Tina buddy do not give my window pane (pain)
Light bulbs while I'm wearing that wig and flying kites
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking
On a fucking mountain where the water fountains icing
Stand there in a tank top, prop that's from Baywatch
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream
Get sick and then I won't have to
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after
Sit in bed write a bunch of raps up....(ugggh)
Then I won't be lying when I say that I'm a sick rapper
I might fail so I won't bother
The sun is playing hide and seek like my fucking father
The only difference is that it comes back in full effect
In the summer heats up, the thermometer's erecting

[Pharrell]
The inside of clouds (the inside of clouds)
It's the window into the sky
Proves there's life
