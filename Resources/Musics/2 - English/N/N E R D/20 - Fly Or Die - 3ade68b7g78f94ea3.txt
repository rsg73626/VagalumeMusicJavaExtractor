FLY OR DIE

Mummy, 
Daddy, 
I know, 
You love me, 
Bad grades, 
Playstation, 
Restriction, 
You took it from me, 
Well God forbid, 
Something goes wrong, 
You call, 
The police, 
Well guess what, 
I found, 
In the drawer of daddy's 

Oh God (Oh God) 
Oh God (Oh God) 
Oh God (Oh God) 

Hey! 

It won't be long, 
Till you see me on the news! 
Another soul lost at sea, 
Were taking a cruise! 
Gasping for air makes the righteous path, 
Harder to choose. 
Well its either fly or die, 
Sink or swim, 
Which one shall I choose!? 

Stupid shrink 
Get paid, 
By the hour, 
350. 
He can't, Figure out, 
Whats wrong, 
With me. 
Dumba$$, 
Girlfriend, 
Fcuked my friend, She's a hoe. 
Try tellin, 
Mumm and dad, 
But there more concerned with the portfolio. 

Oh God (Oh God) 
Oh God (Oh God) 
Oh God (Oh God) 

Hey! 

It won't be long, 
Till you see me on the news! 
Another soul lost at sea, 
Were taking a cruise! 
Gasping for air makes the righteous path, 
Harder to choose. 
Well its either fly or die, 
Sink or swim, 
Which one shall I choose!? 

Now I'm in, 
With the negotiatior, 
And he says to me: 
"You dont wana die boy, 
It's not the right time, 
You have a bright mind, 
You'll do great things, 
In your lifetime." 
I screamed "no"! 
I beat his a$$, 
He turned around, 
I seen his wings, (bling!) 
And just then, 
The bell rings, 
I was in school, 
It was just a dream. 

Oh God (Oh God) 
Oh God (Oh God) 
Oh God (Oh God) 

Hey! 

It won't be long, 
Till you see me on the news! 
Another soul lost at sea, 
Were taking a cruise! 
Gasping for air makes the righteous path, 
Harder to choose. 
Well its either fly or die, 
Sink or swim, 
Which one shall I choose!?
