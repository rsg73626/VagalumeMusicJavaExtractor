WINDOWS

Verse 1

Every single night I'm starring in her window..
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
She's fresh in her towel & the lights are dimmed low
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
If you've seen what I've seen, she's a Ten Yo!
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow

[Chorus]
You would be starring in her windows
The eyes are the windows to the soul
You would be starring in her windows

Verse 2
My Best friend said I shouldn't do this no more
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
Well I guess that means I am very different from my friends SO
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
'cause if you've seen what I 've seen she's a Ten Yo!
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow

[Chorus]

Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
Talking
Look at her she's my medicine
All those magazines & all that estrogen
I bet she like me, but my conscience says to guess again
If she ever did I would be ready then

The best time to watch is like 1 or 2 o'clock
In a perfect world, she could come over & rock
I wonder if she would be fumbling a lot
She's taking off her clothes and 'bout to close the win-dow.

Verse 3
She slipped the bill through my gate that was entitled "Windows"
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
She said don't go Micro-soft you like it when I bend low..
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
She said, I see what you mean 'cause that's my twin, Yo
Win-do-do-do-do-do-dow
and umm.. We see you starring in our windows...

Damn
They caught me starring in her window
