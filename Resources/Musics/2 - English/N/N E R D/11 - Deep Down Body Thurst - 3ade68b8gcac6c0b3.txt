DEEP DOWN BODY THURST

Oh, and hey, by the way
You're-eh-uh
Oh and hey, by the way
You're-eh-uh

All the stuff that you said
Hey, buddy, now
Yeah, I heard what you said
All bets are off
You're a choke artist, man
[?]
Running against my race [?]
We're all like the maddening
The american mall
Where corporations won't pay
For effects they cause

Oh, you won't get away
Even in your fast car
Oh, you won't get away
Sending your son to the stars
Oh, you won't get away, hey hey
Smoke in the garage
Going to your head
'cause your intentions are dead
Dead wrong

Deep, deep down body thurst
Wrong
Deep down body thurst
Hey hey, yay yah

Oh, you won't get away, yeah
Oh, and hey, by the way
Man, fuck what you say
We're gonna climb your wall
Ok murphy's law
It'd be worth the fall
I sure hope you're just talking mad
And that's all
'cause we'll go over it, under it
We have the gall
Oh, you're not the milky-way
Or the center star
It doesn't matter what you win
If inside your loss

Oh, you won't get away
The way you treat islam
Oh, you won't get away
Jesus will open his arms
Oh, you won't get away, hey hey
Mr wizard of oz
It must be going to your head
'cause your intentions are dead
Dead wrong

Deep, deep down body thurst
Wrong
Deep down body thurst
Hey hey, yay yah

Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
As you listen to this, know that with [?]
Oh, and hey, by the way
