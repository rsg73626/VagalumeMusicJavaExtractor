MY DRIVE THRU

I want you
Do you want me too?
I have one question
Can I help you?
Now watch me
What I do
Now thank you
For coming through my drive-thru

When you're haunted by the demons that'll never let you rest
Not shy in front of crowds, but shy in front of just one guest
Not dumb enough to win at their game
But not smart enough to dumb it down and take it away
It's black and white, like space at night
If you wanna be like us, you better work every night

One question, what's your impression?
Now with a walk like mine I'm a big presence
So make your move real slow, my mind's a weapon
I said just move in slow, no second guessing
I find your approach so adolescent
I may look young but your game is prepubescent
So watch my feet, I'm known for my quick steppin'
You wanna keep up, gotta show me somethin'

Oh!
Look at all the leaders hanging in the playground
Always beating up the weaker ones
(Going after you)
The answer to the question and another mission
Is a word that I have never
(Going after you)
You think happiness is watching tv all night long
You dig the job of dealing over people in this song
Well I am here to change your world
I regret everything I've done

You wonder how I do, I inspire
Got the world spinning round inside my palm
Don't hate me 'cause you know they got you wired
You better show how search can be all over now
'Cause we all wanna dance, just wanna dance, dance
We wanna dance, just wanna dance
'Cause we all wanna dance, just wanna dance, dance
We wanna dance, just wanna dance

It's summer (summer)
In the city (city)
It's summer (summer)
In the city (city)
I want so bad to dance with you
Don't waste your time with one or two
The time is right, the summer night
You fall in love at every light

You wonder how I do, I inspire
Got the world spinning round inside my palm
Don't hate me 'cause you know they got you wired
You better show how search can be all over now
'Cause we all wanna dance, just wanna dance, dance
We wanna dance, just wanna dance
'Cause we all wanna dance, just wanna dance, dance
We wanna dance, just wanna dance
