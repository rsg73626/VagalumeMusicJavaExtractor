ROLLINEM 7'S (FEAT. ANDRÃ‰ 3000)

Mad ethnic right now

Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
All you pearls and kings and queens
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You should be considering
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
We can turn you into smithereens
Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
If people take away your walk
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven

All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
Roll around, I roll around, I'm rollin' them 7's

You gotta keep it rollin'
All of my girls wanna be my heaven
You gotta keep it rollin'
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Roll around, I roll around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'

Time Pterodactyls over all the way I see
I notice fractals, clover, honey bee, that's why
I kinda cackle, it be funny, see, haha
I ain't an actor, well sometimes I be, action
I got a gash on both my arms and knees, I be
Blockin' Alaska, they be coldin' me, achoo
I can't imagine the hood in harmony, I mean
How can I bask in a bloody Sun if he don't see
Me as a man? So I'm a hunted beast to him
I panoramic, look around, I be on edge
And eggshells, yeah I'm an omelette, a quiche
I catch hell, they throwin' fireballs to me
My bitch yell, pussy, leave my baby alone
I'm like, look girl, get your ass inside, now gon'
I would miss her if I knocked this piggy off
But I deserve the same as white niggas, I thought

Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
Roll, roll, roll, roll, rollin' them 7's
