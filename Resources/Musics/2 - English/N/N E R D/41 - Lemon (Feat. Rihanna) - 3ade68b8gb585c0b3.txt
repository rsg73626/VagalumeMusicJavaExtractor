LEMON (FEAT. RIHANNA)

The truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off

Hate! Bad bitches wanna be my bae
Hate! Hold me down like the C. I. A
Hate! Side of my car, tryna see my face
Hate! Want me to beat it like the T. I. case
Oh (hate!) and if it's heated I'ma feed my face
Hate! And best believe, it's gon' be outrageous
Hate! Hatin' niggas can't believe my race
Hate! Niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Shut up, hit them round, people

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' live
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can find P with the skateboard in the La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I prayed
It's Rihanna nigga, my consolation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' live
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

You can catch me
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
