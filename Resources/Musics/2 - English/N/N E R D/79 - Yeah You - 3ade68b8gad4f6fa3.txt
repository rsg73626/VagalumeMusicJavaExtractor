YEAH YOU

[Verse 1]
I was at show backstage untying my shoes
There was your friend from wireimage standing beside her was you
And Nigo told me don't do it my nice image would go up in fumes
The head without the ears heard it so you end up in my room

Chorus:
Textin me a 100 times
Callin me a 100 times
Hope it is not you this time
Damn I gotta change my line
Textin me you're gonna die
Call a psychiatric line
Friends and family should know I'm
Reportin this as a crime

I bet you heard this song wonderin' who im talkin bout x4

You!
Ooo - oo - oo Yeah Baby! x2

[Verse 2]
The frustrating nights emails that could evoke tears
(I like you I like you I love you I think im dying)
My friend asked me for your email address she said she'd take it from here
She said she'd tried to walk you through the picture (he doesnt like you)
but for you nothing is clear (ha ha but why?)
Now she too is frustrated and damn thats been a year

Chorus:
Textin me a 100 times
Callin me a 100 times
Hope it is not you this time
Damn I gotta change my line
Textin me you're gonna die
Call a psychiatric line
Friends and family should know I'm
Reportin this as a crime

I bet you heard this song wonderin' who im talkin bout
I said, I bet you heard this song wonderin' who im talkin bout
I bet you heard this song wonderin' who im talkin bout x2

You!
Ooo - oo - oo Yeah Baby! x2

Bridge: (Shae)
As you listen to this song
I hope your thought process evolves
Its not your reasoning thats wrong
Its that deep down everything is gone
The place is empty no lights on
Instead happiness you'll be sprawled
Across the face of your hearts wall
But you'll press pause and you'll just call....

Pharrell: oh baby you cant help yourself x2

I bet you heard this song wonderin' who im talkin bout (4x)

You!
Ooo - oo - oo Yeah Baby! x2

You!
