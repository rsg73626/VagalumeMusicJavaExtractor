RUN TO THE SUN

Thinking about the time we share 
And how I wasn't there 
It hurt me 
These people overwork me 
Then I heard maybe soon you'll leave 
Excuse me lord if you have tricks up your sleeve 
I'm not ready to be bereaved 
I know I'm always asking for something 
Or another 
But this time, it's just time 
'Cause I love her 
But baby if he don't change his mind 
Or fate or time 
Yo I want to leave you with this line 

[Chorus]
It goes while you're here 
I wanna tell you something 
It's that I love you girl 
Yeah, and I wish we could run to the sun 
And never come back 
Yeah 

Yesterday I tied two rocks together 
That symbolize our lives 
And threw them in the ocean 
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin' 
'Til they stop rollin' so far 

That no sonar would list them 
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed 
I know that may sound twisted 
But my neglect is killin' me 
I feel so guilty 
Please have faith in if you feel me 

[Repeat Chorus 2X]

Though you're probably feelin' blue 
And you'll do what you must do 
I hope you know 
I'd hand the skies to you 
I'm so embarrassed for mankind 
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine 
They're so stupid 
Do they not know you're about to fly high 
Away 

With the wings that God will give you someday 
I'm not jealous 
I just can't take it 
S.O.S. to your ears, the only thing I ever feared was this day 
And having to say 

[Chorus]
