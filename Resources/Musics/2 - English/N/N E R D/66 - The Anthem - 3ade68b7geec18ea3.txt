THE ANTHEM

yeah, here we go
It's a new day but it all feels old
It's a good life that's what i'm told
But everything it all just feels the same
And my high school it felt more to me, like a jail cell
A penetentiary, my time spent there it only made me see

That i don't ever wanna be like you and i don't 
wanna do the things you do, 
Im never gonna hear the words you say 
And i don't ever wanna, i don't ever wanna be

CHORUS
You, don't wanna be just like you
What i'm saying is this is the anthem
throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Go to collage a university
Get a real job that's what they said to me
But i could never live the way they want
Ima get by and just do my time at a step while they all get in line
Ima just a minort so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be just like them
Do you really wanna be another trend
Do you wanna be part of that crowd, cos i don't ever wanna
i don't ever wanna be

CHORUS
you,
shake it once that's fine
shake it twice that's ok
shake it three times you're playin with yourself again

you don't wanna be just like you
and what im sayin is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
ya'll got to feel me sing if your with me
you don't wanna be just like you x2
