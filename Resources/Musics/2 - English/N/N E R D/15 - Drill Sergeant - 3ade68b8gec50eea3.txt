DRILL SERGEANT

"Drill Sergeant"

[Clapping hands]

[Chorus] 
Drill sergeant, I don't work for you 
I'm not going to war (I'm not going to war) 
I'mma cash in beautiful books 
I work at the Barnes and Nobles store (Barnes and Noble store)
You must think you're Orson Wells
And this is 1954 
You don't understand liberty until 
Someone speaks for y'all (someone speaks for y'all) 

Shame on you, 
You say you served your country 
While I'm young 
Shame on you, 
Mixin' my mind up, handing me guns 
Byebye Mom and Dad and all 
Just incase there's failure 
I could be blaming you 
But I've got something to tell you... 

[Chorus] 

Aim on you 
Level their buildings, destroy their soil
Aim on you 
Did you finally figure where to run that oil? 
Why cry if a man should die, when there's probable failure? 
Or I could just aim at you 
But I got something to tell ya... 

[Chorus] 

Maybe there's another way 
That we can bumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbump [4x]

[Chorus] 

Oooh, I'm not going to war, i'm not going to [4x]
Hey!
