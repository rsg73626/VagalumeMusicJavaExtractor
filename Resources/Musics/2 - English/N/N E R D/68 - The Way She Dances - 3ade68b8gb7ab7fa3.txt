THE WAY SHE DANCES

Unzip your skirt
Take off your blouse
I hope your toes are painted
'Cause you're gone dance in your undies all over your house
When your eyes are closed I hope I'm the man you see (the man you see)
'Cause if not, I want you to know, tonight I plan to be
Is this for me? HO!

Slow motion like a dream but real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream but real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl I love the way you dance, yeah

I am in your aquarium
Are you are mermaid or somethin'?
Is it possible to marry one?
Big tits and a fat ass and turquoise fin
When your eyes are closed I hope I'm the man you see
'Cause if not, I want you to know tonight I plan to be
Is this for me? HO!

Slow motion like a dream but real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream but real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl I love the way you dance, yeah

Calling all cars, please arrest her
She's a criminal in my dreams
She just stole my heart
It's a A.P.B.

HEY!
Slow motion like a dream but real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream but real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl I love the way you dance, yeah

Kissing you, kissing me, it's euphoria,
But mission 2 and mission 3 is kissing 4 of ya
When sparks fly,
When sparks fly,
I think that's love
When sparks fly,
When sparks fly,
Don't you think?
Close your eyes hold my hand concentration
No destination just dance on constellations
When sparks fly,
When sparks fly,
I think that's love
When sparks fly,
When sparks fly,
Don't you think?

Excuse me but girl come with me,
See you and I can be, each other's company
Can't you see?
When sparks fly,
When sparks fly,
I think that's love
When sparks fly,
When sparks fly,
Don't you think?
