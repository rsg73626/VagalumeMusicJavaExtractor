HAPPY

The summer's gone too soon
The winters coming now
And lives are falling and
I'm just brawling
You had me going out of my head

And I look stupid
The game was grusome
We'll be for a while
And then it'd leave for a while
but there's no need for u now
Because I'm free of you now
You see I'm

(Chorus)
Happy (happy)
Things are lookin good now (good now)
I feel so alive( so alive)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killing it, I'm killing it

(Good, I'm good)
Don't try coming back
(Good, I'm good)
Cause I will not be there
(Good, I'm good)
Its not like u ever cared

(Verse 2)
Smiles would die too soon
Our days were filled with frowns
My job was calling
My life was falling
My friends said I looked like I was dead
Did I look stupid
Damn u cupid
You were shooting at me instead of landing on her
If this is how it should be
We should have stayed how we were
Cause now I'm

(Chorus)
Happy (happy)
Things are lookin good now (good now)
I feel so alive( so alive)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killing it, I'm killing it

(Good, I'm good)
Don't try coming back
(Good, I'm good)
Cause I will not be there
(Good, I'm good)
Its not like u ever cared

Damn you're stupid
How'd u lose it
U had it all but u treated it wrong
U got some things to resolve
So I requested this song
Cause I'm just

(Chorus)
Happy (happy)
Things are lookin good now (good now)
I feel so alive( so alive)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killing it, I'm killing it

(Good, I'm good)
Don't try coming back
(Good, I'm good)
Cause I will not be there
(Good, I'm good)
It's not like u ever cared
