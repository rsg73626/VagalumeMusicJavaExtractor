PROVIDER

Provider | TOP


Woke up I had the same clothes on I had on last night
Damn 
I must have passed out
And cash is just like the clothes I worn yesterday
We are broke 
Damn
I gotta get my ass out
I went to see what my friend was talking about
Drugs
He told me cocaine would get you clout 
My momma said he’s trouble and schools my route
But I went to high school and got kicked out 
So I’m driving this truck down the 95
I pray to God I make it home alive
I don’t get pulled over by the man
I just want to make it home to hold your hand

Chorus

Goodbye beloved one
Do you know what I am
If you don’t see my face no more
I’m a provider girl, gotta face the streets tonight

Goodbye beloved one
Do you know what I am
You don’t see my face no more
I’m a rider, girl gotta face the streets tonight
You say you don’t want me to go but I have to 
Please don’t weep
I love you

I refuse to be a bum
Especially coming where I’m from
I’m a provider girl
And I love you
So it’s just like I said before 
Heading down 95
Dodging Johnny law
I don’t need a ticket though I never got one
If he pulls me over
He can feel my shotgun
I think about life pull down my hat 
It’s just like this road I don’t know where I’m at
I don’t want to be another cocaine story
Will I find my sanity 
Where I find my glory
Come on

Repeat Chorus

Someday, Someday, this will be over
We’ll raise a family
I’ll get a job and I’ll be a voter
And if I die
It will change you
Change you
I watch over a family
But only as an angel

So don’t tell me you don’t know what you see
When you’re looking at a motherfucker just like me
I’m a provider girl
I said don’t tell me you don’t know what you see
When you’re looking at a motherfucker just like me
I’m a rider girl

Repeat Chorus

I love you girl
I’m doing this for us 
I don’t know any better
What am I supposed to do
Nothing I love you
