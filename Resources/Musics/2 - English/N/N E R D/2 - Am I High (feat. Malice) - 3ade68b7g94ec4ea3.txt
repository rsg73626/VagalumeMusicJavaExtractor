AM I HIGH (FEAT. MALICE)

La la la la 
Listen 
La la la 
Hey 
Didn't you know I can help or hurt you 
So there's no reason to lie 
I bet you let those other niggas jerk you 
Convince you that they are fly 
I never said I was an angel 
Said but I ain't like those other guys 
Listen 
You're convinced that our experience rearranged you 
Well maybe you should reexamine 
How you tried 
Or 

[3x]
Am I High 

I think I've loved you since our high school 
But you only wanted friends of mine 
So when they replied 
Her she's cool 
Only then you gave our friendship time 
You won't say it but you think I'm changing 
Is it because the whole world calls me drugs 
Didn't I say I can help or hurt you 
You should be paranoid without me 
and with me feel a buzz 
Is that cocky or what 
Or 

[3x]
Am I High 

It's the kinda high that got me leaning 
120 speeding in the rain 
Meaning of a hydroplane 
Play both sides of the field 
See I know pain 
Keep 'em high like Kurt Cobain 
Listen 
I'm known for speaking my mind 
Known for fleeing from the scene of a crime 
Eyes redder than the beam of my nine 
Eyes redder than the scene of that crime 
All for the love of the lime 
I'm so high 

Insinuating you're not that way 
I see how you look and use your eyes 
But when I ask you can I jump in 
Then you start again with the lines 
But if I dare you you'd blow a kiss to another 
Though my friends have no idea who you could be 
Don't worry I would never tell another 
But I ate your pussy as you layed there beside her yes she was asleep 

[3x]
Am I High 

Why am I sitting here 
Peering the sky 
Is there something inside of me or am I high 
From when we talk on the phone 'til when we fuck 
This sounds like deep lust to me 
But I get high on your love 

Am I High
