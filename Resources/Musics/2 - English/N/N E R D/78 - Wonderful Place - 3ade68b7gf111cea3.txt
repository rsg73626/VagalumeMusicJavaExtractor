WONDERFUL PLACE

[Verse] 
Damn, it's setting in now (so high) 
Cuz cartoons are turning into real life 
Lemons and limes are fighting 
Fighting over straws 
Like they were oil filled pipes 

And why's the sun writing this song 
And why is this funny to me 
All of a sudden the mouse comes along 
And what he sings brings harmony 

[chorus] 
You may not understand 
Why there's a smile on my face 
It's cuz this world could be 
Such a wonderful place 

Cuz some of these companies 
Two-thousand began a race ??
But not me man 
I see a wonderful place 
The world's a wonderful place 

My soul's in my smile 
Don't frown 
Just get up get up 

Look at the birds 
Look at the bees 
Look at the skies 
Look at the seas 
It's a wonderful place 

Look at the planes 
Look at the cars 
Look at the sun 
Look at the stars 

[verse] 
The wallpapers moving 
My arms and my legs leave 
A blur when i swipe 
Sap is just oozing 
The trees say "smoke blocks the sun" 
So for them it's just night 

The seven eyes look in thru the clouds 
And why is that funny to me 
And here comes the mouse singing loud 
And what he sings brings harmony 

[chorus]
