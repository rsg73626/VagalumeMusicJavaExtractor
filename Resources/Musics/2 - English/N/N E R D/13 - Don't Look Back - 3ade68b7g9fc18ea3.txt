DON'T LOOK BACK

"Yo, what's up Pharrell? How you feelin?"
"Good."
"Hey Shay, wake up man."
"I'm here."
"There's no turning back now."
"I know man, I'm ready to go."
"You ready?"
"Hell yeah."
"Yeah, lets go."

We're the gladiators, taking my heart won't be that easy
So send in your lies, I'll fly so high the birds won't reach me

So prepare yourself (ready)
Screw everyone else (lets go)
Cause time is counting down (ready)
It looks like it's now (lets go)

Just go
There's moments when you've been cold
Don't look back
Ages waitin' for you to fall
Never look back
When the first police come, all the seized crawl
Don't look back
Angels smile, so give it your all
Never look back

Kept my eyes on the prize, the next step in my evolution
Is to realize (realize), my life is just a crazy ride

So prepare yourself (ready)
Screw everyone else (lets go)
Cause time is counting down (ready)
It looks like it's now (lets go)

Just go
There's moments when you've been cold
Don't look back
Ages waitin' for you to fall
Never look back
When the first police come, all the seized crawl
Don't look back
Angels smile, so give it your all
Never look back

We'll fold down the pressure, I'm not the type to stop until i'm done
Addicted with fear my skin, it's not the end it's just the beginning

Ready .. lets go (x2)

Just go
There's moments when you've been cold
Don't look back
Ages waitin' for you to fall
Never look back
When the first police come, all the seized crawl
Don't look back
Angels smile, so give it your all
Never look back

So prepare yourself (ready)
Screw everyone else (lets go)
Cause time is counting down (ready)
It looks like it's now (lets go)
