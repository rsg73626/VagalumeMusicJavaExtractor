1000 (FEAT. FUTURE)

Ah, ah
Assembling a riot
Chanting and circling the fires
Heard behavior, can't keep it quiet
Kinetic energy a thousand times higher

Holy shit it's working, we all got in
Holy shit it's working, now look at my friends
Holy shit it's working, it's bitter to the taste
Holy shit it's working, we dancin' in place
What goes up must come down
What goes in must come out
You surrounded, dawg, come on look around
I was zen, but no not now
Holy shit it's working, no more trail of tears
Holy shit it's working, the prophecy is here
Holy shit it's working, we're wreckin' this bih
Holy shit it's working, one thousand percent

In the mirror, there's a hero
One, zero, zero, zero
Hey, hey, hey, one thou'
Git, one thou'
Hunnud, 1000
Uh, 1000

My girl don't wear shoes unless they cost over a thousand
Brand new coupe cost couple hundred thousand
Got some models in the bed and they coming by the thousand
Them young goons never sleep, they somewhere prowling
Everywhere we go they tote a chopper by the thousand
Rick Owens boots, I'm walking on a few thousand (ayy)
Champagne in the club costs thousands
We got gold by the bar, that's thousands
Ferragamo belt will hit me for a even thousand
We can gamble right now, bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Count the money up in all hundreds, all thousand
I'm too rich to talk if ya ain't talking thousands

In the mirror, there's a hero
One, zero, zero, zero

Assembling a riot
Chanting and circling the fires
Heard behavior, can't keep it quiet
Kinetic energy a thousand times higher
Holy shit it's working, I'm feeling like a saint
Holy shit it's working, my feel sorry, can't
Holy shit it's working, we painted our face
Holy shit it's working, the rainbow angst

One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
In the mirror, there's a hero
One, zero, zero, zero

Act like you don't really hear a lot
You can pretend when you are
Karma makes sure tears will drop
You'll be wishing that your year will stop
It will be a thousandfold one, zero, zero, zero, dot
Act like you don't really hear a lot
You can pretend when you are
Karma makes sure tears will drop
You'll be wishing that your year will stop
It will be a thousandfold one, zero, zero, zero, dot

One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
In the mirror, there's a hero
One, zero, zero, zero
Hey, hey, hey, one thou'
Git, one thou'
Hunnud, 1000
Uh, 1000
