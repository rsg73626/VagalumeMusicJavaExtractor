LOVE BOMB

Verse 1:
Sitting here in this white, padded room
Imagining I'm a meteor flying out through the distant space
How this tiny speckle Earth destroyed tomorrow
So capable of so many things
Why make life taking planes
But I believe
That when you lose your route
Just use the sunlight
It could be your guide
No more political dreams
Not another excuse
Don't need another love song We need a love bomb

Chorus:
To just blow us away
To freakin' blow all the lights out
Turning night to day
Hear it from miles away
A chance to make it right now
Fuck what the government says
We gotta save some life now
Is that OK?

Verse 2:
Can't you see
This is The Truman Show baby
'Cause when they fight who dies--it's you
Oh, and if you unscrew me
We've got the same gear and the same tools
But how you gonna catch up with your head hanging down
Whatcha see staring at the ground
But I believe
Even without a clue
You got sunlight
And it could be your guide
No more political dreams
Not another excuse
Don't need another love song We need a love bomb

Chorus:
To just blow us away
To freakin' blow all the lights out
Turning night to day
Hear it from miles away
A chance to make it right now
Fuck what the government says
We gotta save some life now
Is that OK?

Bridge:
I'm trying to un-blind a few
by removing propaganda but,
They must of used a devil superglue
I'm tryin' to take the machine apart yeah
What I'm simply trying to do
Is have the listener take a pause
I've been down every avenue,
But everybody's good as gone

Chorus:
To just blow us away
To freakin' blow all the lights out
Turning night to day
Hear it from miles away
A chance to make it right now
Fuck what the government says
We gotta save some life now
Is that OK?
