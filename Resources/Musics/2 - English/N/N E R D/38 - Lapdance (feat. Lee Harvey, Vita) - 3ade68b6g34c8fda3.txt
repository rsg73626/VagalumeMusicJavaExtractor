LAPDANCE (FEAT. LEE HARVEY, VITA)

8x
I'm a dirty dog

1st Verse

I'm an outlaw
Quick on the draw
Something you never seen before
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
I got something chrome
And I got it from home
And it ain't a microphone
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

It's so real
How I feel
It's this society
That makes a nigga want to kill
I'm just straight ill
Riding my motorcycle down the streets
While politicians is sounding like strippers to me

They keep saying
But I don't want to hear it

Chorus

3x
Ooo baby you want me
3x
Well you can get this lapdance here for free

Ooo baby you want me
Well you can get this lapdance here for free

2nd verse

It's a raw night
Who wants to bar fight
Well come on alright
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

Baseball bats
I got something for that
It goes clack clack clack clack 
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

It's so real
How I feel
It's this society
That makes a nigga want to kill
I'm just straight ill
Riding my motorcycle down the streets
While the government is sounding like strippers to me
They keep saying
But I don't want to hear it

Chorus

Lee Harvey Rap Verse:

When you think of Harvey
Think of a Harley
Blue Denim
Spike wrist and chromebie
Lap screws and tattoos
That's all me
Two girls both arms feeling like Fonzy
You can find me drunk
Whippin' and might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court smokin' that nice grass
Burning the flag all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby
With Christ on my arm
I'm gnarly baby
Fuck with me
Not hardly baby
And you know the flow
Ungodly baby
So let's party baby
Chicks nicknamed me pilot
They get high off my dick
I take them to my home
They call it the cockpit
Time to take off their panties
They drop quick
Now that's first class fuckin'
Ain't that some fly shit
