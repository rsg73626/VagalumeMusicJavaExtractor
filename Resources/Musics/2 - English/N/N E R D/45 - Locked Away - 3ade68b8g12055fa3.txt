LOCKED AWAY

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Changed your mind
I made you live a lover's life
Changed your mind about all guys
No kiss at the end of the night
But if you will with me
When I'm sure that you can see
So when I ask you, "How you think it'd be?"
Just when I thought you would say to me... No!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams] (Spymob vocalists)
You keep me locked away (locked aaa-wayy..)
You don't want - to admit
About me and you (meee and yoouuu..)
Hey! But I don't care cause
You make life worth living (living..)
You make love worth giving (giving..)
You make time worth spending (spending..)
Well why ain't we worth admitting? (admitting..)

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
When you were in my arms
Though inside, I could see the stars
As if they were not far
I read what they were sayin
They said the world is yours
With her make it better
So imagine you two together
It'd be so amazing

[Chorus]

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
(Hey..)
Hey but what if you
Miraculously feel what I do
Our split up can't beat us two
If I could speak in invisible proof
And you're writing the same
Except you swap our names
Trying to figure out this weird ass game
And you're like real confused.. shit

[Chorus]

[Outro: Spymob vocalists]
Locked away.. mee and yoouuu
Living.. giving
Spending.. admitting
