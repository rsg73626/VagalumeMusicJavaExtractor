SECRET LIFE OF TIGERS

You're saying welcome to the jungle
Got all this freedom in the rumble
Your mom's against the immigration
Your dad's against your life to choose

Screaming with saliva
Secret Life Of Tigers
Bite your neck off bitch
Fuck you with survivors
I understand it strangely
Welcome to [?]
Credit card pay attention
Watch the mob get angry

Are you mad right now?
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now?
Pipe down, pipe down

You're up all night
Woo
You're up all night
Woo
You're up all night
Woo
You up all night
You know what day it is, right?
That alien life
They say it ain't right
I'm kinda afraid of here and after
Do you mind [?] me and you
Cuz' this room got more space than Nasa
You serious

It's the badgers
It's the badgers
It's the badgers
It's the badgers
It's the badgers
It's the badgers
It's the badgers
It's the badgers

Are you mad right now?
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now?
Pipe down, pipe down
You'll be up all night

You're up all night
Woo
You up all night
Woo
You up all night
Woo

You climbing up that styling ladder
You feel like Ac when it's June
Your parents discriminate with the [?]
These girls are in your room

Screaming with saliva
Secret Life Of Tigers
Bite your neck off bitch
You're fucking with survivors
I understand it strangely
Welcome to [?]
Credit card pay attention
Watch the mob get angry

Are you mad right now?
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now?
Pipe down, pipe down
You'll be up all night

You'll be up all night
Woo
You up all night
Woo
You up all night
Woo
That alien life
They say it ain't right

It's the badgers

I'm kinda afraid of here and after
Do you mind [?] me and you
Cuz' this room got more space than Nasa
You serious

Sensation, I've got it backwards
Society got you feeling ass hurt
Get in, get out, get away
So, kids come home

Are you mad right now?
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now?
Pipe down, pipe down
You'll be up all night

You'll be up all night
Woo
You up all night
Woo
You up all night
Woo
That alien life
They say it ain't right
