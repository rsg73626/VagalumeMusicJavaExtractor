IT'S ALMOST OVER NOW

fuckin posers-
yo yo yeah(4x)
uh
yeah
Fuckin' posers 
It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

for ya fuckin posers
yeah
its almost over now
almost over now

You think the way you lives okay 
You think posing 
Will save the day 
You think we don't see 
That you're running 
Better call your boys 
'Cause I'm coming 

[Chorus]

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star 
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car 
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

guess 
You ain't heard that we swallow guys 
It's too damn late to apologize 
Will you see the mantle or will you see the skies 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

You think that you don't have to ever quit 
You think that you can get away with it 

You think the light won't be ever lit 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now 

Something's on your chest 
Better get it off 
There'll be no one left when we set it off 
We ain't gonna take it no more 
Since 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now 

You had plenty of time 
There was no rush 
But it was your dream to be like us 
You're in dreamland so you don't care 
And as you wait(im standing there,im standing there mother fucker) 
we're standing there 

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star 
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car 
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

i guess 
You ain't heard that we swallow guys 
It's too damn late to apologize 
Will you see the mantle or will you see the skies 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

You think that you don't have to ever quit 
You think that you can get away with it 

You think the light won't be ever lit 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now 

Something's on your chest 
Better get it off 
There'll be no one left when we set it off 
We ain't gonna take it no more 
Since 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now

You don't succeed cause you hesitate 
You think we're fly 
But we levitate 
Just be yourself 
Don't ask us why 
'Cause if you don't we'll make you fly 

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star 
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car 
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

i guess 
You ain't heard that we swallow guys 
It's too damn late to apologize 
Will you see the mantle or will you see the skies 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

You think that you don't have to ever quit 
You think that you can get away with it 

You think the light won't be ever lit 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now 

Something's on your chest 
Better get it off 
There'll be no one left when we set it off 
We ain't gonna take it no more 
Since 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now

You can't be me 
I'm a Rock Star 
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car 
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

i guess 
You ain't heard that we swallow guys 
It's too damn late to apologize 
Will you see the mantle or will you see the skies 

It's almost over now 
It's almost over now 

You think that you don't have to ever quit 
You think that you can get away with it 

You think the light won't be ever lit 

It's almost over now 
Almost over now 

Something's on your chest 
Better get it off 
There'll be no one left when we set it off 
We ain't gonna take it no more 
Since 

It's almost over now
