LOSER

You gotta win (x3)

You gotta win cos I’m a win

You gotta win (x3)

See I’m a win, I’m a win

We will not be the losers
We won’t leave till our job is done
We will not be the losers
Sorry but we’re not the ones

I will have my eyes focused (on strength) and
My feet on the ground
I will run through the middle 
And lay them all down
I'm the carrier of the torch
To make my path I’ll burn
My words – are slurred

We will not be the losers
We won’t leave till our job is done
We will not be the losers
Sorry but we’re not the ones

I know that they’re coming to do what they can
I’ll stare upon and smash them, and face them like a man
I know I must face my country, I have to face my town
So I can’t let them down

[Rap - Malice]
Look at me running
Is on I’m coming
Went on my back I’ll be floating
I’m steady and loud, my mother be proud,
Her eyes is tear as shes choking
We did this for who? The ones who are true
Supporting the dream that I’m living,
And for my squad, the whole nine yards,
The name of my team I’m defending

[Rap – Pusha T]
It’s all wrong, I won’t stop till it’s all gone,
As I leave with a long bond
You know me, number 4-4,
Black and white run it back but in slow-mo,
I’m a veteran, Part'a the better man,
Just like the metal ends, ran like I never ran
In this game o’ life, we gon’ play ball,
Us against them, we gon’ lay them all

[Spoken - Pharrell]
We will not be the losers
We won’t leave till our job is done

We will not be the losers
We won’t leave till our job is done
We will not be the losers
Sorry but we’re not the ones

I'm prepared to go the distance, and battle to the end,
I will fight to the twilight scene, my family depend,
The desert is so cloudy, my niggers are to see,
There’s a chance, and that chance is me

Cos I’m a win (x3)
Cos I’m a win (x3)
