HYPNOTIZE U

[Pharrell]
I like you
You so special

Just close your eyes let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I’ll find you,
if I’m not beside you I’m behind you
Imagine you,r’ on the beach in your laws,
you feel the breeze because you’re clothes off
Your inhibitions you got nothing to hide
and then help ‘em rise don’t you wanna ride

Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl

I’m behind you,
Just close your eyes let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I’ll find you
if I’m not beside you I’m inside you
I’m your doctor, this is you therapy
Your money’s no good just take care of me
I found a issue, you my soldier type
But all that can change lets get loose tonight

Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl

I’m behind you
Just close your eyes let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I’ll find you
if I’m not beside you I’m inside you

You’re a dream, inception you my queen
Wait babe let me paint that wall
change the background take that off
in your eyes I could see you a winner
I know size(?) stop lying like Lior
you could stay but there’d be no me
but if you come and set you free

to the left, to the right
to the left, to the right

go on and touch it girl, go on and touch it girl
go on and touch it girl, go on and touch it girl

let me get close let me hypnotise you,
I can make your storm feel sky blue,
girl if you lost you know I’ll find you
If im not beside you I’m behind you

just close your eyes let me hypnotize you,

twenties, fifties, fives, tens, twenties, fifties, fives, tens,
twenties, fifties, fives, tens, twenties, fifties, fives, tens,
twenties, fifties, fives, tens, twenties, fifties, fives, tens,

Just close your eyes let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
girl when you lost you know I’ll find you
If I’m not beside you I’m inside you

Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
Touch a girl, touch a girl, touch a girl (ahhh)
