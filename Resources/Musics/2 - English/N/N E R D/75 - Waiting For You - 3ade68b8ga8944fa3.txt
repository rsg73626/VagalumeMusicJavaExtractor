WAITING FOR YOU

[Hidden track]

So she tells her man "lets go fishin"
Well go tommorow morning when the sun rise..
And then she says she wants to take her kids and (baby cries)
Thats her boy thats 12 and her daughter thats 4 with angel eyes
So they get there and the sun has barely risen
Decided on a spot where the fish is plentiful with the tide
Get out their poles daddy smiles and said the fish is jumpin
Then they heard a splash but it sounded bigger than fish size
[music changes]
12 yr old screams mom
And mom screams back
The baby was holdin your arm
Well that was 30 seconds ago
So they jumped in
All comin up with nothin
But then...
[music changes]
Something told mom to look toward the light
But the sun wasn't yellow
It had turned white
So she listen and swam
She swam for the light
Like the Michelin man
She swam with such might
She spotted the baby
And she was on her back
Just as the light said "Sunrise was Heaven's track"
She turned the baby over her eyes were still blue
Baby had a smile and said...
"I was waitin for you!"
[music changes]
Mom I was waitin for you!
Your baby!
Momma!
I love you!
And I was waitin for you!
Heyyyyy
[congo drums start playing]
I was waitin for you..
I was waiting for you..
Momma..
I was waiting for you..
I love you ma..
