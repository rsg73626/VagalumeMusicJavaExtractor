VOILÀ (FEAT. GUCCI MANE, WALE)

They think I'm a magician
Voilà, voilà
They think I know magic
Voilà, voilà
They think I go abracadabra, leave me, come back, cuz' I'm different
Oh mama, voilà, voilà
I might pull up in the bentley
Voilà, voilà
I might pull up in the benzes
Voilà, voilà
I might pull up in a skateboard
These hoes are still gonna pay me attention
Ooh baby, voilà, voilà

You are a magician
Voilà, voilà
You can make it happen
Voilà, voilà
So, when you say abracadabra, leave me, come back, it's something different
Voilà, voilà
Tell my mama I found the right man
You bounced in this section just to show us that you listening

Abracadabra, I get out the bed
I'm your mirror, I'm the voice inside your head
Some motivation to get you up
You can lift your butt without it being touched
You have not found what it took
Change the course of the night
Take this time to recharge
Pull yourself up til' the lights go off
Look around, where are your friends?
They'll be here in every life
Every time you need a lift, you'll know the tricks
We'll pull it off

They think I'm a magician
Voilà, voilà
They think I know magic
Voilà, voilà
They think I go abracadabra, leave me, come back, cuz' I'm different
Oh mama, voilà, voilà
I might pull up in the bentley
Voilà, voilà
I might pull up in the benzes
Voilà, voilà
I might pull up in a skateboard
These hoes are still gonna pay me attention
Ooh baby, voilà, voilà

You are a magician
Voilà, voilà
You can make it hapen
Voilà, voilà
So, when you say abracadabra, leave me, come back, it's something different
Voilà, voilà
Tell my mama I found the right man
You bounced in this section just to show us that you listening

I know you ain't ready to go, so much to do
Somebody said you ready to go
And it's up to you
You have not found what it took
Change the course of the night
Take this time to recharge
Pull yourself up til' the lights go off
Look around, we're your friends
We'll be here in every life
Every time you need a lift, you'll know the tricks
We'll pull it off

They think I'm a magician
Voilà, voilà
They think I know magic
Voilà, voilà
They think I go abracadabra, leave me, come back, cuz' I'm different
Different, different
Different, different

One time for my whole mob
One time for the whole squad
You told me you sobre
You can't get your dope off
All I know is gold bar
That's my vibe
I should cover The Source, 5 mics
You check in for nothing and get off the hustle
They say money talk, but can I pay you for a mussle?
I don't mean to ruffle
That's my vibe
You just smell like money, Chanel 5
