Ligtbulb, fire cause all that is
There was, will be, beyond beginnings and end
The town, they say it's you, stars of fire

Live wire go through your body
Burn the old and make you anew
It's a mystical experience party
The universal connection to you
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic

Lightning Fire Magic Prayer
Far beyond the gaseous layer
What if we all put our hands in the air?
For that Lightning Fire Magic Prayer

Sometimes, you may have to give up your things
We're bound to see your faith
You may not refer to my old name

Live wire go through your body
Burn the old and make you anew
It's a mystical experience party
The universal connection to you
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic
Where do I begin?

Catch me out here
Catch me out here
Catch me out here

They got that crazed look in their eyes
Something in the water
Everybody's in a trance
Because the brainwash is my tide
Something in the water
You can tell me to dance

Wasn't everything that everybody promised
Once you tried it, did you think that you could stop it?
Everything has a cause, did you profit?
You can't see us, until you sit and watch it

They got that crazed look in their eyes
Something in the water
Everybody's in a trance
Because the brainwash is my tide
Something in the water
You can tell me to dance

Seeing fish doesn't know that it bright
Once it swims, it starts drinking, it forgets
Know the fish bowl is your technology
No direction sailing everybody follow me

Lightning Fire Magic Prayer
Far beyond the gaseous layer
What if we all put our hands in the air?
For that Lightning Fire Magic Prayer
