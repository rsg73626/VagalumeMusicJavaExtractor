I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT/INSIDE OF CLOUDS

Four in the morning she appeared there to me
Said she had the secret to life
She wandered to my heart and said that you'll believe
Felt my neck and then opened my eyes

[Chorus]
But I've seen the light
I've seen the light, you're the one girl
And then it hit me, it felt like lightning
And then it hit me I wasn't frightened
Cause I've seen the light

Things will soon change, you will see, you will see
The light will chase away the dark
She said you'll be okay if you listen to me
All the superstars are burning out

[Chorus]
But I've seen the light
I've seen the light, you're the one girl
And then it hit me, it felt like lightning
And then it hit me I wasn't frightened
Cause I've seen the light

Yes we've got dreams, something you won't believe
The desert was hot, the air was dry
She gave me instruction to play my magic keys
And magic treats starts falling from the sky

[Chorus]
But I've seen the light
I've seen the light, you're the one girl
And then it hit me, it felt like lightning
And then it hit me I wasn't frightened
Cause I've seen the light


Inside Of Clouds (Interlude)

I can smell it when I go outside (outside)
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet (outside)
Thats what rains for

All the kids see rain and scream no no
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love her rain fills the potholes
Me and my cell but thats what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did something shade it?
The sun gives light cuz it is the window
The rain gives life cuz it is amazing

The inside of clouds (the inside of clouds)
Thats the window to the sky
Proves theres life
