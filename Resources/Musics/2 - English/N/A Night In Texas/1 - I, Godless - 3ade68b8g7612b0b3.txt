I, GODLESS

So it seems that I was deemed unreal
Only a myth, to frighten
Those who do not believe
Well I have finally surfaced
From my icy prison
And I bring the entirety
Of hell in the wake of me

With a thirst for human souls
And an insatiable fire that burns inside
I will strip them of their entity
And I will control everything in sight
For humanity is well beneath my feet

Begin pandemonium, a vile terror unleashed
Conceived within the holy fires of heaven
I once was enslaved but now I am free
Your fucking god was overcome
With fear and so he banished me
Henceforth to be known as satan
My real name was lost to me

I am godless

Though it matters not
What title I am bestowed
When immortal perfection beckons so close
I will rule and you will learn
Beauty exists only in exodus of earth
In the Immaculate ways the blood sprays
When flesh is torn ensuing unholy birth
Screams of anguish linger on

Amidst the turmoil appears a familiar sight
Draped in white robes
A man bearing an almost blinding light
God's "true" heir
The son of the man with no might
Comes before my power
To attempt to rectify my blight

A vile terror unleashed
Conceived within the holy fires of heaven
I once was enslaved but now I am free
Your fucking "god" was overcome
With fear and so he banished me
Henceforth to be known as satan
My real name was lost to me

Betrayal never goes unpunished
And yours is of the greatest heresy
I rip your heart right from your chest
And now there is empty space
Where your face used to be
Excitedly tearing your flesh from bone
Ever so delicately
As not to damage my new wardrobe
I merrily dance as I dress myself
In your skin like a taxidermy specimen

I will return to the highest of heavens
And all life will belong to me
There's nothing worthy left in my way
As I have now executed the nazarene
