COMING FROM THE HEART

[verse 1]
dont even wanna think about it think about losing you come on now just forget about it i dont no wat i'll do your the color in my picture the reason for my song your my sun light in early dawn (ummmm) everyday that i wake up it like i blessed all over again (oooo yea) to spend another day with you lets me know how blessed i am (i am) and no matter what we been through you never ran away wat im really trying to say
[Chorus]
it's coming from the heart all this things i say are real dont no where to start because everything you do fulfills breaks my every wish didn't know we'll be like this, this is coming from the heart coming from the heart
[verse 2]
are love is like the mountain i cant believe the clouds so high it coming from the heart and if we keep on claiming (claiming babe) i think we could touch the sky ( ooo it coming the heart) should the world ever stop turning i would still love you (yea i will) every word i say is true (ooo)
[Chorus]

[verse 3]
Each and every day (each and every day) we go through changes you don’t know who is by your side trying to find away (trying to find away) to different places different places best believe that I ……..
I’ll never ever leave you (yeaa) can’t see the day that I would there no scale that can messure unless it leads all the way so don’t you worry about nothing alright? Because I want you always (all I wanna say) that’s all (all I wanna say) I really wanna say (wow wow)
Have u ever tired to find the words to say what’s deep inside you can’t figure out the reason why they won’t just come out right but you gotta tell the world just how, how your life can be this is a song for you and me
[Chorus]
all this things i say are real dont no where to start because everything you do fulfills breaks my every wish didn't know we'll be like this, this is coming from the heart coming from the heart
