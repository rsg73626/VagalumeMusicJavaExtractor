ISSUES

[Chorus]
Can We Try To Work Out
Its no need to scream and shout
Lets make this love and turn it around
Cuz we got issues

[Verse 1:]
You can tell me that you love me
And make it sound so sweet
Then right around and cuss me
Right in the middle of the street
Now i can do my ususal thing
Jump in my car and speed away
But u know i come runnin back
To you the very next day
Can we work it out

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2:]
Everybody got some problems
That dont make them have doubts
Before the neighbors call the cops on us
Lets try and straightin' this thing out
If they knew you were gonna do some many things
Then itsjust not ment to be
I just want you to be happy baby
I just want you to be with me

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge:]
When you put out something
You get back somethin
You put out nuthin
You get the same
Cuz every were struggling
Tryna keep this love from falling down
And no one was the blame

Just a lil mo time just a little
Just a lil more trys just a little
Just a lil more love just a little
Cuz we got issues

[Chorus: till end]
