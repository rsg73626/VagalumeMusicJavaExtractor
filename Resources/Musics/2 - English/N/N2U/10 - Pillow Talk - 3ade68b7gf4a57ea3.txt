PILLOW TALK

(Spoken)

Good Mornin' Baby
I hope you had a good time last night
Check it out

Verse 1

So tasty like a chocolate covered candy
All I wanna hear you tell me, is that I'm yo man
Girl, don't you know that I'm your biggest fan
Mmm, the way you workin' me I don't understand
You're my first thought, when I wake
I adore you girl
You're my sunshine, my lucky charm
I adore you girl

Chorus

Who's is it baby? (Who's is it baby?)
Wanna hear you say it (say it)
Sounds so good when you call my name (call me)
The way you say it (say it)
You got me feenin'
Lost up in it deep inside yo love (2x)

Verse 2

Tonight ya body turn me on again
We're makin' love never finishin
Once we start, it's hard to stop
You on top, my head drops, oh
You're my first thought, when I wake
I adore you girl
You're my sunshine, my lucky charm
I adore you girl, me and you

Chorus

The way you say it, girl it's so crazy baby
That I don't believe that we make love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Chorus
