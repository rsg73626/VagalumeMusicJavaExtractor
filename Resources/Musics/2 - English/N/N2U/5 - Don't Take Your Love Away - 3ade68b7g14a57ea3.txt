DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE AWAY

I’m sorry for what I did baby
Would you please come back to me
I damn know what I did
I’ll never do you wrong again
Listen up

Sitting here and I’m thinking ‘bout
All the good times that we had
Try to figer out just how
How this good times turned to bad
Hold on, don’t you go away
It shouldn’t be that easy girl
All you did was perfect me girl
And I took advantage girl
I’m sorry that I hurt you
I just want to make true

Girl don’t take your love away now,
Woman I’m struggling, can’t be without your kissing and hugging
Girl don’t take your love away, baby
Cause I can’t live without you
And you know that it’s true
Honey, what would I do
If you take your love away

Stop right there, baby
Don’t you dare walk out that door
Can we please try to talk it out
(We just need to)
Work it out
(We don’t need to)
Scream and shout
I don’t mean to hurt you
Girl I’m just trying to get deal with you baby
Baby I apoligize, and I wanna tell you why
I was so wrong to you baby

Baby I’m sorry
For everytime I hurt you
Baby I’m sorry
Everytime I was so untrue
Baby I’m sorry
Everytime I didn’t come home
Baby I apoligize, and I wanna tell you why
Girl I wanna come home

Girl don’t take your love away now,
Woman I’m struggling, can’t be without your kissing and hugging
Girl don’t take your love away, baby
Cause I can’t live without you
And you know that it’s true
Honey, what would I do, honey
If you take your love away

I never meant to hurt you baby
I never meant to leave you
Please, just give me one more chance
I need you in my life baby
Trust, and believe me
Don’t take your love away

Girl don’t take your love away now,
Woman I’m struggling, can’t be without your kissing and hugging
Girl don’t take your love away, baby
Cause I can’t live without you
And you know that it’s true
Honey, what would I do, honey
If you take your love away
