BREAKIN' THE LAW

(Spoken)

Whatchu doin' right now? Imma come pick you up
Yeah, let's go for a ride
We're gonna break the law

Verse 1

Tryna do 65, baby but cha body won't let me
Cuz you're so damn tight
and I wanna cross the double line
But the last time that I did it
I got myself a ticket girl
Cause baby girl I don't mind (Imma take my chances)
If I'm caught I'll pay the fine (deal with the circumstance)
Cause if the judge only knew (if he know what i knew)
I know he'd wanna ride wit chu, ooh

Chorus

We're breakin the law tonight so don't be scared
and we're settin' it off tonight, it's bout to go there
We might do some time if they catch us, we'll be high-speed chasin'
Till ya body's makin' movin' violations
We're breakin the law tonight that's what we gon' do
So Don't worry bout traffic lights we breezin right through
I got my story, you're my alibi
So we're breakin the law tonight, we'll be breakin the law

Verse 2

This time I'm gon let you drive
Just pump them brakes, we can swerve, double round them curves
Cause tonight, we're gonna take a ride, baby
Ride, Ride, ride it, ride it, ride, let me ride
Cause baby girl I don't mind (I'm gonna take my chances)
If I'm caught I'll pay the fine (there'll be circumstances, circumstances)
Cause if the judge only knew (if the judge only knew)
I know he'd wanna ride wit chu, ooh

Chorus

Girl you know I got two stikes, one more time then I'll be doin life girl
I'm on probation for the last time
but what you got will make me wanna do the crime
You know i've been driving for awhile
I ain't never had nothin like this
I wanna slop it up (yeah)
I wanna tear it up (yeah)
So get ready for the time of your life

Chorus
