BEAUTY

oooooh yea
yea yea yeaaaa
oh oh oh ohh
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em

[ verse 1: ]
you can have the prettiest skin
prettiest eyes
prettiest smile with the thickest thighs
and a sex apply but that dont mean a thing to me
cuz without honesty or loyalty
you can only be a common enemy

[chorus:]
thats why
beauty can get em
but sure cant keep em
(beauty can get em but it sure cant keep em)
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em
its a plus but it dont mean nothin tho

[verse: 2]
without a good heart
what good are you to me
only impressed
by the things you see
SUV's with TV's, expensive clothes and accesories
if it looks good to you
dont mean that its good for you
all you need is real love
nowadays its hard to find

[chorus:]
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em
(see my mama told me the came exact words)
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em

[hook:]
ooooh will you
will you stay by me girl
if i lost all my money
will you
be there even when things go down
oooh yea yea yea

[chorus:]
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em
if i need somebody ? ill just open up a magazine
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em
whats the use of lookin at ya
when you cant do nuttin for me
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em
(sure cant keep em)
beauty can get em
but it sure cant keep em
(sure cant keep)

[talking:]
(yea wooaaahh)
you can be the most
finest thing on the outside
but the ugliest in the inside
feel me? aight
(beauty) see to you (can get em)
100
