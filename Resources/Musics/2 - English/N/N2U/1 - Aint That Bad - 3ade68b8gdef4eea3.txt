AINT THAT BAD

You were the one to keep my tears from falling down
By telling me I could go, no hope is gone
So I sing to you this song, yes I do
Like water flowing from the heart into the soul
You were the one, that took my heart
and mended all the broken pieces
When I was down, you picked me up
and showed me life
Now I can live
I can live because of you, I can live
I can live because of you, I can live
I can live because of you, I can live

Because of you I can live
