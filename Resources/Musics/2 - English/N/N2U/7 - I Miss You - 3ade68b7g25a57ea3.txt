I MISS YOU

[intro]
Gave me life
Gave me all my hope and dreams
Oh sweet mama
and now I realize
All the joy you’ve put inside of me
Oh

[chorus]
I miss you
And I want you to know that
I miss you
I really miss you mama
I miss you
Deep in my heart im lonely without you mama
I miss you
I want you to know

Ever since you’ve been gone
I'm feeling so alone
All by myself
I need your help mama
So many days
Memories of your face
Play a song oh..

[chorus]
I miss you
Want you to know that
(I miss you)
Sometimes the world feel like it's on my shoulders
(I miss you)
I still remember the day you said,
‘son, you’ve got to be strong’
(I miss you)
You’ve got to hold on, hold on
Now I’m holding on
(I miss you)
You put the joy in my heart
I don’t mind telling the world
(I miss you)
Everywhere I go, you always in my heart
Oh when I
(I miss you)
when I look in the mirror I see your face
And all I do is see reflections of your eyes
(I miss you)
Oh Sunday morning no,
Sunday morning make us breakfast in the morning
Oh used to sit at the table
Say our prayers together
Ohh, oh mama
(I miss you)
The tears run down my face
Cause there’s no one to take your place
(I miss you)
Oh mama, oh I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you
I miss you
