JUST MY IMAGINATIO

Each day through my window
I watch him as he passes by
And I say to myself
I'm so lucky he's my guy
To have a boy like him
Is truly a dream come true
Out of all the girls in the world
He belongs to you

Chorus:
But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me

Soon we'll be married
And raise a family
Have a cozy little place in the country
With two keiki maybe three
I tell you I can visualize now baby
It couldn't be a dream
Cause to real it all seemed

Chorus

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear lord hear my plead
Don't ever let another take his love from me
Or I will surely die
Heavenly when your arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality he doesn¬Åft even know me

Chorus
