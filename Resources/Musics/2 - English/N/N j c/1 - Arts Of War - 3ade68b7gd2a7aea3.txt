ARTS OF WAR

Verse one
First maps pulled out, welcome to our own times
Back here, we didn't encounter really on our rhymes
A group of soldiers march, i'm leading the way
Us, and other troops have to sit down, negotiate
Is it too late? crime increasing, hell's gate open
Where all the sins live, tattooed people, smoking
And drinking underage, we wanna make a change
Where we can all gather and fly the same plane
Help to sell the game, all it takes is a little gold
And for now, just simply put your mouth on hold
Cos the war could break out, worse than a revolution
Look you've already got iraq and us shooting
Paint a perfect picture, without colours included
Meditate thoroughly before we go to do this
I knew this would occur, soon as the clouds go black
I'm counting on myself there ain't no turning back
Chorus (2x)
Soldiers march, while i lead my troops and all
All occurring in the sudden arts of war
Open and pour, be yourself once more
You've been called, in the sudden arts of war
Verse two
My niggas can bang worse than an armageddon
Not killing, ever since three years in the millennium
Ready for it, as people walk, whether on streets
Keep smoking and i won't reach up to six feet
Whether soldier, general, sergeant or colonel
Going to this could put your life in terminal
Train exploded, that's the end of your little life
Yo most kids can't even get to see their wife
In the future, lawfully holding hands, mans
From boys, women from girls, understand
The full proof plan, bullet proof it won't rip
I'm not like a typical drink to sip, or lace to trip
Comes differently, whether it be in different classes
Picking up grenades, you can feel the sudden masses
We toast over mutton, after the battle is done, mammy
Recognise once more, streets are even more live
More can survive, less of us getting high
Chorus (2x)
Verse three
We can get it on just as long as you all co-operate
This i gotta take while i'm on my paper chase
Dealing with a new case, and succeed in our dreams
Officially man mostly made everything we see
Including the idea to write and the idea to read
Kids in our garden, it's time to sow another seed
40 days and 40 nights, helped my dangerous side succeed
Feel the nice breeze, brighter day, climbing up
Fat heads we're just normally told to light it up
All of my people accompany me, like a reunion
Like ink my place in this music is permanent
I am sincere, not just a duplicate black
Who may look like someone exact, the way i react
You should understand the arts of war, plus the fact that…
Chorus (2x)
104, arts of war! family tree, my man large! shari, anne-marie and their friends! d.k, represent, my man scully! h-y-d-r-o, it's out here…
