THIZZ WAT IT IZ

[chorus:]
"thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg
Thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg."

[verse: runts]
"i'm off of that super hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy,
Getting hyphy with the homeys, homeys, homeys, homeys,
I ain't keak da sneak, i ain't from the bay
I'm runts from daygo holla at me mang
Where the thizz at? yaddiddi at me
Yaddiddi holla, yaddiddi holla!
Pop one, pop two, pop three
Go stupid and let your arms swing
Get stupid, go dumb
Be a retard and have fun
One more time i ain't keak da sneak
I'm runts, i'm here to get the hood crunk . . yaddiddimean!!"

[chorus:]
"thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg
Thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg.
Go stupid, go dumb
Get hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy
Go stupid, go dumb
Get hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy."

[verse: spyd3rr]
"thizz what it is, what it was, what it do? (do?)
Imma pop a pill that will make you act a fool (fool)
Imma boost it up with my fucking 40 ounce of brew
Now where's the newports? i'm getting kinda woo-zy
We ain't from the bay, but aye mang
You know we do the same thang
They call me wand3rrz cause i wander the streets
And i don't give a fuck whoever fucking with me
Now i'm walking and tripping like i'm drunk
Aww shit i think the 40 creepin' up
Now i feel loosened up, now my thizzin' boostin' up
Now i'm running back to the homeys
Bumping up my mp3, bumping up keak the sneak
I'm back with the thizz freaks
Shouting out e.t.c.
Taking shots of hennessey
Thizzin' real crazy, now i'm feeling drama-free
Aye loc, get a couple dollars for the sunny d."

[chorus:]
"thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg
Thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg.
Go stupid, go dumb
Get hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy
Go stupid, go dumb
Get hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy."

[verse: cry]
"man i first pop a pill when i was only fourteen
30 minutes later man it felt like a dream
My eyes started winking, o.j. i'm drinking
Bottles after bottles what the fuck am i thinking?
Homeys looking at me like i was fucking strange
A couple minutes passed and my vision start to change
10 a pop guarantee that's all you need mang
I ain't from the bay but i'm from the westcoast
We got "red dolphins" "white lines" and "blue notes"
I thizz so much that i can't get enough
This shit got me horny all i wanna do is fuck
It's kinda frustrated cause my shit won't go up
Thizz what it is, what it is, where the thizz?
Fuck it mang, everyweek we thizz
Thizz what it is, what it is, where the thizz?
Thizz what it is, what it is."
Runts: "where the thizz?"

[chorus: x2]
"thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg
Thizz what it is thi-thizz what it is
Roll up a blunt and smoke a cigg.
Go stupid, go dumb
Get hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy
Go stupid, go dumb
Get hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy."
