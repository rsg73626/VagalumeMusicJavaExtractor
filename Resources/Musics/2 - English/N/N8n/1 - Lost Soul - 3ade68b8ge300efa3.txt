LOST SOUL

When I got out of the shower
Somethin' hit me in my head
The sound of the man tellin' me
The story I haven' read

Next thing I know
I'm in the kitchen writin' down
It's the song I always wanted to write
Now I guess it's comin' along

Mama don't preach,
Soul intense tell me what I wanna know
Saw the plane jumped on board
When I was six years old

Now I'm a little bit older still
They same time is on your side
There's nothin' I can do or say about it
I'm gonna turn it inside out

Spend my life in the past time
Always thinkin' of you
Tell myself its a new day
Can you hear me am I comin' thru

Refrain:
I'm just a lost soul waitin' for a call
Waitin' for a time mine
Why don't you take me back now baby
Singin' blue blot no no no
How I miss the James Brown
With the funky sound
Don't you miss that good ol' soul
How can I forget myself
When all I wanna do is grow

I've been thinkin'
What you want for me
Got all my life ahead,
I'm not about to follow thy

I can't let you go, I can't let you win,
You probably hold on to eat time
But I guess its time I blow your mind
I'll do it every time

I know it's gettin' old
While my body's turnin' cold
Where your goin' I don't mind girl
As long as you know where I'm comin' from
Gone dance the night away

Refrain

I've got a hit babe, so just hit me!
