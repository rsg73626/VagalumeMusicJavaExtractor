SPACIOUS THOUGHTS

Intro (Kool Keith)
Yeah! This is a national message! 
N.A.S.A. worldwide! One...Take the spotlight off me. 
(take the spotlight of me)

Verse(Kool Keith)
I remember when the Cubans was first on Broadway.
With dark and yellow gold,
I was 11 years old.
The inspiration was spread out like a blanket, ask em'.
My discovery was beyond the pick, the Lee suit, and the afro.
Now from the flair jeans on 169th and College.
Watching the dude lean on one-seven-o
With a Kangol 'cross America,
I saw the hippies cross.
By Herc on Technique needles syncopated time was on time,
The same time as the Beatles.
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed withJolly
Ranchers.
when the NFL had the Rams in Los Angeles,
Charles Finley in Oakland,
And my kindergarten moment was the beginning.
'Til the Caribbean people came to New York and sheepskin
was bought,
The wind breaker

Chorus(Tom Waits & Kool Keith)
The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town(spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block(spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well(spacious thoughts)

Verse(Tom Waits)
The balloon drops down at midnight
stranglin' the monkey with the hands of a clock
Good can't help but do a little Evil
Evil can't help but,
do a little Good.
Who's that singing in the kitchen by the stove?
All aboard for the night train!
they say the moon, it smells just like a cherry bomb.
Come on home,
all is forgiven.
Everything costs.
Deliver us from evil,
and carry your own cross.

Chorus(Tom Waits & Kool Keith)
The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town(spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block(spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well(spacious thoughts)

Bridge(Kool Keith)
The time gathered with poppy seeds and grass,
Growing nobody faster than Jesse Owens.
With everything I'm seeing and knowing.
London Heathrow,
Walking through the airport with green Pro-Keds
Sixty-niners from the designers,
Tom McCann above the hill,
Next to my man, Lou Man,
The cardigan sweaters,
The still sell the New Eras now at Jew Man!
Bridge cont.(Tom Waits)
Ghetto Bhudda in the second set,
Breaking out in a cold sweat.
I'll meet you in the music.
We meet in the music,
those we never met.
Keep dancing like there's nobody watching
Everyone can win the toss.
I may wander, bit I am never lost.

Chorus(Tom Waits & Kool Keith)
The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town(spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block(spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well(spacious thoughts)
