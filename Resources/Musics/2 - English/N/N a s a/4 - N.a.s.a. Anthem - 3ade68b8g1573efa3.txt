N.A.S.A. ANTHEM

Some way, when these 2 americans stepped on the moon
The people of this world were brought closer together
And it is that spirit, the spirit of apollo
That transcends geographical barriers and political differences
It can bring the people of the world together in peace...

To our friends, all our friends, let's begin to extend
As we grow with the whole universe, we expand
