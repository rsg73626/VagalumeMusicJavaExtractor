GIFTED

KANYE WEST:
I'm known for running my mouth
I will not be accountable for what comes out, uh
I dunno, I might have said it
I was kinda gone and light-headed
And my jacket kinda fresh bright reded
And as usual my pants tight-threaded.
It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit.
Don't get it twisted it or dreaded it
I am the king and will not beheaded,
To the mall no time soon, brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin,
That'll only get my engine revvin'.
While y'all on ten, I'm on eleven.
I'ma make the news, be on at seven.
Matter fact I'm on this very second.
I'm in first and y'all in second.
And this verse only add to the freshness.
Call the club, tell them add to the guest list.
What you think? Way more bitches?
I can never be too big for my britches.
Y'all muthafuckas know who this is.
I'm gifted,
Merry Christmas...
Merry Christmas.

LYKKE LI & SANTOGOLD:
I'm armed with pens, and I got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time

SANTOGOLD:
You don't know my mind
Like I said a thousand times
I gotta stay ahead
Know what I'm fighting for
I leave you to your talk
Never seen my kind before
And you're all so thick-headed
Follow and I know I let it
Part of me won't let me quit
Won't let me just not say shit
So much is there to be bored with
Can't be still, I can't afford it
Try to hold it in but it make me sick,
So I spit it out say the hell with it
I dream it and I build it tall
Make a way for when it falls
