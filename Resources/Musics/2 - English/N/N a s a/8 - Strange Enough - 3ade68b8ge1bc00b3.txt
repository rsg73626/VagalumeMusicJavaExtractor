STRANGE ENOUGH

Verse: (ODB)

Toe to toe, I scrap with the best
If I spit 10 rhymes, nigga 9 gonna connect
If you ain't from the 102, I respect
Cause I probably just forgot, I'm rolling strictly from my set
Wu-Tang, man I love my set
Niggas coming up here cause this is where the cheese at
Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You'se a naive cat if you still believe that, for real
That's some shit to try to keep you where you at
All content while niggas driving Bentleys and Maybachs
Think I'ma laid back playa? Forget it, first 
100 G's I see nigga I'm tryin to flip it (hell yeah)
And that's some real shit, not just some lyrics
I gotta couple open cases, not too specific
Niggas out here tryin to prove who's the realest
It's ok to pop shit, but come a little different

Chorus: (Karen O)

Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, 
y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change...
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, 
y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enoguh to change...

Verse: (FatLip)

Wild boy, cow bow, entertainer, insane, purple rainer
Musical genius, smoke the greenest, 
35 trying to survive like I mean this
Amped up with a whole lotta watts
Beats bang like a whole lotta shots
In the gun range
Strange as they come, Underground don-da-da number one
Bang this orangutan, jungle funk, trouble funk
Double shot vodka on the rocks star drunk
Rock n Roll songs belong to blues singers
So peep this song that we sing, ya

Verse: (ODB)

Young and started, but I had a talent

To give this pack a jump, but I took it as a challenge
So older niggas gave me much as i could handle
Cop the eagle, started jacking with the green New Balance shit
Feeling clean, I was only 13
With the heavy starch on my Bugle Boy jeans
My name spelled out on my 4 finger ring
It was Dirt then, cause Mcgirt you ain't seen...

Chorus: (Karen O)

Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, 
y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change...
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, 
y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enoguh to change...

Verse: (FatLip)

Yo, the truth hurts, I'm addicted to shit I don't need
Weed, yayo nosebleeds
Please don't remind me
The hoes that grind me, strip club, late night, gettin grimy
Freak show, panty lover
But I'm gettin too old for this like Danny Glover
Nah, bump that, gimme some more, let's go
Ozzy Osbourne when I perform the flow, yo,
I'm old school set in my ways. 
Set Blaze to the track N.A.S.A. made
Ain't lost my touch, ride til the wheels fall, no clutch
Just stick to the script n' dip, 
Dirt and Lip, get them chips like 
Erik Estrada, coming with the silent product
It's FatLip and Dirt Dog and N.A.S.A. for all y'all, hoooo

Chorus: (Karen O)

Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, 
y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change...
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, 
y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enoguh to change...
