My bedro call me over
Like 'where you been my brotha?
What they got you unda?
How's it been I wonda?'
Can't keep you dreams jus' like me
They brush me off then bite me
When I make some money then hike me;
Can not pump this like me
Burn that bridge then white meat
Now these girls they like me
Lemme get no nerd no pussy
Goin' straight to they head like books meet
I take it on like Cooksey
Wait a second that's homegirl callin' me
"Hey girl, I been waitin all day for you"

Don't be gettin all loose on bluetooth

Sayin' eat my ass like you do
Or take it in the ass like you do 
Cuz where you been, safe haven?
Make them as my skin
And they got this room around me cuz the box they put me in
They want they fast
Hey girl, I got nooses round my neck
They gon' knock this shed from under me for reasons you'll regret
How you gon' dance? put ya leg up
Go head girl, put ya leg up
Go head girl, put ya leg up
Go head girl, put ya leg (like this)
