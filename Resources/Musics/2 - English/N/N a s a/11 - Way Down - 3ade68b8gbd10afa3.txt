WAY DOWN

BARBIE HATCH (JOHN FRUSCIANTE):
A little boy from under the ground
He said, "Girl, won't you come on down
To my way of thinking?
California is sinking
It won't be long now"

Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)

All of my loves, they're gathering dust
To the woods with my cold heart, he is gone
His eyes were like fire
I burst like a star

Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)

A little boy from under the ground
He said, "Girl, you're mine now
And you're turning away from this burning
It's all over now"

RZA:
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Underground king
Only heard and not seen
Therefore, I exist in the deepest of your dreams
No exaggeration
You trapped in my infatuation
I'm like a wiretapping, strapping your imagination
Years of love, tears of blood
You was up the club, like beers and drugs
Now I'm trapped in limbo with your golden fist symbol
See the soul?
Use my eyes for a window
Only death, I can escape from this loneliness
The assault of your love is felonious
It was the kiss that broke my narcissist
Still, I run this earth like the prison?

BARBIE HATCH (JOHN FRUSCIANTE):
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
Don't ask me where I've been (way down)
