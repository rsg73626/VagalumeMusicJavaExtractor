We used to roll out with the thunder sound and beats and rhythms and gather round in the cypher to get down give it all you got nigga putting your shit down but nowadays it's funny how they don't say shit no power to the people pioneering the ship ripping the main frame aiming to get a hold of these chips from anonymous tips, keeping that hip hop even when the needle skips and inject soul affection like collagen lips polishing perfect for the circuit as the cadillac dips lacing the track makes you want to take it back what? I didn't know you boys was gonna rock that shit like that what some skills we never lack when you got hot shit they wanna ride piggyback but when you lack, everything fades to black and that's hip hop, it'll drive you crazy say what, say what? (baby,baby)
