BACK HOME

You know I feel about you love to make things grow
I know I have been such an idiot to the world
There is no reason to avoid me anymore
I´ve learned that feelings in our hearts just come and go


I´ll come back home... and it´s today
I´ll come back home because of you, so won´t you stay?
I´ll come back home... maybe it´s too late
I´ll come back home to free and give myself away


I´m tired to live like a rider on the road
It´s been while since I left you on your own
But now I´m so ashamed (for) I´ve lived this way
I realized that life without you is not the same


We don´t need to find another place to go
I´m here to say to you that I want to be back home
´Cause we got something to share
