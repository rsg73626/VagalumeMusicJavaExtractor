MORNING NEWS

I heard the morning news
It´s about what´s coming soon
I´m waiting for the day that will be mine

My life will turn in two
You know! These things are cool
I´m waiting for the day that will be mine

You need to realize that we have to care about the world and things we do
I heard the morning news and my friend I want you to come
