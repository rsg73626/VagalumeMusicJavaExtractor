DESTINY

Come to me my angel i got something for you
I have no fear ´cause I wanna know the truth
Don´t be afraid of my anger excuse
You´ll be laughing by the time you get used

There is no conscience from where i´ve been
They just put fire in things we believe
I got one question to set me free

Angel, Angel Can you see me?
Angel, Angel Don´t go away
Angel, Angel Can you feel me?
Are you my destiny?

My world is violent since i was born
Human differences has turned into war
Where is the patience when you disagree
We have been fighting unconsciesly

If there´s no silence inside your soul
Release your hunger on things you´re here for
I got one question before i go
