LAY DOWN IN YOUR ARMS

When I know... I feel that day is coming soon
When I see that your love it´s also true
When I know what you share I just can´t live without you

When I feel that my heart is just like you
And all that´s real begins to turn from grey to blue
When I know that you care I´m sure I can trust on you

And my mind,

Lay down in your arms
Just to reach my soul
I live my life for you / And I´ve been walking through
It´s all that I can do / the way down to your heart


When I know that my voice is out of tune
Oh I´m sure! This kind of thing only you would do
When I know that it´s rare to love and be no fool

When I know what you share I just can´t live without you
