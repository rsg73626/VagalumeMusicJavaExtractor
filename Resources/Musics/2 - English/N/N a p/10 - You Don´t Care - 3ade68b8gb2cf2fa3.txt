YOU DON´T CARE

Our life was like a dream
We were sounds of the same string
But now i can not understand
How it came to an end

I´m still searching for our love
´Cause baby, the things were good
I tried to keep you inside of me
But you, didn´t keep me inside of you

I told you once, I told you twice
You are the love of my life
You used to say that to me too
And i´m the one that´s missing you

You don´t care (4x)
REFRÃO: You´re never there

I gave up to say that i care
´Cause you were not there
And please remember, ´cause this is true
When i say: I love you

I´m quite sure i will forget
The day we have met
Even in our first date
You showed up there very late


Oh baby!, my girl
Turn to me and listen
Don´t you come to my heart
And see how it beats blues?
