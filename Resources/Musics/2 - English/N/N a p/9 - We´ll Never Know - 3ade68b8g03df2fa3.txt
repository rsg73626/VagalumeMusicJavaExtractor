WE´LL NEVER KNOW

Who knows what you will find
If you really got time to change my mind
Who holds the life for me? I guess we´ll never know
Who cares about the madness
If we all have a little bit
Who found this open book? I guess we´ll never know

Who came for the first time
On Earth it matters for we feel fine
Who cried all those tears? I guess we´ll never know
I beg for you and for me
Let´s live our lives with no hate
Who tries to hit our heads? I guess we´ll never know


I got this feeling in my heart, I won´t be a fool 
And I´ll do everything, I´ll do everything for you
As the years go by life will gets me through
And when I come to you I´ll say everything´s true


Who shows all of your soul
Is not afraid of losing control
Who lies about the truth? I guess we´ll never know
My fears are running in my skin
I got no choice I´m washing my sins
Who fakes your own dream? I guess we´ll never know
