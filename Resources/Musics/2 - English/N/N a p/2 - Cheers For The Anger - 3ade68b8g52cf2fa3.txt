CHEERS FOR THE ANGER

I´m a man who works everyday
´Cause that´s the price we have to pay
I´m feeling that i´m losing all my faith
Oh God! Can you believe in that?
I live my life worried about mistakes
I know I´ve made a lot of them
It´s my request I ain´t gonna take a rest
Until the time has fade away

All the tears that we have cried will disappear...


Hey! I wanna hear you say: “Cheers for the anger”
There is no other way: “Cheers for the anger” 


There was a time that i believed in shame
It´s good to feel I´m not the same
And I´ve been wrong about what make us strong
We got to do what we say
For all these years I´ve stucked myself here
I know I´ve waited for too long
I won´t be down, I just won´t let them win
´Cause all I want is not be wrong

All the tears that we have cried will disappear...
