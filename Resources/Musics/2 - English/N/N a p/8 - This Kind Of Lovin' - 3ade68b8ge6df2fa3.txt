THIS KIND OF LOVIN'

This kind of lovin´
I heard the news
This kind of lovin´ baby!
It feels like I´m lucky baby!
That kind of lovin´
I´ve been used
This kind of lovin´ baby!
Your kind of lovin´ hurts no more


There you are laughing out loud
Turning my life to upside-down
Your pretty face comes like an arrow to my soul
I´m thinking: “That´s the one for sure” 
Here I am just so unused
Women thoughts are so confuse
Your simple flame burns like a bomb into my world
I´m ready for losing control

I´m feeling that somethings are wrong
Some mistakes don´t come along
Your wicked words seems like you did these things before
Careless ways it´s all you show
Tears ain´t gonna change my mind
How could you be so unkind
I realized that I could live just on my own
So that´s why I sing this song
