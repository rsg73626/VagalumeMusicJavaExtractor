TOOK IT ALL AWAY

Everytime me and you on the case
You never seem to let me get a word in
You tell me things like
Imagine if you walked through the door 
And you see me with another man 
You'd throw him throught the curtain

I understand that your hurting
But everywhere I go
Girls love flirting
I want to let you know I'm another person
I called and I called
But it kept diverting

See you lied, and I cried 
Now how am I supposed to forgive you?
Baby, you traitor
Tell me how many times did you think I'd stay?
 
You took it all away,
Why did you have to do this now?
I'm feeling so empty
There's nothing left in me to say
But you should be here right now
I feel you within me
I'm hoping you ring me one day

Everytime you was with another girl
You knew it was me that you'd be hurting
So don't pretend you don't know that I mean
Coz through your phone babe I've been searching
So now you know that it's curtains
You're the one that got with another person
Now look at me, I'm the one that's flirting
And now when you call I just keep diverting

See you lied, and I cried 
Now how am I supposed to forgive you?
Baby, you traitor
Tell me how many times did you think I'd stay?
 
You took it all away,
Why did you have to do this now?
I'm feeling so empty
There's nothing left in me to say
But you should be here right now
I feel you within me
I'm hoping you ring me one day

Now I know all you ever wanted was a little bit of respect
But I'm a man and you know how we get 
Head in my hands, switching in the mirror
Because I never thought
 I would be the one chasing when we meet

You never showed that you wanted me for the scrilla
Even though I know you love it when we fuck in the villa
And now you're so far away, night feels like days
Got me staying awake, so alive I wanna kill her

Is it so hard to understand I hate living without you
No one has ever made me feel so low
You're pushing in the knife so slow

There you go, now you know
How I felt when we were together 

You took my life and turned it upside down
If only karma didn't come back around
But I guess it's over now, over now

You took it all away,
Why did you have to do this now?
I'm feeling so empty
There's nothing left in me to say
But you should be here right now
I feel you within me
I'm hoping you ring me one day
