SECRETS

Dappy turn my mike up

Today is the day that I'm gonna tell
Just a little 'bout myself
All of these haters they don't understand me
They can't touch the pain I felt

I wish I could show them all of my secrets
And they might see through me
But if I tell my secrets or expose my weakness
I can let 'em tear through me

Mummy had problems, daddy couldn't solve them
Won't stop they just add to her pain
Daddy it's okay, I still love you
Because you show me love in every way

Mummy I'm sorry for not always caring
I got so lost when you weren't around
Since I was a young girl I kept us related
I don't trust so I won't get let down

So who could be behind my smile
I'm crying out and I'm left without a hand

T, no you ain't, you can tell us anything
We'll advise you in every way
One more thing, for those who don't know we is family
We've known each other since we were babies

So I guess it's just another one of them days
I got bills to pay, studez to rent
Girl problems plus an album due within nine days

Stress to the brain, mumsie's going through so much pain
Every time I get paid money to Elaine
One more and you'll open you eyes to a blacked out range

Gunshots, knife attacks
Seems like I'm living in a life of attacks
Government bills, dogdgy deals
Leads to another life, crime on wheels

I'm so broke that it's no joke
Surrounded by addicts who be on coke
If I really wanted to I make money off them
Block in the morning on the move by ten

I write them hits in my head
Don't need no time for paper and pen
I sell my demos in boxes of ten
Won't stop me unless you're a dirty bill

It's like yesterday
Fifteen hooded up thirteen years olds in Westie
Were the bester days can you relate
Young black boys from council estates

Rolling around the ends twenty man strong
Pour some Hennessey for every man gone
I know I ain't sent no letters but still
Free hash, free deal, I'm not for much longer

Ever since I was a young and I found it hard to find my way
Thats why I don't trust, so I won't get let down

So who could be behind my smile
I'm crying out, I'm left without a hand

T, no you ain't, you can tell us anything
We'll advise you in every way
One more thing, for those who don't know we is family
We've known each other since we were babies

Oh, I went from not wanting to live life no more
To appreciating every breath I take
If it wasn't for the music I probably won't be here
That's why I pray to God every day

Dreaming of days when I could just fly away
I'm trying to stay strong but after today I'm feeling down
So who could be behind my smile
I'm crying out, I'm left without a hand
