MISSING YOU

Ooohh yeeeahh
Oooohh

I remember the time
When i saw your face for the last time
It was like id never cried so much in my life before
I know ur watching us;

She had a smile that was so neat
Had a voice that was so sweet
I even used to like it when she kissed me on the cheek
I really used to love it when we chilled on the beach whilst
Listening to beats
It was funny takin a drag of her fag blazin at the sun
Always lookin out for me like i was your son
Picturing the state of your mum
Knowin she lost her only daughter that never made it to 21
It all started on friday 13th up in the cafe
Tryin to persuade you to come for a drink
But you was persistent to stay
I could tell by the look in your eyes
Something was moving the wrong way
So unfortunalty you decided to climb on the back of your mans bike
To go on a ride whilst he was out of his head
You shoulda been here instead
But it is to late your already lying dead
In a hospital bed.

Now help me ive said goodbye
A very special young girl
Whos life have just been taken away
And ive grown to realize
Apprieciate its your life
That can be taken that day

Ive been thinkin bout all of these tradgies
This life this group has me
And ive just been wasting away
Everytime that i think about the way you died
My chest was just so tight i wanna break down and cry
Somethings really wrong inside
No no wooo

My friend, i never thought id say goodbye
Somebody tell me whyyy
We had to loose you like this
My friend, i never thought id say goodbye
Somebody tell me whyyy
We're missing you? we're missing you? ohh

Yoyoyo i still think about the past
Last summer by the tree where we played the guitar
And had a drink and a laugh
And after that you would lay down and show me the stars
But then 12 months later
You left me messages
Scared to hear that you passed
I cried so many tears so hard it broke my heart
Knowin that we cried on the same binge with 2 kids
Dib on your way to buy a pack of cigs
But

If only youuu (if only you would listen when we told you our plans)
You wouldnt beee (where you are right now,6 feet underground)
Yoohooo would get a 2nd chance (yeah,all that would be forgotton
Send you back to this earth where you deserve and by the way
Heres somethin that we wrote for your 21st)
Yeah

Everytime i think about the way you died
My chest goes so tight i wanna break down and cry
Somethings really wrong inside
No no no wooo

My friend, i never thought id say goodbye
Somebody tell me whyyy
