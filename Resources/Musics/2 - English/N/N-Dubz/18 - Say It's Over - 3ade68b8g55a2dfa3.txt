SAY IT'S OVER

I ain't Gunna Lie
You Were Number One Then
But I don't Feel The Same no More
I Just Want You As A Friend
I'm Done Trying To Pretend

They Say Good Things Don't Last Forever
Someday They Gotta End
And a Matter Of Fact
I'm Doing You A Favour
If Done Of Fkin Girls
And Coming Back To You Later
And I'm Sick Of Deleteing Everthing in My Pager,

Baby I'm Not Britney
But I'm Dropping Of Ya' Radar
She Wonders Why I Never Pick Up My Phone,
Cos All I'm Trying To Do Is Keep It On The Low.
I Think I need To Let Her Know Before She Finds Out On Her Own,
Either Way I'm Going To Break Her Heart When I Tell Her go.
All My Ppl Around The World If You Like Somebody Else,

How Do You Find The Words To Say Its Over?
I Been Wanting To Tell You,
But I Dunno How To Tell You.
How Do you Find The Words To Tell Them Its Over?
Baby Its Killing Me
This Just Isnt Right For Me,
I Think I like Somebody Else.
I ain't Gunna Lie
But You Were Number One
But It Just ain't The Same Anymore
Your Out of My Top Ten

This ain't Good For Your Health
And Only If You Knew
That Everytime I'm Fkin You
I Think Of Somebody Else.
I Knew one Of Us Was Gunna Get Hurt
From The Get Go I Told You I Told You I Said So

I Hate Having To Fake The Feeling
Every time We Get Low,
I think its Better For Us Both
If We Let Go
She Wonders Why I'm Never Round These Days,
As Soon As I touch Base
She'll Be All Up In My Face
Its The Same Old **** She Never Gives Me Any Space,

How Do I Tell Her Someones Taking Her Place?
