it was nothing but a quick think 
kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling 
now I'm hoping you never go missing 
now i'm telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens 

it was done as quick as the wind blows 
didn't think i would ever be involved 
so i even wrote a song called 'don't go' 
now its just you and me on a love row 

Dappy like dino us two tip toes duck dive get low 
and now i care less about who knows 
now we're deep in way past intro dappy explain yo 

[BRIDGE][DAPPY] 
see never did i think a boy like me would be in need 
when all i really wanted was to have some fun 
now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing 
you're number one 

[CHORUS] 
see i don't understand how you're number one 
when it was just a fling before now, you're the one 
see all i did was blink twice, from my homie to my only 
number one 

ah uh uh oh 
ah uh uh oh 
ah uh uh oh 
ah uh uh oh 

[TINCHY] 
yo 
it was all now never planned no after 
it was like games jokes laughter 
live for the moment, left it all open 
now i'm in deep, flames, lava, breathe, karma 

and now i'm stating, see i never saw this in my daydream 
its really you that i'm fully rating 
and the days here no more waiting 

pay it all wise to the smart man raised him 
i was so hurt, pain, aching 
on the wrong path then a good girl saved him 
that's why I'm letting her know she's amazing 

[BRIDGE][DAPPY] 
see never did i think a boy like me would be in need
