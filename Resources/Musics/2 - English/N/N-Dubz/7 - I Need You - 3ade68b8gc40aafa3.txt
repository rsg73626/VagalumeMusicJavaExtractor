I NEED YOU

Baby i need you
I need ya
I need you
I need ya

Last night was a blur,but all i remember is, Black Shirt, bare carats on my wrist
Me and a couple men rollin' up in a whip 
Met a pretty young lady, should i say bitch
Will i ever see you again
Always thinkin' of another man's riches
Why do you do this to us men
And that's why we call them bitches
See i don't understand, she wasn't with a man
How could i leave without a number in my hand
I went to go on Facebook
Will i get a face back
Trying to find you is like a needle in a haystack

I came so close
You touched my body
You left me standing like a statue, baby i need you

I was missing yesterday
I'm pissed i never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm going mad, i need you
i been searching all over Facebook
And i can't seem to find you
I really have to find you 
Baby i need you

I need ya
I need you
I need ya

Oh oh, oh, oh oh

last night i met a fella
he made me feel so, oh oh oh
That can mean what you want it to mean
Popped to the ladies for a sec(Uh, I'll be back in five,yeh?)
But when i came back out he left(i felt so alone)
He left me standin in my LBD and my bang bang shoes 
I was so confused

I came so close
you touched my body
You left me standing like a statue
baby i need you

I was missing yesterday
I'm pissed i never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm going mad, i need you
i been searching all over Facebook
And i can't seem to find you
I really have to find you 
Baby i need you

See now i gotta find someone like you
You ain't gonna find someone like me
Someone tell me what the hell I should do
Will i ever find someone just like you
(I don't think so)
Not quite like me, girl,you're one in a million 
(I'm one in a million)

Yo, what do i do
I need to find you girl
Cause you could be the one to make a change in my world
Maybe one day i'll put a ring around your finger
You should try bein' with a singer
And do you know the meaning of a stark in jail 
Until we meet again, my heart's on bail
Wherever you are right now 
I just wanna let you know...

You're my looove
I was missing yesterday
I'm pissed i never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm going mad, i need you
i been searching all over Facebook
And i can't seem to find you
I really have to find you 
Baby i need you

See now i gotta find someone like you
You ain't gonna find someone like me
Someone tell me what the hell I should do
Will i ever find someone just like you
(I don't think so)
Not quite like me, girl,you're one in a million 

I need you
I need ya   2x
Baby i need you
i need ya
i need you
i need ya
