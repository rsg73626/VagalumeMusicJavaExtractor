BEST BEHAVIOUR

[Dappy]
Drag my bags off the plane today,
A little too much fun on tour.
Lord please help me find my keys,
or im banging down my own door.
All the cheering, all the applause,
who could ask for more?
Now I wouldn’t mind finding a real thing ready when my bags finally hit the floor.

See i need some kind of lady, that will feed me daily,
every time i come home she’ll be waiting for me.
cuz i been thinking lately, that life alone is crazy,
I wanna hold somebody when i sleep.

[Hahaahaaa]

Who's gonna be the one to save me?
Will i ever settle down, all i do is run around,
This is taking too long.

[Chorus]
Love is all i need, I’ve waited all my life,
Love is all i need, I’ve waited all my life,
You got me on my best behaviour, ohh uuaah ohhh
Hurry up im in danger baby, ohh uuaah ohhh
how long before you save me baby?

[Tulisa]
I just finished the tour today, and my bags dropped to my door,
walked up to an empty room and now im crying on my own floor,
All the bright lights and all the surprises, tell me what they mean,

If im standing on a stage infront so many people and i feel like its just me,
see i need some kind of man that can understand me.
They’ll be no bosses who i will have to be. Sometimes i get lonely.
I just need to hold me. then i might let them be the boss of me

[Hahaahaaa]

Who's gonna be the one to save me?
Will i ever settle down, all i do is run around,
This is taking too long.

Love is all i need, I’ve waited all my life,
Love is all i need, I’ve waited all my life,
You got me on my best behaviour, ohh uuaah ohhh
Hurry up im in danger baby, ohh uuaah ohhh
How long before you save me baby?

[Fazer]
cause im down heer, caged in
burnt out, aching
seen it all before done with all the heartbreaking
cause im fed up, lonely
no longer the old me
right now could do with some company
i need someone to call me codey
your taking to long come on hurry up come to the rescue
fly away with me and hold me
i’ll cherish you like a trophy
if I don’t know how to be than show me
where are you down here is a no go
I can’t keep on riding solo
I don’t want to wait “all my life”
like sailes K-Ci and JoJo

[Hahaahaaa]

Love is all i need, I’ve waited all my life,
Love is all i need, I’ve waited all my life,
You got me on my best behaviour, ohh uuaah ohhh
Hurry up im in danger baby, ohh uuaah ohhh
How long before you save me baby?
How long before you save me baby? 

how long before you save me baby? [3x]
