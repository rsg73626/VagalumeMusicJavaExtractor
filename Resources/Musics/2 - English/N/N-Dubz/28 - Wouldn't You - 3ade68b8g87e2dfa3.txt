WOULDN'T YOU

Na Na Naii 
Oh Na Na Noww 

[Tulisa] 
[Verse 1] 
Said Boy ive been seeing you for quite a while 
And I needa confess express what you do to me 
I need to tell you 
About the way you've changed my life 
So many beautiful nights your the reason 
Youve got me staying ha ha through the night 
See the thing is.. 

[Chorus] 
I don't quite understand 
What you're trying to say (straight up) 
Can you make it clearer? 
and I just want you nearer 
See everyone around me keeps on saying that 
I must be blind (well they do have a point) 
Shut up! 

All im tryin got say is that 
Wouldn't you wouldn't you 
like to have me to yourself 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
what if I was to break your heart 
who would be dumb enough to 
lose all that I have got for you 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
you've got to finish what you start 

haha I can give you that haha 
let me give you that hahahahaha 

na na naii 
oo na na noww 

[Dappy] 
I like when you wear them material things 
But I like it more when you try my hat on with the strings 
And do the impression on me when I say na na naii 
I aint gonna lie no more you must have done a lot 
For the body and the back and the brain that youve got 
It's simple if I start I wont stop 
Youre so intelligent with such a high IQ 
So if I ever have a baby id love it to be with you 

[Faze] 
The way she smiles at me every time she sees me its crazy 
Im proud to call her my lady 
Like daps said, she the type of I girl I wanna see holding my baby 
And she don't get excited whenever my job pays me 
But if im on the phone she don't act right 
So I try to keep them well away 
So I don't have to stop a catfight 
Cant say I never said I wasn't that type 
Truly you really confuse me 
And thats why 

[Chorus] 
I don't quite understand 
What you're trying to say (are you mad as) 
Can you make it clearer? 
and I just want you nearer 
See everyone around me keeps on saying that 
I must be blind (you must be blind)(i dont understand) 
shut up! 

All im tryin got say is that 
Wouldn't you wouldn't you 
like to have me to yourself 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
what if I was to break your heart 
who would be dumb enough to 
lose all that I have got for you 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
you've got to finish what you start 

haha I can give you that haha 
let me give you that hahahahaha 

na na naii 
oo na na noww 

[Dappy] 
Whatever what would a girl like you want from a rebel like me? 
Got no money in the bank just stuck in a council estate ?? 

[Tulisa] 
Together, will get abit closer to the dream 
lets fly away just you and me so its up to you 

[chorus] 
Wouldn't you wouldn't you 
like to have me to yourself 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
what if I was to break your heart 
who would be dumb enough to 
lose all that I have got for you 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
you've got to finish what you start 

haha Wouldn't you wouldn't youlike to have me to yourself 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
what if I was to break your heart 
who would be dumb enough to 
lose all that I have got for you 
all to myself 
all to yourself 
you've got to finish what you start 

haha I can give you that haha 
let me give you that hahahahaha
