BETTER NOT WASTE MY TIME

(oh oh, oh oh) (na na ni) (oooh na na) 
Like first things first you probably think Im a chap with good manners, 
well your wrong im the scum of the earth, 
Im the worst of the worst and I aint boasting bout my verses, 
Im speakin bout the way i run around snatchin purses, (gimmie dat) 
coz every meaning has a purpose, 
just because I never went to school it dont mean i cant be perfect, 
We're screaming out loud, wes addicted to money like two fingers tapping on where-ever theres a vain 
and believe me yea we're proud coz life is gettin sicker by the day and therefore we'll always stick around 
Tonight you'll see the size of me, 
You wouldn't think Im any harm init, 
Think again Ill take your wallet and nicely, chat up your wife to be 
Middle class daddys girl I think i need to get me one and your one looks just right for me 
So come on you want to fight with me, 
Might as well be polite to me, 
Unless you want to deal with 15 ruffed up 
I've bin thru too much but its not right for me 
Sit you down and remove all your designer garments off you silently, 
So i suggest somewhere else and try to impress coz deep beneath the decks you aint never gettin respect 
I mean last night i had a dream that i was rich as hell 
But the sik thing is i was acting like a b***h as well 
Isnt it funny how money can make alot of people change 
You think your my friend but im telling you, you aint 

(chorus) 
You better not waste my time 
I got better things on my mind 
I need to leave jerks like you behind 
cause all they ever do is bring me down 
So...would you let me be 
I'll make you dissapear 
When you hear the word money thats the only time you ever interfear 
I tohught that you was there, (na na) 
but i guess im wrong, 
why would you care 

(girl) 
I remember once upon a time when i was just thirteen 
So innocent and given everyone would act like they loved me 
Then all the bitchin and rumours began 
seems like i didnt have any friends 
So much hate lies and deceit 
caused by all their jealousy 
Now do you bitches really think im the same girl i used to be 
Do you really think i would back down from you hoes if you try to bring it to me 
I know your hating coz your man keeps watchin but im neither wantin 
so tell him stop gawkin 
the more you hate i get closer to my goal 
you'll wake up as nothing at 20 years old 

(repeat chorus) 

(boy rapping again) 
Do you remember them days when i didnt hav no rhymes 
practising my verse in the class til it was home time 
I never used to pay attention at school, 
was playing penny up the wall or in detention with fools 
All the teachers used to doubt me 
used to say i wouldnt make it in my music just to see me get rowdy 
so i could switch in the classroom for an excuse to kick me out 
no wonder why im bunking all my lessons in the bathrooms 
Now im starving hungry working hard for this super stardom life 
bin kind of hard for me to try and make it right 
and its hard to decide whether i should leave behind all my peeps in this life 
to move forward and seek what i find 
This life is leathal,like a baby being born addicted to crack 
so much evil in people 
someone said it first so i guess that im the sequel 
Just because im black it dont mean i cant be equal 
For screaming out loud wes addicted to mics like to norstrils (sniffs) like where-ever there's some coke 
because lifes been sick from day one and therefore its only going to get harder 
I love my nike airs but know im moving on to gucci and prada 
Used to looking rugged but a tux looks smarter 
I know you dont know me 
I know you aint my codie, but theres nothing on these streets that you can ever try and show me 

(repeat chorus X3) 

(girl) 
(oh oh, oh oh) 
two thousand and sexy 

(boy rapping) 
no time for wastein this one is for them backstabbers who werent around when we had nothing 
who always seem to interfear when they hear the word money 
money? 
what you wana fiver? 
get the hell outta here son 
cough 
get out 
hahaha yeah
