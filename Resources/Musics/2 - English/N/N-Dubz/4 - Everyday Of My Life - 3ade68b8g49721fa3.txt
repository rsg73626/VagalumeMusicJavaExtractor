EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE

Na na ni, oohh na na now, haha yeah

Chorus
We're in it from morning to night, someones always going down now, im feeling the shots, the dealers the cops, always seem to be circeling round town, everyday of my life, i see the same for everyday, i mean breedas getting stabbed and mothers snorting off their prams ooohh ooohh ooohh

You see this life it aint a joke, where im from you get 13 year old boys on the side of the road snorting coke, with no guidence, so many kids dying over unprovocted violence,we dont understand the science, and the rich wanna know why theres so much crime in the youths today, coz they got nowhere to go, and nowhere to play,like the kid in the classroom shouting out right answers, the kid like being heard, and the kid says the learning starts burning, he aint certain, now hes standing on the side of the curb, trying to make a profit off herb, he's only 13, chopping up a third of a ki, but by the way hes going e1 into 23, coz he dont care about the circumstances, only thing he ever cares about is when the herb inhanses, then he got moved up like half a ki, when to his olders got a piece so he could finish the beef, its crazy how shit can escalate from practically nothing, to like 25 roughed up breeder ni**as scuffin, but the bad thing was the boy that started the beef, with grime gun to his marg, 4 missing teeth

Chorus
We're in it from morning to night,someones always going down now, im feeling the shots, the dealers the cops, always seem to be circeling round town, everyday of my life, i see the same for everyday, i mean breedas getting stabbed and mothers snorting off their prams ooohh ooohh ooohh

So when the mic turns on its like im trapped in a song, trying to find the right words so the whole world can sing along, and if i lie in a song it aint coz im writing it wrong, im just trying to open the eyes of the youths to show them whats going on, in a place where little girls bring harm to themselves,little boys go to jail and hang themselves in the cells, its all hell, as the times are getting harder sitting back watching all the dramas passing by us like theres no answer, so where do we walk to? and who do we talk to? so come to an understanding when a breeder wont bore you, what happened to a time you wrote a ryhme and people adored you? and now you say one ting the breeder will scortch you, thats why we resort to all the violence and torture 9 minutes to morse, seeing breeders get slaughtered, coz theres no feds and no order, im just trying to survive another night living this life inside a border, 10 years ago it wernt nothing like this then 5 years down the line the mood started to switch, right up to now even walking to the shop is a risk, see the youths are fighting with guns instead of using their fists

Chorus
We're in it from morning to night,someones always going down now, im feeling the shots, the dealers the cops, always seem to be circeling round town, everyday of my life, i see the same for everyday, i mean breedas getting stabbed and mothers snorting off their prams ooohh ooohh ooohh

Damn right londons getting sicker by the day, one of you n****s come out, the others making us wait, and you was only kidding with them, yesterday, i just prey to god guides them through the rest of the way, believe me this shit is despressing, reason being he went to this guy, got caught selling, at first it was all good now hes behind bars stressing, its mind wrecking, missing the main years of his life, well thats sure to be a lesson,and anyone else to be caught for possession, for the colour of their skin or simply by the way they dressing, and feds always seem to judge us on the first impression, thats why i dont really know where the hell this life is heading, 10 years ago it wernt nothing like this then 5 years down the line the mood started to switch, right up to now even burning passed a shot is a risk, and these days the gal your linking can be the biggest snitch

Chorus
We're in it from morning to night,someones always going down now, im feeling the shots, the dealers the cops, always seem to be circeling round town, everyday of my life, i see the same for everyday, i mean breedas getting stabbed and mothers snorting off their prams ooohh ooohh ooohh
