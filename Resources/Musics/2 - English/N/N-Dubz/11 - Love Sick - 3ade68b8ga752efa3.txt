LOVE SICK

Don't make a sound
I might be dreaming boy
So don't wake me now
Let me believe in this
One more minute
One more second now (oh)
One more smile and,
One more touch and we'll go

Lust in your eyes
Yes baby,
Always tangled up in your lies
It's getting harder
And i've seen all the signs
I gotta get up and leave now

(Chorus)
Because i want what i want
And yes my heart is broken
And i'm scared but i know
Another door will open
It's only love
And though my heart isn't fixed
I know
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick) love
sick

There was a time
You'd look at me
And you'd reflect all that I
Trying to be and for
One sick minute
One bad second I thought
We could have it
you were all that I'd want

Tossed in your hands
And yet i easily got lost in your plans
And looking back i should of notcied back then
I should of walked away, yeah
It doesn't matter now

(Chorus)
Because i want what i want
And yes my heart is broken
And i'm scared but i know
Another door will open
It's only love
And though my heart isn't fixed
I know
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick) love
sick

Don't make a sound
I might be dreaming boy
Don't make a sound..

Because i want what i want (yeaaah_
And yes my heart is broken
And i'm scared but i know ( i know)
Another door will open
It's only love (it's only love)
And though my heart isn't fixed
I know (i know)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick love
sick) (im so love sick, yeah)
Im just a bit love sick, love sick (love sick) love
sick.
I'm just a bit love sick.

Im just a bit love sick..
