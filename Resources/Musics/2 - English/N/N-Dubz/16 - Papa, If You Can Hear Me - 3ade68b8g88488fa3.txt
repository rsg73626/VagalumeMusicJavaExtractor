PAPA, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME

D A P's to the Y

Nah Nah Frickin'

And this is for my DAD!
Uncle B

Yeah, I don't mean to bore, you know my name
Chill for a second, just hear my pain
If you've lost any loved ones you'll feel what I'm saying
I Ope it's peaceful, down there were they lay 'em

When someone you loved, who put you up from the start
Built you up and made you into who you are
Who always believed, saying that you'll be a star
Then all of a sudden they just passed

Dash the reaper from ontop of ma wardrobe
Slap den crack, from side of the mouth
Put me on stage infront of a crowd
Now we're picking up awards while he's under the ground

My Daddy this and my Daddy that
Well I found mine dead on a couch in ma flat
So much to say, I wish I coulda said bye
The only time I'll talk to him is when I look into the sky

Faze: YEAH!

CHORUS!:

All I've got is these pictures of ya
And your light blue crack down Nokia
Things in my house still smell of ya
All I wanna say is:

Papa if you can hear me... !
I regret every bad thing that I saaaid
Please forgive me if you hear me...
Never knew how much I loved ya till you was dead... !

Papa if you can hear me...
Dappy: If only youuu, knew what you went and done
Please forgive me if you hear me...
Dappy: See all I know is, I'm proud to be your Son
Papa if you can hear me...

Faze: We're getting away in the world, it's how I'm flowing with N-Dubz
If it wasn't for you B there wouldn't be N-Dubz
Kept us together never knowing we'd end up
Moving onto Mobo's pushing the bench up
You pushed and pushed when no-one wanted to believe
But back then it was all a dream

It's like you sacrificed your life
For the love of success and a life full of stress
I'm vexed cuz

First they love you, second they hate you
They talked about you, when they tried to play you
Behind your back they were tryna betray you
But B, I never had a chance to repay you
For the things you done for me
Put me on the right path, kept me from steering left
Yeah we had a right laugh
But I be feeling like Bruce Willis, each and everyday I really wanna Die Hard

CHORUS!:

All I've got is these pictures of ya
And your light blue crack down Nokia
Things in my house still smell of ya
All I wanna say is:

Papa if you can hear me... !
I regret every bad thing that I saaaid
Please forgive me if you hear me... !
Never knew how much I loved ya till you was dead... !

Tulisa: If only youuu
Dappy: Papa if you can hear me... !
Dappy: If only youuu, knew what you went and done
Tulisa: Please forgive me if you hear me... !
Dappy: Please forgive me if you hear me... !
Dappy: See all I know is, I'm proud to be your Son
Papa if you can hear me... !

Tulisa: I never ever hear what you said
The fights and the laughter
The success and disasters, No!
But nothing seems clearer...
Than the day you were gone...

You said, despite all the stress
You haveta fight to the death
Coz little girl your a star
Don't let em kill who you are...

You see you gave me a chance
And now look where I am
You are the reason, I can't wait to see you again...

CHORUS!:

All I've got is these pictures of ya
And your light blue crack down Nokia
Things in my house still smell of ya
All I wanna say is:

Papa if you can hear me... !
I regret every bad thing that I saaaid
Please forgive me if you hear me... !
Never knew how much I loved ya till you was dead... !

Tulisa: If only youuu
Dappy: Papa if you can hear me... !
Dappy: If only youuu, knew what you went and done
Dappy: Please forgive me if you hear me... !
Tulisa: See all I know is, I'm proud to be your Son
Dappy: See all I know is, I'm proud to be your Son
Papa if you can hear me... !

(All doing backing vocals on the last chorus)

N-Dubz, Tealease, I haveta say I dropped a tear when I done this shhh...
