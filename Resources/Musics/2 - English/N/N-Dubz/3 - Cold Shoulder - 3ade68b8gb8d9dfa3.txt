COLD SHOULDER

Na Na
Naiiiii

(Yeah) why don't you come over 
(Yeah) Warm up your cold shoulder
(Yeah) Yeah we can get crazy baby all night before we got sober

Look at yourself 
Now that aint good for my health
If you carry on burning hot much longer
The floor beneath us gon melt

Follow to me to the bar baby
Otherwise we can take it to my Mercedes
Put the roof down like it's the late 80's
Push on my gear stick and I'll drive you crazy

Take a look at the time
Baby quit playing games cuz the sun's 'bout ro rise
We've been here
All night
Only live once so we might as well act like this

Why don't you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober

Wait for hangovers
Something for ya
I'm gonna keep you up
I'm gonna keep you up

Why don't you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober

Wait for hangovers
Something important
I'm gonna keep you up tonight

I'm all dressed in red and I'm all off my head
But I'm not looking to get ratched by Feds
I'm looking to get between your legs
Let me come into your world, baby
You won't be the only one that's wearing coughs lately
We can make love or we can do it rough, baby
However you let me do it I'ma drive you crazy

Take a look
At the time
Baby quit playin games cuz the sun's bout to rise
We've been here all night
Only live once so we might as well act like this

Why don't you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober

Wait for hangovers
Somethin' important
I'm gonna keep you up
I'm gonna keep you up

Why don't you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober

Wait for hangovers
Somethin' important
I'm gonna keep you up tonight

No more talkin let's go 
What you standin there for
Let's get tipsy, let's get wasted
Then we'll party some more

No more talkin let's go
I just cant wait no more
It's time to hit the floor now
I'm gonna give you up

Why don't you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober

Wait for hangovers
Somethin' important
I'm gonna keep you up
I'm gonna keep you up

Why don't you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober

Wait for hangovers
Somethin' important
I'm gonna keep you up tonight
