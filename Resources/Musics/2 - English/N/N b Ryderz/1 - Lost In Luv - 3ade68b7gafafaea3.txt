LOST IN LUV

[speaking] 
How you doing sweetheart? hey ah you know these last few months we`ve been 
Togetha, have been so right and I`m just so happy for what we share, I`ve been 
Wondering how do you feel? 

[1st Chorus] 
I wanna get lost in love with you (oh yeah?) 
And do all the things you want me to 
Caress your body, touch your soul 
Cuz boy I love you sooo (and I love you too baby) 
[Repeat] 

The love we share is something so especial 
Estar contigo is all I wanna do every night 
Ever since el primer dia, the first day 
I knew we`d last foreva if I had it my way 
So the days go on, no hago otra cosa, but dream 
About the moments our hearts 
Will come closa 
Holding tu mano, and your face tan bonita, never met another young lady 
Señorita 
And that is why I gotta say that you`re the best 
A million and one ways just to express 
Mi amor, I know that we will be togetha, so sing to me baby and sing foreva 

[2nd Chorus] 
I wanna be with you always 
Together forever `till our ending days 
Hold me baby don`t let go 
Making love like never before 
[Repeat] 

Making love in the night time 
Walks and romance 
I`m telling you hermosa 
My heart is in a trance 
They say that true love is so hard to find 
I thank the man up above 
For making you mine 
Talking on the telephone sending you kisses 
A dozen of roses just to say that I am missing 
The warmth of your body right next to mine 
Eres tu la mejor like a toast of fine wine 
Out to the movies maybe sharing some ice cream 
Si estoy dormido, don`t wake me from my dream 
Todo lo que quiero, all I need is your affection 
My life was fine, but you brought perfection 
Now we sit here just holding hands 
Whispers in my ear tell me that I`ll be your man 
Today, mañana, in a paradise for two 
I feel the same way cuz I`m so in love with you 

[3rd Chorus] 
I love the way you make me feel 
My love for you is oh so real 
Embrace my body, touch me soflty 
Love me `till the morning 
[Repeat] 

You know that love we share is just something so special 
The tenderness, I just don`t know what to say girl 
Would you sing to me? 
One more time do it like this, come on 

[Back to 1st Chorus] 
I wanna get lost in love with you 
And do all the things you want me to 
Caress your body, touch you soflty 
Cuz boy I love you sooo 

[Back to 2nd Chorus] 
I wanna be with you always 
Together forever `till our ending days, 
Hold me baby don`t let go 
Making love like neva before
