MOTHER

You gave me life, 
brought me into this world, 
carried me for nine months and I thank you.

Clothed me and fed me, 
you taught me right from wrong 
and I just want to say thank you on this day.

Chorus:
 Mother I love you because you've done so much for me
 Mother I adore you because you've been more than just a mother to me

You were always there when I needed someone to talk to
Never was there a time when I was lonely
Mother, you paved the way so that I could have a future
With every tear that fell from my eyes, mother, you wiped away

Mom, I dedicate this song to you and all those other mothers in this world
You know words could never express just how much you mean to me
Bud, I’d like to take this time to let you know, and the whole world know that you’ve been more than 
A mother to me
You’ve also been my friend
Mom, I love you!
