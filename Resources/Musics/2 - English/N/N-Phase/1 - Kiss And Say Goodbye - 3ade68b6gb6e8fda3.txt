KISS AND SAY GOODBYE

This is got to be the saddest thing of my life 
I called you here today 
For a bit of bad news 
I won't be able to see you anymore 
Because of my obligations  
And the ties that you have 

We've been meeting here everyday 
And since it's our last day together 
I wanna hold you just one more time 

When you turn and walk away 
Don't look back 
I wanna remember you just like this 
Let's just kiss and say goodbye 

I had to meet you here today 
There's just so many things to say 
Please don't stop me 'til I'm through 
This is something I hate to do 

We've been meeting here so long 
I guess what we've done,  
I know it was wrong 
Please darling, don't you cry 
Let's just kiss and say goodbye 

Now many months have passed by
 (I'm gonna miss you)  
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie, oh no  
I've got ties and so do you 
I think this is a thing to do 

It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie 
Maybe you need, you need another guy 
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, ... 
Let's just kiss and say goodbye 

(I'm gonna miss you) 
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie 
(I'm gonna miss you) 
Understand me, won't you try, try, try 
Let's just kiss and say goodbye 
(Just say goodbye)
