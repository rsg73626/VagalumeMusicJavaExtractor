I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME

What will this day be like, I wonder 
What will my future be, I wonder 
It could be so exciting 
To be out to the world, to be free 
My heart should be wildly rejoicing 
Oh, what's the matter with me 
I've always long for adventure 
To do the things I've never dared 
Now here I'm facing adventure 
Then why am I so scared?? 
A captain with seven children 
What so fearsome about that 
Oh, I must stop this doubts, all this worries 
If I don't I just know I'll turn back 
I must dream of the things I am seeking 
I am seeking the courage I lack 
The courage to serve them with reliance 
Face my mistakes without defiance 
Show them I'm worthy 
And while I show them, I'll show me....... 
So let them bring on all their problems 
I'll do better than my best 
I have confidence they'll put me to the test 
But I'll make them see I have confidence in me 
Somehow I will impress them 
I will be firm but kind 
And all those children, heaven bless them 
They will look up to me and mind me 
With each step I'm almost certain 
Everything will turn out find 
I have confidence, the world can all be mine 
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me 
I have confidence in sunshine 
I have confidence in rain 
I have confidence that spring will come again 
Besides which you see I have confidence in me 
Strength doesn't lie in numbers 
Strength doesn't lie in wealth 
Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers 
When you wake up, wake up! 
It's healthy 
All I trust I leave my heart to 
All I trust becomes my own 
I have confidence, in confidence alone 
(Oh help........) 
I have confidence, in confidence alone 
Besides which you see I have confidence in me
