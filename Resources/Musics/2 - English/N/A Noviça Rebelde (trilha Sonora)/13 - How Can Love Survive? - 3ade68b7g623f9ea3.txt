HOW CAN LOVE SURVIVE?

[Elsa]
Oh Max!

[Max]
In all the famous love affairs
The lovers have to struggle.
In garret rooms away upstairs
The lovers starve and snugggle.
They're famous for misfortune which
They seem tohave no fear of,
While lovers who are very rich
You very seldom hear of.

[Elsa]
No little shack does he share with me,
We do not flee from a mortgagee,
Nary a care in the world have we,

[Max]
How can love survive?

[Elsa]
He's fond of bonds and he ows a lot.
I have a plane and a diesel yacht,

[Max]
Plenty of nothing you haven't got!

[Both]
How can love survive?

[Elsa]
No rides for us on the top of a bus
In the face of the freezing breezes

[Max]
You reach your goals in your comfy old Rolls
Or in one of your Mercedes-es!

[Elsa]
Far, very far off the beam are we,
Quaint and bizarre as a team are we,
Two millionaires with a dream are we,
We're keeping romance alive.
Two millionaries with a dream are we,
We'll make our love survive...
How can I shw what I feel for him,
I cannot go out and steal for him,
I cannot die like Camile for him

[Max]
How can love survive?
You millionaires with financial affairs
Are too busy for simple pleasure.
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour,
For l'amour all the poor have leisure!

[Elsa]
Caught in our gold platted chains are we,
Lost in our wealthy domains are we.
Trapped by our capital gains are we,
But we'll keep romance alive.

[Max]
Trapped by your capital goals are you

[Both]
We'll make our love
survive!
