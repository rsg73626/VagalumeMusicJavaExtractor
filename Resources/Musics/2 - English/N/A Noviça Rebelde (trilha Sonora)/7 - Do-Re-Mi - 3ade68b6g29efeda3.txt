DO-RE-MI

Let's start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-B-C
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

Do-re-mi, do-re-mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

[Maria:]
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
[spoken]
Let's see if I can make it easy

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

[Maria and Children:]
[Repeat above verse twice]

[Maria:]
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

[Maria: (spoken)]
Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song.
Once you have these notes in your heads, 
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up.
Like this.

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
[spoken]
Can you do that?
[Children:]
So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
[Maria:]
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
[Children:]
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
[Maria:]
[spoken]
Now, put it all together.

[Maria and Children:]
So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do
[Maria:]
[spoken]
Good!
[Brigitta:]
[spoken]
But it doesn't mean anything.
[Maria:]
[spoken]
So we put in words. One word for every note. Like this.

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
[spoken]
Together!

[Maria and Children:]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do

Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
Do Ti La So Fa Mi Re

[Children:]
Do Mi Mi
Mi So So
Re Fa Fa
La Ti Ti
[Repeat above verse 4x as Maria sings]

[Maria:]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything

[Maria and Children:]
Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to

[Maria:]
[Children:]
