SO LONG, FAREWELL

There's a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the
hall 
And the bells in the steeple too 
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird 
Is poping out to say cuckoo 


Cuckoo, cuckoo 
Regretfully they tell us 
But firmly they compel us 
To say goodbye 
To you... 
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night 


I hate to go and leave this pretty sight 
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu 

 
Adieu, adieu, to you and you and you 
So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen 


I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne 
Yes? 

Capit√£o
No! 
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good bye 

 
I leave and heave a sigh and say good bye 
Goodbye... 


I'm glad to go, I cannot tell a lie 


I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly 


The sun has gone to bed and so must I 
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good bye 
Good bye, good bye, good bye... 

Goodbye...
