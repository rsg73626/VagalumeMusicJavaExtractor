MARIA

She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee 
Her dress has got a tear 
She waltzes on her way to mass 
And whistles on the stair 

And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair 
I even heard her singing in the abbey 
She's always late for chappel but her penitence is real 
She's always late for everything except for every meal 

I hate to have to say it but I very firmly feel 
Maria's not an asset to the abbey 
I like to say a word in her behalf 
Maria makes me laugh 

How do you solve a problem like Maria 
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down 
How do you find a word that means Maria 
A flibbertijibbet, a will o-the wisp, a clown 

Many a thing you know you like to tell her 
Many a thing she ought to understand 
But how do you make her stay 
And listen to all you say 

How do you keep a wave upon the sand 
Oh how do you solve a problem like Maria 
How do you hold our moonbeam in your hand? 
When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bermused 

And I never know exactly where I am 
Unpredictable as wheather 
She's as flighty as a feather 
She's a darling, she's a demon, she's a lamb 

She'd outpester any pest 
Drive a hornet from its nest 
She can throw a whirling dervish out of whirl 
She is gentle, she is wild 

She's a riddle, she's a child 
She's a headache, she's and angel 
She's a girl 
How do you solve a problem like Maria 

How do you hold our moonbeam in your hand? 
How do you find a word that means Maria 
A flibbertijibbet, a will o-the wisp, a clown 
Many a thing you know you like to tell her 

Many a thing she ought to understand 
But how do you make her stay 
And listen to all you say 
How do you keep a wave upon the sand 

Oh how do you solve a problem like Maria 
How do you hold our moonbeam in your hand?
