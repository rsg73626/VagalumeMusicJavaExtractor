SOMETHINGS GOOD

Maria 
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood 
Perhaps I had a miserable youth 
But somewhere in my wicked, miserable past 
There must have been a moment of truth 
For here you are, standing there, loving me 
Whether or not you should 
But somewhere in my youth or childhood 
I must have done something good 
Nothing comes from nothing 
Nothing ever could 
So somewhere in my youth or childhood 
I must have done something good 

Capit達o 
For here you are, standing there, loving me 
Whether or not you should 

Maria 
So somewhere in my youth or childhood 
I must have done something good 

Maria e Capit達o 
Nothing comes from nothing 
Nothing ever could 

Maria 
So somewhere in my youth 

Capit達o 
Or childhood 

Maria 
I must have done something... 

Maria e Capit達o 
Something good
