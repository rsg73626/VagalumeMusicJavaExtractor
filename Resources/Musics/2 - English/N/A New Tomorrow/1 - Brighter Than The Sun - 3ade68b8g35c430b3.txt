BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN

One of those days
Your brain takes away
everything that your soul would like to say

Then the clouds
Move around you head
Now it's time to fly away

Out of the shade
Together we are brighter than the sun
Out the shade
Together we'll get there

One of those days
So easy to mistake
So easy to fade away

Then the sun
Condemned to be chained
Will try to breakthrough
And shine again

Out of the shade
Together we are brighter than the sun
Out of the shade
We'll get to our new heaven
Yee yeah

On and on we're standing tall
And never will look back no more
On and on we're standing tall
We're there, there

Out of the shade
Together we are brighter than the sun
Out of this game
We'll take you to a new heaven
Yeah

Out of the shade
Together we are brighter than the sun
Out of your game
I'll take you to a new heaven
Yeah

On and on we're standing tall
And never will look back no more
On and on we're standing tall
We're there, there

On and on and on and on
AA a aah
On and on we'll never fall
We're there
Theere
