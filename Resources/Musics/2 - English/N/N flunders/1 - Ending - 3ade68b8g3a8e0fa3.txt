ENDING

I wonder if I'm strong enough
To reach your hands for one last touch
And if I have just one more chance

To say goodbye I could forget
I can't erase what has been said
But I do try to ease the pain

Your memory still badly hurts
You raped my heart my soul is cursed
I hope you learned something from what we have faced
And I wish that you could be happier someday
