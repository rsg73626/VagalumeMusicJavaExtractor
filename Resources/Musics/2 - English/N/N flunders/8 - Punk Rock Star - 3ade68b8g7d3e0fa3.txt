PUNK ROCK STAR

I ask myself about a way
To turn these things around
But they all say
I gotta wait for another day

I don't wanna wait
Cause everything is being gay
I play my guitar
But all my dreams are going so far

I guess that it's just me
And all I wanna be
Cause being a punk rock star
You get no fame at all
I'm sure this time
I'll get what I deserve
