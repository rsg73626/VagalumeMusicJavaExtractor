LET ME IN

Let me in
It's so cold outside
Tonight I wanna be inside your heart
And I'll try
To stay away from you
But I need myself to be part of your life

You know that I won't care
You've been for years inside my head
And so I will be there
Even if you don't want me
I won't care, I won't care
You know that I won't care

Yeah I know tomorrow
You will hang me up the phone
So I guess it's better
Not to call call you home
