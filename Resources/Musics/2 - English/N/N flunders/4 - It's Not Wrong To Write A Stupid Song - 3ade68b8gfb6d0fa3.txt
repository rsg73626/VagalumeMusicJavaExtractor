IT'S NOT WRONG TO WRITE A STUPID SONG

Senior year in high school
All the girls are getting cool
I start a band
I call a couple of friends
I'm gonna write so many songs
I wanna be like Tom Delonge
On NBC
Or maybe MTV

And it's not wrong
To write a stupid song for you
If it's not wrong for me
It should be right for you
And I don't care about what they say
I'll kick their ass and go away
I'll be on Top of the Pops
Cause I am singing now my stupid song for you

Jenny told me I'll find my way
All the girls will scream my name
I'm in a great boy band
We're making a new trend
I'm gonna write so many songs
I wanna be like Tom Delonge
On NBC
Or maybe MTV
