FRIENDS

I hate myself for being here
You're not understanding what I feel
Nobody cares but anyway
I wanna know what happened to you
I'm just trying to get through
In this situation I can't change

I don't wanna be anymore
Your boyfriend cause I know
That you wanna be my best friend
I'm gonna stay as long as I can
Just trying to understand
But I don't wanna be just a friend

Now it's time for me to give up,
What I need is not here anymore
I should face the truth and leave you now
But I am still here in our house,
Just wanna hold you for the last time
Tomorrow's just another day
