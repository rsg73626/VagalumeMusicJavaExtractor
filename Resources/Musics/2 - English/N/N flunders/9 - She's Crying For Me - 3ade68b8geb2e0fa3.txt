SHE'S CRYING FOR ME

I believe there's a place
Where we can be together more than a life
I believe there's a place
Where we can live forever without fights
But i am here
I am standing here alone in the dark
I am here
I am looking for your eyes among the stars
Before I go to sleep
There's a thought still stuck inside my mind
Before I go to sleep
I'm used to think about you by my side
But i am here
I am standing here alone in the dark
I am here
I am looking for your eyes among the stars

She's crying for me
She's crying for me
Cause I can't be what I wanna be
I don't understand
She went away from me
But she still tells me that she needs me
