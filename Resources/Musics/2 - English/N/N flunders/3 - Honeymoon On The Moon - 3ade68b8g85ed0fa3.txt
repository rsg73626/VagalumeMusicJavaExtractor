HONEYMOON ON THE MOON

We're going out today
Please i wanna go see N.Flunders play
We have nothing else to do
She just seems ready to go

Oh no, i dont wanna come
Remember last time we took the car
At the crossroads near the fields
There were skaters jumping the streets

Im gonna buy a spaceship for you...
Im gonna buy a spaceship for you...
And I will take you to our honeymoon on the moon
