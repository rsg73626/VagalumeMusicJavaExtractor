BOYZ-N-THE-HOOD (REMIX)

Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back, and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this :

Cruisin' down the street in my 4
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the ho's
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly mothafucka pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gage
One sucker dead, L.A. times front page

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there - makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin'
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho'
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the 64 'round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said "oh brother"
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in his head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Forth afence on the boy, he'll do some time

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit ...

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellows Caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six years sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "FIRE!", then came Suzi

The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit ...
