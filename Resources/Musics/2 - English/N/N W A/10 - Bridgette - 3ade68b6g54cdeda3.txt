BRIDGETTE

There once was this girl i knew named Bridgette
She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midgette
So i had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling
I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King
Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip
And asked the DOC do you mind if i nibble this
No, i took her to the back of the studio
And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio
I told the bitch yo please don't bite me
Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
So i slapped the bitch for goin out like a sucker
My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker
To make her stop i pulled up on her extentions
And i left Jimmy standing at attention
The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner
Now i look back on the day I should have peed on her

-Chorus-
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was  a girl that i screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

So you know bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC
And you know i'm still out to get the pussy
Tried to be nice cuz i didn't wanna diss her
Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler
Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee
Then i could tell that she wanted to fuck me
She said Lets skip dinner and i had a fit
At ten dollars a plate i said fuck that shit
Thats the whole reason our relationship was stormy
Why cuz Bridgette was too fuckin horny
She said please excuse me for a minute
To powder my nose i said ya i'm with it
She took a long time the food came and i'm chewin
Thinkin to myself what the fuck is she doin?
Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin
Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin
Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang
But i flipped cuz it was Bridgette gettin gang-banged

-Chorus-
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was  a girl that i screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

So you know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She says she wants to come over and see me
And do any thing to fuck the DOC
She said she loves me but i didn't say i love her
Went to the store and bought me some rubbers
Then i made a phone call up to the guys
Boy this bitch is in for a big suprise
When she came in i put on a stone record
Said a few lines and the bitch got naked
Later on the bed i told her to suck my dick
And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet
Turned her ass over layed the ho on her back
Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin Amtrak
Dre had the back and Easy had the front
I'm behind Ice Cube cuz thats where the line started
Bitch gettin dogged bye the DOC and NWA
Dogged the bitch out in each in every way
Thats what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette
The dumb ass ho she liked the shit

(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was  a girl that i screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
