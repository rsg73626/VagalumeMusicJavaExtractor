RISE

I can't stand your face up in mine, 
Always wanting to know things I do 
It's funny how things change 
I redefine how much faith I have in you 
You won't get the best of me 
You won't take the best of me 
You will watch it as it all falls down 

Hey you 
Stand the fuck up and rise 
I'm not afraid 
Hey you 
Stand the fuck up and rise 
I'm not afraid 

I can't fake the way I feel inside 
Every one of those eyes judging me 
It?s funny how things change 
I redefine how messed up this life can really be 
You won't take the best of me 
You won't get the best of me 
You will watch it as it all falls down 

Hey you 
Stand the fuck up and rise 
I'm not afraid 
Hey you 
Stand the fuck up and rise 
I?m not afraid 

You can't get the best of me 
You won't get the best of me 
You will watch it as it all falls down 
You won't get the best of me 
You can't get the best of me 
You will watch this all fall 

Hey you 
Stand the fuck up and rise 
I?m not afraid 
Hey you 
Stand the fuck up and rise 
I?m not afraid
