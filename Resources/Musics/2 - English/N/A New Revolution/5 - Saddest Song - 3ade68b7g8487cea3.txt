SADDEST SONG

With these words
On a blade
'cause my heart is bleeding
It's not enough,
not enough for you
I'll sing these word in your ear
'cause my heart is screaming
It's loud enough,
loud enough for you

TAKE something that makes me
SMILE something that its worthwhile
Something that keeps me hanging on

And all you are
Odd to me
The saddest song I will ever sing
And all you are
Odd to me
The saddest song of the saddest thing

Take all the fault
All my wrongs
And i said im sorry
It's not enough,
not enough for you

SAY something that makes me
FEEL that what i thought was
REAL something that keeps me hanging on


And all you are
Odd to me
The saddest song i will ever sing
And all you are
Odd to me
The saddest song of the saddest thing

And all you are
Odd to me
The saddest song of the saddest thing
And all you are
Odd to me
The Saddest song i will ever sing
And all you are
Odd to me
The saddest song of the saddest thing
