LET GO

No use sayin'
What I don't wanna say
No use sayin' at all

There's no use fakin'
The way we used to be
There's no use fakin' at all

And if I let go
Will you let go with me
Cause I can't keep holdin' on
I've given everything
And If I let go
Know that you can't hold on
You can't hold onto me

There's no use playin'
All those stupid games
There's no use blaming
When you're never here to blame
So I stop trying to save what can be saved
And I stopped trying for so long

And if I let go
Will you let go with me
Cause I can't keep holdin' on
I've given everything
And If I let go
Know that you can't hold on
You can't hold onto me

If I let go (repeated)
