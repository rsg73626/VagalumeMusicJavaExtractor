CAVE IN

Condescend every lesson learned
Over again
I imagine that
You are with me
Replay the last scene
Over and over again
I try to make things right
But it's not reality

I'm still waiting (still waiting)
I'm still waiting for you to go
So frustrated (frustrated)
I won't cave in to you anymore

Make up lies
Just to see if
You really care
Lack of reaction
Keeps me wanted
You intentions
Are just false impressions
(smiling in the burn)
I try to make things right but
It's just the last straw

I'm still waiting (still waiting)
I'm still waiting for you to go
So frustrated (frustrated)
I won't cave in to you anymore

I'm not good enough to
Hold my breath
When I see you around
I wish I could take back
Everything
I tell myself
This can't go on
I tell myself
This is the last straw

I'm still waiting (still waiting)
I'm still waiting for you to go
So frustrated (frustrated)
I won't cave in to you anymore
