NME

If I could say one word
Then you would see
Scream one word
And you will be
Crying out for help
But only on the inside

If I could take your hand
And point it to
Open your eyes when I'm pointing at you
And that's the feeling of guilt
Coming from the inside

Every day
It comes and goes
It's gone away
It won't let go now
I can't believe I've finally seen the enemy

Every day
My head hits the wall
Every day
My skin starts to crawl now
I can't believe I've finally seen the enemy in you

Another dark lost cause, a misleading truth
How many times can they sell this to you?
There's no sympathy left, coming from the inside

So if I took blame, then so are you
I'm bringing the pain that you put me through
There's nothing else left, not even on the inside

Every day
It comes and goes
It's gone away
It won't let go now
I can't believe I've finally seen the enemy

Every day
My head hits the wall
Every day
My skin starts to crawl now
I can't believe I've finally seen the enemy in you

Everybody knows
The way things always go
What comes around will go around
It's a lonely, lonely road
There's no place to go
There's no-one here who knows me now

(Whispered)
Every day
My head hits the wall
Every day
My skin starts to crawl

Every day
It comes and goes
Every day
It won't let go now
I can't believe I've finally seen the enemy

Every day
My head hits the wall
Every day
My skin starts to crawl now
I can't believe I've finally seen the enemy in you
