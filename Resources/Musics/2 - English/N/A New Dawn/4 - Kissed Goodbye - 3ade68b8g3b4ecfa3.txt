KISSED GOODBYE

When darkness falls
like a cloak around you
Don't fear the wolves
howling at your door
I have built this
wall around you
Yo protect you
forevermore

When there is light
on the edge of darkness
One more step
and you're sure to fall
There's no hope
for the unbeliever
Who believes
there's no hope at all

I prayed fot the day
They would
understand the way
Dreams were there
to comfort
when they turned,
turned their backs on me
I close my eyes
as I take a final breath
Never will they
compensate fot dreams,
dream I never had

Never will they
compensate,
Never will the
compensate for that
