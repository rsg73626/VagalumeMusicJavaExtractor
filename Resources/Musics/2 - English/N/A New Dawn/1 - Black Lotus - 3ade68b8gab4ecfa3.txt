BLACK LOTUS

In a green field far, far away
Opens a flower
at the dawn of a new day
Its beauty is stunning
its fragrance is sweet
But under the leaves
death lies at its feet

Black lotus

Near a dark pool grows
a small sprout
Across the world
its tiny seeds spread out
To poison the mind,
and the heart and the soul
In order to achieve its dark goal
