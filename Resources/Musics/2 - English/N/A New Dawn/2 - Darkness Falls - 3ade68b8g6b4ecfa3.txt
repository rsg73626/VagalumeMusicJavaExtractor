DARKNESS FALLS

Am I awake, dead,
or on my way
to heaven
The night is closing in,
but not in reality
And as a sinner
that stands before
the Inner Sanctum
I try to stand up all,
but still I'm down
on my knees

An evil soul, sinister
seductive serpent
She has the face
of an angel with
a halo of light
She will deliver the
goods you've ordered
from her merchant
Than she disappears
just like a thief
in the night

Time may be
the perfect healer
But only so if you
know how to let go
Mental wounds
leave mental scaras
But to the eye they
will hardly ever show

When darkness falls,
blessed are
the innocen
The truth is out,
the lies are old,
the truth is yet
to be told
The sands of time
leap from the
hourglass
The final's played,
the curtain calls,
then the darkness falls

Still I'm starling
at the ceiling
Still my eyes
are open wide
Still I dream
of my illusion
Stillborn, swept out
with the tide

Time may be
the perfect healer
If you know
how to let go
Mental wounds
leave mental scars
But to the eye
they seldom show

Still I can remember
As I'm passing
througt the open
door
Twisted truths
and wicked lies
I've lived them
all before

Darkness falls
