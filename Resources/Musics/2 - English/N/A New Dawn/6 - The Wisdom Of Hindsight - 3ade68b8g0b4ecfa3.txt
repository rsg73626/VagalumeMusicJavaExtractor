THE WISDOM OF HINDSIGHT

I heard the voices,
heard the screams
I saw the faces
in magazines
A lady in black,
she turned around
Once you've in
you won't come out

Their minds are
void of innocence
Perverted smiles
and decadence
Forbidden streeds
are paved with gold
This is where
illusions are sold

Do you hear their voices?
Do you hear their screams?
Inside walls od pure gold
there is nothinh
left to dream...

The cradle of deception
Resides inside this place
An angel so defiant
Fallen from grace

The truth had
really hurt her
She left aline in doubt
The walls of gold
surround her
And there is no way out

As time was proceeding
old wounds
started bleeding
Seduction keept waiting,
impationtly breeding
The truth in your life
is obsecured by a lie
That hides in darkness
away from the light

Depending, addicted
you could not resist them
You'll dance like a slave
to the beat of the system
In wakening hours
when peace is forlorn
Dreams are forgotten,
hopes are forgone

Entends-tu les viox?
Les cris autour de toi?
Car entre les murs
d'or aveuglant
Tes rêves brûlent
comme Iéncens

Do you hear voices,
can you hear sceams
Inside of these walls
there wil be nothing
left to dream...
