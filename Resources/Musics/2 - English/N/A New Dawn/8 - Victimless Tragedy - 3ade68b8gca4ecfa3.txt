VICTIMLESS TRAGEDY

All but a memory,
I dearly paid the price
Bridges may be burnt,
but from the ashes
I will rise
Free from all misery,
agony and pain
Soon I will be
coming home again

Waiting in the distandce,
watching from the sky
Hiding in shadows,
a memory gone by
Slowly I emerge
from underneath
frozen ground
I will find the truth
without a doubt

Tears for the lost one
Teart they will cry
Tears from their eyes
Why did I have to die
Rain down from heaven
Please mother
tell my why
Fire and ice

Tears are begotten
Those people I see
Tears will be gone
Will they forget about me
Dreams are forgotten
Will I be erased from their
histroy
Hope is forlorn

So you must wait
On this cold stone I lay me
head to rest
They you will find
I will wait and find
the truth about my past

Sentenced to rejection
as it soon would manifest
Buried in frozen ground,
but never laid to rest
The pennies from my eyes
have fallen to the ground
I will find the truth
without a doubt

Tears for the lost one
Teart they will cry
Tears from their eyes
Why did I have to die
Rain down from heaven
Please mother
tell my why
Fire and ice

Tears are begotten
Those people I see
Tears will be gone
Will they forget about me
Dreams are forgotten
Will I be erased from their
histroy
Hope is forlorn

So you must wait
On this cold stone
I lay me head to rest
They you will find
I will wait and find
the truth about my past

I will wait and find the truth
about my death...
