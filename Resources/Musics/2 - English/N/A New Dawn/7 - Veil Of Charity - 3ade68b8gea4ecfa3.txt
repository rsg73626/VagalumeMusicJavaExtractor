VEIL OF CHARITY

I won't ask you
to understand
If the feeling's right
then take my hand
A promise made,
a solems start
We'd dance the dance
'till death do us part

The music fades
You see the world
through different shades
To understand
The time to deal
is close at hand
So come the day
To end the pain
and walk away
For evermore
The time has become
to heal the score

The dats go by
the music fades
You see the world
through different shades
To realize is to understand
The time to deal
is close at hand
So come the dawn
so come the day
To end the pain
snd walk away
To break these chains
forevermore
The time has become
to heal the score

Now don't you cry,
now don't you weep
The world goes on
while you are aslepe
You sit and watch
the days go by
Accept the truth
or live in the lie

I hear you, I fear you
And all the things
that you do
I hear you
calling my name
Tomorrow and after
The sound of
wicked laughter
Still hear you
calling my name

I hear you, I fear you
And all the things
that you do
I hear you
calling my name
Tomorrow and after
The sound of
wicked laughter
Still hear you
calling my name
