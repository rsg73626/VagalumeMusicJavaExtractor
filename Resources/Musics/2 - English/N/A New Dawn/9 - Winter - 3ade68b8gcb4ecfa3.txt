WINTER

Screams break through
the silence of the night
Eagles are circling
across the moonlight
The dark creatures
gather and behold
A new season
so deadly and cold

Storm, rain,
tunderclouds
and lightning crashes
I see dark silhouettes
between the flashes

I flee throught snow
now covering land
So virgin white now,
soon will turn red

As I run I hear
a wolfd cry
As id saying:
here you shall die

As I run I hear a wolfs cry
as if saying:
here you shall die,
here you shall...

Scouting throught the
darkness, searching
trought the night
The wolves that howl are
heralding Armageddon
They feel that winter had
arrived

Die, die, die!

Fear the night,
you fear the darkness
Fear the night,
you flee, you flee

Fear the night,
you fear the darkness
Fear the night,
when you flee
you flee into the light

Scouting throught the
darkness, searching
trought the night
The wolves that howl are
heralding Armageddon
They feel that winter had
arrived

Land of hope
abandonded glory
In vain I hope
Heaven turned
to purgatory
Alone I cry
Lightning flashes,
fire in the sky

Drowning in
unholy water
With pain so deep
Lambs are waiting
for the slaughter
The end so nigh
Wolves are howling,
winter has arrived

When the final
season arrived
In vain I hope
And descende
on God's creation
For one last grain
Is it ever to ascend
the earth again
Ever to ascennd
the earth again
