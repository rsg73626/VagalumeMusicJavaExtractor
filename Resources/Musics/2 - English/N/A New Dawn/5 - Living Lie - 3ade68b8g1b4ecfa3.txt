LIVING LIE

You've opened my eyes
You have made me realize...
I have had insights
Now I've learned to
swallow my pride

Why do I cry
Why are you leaving me
behind like this
Here I draw the line
No more time for me
to suffer sleepless nights

Find your way,
open your eyes
Now it's time
for you to realize
I'll naje you see,
like you showed me
There's no answer when
there's got to be one
Watch how you play
against me
And no doubt
ever fills your mind
Beware what you
choose to see
You are such a living lie!

Now I've found
your little weak sport,
you've become
what you despise
Bitching, cheating,
not practicing
what you're preaching
you are sush a living lie

Couls I've been
blinded by hate
I seek your advice
Is this my free will
or just an ect of faith
Deo Volente
Give me a sign because
I love in darkness

Find your away,
open your eyes
Now it's time
for you to realize
I'll make you see,
like you showed me
There's no answer
when there's got
to be one
Do you dream,
do you cry
I would want
to take a look inside
Shut your mouth,
open your eyes
I'll make you feel
like nothing is real

Now I have found
your little weaksspot
You've becoome
that you despise
When you've
given up believing
You've become
a living lie!

Could I've been
blinded by hare
I seek your advise
Is this my free will
or just an act of faith
Deo Volente
Give me a sign
because I live
in darkness
In'shallah
Deo Volente

Find your way,
open your eyes
Now it's time
for you to realize
I'll make you see,
like you showed me
There's no answer
when there's got to
be one

Do you dream,
do you cry
I would want
to take a look inside
Shut your mouth,
open our eyes
I'll make you feel
like nothing's real

Watch how you
play against me
And no doubt
ever fills your mind
Beware what you
choose to see
You are such a living lie!
