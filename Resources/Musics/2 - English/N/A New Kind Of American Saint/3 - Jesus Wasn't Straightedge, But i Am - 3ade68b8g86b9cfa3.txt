JESUS WASN'T STRAIGHTEDGE, BUT I AM

It’s hard to put the gun down when you feel it’s someone else’s finger on the trigger. Are you satisfied with your life?
Take a knife and carve into your chest all my fears, and I’ll stand before you with my arms spread apart and my head up tall, and I’ll scream down every lie ever told to you. When the shit hits the fan some kids sell out, while others look up and smile.
