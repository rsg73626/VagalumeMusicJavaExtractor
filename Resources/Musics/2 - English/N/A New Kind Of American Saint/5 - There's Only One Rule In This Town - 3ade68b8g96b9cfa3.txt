Oh, if Nation of Ulysses only knew they had fans like these. And do you remember the first time that you ever saw him, and how he was the best thing you had ever seen? How could you forget that feeling?
How could you ever forget someone like that? You could never forget someone like that. And I can safely say that I know exactly how it feels. How could I ever forget you? I could never forget you. You’re still the best thing that I’ve ever seen.
