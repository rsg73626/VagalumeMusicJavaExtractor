DON'T LET THESE TIGHT PANTS FOOL YOU, I'M ALL HEART MOTHERFUCKER

Hey Ben, don’t let these nights get you down. Did you forget we’re boys with dreams?
Heartbreakers and Rock N Roll makers. So wait out these lonely nights for countless summer days. Imagine shirts off and windows down.
With old friends in new towns. No don’t forget we’re boys with dreams.
