ANGELS

Never worried about nothing
Making clouds in the air
Going too far like taking a Jet
Tripping too much
I don't really care
My eyes are straight cause I look like an asian

If you wanna get high

Come to me baby girl
I show you how to do
Sync with that OG
Like me and you
If you hear this shit
You know that's for you
You've already seen me ball
I call this swag
Step in the club
Let's have a blast
I need a lady for my crew
Someone to buy those Louis V
You are too beautiful
Matches with my Benz
I love that smile that's in your face
Hurry up shortie
Let's take a plane

(Chorus)
If you wanna get high
I can show you how to do
Feel like touching the sky
Like angels do

If you wanna get high
I can show you how to do
Feel like touching the sky
Like angels do


Twist it
Roll it
Let it burn slow
Kush too strong in my hood everybody knows
Paper planes
Spaceships
Can someone bring a bong please?

Feel like touching the sky

Look at me now, bro
My eyes still red
Don't need to worry
I wear Gucci glasses
Even high I don't miss my swag
Feets in the sand
While you sleep
This is the life that you dream to live
Take a pen nigga
And start to note
I explain while I count my notes
I smoke, you smoke
You high, I smoke
You high, I smoke
Just now i'm high
Is not a dream
I'm really born to fly

(Chorus)
If you wanna get high
I can show you how to do
Feel like touching the sky
Like angels do

If you wanna get high
I can show you how to do
Feel like touching the sky
Like angels do


I you wanna get high

Feel like touching the sky

I you wanna get high

Feel like touching the sky
