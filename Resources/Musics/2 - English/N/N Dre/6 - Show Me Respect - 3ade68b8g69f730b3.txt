SHOW ME RESPECT

Niggas be mad when I say the truth, but it's just facts


What you talking nigga?
Say it in my face!
Getting money and fucking bitches
Do it everyday
Everytime smiling, cause I'm the best
All you got to do it's show me Respect

Fools and jerks are afraid of the best
All you gotta do is show me respect
Always fresh, I have hot chicks with me
Being hated, I must be graduated in

Who the fuck are you to talk shit about me
Introduce yourself, your girl describes me
some hates, many gets amazed
success it's my plan and I know that's my fate
You talking shit, I'm puffing
You hating, I'm loving
I just don't get stressed, cause all the time I'm high
You in the sewer while I'm flying


What you talking nigga?
Say it in my face!
Getting money and fucking bitches
Do it everyday
Everytime smiling, cause I'm the best
All you got to do it's show me Respect

two words, fuck you
the world is too big
but not for the fools
people like you doesn't kwon what to do
when you see me doing things you would never do

I turn the lights off, she scratch my back
I turn the lights on, she says I'm the fucking best
I know why you mad
cause I just smoke, fuck and rap
keep watching me, I'm growing too fast
When I pop a champagne your girl looks at me
I bet a million she want to live like this
I do this shit cause I'm a mother fucker king
When we win, we do things like this

What you talking nigga?
Say it in my face!
Getting money and fucking bitches
Do it everyday
Everytime smiling, cause I'm the best
All you got to do it's show me Respect
