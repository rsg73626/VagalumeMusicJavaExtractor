OUR PROBLEMS

Girl all the relations have their problems
Unfortunately, we are not different from the others
We all have bad days and some fights
But what is real doesn't fall apart
I thought these days would never come
Even in the fairy tales they show up
Not because I buy you new clothes and shoes
I don't want be better than you, I just want the best for you

(Chorus)
Girl, I know you love me
We have our problems
I don't care about this
Cause we love each other (repeat)

You call my phone and talk your shit
Ha-ha, I know, You read the script
This is a movie we already know the end
thank god, the world spins
Girl you already know, I don't need to explain
I love you and You love me
Cause I treat you like a queen
Holding my hand
You run the streets
In the end of the night
You scream in the sheet
Look's that I don't care about it
I'll love you till the infinite

(Chorus)
Girl, I know you love me
We have our problems
I don't care about this
Cause we love each other (repeat)

Everything is possible when the love takes over
easier see the light in the end of tunnel
Perfect when the things back to normal
It's like see the sun,
in raining days
Have no secret
We are in love again
Thanks for the moments and the pleasures
That we passed thru
Girl I know you love me, You don't know what I think about you
Babe, I desire you can read minds
Just to see the princess
That I see in you

(Chorus)
Girl, I know you love me
We have our problems
I don't care about this
Cause we love each other (repeat)
