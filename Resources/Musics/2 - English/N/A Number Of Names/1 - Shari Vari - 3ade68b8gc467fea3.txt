SHARI VARI

Some bread and cheese and fine white wine
Designer chic is a matter of time
Could this be the real thing?
Or is this just another fling?
Seen by millions nationally
L'oumo Vogue, Playgirl, G Quarterly
Because he's down on his etiquette
Shari Vari is really it

*chorus*
Shari Vari
Shari Shari Vari

Smoking on his cigarette
Listening to his car cassette
Cruising with his hot playmate
In his Porsche Nine Two Eight
Heading for the highest heights
For the climax of the night
The people there they just won't quit
Because the music's really it
