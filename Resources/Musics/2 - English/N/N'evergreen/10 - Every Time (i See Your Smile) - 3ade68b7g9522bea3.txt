EVERY TIME (I SEE YOUR SMILE)

Would you give me your love
Would you give me your night and day
If I gave you my word
If I told you that I am here to stay
You're all that I need
Girl you are my everything
You're the air that I breathe
You're the rhythm in the songs I sing

It's every time I see your smile
It's the way you look tonight
You got me down on my knees
I'll be waiting 'till you say you do
And every time you say goodbye
I'm about to loose my mind
You got me head over heals
Said I'll never turn away from you

Now whatever you do
Girl you are the only one
You're just too good to be true
But you'll always be my shinin' sun
Whereever you go
No matter which way you choose
I'll be waiting don't you know
I could never take my eyes of you

It's every time I see your smile
It's the way you look tonight
You got me down on my knees
I'll be waiting 'till you say you do
And every time you say goodbye
I'm about to loose my mind
You got me head over heals
Said I'll never turn away from you
