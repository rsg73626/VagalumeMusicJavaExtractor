NEVER LET YOU GO

lonely nights aint hard to find
years gone by girl but you're still the one I want
you're all my life - you're the reason why
I'm still holding on

I'll never let you go
that's how much you mean to me
there's no way you're leaving
nothing can tear us apart
I'll never let you go
I swear I'd be needing you
with every beat of my heart

broken dreams are everywhere
no one cares when you're down on your own
you should know that I'll be there for you
baby I'll be around

just stay here one more night
there's nothing good about goodbye
all I want is to hold you
in my arms for evermore
never leave your side
there's nowhere to hide
there's no end and there's no begining

I'll never let you go
that's how much you mean to me
there's no way you're leaving
nothing can tear us apart
I'll never let you go
I swear I'd be needing you
with every beat of my heart
