I HAVE BEEN SEARCHIN' (GOING HOME)

When the moon is full and burning bright
Comes a strange feeling
Something's watching in the night

I'm tossing and turning
In a cold and sweaty bed
I search for answers
To questions that are ringing in my head

Must I kill again tonight
How can I fight the Beast within
Must I kill again tonight
My soul will burn from the sin
Must I kill again

Forty thousand years have passed
But man has never Learned
Legendary fears are,
Cast in blood that doesn't burn
Only a shot of silver
Can release these chains that bind
A bullet from a holy Cross
Brings the kiss of death so kind

Savage instincts rules me
Grim despair entombs me
Haunting dreams torment and control
The hunger for flesh devours
A curse immortal powers
Inhuman lust to kill tears at my soul

Severe the bloodline
Give me release
The undead are screaming
For vengeance and peace
