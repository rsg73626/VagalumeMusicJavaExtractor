SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE

search and you will find there is no reason
I can't convince myself to let you go
I never promised you it would be easy
it seems to me that nothing's fair in love

since you've been gone
baby you've been on my mind
since you've been gone, how can I go on
since you've been out of my life
baby since you've been gone
I guess that I should be alright
since you've been gone, how can I go on
since you've been out of my life

I'm not so sure this is the right decision
I still believe that we can find a way
girl why can't you see how much I miss you
I'd wish you would come back to me and stay

since you've been gone
baby you've been on my mind
since you've been gone, how can I go on
since you've been out of my life
baby since you've been gone
I guess that I should be alright
since you've been gone, how can I go on
since you've been out of my life

since you've been gone
I can do what I want
I can go anywhere
because now nobody cares
since you've been gone
I can hear all the songs on "kill 'em all"
but I feel so alone
all I want is to turn you around back home

since you've been gone
baby you've been on my mind
since you've been gone, how can I go on
since you've been out of my life
baby since you've been gone
I guess that I should be alright
since you've been gone, how can I go on
since you've been out of my life
