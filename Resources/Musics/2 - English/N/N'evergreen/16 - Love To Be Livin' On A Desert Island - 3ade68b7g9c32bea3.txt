LOVE TO BE LIVIN' ON A DESERT ISLAND

I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna get you baby

All this time you've been lookin' for love
askin' why love aint lookin' for you
well your eyes have been closed for so long
I guess you've got to make a move

one more night one more name on your list
if true love is blind you may have an excuse
there where times you'd have setteled for less
now does it matter who you choose

Love to be livin' on a desert island
wouldn't it be the perfect place to hide
Love to be livin' on a desert island
how would you like your private paradise

There's not a face or a smile you remember
you could swear that you've seen her before
and though it feels like you've been here forever
you keep on coming back for more

she doesn't know 'bout your first date behaviour
says she wont let this chance pass her by
well you may as well pick her up
do you want to wait for the love of your life
until the day that you die

how I'd love to be livin' on a desert island
wouldn't it be the perfect place to hide
Love to be livin' on a desert island
how would you like your private paradise

I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna get you baby

Love to be livin' on a desert island
wouldn't it be the perfect place to hide
Love to be livin' on a desert island
how would you like your private paradise
