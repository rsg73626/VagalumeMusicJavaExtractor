IN A MOMENT LIKE THIS

For as long as I remember, for as long as I’ve been blue
Everyday since we’ve been parted all I’ve thought about was you
Didn’t need the time for sorrow, didn’t need the time for pain
What am I supposed to do when living without you was the worst I ever knew?
In a moment like this
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you’re looking for
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know if you’ll ask for more
Oh, in a moment like this
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you
Oh, in a moment like this
Ever since the day you left me, ever since you went away
I’m lost and I don’t know where am I supposed to go, I still miss you so
In a moment like this
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you’re looking for
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know if you’ll ask for more
Oh, in a moment like this
When I need for you hold me, say you’ll love and never leave me
My heart will forever be true
In a moment like this
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you’re looking for
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know if you’ll ask for more
Oh, in a moment like this
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you
Oh, in a moment like this
