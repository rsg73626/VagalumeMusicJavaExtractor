I NEVER WILL BELIEVE IN LOVE

I never will believe in love
I never will believe in love

For your sin, for my revenge
Blood and heal the first
For your dreams, for silence grace
Wanna feed your tears

You are the betrayal
I'll be your sins
You are the razor blade
I'll be your pain

I never will believe in love
Love for pain unfaithful an angel
I never will believe in love
Love for hate unfaithful an angel
I never will believe in love
Love for sin inside the temple
I never will believe in love
Love is fine unharmed the temple

You will be to destine
I'll be your sin
You will be the perdition
I'll be your skin

I never will believe in love
Love for pain unfaithful an angel
I never will believe in love
Love for hate unfaithful an angel
I never will believe in love
Love for sin inside the temple
I never will believe in love
Love is fine unharmed the temple

I never will believe in love
I never will believe in love
