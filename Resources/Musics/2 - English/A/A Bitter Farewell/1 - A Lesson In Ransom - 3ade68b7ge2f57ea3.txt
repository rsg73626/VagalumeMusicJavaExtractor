A LESSON IN RANSOM

Tonight we paint the town red
With all of our green, while plotting domination
Drink the vintage years, mingle with the kings
Thus confirming exploitation

Take them by the hand
Walk them all the way
All the way to the bank
But we will keep one king in our hands

Shots FIRED!!

CHORUS:
A ransom has been demanded
Now its just a waiting game
But the cops are right outside our door
And their weapons are ready

Dressed to the nines we will kill
The innocent at heart
And they were guilty 
because they know to much

Take them by the hand
Walk them all the way
All the way to the bank
But we will keep one king in our hands

CHORUS:
A ransom has been demanded
Now its just a waiting game
But the cops are right outside our door
And their weapons are ready

And we looked at them and we said
We see your eyes and they show us fear
We see your eyes and they show us fear

With your weapons drawn against us
You know that they are useless
Throw em down hit the ground
Or no hostages will go unharmed

CHORUS:
A ransom has been demanded
Now its just a waiting game
But the cops are right outside our door
And their weapons are ready
