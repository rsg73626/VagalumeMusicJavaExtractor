ROMANTIKILL

Her plan was perfect
The way she left this world
Sweet little girl
She showed us all
What she was made of
Forced understanding
Of a self-inflicted, induced tragedy of the familiar kind
Last time it was nothing
This time it was everything
Next time ill be the one thats up in your face
Cause i feel nothing
Next time ill be the one thats up in your face
Cause i feel everyting, go
One second from loving
Two seconds from hating you
Somehow im stuck in this time, this time
Somehow ive never felt so alive
Somehow im stuck in this time, this time
Somehow ive never felt so alive
Sweet little girl
She showed us all
You tried to tell us
Signs that you were saying goodbye
Were you incoherent
Or were our ears foolish
Next time ill be the one that up in your face
Cause i feel nothing
Next time ill be the one that up in your face
Cause i feel everything
Chorus
You tried to but why dont you understand me
Next time ill be the one thats up in your face
Cause i feel nothing
Next time ill be the one thats up in your face
Cause i feel everything
That you left behind
Bring....every...thing...you...left behind
