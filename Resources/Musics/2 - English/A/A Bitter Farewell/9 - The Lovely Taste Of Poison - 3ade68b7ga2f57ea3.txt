THE LOVELY TASTE OF POISON

In your presence I am dying with a smile
If only I could forget and turn my back on the past
My wish never happened
I could save this part of me, which it kills, a little everyday
I hope

But I have seen this with my own two eyes on to many times

This must be, the lovely taste of your poison

I reached out and felt hands full of nothing
I poured my heart out
And now the colors bleed

The change is now, and I will do anything to make it right again
I hope to fall asleep and see that things have changed
Ill look away this time

This must be, the lovely taste of your poison

I reached out and felt hands full of nothing
I poured my heart out
And now the colors bleed

And now the colors bleed.
Now the colors bleed
