I NEVER KNEW

Everyone is waiting,
for you to come back,
come home.
Everyone is waiting for my
bad habit to start.
And no matter
how hard we try,
things come and go and
eventually pass by.

But not me,
I’m not here
To judge…
You

Never mind the distractions of this life,
Show me nothing and everything
I never knew, I never knew
These complications will bring us
to our knees.
What makes us stronger?
The fighting will bring
Us into, us into

So many distractions,
so many excuses
for us to come undone.
A uniform of silence,
a brick through a broken window,
as people stare
while they pass by.

Never mind the distractions of this life,
Show me nothing and everything
I never knew, I never knew
These complications will bring us
to our knees.
What makes us stronger?
The fighting will bring
Us into, us into

Don’t take back what you gave,
my heart will stay the same.
If this was meant to be,
we’ll come around…

Never mind the distractions of this life,
Show me nothing and everything
I never knew, I never knew
These complications will bring us
to our knees.
What makes us stronger?
The fighting will bring
Us into, us into
