GOODBYE FOR NOW

And when the smoke clears nothings left
Black ashes still fall from the sky
I see a figure standing far away 
And a shadow on the ground, but I don't know why

I've lost all hope in you
I want out of this place called home tonight
So goodbye for now
I'm never coming back no, not tonight

And life is dark with your eyes always closed
you'll never see a thing
I never wanted any of this, no not at all
But it will be okay

I've lost all hope in you
I want out of this place called home tonight
So goodbye for now
I'm never coming back no, not tonight

Bittersweet every touch, Still burning in my memory
Can't turn back the hand of time, 
Can't make believe that your still mine
'Cause your so far away

Goodbye for now...

I've lost all hope in you
I want out of this place called home tonight
So goodbye for now
I'm never coming back no, not tonight

All eyes off me, no more pathetic memories
All eyes off me, no more pathetic memories
All eyes off me, no more pathetic memories...
