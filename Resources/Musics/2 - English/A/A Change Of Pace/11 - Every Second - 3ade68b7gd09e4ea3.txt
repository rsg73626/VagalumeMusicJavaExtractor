EVERY SECOND

The last drop of the bottle fell out 
Reluctant not to crash 
Enter fading lights 
From top of the stage 
Set in broken glass 

And all these tears and pain 
Silent but screaming 
Out every name that we've ever loved 

And all remember every second 
Every moment 
This cant last forever 

The last drop of the bottle fell out 
And we were way too late 
To save a friend in need 
From his family 
That didnt treat him right 

And all these tears and pain 
Silent but screaming 
Out every name that that we've ever loved 

And I remember every second 
Every moment 
This cant last forever 

Every second 
Of every moment 
Nothing lasts forever 

Dont worry 
About me 
I'll be fine this time 

Dont worry 
About me 
I'll be fine this time 
This time 

And I remember every second 
Every moment 
This cant last forever 

Every second 
Of every moment 
Nothing lasts forever 

Let us breathe softly 
And keep this quiet 
No one has to know 
No one has to know 

Let us breathe softly 
And keep this quiet 
No one has to know 
No one has to know 

Know ... know ... know ...
