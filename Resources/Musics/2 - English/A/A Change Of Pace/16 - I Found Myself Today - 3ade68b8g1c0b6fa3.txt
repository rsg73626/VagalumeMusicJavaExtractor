I FOUND MYSELF TODAY

I will admit
I tend to be a little selfish
But only when it comes to
Something that I couldn't miss
The hardest part is trying
To know what I really want
(Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh)
So I'll apologize ahead
For dragging you along
(Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh)

(Chorus)
Hey, theres just no better way
When there's nothing left to
Say, That you take back
All the mistakes
I guess I finally
Found myself today

I know the feeling to be
Caught up in the motion
I often wonder if it's
Instinct or addiction
I'm slowly learning how to fake
I even have a clue
(Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh)
Because I'm supposed to be
The very best at what I do
(Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh)

(Chorus)
Hey, theres just no better way
When theres nothing left to
Say, That you take back
All the mistakes
I guess I finally
Found myself today

I always feel
Like the cloud around me
Is so frail beneath my feet
And I must fall through
But I think I'm might meant to
If thats what it would take
For me to see

(Chorus) x2
Hey, theres just no better way
When theres nothing left to
Say, That you take back
All the mistakes
I guess I finally
Found myself today

I think I finally
Found myself today
