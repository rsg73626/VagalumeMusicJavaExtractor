A FAREWELL TO A FRIENDSHIP

In a dream
In a place
Where the far reaches of this mind
I have seen a true nightmare
With the kiss of lovers lips
What a friendly offer
Just a memory
It still hurts
When i think that once
She was mine

Because i’m lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There’s nothing left
For me to take from you

I guess its only right
To give someone what they need
Even if its nothing they ever
Wanted in the first place
I’ve seen with my own two eyes
The hurt and pain
That love causes
That’s why i wont let you
Go down that road
Too emotional overdose

If i had her again
Everything would be alright
But nothings alright
And nothings ok
When you live in a memory

I’m lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There’s nothing left
For me to take from you

Just a breakdown of the heart
I’m lost for words that wont mean a thing
A tragic ending
A farewell to
A friendship that meant
Nothing at all
You let her in
You let her win
Is there anything else
To break or mend a bond as strong as ours
That wallow all through love
All through life

I’m lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There’s nothing left
For me to take from you
