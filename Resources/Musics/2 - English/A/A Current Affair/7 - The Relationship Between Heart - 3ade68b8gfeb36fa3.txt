THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEART

Make this hurt
Your words were spoken loud tonight 
Just to hear the faintest whisper in my ear 
And Thatâ€™s all I needed to get my Heart and head on track 
To Sort Through all these things I needed to rid of 
To get where I belong.
This ming will never be aptive again 
You'll take my stoney useless heart of sin 
(I SWEAR THIS THAT I WILL TAKE YOUR STONEY USELESS HEART OF SIN)
I Can't wait 
I Won't wait
Oh God you Know  what I've done 
I've got no place to hide and nowhere to run
Wandering lost and alone 
You're running from the truth that you so clearly know but won't commit your life to 
standing three feet from the door 
Key in hand geld tight 
Your teet glued to this floor 
So take a step of faith 
I won't be there next time to watch you fall face onto the floor again 
I'll play is back for you tonight 
I wont' be giving up the fight
This life is so messe up
This our song that we sing to you all 
I'll reflect on everything you did
That leaves me right back where I'd stand
I'd say that my son has fanally broken his sinful ways 
I've been blessed and now  I'm a new man
Jesus this is where I belong
