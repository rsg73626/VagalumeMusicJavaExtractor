UNDER THE RAINBOW BLEEDS RED

You're running through the darkness
Where you go now?
Put your faith in me, and just
Dying in your dreams
No one's there to listen
To your cries, your lies, your dreams
Where's your God now?
Where's your God now?

You die you don't even show
If you're dead I'd be the last to know
And you die you don't even know
When you dead you'll be on a televised show

How you cry yourself to sleep at night
Tears hanging from your face
You can hear your breathing
Do you try to justify the bruises on your face?

And you die you don't even show
If you're dead I'd be the last to know
And you die you don't even know
When you dead you'll be on a televised show

Where's your God?

This is love, or is it God your love?
And as you cry yourself to sleep
Wishing every night
As you cry yourself to sleep, for the last time
For the hundredth time
This is love, or is it God your love?
These nights these pray to God
Down on your knees and pray to your God

Then you will pray for me with your life
You'll analyze it, til you predue
A God can not see you in your room
