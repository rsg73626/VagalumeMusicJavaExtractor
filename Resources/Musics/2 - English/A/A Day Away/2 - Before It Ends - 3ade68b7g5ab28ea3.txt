BEFORE IT ENDS

We're taking everything one step at a time, holding on to you and i. and now we're holding hands and walking in the sand and hoping that this will not end tonight.

Take a picture, stories told, hold my hand and don't let go. tell me that i'm every thing you need. and this is the last thing i'll say...before it ends.
Living day by day, throwing cares away, and hoping that tomorrow won't come. looking in your eyes never felt so nice. i wanted to freeze the hands of time.

Hold my hand and cut the ties, remember this for all our lives. with you...
