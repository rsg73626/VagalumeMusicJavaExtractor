FEEL THE RUSH

Street lights start to flash red again
When these bloodshot eyes are a constant reminder
Of the trouble she's in

One more hit and I'll be fine
Have one more drink, do one more line
I need these things to keep you off of my mind

Can you feel the rush now
Darling I shall
Take the pills to ease all your pain
I've been waiting for tonight so long
Feel the rush now
Darling I shall
Take the pills to ease all your pain
I've been waiting for tonight so long
So long

Doctor, doctor, tell me I'm a relapse
You said I'd relapse, just need to kick back
I need a way to get this out of my head

One more hit and I'll be fine
Have one more drink, do one more line
I need these things to keep you off of my mind

Can you feel the rush now
Darling I shall
Take the pills to ease all your pain
I've been waiting for tonight so long
Feel the rush now
Darling I shall
Take the pills to ease all your pain
I've been waiting for tonight so long
So long
So long

Nothing ever changes
We make it the best that we can tonight

Can you feel the rush now
Darling I shall
Take the pills to ease all your pain
I've been waiting for tonight so long
Feel the rush now
Darling I shall
Take the pills to ease all your pain
I've been waiting for tonight so long
Nothing ever changes, we faked it
We made it the best we could tonight
Goodbye
