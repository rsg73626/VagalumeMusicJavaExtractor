DEVIL'S VOICE

Wandering around the silent night
Streets are lit by the strange moon light
Aiming with my fiery eyes

You're my banquet
You're my banquet

I will show you a secret sign
You're fragrant with forbidden wine
Make up your mind, you're a sacrifice
Get closer to me baby

I can't stop going under
I can't get myself over
I'm on the verge of climbing 13th stair
... why am I?

Sweet devil's voice is screaming, screaming
Seduce into the world of bleeding
Sadistic violence, kill me, kill me
I'm destined to be judged
So set me free

No one tells me who I am
There are no words of wisdom
Everything is moved by innocent mind
Get close to me baby

I can't stop going under
I can't get myself over
I'm in the catch 22, nothing but despair

Sweet devil's voice is screaming, screaming
It takes me to the place of ending
Hello misery
Kiss me, kiss mee
I feel into the dark
So set me free

Sweet devil's voice is screaming, screaming
Seduce into the world of bleeding
Sadistic violence, kill me, kill me
I'm destined to be judged
So set me free

Freak!
