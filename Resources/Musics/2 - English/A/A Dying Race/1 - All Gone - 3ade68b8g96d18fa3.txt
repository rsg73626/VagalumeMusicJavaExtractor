ALL GONE

I look back on my life
And I wonder why I didn't try
I look back on myself
And it's impossible to justify
Getting old
I let it all slip away
I've gotta change
Running out of todays

Is it all gone?
Is it all gone?
I admit I've wasted all this time
Is it all gone?
Is it all gone?
I've got nothing to show

People always told me there would
Always be another day
Now I'm sitting here and
Everything's still the same
Retrospect's driving me insane
And I must confess
I should have gone another way
