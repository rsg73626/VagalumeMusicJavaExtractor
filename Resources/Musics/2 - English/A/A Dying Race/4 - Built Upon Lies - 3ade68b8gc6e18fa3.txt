BUILT UPON LIES

Another ambulance drives away
Loss of innocence wrong time wrong place
Another leader declares an unjust war
Two thousand more with an undeserving fate
And so I, ask why
Why sufferings a normality of life
And I, just want
To know where the fuck
Where the fuck is our god?

So please explain
If gods so great
Why’s there so much pain?

It’s just another contradiction of your
Unfounded religions
How can there be a god
Because your god would never let this world
Let this world carry on

So go ahead call me sac religious man
If there’s a god then show me some evidence
Well all I hear is oh the good book says
Maybe to you to me it makes no sense

It’s built upon lies

Another chaste girl gets up from rape
Where’s god to wipe the indelible
Tears off her face
Another bomb falls far from the sky
Where’s god to answer the voices
Wondering why
So lets all
Think about
Who’s really answering all our prayers now
And we all
Should find
A new way to pray cause gods a waste of time
