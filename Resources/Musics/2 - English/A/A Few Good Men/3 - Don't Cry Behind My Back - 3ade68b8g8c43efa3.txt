DON'T CRY BEHIND MY BACK

Don't cry, don't cry
Baby don't, behind my back
Don't cry, don't cry

Lady I,
I want to tell you
That you're all that I want
And all that I need
And if you feel you wanna cry
Just let me look inside
I understand the pain
That you feel
And when you need someone to hold you
You can come and run to me
And I will be your guiding in the night

Please don't act like that
Don't cry behind my back
Said I never like the power in your eye
Light the fire inside your heart
If you put your hand in mine
Just let me read your mind
Baby baby please don't act like that
Don't cry behind my back

Baby you
You're the one for me
And when you need me by your side
I will be there
Cause I know what's in your mind
Sometimes you want to cry
But you feel afraid to reveal it to me
But if you bring your broken heart
I will mend every part
So I can be the one to heal it totally

Please don't act like that
Don't cry behind my back
Said I never like the power in your eye
Light the fire inside your heart
If you put your hand in mine
Just let me read your mind
Baby baby please don't act like that
Don't cry behind my back

So when you're feeling down and out
I feel it in my heart
And when you need someone to hold you tight
You know that you can depend on me
And I know
Lovins nothing less you give and get something
At times when you feel you can't go on

Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry behind my back
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry behind my back

I said lovins nothing less you give and get something

Please don't act like that
Don't cry behind my back
Said I never like the power in your eye
Light the fire inside your heart
If you put your hand in mine
Just let me read your mind
Baby baby please don't act like that
Don't cry behind my back
