WALK YOU THRU

With a little romance
Can I get with you
What you don't understand
Baby I'll walk you through it
One two one two
You won't get confused
If you don't understand
Girl I'll walk you through it

I won't hesitate baby
In getting next to you
I'd rather not wait
If there's anything I can do
Make you feel better baby
Let's talk about me and you
Don't be afraid
Of the things I wanna do

I said this time and time again
The things you say just turn me on
I just cant wait to get it on
With you
I said this time and time again
What does it take to be alone
I can't believe it's so strong
And all I wanna give is my love

With a little romance
Can I get with you
What you don't understand
Baby I'll walk you through it
One two one two
You won't get confused
If you don't understand
Girl I'll walk you through it

Come over tonight baby
Let's make it a reality
I guarantee
To keep you where you wanna be
Just let me show you honey
Ain't nothing to fantasy
I've waited so long to get you here with me

I said this time and time again
The things you say just turn me on
I just cant wait to get it on
With you
I said this time and time again
What does it take to be alone
I can't believe it's so strong
And all I wanna give is my love

With a little romance
Can I get with you
What you don't understand
Baby I'll walk you through it
One two one two
You won't get confused
If you don't understand
Girl I'll walk you through it

You've got me all into you
Everything that I say is for sure
No need to feel insecure
I'll take it step by step
One two one two
Let me do what I say

With a little romance
Can I get with you
What you don't understand
Baby I'll walk you through it
One two one two
