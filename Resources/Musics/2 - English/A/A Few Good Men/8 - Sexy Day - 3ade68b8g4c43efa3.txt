SEXY DAY

Sit right here girl
Relax a while
I want to get to know you better
Have I got a day for you
We'll do what lovers do
We can't waste one second of the day

We're gonna go outside
Cuz it's a lazy kind of melody
Take you for a ride
And before you know it we'll be far gone

Come and share this sexy day
Chillin inside my world
I wish it could feel this way
Every day
Chillin inside my world

This time of year
People settle down
It's the season to fall in love
We give relationships
More concern
Cuz we take the time to care for one another

Baby I don't mind
However you wanna spend this sexy day
Whatever you decide
Is cool with me as long as you're here

Come and share this sexy day
Chillin inside my world
I wish it could feel this way
Every day
Chillin inside my world

Let's just take our time
You best believe I could chill with you all day
Get into your mind
Baby there aint no rushing
I wish that we could always feel this way

Come and share this sexy day
Chillin inside my world
I wish it could feel this way
Every day
Chillin inside my world
