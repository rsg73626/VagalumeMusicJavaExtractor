DAYS IN THE SUN - ADAM MITCHELL, STANLEY TUCCI...

[Young Beast]
Days in the sun
When my life has barely began
Not until my whole life is done
Will I ever leave you

[Maestro Cadenza]
Will I tremble again
To my dear one's gorgeous refrain?

[Lumi√®re & Plumette]
Will you now forever remain
Out of reach of my arms?

[Mrs. Potts]
All those days in the sun
What I'd give to relive just one
Undo what's done
And bring back the light

[Madame De Garderobe]
Oh, I could sing
Of the pain these dark days bring
The spell we're under
Still, it's the wonder
Of us I sing of tonight

[Belle]
How in the midst of all this sorrow
Can so much hope and love endure
I was innocent and certain
Now I'm wiser but unsure

[Belle & Garderobe]
I can't go back into my childhood
(Days in the past)
One that my father made secure
(All those precious days)
I can feel a change in me (Couldn't last)
I'm stronger now, but still not free
(Oh, hold me closer!)

[All Except Belle And The Beast]
Days in the sun will return
We must believe as lovers do
That days in the sun
Will come shining through
