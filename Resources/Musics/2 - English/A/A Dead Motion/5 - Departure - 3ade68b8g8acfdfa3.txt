DEPARTURE

Open your eyes and start again, look in your hands under the sand, this pain is over, this pain is over now

This is your time now close your eyes don’t start again, never again, under the weight of the world everything falls apart

We reached the rope and now it’s time, to forget the past and break away
Under the weight of the world everything falls apart

Another way a better day

This is the moment where everything went wrong
Suffocation
The air don’t seem to fit anymore

Everyday rain pours over mistakes
The ones we dug into our veins in pain now
Because we won’t stop, no we won’t stop

The air don't seem to fit anymore
This still stench over claims my thoughts

Consumed by cowardice they poisoned us
Learning from a book of blank pages
Their heart turns numb, a story is born
Division to the horizon, we fell to our own poison

Now you're better to survive
To become stronger than it all
Now you're better to survive
We won't let you down

The air don't seem to fit anymore
This still stench over claims my thoughts

There's no place to flee
