MY BEST FRIEND IS A DEER ON A GREEN BOTTLE

The crows are coming down
Another life turns out as skies reach the ground burning clouds merged into one

And it goes on and on
No more light from the sun, the crows are coming down

Don't wake me this time, leave me in my nightmares
Don't shake me, leave me in my darkness
Far from the sun, leave me far from the sun

Your world is mine forever

You're just a flaw
Your words became nothing but silence
You're just a flaw
Your words became nothing but silence for me

Your words silence
They won't be heard

Fuck you

Give me back what I used to call my heart
Won't sleep til you're fucking dead
Don't sleep til you're fucking dead
