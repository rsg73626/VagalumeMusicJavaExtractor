AGAINST GRAVITY

Here we go
This is another war that you’ve lost

By the time rain falls on you we’ve sail to your promises away, the promises we take
Now it’s time for you to say we failed to your promises away

Promises

This is the end that’s coming back, it’s here again
To show you that you can’t take it another time
You can’t take it another time, we’ll see you choke

The clouds are rising up
Without you on our side
This is now, a new day for us

The clouds are rising up
Without you on our side
We are now, stronger than ever

This is for you
