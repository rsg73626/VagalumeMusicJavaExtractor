THE COMPLETE EMPTINESS

No hope, no cure
No destination anymore
So empty yet complete
I've seen it all before

A gleam of light revealed
But always out of reach
I was never to know
It wasn't part of the show
You need the truth, but truth hurts
What i need is not what is offered
Answers i don't want to hear
I'm sorry i can't help you i suffer too

[*] no nope, no cure
No destination anymore
So empty yet complete
I've seen it all before
The truth it kills
Without any blood spilled
Relieved from life
An urge to fulfill

Life is worthless, life is pain
Here i have nothing to gain
My blood runs down tne drain
(blood rain)

In spite op my dreams, i hold back
For now long will i hold back?
Don't know what life is for
But i don't wanna see anymore

[*repeat]
