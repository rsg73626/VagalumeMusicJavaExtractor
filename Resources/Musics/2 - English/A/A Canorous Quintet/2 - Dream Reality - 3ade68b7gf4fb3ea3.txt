DREAM REALITY

I AWAKE, GONE IS MY DREAM
ONLY IT'S MIST FADES AWAY

BACK IS FEAR AND SADNESS
CLAIMING MY HEART LIKE A BLACK HAND
I CRY AS I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS DAY
I WANT BACK THE DREAM, UNREALITY
IN IT'S GRASP I AM FREE
ONLU IN IT'S DOMAIN CAN I LIVE

NOW ON THIS DAY I AM POWERLESS, POINTLESS
I CAN NOT CONTINUE THROUGH THIS MISERY
HERE NO SPIRITS WILL GUIDE ME
AND I WISH FOR ETERNAL LIFE IN FANTASY

I AM SURROUNDE BY A WORLD OF IGNORANCEAND HATE
YET IT'S MY REALITY

I CAN NOT EXCEPTIT, SO BE IT
I SHALL END MY LIFE
AWAY FRON REALITY
ETERNITY UNFOLDS

[rep. all verses]

(AWAY FROM REALITY, ETERNITY UN)FOLDS
