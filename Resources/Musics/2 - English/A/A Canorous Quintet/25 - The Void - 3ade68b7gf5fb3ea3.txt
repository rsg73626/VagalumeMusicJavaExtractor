THE VOID

Horrified by the magic of night
I'm enchanted under the spell
In pain i scream once again
The pain i thought that i would feel
It came upon me early this time

[*] i try to escape into the void
Into my nomansland
How else would i survive [x2]
Trapped in the spidersweb
She who will eat out my heart
Leaves he with laughters of malice

As many nights before
I fear it's my dying breath
Still i do this with pleasure
Although i know it's pointless and useless
I end up witn tne poison
Running through my veins

(doomed to) eternally suffer
Eternally die
Eternally arise
Immortal in my suffering [x2]

I try to escape into the void
Into my nomansland
Now else would i survive

[*repeat]

The void [x2]
