MY OWN

My own...Craving deep within no chance
For dreams to come true
Molded into a cast from
Life's fondest memories

I thrive on my aspirations of tomorrow
Limitations limited, no chance to become my own

Silent in the words I speak
My own personality I preach right

Total silence cannot speak
My own entity is what I want to be!
