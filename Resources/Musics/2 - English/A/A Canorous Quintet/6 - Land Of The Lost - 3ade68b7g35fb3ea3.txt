LAND OF THE LOST

Riding the winds
Across tne raging seas
To reach the kings in the land of the lost
A turbulent sea winds of cold

Reaching the harbour, they are safe
Entering the gates, castle of splendor
History of 3,000 years has passed
Walls endless as he no longer sees the sky

Mighty forces takes his hand
As the wolf becomes a part of his destiny

Join us in our search for the land of the lost
Join us in our search for the land of the lost

[*] Once again crossing the raging seas
To enter the forest of misery

Trees are closing in as the moonhawk
Cross the skies
The trail is filled with withering bones
Since battles of old
As they are to spill the blood of the poor
No longer unknown, followed by darkness henchmen

[*repeat x2]

Endless speech, time is running out of hand
Dark forces stands in their way
Trying to bring disorder to his thoughts
Swords of lightning end their will
Once again victory has been won
The meeting is done

Mother earth breaks evil bonds
As his mind is freed
When he leaves the elders
With their support
