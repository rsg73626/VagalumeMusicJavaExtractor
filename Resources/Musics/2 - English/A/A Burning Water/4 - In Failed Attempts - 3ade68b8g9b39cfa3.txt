IN FAILED ATTEMPTS

Failed attempts in understanding
only brought me here
consequently i just wanted you today
clearly it was the apprehension that stained the ceiling
draw back the curtains so I can see
clinching fists and crystal dreams they fall here

see through eyes just to wonder why
i just want to follow
falling faster just to find out
counting times you've still to mention

give away your heart
it fades with these daydreams(x2)

i know what this meant
your downfall still sets the stereo

see through my eyes just to wonder
why i just want to follow
falling faster just to find out
counting times you've still to mention

give away your heart
it fades with these daydreams(x2)

your truth is all I know
of course its just for me
I say it has to end
so listen well i will begin
you say I am over loved
I say there's nothing left to hide
the path is mine
I will decide

give away your heart
it fades with these daydreams(x2)
