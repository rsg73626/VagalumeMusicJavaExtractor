WE'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE

Today were breaking up tonight were making love our hands our shaking now
Today your nothing lost tonight your all Ive got Ive missed you more
But you stay away because you hear im bad
But you stay away because you hear im sad

Ive got something I just need to tell you

Today I walk alone tonight Ill walk you home our hands are tied
Today Im one lost soul tonight are souls are whole makes perfect sense
But I stay away because I hear your bad
But I stay away because I hear your sad

Lets make this work
