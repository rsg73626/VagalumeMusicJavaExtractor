DANCE WITH THE STARS

Your exterior is hard and fast while your interior will never last
The poisonous venom that flows in your veins spikes the addiction that I know you crave
The noxious gases that you inhale destroy your brain cells and they make you pale
So take this advice and clean up your act start paying your dues
Learn to love and respect the thing you have

Ill admit that im afraid of dying but a life worth living is a life thats worth fighting for
So ill take my chances and ill let you know
That im not that easy im the one in control
Now how does that sit with you does it hit close to home
Does it make you shake and lose control

Now take your time getting over 
The fact that your dead and youll never be sober
So do another line pretend you can fly 
Leave through the window I cant watch you die
So tell me again what goes through your head
Nothing at all is what she said
Now shes kind of clueless to the things that shes done
The places shes been
Her infamous run with the devils men

Now I know that you havent had the best life
But you also havent had the worst life
And to sit here and watch you die slowly but surely
It tears me apart it tears us all apart
Now theres nothing you can do and I realize that
But there is something that you can do

May the wind be at your back and the sun upon your face
And may the winds of destiny carry you aloft 
To dance with the stars
