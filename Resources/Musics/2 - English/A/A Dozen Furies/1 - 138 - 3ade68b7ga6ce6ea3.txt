138

Be able to envision on your own time,
Your in my world except when your soul is exposed,
The feeling with consistency is what you're built to be,
No miracle no wonder left,
Save your way,
You arose to abolish over,
There's still shine in these eyes,
Let them lead the way,

You're bound to wake up lost inside your nightmare,
Yeah but there's no way to unprotect a lie,
You falsify,
Your word turns empty,
And all the purity dies,

Save your way,
You arose, to abolish over,
There's still shine in these eyes,
Let them lead the way,
Let them lead the way,
Let them lead the way,

Suppose you walk so far away,
No one to find you,
Nothing to save you,
Won't ever change,
Won't ever find you,
Won't ever change,
Nothing to save you,
What a waste,

Wake up in a sea of passion,
And suffocating,
Suffocate my life,
Wake up your passion,
Suffocate my life,
Pain.
