WIND ME UP

Raise your eyes to the brightest
And say good-bye to the last one
And his lost words
Then burn me at the stake
To get on the inside
You succomb to the unknown
In the core you will find me
Behind the controls, screaming...

Rip the stars down
Ya, that's my mood
If I'm going down
I swear I'm taking everyone of you
The bitter end won't be so cold
Wind me up and let me go

I navigate this brainstorm
Subplots begin to unfold
My character dies there
He has to sacrifice a soul
To get on the inside
You succomb to the unknown
In the core you will find me
Losing all control, screaming...

Look in here
When I open up to you
