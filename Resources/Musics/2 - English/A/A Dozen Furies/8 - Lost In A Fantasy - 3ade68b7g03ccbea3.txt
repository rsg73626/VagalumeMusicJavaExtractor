LOST IN A FANTASY

Suspendid
I'm weightless
Probing through my thoughts
I'm unconscious
I swallow the thought of one day
I will wake to reality

How can I find my own?
Lost in a fantasy
When will this life be whole
I've tried a million ways
To break free

I stay high
Sedated
Insecurities far away now
Wasted, I stand here and bleed
For a way to reinvent me

Prepare for the leap
There will be no more suffering
Push within to find the will
To plunge to the end

Take a deep breath
Plunge to the face of the earth
For the awakening
Face down on the concrete
Pick up all the shattered
Pieces of me
