THE HOUSE OF THE DROWNING SUN

The drowning sun
red light shines
foresee the storm
all lights go out

the time stands still
a blowing fire on earth
unsympathetic my view
I am doomed to die
increase my belief in life and
I suffer in truth
burning bodies melt together in red flesh
erasing life

black infected wounds
the dirty blood clots
unsympathetic my view
I am doomed to die
increase my belief in life
I suffer in truth

no longer life in a contaminated air

the time stands still
a blowing fire on earth
no longer life in a contaminated air
