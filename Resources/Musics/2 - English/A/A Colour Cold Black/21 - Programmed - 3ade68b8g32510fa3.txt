PROGRAMMED

noone can see my programmed brain
noone knows that I kill but I don't feel
follow my aim till it is erased
target destroyed-mission is completed
I am programmed to kill
no chance for my victim to escape
terminating life aim after aim
view straight ahead-show no mercy show no tears
emptiness in my eyes-pull the trigger down
target destroyed-mission is completed
I am programmed
programmed to kill-target destroyed-mission is completed
I lighten the hills
the red and the blue
I hunger for skills
and am programmed for you
