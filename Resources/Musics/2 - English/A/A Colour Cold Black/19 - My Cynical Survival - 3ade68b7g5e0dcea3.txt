MY CYNICAL SURVIVAL

He fear, the lies-the cruelty
The glory, the tales-the jealousy
Insanities-the morphine
Things to adore-crumble to dust
Within the hype-you call your name
And then i feel-the nihil
The fear, the lies-the cruelty
The glory, the tales-the jealousy
Insanities-the morphine

I feel like one of a million
I feel like i'm all alone
The moral of the story turns to misinterpretation
Dismember the values into what you feel

So never, so cynical
The only truth is nothing
I don't believe you dreaming
And i'll wipe it all away
Dismember the values into what you feel

Blue, pale, blind
I sure don't mind to spoil it
Waste what you find
I'll be your downer
The corroder
I leave nothing behind
I refuse to swallow the hollow
