HARD TO GET

I can't understand how this was only intuition
Because I've been searching for you like it was a competition
It's simpler when words come out so easily
I'm tending to forget

Know that I'm not bothered by the lack of recognition
You don't want to get me started on my use of contradiction
It's difficult when every person place 
And thing is keeping me from her

Hard to get you get me
Every time I can't complain
I suppose this is something that I'm getting used too

I overheard you mentioning you went to california
Said that being in another place was better off for you
It's simpler when your out of sight and out of mind
I'm hoping to forget

I won't hesitate to compensate for previous events
Cause so many times I feel like none of this is making sense
It's typical of you

Hard to get you get me
Every time I can't complain
I suppose this is something that I'm getting used too

Hard to get you get me
Every time you walk away
I suppose this is something that's worth getting used too

Hard to get you get me
Every time I can't complain
I suppose this is something that I'm getting used too

Hard to get you get me
Every time you walk away
I suppose this is something that's worth getting used too
