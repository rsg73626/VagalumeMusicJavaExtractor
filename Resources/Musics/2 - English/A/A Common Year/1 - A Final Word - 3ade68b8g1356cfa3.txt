A FINAL WORD

I was told I'd have the last word
Don't take that away from me
I'm holding on tight to my charm
Don't take that away from me
And I was told that was the final straw
I said "That's not the first time
I've had those words thrown my way"
So walk away from me and
Spend some time in your room
Replaying every move
Until you learn the hard way
What seems perfect never stays

Believe me when I say
This is working out the way it should
The only way it could
Hear me when I say
That even if you tried
It'd do no good
So go on and escape just like you should

And I was told I was your first love
I know it's not the last time
You'll throw those words someone's way
Don't let me hold you down
Spend some time in your room
Replaying every move
Until you learn the hard way
What seems perfect never stays

Believe me when I say
This is working out the way it should
The only way it could
Hear me when I say
That even if you tried
It'd do no good
So go on and escape just like you should
