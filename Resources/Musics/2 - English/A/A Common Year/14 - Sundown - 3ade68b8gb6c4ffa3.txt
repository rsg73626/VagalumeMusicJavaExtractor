SUNDOWN

You said, "come meet me where the sun goes down"
You said, "come meet me at the edge of town"
And now you look just like a teenage queen
Just slow down cause we're exactly where we need to be

On a night like this, I don't want to move
We could stay right here
I just want to be with you, with you
When we get so close, I can feel your skin
When I'm next to you, this night will never end
Will never end

So we pull over at the county line
The stars are shining like your eyes
And now I'm feeling like a teenage king
The time stops when you're next to me

On a night like this, I don't want to move
We could stay right here
I just want to be with you, with you
When we get so close, I can feel your skin
When I'm next to you, this night will never end
Will never end
Will never end

Will never end
And I would drive for hours just to meet you halfway
Just to meet you halfway
Just to spend a couple of minutes and return to where we came
Return to where we came

On a night like this, I don't want to move
We could stay right here
I just want to be with you, with you
When we get so close, I can feel your skin
When I'm next to you, this night will never end
Will never end.
