ENDING A CHAPTER

I'm starting a new year with the same resolutions
And I found a new love with all the same problems
So I walk through your front door
Just like the night before
To talk about my dreams and if they have meaning

I wish I could say what I need to say
But I'm still hanging on for one last chance to play
I wish that I knew what I need to know
Then it would be easier for me just to let it go

I started a new day with the same reservations
Ending a chapter for all the wrong reasons
So talked to an old friend to try to find answers
To all of the questions that I couldn't ask her
Like why is it so hard?
And why do we care so much?
And why do we hold to what we don't have a hold on?

I wish I could say what I need to say
But I'm still hanging on for one last chance to play
I wish that I knew what I need to know
Then it would be easier for me just to let it go

I wish I could say what I need to say
But I'm still hanging on for one last chance to play
I wish that I knew what I need to know
Then it would be easier for me just to let it go
Starting a new year.
