ANCHORED DOWN

This is my heart. this is my home
And I will fight with every breath that I own
To make sure you know that will never change
And I may be living all my dreams
But you still mean the world to me
So no matter how far it seems, just don't forget about me

Cause I've been waking up alone for so long
And all that I know is
When it rains it pours. when it rains it pours
It's raining even harder now
I can't sleep, can't forget how your voice sounds
And the way that you looked at me
You made me somebody

And if I have to miss you, I swear I'll make you proud
I won't let this go to my head
You're never gonna be just another
Face in the crowd
Cause I know where ever I go you'll be there in spirit
Your name still rings in every note that I sing
And I hope you can hear it

Cause I've been waking up alone for so long
And all that I know is
When it rains it pours. when it rains it pours
It's raining even harder now. I can't sleep
Can't forget how your voice sounds
And the way that you looked at me
You made me somebody

How long will half of my heart be enough?
We're oceans apart, and this might be too much to ask
But I meant it when I told you
You gave me something to come home to
So I'll hold these notes as long
As these words still hold their weight
Hope will be an anchor holding us into place

And I've been waking up alone for so long
And all that I know is
This is my heart. this is my home
And when it rains it pours
It's raining even harder now
I can't sleep, can't forget how your voice sounds
(don't tell me that the distance
Will never make a difference.)
And the way that you looked at me
You made me somebody
(cause it makes the heart grow fonder
It makes the heart grow fonder.)
It makes the heart grow fonder
It makes the heart grow fonder
