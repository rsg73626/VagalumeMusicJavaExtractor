THIS TOWN

What's this game that you're playing
When you stand out of reach
Do your sums before you run
The brightest stones make the brightest beach
This towns got nothing for me
Cheap shots and bad jewellery
Just want to be
Where everyone's free
Lemonade on the sidewalk gives us time to talk
In a great big place
Season to season with the moon and its reason
