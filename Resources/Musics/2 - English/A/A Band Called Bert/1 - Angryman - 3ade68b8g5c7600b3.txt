ANGRYMAN

Built my walls long and low
Knuckles crack and lillies grow
Have a baby hold her up
Let her know
Leave the airport to the airplanes
Leave the taxi to the runways
Silvers high up on the landing
Tastes like early morning

May you never lose your temper
Heavy father heavy sun
May you never lose your temper
Heavy father heavy sun
May you never lose your temper
Heavy father heavy sun
May you never lose your temper
Heavy father heavy sun

Angryman

That's the hurt that's in your head
That's the man that you just met
May not be a brighter day
But there'll be one on the way
That's the hurt that's in your head
That's the man that you just met
May not be a brighter day
But there'll be one on the way
