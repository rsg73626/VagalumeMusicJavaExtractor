CIRCA '98

She kept me inside
Long enough to hear her teeth click shut,
You're charming in a washed out sort of way
A cheap prescription, hair extensions sort of way
Looking great never felt so good
So close to the edge, so close to the end
(The end the end the edge)
Take a breath and bow

Out of breath, I can still see the surface
Out of breath, near my fingertips
Out of breath, someone's left me dry
Out of breath, she kept me,
Kept me inside.
