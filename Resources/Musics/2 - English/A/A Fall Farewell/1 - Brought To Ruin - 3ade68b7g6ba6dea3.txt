BROUGHT TO RUIN

when the dawn finally breaks
and the two make one
light warms the soul
and blinds the eye
flames of passion seem to dance without regard
leaving scars and burning irreparable holes
long after torches fade
reminders of lies remain
unwilling to accept this
visions of reconstruction
all erased by painful tears
as the quilt of youth now tears
and is swept away by deathly winds
the chill sets in
on naive that fostered hopes surreal
hands once embraced begin to slip
this farewell is forever
