HERMIT CRAB

This is torture at it's finest state my blankets are warm and there's too much on my plate I feel happy I feel dull the fireplace is glowing my wineglass is always full fix your hair I think I will sleep under the stars tonight take a walk take a trip take a stand with me the air's much better when you can breathe the sky's more blue when you can see I feel happy I feel content lying on a rock sleeping in a tent one thing I regret is not 
bringing me TV set not to watch or admire but to throw in my dying fire I think this spot will do this is omnipresence in its priest form I've got everything I need right here I thought I had it all::
