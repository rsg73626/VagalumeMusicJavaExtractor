PLEASE DON'T REVEAL THE ENDING

I stepped out of my house for the first time in my life 
I'm feelin' pretty good 
got on my best suit and tie 
I'm riding in a car I've never been in before 
it's black and followed by a few more 
we start to slow down to make a quick stop 
someone opens the back and takes out a box 
standing around a hole with flowers and a tree 
I look at the headstone to see it's me 
I'm gonna be late to the show time to go for the life of me 
I can't express how much I want for you to see, but my tongue holds back 
I just want you to know the ending is worth the wait
I know the plot is slow but this secret must be kept 
I start to walk away then a man calls out for me 
over here, my friend, now it's time to leave 
he pat's me on the back
 said the movie will be great 
a stroke of genius that will make you realize that all that you lived for is right, 
but one thing he said 
there's one simple rule 
slowly the destination comes into view 
the lights are blinding 
I shield my eyes 
the closer I get the warmer I feel 
the kind of warmth that makes your soul heal 
I pull out my wallet to pay 
at the door the man behind the window tells me it's all paid for 
he hands me the ticket and we head inside 
the free ticket seemed strange so I asked my guide why 
he told me I'd lived a good life 
my questions will all be aswered soon so 
here's some popcorn 
your movie is in that room 
please, do not reveal the ending
