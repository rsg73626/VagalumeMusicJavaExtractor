HOLD YOUR LYING TONGUE

Take a long look around think who can I talk about sin overcomes and the lies come pouring out this wretched river of ignorance birds all in the way the more water you create the more trouble you make the sky is falling down the hole is now much deeper you try to dig it out but the rain comes pouring down try to think before you act think before you talk don't do it for me but do it for God don’t you know you hurt him its like stabbing him in the back just try not to lie 
that’s a start I cry out to God with this one prayer please God make the world better all the lies and gossip they must stop hold your lying tongue
