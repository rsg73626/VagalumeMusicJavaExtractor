THE DISEASE OF COOL

Why should we care about what other people think all it does is make our hearts sink I know as Christians we are set apart I know you want to be cool but listen to your heart God doesn't care what other people think of Him He stands with open arms even if 
you don't believe in Him He's always there so don't be afraid just open up your heart and let Him in Jesus came down to free us from sin how can someone sleep without Him tucking you in life is life yeah you know it another cool hat won't help it all you need is a spot for God to sit just be cool that's all that matters why are you trying to please everyone else don't do that if you can't even please yourself I don't want to be a trend setter I want to live like Jesus did
