STOP CALLING US SKA

Stop calling us ska.
don?t stuff us in your box
And set it on fire.
It?s taken me three years to realize

Its such a hateful genre.
If I sing about love I don?t fit in
If I sing about God I am not wanted
Whatever happened to unity?

Yeah, that?s what the sweet  checks 
On your vans symbolize.
It makes me sick, it feels  like torture
every time I hear someone say

?ska ska ska!?

You never listened
You never cared
You sing a happy song because  you?re scared.
Oh no, I said God and it?s not a joke.
I guess I?m shoving this right down your throat
