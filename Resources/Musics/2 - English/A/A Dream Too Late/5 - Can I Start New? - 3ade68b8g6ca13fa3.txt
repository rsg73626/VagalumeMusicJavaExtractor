CAN I START NEW?

I feel your eyes stare into mine
Burning through just who I am
I wish I could make things right again

I know this road takes me from you
But I can't seem to slow this down
I see myself, but you're all around

I cannot run from you
You've caught my every move
I just want you to know
I'm burning down this wall
Can I start new?

It feels like now I'm drowning out
Into the rain and all the noise
Even the streets can hear your voice

I'm running out, can't catch my breath
My lungs are thin and caving in
I want this
I need you now

I cannot run from you
You've caught my every move
I just want you to know
I'm burning down this wall
Can I start new?

I'm running to you now
