DAYLIGHT

Think I broke myself
I just fell a couple feet
Like a glass of ice
The crystals fight

I am here, am I losing ground?
I am one, you are all around
Everywhere

Sometimes I feel like
Love is not after all

The only thing I know is time keeps running
And colors start to glow
Because daylights coming

If I move from here, I wont go back the same
In this puzzle of a life's not really mine
I am here, am I lost or found?
I am one, you all around
Everywhere

Sometimes I feel like
Love is not after all

The only thing I know is time keeps running
And colors start to glow
Because daylights coming

The only thing I know is I'll keep running
And colors start to glow
Because daylights coming

The only thing i know is daylights coming
I stop to watch the sky begin to glow
Because daylights coming
