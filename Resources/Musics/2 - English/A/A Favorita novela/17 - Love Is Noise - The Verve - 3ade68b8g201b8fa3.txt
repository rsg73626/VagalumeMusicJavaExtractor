LOVE IS NOISE - THE VERVE

Will those feet in modern times
Walk on soles that are made in China?
Feel the bright prosaic malls
Through the corridors that go on and on and on

I was blind - didn't see
What was here in me
I was lost - insecure
Felt like the road was way too long, yeah
Cause love is noise and love is pain
Love is these blues that we're feeling again
Love is noise and love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again

Will those feet in modern times
Understand this righteous anger
Recognise this world's addiction
Understand this world's affliction?

I was blind - didn't see
What was here in me
I was lost - insecure
I felt like the road was way too long, yeah
Cause love is noise and love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Love is noise and love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again, again, again, again

Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Come on, come on, ah come on, ah come on
Now come on, now come on, now come on
Now come on

Will those feet in modern times
Walk on soles made in China?
Will those feet in modern times
See the bright prosaic malls?
Will those feet in modern times
Forgive me all my sins
Love is noise
Come on
