BLAME - TIAGO IORC

I got your message on the fone
It seems I'm feeling all alone
And I'm the one to blame, well
At least that's according to what you say
But I think you're wrong
We we're never meant to belong

When you've got nothing to hold on
You blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me

It felt like turning into stone
Made sure my feelings didn't show
How could I be accused when
Deep inside you always knew
That you could be wrong
That I'd be long gone

When you've got nothing to hold on
you blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me
