BOTTLE IT UP - SARA BAREILLES

There'll be girls across the nation that will eat this up babe
I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
Get down to the heart of it, no it's my heart you're shit out of your luck 
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love.
Love love love love.

I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts with her delicate soul 
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start to make room for the parts
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of love love love love
Love Love love love

Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing worth trying to be and it's 

Love
Love 
Love
Love
I do it for Love
Love 
Love 
Love 


We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us oh, 
But sensible sells so could you kindly shut up and get started
At keeping your part of the bargain aw please little darlin'
You're killing me sweetly with love, love love love
Love love love love

Only thing I ever could need only one good thing worth trying to be 

Love
Love 
Love
Love
I do it for Love
Love 
Love 
Love 

Started as a flicker meant to be a flame 
Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall 
Baby's getting next to nowhere with a back against the wall.
You meant to make me happy make me sad.
Want to make it better better so bad.
But save your resolutions for your never new year
There is only one solution I can see here.

Love you're all I ever could need only one good thing worth trying to be and it's 
Love
Love 
Love 
Love
I do it for love, love, love, love
Oh, only gonna get get what you give away, so give love, love
Only gonna get get what you give away
Love.
