KID'S ALRIGHT

Down in the cellar with Dolly and Sue
Smoking fags and feeling cool
Talking to the guy who lives downstairs
Walking around in ridiculous flares
Back in the bushes, we find a cat
Beat'm up with a baseball bat
And grandma says, we'll turn out bad
An go straight to hell, just like dad
But don't you get your hopes up high
The kid's allright
Down in the cellar with Dolly and Sue
Falling in love and feeling blue
Flirting with the guy who lives downstairs
And walking around in ridiculous flares
Playing hooky, pretend we're sick
Mamma don't care if it's just a trick
Cause she just wishes she never had
Those kids from hell who drive her mad
But don't you get your hopes up high
The kid's alright
Now don't you think the kid's alright
