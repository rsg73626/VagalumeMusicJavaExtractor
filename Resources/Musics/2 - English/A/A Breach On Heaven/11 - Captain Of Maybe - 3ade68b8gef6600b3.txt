CAPTAIN OF MAYBE

You put the pleasure in my hand,
Sending out those signs that I just don't understand.
All wasted, with your belly in the sand, moving so slow.
This is not a rehearsal,
This is what we've been waiting for.
Can you hear the sirens call?
They're too loud to ignore.
And you decide, you've seen enough,
This awful scene is way too rough.
Holding out for so long, but you've got it all wrong.
This is not an easy tune, it's gonna grow so slow,
But it means so much more to me than you'll ever know.
'Cause you are the Captain of Maybe,
You put the pleasure right into my hands.
If you are the Captain of Maybe,
Then capture me if you can.
I'm drawing a cirkel on this invisible map of our lifes,
Placing thumb-tacks on all the dreams that we've ever had.
And I agree, we've seen too much.
It sometimes seems like we're way out of touch
With the things that we cannot control,
Well, you gotta let it all go.
This is not an easy tune, it's gonna take some time,
But it means so much more to me
Than what we've ever left behind.
