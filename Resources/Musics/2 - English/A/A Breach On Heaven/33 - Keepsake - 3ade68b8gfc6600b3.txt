KEEPSAKE

Wrapped up in blue, painted by me and you.
A sudden thought exchanged by the two,
Somehow keeps smiling thru.
It's all we got and still,
It sometimes seems so near
And then I reach out and it just disappears.
Was it something that I said
I feel so many moods
There written all across your head
Would I dare to intrude
You sometimes feel so near
But then I reach out and it just disappears
Like the smell of falling rain
Or mown grass in the park.
The kind of things you can not explain,
But feel them in your heart.
It sometimes seems so clear,
Then I reach out and it just disappears.
Paint this day, let's keep this one forever
And wrap it up inside your heart.
Paint this day, for worse if not for better
And wrap it up inside your heart.
'cause that's why I
Sometimes stay awake,
Pondering endlessly on
Each of our mistakes.
Just for keep sake
