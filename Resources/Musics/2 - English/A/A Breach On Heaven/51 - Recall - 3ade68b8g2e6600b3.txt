RECALL

Tunes, thumping like a symphony.
Playing in my mind, I play it all the time.
Please, you don't know what this means to me.
It's something in a dream, or somewhere in between.
And as I lay me down to sleep,
I pary the Lord my soul to keep recalling.
I will recall him.
Seven wonders, seven signs,
Slip into the skies at night, I will,
I will recall him.
And on and off, like a neon sign,
It goes on and off, a faucet in my mind,
Recall, recall, recalling.
Distant life on the bottom side.
I've got a chiselled lie, hiding down my mind,
I fall, I fall, I'm falling.
I fall ? I fall ? I'm fall ? I'm falling.
Distant life on the good old site.
You take another look, the teaser's on my mind.
Recall, recall, recalling.
Soon, heading for the pharmacy.
I don't know what is wrong with me,
Somewhere down the line.
True, looking at the funny side,
I guess I'm never satisfied, with anything I do.
But as I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep recalling.
I will recall him.
But on and off, like a neon sign,
It goes on and off, a faucet in my mind,
Recall, recall, recalling.
Distant life on the bottom side,
I've got a chiselled lie, hiding down my mind,
I fall, I fall, I'm falling.
I fall ? I fall ? I'm fall ? I'm falling.
Distant life on the good old side.
You take another look, the teaser's down my mind,
Recall, recall, recalling.
