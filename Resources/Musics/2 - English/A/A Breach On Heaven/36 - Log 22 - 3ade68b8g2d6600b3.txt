Who needs the show off?

Who needs the Cool Pretence?
On & of, you feel it, too.
On & off, you feel the same way, too.
Tell me, are you disappointed, too?

I'll be there to catch you.
On & of, you feel it, too.
On & off, you feel the same way, too.
Tell me, are you disappointed ?

On & off, you feel it,too.
On & off, I feel the same way,too.
