MISERY GALORE

Have I felt this way before,
All my life was misery galore.
I got used to living on my own,
Got my feelings safely tucked away at home.
Now my feet have finally touched the ground.
Now my eyes have finally looked around.
You say, where have you been all the time.
I say somewhere drifting, drifting in my mind.
