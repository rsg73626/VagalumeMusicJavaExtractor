COLD SNAP

I'm dying of
This weary grief
My wishes are over
There's no compassion
For my crushed lungs

This grudge I hold
Is eating up my heart
And I feel my chest
Tore by slivers

Your words sound great
Like some glass in my mouth
I'd rather have a bath
Under hundreds of knives

Consider this a silly gift
To throw away
As all the things you've never said to me
Consider this a charming lie
Just realize
We've never ever been as one

I'll be back with
With many words to say
About how try
To forgive you

Day after day
I've got something to pay
I still take dreams
For reality, my reality

Consider this a silly gift
To throw away
As all the things you've never said to me
Consider this a charming lie
Just realize
We've never ever been as one

Even if I were six feet under
Or in the deepest of the oceans
I'll surely find a way to get
Out of this neverending time

When everything began to blur
And blistering your skin
When everything becomes a shame
It will be late to cry out your eyes

Consider this
A silly gift to throw away
Like all the things you've never said before
Consider this
A charming lie told for tonight
We've never ever been as one
