BIG TROUBLE

Hey dude what the hell have you done with these crazy tips I gave to you?
I think we're good to go and change these rules
To go and change these rules

And you said "Dare!"
On your hard day
You got this chance
Before they'll put you against the wall

So I swore them
That I'll be there get ready man
To fight with all the strength you've got
Because they're coming in a while
To take her queen back

Let me laugh, nothing's free man
An ashen floor is where I'd like to walk
Left behind and run for cover
A barren shore I hope will mark my core

Hey man it's just begun another day
And you're still singing that freaky song to me
Many words have no sense and expose some weak points
Some weak points

Don't let those people take the throne
Because you are meant to guard

Let me laugh, nothing's free man
An ashen floor is where I'd like to walk
Left behind and run for cover
A barren shore I hope will mark my core

And you said "Dare!"
On your hard day
You got this chance
Before they'll put you against the wall
So I swore them
That I'll be there
Get ready man
To fight against them

Something inside my head
Was just something inside my head

Mama tell me what was going wrong with me
I think the world got a little defect
Mama tell me am I blind?
Or is it them trying to cover it up
