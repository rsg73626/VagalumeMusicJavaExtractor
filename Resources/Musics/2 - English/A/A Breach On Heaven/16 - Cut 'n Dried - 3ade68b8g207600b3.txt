CUT 'N DRIED

It's funny, how we seem to forget
All the hassle and trouble, everysince we met
And then you call me and say that it's
Cut and dried
Anybody for enough just: heartache it's and
To run to where no got you when: distance
Forgiven systematicaly: on hold
It believe one any can: long how
But you're telling me, this is not what you planned.
Forcing me, but I won't take a stand.
I don't wanna leave, but you know
That you always can
And you know that I'd understand
That it's not our good deeds.
We just follow our senses
And we take what we need
And then you call me and say that it's
Cut and dried
Anybody for enough just: heartache it's but
To run to where no got you when: distance
Forgiven systematicaly: on hold
It believe one any can: long how
And you're telling me, this is not what you planned.
Forcing me, but I won't take a stand.
I don't wanna leave, but you know
That you always can
And you know that I'll understand.
