MUSHER

I'd rather have nothing, pale, white and sweet.
Modest, but something crawled up, asleep.
And ever so slightly, down town, give us a call,
Right down truth or nothing at all.
So give me the silence and right when it falls,
There is something I don't recall.
I'd rather have nothing, simple and small.
Honest, but something that learned how to crawl.
And ever so slightly, light brown, cough up a wall,
Right down truth or nothing at all.
I live with this silence from winter 'till fall.
There is something I don't recall.
A thousand of miles out in the cold.
If this ain't the way then I wasn't told.
So give me the silence and right when it falls,
There is something I don't recall.
