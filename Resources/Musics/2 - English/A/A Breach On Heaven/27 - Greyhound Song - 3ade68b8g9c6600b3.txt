GREYHOUND SONG

Well, I iost my little brother when I was still wearing braces
But if I could, I'd find another.
You're eyes, they aren't blue, but they're as misty as a sea fog
But for a brother, I'd still choose you.
We're waiting for a greyhound and we don't know where it's bound
And I left my suitcase behind, but I know you'll find it in time.
And I don't need any luxeries, all I got is what you see,
But I smile everytime I see you.
And I don't need any company, I got a cross-eyed chicken for family,
But I smile everytime I see you.
