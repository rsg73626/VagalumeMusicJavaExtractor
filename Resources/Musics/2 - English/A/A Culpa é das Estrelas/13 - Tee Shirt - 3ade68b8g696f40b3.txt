TEE SHIRT

In the morning when you wake up
I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe you've been dreaming of me
Dreaming

I know 'cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in

I should know 'cause I'd spend
All the whole day
Listening to the message I'm keeping
And never deleting

When I saw you, everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes
But no one else heard the weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind
Falling

I know 'cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in

I should know 'cause I'd spend
All the whole day
Listening to the message I'm keeping
And never deleting
