OBLIVION

I believe, when I see somenthing
You can grow cause I see it in your eyes
Dip it off, still told me
Cause it's all written in the stars

I can see, even from a distance
It makes sense, want you to be mine
This far end, come, come closer
Let it go, lay it for the end

Close to you, I want forever
But it won't last for you to do .. for what it was
Start it out, there's nothing new
Soon to be the beauty of our stars
Start it out, there's nothing new
Soon to be the beauty of our stars

I'm in love with you
Sent it to the wall
I know you hear me soon
I live for you and I

Close to you, I want forever
But it won't last for you to do .. for what it was
Start it out, there's nothing new
Soon to be the beauty of our stars
Start it out, there's nothing new
Soon to be the beauty of our stars
Start it out, there's nothing new
Soon to be the beauty of our stars
