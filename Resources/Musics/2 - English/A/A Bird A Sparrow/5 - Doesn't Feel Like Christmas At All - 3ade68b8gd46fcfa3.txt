DOESN'T FEEL LIKE CHRISTMAS AT ALL

It’s getting so cold
The snow isn’t falling
All the lights are flickering on the Christmas tree
This year I’m wanting more than anything...it’s you
I want you by my side
Here with me

I’m good all year
So give me this one gift
The only thing that’s on my Christmas list

I’ll wait by my chimney and wait till I hear something
Crawling down the walls
Have you by my sweet heart
I’ve been waiting in the dark without you
I’ve been waiting in the dark
Without you here it doesn’t feel like Christmas at all

Remember when we used to walk through the city at night
We saw the Christmas tree go up along the San Francisco skyline
And you crawled up in a little space in my jacket
‘Cause you said that it’s your safest place that you’ve ever been in

But we didn’t even care that it was freezing
‘Cause I had the warmest heart that night
It felt amazing

I’ll wait by my chimney and wait till I hear something
Crawling down the walls
Have you by my sweet heart
I’ve been waiting in the dark
without you
I’ve been waiting in the dark
Without you here it doesn’t feel like Christmas at all
