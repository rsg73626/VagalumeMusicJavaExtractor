ONE (FINALE)

[Boys]
One singular sensation
Every little step he takes.
One thrilling combination
Every move that he makes.
One smile and suddenly nobody else will do;
You know you'll never be lonely with you know who.
One moment in his presence
And you can forget the rest.
For the guy is second best
To none,
Son.
Ooooh! Sigh! Give him your attention.
Do...I...really have to mention?
He's the One?
She walks into a room
And you know
[Girls]
She's un-

She walks into a room
And you know from her
Maddening pose, effortless whirl,

Can't, help,
All of her qualities extol-ling.
Loaded with charisma is my
Jauntily sauntering, ambling shambler.

And you know you must
Shuffle along, join the parade.
She's the quintessence of making the grade.
This is whatcha call
Trav-ling.
Oh, strut your stuff!
Can't get enough
Of her.
Love her.
I'm a son of a gun,
She is one of a
Kind...
