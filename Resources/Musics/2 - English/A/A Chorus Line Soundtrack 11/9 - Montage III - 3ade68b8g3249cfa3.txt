MONTAGE III

(Greg)
The worst thing in school was that everytime the teacher called on me
I’d be hard! I’d be hard!
Really!
I mean, I had to lean against the desk, like this. And the teacher would say
Stand up straight!
I can’t I have a pain in my... side!
Stand up straight!
Or walking down the halls, you’d have to walk, like this,
With all your books stacked up in front of you.
(Mike)
Yeah, I did too. I thought I was a sex maniac!
(Connie and Maggie)
You are!!
(Bobby)
Me too. It didn’t go down for three years.
(Greg)
Oh, and the bus. The bus was the worst. I’d take even one look at a bus and
Bingo!
And then there was the time I was making out with Sally Ketchum in the back seat of the car. We were kissing and necking and
I was feeling her boobs. And after about an hour or so,
she said,
Ohhh, don’t you wanna feel anything else?
And I suddenly thought to myself, ‘No, I don’t.’ Well, I guess yeah, because it was the first time I realized I was
homosexual. And I got so depressed, because I thought being gay meant being a bum all the rest of my life.
