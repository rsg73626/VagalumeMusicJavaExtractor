RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT ME TO BE

This is the first time
In a long time
That I've felt like
Coming home for the holidays

Everybody's wrote shit about
Why won't anybody hear me out?

My money's low
So instead I'll write you a song
Everyone will know
Everyone will know
So here it goes! (So hear it goes!)

Can you hear me?
I write so much
That it makes me sick
That it's all about you

Let's drop everything
And not come back til' next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be

I'm coming home for the bright lights
And the warm nights
Driving around with your friends
In your parents car

We're the ones that made it out
We're the ones they always talk about

My money's low
So instead I'll write you a song
Everyone will know
Everyone will know
So here it goes! (So hear it goes!)

Can you hear me?
I write so much
That it makes me sick
That it's all about you

Let's drop everything
And not come back til' next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be

What we've done, this year
It was the best times (it was the worst times)
But we built something here
Looking back on what we've done, this year
It was the best times (it was the worst times)
But we built something here!

Can you hear me?
I write so much
That it makes me sick
That it's all about you
Let's drop everything
And not come back til' next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be [x2]
