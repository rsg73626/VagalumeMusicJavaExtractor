HERE'S TO THE PAST

Let's all think back on what brought us here
This is my grasp on what is real
Don't tell me how I feel
With all that's passed I can't relate
With myself from day to day
why does everything seem so far away
to me

There's no turning back from here
I've got to get away from everyone who's left
Everyone who's left
I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
(Past year, past year...)
I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
(Past year, past year...)
They said we'd walk away
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself
they said we'd fade away

We've all been down this path before
You're trapped in this town
And it wears you down
When we leave today then maybe you'll understand
This constant struggle isn't always in the palm of our hand

There's no turning back from here
I've got to get away from everyone who's left
Everyone who's left
I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
(Past year, past year...)
I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
(Past year, past year...)
They said we'd walk away
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself
they said we'd fade away

This man will stand the test of time
This man will stand the test of time
This man will stand the test of time
This man will stand the test of time

I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
(Past year, past year...)
I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
(Past year, past year...)
They said we'd walk away
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself
they said we'd fade away
