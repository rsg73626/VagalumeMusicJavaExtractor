WHEN 3'S A CROWD

I went to sleep thinking about you
And I woke up just the same
You made it so hard for me
To close my eyes

Don't worry babe
This will be alright
In the end
And I'll be your everything

So we'll go tell ourselves
That this is for the best
But I'm depending on you
To lead me through

So try to stop those hands
You're riding down my neck
You touch, I tremble
You never were one to play fair

These past four walls won't be the only thing 
Thats keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So let's just take this time and
We'll use it for reflection
And I'll see you in 3 days and
You'll think of me when you're next to him

Don't mind my gasping
It's just so much harder to breathe when you're near
You made it so hard for me to learn through my eyes
Don't mind my asking
But could it trouble you miss for a smile?
So grant me one last wish with a kiss
Its what my dreams are made of

So we'll go tell ourselves
That this is for the best
But I'm depending on you
To lead me through

So try to stop those hands
You're riding down my neck
You touch, I tremble
You never were one to play fair

These past four walls won't be the only thing
That's keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So let's just take this time and
We'll use it for reflection
And I'll see you in 3 days and
You'll think of me when you're next to him

So here we are again
In the same situation
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
And you're not saying a word

Did you just say what you mean?
Why can't you just mean what you said
When you said
No one could love you like me

These past four walls won't be the only thing 
That's keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So lets just take this time and
We'll use it for reflection
And I'll see you in 3 days and
You'll think of me when you're next to him

These past four walls won't be the only thing
That's keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So lets just take this time and
We'll use it for reflection
And I'll see you in 3 days and
You'll think of me when you're next to him

(We could've been beautiful)
