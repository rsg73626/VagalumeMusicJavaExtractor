ALL I WANT

I'm always screaming my lungs out 
Till my head starts spinning. 
Playing my songs is the way i cope with life. 
Won't keep my voice down. 
Know the words I speak 
Are the thoughts i think out loud. 

I like to keep things honest. 
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it. 
For real. I'd hate to keep you all wondering. 
I'm constant like the seasons, 
And i will never be forgotten man.

Let's leave no words unspoken 
And save regrets for the broken. 
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own, 
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone 
Whoa you know to keep your hopes up high 
And your head down low.

Still got something left to prove. 
It tends to keep things movin'. 
While everyone around me says 
My last days are looming overhead 

But just what the hell do they think they know? 
I keep my head above the water 
While they drown in the undertow.

Let's leave no words unspoken 
And save regrets for the broken. 
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own, 
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone 
Whoa you know to keep your hopes up high 
And your head down low.

All I want is a place to call my own, 
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone 
Whoa you know to keep your hopes up high 
And your head down low.

If you take it from me, 
Live your life for yourself. 
Cause when it's all said and done 
You don't need anyone else.

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect. 
Not a worry in the world, 
So tell me was this all worth it? 

I get what I want, so everyone's always judging me. 
I'm not afraid of anything, 
And I've got the whole world in front of me.

All I want is a place to call my own, 
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone 
Whoa you know to keep your hopes up high 
And your head down low.

All I want is a place to call my own, 
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone 
Whoa you know to keep your hopes up high 
And your head down low.

Keep your heads down low
Keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high and your heads down low!
