THIS SUN HAS SET

This sun has set on your heart
Chances for redemption
And I have forgotten your name
And I thought it'd be easy
To move on completely
Forgetting what was real and what was

Forget the past
Don't for once think you're better than what I have
You're the reason I never trusted anyone
Forget the past
Don't for once think you're better than what I have
You're the reason I never trusted anyone

Just to forget
Wouldn't make me as happy as
It would to hate
Just to forgive is so much more
Than you are worth

Think the time I spent
Well so do I
And you
Tore
My life apart

Single breath
You could've cared less if I was dead
If I was dead

Just to forget
Wouldn't make me as happy as
It would to hate
Just to forgive is so much more
Than you are worth
Worth

You care so much
About yourself
That it makes me sick to think of you

Do you think how much I lost
For you?
