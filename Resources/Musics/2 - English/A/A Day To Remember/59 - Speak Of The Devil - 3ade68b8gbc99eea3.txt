SPEAK OF THE DEVIL

This is my vengeance for all the wrongs
You've formed against us
You always get me wrong
My whole existence revolves around the progress that we've made
I'll never be walked on again

I'm on the edge of the rooftop
Thinking nobody will ever know
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see
The distance from the road

This is our triumph over all the forms of filth 
you've spread
Well never let this go
Right from the very start I knew this day would come
Tonights the night we silence you
There's nowhere left to run

Let this be your reminder
I'm everything that you wanted to be
Hope for the best but it's over
And you thought you were better than me

Such a pretty picture
Your chalk line on the ground
I hope you die
