EXPOSED

I won't accept your fear
Another stagnant year
I'm pro-american but anti-politician
They'll trade you a voice
For an illusion of choice
Truth hits like a god damn premonition

Inroads to the hangman's noose
We got a lot to lose
Is this where you wanna be?
Exhumed they're not through
With you until you're left exposed
Is this who you wanna be?

Take what's been given or have none
The only claim of the workers in song
Get back in line you've all been warned
We was beat when we was born

Inroads to the hangman's noose
We got a lot to lose
Is this where you wanna be?
Exhumed they're not through
With you until you're left exposed
Is this who you wanna be?

Like a shark that's combing the surface
We got a taste for blood
Don't believe what the pacifist tells you
No war, no peace
