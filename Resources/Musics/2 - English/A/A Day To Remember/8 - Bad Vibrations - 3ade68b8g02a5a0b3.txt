BAD VIBRATIONS

Don't forget that this is a choice
Pick your poison
Live with remorse

I could burn a hole with my eyes that cuts straight through the skin
No more love, no more resolution
It's getting harder bearing the darkness within
I gotta let it out
I'm gonna let it

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am

This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day

It's like a fog surrounds me applyin pressure within
Weighing me down, seeing in double vision
It hits so hard I stu- stu- stutter my speech
Ya go kinda cold inside
Dancing on thin ice

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am

This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day

Toxic
Toxic
Toxic

This darkness, this darkness
Leaves me empty like
I am the heartless

Toxic
Toxic within
