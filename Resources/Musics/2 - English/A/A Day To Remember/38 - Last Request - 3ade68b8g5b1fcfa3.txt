LAST REQUEST

They noticed the ways you changed
over the years,but we all stayed the same
look back through the past
but we all knew that you wouldn't last

You see yourself in the puddles left from the rain
but all we remember is your stain
Just live your life, live it for yourself and be happy
So your wrong, in the ways you wanted to be
the only one who matters is you

Now watch you slip away
to the ledge you've chosen finally
you picked your role now play your part
but what you didn't know this plays a tragedy

You see yourself in the puddles left from the rain
but all we remember is your stain
just live your life, live it for yourself and be happy
So your wrong, in the ways you wanted to be
the only one who matters is you

What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we was coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we was coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we was coming from

Cause it breaks,my heart
Cause it breaks my heart
Cause it breaks my heart
Cause it breaks

just live your life, live it for yourself and be happy
So your wrong, in the ways you wanted to be
the only one who matters is

What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we was coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we was coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we was coming from
