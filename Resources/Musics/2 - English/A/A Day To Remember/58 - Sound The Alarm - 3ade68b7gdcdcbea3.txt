SOUND THE ALARM

Iâ€™m your alpha, and omega, I am invincible.
Can I just say one more thing?
I'm not going to say you know there's plenty more fish in the sea
I'm not going to say if you love her let her go
and I'm not going to bombard you with cliches
but I will say this:
Its the end of the world
