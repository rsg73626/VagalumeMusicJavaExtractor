YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE

They used to tell me you got to choose a side
Now it's four years later and they beg for advise
Don't trust the critic he's a cynic
Make the call for yourself
This is my ten step course not to be like everyone else

And I know it's not the easiest route
And I know it leaves you overflowing with doubt
But if you want it you can have it
I hope it's all that you dreamed
'Cause once you got it you're gonna get it
You won't be leaving this

You can't trust everyone you meet, 
they won't amount to anything
Go tell them, go tell them, It's not as simple as you think
You can't trust everyone you meet, 
they never meant that much to me
Go tell them, go tell them, It's not as simple as you think

Clenched fists, held above me, 
you will never bring me to my knees

I said!

Clenched fists, held above me, 
you will never bring me to my knees

You get what you deserve
