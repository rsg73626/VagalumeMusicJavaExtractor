THE DOWNFALL OF US ALL

Da da da de da da da
Da da da de da da da
Let's go

It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have some fun and never change that for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone

Oooh

I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone
You won't find me in the same spot believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all.

I'm gonna need you to try to follow along.
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs.
Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed.
I write what I feel, I say what I mean
You can't buy sincerity

Oooh

I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone
You won't find me in the same spot believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all.

Don't forget yourselves we made up our minds
We signed 3, 4, 5 on that dotted line X2

You won't find me in the same spot believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks I'm leavin' and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong

You won't find me in the same spot believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all, this town will be the downfall of us all.

DOWNFALL OF US ALL X4
