THE BRAVE

There are no sides to choose from, just things to hate. And I for one, hate myself today.

Bring me down

Don't listen to me, if you're not ready, cuz bravery means more then just fighting.

Shoot and kill, it's dead and gone. Now please, just forget me.
Famous or Infamous, I've made my mark. And this is where I stand.

I have heard bravery is a ghostown thats nice to visit. Who wants to stick around and play the mayor with me?

Today cowardice comes so easily, and my friend, failure comes naturally to me. I've been knocked down before, time to get the fuck up


This is past the point of words. So grab your guns, and follow me... 
(I just wish everything were this easy. I just wish everything were like this)
