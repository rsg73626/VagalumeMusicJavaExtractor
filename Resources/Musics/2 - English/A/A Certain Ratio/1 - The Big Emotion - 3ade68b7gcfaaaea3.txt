THE BIG EMOTION

When you're sick and tired of everybody lying to you
You just want to walk awa
Walk right into better days
If you can just stop wanting i
It will come to you
I know you tr
But don't try to hard
When i see you cry
It breaks my heart

I won't stop loving yo
I still believe in you
When everything goes wron
You think you're on your own
I won't stop loving you
I won't stop loving you

In this changing times
You see yourself on the outside
It's getting harder to find your way
You're living in hope from day to day
If you can laugh in spite of it
There's nothing you can't do
I know you try
But don't try to hard
When you lie to me
You break my heart

I won't stop loving you
I still believe in you
When everything goes wrong
You think you're on your own
I won't stop loving you
I won't stop loving you

You just can't take it anymore
And then again
A lost cause is the only one worth fighting for!!!!!

I won't stop loving you
I still believe in you
When everything goes wrong
You think you're on your own
I won't stop loving you
I won't stop loving you
