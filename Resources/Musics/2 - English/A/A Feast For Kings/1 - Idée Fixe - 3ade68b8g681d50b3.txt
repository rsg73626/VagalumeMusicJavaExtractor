IDÃ‰E FIXE

Splintering into the very fibers
Of who I once was
I'm disappearing like a fog
It isn't easy to recognize me

I was born from the dirt
To dirt is where I will return
This is self medicated therapy
This is who I never wanted to be
Smoked out by the thief in me

I stole my own, own future I
I stole my own path to survival I
I stole my own, own future I
I sold every part of me
To something empty

Let me take a hit for the last time
There's something 'bout it
I can't deny
I get that feeling in my bones
It's just too hard to let go
Let me take a sip for the last time
There's something 'bout it
I can't deny
Withdrawals are creeping and
I guess this means I lose again

Countless times of hanging
My head in shame
I'm torn up by the lie
'Lets live it up'
I've got nothing, got nothing
To move on when the sun comes up
Countless times of tying
The noose again
I'm torn up by the lie
'Lets live it up'
I breathe nothing, mean nothing
To anyone but I just can't stop

I give up
Break me
A hundred times and
A hundred more
I want this but I need you more
Hear me
I may speak with
A weak voice
But your power shines through
My weakness

This is my final cry for help
God guide me through
This salted path
You're the only who hasn't left
You're the only one that I have left
Please hear me

Let me take a hit for the last time
There's something 'bout it
I can't deny
I get that feeling in my bones
It's just too hard to let go
Let me take a sip for the last time
There's something 'bout it
I can't deny
Withdrawals are creeping and
I guess this means I lose again

Don't take that hit when you
Said you've quit
Don't take that, don't take that
