TO LOVE IS TO LIE

Passing on,
one of lifes most precious lessons we learned today,
beyond our souls' decay,
you wander past the rolling side to see the light (to see the light) of everything youve dropped and fell behind,
to fly away (to fly away), its hard to feel alive,
when the ones you love are right there by your side,
to make you feel alright (make you feel alright) when you see things out tonight,
just remember those who follow close behind when we let ourselves unwind (let ourselves unwind) and its a hard day when you inwind and finding light to let you go inside theres many to collide and we cant be gone for a long time and we cannot wait for anything at all,
anything at all,
we've all been loved anything weve held,
let down or betrayed,
to hide our souls away we wander past this in disguise to see the light (to see the light),
of everything weve dropped or fell behind,
to fly away(fly away)its hard to feel alive,
When the ones you love are right there by your side,
to make you feel alright (make you feel alright) when you see things out tonight,
just remember those who follow close behind when we let ourselves unwind (let ourselves unwind)and its all the same when you inwind that the lines we made are meant to go inside,
theyre many to collide and we cant be gone for a long time and we cannot wait for anything at all,
anything at all its hard to feel alive,
when the ones you love are right there by your side,
to make you feel alright (make you feel alright) when you see things out tonight,
just remember those who follow close behind when we let ourselves unwind (let ourselves unwind) let ourselves unwind
