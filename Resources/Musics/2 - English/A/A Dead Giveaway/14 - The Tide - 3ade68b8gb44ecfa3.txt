THE TIDE

Hey couldn't you see the despair in his eyes
I know you did
Why didn't you speak it out
Why didn't you scream out loud

I can hear you say
But as we know
You like to preach
But are last in line

Hey when you fall down i'll be there
You know i am
Shout my name out lout
Shout and i'll be there

I can hear you say
But as we know
You like to brag
But are last in line

Be the first now
Show me just one step ahead
I wanna hear you shout out
Show me what your made off

Together we're strong enough
No one will push us down
So stand up raise your fist
Show them what you've got

I can hear you shout
I can see your fist
But all alone
You are last in line

Be the first now
Show me just one step ahead
I wanna hear you shout out
Show me what your made off
