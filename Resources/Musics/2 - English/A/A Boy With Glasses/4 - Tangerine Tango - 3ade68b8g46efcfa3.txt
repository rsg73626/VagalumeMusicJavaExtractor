TANGERINE TANGO

Salt and pepper chips
You've got juicy lips
but I'm way too shy
To try to kiss

You shake those hips
You give me the fits
I've got a devil inside
He's calling the hits

You say "Mon Dieu
That man's a brute
He looks at me with a fire
But he's cute."

Oh, we all know
That men, they come and go
So, don't worry, dear
You'll find another one
Come next year
Alright

Can I buy you a drink?
I know what you think
If it's only sex
I am out in a blink

We can talk about love
Do you like romance?
What you say I take your hand
Let's go start to dance

You say, "Mon Dieu
He's got the moves
Maybe I've found the one
Whose not just plain dirt."

Oh, we all know
That men, they come and go
So, don't worry, dear
You'll find another one
Come next year

Salt and pepper and chips
You've got juicy lips
But I'm way too shy
To try to kiss

You sure got class
When you wiggle that ass
I'm so sorry,
But I never act like this

You say, "Mon Dieu
This man's got heat
Let's try it out
And see if he's to keep."

Oh, we all know
That men, they come and go
So, don't worry, dear
You'll find another one
Come next year (x2)
