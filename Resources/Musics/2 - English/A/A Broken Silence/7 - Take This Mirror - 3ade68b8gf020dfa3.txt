TAKE THIS MIRROR

It's like a gamble to do what's right ( show us the light), but
one hand must throw that dice ( trust inside), many try to obstruct ya eyes (from the light)
but when we gone will come the time ( to justify), better get up on ya
feet and run home my friend, got so many peoples but you alone again,
trying to switch but you on that road again, alone again, alone again,
it's a cold cold world yeah I know the trends, we lose sight of on
what we should be focusing, and wonder why the walls be closing
in, Slowly this what I've been noticing......

Chorus

Do we really got to do the shit that we do (a question i
consider), should I bother with it all or be drifting through (what
will effort deliver) will the struggle be in vain to bring the truth
( enough to change an era) if its hard to see where we at now, here
please take this mirror........

I see the beauty in the world, I'm no pessimist, is it my
duty to reveal where we heading quick, trying to hold, but steady
watching heaven slip, did I contribute, what am I gonna tell my kids,
many caught up in the mix, trying to get by, over this whole shit,
just want to, get high, many around the globe looking in deaths eyes,
fed up hoping to get to the next life, but do we really know what
stress is like, from this planet man we're standing on the best side,
humanity the link we connect by, how much of our family we gonna, let
die, do we point at governments and how they toyed with us, can't even
fish in these rivers now they poisonous, we all felt the temperatures
boiling up, still we ain't content, we ain't destroyed enough....

Chorus

Do we really got to do the shit that we do (a question i
consider), should I bother with it all or be drifting through (what
will effort deliver) will the struggle be in vain to bring the truth
( enough to change an era) if its hard to see where we at now, here
please take this mirror........(Twice)
