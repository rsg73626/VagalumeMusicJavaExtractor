CAUGHT UP IN FICTION

I was caught up in fiction I lied to the world, told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore...
(a renegade gotta face a change, stay away from them wasted days now break)

Man, this the life of the cool folks and them cliché muso's reach for that ouzo, keep drinking till that booze goes, travelled more then a few roads, worn are my shoe soles, some rapping for that kulo, I stayed glad with the kudos, grabbing at fools gold, from that spot I couldn't move no, pinned back like judo, trapped... robinson crusoe. we always blazed on the weekdays and we normally sleep late pause then we replay. sort of thought there'd never be change but now I like my b' day for torcha it's d-day. we always blazed on the weekdays and we normally sleep late, pause then we replay. sorta thought there'd never be change but now I like my b'day for torcha it's d-day.

We got props for them hot bars, been on dust like rock stars cuffed up in cop cars, screaming out they should stop war but every spot that we pub crawl none stop got brawls. many chasing that feeling and by age twenty-eight probably wasted a million. from this day dig my heals in, I'll never be bill gates but I'm gonna build for my children, so what it took to be a man now is put some plans down, never look for them hand outs. now torch in the cockpit, what's more it's a rocket, we off, watch this... many thinking you’re at loss kid, piss poor were them options naught in my pockets. many thinking your at loss kid, piss poor were them options naught in my pockets. many thinking you’re at loss kid, piss poor were them options naught in my pockets. since the call from the doctors, I had my bad thoughts packed all into boxes.
