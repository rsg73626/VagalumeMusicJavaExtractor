A WALK ALONE

cheers to life 
and moments when they define
what broken hearts can t deny.
and to hope
sincerest in it s design
yet manifested to blind

and my eyes, they can t always see the lie
yeah sometimes it s hard to find

and what more do you want from me
i ve given every part of me.
the closest things are hard to see.

here s to spite
vindictive in it s design
the shallowest part of mind
cheers to love
the ocean that does divide
but sometimes it s hard to find

and what more do you want from me
i ve given everything you see.
the closest things are hard to see

and my eyes,
they can t always see the light
yeah sometimes it s hard to find
and my eyes,
they can t always read your mind
yeah sometimes it hard to fight

in my head I kill the lie, I kill the lie
in my head I kill the lie, I kill the lie and walk alone

and my eyes, they can t always see the lie
yeah, sometimes it s hard to find.
