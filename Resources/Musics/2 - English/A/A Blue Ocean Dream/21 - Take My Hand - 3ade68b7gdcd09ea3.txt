TAKE MY HAND

There's a change in the weather, I will stay here
forever,
There's a chill in the air, you are out there
somewhere 
Tive me something to believe in, I feel weak when I
give in.

When I see, I see your heart, when this world just
falls apart.
Take my hand, Take my hand
And it will be alright.
