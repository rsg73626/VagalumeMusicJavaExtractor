PRETENDING

Nah nah nah
Nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah-nah nahyeah-yeah, yeah yeah

Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
That I don't need your love
It's been a long week, don't try to stop me
Don't stop 'til the liquor's done
I don't need pussy, yeah I'ma flex it
And buy it for everyone
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
My baby won't pick up

Hm, sorry if I don't pick up
I was off that 42 and yeah, I'm still fucked up
I'm just like you, you're just like me, and they all just like us
I was only 13, Arkies let me buy my Dutch
I need that Yaris, 'bout to go and get that Lambo truck (skrt)
Skrrt off try to merc us, they might get merced first
I got a fox up in my coat, and it got real fox fur
It's 5am and I've been drinkin' so my words might slur, yeah

Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
(That I don't need your love)
It's been a long week, don't try to stop me
(Don't stop 'til the liquor's done)
I don't need pussy, yeah I'ma flex it
(And buy it for everyone)
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
My baby won't pick up

They'll probably think we're pretending, they won't believe us
Creepin' and hopin' nobody seen us
Let me show you how like every pair of sneaker
But every time I saw you I would freeze up
If I write you more than once would I be beastin', hm
Fuck a triple date, let's have a threesome, hm
Fuck you in your face might have you leakin', hm
She love my diamond chains and all my pieces, hm

Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
(That I don't need your love)
It's been a long week, don't try to stop me
(Don't stop 'til the liquor's done)
I don't need pussy, yeah I'ma flex it
(And buy it for everyone)
Yes I've been drinking, yes I'm pretending
My baby won't pick up
