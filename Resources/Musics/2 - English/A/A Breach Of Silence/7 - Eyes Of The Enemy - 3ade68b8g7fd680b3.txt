EYES OF THE ENEMY

Taking it back to see what you believe in
All hope is gone retrieving the visions
Hopeless and lifeless returning to fate
Abundance of numbness I shall not embrace

I stand facing the dark within blood on the walls
Stains of such pain taking it all to the grave
So how would you be too see the eyes of the enemy
This is my life in your eyes through the eyes of the enemy
This is your time too rise in the eyes of the enemy

Hands on your throat, breathless you choke
Bruises and scars cover your essence
With bleeding hearts I take your essence
Knife in the back so close to fading
Treacheries hold it's you that I'm taking

I stand facing the dark within blood on the walls
Stains of such pain taking it all to the grave
So how would you be too see the eyes of the enemy
This is my life in your eyes through the eyes of the enemy
This is your time too rise in the eyes of the enemy

This means war
Your truth be told
It's carved in stone
This means war

In the eyes of the enemy
This means war
In the eyes of the enemy
In the eyes of the enemy
