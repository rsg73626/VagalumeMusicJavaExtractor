TIME STILL REMAINS

As we journey through the void of time and space
Darkened path of answers I cannot retrace
Look upwards to the midnight starry sky
Realize the bigger picture within its eyes

Your eyes unveil the map of everything
Perception tangles dreams, your mind, it sings
Behold infinity, what time will bring
The wisdom to behold life's true meaning

Time still remains
These broken words can't save the day
Fate to be explained
Earth is bound to what remains
We venture forward blind

We fail to see
Marching to the drum of mediocrity
Connected to everything we hear
He cries of our inner souls
Because we realize that

Time still remains
These broken words can't save the day
Fate to be explained
Earth is bound to what remains

Time still remains
Hese broken words can't save the day
Fate to be explained
Earth is bound to what remains

Time still remains
These broken words can't save the day
Fate to be explained
Earth is bound to what remains
