EMPTY SMILE

Your blood is haunting me
My only chance to redeem the call
Come forth my enemies
Your eyes will never see the dawn
Behind the silhouette
The only one too deny the dead
An empty smile still haunts my dreams and memories
An empty smile still haunts my dreams and memories

Before you take my head
You shall repay with your blood
Before you take me down
The axe wielding in your hand comes down
Forgive me with the mask
That hides your smile
An empty smile still haunts my dreams in memories
An empty smile still haunts my dreams in memories

Your blood frozen cold
My life will sail ashore
From which we remain
My life will sail ashore
From which it shall remain
Do you remember (do you remember)
I fucking remember (fucking remember)
For every time
Your heart needs remedy
For every time
Your heart needs remedy

And for virtue
Your heart needs remedy
And my heart screams
Your heart needs remedy
