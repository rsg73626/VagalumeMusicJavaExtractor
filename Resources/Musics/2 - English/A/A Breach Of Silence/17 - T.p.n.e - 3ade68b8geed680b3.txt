T.P.N.E

Tpne the party never ends
Tpne the party never ends
Drink it down tonight
Drink till morning light

Still no end in sight
Every night like this
We fxcking love this shit
There's no stopping out here

Another round of shots for me and the boys
We'll drink all fucking night
We've got nothing to lose
So fill it up, fill it up to the top

'Cause tonight we're gonna party
Like bon fucking scott
Time to drink and friends this rounds on me
Tonight we drink our sorrows out to sea

Drink it down tonight
Drink till morning light
Still no end in sight
Every night like this

We fucking love this shit
There's no stopping out here
The night is still so young
But we are so fucked up

We came to party and we will not stop
Living on endless roads
Now we're so far from home

When the lights go out
Welcome to the show
When the lights go out
Welcome to the show

Time to drink and friends this rounds on me
Tonight we drink our sorrows out to sea
Tonight we drink our sorrows out to sea

This night will be one to remember
Tonight we will never surrender
This night will be one to remember
Tonight we will never surrender

Tpne the party never ends
Tpne the party never ends
Tpne the party never ends
Wasted

Let's get loose
And freak out everyone in the room
Forget what you were going to say
And party till the very next day

Time to drink and friends this rounds on me
Tonight we drink our sorrows out to sea
Tonight we drink our sorrows out to sea

Drink it down tonight
Drink till morning light
Still no end in sight
Every night like this
We fucking love this shxt
There's no stopping out here
