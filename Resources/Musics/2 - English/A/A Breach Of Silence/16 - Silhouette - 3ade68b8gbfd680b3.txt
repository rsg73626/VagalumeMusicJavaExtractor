SILHOUETTE

This world is in the palm of our hands tonight
No rest for the wicked
Wake up. Lost in this moment
Take my hand. We will burn this fucking city down
I swear that I will never let you go

I'll show you mine (I'll show you mine)
If you show me yours (if you show me yours)
Wake up
Salvation
Spread your wings and carry on
Let go of this affliction
Shine bright like a fucking star
Take this burden
Forever in your heart
And set it free

I can't remember anything about last night
So much for endless dreams
Wake up
Salvation
Spread your wings and carry on
Let go of this affliction
Shine bright like a fucking star
You're so lost in my head
I promise this is all I breathe

Nothing
Nothing could ever take this from me
I can't feel the ground beneath my feet
This is everything to me

It's all I breathe. It's all I breathe
I will fall to my knees
I won't learn from my mistakes
I will fall to my knees
I won't learn from my mistakes

This world is in the palm of our hands tonight
No rest for the wicked
Wake up
You're so lost in my head
I promise this is all I breathe
Nothing
Nothing could ever take this from me
