DEAD AND DESTROYED

My ears are open, talk to me
Share your stories
Your passions and your disbeliefs
You can't run, you can't hide
Believe me I've tried
Believe me I've tried
Don't listen to their lies

Don't you dare fall down
I'm here by your side this time
To fight. To make it alright
To keep you alive
To keep you alive tonight
How can I function when nothing makes sense?
Feeling so dead and destroyed
Following paths that lead us to dead ends
Feeling so dead and destroyed

These demons
These demons will die
Gain direction
Defeat complication
Interaction, face to face

Don't let the world drag you six feet under
Reach out your hand, and take hold of mine
How can I function when nothing makes sense?
Feeling so dead and destroyed
Following paths that lead us to dead ends
Feeling so dead and destroyed

Gain direction
Defeat complication
Interaction, face to face
Don't let the world drag you six feet under
Reach out your hand, and take hold of mine
How can I function when nothing makes sense?

Feeling so dead and destroyed
Following paths that lead us to dead ends
Feeling so dead and destroyed
How can I function when nothing makes sense?

Feeling so dead and destroyed
Following paths that lead us to dead ends
Feeling so dead and destroyed
Don't listen to their lies
Don't you dare fall down
I'm here by your side this time
