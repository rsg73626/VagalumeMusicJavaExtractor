LIKE SANDS THROUGH THE HOUR GLASS

The time has come to torture me
Before I'm faded in this dream
My time left in this world there no remorse
For everyone to see

There's nothing left
A solemn vow is where I burn
Before the dawn
Before the light

And you and everyone you can see
Before they rape your eyes
Taking back what's mine (do you remember?)
Visions redefined (do you recall?)
Grasping with both hands
Retrace my footsteps in the sand

Are you ready?
Another minute passes through me
An endless glass that never stops
There no remorse just broken bones
There nothing left for me

This fragile glass is where it rains
Is where I pay
Taking back what's mine (do you remember?)
Visions redefined (do you recall?)
Grasping with both hands
Retrace my footsteps in the sand

I remember exactly what you said to me
Trust me and see
This is me telling you to leave
I try so hard every day to breath

My time has come to say goodbye
The sand falls in this glass of mine
But I can't find the answers
That I need to break free

(This hour glass, I'll smash)
From these binds that hold me to the ground
Taking back what's mine
Visions redefined
Grasping with both hands
Retrace my footsteps in the sand
