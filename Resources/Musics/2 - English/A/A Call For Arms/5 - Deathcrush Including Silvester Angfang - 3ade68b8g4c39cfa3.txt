DEATHCRUSH INCLUDING SILVESTER ANGFANG

Demonic laughter your cremation
Your lungs gasp for air but are filled with blood
A sudden crack as I crushed your skull
The remind of your life flashes by
A life that soon won't be
Smiling with axe in my hand
Evil's rotten hand you'll see
I come forward
Deathcrush
I'll send you to your maker
I'll send you to your death
Death nicely crucified
Death, heads on stakes
The barbeque has just begun
Deathcrush - Deathcrush - Deathcrush
Crush - Crush
Deathcrush
Deathcrush
Deathcrush
