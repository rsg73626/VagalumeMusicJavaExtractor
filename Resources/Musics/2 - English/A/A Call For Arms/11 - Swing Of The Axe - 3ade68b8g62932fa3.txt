SWING OF THE AXE

Ripping tearing slashing the axe
The blood starts to flow the axe of pain
Running for safety eyes start to bleed
Red is the sight of evil pain
Swing of the axe the curse is on you
Returning to take you away
Swing of the axe your evil deeds
Friend of Satan he will succeed
You had your choice
You chose your ways
You took the devil he's wrong
Your mind is mistaken
Your soul has been taken
Your brain's been twisted and lost
I can see
The river of flames
Where you'll be cast and thrown
Heavens of fire
At Satan's desire
Hell is now your home
Sin after sin
Your brains are crushed in
This is the way that you want
Wrong from the start
You weren't so smart
Making the choice that will haunt
