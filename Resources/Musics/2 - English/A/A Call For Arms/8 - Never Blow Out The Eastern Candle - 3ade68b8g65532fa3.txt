NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE

Never Blow Out The Eastern Candle
Your five-fold kiss was rather invoking;
Beside the chancel is your unphallic wand,
And use it wisely in order to fly.
MOONFIRE!
ALLAXITOS!
My jewel is the lust from your kiss;
Your breasts made me the lover of the three-fold locus,
So take thy hand and join me for elixir,
And we shall ride the portentous serpent tonight.
Your five fold tongue has defiled me,
I'm stranded by the tree of Storax
Thus, we banish your unphallic wand,
In order to make our nexus ecstasy
MOONFIRE!
CUM TO ME.
ALLAXITOS!
CUM WITH THEE.
NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE!
NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE!
NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE!
FOREVER
