STRAIGHT FROM THE MIND OF THE MODERN DAY VIGILANTE

Fly for the door 
I 
can taste those 
glands of fear 
you extract yourself 
as 
I still draw 
near 
a target fixated 
on 
your face so 
closed casket is necessary 
safe haven is so far away 
soon the hounds will search 
and smell you rotten and decayed 
decomposing in this 
earth..I...still...share...no...remorse...for...helping...you...to....become....a....corpse... 
I wanted this for so long Im ecstatic 
deception I'll bleed you dry 
all eight pints pumping from your throat you grow faint as I speak now I am known 
I could push you a thousand times from the highest tower you should have seen this coming you fucking coward 
live another second to see disgust in my eyes 
this is what you get for taking innocence from their lives 
you wont be forgotten your mutilation was not an option so dead now Im relieved 
fly for the door 
I 
can taste those 
glands of fear 
you extract yourself 
as 
I still draw 
near 
a target fixated 
on your face
