THE ACCIDENTIST

A cheap suffocation.
A bloody genocide.
I feel your breath escaping.
This time it won't take long.
Bringing all to ruin,
I will set flames unto the body
that lies undone
and when your life passes through your eyes
I won't remember you or your disgusting fate
the unyielding fear the relentless pain.
I won't remember you.
I'll rip your body up.
And slam it to theground.
There's fear inside your eyes.
There's no escaping now.
I said to bring the bullets.
You said you'd bring them all.
You said you'd bring the bullets.
I'll watch your bodies fall.
I'll rip your body up.
And slam it to the ground.
There's fear inside your eyes.
There's no escaping now.
I won't think of you, Or your disgusting fate.
The unyielding fear.
The relentless pain.
Run out your guns!
Your ship is sinking!
Run out your guns!
This is the day!
Run out your guns!
Your ship is sinking!
Run out your guns!
Lets make this a massacre!
