I, COLOSSUS

Who dare disturb me?!
Who seeks to destroy
what I've worked my life to forget?!
Treason!
You tread on the throne of a giant, a god among men.
My hammer will deliver justice to those who oppose my power. My sword will cut through the deepest strength
and the strongest will.
Back down! Tremble!
It is I, the harbinger of death.
My hammer will deliver justice to those who oppose my power. My sword will cut through the deepest strength
and the strongest will.
My wrath does not forgive.
It does not forget.
Send me your men of valor.
Send me your greatest warrior!
No race nor creed or class nor gender will be spared.
Abandon hope.
You'll beg, you'll scream, you'll choke. Titan!
