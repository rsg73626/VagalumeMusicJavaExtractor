I WISH I COULD WRITE LIKE YOU

I read those words again for the third time today
You make it sound so simple and yet so complex
My hearts always hidden behind metaphors
But why hide when I know you feel the same?
I won't describe you as a sunset, a shadow or a star
I'll just whisper softly through the speakers
To tell you what only simple words could say
How I long for the weekend and the smile that I never see on Thursdays
We'll wander the streets like we have nowhere to go
But you always bring me home so that we can be alone
I'll jump the fence one more time
And we'll stand on the other side
In the sheltered shadow of a backyard fence
And I'll kiss you like I meant it
I hope you know I meant it...
....And oh, how I wish I could write like you
Your words are such sweet perfection
So simple and delicate, but yet written so true
I only wish I could write like you
But my hearts always hidden by a metaphor
And I wonder what all those intricate words are for
Why hide behind design when I know you feel the same
I didn't hide behind a sunset, a shadow or a star
I only explained things how they are
Real...
