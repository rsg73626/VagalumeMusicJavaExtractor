THE ONLY SLOW SONG ON THE RECORD

you a such a sucker for my sweet talk
i love the way your eys fall to the floor
when i say "i love you"
i love the way your bones begin to shake the second i take your hand in mine
oh, scream safe silence
oh, scream sweet safety
you love the way i say your name (with a smile)
you love the way the words roll off my tounge (like they were meant to)
you love the way i make you feel secure
(well your always right)
and you are such a sucker for anything poetic
i love the way your heart can skip a beat
when you think of me
the way we never found the words to say....
...you are such a sucker for anything acoustic...
...(I love the way we never found the words to say)
you love the way i say your name (with a smile)
you love the way the words roll off my tounge (like they were meant to)
you love the way i make you feel secure
(well your always right)...
...and you are, you are such a sucker for anything acoustic...
