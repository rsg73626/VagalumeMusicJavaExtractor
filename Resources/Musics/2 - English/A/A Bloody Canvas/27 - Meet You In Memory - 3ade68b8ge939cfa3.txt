MEET YOU IN MEMORY

i cant forget you, i cant forget you
tonight we'll dance upon the memories
flirting with disaster, get my heart beating faster
theres something missing everytime i take a breath, theres one thing mising everytime i fall asleep
theres an unexplainable hole in my chest from that night when i found you at your best...
...such a clever conduction of a constant mistake, i'll hold onto you until i feel my mind start to break, i cant forget you, i cant forget you...
...all the memories locked tight inside a cheap paper bag, when i wake up in the morning this day will go on, like a cleverly conduted constant mistake, i wont be letting go unless my mind starts to break...
...and now my cerebrum will shatter with my memory lapse, spilling such an awful secretion into my skull, i tried to hold on while my mind was wiped clean, now all i have left are my intangible dreams..
...i'll meet you in memory
(i cant forget you)
i cant remember your name
