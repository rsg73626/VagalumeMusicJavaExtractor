FROM WINTER TO SPRING

To feel the grace of spring upon our lips
Is like the simple echo of a breeze
Dancing off scen’ry, dancing off the trees,
I traced your silent lifelines with the tips
Of my fingers as the water did drip
Past rocks of that river, past them with ease,
How perfect the moment! You here with me
Whisper to me, my love, about the slip
From winter to spring, the seasons they change
As does the weather, the air so serene
An infinite presence, the air we breathe
I wish I could paint this beautiful scene
Alas, I know nothing of art, ‘tis strange
Only a poet with hearts on my sleeves.
