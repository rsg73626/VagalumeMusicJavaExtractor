AT LEAST I FORGET DREAMS WHEN I WAKE UP

you deserve only the best
a silver bullet shot straight through your chest
so you wont infest my dreams tonight
(your my biggest mistake, my biggest regret)
now on the darkest night when the moon is full and the stars are standing still
i'll have to kill what i created...
...you are every childhood dream gone bad
i could of said 'fuck you' from the start though i bet you wish i had, you are a nightmare constantly haunting my mind, i'm so scared to fall asleep unahwere of what i'll find...
...crawling out of your coffin with bloodlust in your brain, your determined to tear my life apart, if i cant stop you i'll just drive this stake straight through your heart, to watch you wither away like a withering rose, turning from such a beautiful red into something thats better of dead...
...your a monster, a terrible myth, its nothing greek but it makes my voice go weak, silence and sweat, my biggest regret, you are every childhood dream gone bad, you are hell, well i can tell, a recurring dream just like each halloween night i spent under the covers, i'd trick or treat for something sweet, heres the trick, you were too sweet, you are every childhood dream gone bad
