GIFTED

Maybe im alone, in all of this
Or maybe its something, that we just missed
Its gone on to long, to sad words
For this song, throw another four letter smile out
Go away, i dont think we can be friend

What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted

Taken awhile to write, all this down
Its been a long time, since ive heard a sound
Its gone on to long, to sad words
For this song, throw another four letter smile out
Go away, i dont think we can be friend

What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted

After all this time
Go away, i dont think we can be friend

What makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted
What Makes you think
your gifted
What makes you think
your gifted
