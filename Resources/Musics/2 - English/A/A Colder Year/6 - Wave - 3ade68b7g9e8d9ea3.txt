WAVE

(verse 1)
i shouldn't find this funny
but maybe after all
i'm crawling and i'm spitting
down on the stairs in the hall

(chorus) x 2
but i'll wave when i'm gone from here
i'll turn the lights on and disappear

(verse 2)
i talk when words are ugly just to make sense of the floor
and i cant see through the smoke, or i can't breathe anymore

(chorus)

but i'll, i'll set you, set you on fire
burning trees break her heart
i wont leave too soon
just shine
down shine
shine down

(chorus)
