GOLDEN TEETH AND SILVER MEDALS

Nina Persson:
Anybody tell you that there is no resale value
When your romance goes to hell
You better say farewell to what you thought was wealth

Nikolai Dunger:
Ever get the feeling that the paint has started peeling
Are you staring at the ceiling of your castle
Dreaming that you're someone else

Nina: Would you like to meet me in this song
Nikolai: I've been hoping to
Nina: Would you like to come and prove me wrong
Nikolai: No, I'm agreeing with you

Both:
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we've got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we've got

Nina:
Maybe if I had another drink
I'd see the pattern
In the blinking of the traffic lights
Do you think you're helping, Nikolai

Nikolai:
I don't know the answer, Nina
Life is like a melody
A pendulum that swings between a major and a minor
It's a lullaby

Nina: Now I'm so glad I met you in this song
Nikolai: Suggest a breath I blow (?)
Nina: I'm so glad you're here to sing along
Nikolai: My voice into the floor

Both:
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we've got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we've got

Nina: I'm a little weary that the worst is yet to come
Nikolai: I'm afraid they'll leave us out here, melting in the sun
Nina: We'll be second best until we know
Both: We have won

Nina: But until we do, we'll sing this song
Nikolai: Till I know we won
Nina: We'll sing until our need for it is gone
Nikolai: We'll be singing this song

Both:
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we've got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we've got

Both:
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we've got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we've got
