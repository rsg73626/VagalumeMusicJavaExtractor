I SIGNED THE LINE

Don't send me letters in bottles anymore
And don't come a-knocking or darken my door
We've got a contract, devotion evermore
We're legally bonded in richness and in poor

I signed the line that was dotted
I'd like to end what I started
I signed the line and I realize
A lot of lies were written in letters
In bottles that tend to run aground

Don't give me platinum
To weight down my wrist
I've got injunctions
So cease and desist
I've got a bottle, a ball and the chain
But you have that one thing about you that remains

I signed the line that was dotted
I like end what I started
Thereâ€™s too much I need
I've got to plead insanity
So don't give me platinum
It's just weighs me down
I signed the line
And I realize a lot of lies
Were written in letters
In bottles that tend to run aground
