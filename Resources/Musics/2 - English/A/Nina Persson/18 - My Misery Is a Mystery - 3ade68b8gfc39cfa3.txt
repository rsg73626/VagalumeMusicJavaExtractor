MY MISERY IS A MYSTERY

Oh, my misery is a mystery
She’s my mistress when she’s with me
And I miss her when she’s history
Oh, my misery is a mystery

Oh, mysterious delirious
Why is happiness so furious?
And it is tiring to be curious
My euphoria is dangerous

Oh, how glorious to sleep
In between our raging days
It’s the sweetest relief

Holy moses, life is roses
Just be vary of the process
Give it water in small doses
And cut it down when it’s ferocious

Oh, my misery is a mystery
She’s my mistress when she’s with me
And I miss her when she’s history
Oh, my misery is a mystery
