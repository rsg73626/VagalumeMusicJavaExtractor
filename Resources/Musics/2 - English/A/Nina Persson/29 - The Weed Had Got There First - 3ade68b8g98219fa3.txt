THE WEED HAD GOT THERE FIRST

For reasons that I don’t understand
I was out with a shuffle in my head
If someone's seen me let me know
I must have been looking for sand or snow

I had a garden on my mind
Ivy was growing around my spine
I lost a needle in the hay
I’m hoping I'll never need it anyway

I wanted to plant
A little seed
To fertilize the dirt
I didn’t see the sleeping weed
The weed had got there first
