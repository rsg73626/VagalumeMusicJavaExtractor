MY AMERICA

Darling, darling
The moon went out tonight
And I'm caught like a doe in your headlights
Oh yeah, alright
I'm yours to knock around
I'm a little too star-struck to wanna fight

It's a cold-hearted world
I'm gonna be your girl
It's a little too late to cry
To my America

Not quite Snow White
It came down all night
And put a filter of ash on the sunrise
Oh, yeah, alright
Move a little bit closer
Lay your victory hands on my innocence

It's a cold-hearted world
I'm gonna be your girl
It's just a little too late to cry
In my America

Oh, heaven laughs at us now, baby
We'll be shooting it down, daddy
It's a little too late to hope and pray for a miracle
To my America

Hey rockstar
You're my America
Hey rockstar
You're my America

You're my America
