BEAR ON THE BEACH

Iris in the morning rain sitting in a sea
It’s hard to tell the blues apart
She's salty just like me

She thinks she’s on a island
Though she wishes that she were
She thinks she hear the sirens
But I think is only
Iris in the morning rain sitting in a sea

She didn’t wanna see the fruit was out of reach
She’s caught between the ocean and the bear upon the beach
Imaginary waves could never drown you
And I didn’t want to tell her
I didn’t wanna tell her

Iris on a ladder climbing closer to the sky (Iris)
Rising from the ground she is a quitter just like I (I rise)
Sitting on a rooftop watching molecules collide
Safe above it all, she’s drinking mercury on ice
Iris on a ladder climbing closer to the sky (Iris)

She didn’t wanna see the stars were out of reach
She’s caught between the ocean and the bear upon the beach
Imaginary gulls could never save you
And I didn’t wanna tell her
I didn’t wanna tell her

She didn’t wanna see the stars were out of reach
She’s caught between the ocean and the bear upon the beach
Imaginary gulls could never save you
But I didn’t want to tell her
I didn’t wanna tell her
Didn’t wanna tell her
I didn’t wanna tell her
