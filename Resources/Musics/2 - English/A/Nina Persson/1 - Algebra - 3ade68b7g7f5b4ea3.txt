ALGEBRA

Why can't you just forget about algebra
It's all about you now
And all your talk of logic and formula
Could never help you now
Not anymore

'Cause you were always
On the run
From the darkness
In your heart
So you wear it
On the outside
Of your chest

I have taken the liberty
To tell your ghosts to go
Brighten with sunlight and simpathy
They promise not to show
For a while

'Cause you were always
The little boy
Who couldn't keep it
To yourself
So your heart
Is on the outside
Of your chest

At the speed of love
You moved inside my home
And nothing is alright
If you are still alone
And your heart
Is waiting that
The sound of you and everyone
Is still you're always on the wrong
From the poison in your love
And your heart
Is on the outside
Of your chest
