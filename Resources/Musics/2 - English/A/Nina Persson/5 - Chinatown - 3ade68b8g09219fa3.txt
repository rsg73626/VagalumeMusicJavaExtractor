CHINATOWN

Every town has a secret heart
That beats every citizen an underground
I set my clock to the bootleg near end
Broken hands spin around and round

I'm on my way just like every day
To get milk and kerosene
But my reflection in the butcher's window isn't me
I freeze.

This is Chinatown
A state of mind
This is Chinatown
Is just a state of mind

The sky was blue but I wouldn't know
I was counting cracks in the concrete
I'm memorized them from A to B
A choreography in part of me

Is not the future, is not the past, is not now
The price will double if you try to look them in the eye
Don't ask why

Cause this is Chinatown
A state of mind
This is Chinatown
A state of mind

In Chinatown...

Read my furtune in the metro card
You'll see nothing if you search hard
Read my furtune in the metro card
You'll see nothing if you search hard
