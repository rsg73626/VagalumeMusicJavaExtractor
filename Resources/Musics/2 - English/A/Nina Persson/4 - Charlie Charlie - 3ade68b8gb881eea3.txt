CHARLIE CHARLIE

I met a boy called Charlie Charlie 
On the 4th of September last year 
He was 21 and once a teenage star 
So sweet in the way he appeared 
In the way he appeared 

Charlie Charlie 
He was a trip into 
The wild and the free 
Got high on drinks and me 
In rock'n roll dreams 
We share the days and nights 
Till one morning 
He showed me 

I fell in love with Charlie Charlie 
It felt like the right thing to do 
With his careless charms
And his jaded eyes 
I know you would have fallen, too 
You would have fallen, too 

Charlie Charlie 
He was a trip into 
The wild and the free 
Got high on drinks and me 
In rock'n roll dreams 
We share the days and nights 
Till one morning 
He showed me 

Charlie Charlie 
When for an arend
At the end of the street 
He stole my heart 
But if you happen to meet him 
Tell him I don't want 
The money that he owes me 
I just wanna know 
What went through him 

Cause I could never know 
Even thou I thought I knew him 
Charlie Charlie 
What are you doing to me 

Charlie Charlie 
He's got my credit card 
And has something seen 
He stole my heart 
But if you happen to meet him
Tell him I don't want the money
I just want him
