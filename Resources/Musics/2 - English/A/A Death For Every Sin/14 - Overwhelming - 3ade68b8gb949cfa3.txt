OVERWHELMING

now we are here
we are closer to absolute control
more than ever before
my growing desire
to conquer the world
increases over night
this surge of poetic tyranny
gushes through my body conduits
feelings meet me face to face
i stand up taller than you
and watch my hands smother this world
i want to leave millions hypnotized
and gasping for their last breath
i have been here once before by myself
this is nothing new for me
i am degraded and thrown aside
realization steps away from its waltz
with my mental shadows
to present this uncoated truth
