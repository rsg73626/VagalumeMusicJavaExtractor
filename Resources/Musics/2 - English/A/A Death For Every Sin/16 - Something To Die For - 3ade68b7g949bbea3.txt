SOMETHING TO DIE FOR

No one makes it alone in this world of shit,
so build a place to exist and call it home.
To the few by my side, you are my everything.
For the few by my side, I’d give anything.
My friends and my family.
They make me who I am,
this is the one thing in my life that is truly precious.
This is my one true love, my reason to live.
I’ll always hold dear what is in my hands.
Words fail to express what is really sacred.
This is the only honor left for me to defend.
This is my one true love, this is what I’d die for.
