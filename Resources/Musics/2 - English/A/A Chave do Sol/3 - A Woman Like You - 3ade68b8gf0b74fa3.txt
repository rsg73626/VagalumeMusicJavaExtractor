A WOMAN LIKE YOU

When somebody searches for a heart
For a woman like you
Oh-Oh-oh
I was carrying on
I´ve been looking for another heart
For somebody like you
Oh-Oh-oh
I was going down

Before my heart begins to bleed
Oh, baby, you know what I need
But I´m just waiting for you

This is love
Girl, I´ve found you
Oh,let me tell the reason why

When somebody finds another heart
A pretty woman like you
Oh-Oh-oh
I´m carrying on

When one man finds another girl
Who burns like you
Oh-Oh-oh
I´m burning in love

When the flame shines into your heart
Then you´ll know where to find the star
And I´m just waiting for you
