DREAM AWAY

So you are
Through the night
And I lost myself in your eyes

On the beach
Held your hands
As we dug our feet into the sand

If I could have you in my life at all
That would be enough
Now I don't know what it's like to be alone
Without your love

Dream away
Dream away

Moving on our way, just a dream away
Moving on our way, just a dream away

So we ran from the water
Up the ramp to the life gaurd tower

And we sat
And I told you, your heart is what a treasure
And this could last forever

If I could have you in my life at all
That would be enough
Now I don't know what it's like to be alone
Without your love

Dream away
So love can last through all our days
Dream away
And hold on so this feeling stays
Dream away
In sleep my heart still sings your name
Dream away
With love like this our lives won't be the same

I lost myself
You lost yourself
We're on our way, just a dream away
Cause we lost ourselves
We lost ourselves
We lost ourselves
We lost ourselves

Dream away
So love can last through all our days
Dream away
And hold on so this feeling stays
Dream away
In sleep my heart still sings your name
Dream away
With love like this our lives won't be the same

We're on our way, just a dream away
We're on our way, just a dream away
We're on our way, just a dream away.
