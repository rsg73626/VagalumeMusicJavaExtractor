SOONER OR LATER

When you lose the faith, 
I am without control 
And I feel bad, without hope 
And around me, 
The envy is, doing 
people hate most. 

I feel alone, (I am only) 
But I know that I am not (I know that I am not) 
Because I take you in thought 
My fear is gone, (my fear is gone) 
Recupero the faith, (Recupero the faith, 
And I feel that someday 
I still see you 
Sooner or later (sooner or later) 

(Refrain) 

Sooner or later 
We will find, 
I'm sure, a lot better. 
I know that when you can hear me sing. 

You make me want to live, 
And what is ours, 
You are saved 
in me and you 
And just that simply 


I feel alone, (I am only) 
But I know that I am not (I know that I am not) 
Because I take you in thought 
My fear is gone, (my fear is gone) 
Recupero the faith, (Recupero the faith, 
And I feel that someday I'm going to see you 
Sooner or later (sooner or later) 

(Refrain) 
Sooner or later 
We will find, 
I'm sure, a lot better. 
I know that when you can hear me sing. 

Uhuhul 2x 

(Refrain) 
Sooner or later 
We will find, 
I'm sure, a lot better. 
I know that when you can hear me sing.
