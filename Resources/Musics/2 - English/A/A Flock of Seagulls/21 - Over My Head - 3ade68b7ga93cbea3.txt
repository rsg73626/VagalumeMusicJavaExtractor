OVER MY HEAD

I was walking underwater
Walking on the bottom of the sea
A sudden change in the weather
And the waves came crashing down
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
All over my head
I think I'm in

I was searching for a treasure
Walking on the surface of the Moon
A sudden change in the pressure
Left me gasping
For the precious air that's over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in

Saw my reflection in the mirror
Saw my image standing by a wall
I tried to touch the glass
But it shattered and it began to fall
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in

Another starving baby's cry
A dying heart that's still made bold
Another coke another lie
A naked man I stand alone
Searching for the easy answer
Searching for a love that has no pain
Under the circumstances
The walls of love caved in again
All over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in

Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
Over my head
I think I'm in
