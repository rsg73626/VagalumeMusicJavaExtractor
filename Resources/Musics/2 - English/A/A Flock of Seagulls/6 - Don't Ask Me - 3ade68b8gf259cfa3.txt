DON'T ASK ME

What happened to the world we had when we were young?
What happened to the sun?
What happened to the buildings and the fields and trees?
Won't someone tell me, please?

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

What happened to the wings that used to search the sky?
Where did the clouds all fly?
No sign of life around me, nothing anywhere.
This moment I should share.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

But I'm so glad I waited,
As I anticipated,
'cos now I see you.

I see your points of silver piercing the night,
Moving towards my sight.
I'll never understand the lights up in the sky
No matter how I try.

I sit here all alone and watch the saucers in the sky.
Where has the feeling gone?
Don't ask me why, don't ask me.

But I'm so glad I waited,
As I anticipated,
'cos now I see you.

But I'm so glad I waited, (waited)
As I anticipated,
'cos now I see you.

Yes I'm so glad I waited, (waited)
As I anticipated,
'cos now I see you.
