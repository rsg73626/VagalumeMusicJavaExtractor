BETTER & BETTER

It's getting harder to believe the news
To believe in what the papers may say
Well, baby, I've got news for you
Because the earth gets better each day

That I love you, that I love you
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you
And our love is getting better
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you
And our love is getting better

I know it's hard for you to understand
(When they're telling, telling, telling you lies)
When all they want to do is take up your hand
I know it's hard for you to realize
(When they're telling, telling, telling me lies)
You just better believe me when you smile

That I love you, that I love you
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you
And our love is getting better
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you
And our love is getting better

I know it's hard for you to understand
(When they're telling, telling, telling me lies)
When all they want to do is take up your hand
When all I really ever wanted to say...is

That I love you, that I love you
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you
And our love is getting better
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you, that I love you
That I love you
And our love is getting better

Oh, doctor, help...our love is getting better
Oh, doctor...better and better, wo ho
Oh, doctor...you know this love is getting better for me
Getting much better, better, better
