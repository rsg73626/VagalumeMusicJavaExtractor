I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE

I can't look at what we`ve done and make it all ok
All hope is found in you
We know it's found in you

I cant's look at what we've done and make it all ok
All hope is found in you
We know it's found in you

Take us and let us see
All we need is to see

Let us carry on through the night
Let us carry on through the night

Take us and let us see
All we need is to see
Take us and let us see
All we need is to see

It's like they poisoned us overnight
How much they can take?
We all need to take charge
(we can wake them)
It's like they poisoned us overnight
How much they can take?
We all need to take charge
(we can wake them)

Speak now and save this world
When silence is deafening 

When silence is deafening
The world is set aflame
God is real
And we stand strong
Speak now and save this world

So write this down, as it comes
As a reminder
For when you're lost
This shall come to mind

All was offered
All was offered
Oh!

We are not of this world
We are of God.

We've become so
Lost in how we think it is supposed to be
Let us become one voice
Because we were made to sing

We look to you Father
We look to you Father
We look to you Father
We look to you Father

The day has actually come
Where they will tell us lies
These words are not in the book

Don't tell us what you think
Dont's preach for us in vain
Tell us about the truth

I've come to destroy the wisdom
I've come to destroy the wise

I've come to destroy the wisdom (of the wise)
I've come to destroy the wisdom (of the wise)
I've come to destroy the wisdom (of the wise)
I've come to destroy the wisdom (of the wise)
