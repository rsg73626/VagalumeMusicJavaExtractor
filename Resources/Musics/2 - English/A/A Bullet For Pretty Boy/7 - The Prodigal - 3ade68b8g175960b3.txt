THE PRODIGAL

Restless to the ignorance
The painting pictures of destroy
Traveled in their dreams of instinct
The city from the night is disgraced
Traverse these of humanity have gone astray
These to our innocence dies, embrace this kissing psalms

Our intentions conveyed with these curves
Innocence is the price of lights
Destiny in the light the consequence
Scarlet for the ceilings of the night
Rest in your flesh of the sky
Strength your glass to everything

These fire ignite, suffocating the sky
Second chances from the city beliefs
The restoring beauty for the ground
This is the life of tragedy
Destined for the regrets
Traverse these of humanity have gone astray

These to our innocence dies, embrace this kissing psalms
Our intentions conveyed with these curves
Innocence is the price of lights
Destiny in the light the consequence
Scarlet for the ceilings of the night
We strive to open up my fiction tragedy
Their simple minds are even starting to realize
That their dreams are in reach

Traverse these of humanity have gone astray
These to our innocence dies, embrace this kissing psalms
Our intentions conveyed with these curves
Innocence is the price of lights
Destiny in the light the consequence
Scarlet for the ceilings of the night
Traverse these of humanity have gone astray

These to our innocence dies, embrace this kissing psalms
Our intentions conveyed with these curves
Innocence is the price of lights
Destiny in the light the consequence
Scarlet for the ceilings of the night
Traverse these of humanity have gone astray

These to our innocence dies, embrace this kissing psalms
Our intentions conveyed with these curves
Innocence is the price of lights
Destiny in the light the consequence
Scarlet for the ceilings of the night
Terror of take my grave passion
