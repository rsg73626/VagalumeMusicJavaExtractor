SILENT WAR

Stiffling,
This day is stiffling.
You're sprawled out like a king
On the sheets of my queen sized bed

And I'm
Too hot to lie beside,
Possessed of idle mind
This calm is a false friend.

Jealousy,
I suspect jealousy.
Something is changing me
Real slow from the inside out.

It seems,
You mean too much to me,
Too much for comfort, see,
The cause is the cure now.

We fought a silent war in a hardware store
And the air was thick as pain
Though I carried it on I knew that I was wrong
But I fight when I'm afraid
I come with guns a-blazing.

Someone once,
I forget who it was,
Said, do not think so much
You can't hear what your heart says.

My heart speaks
In tugs and puddle-leaps
And bangs my ribs to pieces.
Thoughts are the safe bet.

We fought a silent war in a hardware store
And the air was thick as pain
Though I carried it on I knew that I was wrong
But I fight when I'm afraid
My guns will come a-blazing,
A lesser man would be afraid.

And how you razed me to the ground
And how you wore me down
With the sound of the shaming as you went out.

The cause is the cure now

We fought a silent war in a hardware store
And the air was thick as pain
Though I carried it on I knew that I was wrong
But I fight when I'm afraid
With guns I come a-blazing,
A lesser man would break free
And sorry was all I meant to say.
