LIFESIZE

We stood so tall we caught a plane
by the wing and held it safe
Until we found it a place to land
We layed across the ocean wide
Bridged the gap in record time
The people traveled across and kissed our hands

All for love we become

Larger than lifesize, wondersome
Great in the eyes of someone
Larger than lifesize we become
Great in the eyes of someone

We smiled so bright the sun went down
Rose above the maddening crowd
We lit the streets with the sweetest glow
We held the globe and made it turn
Wandered through the universe
The men of science observed through telescopes

All for love, we become

Larger than lifesize, wondersome
Great in the eyes of someone
Larger than lifesize we become,
Great in the eyes of someone

Larger than lifesize we become
Larger than lifesize we become
Great in the eyes of someone
