THE WORLD WITHOUT

It must be written that the moon elbowed the stars and said:
“let's do our best to make it hard for them”
Your house turned into paper cranes
We watched the wind blow them away
Some sorry comfort I was then


The weight of a mountain
The skin off your knees
From climbing back to me


We can work this out
I believe, although it seems impossible


They turned our skeletons to wood,
And scattered matches underfoot
We must walk carefully in place
The circles darken round our eyes
And yet our bodies, when combined
They gleam like diamonds in cave


We can work this out
I believe, although it seems impossible now
Keep the world without
Only the two of us count
Two voices loud
It is possible now
Though they wore us down
We'll find our way again


Heloise gave her whole heart to Pete
now eternally sleeps by his side
Oh, go ahead, fate, oh, give us your best
What is worth living for is worth a fight
Into the night
