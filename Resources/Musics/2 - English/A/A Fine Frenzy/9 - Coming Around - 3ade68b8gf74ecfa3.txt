COMING AROUND

Leathers, she said leathers
Cutting new cloth,
From our grandparents' patterns
We have big dreams
And big dream takers
They come in at the sun
Just to see what would happen

We're coming, we're coming around

Faster,
Moving faster
Pushing harder,
Falling forwards n backwards
Of all these converts
Engage our patterns
Folding empires
Fighting golddiggers' down

We're coming, we're coming around
We're coming, we're coming around
Yeah, we're coming, we're coming around
It's coming, it's coming around
It's coming, it's coming around

We seem to even be missing the start
No one else but you n me have a say
And we're coming, we're coming around
It's coming, it's coming around

We're coming.. We're coming around
It's coming.. It's coming around
