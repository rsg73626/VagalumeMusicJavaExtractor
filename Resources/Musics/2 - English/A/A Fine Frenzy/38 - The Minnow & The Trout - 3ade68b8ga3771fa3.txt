THE MINNOW & THE TROUT

Help me out said the minnow to the trout
I was lost and found myself swimming in your mouth
Help me chief
I've got to plans for you and me
I swear upon this riverbed
I'll help you feel young again

Not your every day circumstance
Hummingbird taking coffee with the ants

Please, I know that we're different
We were one cell in the sea in the beginning
And what we're made of was all the same once
We're not that different after all

Help me out said the eagle to the dove
I've fallen from my nest so high above
Help me fly
I am too afraid to try
Now saddled with a fear of heights
I'm praying you can set me right

Not your everyday circumstance
Elephant sharing peanuts with the rats
And I said

Please, I know that we're different
We were one cell in the sea in the beginning
And what we're made of was all the same once
We're not that different after all

We are tied in history
Connected like a family

We are tied in history
Connected like a family

Please, I know that we're different
We were one cell in the sea in the beginning
And what we're made of was all the same once
All the same
We're not that different after all
