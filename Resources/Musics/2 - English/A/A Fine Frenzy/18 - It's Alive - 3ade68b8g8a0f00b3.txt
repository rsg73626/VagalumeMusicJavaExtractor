IT'S ALIVE

Never say never say never
Say the sunken ship
For you never know where you?re going to go
When the anchor lifts, oh, lifts
Pry my fingers off
Loosen the deathly grip
You can?t be tethered to a ghost
To a memory
You?ve got to swim

He cast me adrift
Said, don?t forget
And cast me adrift
He said

There is something about you
Whole, it?s something about you
Vivid, something about you
?Bout you, ?bout you lives, it?s alive

Ooh it?s alive
Baby ooh, it?s alive

I don?t know anything
Any much of anything about this here
It is uncharted territory
I know it?s the new frontier, it?s clear
I want you near
But you?re not there to run to
Even when you appear

Yet, there is something about you
Whole, it?s something about you
Vivid, something about you
?Bout you, ?bout you lives, it?s alive
To know somebody like you
Exists makes it all right to
Forget what I left behind
Because I like you like you like
It?s alive

Ooh it?s alive
Baby ooh, it?s alive
