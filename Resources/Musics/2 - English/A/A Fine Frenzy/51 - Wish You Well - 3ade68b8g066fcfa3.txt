WISH YOU WELL

You're a million miles away this Christmas
You're a million miles away from home
But if you feel like coming back, coming back, let me know

I haven't heard you call me sister
I haven't heard it said in years
But it's a funny thing now it's the only thing I want to hear
For I don't know you anymore

I said ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
Ring a sleigh bell
Ring a doorbell
I want to wish you well

Our family was never perfect
You did your best to tear it down
Well everybody made mistakes
I wish we could fix'em now

I understand that you are angry
Well, maybe I am angry too
Cause I still love you brother
But I don't know what to make of you
When I don't know you anymore

I said ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
Ring a sleigh bell
Ring a doorbell
I want to wish you well

I said ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
Ring a sleigh bell
Ring a doorbell
I want to wish you well

Now do you sit by your plastic tree
And tell your friends you've no family
It's not over, over, over
It's not over, over, over

I said ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
Ring a sleigh bell
Ring a doorbell
I want to wish you well

I said ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
Ring a sleigh bell
Ring a doorbell
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
