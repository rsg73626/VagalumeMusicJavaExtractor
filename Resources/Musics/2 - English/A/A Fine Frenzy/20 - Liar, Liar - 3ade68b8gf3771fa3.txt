LIAR, LIAR

Liar liar
You're such a great big liar
With the tallest tales that I have ever heard
Fire fire
You set my soul on fire
Laughing in the corner as it burns
Right between the ribs is sinking in

Oh, the sirens sang so sweet and watch the sailors going down
Oh, you don't do me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown
Anyone would drown

Sick and tired of this mad desire
Fluttering aside me like a hawk
Wire wire
Got my hands on wires
Will heaven help you when I get them out?

Right between the ribs
You'll feel it then

The sirens sang so sweet and watch the sailors going down
Oh, you don't do me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown
Anyone would drown

All the ships go down
Following the sound
All the ships go down

Oh oh the siren sang so sweet and watch the sailors going down
Oh oh you don't do me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown
