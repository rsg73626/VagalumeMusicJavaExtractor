LOST THINGS (SLEEPWALKING)

Houses to houses,
Sinks with rolls and floors,
Windows to hallways,
Closed and open doors.

Softly,
They creep softly.
Plus, we
Have now lost thee.

Cover your eyes with the paper clothes
That you stole from paper sheep.
Tracing their jumps on the paper sky
Where the fallen the paper sleep.

Fallin',
We're always fallin'.
Callin',
"Hey come back, lost things!"

Ahhh, oh my God!
Ahhh, oh my God!

Summer was once where
the widest winter breathes.
I know it's somewhere,
and right behind our teeth.

Come and,
Come and called it.
Caught it
And then we lost it.
