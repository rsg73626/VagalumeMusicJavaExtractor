OH, BLUE CHRISTMAS

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue, blue memories, they start a-calling
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll, I'll have a blue, blue blue Christmas

Blue, blue Christmas without you
Blue, blue
Blue, blue
Blue, blue

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
