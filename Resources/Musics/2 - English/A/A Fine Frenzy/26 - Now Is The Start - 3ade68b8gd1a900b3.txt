NOW IS THE START

Hey! Do you hear, do you hear, that sound?
It's the sound of the lost gone found 
It's the sound of a mute gone loud 
It's the sound of a new start 

Kiss 
With a mouth of shooting stars 
Of lost and broken hearts 
Unafraid you can name your scars 
With a touch of a new heart 

And it sounds like 
It sounds like 
It sounds like 

La-dee-dadadadada, dadadadada
Now, oh, now is the start 

Oh 
And it goes with where you go 
Don't lose faith for the friends 
You don't 
Need a thing, you already know 
You are right as you are 

And it sounds like 
It sounds like 
Oh, it sounds like 

La-dee-dadadadada, dadadadada 
Now, now 
La-dee-dadadadada, dadadadada 
Now, oh 
Now is the start, oh 
Now is the start 

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey 

New start in the end 
There is a 
New heart under there 
Beneath these 
New parts everywhere 
It is a new, new, new, new start 
Now is the start 

It sounds like 
Oh, it sounds like 
Oh, it sounds like 

La-dee-dadadadada, dadadadada 
Now, now 
La-dee-dadadadada, dadadadada 
Now, oh, now is the start 
Oh, now is the start 
Now is the start
