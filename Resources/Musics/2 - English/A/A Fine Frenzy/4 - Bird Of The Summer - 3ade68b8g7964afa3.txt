BIRD OF THE SUMMER

You came with the season, 
as the first swallow sang
A brown headed stranger, 
with a five-letter name
dododododododo
we planted our kisses 
where the wild berries grow 
my feet sprouted wings and i flew all the way home 
dododododododo

My cheeks red like fire engines racing
Straight to the heat of your skin
I know our days are numbered, early bird of the summer
you'll fly south just as the fall begins.

The leaves changed their colors and the schoolyards were filled
My coat with the patches barely keeps out the chill
dodododododo
You sent me a postcard from a town out of state
I wish it were warmer and i hope you're the same
dododododododo

The fields where we wandered were golden
Now only muddy my boots
I know I should recover, you're a bird of the summer,
I was wrong to try and capture you.

Flight
Flight

I miss someone walk in a park by the lake
Don't fly like weather but it don't fly away
dodododododo

Gone is the pale hand of winter
Here is the first flush of may
and soon I will discover whether birds of the summer
fly in circles or just fly away
