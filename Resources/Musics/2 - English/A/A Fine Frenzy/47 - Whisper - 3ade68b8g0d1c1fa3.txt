WHISPER

running the race
like a mouse in a cage
getting nowhere, but I'm trying
forging ahead
but I'm stuck in the bed
that I made,
so I'm lying

but if you keep real close
yeah, you stay real close
I will reach you.
I'm down to a whisper
in a daydream on a hill
shut down to a whisper
can you hear me still
eager to please,
trying to be what they need
but I'm so very tired
I've stopped trying to find
any peace in my mind
'cause it tangles the wires

but if you keep real close
yeah, you stay real close
I will reach you.

I'm down to a whisper
in a daydream on a hill
shut down to a whisper
can you hear me
can you hear me
still the sound,
it dies on my lips
to fade away
and to forget

I'm down to a whisper
in a daydream on a hill
shut down to a whisper
can you hear me, can you hear me (repeats) still
