U-TURN

Don’t let yourself get hurt this time
Who is to keep who’s to decline?
Making amends is not my style don’t get me started, she says

No use repeating same old lines
No use backtracking good old times
The ones you want are not always the ones that make you happy

And thus she steps into the night
Her pocket stuffed with nose delight
Nine lifes for clubbin’ wonder wich fits the best

U-turn, 180
U-turn, facing the failure
U-turn, on parole
Flip chart lovin’
She knows the goal

U-turn, 180
U-turn, facing the failure
U-turn, back for more
Flip chart lovin’
She knows the score

Disconnect the brains
Vanity obeys
Jumpin’ to forget
Nighttime bouncing in the discotheque

Feel the beat, hit the floor
Time to settle the score
‘Cause forever and more
She’ll be closin’ the door

Got a mind of her own
Got a mind of her own
Got a mind of her own

U-turn, 180
U-turn, facing the failure
U-turn, on parole
Flip chart lovin’
She knows the goal

She knows the score

A perfect habitat for foxes

We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
I can’t explain I can’t explain
We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
We broke down in a plane
We broke down in a plane
We broke down in a plane
We broke down in a plane
I can’t explain I can’t explain
We broke up in a dream
Lay down time, lay down your love
Lay yourself down for a while
Lay down time, rest your mind
A perfect habitat for foxes
We made up in a haze
We made up in a haze
We made up in a haze
A perfect habitat for foxes
The world a house a place to live in, in the place a man forgiven
In the house a girl, a kitten, a tear resolved, the sky lit up, rejoice rejoice
The curtain’s lifted, pleasure, pleasure out of the ordinary
A rock, a house, a hill to live upon, the sky, a well, the grass to depend upon
I can’t explain we still live in a dream
I can’t explain we still live in a dream
I can’t explain we still live in a dream
I can’t explain we still live in a dream
A perfect habitat for foxes
