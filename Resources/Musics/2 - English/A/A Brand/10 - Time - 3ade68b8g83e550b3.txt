TIME

Time, you do lead us astray
Leading us almost everyday
Are you a friend?
Are you my keeper?
Are you a relic?
Are you a cheater?
Can I deny you?
Can I believe you?
Can I deceive you?
You're a deceiver
You're a deceiver

Time, when you rush in
From day one
'till the time that we're done
We just run
Trying to catch you
With the present
Without a chance
Of any progress
Any movements
Any improvements
Despite the effort
You're late
You're late
You're late
You're late

Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time
1, 2, ..., 30
The speed of light
The speed of sound
Without any doubt
Beats mankind
You're going faster
You think you do
You think you will
Well you won't
Well you don't
You're so slow
You're so slow
You're so goddamn slow
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun

Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
Time, goddamn no-good son of a gun
