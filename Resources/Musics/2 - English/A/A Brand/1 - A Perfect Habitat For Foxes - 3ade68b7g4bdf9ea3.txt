A PERFECT HABITAT FOR FOXES

We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
I can’t explain I can’t explain
We broke up in a dream
We broke up in a dream
We broke down in a plane
We broke down in a plane
We broke down in a plane
We broke down in a plane
I can’t explain I can’t explain
We broke up in a dream
Lay down time, lay down your love
Lay yourself down for a while
Lay down time, rest your mind
A perfect habitat for foxes
We made up in a haze
We made up in a haze
We made up in a haze
A perfect habitat for foxes
The world a house a place to live in, in the place a man forgiven
In the house a girl, a kitten, a tear resolved, the sky lit up, rejoice rejoice
The curtain’s lifted, pleasure, pleasure out of the ordinary
A rock, a house, a hill to live upon, the sky, a well, the grass to depend upon
I can’t explain we still live in a dream x4
A perfect habitat for foxes
