WONDERS OF LEWIS

Wonders of Lewis
 blowing my mind
Stoning me blind
 in the mid-summertime
Mist in the hollows
 and clothes on the line
Blowing my...
 blowing my...

Wonders of Lewis 
 blowing my mind
Five after midnight
 and the sun still shines
Standing stones 
 all in a line
Blowing my...
 blowing my...
Mind!
