A BOY IN BLACK LEATHER

Jackie was one of the crowd
who hung out at the Cross Keys Hotel
She was a real bright kid,
thought I knew her pretty well
Beach parties at night
we ran down town in the day
till a boy in black leather
came and took Jackie away

We were all in The Keys one night
sitting, laughing and joking
Billy'd got himself a new job
Ros had given up smoking
I was crazy for Jackie
I was almost ready to say
when a boy in black leather
came and took Jackie away

He was standing at the bar
when I went up for a drink
Then he and she just started talking
I didn't know what to think
Billy pulled me into an argument
about the big bad world today
I looked up and a boy in black leather
was taking Jackie away

After that things began to get dull
I took up with Billy's sister Molly
but that got really kicked on the head
when she upped and went to college
I got to thinking about Jackie
and as Autumn moved into grey
I thought about a boy in black leather
who came and took Jackie away

Then this month I saw her
The girl I knew had all but gone
Tight jeans, mohair sweater
Her hair was chopped off peroxide blonde
I crossed the road towards her
thinking of something to say
when a boy in black leather walked over
and together they hurried away
