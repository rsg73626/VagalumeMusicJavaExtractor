SINCE I FOUND MY SCHOOL

I'm alone, I'm in bits
got no home, got no hits
but it's cool
since I found my School

Got some style, hit my stride
got me a smile about a whole world wide
Feeling cool
since I found my School

Child Of The Wind
Mr Vulnerable
Dark Music
Open-Heart House
Tree Of Stars

I'm alive, I'm intact
I survived, it's a fact
life is cool
since I found my School

Three Sevens
Mr Rock And Roll
Secrets
The Thing I Lost
Tree Of Stars

I'm alive, I'm intact
I survived, it's a fact
life is cool
since I found my School
