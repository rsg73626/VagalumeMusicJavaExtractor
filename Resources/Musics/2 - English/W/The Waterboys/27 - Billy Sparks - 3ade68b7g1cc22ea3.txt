BILLY SPARKS

What shall I give you to make you take down your dress
 what shall I give you to make you take down your dress
Will you show me where the party is
 And we'll put you to some quiet caravan
And as sure as my name's Billy Sparks I'm your man
Singing doodoo doo doodoo
 doodoo doo doodoo
Doodoo doo doodoo
 doodoo doo doodoo

Where will I find you when siesta comes
 tell me where will I find you when siesta comes
Hasta manana by the sycamore tree
 well you just sat someplace else looking for me
And when I find you singing doodoo doo doodoo
 dodoo doo doodoo
Doodoo doo doodoo
 doodoo doo doodoo
Doodoo doo doodoo

And we're gonna dance Electric Fantastic
 we're gonna dance Electric Fantastic
Yeah, go on and tell everybody that you know
 brush your hair up in a big red bow
And all we need
 is a bottle and a broomstick, yeah!
Singing doodoo doo doodoo
 doodoo doo doodoo
Singing doodoo doo doodoo
 singing doodoo doo doodoo

Hey!
