HIS WORD IS NOT HIS BOND

(Girls let me tell you what a liar will do
He's always coming with something new
He'll steal your heart...)

He lives in the waste
 void of culture and taste
His eye on a prize beyond
 his every word is in the right place
But his word is not his bond

His face is comely
 his heart it bleeds
Yet it's but a mantel
 he has donned
Mark him only by his deeds
 for his word is not his bond

I'd love to take him
 out of this room
And gently break him
 I'd love to see him dance!

His protogee deals
 in confusion and fog
Of power he is fond
 wheels within wheels
Like master, like dog
 his word is not his bond

I'm trying to swim
 but I'm caught in the shallows
And I sense that I've been conned
 deliver him
To the gallows
 his word is not his bond

His word is not his bond!
