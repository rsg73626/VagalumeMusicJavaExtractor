THIS IS THE SEA

These things you keep
 you'd better throw them away
You wanna turn your back
 on your soulless days
Once you were tethered
 and now you are free
Once you were tethered
 well now you are free
That was the river
 this is the sea!

Now if you're feelin' weary
 if you've been alone too long
Maybe you've been suffering from
 a few too many
Plans that have gone wrong
 and you're trying to remember
How fine your life used to be
 running around banging your drum
Like it's 1973
 well that was the river
This is the sea!
 wooo!

Now you say you've got trouble
 you say you've got pain
You say've got nothing left to believe in
 nothing to hold on to
Nothing to trust
 nothing but chains
You're scouring your conscience
 raking through your memories
Scouring your conscience
 raking through your memories
But that was the river
 this is the sea yeah!

Now I can see you wavering
 as you try to decide
You've got a war in your head
 and it's tearing you up inside
You're trying to make sense
 of something that you just can't see
Trying to make sense now
 and you know you once held the key
But that was the river
 and this is the sea!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

Now I hear there's a train
 it's coming on down the line
It's yours if you hurry
 you've got still enough time
And you don't need no ticket
 and you don't pay no fee
No you don't need no ticket
 you don't pay no fee
Because that was the river
 and this is the sea!

Behold the sea!
