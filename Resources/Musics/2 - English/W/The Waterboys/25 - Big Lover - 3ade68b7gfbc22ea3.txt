BIG LOVER

Big lover
 when I feel your love flow through me
Big lover
 when I hear you whisper to me
Big lover
 when I feel you

You were like every love I've known
 spun into one - my mind is blown
You were like all my burnt down dreams redeemed
 you know what I mean

Big lover
 when I feel your love flow through
Big lover
 when I hear your heart speak truly
Big lover!

You were a mystery revealed
 a treasure trove too long concealed
You were like all my torn down dreams redeemed
 you know what I mean

Big lover
 when I feel your love
Big lover
 when I feel your love
Big lover
 when I feel your love flow through me
Big lover
 when I hear you whisper to me
Big lover!

You were like earth and fire to me
 you were J-O-Y M-A-G-I-C
You were like all my ripped down dreams redeemed
 you know what I mean

Big lover
 when I feel your love
Big lover
 when I feel your love
Big lover
 when I feel your love

I'm alive!
 yes, I'm alive!
I'm truly alive
 alive!
