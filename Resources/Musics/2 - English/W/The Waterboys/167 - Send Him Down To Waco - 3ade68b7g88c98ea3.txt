SEND HIM DOWN TO WACO

The President's feelin' real upset
he hasn't passed his budget yet
he hasn't even broken sweat
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

His promises are wearing thin
and his golden glow looks more like tin
but he's still smirking cheek to chin
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

They say even great men have their flaws
but this one wouldn't know what greatness was
if it bit him up the Arkansas
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

When he got in I sure was glad
but I just seen through his smooth facade
He ain't Bush but he's pretty bad
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

He dropped the missiles on Iraq
to get his image back on track
He can't bring the dead civilians back
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

His wife who never received a vote
seems to be the one who really steers the boat
This isn't serious - this is a joke
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

When the Mississippi took a twist
he got out there with his publicist
but there's one photo-op he missed
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco

Who knows what the future holds
but whatever way this thing unfolds
for the good of his soul
send him down to Waco
send him down to Waco
Send him down to Waco
Send him down to Waco
Send him down to Waco
Send him down
Have him take a look around
Take the kids
see the sights....
History !
