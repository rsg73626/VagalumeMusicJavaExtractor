TWO GREAT WAVES

I'm caught between two great waves
breaking against my soul
Yeah I'm caught between two great waves
and I'm wondering which way to roll

My once proud and handsome ship
is listing like a wreck
Fear has laid his grip
like a traitor around my neck

I'm caught between two great waves
breaking against my soul
Yeah I'm caught between two great waves
and I'm wondering which way to roll

The killer in my mind
is giving me no peace
Angels get behind
I think I gotta face the beast !

The pressure's coming down
closing around me like a wall
I don't know why or how
but I can't move at all

I'm caught between two great waves
breaking against my soul
Yeah I'm caught between two great waves
and I'm wondering which way to roll

I'm almost like The Fool
teetering on the brink
but he's unconcerned and cool
I'm convinced I'm gonna sink

I'm caught !
Yeah I'm caught !
Caught between two great waves
breaking against my soul
And I'm wondering which way to roll...
which way to roll
which way to roll...
