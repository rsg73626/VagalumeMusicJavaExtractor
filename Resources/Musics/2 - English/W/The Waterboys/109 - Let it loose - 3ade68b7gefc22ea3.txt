LET IT LOOSE

Exploitation is alive on the streets
 I'll probably just stay in my room
Everything I ever believed in hangs
 limp like a burst balloon
Christmas is coming
 man is getting fat
Me - I'm getting sucked in -
 thought I was smarter than that

One side is dirty red
 one side is freezing blue
You stand in the middle
 'cos you've nothing better to do
Give you a choice
 even though I know
>You rarely think
 start making decisions
Start to sink

When you've grown up afraid
 with a built in fear
Of authoritive parents
 and your pre-planned career
And your neck is stretched
 in a very civilised noose
Give you a choice
 let it die or let is loose

Christmas is coming
 man is getting fat
Please put in a penny
 in society's hat

Christmas is coming
 man is getting fat
Please put in a penny
 in society's hat
