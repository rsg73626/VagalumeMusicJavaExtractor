DARK MAN OF MY DREAMS

The dark man of dreams
the figure without any face
is taunting me
is haunting me
from his hidden place

The dark man of my dreams
killer of the hoping heart
is choking me
has broken me
since we did part

And until my awakening
I never felt
a single thing
But as winter turns to spring
I sense his loss
in everything

The dark man of my dreams
sentry at the slit of my soul
If I dare to ask
will you let me pass
or eat me whole

Dark man of my dreams
this information you keep
will it frighten me ?
enlighten me ?
or make me weep

Perhaps you feel like stepping in
don't fool yourself
you ain't him !
It's my projection,mine alone
you've got no business here
Go home !

The dark man of my dreams
I'm told I'm a lot like you
and if that means
what I think it means
I must be in your dreams too
