HIGHER BOUND

Well, I'm easy to love
 but I'm harder to hold
Down through this earth
 my story is told
I'm a wheeling and a-winding down
 every road and every town
I'm tumbling through the years
 Higher bound!

I've as many eyes
 as ever were
And though I'm older
 than the world
I am the very youngest thing
 that ever did breath upon a pearl
I am a coat of many colours
 with the coronation stone and the crown
I'm tumbling through the years
 Higher bound!

I'm the song of the river
 speeding unceasing to the sea
I'm alive!
 I'm in love!
Each and every time
 there's some for me
My head is in the stars
 my feet are on the ground
I'm tumbling through the years
 Higher bound!

I filled the hall
 at Bru na Boine
I saw the rose
 of mystery
I've been a fish
 upon a coin
Complete
 I'll never be...
I'll meet you on the mountain
 when the mountain time comes around
I'm tumbling through the years
 Higher bound!
I'm dancing through the years
 Higher bound!
