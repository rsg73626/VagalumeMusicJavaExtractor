DUMBING DOWN THE WORLD

I'm dumbing down the world
 Yes, I'm dumbing down the world
And my head is held high
 And the glint in my eye
And my arrogance rumbles before me!

I'm dumbing down the world!
 I'm dumbing down the world!
I'm dumbing down, I'm dumbing down the world!
 I'm dumbing down the world!

And my thoughts are banal, like a stagnant canal
 and my sycophants shamble behind me

I'm dumbing down the world
 Yeah, I'm dumbing down the world
I'm dumbing down, I'm dumbing down the world
 Yeah, I'm dumbing down the world!

And my power is come around, is come around
 Yes! My hour is come around, is come around - look around!

I'm dumbing down the world
 Yes, I'm dumbing down the world

And my works are designed to suck blood from your mind
 for you energy feeds and sustains me!

I'm dumbing down the world!
 Yes, Iâ€™m dumbing down the world
I'm dumbing down the world (and I love it!)
 I'm dumbing down the world
