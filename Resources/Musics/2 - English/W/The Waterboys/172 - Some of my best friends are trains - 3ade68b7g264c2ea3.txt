SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE TRAINS

Flashman's in the belfry shouting as loud as he can
 Samson's up all night again talking about himself
What a wonderful man
 and I'm just wild about Ronnie
And Ronnie's just wild about me
 I saw him selling winter coats on the Portobello Road
I thought I bet he wishes he was really working for the NME

When the gang came down here again
 and they're phoning up Australia and they call each other names
And they all just wanna look like Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine
 some of my best friends are trains

Now Steven's in a sweat, he just can't read Kerouac books
 and Robin's all excuses, says he can't find much but he does look
He goes up to the playfair
 he goes down with the stars
He goes wild all the weekend in a girlfriend's car
 and he calls me from Chelsea and he says it's such a thrill
And though I don't believe a word but he keeps me talking

Til the gang come down here again
 and they're phoning up Australia and they call each other names
And they all just wanna look like Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine
 some of my best friends are trains

And did you ever have
 one of those days
Where the world's wide open
 and you can do anything
And you can go anywhere
 and you don't have to think
About who you'll offend
 every time that you even blink
I'm going to the station where a big red train
 is waiting to take me to the country again
Then you'll come from Yonkers but why should I care
 it'll rain and rain for days and days and you know I won't be there

When the gang come down here again
 and they're phoning up Australia and they call each other names
And they all just wanna look like Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine
 some of my best friends

Yeah the gang come down here again
 and they're calling up Australia and they're scaring all my friends
And they all just wanna look like Hell and Verlaine
 some of my best friends are trains
