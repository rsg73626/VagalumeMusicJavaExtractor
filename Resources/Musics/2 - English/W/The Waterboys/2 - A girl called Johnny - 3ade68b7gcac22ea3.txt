A GIRL CALLED JOHNNY

I remember Johnny - hey!
 Johnny come lately
I remember her shoes like a ballerina
A girl called Johnny who
 changed her name when she
 discovered her choice was to
 change or to be changed

I remember a girl called Johnny
 black as hell and white as a ghost
"Don't talk about life or death"
 she said "I've had enough of both"
A girl called Johnny who was not scared
 they'd have torn her to pieces but
 who would dare?

I remember a girl called Johnny
 the train came to town, boy she got on it
 with no looking back, with not a word
If she said goodbye, well I never heard
 but the noise goes on
 the noise, the jazz
 and the truth is in somebody else's hands
 and the house that a girl called johnny built
 is now just ashes and sand
