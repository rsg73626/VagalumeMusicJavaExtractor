SONG OF THE MERMAID

On a day of days 
 I stood and gazed 
Over the western sea
 I was completely dazed, 
Wide-mouthed and amazed
 when a mermaid called to me

Ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy
 ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy

Like a man in a dream, 
 for an age it seemed
I stood as still as a stone
 while the mermaid sang 
And her melody rang
 like a memory calling me home

Ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy
 ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy

Then the sea and the wind 
 and the shores did spin
And though my resistance was strong
 all the stars in space 
Filled the mermaid's face
 as she captured my will with her song

Ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy
 ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy

Somehow I spoke --
 the enchantment broke
I rubbed my eyes open wide
 like a dream she was gone
All that remained was a song 
 borne on the ebbing tide

Ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy
 ooh-Ooooh Ooooooooooh, my sunny sailor boy
