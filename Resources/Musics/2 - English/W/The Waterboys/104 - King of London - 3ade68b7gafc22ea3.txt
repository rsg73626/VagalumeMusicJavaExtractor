KING OF LONDON

Bobby is the ace of hearts
Karen is the queen
Joe is the knight of the working class
With multi-coloured jeans
Ginger and Rose work for UNICEF
Ride around on a tandem
Me I walk on air
Because I'm the King of London

Alan lives in Bethnal Green
His brother gets into fights
Tony lives in Billericay
Talks politics every night
Sheila worked for meals on wheels
Until the council made her redundant
I'm a self made man
Because I'm the King of London

I'm the King of London
I'm the King of London
Don't need speed to make me run
I can look straight into the sun
Because I'm the King of London town

Keith marched for the right to work
Nothing really changed
Man at the bottom was still underground
Face at the top was the same
After all our well made plans
What went wrong I wonder
And I'm not allowed to ask questions anyway
Because I'm the King of London

Bobby is the ace of hearts
Karen is the queen
Freedom to be who they really are
Is something they've never seen
Whether they make it whether they break
Or whether they just go under
I'm not allowed to surrender anyway
Because I'm the King of London

I'm the King of London
I'm the King of London
Don't need speed to make me run
I can look straight into the sun
Because I'm the King of London town
