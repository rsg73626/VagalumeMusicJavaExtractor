BLEECKER STREET

Bleecker Street, Bleecker Street
Sure like to find you underneath my feet
You make me feel kinda cool and complete
My down home one and only Bleecker Street

They say Broadway can't be beat
and Fifth Avenue is pretty neat
but none of them big boys can compete
with my down home one and only Bleecker Street

I could be
in Hawaii
chasing waves
admiring the sky
London, Paris, Amsterdam...
But I'm just ecstatic
where I am

Life is sexy, life is sweet
in Manhattan's ninety-six degree heat
just pounding tar to my favourite beat
my down home one and only Bleecker Street
