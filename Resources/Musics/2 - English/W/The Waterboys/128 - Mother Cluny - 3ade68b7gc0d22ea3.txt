MOTHER CLUNY

Mother Cluny
 rock me in your womb
Mother Cluny
 rock me in your womb
Take the fear
 and pain I feel
Turn 'em into
 tears that heal
Mother Cluny
 rock me in your womb

Mother Cluny
 suckle me at your breat
Mother Cluny
 suckle me at your breat
Tend the seed
 that love has sown
In the temple of my
 flesh and bone
Mother Cluny
 suckle me at your breast

Mother Cluny
 hold me in your fire
Mother Cluny
 hold me in your fire
That I may shed
 this dead old skin
That I may find
 the fire within
Mother Cluny
 hold me in your fire

Mother Cluny
 clothe and send me forth
Mother Cluny
 clothe and send me forth
To be present
 at the birth
Of the new heaven
 of the new Earth
Mother Cluny
 clothe and send me...
 clothe and send me forth
