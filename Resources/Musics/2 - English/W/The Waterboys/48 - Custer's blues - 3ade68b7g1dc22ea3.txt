CUSTER'S BLUES

Well you look just like General Custer
 on the day of his last stand
Heading up into the black hills
 glorious and grand
I saw it by your side
 a map in your hand
Heading up into the rain
 singing "This land is your land"

Now I've seen your dust a-rising
 and Iâ€™ve seen your numbers swell
I've seen you crossing the badlands
 and I've heard your captains yell
I've watched you when you're sleeping
 I've seen you filling up your can
Thinking as you work
 that this land is your land

But now you're bursting into my country
 you're messing up my fields
You're playing games with my holy places
 you're tearing the earth with your wheels
Right now your star is ascending
 and your head is bursting with pride
But I wonder if Custer was still singing
 â€œThis land is my landâ€ when he died

Was he still singing â€œthis is my landâ€ when he died
 was he singing that itâ€™s my land when he died
Was he singing when he died
 was he singing when he died
Was he singing it's my land when he died
 when he died...
Was he singing when he died
