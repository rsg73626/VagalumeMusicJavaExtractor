SOMETHING THAT IS GONE

Something that is gone
Something that is gone
Something that I had just yesterday
but where I must have laid it
I really couldn't say
Something that was right
but now is wrong
Something that is gone

Something that I lost
Something that I lost
Something that I cradled in my hand
Something rather special
that pertained to all my plans
I'm left here wondering what on earth it was
Something that I lost

Something that I missed
Something that I missed
I've looked all around my room
but it's not here
How can a thing of permanence
so swiftly disappear ?
Something is the cause of all of this
Something that I missed
