HOW MANY SONGS TILL I GET HOME?

I've got a hard road ahead of me
and a battlefield behind
I've got a heavy load on top of me
that's mine and only mine
I can't go running to nobody
solicitating help
I gotta walk a mile and then a mile
and walk it by myself
Ain't no ride on offer
Ain't no easy way
Damn these blues, grease my shoes,
speed me on my way

Lord, how many songs till I get home ?
How many songs till I get home ?
How many rights ? How many wrongs ?
How many songs till I get home ?
Distance unidentified...destiny unknown
How many songs till I get home ?

The devil came to dinner
said he'd been shipwrecked
spit was forming at his mouth
and running down his neck
He beat upon the table
he piped upon a pipe
He cursed in broken english
then he tried to pick a fight
He summoned me to side with him
said I had no choice
When he left I smelt his breath
and I recognized his voice

Lord, how many songs till I get home ?
How many songs till I get home ?
How many rights ? How many wrongs ?
How many songs till I get home ?
Distance unidentified...destiny unknown
How many songs till I get home ?

From the High King of Glory
to the lone abandoned child
everybody has a story
everybody walks a mile
I've told you mine already
I'll tell you just one more
about a son of ancient Israel
You heard his name before
He was suckled in a stable
nailed upon a cross
Before he died he gave a cry
and this is what it was...

Lord, how many songs till I get home ?
How many songs till I get home ?
How many rights ? How many wrongs ?
How many songs till I get home ?
Distance unidentified...destiny unknown
How many songs till I get home ?
