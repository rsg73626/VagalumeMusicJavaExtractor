THE NEW LIFE

I've burned my bridges
 and I'm free at last
All my chains are 
 in the past
The new life starts here

(I was trying to get happy
 I thought it was hard
Until I found that
 in my own back yard
The new life starts here)

The day is wide open
 the sky is blue
The world is a miracle 
 and so are you
The new life starts here

My papers arrived 
 stamped and complete
All previous dispatches 
 are obsolete
The new life starts here

I can see my way so clear
 rejoice for...
The new life starts here

There's a war in the Gulf
 but it ain't in my head
I just declared a state of
 peace instead 
The new life starts here

(Tempters and tricksters
 banging at my door
I'm not fighting with them
 anymore
The new life starts here
/
Users, abusers,
 banging at my door
I'm not fighting with them
 anymore
The new life starts here

Tempsters and tricksters
 wondering how
To seize my attention
 they cannot touch me now
The new life starts here)

Generals, Presidents
 how do you do?
I can make it with or
 without you
The new life starts here

I can see my way so clear 
 rejoice for...
The new life starts here

Are you under the Mercy?
Are you under attack?
Are you going forward?
Are you going back?
The new life starts here

(Are you coming to grips?
Are you coming apart?
Are you listening to fear?
Or to your heart?
The new life starts here
/
Are you building heaven
 or are you building hell?
When that great day comes
 will you be able to tell?
The new life starts here)

Citizen, criminal, child
 woman or man
The keys to the Kingdom
 are in your own hands
The new life starts here

(God of our love
 who ignited the sun
Not my will
 but thine be done
The new life starts here)

Mock the devil 
 make him sweat!
He hasn't won
 the battle yet
The new life starts here

(A whole new age in seven more years
A brave new age in ten more years)
 rejoice for...
The new life starts here
