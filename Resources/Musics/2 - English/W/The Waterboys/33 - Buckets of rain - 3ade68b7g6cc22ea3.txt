BUCKETS OF RAIN

(Bob Dylan)

Buckets of rain, buckets of tears
 got all them buckets coming out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
 you got all the love honey baby I can stand

I been meek
 and hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
 friends will arrive, friends will disappear,
If you want me, honey baby,
 I'll be here

Like your smile
 and your fingertips
Like the way that you move your lips.
 I like the cool way you look at me,
Everything about you is bringing me
 misery

Little red wagon
 little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.
 I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby
 when I go

Life is sad
 life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must.
 you do what you must do and you do it well,
I do it for you, honey baby,
 can't you tell?
