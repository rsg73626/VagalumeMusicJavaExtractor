PRINCE MEDLEY

I'm not your lover
 I'm not your man
I'm something you'll never understand
 'cause I
I will die for you
 you

Well God made you
 and God made me
He made us all equally

How can you just leave me standing
 alone in a world that's cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
 maybe you're just like my father -- too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
 she's never satisfied
How we look to each other
This is what is sounds like
When dust cries
 when dust cries
