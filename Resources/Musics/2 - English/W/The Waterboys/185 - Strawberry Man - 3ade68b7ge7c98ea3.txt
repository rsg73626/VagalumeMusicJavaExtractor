STRAWBERRY MAN

Strawberry man on top of the hill
out of your van on lager and pills
placing your girth slap bang in my way
I hear what it is you're trying to say

Stop the world !
I want to get on
I've a story to tell
and if I don't tell it pretty soon it will be gone

Strawberry man fighting your war
I'm wandering what the hell are you for ?
The sound of your drums is one bum boogaloo
Still your message comes thundering through

Stop the world !
I want to get on
I've a story to tell
and if I don't tell it pretty soon it will be gone

And when he's feeling glum
he looks just like his mum
And when he's feeling sad
he looks just like his dad
just like his dad...

Strawberry man at the end of the day
your and your band need somewhere to stay
Take my car keys, keep my shoes
One day I may need a favour from you

Stop the world !
I want to get on
I've a story to tell
and if I don't tell it pretty soon it will be...
