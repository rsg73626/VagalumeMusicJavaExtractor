DECEMBER

December is the cruelest month
 but this time for once my cheeks are warm
After long years in the monkey-house
 I am ready for the storm
Let them throw all their cannonballs
 let all their strongmen come
I'm ready to go anywhere
 through venom, sick and scum!

December isn't always cold
 but this year she's mine and I know why
Somewhere a flower has to grow
 for every flower that dies
I'm stricken with fever
 but my heart is strong as steel
I'm ready to go anywhere!
 I can believe, I can feel!

December is a trusted friend
 I always recognise her face
It's a plague of fool blown aside
 forever by her soft and silent grace
She is reckless as a Mayday
 gentle as a stone
And ready to go anywhere
 to carry me back home!

December fell deep in the bleak
 mid-winter time when Jesus Christ
Howled a baby saviour's howl
 a primal truth as pure as ice
And though we crucified him on a cross
 and dragged his name from payer to curse
He was able to go anywhere
 he was almost one of us!
