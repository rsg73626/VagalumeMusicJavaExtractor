EVERLASTING ARMS

Lord hold me
 in your everlasting arms
Enfold me
 in your everlasting arms
Let striving cease
 that I may come to rest
In perfect peace
 renewed and truly blessed

Lord bathe me
 in your everlasting light
Lord raise me
 in your everlasting light
Awake my mind 
 that I may understand
And come to find
 the truth of who I am

Above the silvery bay
 a bird rose on the breeze
Then swooped as if to say
 you too may fly away
 with ease

Lord lift me
 in your everlasting love
Home swiftly
 in your everlasting love
I'll go to where
 a temple stands upon a hill
In silence there
   I'll wait upon your will

Lord lift me 
 in your everlasting arms
 in your everlasting arms
