A PAGAN PLACE

How did he come here?
 Who gave him the key?
Slipped it in his hand
 so secretly
And who put the colour
 like lines on his face?
Brought him here 
 to a pagan place

Now who shot his arrow?
 how high did it fly?
When he tipped it with poison
 did he even know why?
What unseen hand
 brought him face to face to face to face with
All this and more
 in a pagan place?

Come into my parlour
 sail in at my shore
Drink my soul dry
 there is always more
There is always more after now
 fly on my carpet
Look into my face
 see the heart of man
 in a pagan
 in a pagan
 in a pagan
 in a pagan
 in a pagan
 pagan...
