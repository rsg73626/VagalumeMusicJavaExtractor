LONESOME OLD WIND

Though I try
hard as I can to fly free
that lonesome old wind keeps blowing me

I would stay
where your loving warms me night and day
close to thee
but that lonesome old wind keeps blowing me

You say this time
I must be out of my mind
Oh and I'm sure it's true
But that old wind is bending me
that old wind is sending me
and letting go is all I know how to do

Sometimes
there's a small boy in this head of mine
whispers "let it be"
but that lonesome old wind keeps blowing me

Your say I'm cruel
and you call me a fool
Oh yes and I agree
but that old wind is driving me
it wrestles and it writhes in me
and alone is all I know how to be

And when I fall
burst and broken, barely fit to crawl
hand to knee
that lonesome old wind keeps blowing me
