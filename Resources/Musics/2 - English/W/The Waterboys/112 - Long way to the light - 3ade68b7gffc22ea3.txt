LONG WAY TO THE LIGHT

I'm sitting in my bedroom
overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill ion the distance
summer on the way
Blue skies and sailing boats
like a picture in a book
I can't believe I got here
or how long it took

Living one step at a time
putting one foot in front of the other
it sure feels right
Healing on my mind
been a long way
been a long way to the light

I'd made it to Manhattan
built myself a nest
I meant to get right back to doing
exactly what I do best:
Pluggin in an electric guitar,
leading a band
Well, if you want to give God a laugh
 - tell him your plans!

 Summer in the city
wilting in the heat
buzzing up and down to Bearsville
and back to Hudson Street
I learned meditation
and how to visualise -
just breathing, being still
 never felt more alive!

Living one step at a time...

I spent the fall in transit
circling the moon
like a cat on a hot tin roof
like a fiddle without a tune
I found what I was searching for
in Mrs Caddy's book
I had to go there straightaway
 have myself a look

 I flew back to Scotland
anticipation in my bones
the old country welcoming me
like a prodigal coming home
I knelt and kissed the tarmac
in the wild atlantic rain
felt the fiery gaelic blood
 rising in my veins

Living one step at a time...

I spent the night in Glasgow
flew to Inverness
I found the Place and at the first
I was not impressed
Nobody said hello
the faces left me cold
Back then how was I to know
 all that would unfold?

I entered thje Sanctuary
- heard the vioce of a girl
sending out a circle of light
clear across the world
I shuddered in the Power
like a seedling in a storm
I've been travelling to this place
 since the moment I was born

Flew back to New York City
singing the big city blues
the sand of Findhorn Bay
still clingin to my shoes
I tried to re-start my life
but the life I knew was gone
I had to let go everything
 but that's another song!

Living one step at a time...

So I'm sitting in my bedroom
overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill in the distance
summer on the way
I'm watching sailing boats
bobbing to and fro
- time to hit the road
the only way I know...

Living one step at a time...
