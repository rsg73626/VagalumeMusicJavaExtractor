THE RETURN OF PAN

I stood upon the balcony with my brand new bride
 the clink of bells came drifting down the mountainside
When in our sight something moved
 - lightning eyed and cloven hooved -
The great god Pan is alive!

He moves amid the modern world in disguise
 it's possible to look into his immortal eyes
He's like a man you'd meet anyplace
 Until you recognise that ancient face
The great god Pan is alive!

At sea on a ship in a thunder storm
 on the very night that Christ was born
A sailor heard from overhead
 a mighty voice cry "Pan is dead!"
So follow Christ as best you can 
 Pan is dead! Long Live Pan!

From the olden days and up through all the years
 from Arcadia to the stone fields of Inisheer
Some say the Gods are just a myth
 but guess who I've been dancing with
The great god Pan is alive!
