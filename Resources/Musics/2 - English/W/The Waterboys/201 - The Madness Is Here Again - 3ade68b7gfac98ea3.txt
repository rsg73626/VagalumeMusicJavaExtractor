THE MADNESS IS HERE AGAIN

I can't sleep
I can't get my breath
I can't stop talkin'
and I look like death
The madness...
The madness...
The madness is here again !

My hands are tied
I'm nailed to the floor
I feel like I'm knockin'
on the unknown door
The madness...
The madness...
The madness is here again !

Now the wrecker busts loose
he's swinging a chain
shouting out something
that sounds like my name
The madness...
The madness...
The madness is here again !

Can you feel it ?
Can you feel it coming ?
