ALL THE BOYS LOVE CARRIE

All the boys love Carrie
 but Carrie doesn't love the boys
She drinks and she talks
 she takes cigarettes from strangers
Anything else she's an x-rated baby
 out of bounds
 
All the boys love Carrie!
 They watch her over cider and whiskey
Take her outside, show her their cars, invite her thru to the cocktail bar
 but Carrie's shy, she don't talk much
She keeps her secrets locked inside
 Out of bounds
 
I saw her today in her green coat
 I know she's going... uptown downtown!
She's gotta run 'cause it's getting late
 What can she do when her world blows open in her face?
 
All the boys love Carrie but
 Carrie doesn't love the boys
