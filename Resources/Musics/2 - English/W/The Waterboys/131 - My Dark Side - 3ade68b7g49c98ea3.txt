MY DARK SIDE

Draw in close lady bride
take a look at my dark side
I can't show this to anyone
but you my close and intimate one

My dark side
My dark side

You've got my trust and that's a fact
but please be careful how you act
Drop the jury, leave 'em home
I won't be judged - only known

My dark side
My dark side

I may resist and I may fight
but I couldn't pass here without your light
Don't withdraw, don't disengage
Hold your fire when you touch his cage

My dark side
My dark side

Love's alive in your cheeks
Please don't die when he speaks
Only love can walk between
the parts that fear and need to be seen

All my defences and all my ploys
are to protect a little boy
I can't show him to anyone
but you my close and intimate one

My dark side
My dark side
My dark side
My dark side....

I've been hurt
but I'm alright
because underneath
there is a Light !
