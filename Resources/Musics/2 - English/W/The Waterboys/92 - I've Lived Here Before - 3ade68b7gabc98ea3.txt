I'VE LIVED HERE BEFORE

I've lived here before in days of old
I recognise these buildings in my soul
I know each winding road
And every rise
Is friendly and familiar to my eyes

I've lived here before i do believe
I have rejoiced in these fields and i've grieved
I can feel it in my blood
That i belong
To this strange and stony rock i stand upon

Yet i cannot put a name upon it
I cannot place the time
Nor see the land as it once was
Nor tell which house was mine
No i cannot put a name upon it
Which was where and when
Yet here i am
A perfect stranger
Home again

There's confusion in my head as i depart
But a singing, ringing, soaring in my heart
For beyond all time and space and doubt
I know
I've lived here before
Long ago
