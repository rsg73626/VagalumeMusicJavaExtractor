A GOLDEN AGE

I heard a rumour of a golden age
 and the stage is gettin' set
I heard a rumour of a golden age
 the stage is gettin' set
I heard a rumour of a golden age
 in the song, on a screen and printed page
And all the world will be a stage
 and the stage is gettin' set

I've seen the glow of a golden dawn
 and the dawn is comin' through
I've seen the glow of a golden dawn
 and the dawn is comin' through
I've seen the glow of a golden dawn
 and all will wait to gaze upon
And though the hour is hard and long
 the dawn is coming through

I felt the wind behind my heels
 and it feels good to me
I felt the wind behind my heels
 and it feels good to me
I felt the wind behind my heels
 My soul fired up like catherine wheels
And I'm never gonna forget how it feels
 and it feels good to me

I stood on the side of a shimmering sea
 I saw a ship come sailing in
I stood on the side of a shimmering sea
 I saw a ship come sailing in
I stood on the side of a shimmering sea
 said "Lord, I surrender" and fell on my knees
And loving rose in the heart of me
 And the ship came sailing in

I heard a rumour of a golden age
