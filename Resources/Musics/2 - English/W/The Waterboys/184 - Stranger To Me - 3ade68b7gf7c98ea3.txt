STRANGER TO ME

If you're thinking of leaving tomorrow
If you're planning on closing a door
If you're cutting your ties
and shutting your eyes
on all the good that's gone before
I won't say a word to dissuade you
and I have no truth to make you see
For I'm long since through with talking
and you're long since a stranger to me

If you're humbling yourself before your maker
If you're preparing for yourself to take a bow
If you're cleansing your soul
and attending your woe
heading for the heartland in a plough
I won't say a word to dissuade you
No I will not disturb your reverie
For I'm long since through with talking
and you're long since a stranger to me

Your eyes are full of promise
and your winter coat is warm
Your house is fine and your vanities are like mine
You're the perfect port in any storm
And your hair is the colour of morning
and your trust comes absolutely free
and your soul is as high as Mount Etna
but your loving is a stranger to me
