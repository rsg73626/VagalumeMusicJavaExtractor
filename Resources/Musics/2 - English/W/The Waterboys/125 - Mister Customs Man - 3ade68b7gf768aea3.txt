MISTER CUSTOMS MAN

Good morning Mister Customs Man
how do you do today ?
I ain't got much in my bag
but I guess you're gonna check 'em anyway
You're always hunting and searching
and looking for something
What it is you will not say
There's no false bottom in my suitcase
no surprises in my clothes
No bootleg liquor in my bottle
nothing but holes in my coat
but still you're hunting and searching
and looking for something
What it is God only knows !

I've got a woman back in London 
treats me like a king
I know three girls down in Dublin
who love to dance and sing
(the only trouble is)
they're always hunting and searching
and looking for something
they call the real thing

Now I can see Mister Customs Man
you're a busy cat
and it's really such a shame
you don't have time to stop and chat
For all your hunting and searching
well I'll tell you something...
It's under my hat !
