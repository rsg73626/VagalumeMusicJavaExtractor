FURTHER UP, FURTHER IN

I dreamed the wind came to my house
 these are the words fell from his mouth
"The King you seek you'll find him true
 but only if he rides the road with you"

I stepped aboard a ship that flew
 it took me to wherever it wanted to
Far above the land, far above the sea
 the dreamer and the doer agreed to agree

I was sent to the war, stripped of my power
 gagged and imprisoned in a tall dark tower
I must have cried for an age or more
 'till I saw through tears and I found the door

High on a cliff, in gorgeous clothes
 a madman danced on the balls of his toes
Forgetting myself I fell at the feet
 of the greatest Fool I ever did meet

The stars were bright and magic afoot
 on the Summer wind rose the sound of a flute
I saw the musician - my heart knew him well
 What happens next, no rhyme can tell

We came to the end of the world one day
 a dolphin swan in a sheltered bay
I paid to the King what it was I owed,
 put my face to the wind and my foot on the road

I find I've wandered far from home
 but home is in me wherever I roam
I thought I was an hour or a year behind
 but the hours and the years are only time
