THE BIG MUSIC

I have heard the big music
 and I'll never be the same
Something so pure
 just called my name

I have drowned in the big sea
 now I find I'm still alive
And I'm coming up for ever
 shadows all behind me, ecstacy to come

I have
 climbed the big tree
Touched the big sky
 I just stuck my hand up in the air
And everything came into colour
 like Jazz mana from sweet, sweet chariots

I have seen the big mountain
 and I swear I'm halfway there

(You'll never get there, you'll never get there, you'll never get there)

But I will, I will always climb the mountain
 because...

I have heard the big music
 and I'll never be the same
Something so pure
 has called my name
