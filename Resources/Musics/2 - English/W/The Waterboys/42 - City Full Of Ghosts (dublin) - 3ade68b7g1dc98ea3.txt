CITY FULL OF GHOSTS (DUBLIN)

Dublin is a city full of good times
Dublin is a city full of dance
Dublin is a city full of music,
poetry, sex and romance
but what it means to me the most -
Dublin is a city full of ghosts

Dublin is a city full of tricksters
Dublin is a city full of priests
Dublin is a city full of rumours
seventy two thousand at least
but what it means to me the most -
Dublin is a city full of ghosts

The ghosts of my joy, the ghosts of my tears,
the ghosts of my glorious dissolute years
the ghost of adventure wilder than words
the ghost of the night I first made love to her

Dublin is a city full of humour
Dublin is a city full of wit
Dublin is a city full of buskers
playing old Waterboys hits
but what it means to me the most -
Dublin is a city full of ghosts

The ghost of a fiddle
the ghost of a sax
the ghost of a sound that ain't never coming back
the ghost of a friendship, curdled and sour
the ghost of a time when I still had the power

Dublin is a city full of magic
Dublin is a city full of light
Dublin is a city full of wonder
Dublin is a city full of shite
but what it means to me the most -
Dublin is a city full of ghosts
