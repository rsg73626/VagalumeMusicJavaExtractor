THIS LIGHT IS FOR THE WORLD

this light is for the world
this light is for the world

send out from this wooden frame
a beacon made of holy flame
like a bridge across the morning sky
from candle to the hills of high

this light is for the world
this light is for the world

send it out with sword of fire,
with cymbal, drum and angel choir,
music in the heart of it
proclaiming that the lamp is lit

this light is for the world
this light is for the world

bring it down from where the light is born
deep into the world of form
loving, blessing, healing as it shines
in darkened places, darkened minds

this light is for the world
this light is for the world
