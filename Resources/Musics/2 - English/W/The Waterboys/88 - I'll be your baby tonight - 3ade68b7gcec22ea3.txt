I'LL BE YOUR BABY TONIGHT

(Bob Dylan)

Close your eyes
 shut the door
You don't have to worry anymore
 I'll be your baby tonight

Dim the lights
 roll down the shades
You don't have to be afraid
 I'll be your baby tonight

Oh that mocking bird is gonna sail away, and we're gonna forget it
 the big bad moon is gonna shine like a spoon, we're gonna let it
 you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off, do not fear
 bring your bottle over hrere
 I'll be your baby tonight

Oh that mocking bird is gonna sail away, and we're gonna forget it
 the big bad moon is gonna shine like a spoon, we're gonna let it
 you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off, do not fear
 bring your bottle over hrere
 Because I'll be your baby tonight
