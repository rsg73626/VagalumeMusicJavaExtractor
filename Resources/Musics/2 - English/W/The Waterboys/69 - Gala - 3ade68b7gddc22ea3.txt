GALA

Gala hangs from the window frame
 dressed in black and white
Her face is colourless
 in the moonlight
She turns around and her lips move
 but the words just drop away
She leans on the back of a chair
 and her arms begin to sway
She and I can hear voices
 talking in the room next door
Saying things we used to say
 that we can't believe in any more
We've seen too many castles crumble
 made too many innocent mistakes
Who could have known that one house
 could hold so much heartbreak?

And then the clockbell rings
 the wind blows in - 
Gala makes for the door.
Her eyes blaze
 and her hands are shaking
She opens her mouth and ROARS!
 Gala doesn't want, Gala doesn't need
She claws at her face 
 with her nails till it bleeds
She runs down the stairs
 in her poor bare-feet
She's too woman to cry or go down on her knees
 then her mother is there
And her voice is soft
 she pulls Gala close
She soothes Gala's cuts
 and gently chides
And Gala knows...

That Gala shouldn't worry
 she needn't be afraid
Because there are sailors on the sea tonight
 in ships that God made
Look! They cast out the line
 with a "heave two-three-four"
And they sing as they pull
 our lost souls aboard
