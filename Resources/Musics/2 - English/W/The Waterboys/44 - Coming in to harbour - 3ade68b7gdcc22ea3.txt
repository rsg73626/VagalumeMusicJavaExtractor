COMING IN TO HARBOUR

Well I dreamed I saw you sailing in upon a sleek white schooner
 you were slipping over shallow water
You were coming into harbour, you were coming into harbour
 with the wind in all your sails

You were carrying a cargo that was richer than riches
 more gold than gold and much more real than real
New born babe in your arms and his cool blue eyes gazed up
 yes his cool eyes gazed upon a fresh world, one yet to be made

I was standing on the shoreline looking out over the sea
 and I saw your white sail appearing on the horizon
I was standing on the shoreline just looking out over the sea
 and I saw your white sail appearing on the horizon
You were coming into harbour, you were coming into harbour
 in the bright light, the bright light, longer than the 20th century
