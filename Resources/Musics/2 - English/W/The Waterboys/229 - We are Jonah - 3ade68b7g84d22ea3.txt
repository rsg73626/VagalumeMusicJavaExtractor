WE ARE JONAH

And the round old fox, stepped up to make his speech
 his ship was on the rocks, and rescue out of reach
Spotlit he stood, said what he thought he should
 half the crowd did laugh, though there was no joke
And soon the other half were swallowed up in smoke
 a robin on the wing, could be heard to sing, the strangest thing

Grandma, we are Jonah
 rolling along in the teeth of a whale

Then the plane did land, for some it did not crash
 from it emerged a man, in trainers and moustache
Down he laid his load, upon the heated road
 then the road did part, and the tar did melt
He loosened up his heart, he tightened up his belt
 like a piece of string, then he began to sing, like a pearly king

Grandma, we are Jonah
 rolling along in the teeth of a whale

Then the scene did shift, to a sun kissed sea
 there was Montgomery Clift, Jonah, the Whale and me
As the sun it set, Montgomery placed his bet
 then the whale did yawn, and fell asleep in four
From dusk till dawn, you shoul have heard him snore
 from Tierra-Del-Fuego, to the Alaskan Snows... there she blows!

Grandma, we are Jonah
 rolling along in the teeth of a whale
My dear old Grandma, we are Jonah
 rolling along in the teeth of a whale
Grandma
 we are Jonah, rolling along in the teeth of a whale
