HEAVEN GETS CLOSER EVERY DAY

I was talking to Barry who says there's a change in the air
 he's just found a magic kite that can fly him anywhere
He leans on his window as the trash daytime radio plays
 he's got all the shelter he needs, and heaven gets closer everyday

I got a postcard from Mandy; the farmers are bringing in the hay
 our friends will be home in the morning, and heaven gets closer... everyday

We don't think too much about a crisis in the west
 because it couldn't happen here again and anyway; all men are equally blessed
They say a war is coming but it all seems so far away
 because where we live the sun shines, and heaven gets closer everyday

I got a postcard from Mandy; the farmers are bringing in the hay
 our friends will be home in the morning, and heaven gets closer... everyday

I got a letter from London; tanks are rolling over the hay
 soldiers will be here in the morning, and heaven gets closer...
