ANATOMY OF A LOVE AFFAIR

You got me cheap, wherein I was wounded
 back in the days of woe
You got me cheap, wherein I was wounded
 back in the days of woe

I then deceived us, I then deceived us,
 I then deceived us both
You used your lure then sex and affection
 to train me like a beast

I left the money be, I left the money be,
 I left the money behind
I left the money be, I left the money be
 I left the money behind
