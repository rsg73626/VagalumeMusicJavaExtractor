A ROCK IN A WEARY LAND

My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
Yes my love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land

None of this moves me,
 I should be weeping but it only hurts when I yawn
I let it blow through me, and it's gone!
 I'm dressed like a scarecrow
Stripped of all my power, as if some judge in judgement said
 "Off with his great coat, and his head!"

My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land

Meaningless movies
 on the screen behind the band that's blowing flowing shapes
Half of their music is on tape
My mentor and champion is busy tilting at the windows of his stately home
The daemon he's grappling
 is his own!

My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
Yes my love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land

His letter lies open
 his accusations flow like poison from his every word
My heart would be broken, but for her
The fag-end of Winter
I'm in shock! I'm on the ropes! I don't know what's become!
She plucks the splinter from my thumb

My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
Yes my love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land
My love is my rock
 in the long, low, weary land

in the weary land!
My rock in a weary land
 My rock in a weary land
My love is my rock in a weary land
 My love is my rock in a weary land
In a weary land
 hey!
A rock in a weary land

A rock in a weary land
 A rock in a weary land
My love is my rock in a weary land
 My love is my rock in a weary land
My love is my rock is my rock in a weary land
My love is my rock is my love is my rock in a weary land
My love is my rock is my love is my rock in a weary land
My love is my rock is my love is my rock is my love is my rock is my love is my rock is my love is my rock is my love is my rock in a weary land
in a weary land!
