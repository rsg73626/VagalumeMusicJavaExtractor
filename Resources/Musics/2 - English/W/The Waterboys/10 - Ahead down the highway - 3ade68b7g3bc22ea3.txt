AHEAD DOWN THE HIGHWAY

I'm heading down this highway
 I'm heading down this road
I'm heading down this highway
 it's a long road, I'm told

But I don't mind
 no, no, no and I don't care
It's a hundred-thousand miles we've gotta go
 Yeah!

I'm sailing on this ocean
 I'm sailing on this sea
I'm sailing on this ocean
 to see what you can see

But I don't mind
 no, no, no and I don't care
It's a hundred-thousand miles I've gotta go
 Yeah!

I'm climbing through this forest
 I'm climbing through the wood
Sometimes it's hard to see the light
 but I know you could

But I don't mind
 no, no, no and I don't care
It's a hundred-thousand miles I've gotta go
 Yeah!

I'm drifting through the desert
 drifting through the sands
Climbing all the mountains
 checking out the land
Running with the rivers
 racing up the shore
And jumping off the cliffs, boys
 'cause all I want is more, all I want is more
And it won't be long now
 'till we'll be knock-knock-knocking on your door
And it won't be long now
 'till we'll be knock-knock-knocking on your door
And it won't be long now
 'till we'll be knock-knock-knocking on your door

We're heading down this highway
 we're heading down this road
We're heading down this highway
 It's a long road, I'm told
But I don't mind
 no, no, no and we don't care
It's a hundred-thousand miles we've gotta go
 Yeah!
