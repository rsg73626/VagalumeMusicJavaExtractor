FATHER

Oh father, what happened to you
 did you have more urgent affairs to attend to?
Did business press, or did you just get bored
 thrown half your life through a one way door?
Sometimes it scares me, look in the mirror
 and see myself growing up looking like you
No I don't have much time to waste getting worried
 I've got more urgent affairs of my own to attend to

Father, what happened to you
 haven't seen you in a whole decade
Did you ever learn, did you ever grow up
 are you still as weak, do I make you feel afraid?
Do you tell your friends there's a son somewhere?
 Did you ever wonder how he looks?
Did anyone ever give you my number?
 Say here's two pence 'cos my phone's off the hook
