GULF CRISIS LULLABY

Space is always getting bigger
 time just keeps moving on
Take your finger off the trigger
 you ain't gonna shoot that gun

Roads are always leading somewhere
 dreams are always being dreamed
That black cloud on the horizon
 its not as big as it seems

No, you may believe it or not, but hear what I say
 this old boat of ours is bound for better days

Fools will always have an answer
 cheats will always tell a lie
They don't have to take us over
 just let them pass you by

Luck is always being lucky
 fate is always being fate
There's really no need to hurry
 you aint gonna be late

No, you may believe it or not, but hear what I say
 this old boat of ours is bound for better days

Age is always getting older
 youth is always being born
Come on climb in here beside me
 and keep your lover warm
