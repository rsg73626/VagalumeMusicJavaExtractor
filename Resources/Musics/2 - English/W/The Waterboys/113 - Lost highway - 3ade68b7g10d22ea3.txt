LOST HIGHWAY

I'm a rolling stone
 all alone and lost
For a life of sin
 I have paid the cost
When I pass by
 all the people say
He's just another guy
 on the lost highway

Just a deck of cards
 and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies
 make a life like mine
The day we met
 I went astray
I started rollin' down
 that lost highway

Now boys don't start
 all your ramblin' around
On tihs road of sin
 you are solemn bound
Take my advice
 or you'll curse the day
You start rollin' down
 that lost highway
