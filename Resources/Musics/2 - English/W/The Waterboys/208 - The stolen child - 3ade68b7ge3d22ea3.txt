THE STOLEN CHILD

(WB Yeats)

Come away, human child 
 to the water
Come away, human child 
 to the water and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand
 for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand

Where dips the rocky highland
 of Sleuth Wood in the lake
There lies a leafy island
 where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats;
 there we've hid our faery vats
Full of berries
 and of reddest stolen cherries

Come away, human child 
 to the water
Come away, human child 
 to the water and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand
 for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand

Where the wave of moonlight glosses
 the dim gray sands with light
Far off by furthest Rosses
 we foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
 mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight;
 to and fro we leap
ANd chase the frothy bubbles
 while the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep

Come away, human child 
 to the water
Come away, human child 
 to the water and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand
 for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand

Where the wandering water gushes
 from the hills above Glen-Car
In pools among the rushes
 the scarce could bathe a star
We seek for slumbering trout
 and whispering in their ears
We give them unquiet dreams;
 leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
 over the young streams

Away with us he's going
 the solemn-eyed:
He'll hear no more the lowing
 of the calves on the warm hillside;
Or the kettle on the hob
 sing peace into his breast
Or see the brown mice bob
 around and around the oatmeal-chest

For he comes, the human child
 to the water
He comes, the human child
 to the water and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand
 from a world more full of weeping than he can understand
Human child
 human child
With a faery, hand in hand
 from a world more full of weeping than he can understand...
 than he can understand...
 he can understand...
