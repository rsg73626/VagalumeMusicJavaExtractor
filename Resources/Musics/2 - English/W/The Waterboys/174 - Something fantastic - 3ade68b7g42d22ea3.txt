SOMETHING FANTASTIC

Call her Ruth
 'cos she knows the price
Call her Sandy
 'cos heart is like ice
You can call her
 whatever you wish
Nothing can change
 the person she is

Call her Maria
 her real name's Eve
Try not to slam the door
 or you'll wake her as you leave
You can tell by
 the pictures on her wall
That she never really
 knew you at all

Everywhere I look
 it's just looking into waste
I can't see any courage
 or hope in your face
You say there's no point
 of searching anymore
'Cos whatever I find
 I'll have found before

I must be looking
 for something fantastic!
And all this reality
 it's such a test
You take what you're given
 and I'll take my time
You in your small corner
 and I in mine
