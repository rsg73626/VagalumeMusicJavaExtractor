WHEN LOVE COMES TUMBLING

Iâ€™ve had money, and Iâ€™ve lost it
 seen an ocean, nearly crossed it
I have been to another world and I have returned
 and for every high joy a hard lesson learnt

But when love comes tumbling down
 I will wear a crown

Iâ€™ve had power, Iâ€™ve used and abused it
 tasted glory, I have wooed and refused it
Tried to live in a sacred way, I did and I did not
 and for everything Iâ€™ve lost, thereâ€™s been something else Iâ€™ve got

But when love comes tumbling down
 I will wear a crown

Iâ€™ve been up and Iâ€™ve been down
 sometimes almost level with the ground
Once in every hundred years I can
 still remember who I am

Been in danger, I tried to face it
 I saw a mirage, and for seven years I chased it
Iâ€™m not through with my changes,
 Iâ€™ve got a long way still to run
Iâ€™m going to play this show even if nobody comes

But when love comes tumbling down
 when love comes tumbling down
When love comes tumbling down
 I will wear a crown
