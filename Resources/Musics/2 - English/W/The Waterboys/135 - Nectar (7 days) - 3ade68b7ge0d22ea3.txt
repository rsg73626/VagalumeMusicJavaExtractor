NECTAR (7 DAYS)

The nectar flowed for seven days
Seven sweet days
As if a cloak of wild and deep emotion
Urgent, thrilling, enveloped and intoxicated me
And in the centre a huge, pumping, ball of fire
My heart

Love has changed my life
Love has changed my life

Nights I lay awake, pinned and thrilled, to my bed
In sanctuary I sat wrapped
Super-alive, listening
At work I thrived
Tired but not tired.
Alert, compassionate, driven
And love, the driver

Love has changed my life
Love has changed my life

Yes, love was the lord of all-ness
And love aflame the nectar
And love unconditional the trigger, the initiator
The nectar flowed for seven days
Then river-like sped underground again
Leaving me the same, but not the same
Empty, but not empty
Unchanged, but changed

Love has changed my life
Love has changed my life
Love has changed my life!
Love has changed my life!
Yes...
