SEAWEED SHOVELLING SONG

This is my seaweed shovelling song
 I've been shovelling all day long
I've got got my seaweed shovel in hand
 because I'm a seaweed shovelling man

Green weed, red weed, still alive and dead weed
 lying in a pile on the shore
Brown weed, pink weed, smelly kind of stink weed
 who on earth could ask for more!

This is my seaweed shovelling song
 I've been shovelling all day long
I've got got my seaweed shovel in hand
 because I'm a seaweed shovelling man

Dry weed, wet weed, ain't-been-troubled-yet weed
 glinting in the morning sun
Thin weed, thick weed, slimy kind of slick weed
 every bucket weighs a ton!

This is my seaweed shovelling song
 I've been shovelling all day long
I've got got my seaweed shovel in hand
 because I'm a seaweed shovelling
seaweed shovelling
seaweed shovelling
seaweed shovelling man!
