THE WIND IN THE WIRES

Wake lady wake 
 the hills are in flood.
And the road we must take 
 is a river of blood.
And the wind in the wires
 and your heart like a cup
And Iâ€™m down in the war
 and youâ€™ve got to get up

For mercyâ€™s sake
 wake lady wake

Dress lady dress
 put on your (jacket/skull-cap) and boots.
For the (thief/priest) has confessed
 and the chase is afoot.
And the hounds are behind 
 gunmen around every tree
And if itâ€™s all in our minds
 well, where else would it be

I suggest
 you dress lady, dress

This is the day, this is the day this is, 
 this is the day, this is, this is the day the day
This is the day

This is the day, this is the day this is, 
 this is the day the day, this is the day the day
This is the day

Our kingdom will crash
 like a sad piece of trash

(Swim Lady swim 
 the whole river across
Though our chances are slim
 and weâ€™re totally lost!
/
Swim Lady swim 
 Lady, don't refuse
Though our chances are slim
 and weâ€™re totally confused!)
There are clues to be found
 oh, and Iâ€™d ask my peers
But theyâ€™re all dumbing down
 until this bad weather clears

Weâ€™re out on a limb
 so swim lady, swim

This is the day, this is the day the day
 this is the day, this is the day
This is the day
 this is the day, this is the day the day
This is the day, this is the day the day
 this is the day

The kingdom will crash
 like an old piece of trash
