WONDERFUL DISGUISE

Through the curtains the daylight crept
I looked at my lover as she slept
and as I watched her face I wept...
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise

As I was driving into town
the guy in the next car turned around
and as I met his gaze I found
it was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise

Outside the museum I was addressed
by a blind man in his pants and vest
I was most impressed
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise

Fat woman, standing in a queue
Her hat, shoes, coat and gloves were blue
and when she turned around I knew
it was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise

I came home and halfway up the stair
a drunk was tearing out his hair
You should have heard him scream and swear
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise

The President was on the News at Ten
looking like he could use a friend
and then I looked again
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise

Stood in front of the mirror all alone,
examined my features skin and bone,
looked at this face I've always known
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
