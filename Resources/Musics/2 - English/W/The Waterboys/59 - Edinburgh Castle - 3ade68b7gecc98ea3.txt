EDINBURGH CASTLE

I woke up in the morning
seven twenty-four
Drank a cup of coffee
stepped out the door
I said Goodbye
to my old best friend
I took a ride
to the old West End

I walked along Princes Street
my feet were hurting bad
as I squirmed inside my shoes
I was thinking about my dad
There was the bones of a song
beatin' around my head
Unless I remember it wrong
this is what it said :

Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down

I jumped on a bus
a trusty number 23
to the Royal Botanical Gardens
where a ghost was calling me
I saw a brace of weeping willows,
a burnt and withered land
I saw a man and a little boy
holding hands

I scanned the skyline
It was like the backdrop of a play
I never saw your heartless beauty
until I'd been away
As I was climbing up The mound
it struck me like a chime
I must have dreamed this scene
about a thousand times !

Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down

I found myself on Forrest Road
feeling pretty sore
This city once was mine
but it ain't mine anymore
And here's my old school, "Jingling Geordie's"
and I must confess
I couldn't step through that gate
until I'm better dressed

Back at Waverly Station
half dead on my feet
I got on board the four forty-four,
promptly fell asleep
I woke up in Queen Street
at my journey's end
I've got to say it's totally great
to be back in Glasgow again !

Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of my town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down
