COME LIVE WITH ME

(Ray Charles)

Come live with me and be my love
 share my bread and wine
Be a part of me, the heart of me
 be mine

Come live with me and be my love
 let our dreams combine
Be wife to me, be life to me
 be mine

With these hands I will build a roof
 to shield your head
And with these hands I will carve the wood
 for our baby's bed

Come live with me and be my love
 and let me love you all the time
Be mate to me, be fate to me 
 be mine

I will try to do my best for you
 I swear, I promise you
I will cry for you, I will comfort you
 my whole life through

Come live with me and be my love
 share my bread and wine
Be a part of me, be the heart of me
 be mine
