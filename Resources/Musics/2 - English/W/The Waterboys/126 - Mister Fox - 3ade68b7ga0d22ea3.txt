MISTER FOX

Fields sing a Winter song
Jack Frost is here again
Dressed in a cape of the blackest black silk
Looking for his oldest old friend
But nobody's seen Mister Fox
No-one has seen Mister Fox

Reds and blues dart between the trees
And this time the sky is really falling
Jack looks hard through the bracken and the thorns
Listen Hey! Hear him calling
But nobody's seen Mister Fox
Nobody's seen Mister Fox

Fields sing a November tale
Jack is up, set to leave
And as he spreads his cape he's blissfully unaware
Of the wild eyes watching from the trees
But not does he see Mister Fox
He never sees Mister Fox
