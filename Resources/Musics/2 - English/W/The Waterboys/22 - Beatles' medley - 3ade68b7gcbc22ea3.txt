BEATLES' MEDLEY

We're Sergeant Pepper's lonely hearts club band
 we're sorry but it's time to go
Sergeant Pepper's one and only lonely hearts club band
 we hope you did enjoy the show
Sergeant Pepper's lonely, Sergeant Pepper's lonely
 Sergeant Pepper's lonely hearts club band...

Sergeant Pepper's one and only lonely hearts club band!

We were talking about the space between our song!

Ain't nothing you can do that can't be done!

It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log!

Help! I need somebody!
 Help!

She's a big teaser!
 She took me half the way there!

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast!

Get back, get back
 Get back to where you once belonged!
Get back, get back
 Get back to where you once belonged!

She loves you yeah yeah yeah!
 She loves you yeah yeah yeah!
She loves you yeah yeah yeah!
 She loves you yeah!

Sergeant Pepper's one and only lonely hearts club band!
