BORN TO BE TOGETHER

I want to star in your life
and on the stage of your dreams
in your beginning and your end
and every place between
to open the door of your secret soul
steal in and stay forever
the streets of you heart are laid with gold
and we were born to be together

Let's build a ship and set sail
through seas of love we'll go
to unknown lands and hidden bays
and when there's no wind I'll blow
and when the waves get high and the broadsides fly
I will be your port in stormy weather
I'll rock your bow and show you how
we were born to be together
