DRUNKEN HEAD BLUES

Well the bricks are piled on Main Street
 and the sun is turning brown
Anybody with any sense
 has already left town
The beast is hollering lonesome
 and the ghost of Rimbaud rides
I've got a drunken head full of reasons why
 I've got a broken heart inside

I can hear a dog someplace barking
 I hear the wind begin to moan
At night I walk these rain splattered streets
 dead on my feet and all alone
My dreams begin to crumble
 I can feel the downward slide
I've got a drunken head full of reasons why
 I've got a broken heart inside

I have seen all of my dreams
 slipping away like sand
Love has grown wings and left me
 flown right out of my hand
Now I'm weary and bruised from singing the blues
 and my fortunes are down
My face and my walk are known
 in every bar and dive in town
You can ask me where am I going
 but I'll let your question ride
I've got a drunken head full of reasons why
 I've got a broken heart inside

I've got a handful of mist
 I've got a barrel of it
What do I do with it
 now I've got no place to run
And I've got no place to hide
 all my trials, all my cares
All my worries, all my pride
 all my sins, all my troubles
They're being washed in by the tide
 And I wish, how I wish
That I could get on that horse
 And ride and ride, ride and ride, ride and ride
Onto the other side
 ride on to the other side
 ride on to the other side
 ride on to the other side
 ride on to the other side, the other side, the other side...

Now I've got a pain in my soul
 and it's fifteen miles wide
Now I've got a pain in my soul
 and it's fifteen miles wide
Now I've got a pain in my soul
 and it's fifteen miles wide
I've got a drunken head full of reasons why
 I've got a broken heart inside
