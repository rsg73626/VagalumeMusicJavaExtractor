THE THRILL IS GONE

I'm too tired to deceive you
 we can't pretend there's nothing wrong
Who'll be the first to say it?
 that the thrill is gone
And we never get it back...

When we talk of old aquaintance and
 speak like two strangers all day long
The only four words that I hear
 are "the thrill is gone"
And we never get it back...

When evening falls magenta
 and goodnight hangs on and on
I won't need to go to sleep and dream to tell me
 that the thrill is gone
And we never get it back...
