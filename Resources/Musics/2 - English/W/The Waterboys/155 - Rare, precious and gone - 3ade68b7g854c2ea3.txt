RARE, PRECIOUS AND GONE

Cry baby boy, not tears of joy
 the one you held is no longer your toy
She's got her new boots and her make up on
 you can call her your friend
But not your lover again
 she's made it clear as air that this affair is at an end
So what are you doing holding on?

Don't you see she's
 rare, precious and she's gone
She's rare, precious and she's gone

She was soft in your hands, now she's shattered your plans
 I'm sympathetic but you've got to understand
You tried to squeeze her somewhere
 she just don't belong
SHe was being sincere when she breathed in your ear
 as long as there were stars in the night sky she'd be near
Even angels get it wrong!

Won't you see she's
 rare, precious and she's gone
She's rare, precious and she's gone

It's a subtle trap
 seeding guilt in her mind
But she ain't taking your crap
 this time
Boy you're out on a line...

She's a queen among women, a child among queens
 the finest thing that your lovesick eyes have ever seen
She's a rose without a thorn
 she's a peach, she's a prize
A gift in disguise
 she's graceful and colourful and when she grows
 she'll be wise
But most of all my friend, she's gone
 gone, gone gone!

She's rare, precious and she's gone
 rare, precious and she's gone
Yes, she's rare, precious and she's gone
 she's rare, precious and she's gone
Gone, gone gone...
