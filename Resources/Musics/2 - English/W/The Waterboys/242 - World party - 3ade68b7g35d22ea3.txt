WORLD PARTY

Well it's got nothing to do with anything that is real
 you just believe in it and it's true
You can sooth like an angel or sigh like a saint
 you can dream it and see it through
You will live to see a sea of lights
 sparking on the face of a pearl
Climb your own peak
 find a new streak

Get yourself along to the world party (party!)

Now you've been building for yourself a cool place in the sand
 you're thinking that it's mighty fine
You've got dust in your eyeballs, you got mud in your mouth
 but it's your head, it ain't mine
I've got a madman of my own to contend with
 cursing in the cave of my skull
Turn the other cheek
 find a new streak

Get yourself along to the world party (party!)

Well I heard a rumour of a golden age
 somewhere back along the line
Maybe I dreamed it in a whisper or
 heard it in a spell
It was something to do with the sign of the times
 and the only thing that I remember
Is a summer like a pretty girl
 who shimmers and shines
Moving in time
 shaking to the beat of the heart of the world

Party (party! party! party! party! party! party! party! party! party!)
