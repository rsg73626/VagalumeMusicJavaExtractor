SPRING COMES TO SPIDDAL

The lights are on in Standun's
 and the spell has been broken
The roadside teahouse door
 is wide open
A sign on the wall
 says "American also spoken"
As Spring comes to Spiddal

The village girls go walking 
 by without their coats
The Irish gaelic college
 is alive again with folk
Farmers gather talking
 freed from Winter's yoke
As Spring comes to Spiddal

A tourist with a telescope
 and a funny looking German bloke
And a billy goat
 all invoke
The Summer soon to bloom

On a soft and fresh Atlantic air
 a mist of pollen floats
On Galway Bay I spy
 a gaily painted fishing boat
There's a rustle around the boreens
 and a song on every throat
As Spring comes
 to Spiddal
