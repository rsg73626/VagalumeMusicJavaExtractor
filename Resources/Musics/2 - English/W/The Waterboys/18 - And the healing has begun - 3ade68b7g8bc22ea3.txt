AND THE HEALING HAS BEGUN

(Van Morrison)

When we walk down the avenue again
 when we walk down the avenue again
When we walk down the avenue again
 when the healing has begun

When we walk down the avenue in style
 when we walk down the avenue, we smile
And we know that it's all going to be worthwhile
 because the healing has begun
 because the healing has begun

I want you to put on your bright red summer dress
 I want you to put on your easter bonnet and Sunday coat and all the rest
And I want to make sweet love to you, yes
 when the healing has begun
 when the healing has begun
