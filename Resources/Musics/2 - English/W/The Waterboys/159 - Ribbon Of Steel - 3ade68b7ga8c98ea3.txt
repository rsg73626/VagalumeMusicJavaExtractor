RIBBON OF STEEL

This is my country
these are my fields
Yes this is my country
and these are my fields
Once the widest river flowed
and the wildest flowers did grow
till we tied up the land
in a ribbon of steel

Bring me my horses
my drums and my wheels
I say bring me my horses
my drums and my wheels
I'm gonna drive them into the sea
the last place on Earth where I still can be free
since we tied up the land
in a ribbon of steel

Now I'm sick and I'm weary
and I long to be healed
I'm sick and I'm weary
and I long to be healed
My spirit is broken and sore
and it ain't got no home in this world anymore
since we tied up the land
in a ribbon of steel
