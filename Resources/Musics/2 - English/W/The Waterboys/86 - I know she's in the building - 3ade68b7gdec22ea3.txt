I KNOW SHE'S IN THE BUILDING

I know she's in the building
 I can feel it in my guts
Somewhere within these four walls
 is the woman that I love
The sweetest wild adventure
 hangs within my grasp
She's eternal, she's alive
 and I've found her at last

I've left her notes and poems
 pinned them on the board
I listen for each step or voice
 that passes by my door
I can feel the raw excitement
 bursting in my chest
I can feel my longing hands
 upon her firm and supple breast

Shifting within my thoughts dance
 inevitably to you, love
I'm enslaved and I'm entranced
 by all you are and do, love

It'll soon be time for dinner
 I know just where's she'll be
But I'll wait here for maybe she
 will come and call on me

She knows the room by number
 she know who waits unseen
King Pan, inflamed with love and joy
 for her, his elfin queen
