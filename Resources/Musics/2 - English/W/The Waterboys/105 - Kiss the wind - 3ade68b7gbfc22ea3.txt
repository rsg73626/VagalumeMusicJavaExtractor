KISS THE WIND

Once upon a time, a time, a time, a time, a time, a time
 I lived here
Once upon a time, a time, a time, a time, a time, a time
 I lived here

I lay my head on a pillow of sky
and I kiss the wind
and heard it sigh

Once upon a time
 I lived here
In the fever of a dream, a dream, a dream, a dream, a dream, a dream
 I loved here
In the fever of a dream, a dream, a dream, a dream, a dream, a dream
 I loved here

Fell, heart and body
 soul and mind
I left all over worlds
 behind
In the fever of a dream
 I loved here

The hour has come, its come, its come, its come, its come, its come, its come, its come
 to leave here
The hour has come, its come, its come, its come, its come, its come, its come, its come
 to leave here

I'll take whatever
 is mine to take
Free my heart before
 it breaks
The hour has come
 to leave here
