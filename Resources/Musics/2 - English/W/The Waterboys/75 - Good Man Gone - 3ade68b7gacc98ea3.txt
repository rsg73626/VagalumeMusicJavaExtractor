GOOD MAN GONE

'm staring at a stranger in the mirror
he's looking like a ghost in human form
that used to be my head
but the occupant has fled
Lord, where's the good man gone ?

My eyes are like two troopers in a foxhole
I'm doing things I used to know were wrong
I've hurt all my friends
and I'll do it again
Lord, where's the good man gone ?

There's a woman, Lord, somewhere in this city
I've got to put her in my song
I'm treating her unkind
and I don't mind
Lord, where's the good man gone
and is he coming back ?
