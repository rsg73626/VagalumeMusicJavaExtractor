THE PAN WITHIN

Come with me
 on a journey beneath the skin
Come with me
 on a journey under the skin
We will look together
 for the Pan within

Close your eyes
 breathe slow we'll begin
Close your eyes
 breathe slow and we will begin
To look together
 for the Pan within
 
swing your hips
 loose your head, and let it spin
Swing your hips
 loose you head, and let it spin
And we will look together
 for the Pan within

Close your eyes
 breathe slow and we will begin
Close your eyes
 breathe slow and we will begin
To look together
 for the Pan within

Put your face in my window
 breathe a night full of treasures
The wind is delicious
 sweet and wild with the promise of pleasure
The stars are alive
 and nights like these
Were born to be
 sanctified by you and me
Lovers, thieves, fools and pretenders
 and all we gotta do is surrender

Come with me
 on a journey under the skin
Come with me
 on a journey under the skin
And we will look together
 for the Pan within
When to be with you
 is not a sin
When to be with you, oh just to be with you
 is not a sin
We will look together
 for the Pan within
