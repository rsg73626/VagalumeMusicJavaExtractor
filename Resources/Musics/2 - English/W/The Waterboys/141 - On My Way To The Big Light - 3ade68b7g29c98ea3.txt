ON MY WAY TO THE BIG LIGHT

I fired an arrow made out of will
and watched as it flew beyond a green hill
I followed its trail with a song in my head,
the stars for my cieling, the earth for my bed

On my way to the big Light
On my way to the big Light

My thoughts exploded like flowers in May
With the eye of my mind I saw a great day
I climbed a dark tower, took it by stealth
With every idea I invented myself

On my way to the big Light
On my way to the big Light

In a hungry hour in an unlit land,
heard by no ear I made my demands
The tables were cleared and the ashes were swept
Rome was rebuilt in a day as I slept

On my way to the big Light
On my way to the big Light

I can still see the bones of the ships of the sun
in the slow ebbing tide when the battle was won
Afraid of nothing, scared of no man
I did not die and I know who I Am

On my way to the big Light
On my way to the big Light

And no son of Adam, no daughter of Eve
will be able to stop me when I'm ready to leave

All love to the Love
All flame to the Fire
All wings to the Wind
All that lives - Higher !
