THE RAGGLE TAGGLE GYPSY

(Traditional)

There were three old gypsies came to our hall door
 they came brave and boldly-o
And one sang high and the other sang low
 and the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o

It was upstairs downstairs the lady went
 put on her suit of leather-o
And there was a cry from around the door
 she's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o

It was late that night when the Lord came in
 enquiring for his lady-o
And the servant girl she said to the Lord
 "She's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o"

"Then saddle for me my milk white steed
 - my big horse is not speedy-o
And I will ride till I seek my bride
 she's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o"

Now he rode East and he rode West
 he rode North and South also
Until he came to a wide open plain
 it was there that he spied his lady-o

"How could you leave your goose feather bed
 your blankeys strewn so comely-o?
And how could you leave your newly wedded Lord
 all for a raggle taggle gypsy-o?"

"What care I for my goose feather bed
 wi' blankets strewn so comely-o?
Tonight I lie in a wide open field
 in the arms of a raggle taggle gypsy-o"

"How could you leave your house and your land?
 how could you leave your money-o?
How could you leave your only wedded Lord
 all for a raggle taggle gypsy-o?"

"What care I for my house and my land?
 what care I for my money-o?
I'd rather have a kiss from the yellow gypsy's lips
 I'm away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o!"
