SUNNY SAILOR BOY

On a day of days
I stood and gazed
over the western sea
I was completely dazed
wide-mouthed and amazed
when a mermaid called to me 

Oh-wo-oh-wo-oh
Oh-wo-oh-wo-oh-wo
My sunny sailor boy

Like a man in a dream
for an age it seemed
I stood as still as a stone
while the creature sang
and her melody rang
like a memory calling me home

Oh-wo-oh-wo-oh
Oh-wo-oh-wo-oh-wo
My sunny sailor boy
