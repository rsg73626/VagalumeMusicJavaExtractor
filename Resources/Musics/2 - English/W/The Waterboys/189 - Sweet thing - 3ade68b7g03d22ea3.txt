SWEET THING

(Van Morrison, John Lennon)

And I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first
and I will drink the clear clean water for to quench my thirst 
And I shall watch the ferry-boats and they'll get high 
 against a blue ocean, against tomorrow's sky 

And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
 and I will never ever ever get so old again
Oh sweet thing, yeah yeah yeah... sweet thing 
 my, my, my, my, my sweet thing 

And I shall drive my chariot down your streets and cry
 "Hey, it's me! I'm dynamite and I don't know why"
And you will take me warm in your arms again
 and I will not remember that I ever felt the pain

And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
 and never ever ever ever ever get so old again

Ooh
 sweet thing
Yeah yeah yeah...
 sweet thing
My my my...

And I will raise my hand up into the night time sky
 and count the stars there shining in your eyes
Just to dig it all an' not to wonder, that's just fine...
 and I'll be satisfied not to read in between the lines

And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
 and never ever ever ever ever ever ever get so old again

Ooh
 sweet thing
Yeah yeah yeah...
 sweet thing

Sugar-baby, sugar-baby, sugar-baby,  
with your saint-like smile
and your beautiful mind
and your champagne eyes

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
 blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take this broken wing and learn to fly
 all your life you were only waiting for this moment to arrive
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
 take your sunken eyes, learn to see
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free...
you were only waiting for this moment to be free...
you were only waiting for this moment to be free...
you were only waiting for this moment to be free...
you were only waiting for this moment to be free...
