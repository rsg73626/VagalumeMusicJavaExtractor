I'M SO LONESOME I COULD CRY

Well, do you hear that lonesome ?? ??
 Lord, he sounds too blue to cry
The midnight train lord he's ?? and ??
 and I'm so lonesome I could cry

Well if you ever hear a robin weep
 when the leaves begin to die
Likely he's lost the will to live
 and I'm so lonesome I could cry

Now the silence of the falling star
 it lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder sweetheart where you are
 I'm so lonesome I could cry

Now the train that I ride is sixteen coaches long
 and the girl that I love is gone
and if I could grow wings, I would take off and fly
 I'm lonesome I could cry
 yes, I'm lonesome I could cry
