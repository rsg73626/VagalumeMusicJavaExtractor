THAT'S NOT ENOUGH

You give me everything
 you give me your best
You take two steps forward
 and put me to the test
You talk to your mother
 who give you good advice
You send me cards with your best wishes
 and I'm sure that's very nice but
 
That's not enough
 oh no, that's not enough
You're not enough and that's
 not enough for me
 
I don't want to be cruel
 I wouldn't want to be unkind
But how do I tell you that when you
 speak to me you just waste your time
I'll never carry
 someone who doesn't care
You give me everything you think you can but
 your heart isn't really there
 
And that's not enough
 oh no, that's not enough
You're not enough and that's
 not enough for me
