I'VE BEEN IN THE STORM FOR YOU

I've been in the storm for you
 when my horn for you
 was reborn for you
I handled a thorn for you
 I was torn for you
 I was born for you
And here you go leaving me
 decieving me
 and its greiving me

I've been in the storm for you
 I've performed you you
 I was spawned for you
So why can't you love
 so why can't you love

I've changed what I wear for you
 and my hair for you
 I've said prayers for you
I gave up my share for you
 I went bare for you
 and i cared for you
And here you go blaming me
 shaming me
 defaming me

I've been in the storm for you
 I was shorn for you
 and reborn for you
So why can't you love
 so why can't you love
 so why can't you love
And why don't you know
 aww, don't you know
What will happen
 what will happen if you do
