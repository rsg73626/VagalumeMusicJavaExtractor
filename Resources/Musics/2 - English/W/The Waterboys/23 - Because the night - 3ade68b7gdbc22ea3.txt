BECAUSE THE NIGHT

Take me now, baby
 here as I am
Hold me close
 try and understand
The sirens' hunger
 is the fire I breathe
Love is the banquet
 on which we feed

Come on now
 try and understand
The way I feel
 when I'm in your hands
Take my hand
 as the sun descends
You can't touch me now
 can't touch me now
Can't touch me now...

Because the night belongs to lovers
 because the night belongs to love
Because the night belongs to lovers
 because the night belongs to love
If we believe in the fact we're lovers
 if we believe in the fact we're trust
If we believe in the fact we're lovers
 because the night belongs to love
