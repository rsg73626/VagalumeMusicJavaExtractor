CALLING BACK MY SPIRIT

Something has been sleeping in me, weeping in me, creeping in me
 Something has been crying in me, sighing in me, dying in me
In the righting of this wrong, I may have to fight a long awaited duel
 I'm calling back my spirit from you, IæŠ¦ calling back what is my own.

Something has been burning in me, churning in me, turning in me
 Something has been weeping in me, creeping in me, awaking in me
And in the execution of this task, I may come to see my enemy's mask
 slip and fall

I'm calling back my spirit from you, I'm calling back what my own
I'm calling back, I'm calling back,
 I'm calling back my spirit from you, I'm calling back what is my own

The storm of your outrage seethes and whips around my brittle bones
 anger and violence erupt from your lips and your cover is blown!
I seek the sound of your name
 I stand in my own footsteps and I claim my power

I'm calling back my spirit from you, I'm calling back what is my own
I'm calling back, I'm calling back, I'm calling back, IæŠ¦ calling back, 
 I'm calling back my spirit from you now!, I'm calling back what is my own
