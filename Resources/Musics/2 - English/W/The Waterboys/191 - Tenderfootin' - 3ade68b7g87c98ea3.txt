TENDERFOOTIN'

You're tenderfootin' baby
you're tenderfootin' baby
you're tenderfootin' baby
when you should be ballin' around
You're tenderfootin' baby you got your tender feet
flat back on the ground

Yeah, you're tenderfootin' baby
places that you don't belong
You're tenderfootin' baby, baby, baby
places that you don't belong
You better run baby
when you hear this song

You're tenderfootin' baby
doin' things somebody like you ought not to do
You're tenderfootin' baby
doin' things mama never told you to
I'd be on the train baby if I was you !

You're tenderfootin' baby
turnin' the lights down low
In the morning someone will be leanin' over you
and sayin' I told you so
because you will be hurt
by what you don't know
