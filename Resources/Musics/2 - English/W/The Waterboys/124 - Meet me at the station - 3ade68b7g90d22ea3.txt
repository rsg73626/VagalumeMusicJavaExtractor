MEET ME AT THE STATION

(Brother William's Memphis Sanctified Singers)

Well if I get to heaven before you do
 I will meet you at the station when your train comes along
I'll be watching and waiting, Mother dear, for you
 I will meet you at the station when your train comes along

Father, when the train 
 father, when the train
Meet me at the station when the train comes along
 when the train
Father, when the train comes along
 I will meet you at the station when your train comes along

Well if my eyes see the glory, before yours do
 I will meet you at the station when your train comes along
I'll be watching and waiting, Father, for you
 I will meet you at the station whe your train comes along

Father, when the train 
 father, when the train
Meet me at the station when the train comes along
 father, when the train 
Father, when the train comes along
 I will meet you at the station when your train comes along

Now if my feet touch the homeline before yours do
 I will meet you at the station when the train comes along
I'll be watching and waiting, my brother, for you
 I will meet you at the station when the train comes along

When the train 
 when the train
Meet me at the station when the train comes along
 when the train 
When the train comes along
 meet me at the station when the train comes along

When the train 
 when the train
Meet me at the station when the train comes along
 when the train 
When the train comes along
 meet me at the station when the train comes along

Now if you see God's country before I do
 Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along
Will you be there watching, sister, for me
 will you meet me at the station when my train comes along

When my train
 when my train
Meet me at the station when my train comes along
 when my train 
Sister, when my train comes along
 Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along

When the train 
 when the train
Meet me at the station when my train comes along
 when the train 
Oh, when the train
 meet me at the station when the train comes along
 meet me at the station when the train comes along
 meet me at the station when the train comes along
