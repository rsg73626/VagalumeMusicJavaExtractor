GOING BACK TO LOVE

One fine day
I'm going back to Love
I'm going back to where I'm from,
where I belong
Yes I am

One fine day
I'm going back to Love
I'm going back to the High Land
where I began
Yes I am

And on that day
I'm gonna take my place
I'm gonna tell the news
of how I made it through

And in that hour
I'm gonna claim my power
I'm gonna shine and stand
in who I really Am

One fine day
I'm going back to Love
I'm going back to where I'm from
where I belong
Yes I am

One fine day
I'm going back to Love
I'm going back to the High Land
where I began
Yes I am !
