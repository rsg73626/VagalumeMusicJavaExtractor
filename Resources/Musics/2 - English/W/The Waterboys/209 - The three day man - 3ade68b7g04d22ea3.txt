THE THREE DAY MAN

I'm the three day man
 it's three days too long
Everything is in its right place but
 something is wrong
Time is on wheels
 and my legs shake
I have to live with every decision
 that you make

And that doesn't mean
 that I'll be your slave
It doesn't mean you're here to stay
 it doesn't mean we're friends for life
You know I want you
 you know that I love you
But I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway

Sixes and sevens
 oh how it rains
Sleep is a station
 life is a train
People snatch instinctively for
 whatever crutch they need
But I promise not to abuse you
 if you don't love me leave

And that means
 that I'll be never your slave
It means that you're not here to stay
 means that we're not friends for life
You know how I want you
 you know that I love you
But I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
 never need you anyway

And that means
 that I'll be never your slave
It means you're not here to stay
 means we're not friends for life
You know how I want you
 you know that I love you

But I'll never need you anyway
 I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
 never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
 I'll never need you!
