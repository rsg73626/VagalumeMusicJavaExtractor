ONE SWEET STEP AT A TIME

The mountain sure is steep
and the road beneath my feet
is the toughest thing I have ever climbed
But I know I will succeed
I will find all the strength I need
if I take it one sweet step at a time

Just one sweet step at a time
One sweet step at a time
It's-a gonna be a mighty long way still
but I'll make it, yes I will
One sweet step at a time
