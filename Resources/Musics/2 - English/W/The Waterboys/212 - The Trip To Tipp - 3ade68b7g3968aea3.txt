THE TRIP TO TIPP

We've all come down to Thurles
armed with tent-poles and guitars
to have the craic and ceili
underneath the summer stars
We're up from Cork and Kerry
and we're down from Donegal
from every end of Ireland
for the Feile one and all

From every end of Ireland
we're here to let it rip
to go kissin', drinkin', smokin', dancin',
trippin' down in Tipp

There's Paddies, Eileens, Bridies, Fergals,
Dympnas, Seans and Tims
O'Kelly's, Cooneys, Mooneys, Murphys,
Morans and McGinns
And if you close your eyes and listen
you can hear the legends sing ;
the ghosts of Nicky Rackard,
Jimmy Doyle and Christy Ring

From every end of Ireland
we're here to let it rip
to go kissin', drinkin', smokin', dancin',
trippin' down in Tipp

We'll cheer yer man Costello
'cause he's such a dacent bloke
and we'll laugh with ould Van morrison
when he tells us all a joke
We'll waltz with Nanci Griffiths
and we'll pogo with The Pogues
We'll freak-out with The Wonderstuff
and then we'll all take off our clothes 

From every end of Ireland
we're here to let it rip
to go kissin', drinkin', smokin', dancin',
trippin' down in Tipp

When all the music's over
and all the bands have gone
and silence comes a-creepin'
in the Tipperary dawn
I'll make a solemn promise
and I'll whisper it to you
I'll meet you at The Trip To Tipp
in nineteen ninety two !

From every end of Ireland
we're here to let it rip
to go kissin', drinkin', smokin', dancin',
trippin' down in Tipp
