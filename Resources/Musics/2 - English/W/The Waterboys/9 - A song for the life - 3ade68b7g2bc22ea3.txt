A SONG FOR THE LIFE

(Rodney Crowell)

I don't drink as much as I used to 
 'cos lately that just ain't my style. 
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought'a 
 they pass quickly like when I was a child. 

And lately I've learnt how to listen 
 to a sound like the sun going down 
In the magic that morning is bringing 
 there's a song for the life I have found 

It keeps my feet on the ground

Now the midsummer days ain't so heady 
 they just drift like a breeze through my mind. 
And nothing appears in a hurry 
 as if to make up for some old long-lost time 

And lately I've learnt how to listen 
 to a sound like the sun going down 
In the magic that morning is bringing 
 there's a song for the friends I have found 

They keep my feet on the ground... 
They keep my feet on the ground... 
They keep my feet on the ground
