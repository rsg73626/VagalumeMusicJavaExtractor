SUNRISING

I'm a child in the guise of a man
I'm a man in the hands of a child
and I'm driving as hard as I can
just trying to make up some miles
I've been out on this road so long
my edges are starting to curl
but I'll sleep when the first flush of Dawn
softens the rim of the world

After all this time I'm still on the line
with a case to prove and a public to move
After all my turning this fire is still burning
and I'm back on show
with a mile to go
with one more mile to go

Her fire was a fire of rage
Under her skin it spread
It festered and blew for an age
then burst from the coils of her head
She cast up a tower of tears
but beauty broke it back down
I stared at the wreck for years
then woke up one day and found

After all this time I'm still on the line
with a case to prove and a public to move
After all my turning this fire is still burning
and I'm back on show
with a mile to go
with one more mile to go...

Step on the gas and kiss the wind
over the pass and peel that skin away
Follow the lover out and in
some other Lover coming in to stay
I never meant to go to sea
I always meant the sea to come to me

I'm a child in the guise of a man
I'm a man in the hands of a child
and my Lover is in the Hands
that carry me over the miles
My Lover is in the car
My Lover is in the road
My Lover is in the stars
that melt as the Dawn explodes

And my Lover is in the wind
blowing down the line 'tween your heart and mine
And my Lover is in the Voice
that whispers clear
in my guts and ear
even when I do not hear
