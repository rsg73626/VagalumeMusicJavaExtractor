BARELY OUT OF TEENAGE

Where'd you get that jacket
 did it fall, off a lorry
Where'd you get those lines
 on your forehead, was it worry
I remember you ??? 1976
Did you get a good part exchange
On security for kicks

Where did you get that family?
 Where did you get that mortgage?
 Where did you get that family?
Man you're barely out of teenage
 man you're barely out of teenage

Don't cock up or cop out
 because love shouldn't bring a man to ruin
You're walking living breathing proof
 that you don't know what you're doing
Fun is fun when you're in control
 but there's a line that has to be drawn
Don't play with guns until you learn how to fire
 the safety catch may not be on

Where did you get that family?
 Where did you get that mortgage?
 Where did you get that family?
Man you're barely out of teenage
 man you're barely out of teenage
