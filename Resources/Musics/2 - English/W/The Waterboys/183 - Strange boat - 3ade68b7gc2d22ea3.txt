STRANGE BOAT

We're sailing on a strange boat
 heading for a strange shore
We're sailing on a strange boat
 heading for a strange shore
Carrying the strangest cargo
 that was ever hauled aboard

We're sailing on a strange sea
 blown by a strange wind
We're sailing on a strange sea
 blown by a strange wind
Carrying the strangest crew
 that ever sinned

We're riding in a strange car
 we're followin' a strange star
We're climbing on the strangest ladder
 that was ever there to climb

We're living in a strange time
 working for a strange goal
We're living in a strange time
 working for a strange goal
We're turning flesh and body
 into soul
