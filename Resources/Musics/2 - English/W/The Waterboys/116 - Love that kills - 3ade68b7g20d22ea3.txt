LOVE THAT KILLS

Will you take me slowly
will you lead me all the way
Will you sing me your songs
until I am ready for
The LOVE that kills
yeah!

I have known you in the
sheets and folds of many lifetimes
You were there when I was made
and I will speak to you in the language of dream until
Love comes my way
love that kills
yeah!

Hey I will ride on a dolphin, rain in my face, 
wind in all of my sails
There's a shadow hard on my heels now, 
but I'm still trying to, I'm still trying to...
Get to the place, where rolling rivers overspill
I have come a long way and I need my cup refilled

So when you come for me slowly
when you come knocking on my door
When the soul sings
and the man is still
I will be ready
I will be ready
Yes I will be ready for the love that kills
yeah!

The love that kills
the love that kills, Kills, kills
the love that kills
