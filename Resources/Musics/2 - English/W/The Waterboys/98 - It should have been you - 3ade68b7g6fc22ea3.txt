IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU

Can I believe my ears?
 is this really you?
Pacing the floor with one eye on the door
 watching the winners go through
Why do you hang back now?
 why d'you hesitate?
You fires don't burn
 for he who waits

Out of all of the people
 that I ever knew
If one should have made it
 it should have been you!

I know who I'm looking for
 but I don't believe my eyes
The sight of you with your head hung low
 is a sick, sad suprise
Why do you hang back now?
 why d'you hesitate?
How dare you throw it all away then tell me
 aw man it must be fate

Out of all of the people
 that I ever knew
There had to one I could believe in
 and it should have been you!

A gift that dies is a tragic thing
 and it happens all the time
But a gift that's wasted, thrown to hell is the
 worst of stupid crimes!
I saw you hang back now!
 I watched you hesitate!
You're a well respected man, but bullshit!
 you could've been great!

Out of all the people
 I ever knew
There should have been one
 and it should have been you!

I spent my whole life
 looking for someone like you!
