ONE OF MANY RESCUERS

I've heard this script before, I know this turn of mind
 you think that you're the one to bring the change she's trying to find
But what you're selling, she don't need -- she already got it free
 your boat struck something deep, now you're trying to save the sea

You ain't Sir Galahad, she ain't your blushing bride
 you ain't the wayward son, come back to turn the tide
You ain't the savior king, foretold and prophecied
 you're just one of many rescuers, trying to get by her side

She put her hand around the flame more times than you can tell
 the best thing you could do for her is to pass and wish her well
She ain't dying on her feet, nor hanging on your every word
 the pain your sensing is inside you -- you're just thinking it onto her

You ain't Sir Galahad, she ain't your blushing bride
 you ain't the wayward son, come back to turn the tide
You ain't the savior king, foretold and prophecied
 you're just one of many rescuers, trying to get by her side

I've heard your presentation and it's time for me to go
 the train is waiting at the railway station and there's much that we don't know
I've a secret in my keep and I'll tell you if you ask
 but I know that you can't really speak, till you remove the mask

Now I can see you're using all you've got, all the power that's in your hands
 you're pulling favours, casting 'em up, money flies at your command
You talk hard but you don't listen, you look long but you don't see
 but what bothers me most about you my friend, you remind me too much of me

You ain't Sir Galahad, she ain't your blushing bride
 you ain't the wayward son, come back to turn the tide
You ain't the savior king, foretold and prophecied
 you're just one of many rescuers, trying to get by her side
