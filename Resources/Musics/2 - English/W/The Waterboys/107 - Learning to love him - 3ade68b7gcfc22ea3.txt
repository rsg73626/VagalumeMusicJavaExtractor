LEARNING TO LOVE HIM

I'm learning to love him
 to love and forgive
I'm learning to trust him
 to let the man live
I'm learning to see him
 to see who he is
I'm learning to love
 the beauty he is

I'm learning to love him
 to love and forgive
I'm learning to trust him
 to let the man live
I'm learning to hold
 his life in my hands
I'm learning to love
 me just as I am
