THE LADDER

Once in my lifetime I intend to see
the Ladder ascending in front of me

I've been searching without
I've been searchin within
Up, down, all around, roundabout
here and there, out and in

Because once in my lifetime I intend to see
the Ladder ascending in front of me

I have a come a long way
over oceans and hills
I'm weary and unwhole
and I need my cup refilled

Once in my lifetime I intend to see
the Ladder ascending in front of me
