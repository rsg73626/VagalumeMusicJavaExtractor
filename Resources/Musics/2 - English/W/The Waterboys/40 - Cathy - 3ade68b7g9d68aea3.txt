CATHY

Cathy so crazy 'bout all the latest fashions
sits in her empty room staring at the wall
she lives in a castle somewhere in the mountains
oh I wish that she was in love with me
in love with me

Watch her as she looks up from the pages of her paper
She tosses her head and slowly looks away
pours another measure from her half empty bottle
Oh I wish that she was in love with me
in love with me

Oh I wish that she was in love with me

Slowly she pours herself another picture
sinks down into her oldest saxon chair
looks up and crosses her heart out with all the debris
Oh I wish that she was in love with me
in love with me !
