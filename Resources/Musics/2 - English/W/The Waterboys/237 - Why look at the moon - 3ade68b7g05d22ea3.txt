WHY LOOK AT THE MOON

Willows were swaying
The water was rippling
The froggies were singing
Along with the laughing at the bank

We have the moon to thank
For this lovely scene
We might never have seen
If it hadn't have been for the moon

Why, look at that moon
Away up high, seeing everything
That goes by
Why, look at that moon
Why, why, why, look at the moon
Why, why, why, look at the moon

Sitting in the desert
Beneath a lonesome sky
Cool, my oh my, it would be

If it never been above
That fateful little boy
That one who has beheld true love through history

Why must it start?
Why must lovers part?
Why does the cheatin' go on?
Why have hearts turned to stone?

Why, look at that moon
Away up high, seeing everything
That goes by
Why, look at that moon
Why, why, why, look at the moon
Why, why, why, look at the moon

Why, look at that moon
Ain't it grand!
Why, look at that moon
Helps me understand
Why, look at that moon
Inspirator of many a dream
Why, look at that moon
