WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

I've tried to do things my own way
and I've tried to do what people say
and I'm going nowhere fast
and I'm turning to you at last

What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do Lord ?

I can see the lights of home
but I can't get there on my own
I can see the landing slip
but I need you to steer my ship

What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do Lord ?

I've been a fool and I've been a clown
I let the enemy turn me around
I've wasted love and I've wasted time
I've been proud and I've been blind

I've got a lot of things to change
a whole man to re-arrange
but if you'll show me how
I'll begin right now

What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do Lord ?
What do you want me to do Lord ?

I'm listening...
