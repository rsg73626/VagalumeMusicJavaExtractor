PERSONAL

It's not personal
 you didn't let me down at all
No, it's not personal
 it's how the world goes 'round, is all

I've got some loving but it ain't for sale
 - give it free to you, my friend
Somewhere further down the trail
 I'l be pulling out again

It's not personal
 don't let it underneath your skin
No, it's not personal
 I'm only breathing out and in

I'm just moving on
 because the groove has gone
I'm just stealing down the line
 and it's fine

Woke up this morning, I was all alone
 instead of her I found a note
I guess my bluebird just came home
 for these are all the words she wrote...

It's not personal
 you didn't let me down at all
No, it's not personal
 it's how the world goes 'round is all
 it's how the world goes 'round
