TRUMPETS

Your love feels
 like trumpets sound
I said your love feels
 like trumpets sound
Your life is like a mountain
 yes, your life is like a mountain
 and your heart is like a church
With wide open doors
 and to be with you
Is to find myself in the best of dreams
 your love feels like trumpets
 
Your love feels
 like high summer
Your love feels
 like high, high, summer
Your life is like an ocean
 yes, your life is like an ocean
 I want to dive in naked
Lose myself in your depths
 I want to be with you
To find myself in the best of dreams
 Your love feels like trumpets
 
Please don't wake me
 no don't shake me
I want to be with you
 when being with you is the same
The same as being you
 your love feels like trumpets
