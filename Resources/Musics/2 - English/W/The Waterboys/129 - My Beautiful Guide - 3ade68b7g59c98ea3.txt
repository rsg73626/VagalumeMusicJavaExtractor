MY BEAUTIFUL GUIDE

When the sound of the crowd gets too damn loud
and the pain all around starts pulling me down
and doubt and distress put my faith to the test
I take a deep breath
and I turn inside
to my Beautiful Guide

When the voices of fear are churning in my ear
and the tricks of my mind are making me blind
and an old foe arrives in a brand new disguise
I close my eyes
and confide
in my Beautiful Guide

He's right here, right now
even as I sing
How did I find Him ?
By turning within

When I'm in the dark night and I can't find a light
and the outlook is grim and the chances are slim
and I've played my last throw and I've tried all I know
I let it go...
and He decides
my Beautiful Guide
