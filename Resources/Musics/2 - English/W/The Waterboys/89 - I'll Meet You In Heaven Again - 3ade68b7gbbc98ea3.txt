I'LL MEET YOU IN HEAVEN AGAIN

Although we are parted
and our loved ones are brokenhearted
and a chapter ends
I'll keep your picture near
I'll keep your memory dear
and I'll meet you in heaven again

All the secrets we keep
all the words we don't speak
things that's hard to say between two men
but like the meeting of two rivers
all will be delivered
when I meet you in heaven again

Some say it's over - as if there is no more
but death is not an ending - death is but a door
Some call it the end of the road - but they've got it all wrong
the end is a beginning
and the road is long

So I'll work as hard as I can
I will use my heart and my hands
I won't waste a single day he sends
And when it's gone
on that golden Dawn
I will meet you in heaven again
