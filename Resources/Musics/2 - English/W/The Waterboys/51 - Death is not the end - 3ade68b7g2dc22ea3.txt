DEATH IS NOT THE END

(Bob Dylan)

When you are sad and you are lonesome
 and you just can't find a friend
Just remember
 death is not the end

And when all that you've held sacred
 falls down and does not mend
Just remember
 death is not the end

Not the end
 no, not the end
Just remember
 death is not the end

Now, when you're standing at a crossroads
 that you cannot comprehend
Just remember
 death is not the end

And when all your dreams have vanished
 and you don't know what's around the bend
Just remember
 death is not the end

Not the end
 no, not the end
Just remember
 death is not the end

The tree of life is growing
 where the spirit never dies
And the bright lights of salvation shine
 in dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire
 with the burning flesh of men
Just remember
 death is not the end

Not the end
 no, not the end
Just remember
 death is not the end

Now when the rain-clouds gather around you
 and the heavy rain descends
Just remember
 death is not the end

And if nobody is close beside you
 with a soulful hands to lend
Just remember
 death is not the end

Not the end
 no, not the end
Just remember
 death is not the end

Not the end
 no, not the end
Just remember
 death is not the end
