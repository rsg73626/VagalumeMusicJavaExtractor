EVER TO BE NEAR YE

Ever to be near ye
where you bide or where you stray
to comfort and to cheer ye
be your fortune what it may
Hearken now and hear ye :
I'd be happy night and day
ever to be near ye
Happy I'd be night and day
ever to be near ye

Ever to be near ye
neither rocks nor current rife
ever need to fear ye
from the stress or from the strife
Couthily I'll steer ye
through the stormy sea of life
Ever to be near ye
through the stormy sea of life
ever to be near ye

Ever to be near ye
good and bonnie as ye are
who could not revere ye ?
In your circle or afar
none there is to peer ye !
Oh, for better or for worse
ever to be near ye
Oh, for better or for worse
ever to be near ye
