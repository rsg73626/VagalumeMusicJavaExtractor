GOING BACK TO GLASTERS

I first played the pyramid stage
 back in 1984
(Karl and Kev, Barv on bass
/
Karl on keys, Kev on drums)
 and Anto man made four

I stayed up all night wide awake
 wearing a mile-wide grin
Diggin' the transient city
 and all that grooved within

Played a storm in '86
 felt like we were the kings
Fiddle bows and mandolins
 sure broke a lot of strings

We played "Purple Rain", "Medicine Bow"
 and "The Healing has Begun"
I climbed the tor at the break of dawn
 just to salute the sun

And I'm goin' back to Glasters walkin' tall
 Yes I'm goin' back to Glasters walkin' tall, walkin' tall
I'm goin' back to Glasters, I can't go any faster
 I'm goin' back to Glasters, that's all

The next time was '89
 with the raggle-taggle band
We were jammin' jigs and reels
 in a backstage transit van

I wore a wedding suit
 I sang "When you go away"
Sharon Shannon's accordion
 was the soundtrack of the day

And I'm goin' back to Glasters walkin' tall
 Yes I'm goin' back to Glasters walkin' tall, walkin' tall
I'm goin' back to Glasters, I can't go any faster
 I'm goin' back to Glasters, that's all

Five years later I returned
 a different man of course
I guested with the boy McNabb
 and the mighty Crazy Horse

I cranked up the red Les Paul
 and I let the bastard rip
I'm coming back this year for sure,
 I might even be hip

And I'm goin' back to Glasters walkin' tall
 Yes I'm goin' back to Glasters walkin' tall, walkin' tall
I'm goin' back to Glasters, I can't go any faster
 I'm goin' back to Glasters, that's all
