YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANTS

I saw her today at the reception
she had a glass of wine in her hand
She is practiced in the art of deception
and her feet ne'er touched the ground
You can't always get what you want
you can't always get what you want!
You can't always get what you want!
you can't always get what you want!

But if you try some time
you just might find
You know what you need!

Well, I went down to the demonstration
to get my fair share of the views
I was standing there next to Mr. Jagger
the man did a-look pretty confused
He said "you can't always get what you want!"
no, you can't always get what you want!
Indeed, you can't always get what you want!

But if you try some time
you just might find
You get what you need!
