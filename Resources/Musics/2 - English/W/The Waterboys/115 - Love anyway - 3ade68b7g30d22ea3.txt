LOVE ANYWAY

So you crahed the plane
 and there's hell to pay
I'm making it plain
 I love you anyway

You made a fool
 out of me today
I'm breaking the rule
I love you anyway

You threw the blame
 what a role to play!
My story's the same
 I love you anyway

You dealt the blow
 and you burst the ball
I'm letting you know
 I love you most of all

Magic we chase - only to find
 it comes from a place higher than mind
Higher than dust, but only just
 it hangs on the cusp

I can hear you scream
 like a branded slave
It's only a dream
 I love you anyway

You've got a war to wage
 chief to obey
Foe to engage
 I love you anyway

You hunker down
 feeling small
Judging the clown
 I love you most of all

I picture you with the eye of my mind
 a portrait in blue, unravaged by time
Beauty undimmed and through your pale skin
 the beauty within

So you beat the child
 sent him away
Beauty defiled
 I love you anyway

You tricked the King
 cut him where he lay
Unthinkable thing
 I love you anyway

You held the jewel
 and you let it fall
Prince of a fool!
 I love you most of all

Over the wind, under the hill
 wing upon wing, love over will
When the big me meets the big you
 the things we will do!

I'll make the time
 if you name the day
Trouble or shine
 I love you anyway

I think of you
 as child of clay
Whatever you do
 I love yo anyway
