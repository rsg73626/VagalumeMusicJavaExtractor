DANCING BAREFOOT

(Patti Smith)

She is benediction 
 she is addicted to thee 
She is the root connection 
 she is connecting with he 

Here I go and I don't know why 
I fell so ceaselessly 
Could it be he's taking over me... 

I'm dancing barefoot
 heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
 makes me come on like some heroin

She is sublimation 
 she is the essence of thee 
She is concentrating on 
 he, who is chosen by she 

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly,
Could it be he's taking over me...

I'm dancing barefoot
 heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
 makes me come on like some heroin

She is recreation 
 she, intoxicated by thee 
She has the slow sensation that 
 he is levitating with she ... 

Here I go and I don't know why, 
 I spin so ceaselessly, 
'Til I lose my sense of gravity... 

I'm dancing barefoot 
 heading for a spin 
Some strange music draws me in 
 makes me come on like some heroin
