ANOTHER KIND OF CIRCUS

Billy and Eve
are getting ready to leave
their empty room
and their sad bare walls
They'll get burned but they don't care
they know what they'll do when they get there

Rose and Trudi
are hearing voices
telling them it's high time
high time they made their move
They'll get burned but they don't care
they know what they'll do when they get there

Me and Ruthy
we're late again
but our hearts are in
the right direction
We've been up together most of the night
convincing each other what we're doing is right
No sense in living something you don't believe
so we're all ready to leave
all moving on
to another kind of circus
