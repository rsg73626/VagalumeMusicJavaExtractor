ALWAYS DANCING, NEVER GETTING TIRED

i've climbed high with you
i've run dry with you
i've climbed high with you
i've run dry with you
how did i find you ?
how did i lose you ?
how did i find you ?
how did i lose you ?

always dancing, always dancing
never ever getting tired
always dancing, always dancing
never ever getting tired

millions of people
every one like you
millions of people
every one like you
i feel you move me
in such sweet silence
i feel you move me
in such sweet silence

always dancing, always dancing
never ever getting tired
always dancing, always dancing
never getting getting tired

i don't know where i
get all my tears from
i don't know where i
get all my tears from
i don't know where i
get all my tears from
i don't know where i
get all my tears from

always dancing, always dancing
never ever getting tired
always dancing, always dancing
never ever getting tired

underneath are the everlasting arms
