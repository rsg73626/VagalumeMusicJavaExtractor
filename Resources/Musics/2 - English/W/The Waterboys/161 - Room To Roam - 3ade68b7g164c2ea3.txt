ROOM TO ROAM

You go yours
and I'll go mine
the many ways we'll wend
Many days
and many ways
ending in one end

Many a wrong and its curing song
many a road and many an inn
Room to roam but only one home
for all the world to win

So you go yours
and I'll go mine
and the many many ways we'll wend
Many days and many ways
ending in one end
