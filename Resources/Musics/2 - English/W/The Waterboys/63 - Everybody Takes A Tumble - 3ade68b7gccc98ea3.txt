EVERYBODY TAKES A TUMBLE

To break your heart into rubble
is what I'm here to do
I've got nothing but trouble, babe
in store for you
I've got one eye fixed on the main chance
one hand behind your back
and you just stumbled blind, babe
right into my track

And that's when you fell so low
Everybody takes a tumble, don't you know ?
That's when you fell so low
Pick yourself off the floor before you go

There's vengeance in my belly
slime on both my shoes
and everything bad that you ever heard
about little old me is true
My trigger finger is itchy
my humour is black
and you just stumbled blind, babe
right into my track

And that's when you fell so low
Everybody takes a tumble, don't you know ?
That's when you fell so low
Pick yourself off the floor before you go

Now the devil drives a hard bargain
preacher burns his hands
fireman makes a sermon
lord surveys his lands
Huck Finn just went out for sticks
he ain't coming back
and you just stumbled blind babe
right into my track

And that's when you fell so low
Everybody takes a tumble, don't you know ?
That's when you fell so low
Pick yourself off the floor before you go

Faces start-a shining
flags begin to sway
Would you believe I came a long distance
to be with you today
Your crooked partner
he just got the sack
and you just stumbled blind babe
right into my track

And that's when you fell so low
Everybody takes a tumble, don't you know ?
That's when you fell so low
Pick yourself off the floor before you go
