THE LION OF LOVE

Calling down the lion of love
 use me
Calling down the lion of love
 use me

So much to say
 so much to time and space
I said it load and clear
 plot and make my case
I put it into rhythm
 sculpt it into rhyme
wrap my secrets in a melody
 fire it at the fortress of your mind
And if after all I sing
 you don't believe a thing
That's alright
 we got all night

Calling down the lion of love
 use me
Calling down the lion of love
 use me

Use my heart
 use my hands
Use me any way you can
 Calling down the lion of love

So much trouble in the world
 so much pain
I've heard it all before
 I'll hear it again
But I'm trying to imagine
 a world transformed by love
Open up my mind's eye
 and let the pictures flood
Imagine that it's real
 what does it look like, how does it feel
Hold the vision
 bring it down, spread it around

Calling down the lion of love
 use me
Calling down the lion of love
 use me

Use my vision
 use my voice
I've had a vision 
 and I've made my choice

Calling down the lion of love
