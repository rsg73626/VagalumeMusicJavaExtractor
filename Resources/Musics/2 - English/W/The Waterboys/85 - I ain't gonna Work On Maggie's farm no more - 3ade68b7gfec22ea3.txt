I AIN'T GONNA WORK ON MAGGIE'S FARM NO MORE

(Bob Dylan)

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
 I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I wake up every morning
 hold my hands and pray for rain
I've got a head full of ideas
 driving me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
 well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Well, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
He hands you a nickel
 he hands you a dime
He asks you and your friends
 if you're having a good time
He blames you every time you slam the door
 Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Well, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
He stubs his cigarette out in your face just for kicks
 his bedroom window is made out of bricks
And the National Guard are standing at his door
 well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Well, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's mother no more
 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's mother no more
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law
 and everybody swears she's the brains behind Pa
She's sixty-eight, but claim's she's twenty-four
 well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
 I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

I try so hard to be just who I am
 but everybody wants you to be just like them
They say "see, while you're playing I get bored" ??
 well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
 
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
