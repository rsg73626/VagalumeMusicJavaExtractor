HAS ANYBODY HERE SEEN HANK

I ain't here for to do any business
 (I got nobody special to thank/I'm not looking for glory or thanks)
I'm trying to find 
 a friend of mine
Has anybody here seen Hank

Well he's sure to be wearing a Stetson
 he's as long and as thin as a plank
He's got a fistful of charm
 and a gun beneath his arm
Has anybody here seen Hank

Now he ain't in the back of a limo
 and he ain't in his bed
He ain't in jail
 he ain't out on bail
He ain't getting out of his head

I don't care what he did with his women
 I don't care what he did when he drank
I want to hear just one note
 from his lonesome old throat
Has anybody here seen Hank

Has anybody here, has anybody here
 has anybody here seen Hank
