ALL THE THINGS SHE GAVE ME

All the things
 all the things she gave me
All the things
 all the things she gave me

I wrapped them up 
 in a big brown box
Tied it with ribbon
 drove to the docks
Checked my time
 by the old town clock
All the things...

I saw the watchman
 he was blowing into
Cupped hands
 as he walked to the car
He said "Where do you think
 you're drivin' to, Son?
All good folks are in bed
 and a day's work is done"

I said "I'm just looking for
 someplace to burn
All the things
 all the things that she gave me...
All the things that she gave me
 where do I put them?
Where can I hide them
 where I won't have to see them?"

It's dark as hell here
 this city's grown cold
The devil's in drag
 playing poker with souls
The lots are all empty
 the last man is out
The moon's made of cheese
 and God is a boy scout

When I go to sleep 
 I'll be dreaming about 
All the things...
 
Then I'll dream about churches
 with great tall spires
Cathedrals and candles
 chimneys and choirs
I'll dream about
 THAT place
Where I set fire
 all the things
All the things that she...
