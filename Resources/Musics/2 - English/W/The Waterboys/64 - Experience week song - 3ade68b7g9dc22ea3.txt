EXPERIENCE WEEK SONG

Saturday morning experience week
 I'm so nervous I can hardly speak
Arrive at Cluny Hill half past ten
 almost turned and went home again
 yes, I almost turned and went home again

My focaliser showed me my room
 felt like she was consigning me to my doom
What am I doing here? What's going on?
 who are these people? What are they on?
 who are these people? What are they on?

Here's comes my roommate, he sure looks weird
 wild black hair and a big fuzzy beard
I met the rest of the group after lunch
 what a strange and motley bunch
 what a strange and motley bunch

Come Sunday morning, I'm feeling bad
 enjoyed the dancing but now I'm sad
Things feel different don't know why
 feeling lonely, want to cry
 feeling lonely, want to cry

Monday morning, learned everybody's names
 we go down to the ballroom to play some games
Something happened I can barely describe
 changed my feelings, changed my life
 changed my feelings, changed my life

Tuesday morning with a Hoover in my hand
 cleaning out the dining room, beginning to understand
Tuning in, tuning out
 starting to see what Findhorn is all about
 starting to see what Findhorn is all about

Wednesday morning in the winter sunshine
 down to Cullerne Gardens and everybody's feeling fine
This wonderful place as smooth as a dream
 where eleven strangers become a team
 where eleven strangers just become a team

Thursday morning at a quarter past three
 I'm wide-awake in the sanctuary
Opening myself to the love and a light
 thanking God for steering me right
 thanking God for steering me right

So now it's Friday almost time to go home
 and back into the big wide world I must roam
But I'll take it with me every single thing
 send it out with every song I sing
 send it out with every song I sing

So that's the tale of my experience week
 it was beautiful and it was unique
It made me friends and it opened my heart
 this isn't the end -- it's just the start!
