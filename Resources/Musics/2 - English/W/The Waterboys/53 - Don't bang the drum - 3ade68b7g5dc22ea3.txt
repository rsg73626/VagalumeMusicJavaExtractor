DON'T BANG THE DRUM

Well here we are in a special place
what are you gonna do here? 
Now we stand in a special place
what will you do here? 
What show of soul are we gonna get from you? 
It could be deliverance, or history
under these skies so blue
could be something true, 
But if I know you you'll bang the drum
like monkeys do

Here we are in a fabulous place
What are you gonna dream here? 
We are standing in this fabulous place
What are you gonna play here? 
I know you love the high life, you love to leap around
You love to beat your chest and make your sound
but not here man - this is sacred ground
with a Power flowing through
And if know you you'll bang the drum
like monkeys do

Here we stand on a rocky shore
Your father stood here before you
I can see his ghost explore you
I can feel the sea implore you
Not to pass on by
Not to walk on by
and not to try
Just to let it come
Don't bang the drum
Just let it come
Don't bang the drum
Just let it come
Don't bang the drum
Do you know how to let it come now? 
don't bang the drum
Just let it come now..
don't bang the drum...
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
Don't bang the drum
