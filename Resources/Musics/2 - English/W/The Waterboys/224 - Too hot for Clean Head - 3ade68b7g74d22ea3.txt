TOO HOT FOR CLEAN HEAD

Well it's too hot for the baker man
 too hot for the laundry man
Too hot for the fireman
 but it's alright
It ain't too hot for Clean Head
 he's gonna blow all night

Well it's too hot for the bogey man
 too hot for the Gardai man
Too hot for the candy man
 but it's alright
It ain't too hot for Clean Head
 he's gonna blow all night

Well it's too hot for Spiderman
 too hot for Superman
Too hot for Joker Man
 but it's alright, yes it's alright
It ain't too hot for Clean Head
 he's gonna blow all night

Well it's too hot for the Galway man
 too hot for the Mayo man
Too hot for the Kerry man
 but it's alright, yes it's alright
It ain't too hot for Clean Head
 he's gonna blow all night

Well it's too hot for the fiddle man
 too hot for the drummer man
Too hot for the guitar man
 but it's alright, yes it's alright
It ain't too hot for Clean Head
 he's gonna blow all night
