IONA SONG

Iona, sweet Iona
 island out of time
Your lost child is returning
 his shadow close behind
Anger in his breast
 black dog in his mind

I feel like an island of rage
 in a vast sea of peace
Like a worm in a cathedral
 like a beggar at a feast
Columba heal my black heart!
 let my nightmare cease

Lace upon the window
 patterns on the sheets
Three ships in the distance
 horsemen in the street
Lord God fit me
 to be your hands and feet
