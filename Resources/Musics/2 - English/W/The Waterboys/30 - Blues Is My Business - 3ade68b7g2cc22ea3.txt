BLUES IS MY BUSINESS

Blues is my business
evil follows me around
Blues is my business
evil follows me around
I'm a self serving son of a dog
here to bring you down

I've got thousands of names
way too many to tell
I've got thousand of names
way too many to tell
But don't you worry 'bout it baby
you already know me well

I'm at the east, west, north, south
all four corners of the globe
I'm at the east, west, north, south
all four corners of the globe
You better watch out where you're going
in case you meet me on the road

I'm the Dean of disaster,
the uncrowned King of crime
I'm the Dean of disaster,
the uncrowned King of crime
I'm an old past master
come around one more time

I took that old Ronnie Reagan
and I put him right on the top
I took that old Ronnie Reagan
and I put him right on the top
Laughed so hard
thought I'd never stop

Blues is my business
pain is my calling card
Blues is my business
pain is my calling card
Sure do love to hurt you baby
makes me feel like I'm a star
