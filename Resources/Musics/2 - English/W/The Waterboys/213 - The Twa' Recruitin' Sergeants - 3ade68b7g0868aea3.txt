THE TWA' RECRUITIN' SERGEANTS

It's over the mountain and over the main
through Gibralter tae France and tae Spain
Put a feather in yer bunnet, a kilt upon yer knee
Enlist, bonnie laddie and come awa' wi' me !

Twa' recruitin' sergeants come frae the Black Watch
tae merkits and fairs some recruits for to catch
but a' they've enlisted is forty and twa'
so 'list, bonnie laddie, come, come awa'

It's over the mountain...

Oh laddie dae ye ken o' the danger you're in
if yer horse breaks his leg or yer midden fa's in
Yon greely old fermer, he widna' pay yer fee
so 'list, bonnie laddie, come awa' wi' me

It's intae the barn and oot o' the byre
Yon greely auld fermer thinks you're never tired
It's a slavery job of lowly degree
so 'list, bonnie laddie, come awa' wi' me

It's over the mountain...

Oh laddie dae ye hae a sweethert at hame ?
If she kens you're afraid, will she no' be ashamed ?
You'll be back at her breest in no time at a'
so 'list, bonnie laddie, come, come awa'

It's over the mountain and over the main
through Gibralter tae France and tae Spain
Put a feather in yer bunnet, a kilt upon yer knee
Enlist, bonnie laddie and come awa' wi' me !
