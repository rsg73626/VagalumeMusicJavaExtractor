WHERE ARE YOU NOW WHEN I NEED YOU?

Hey Johnny, where are you now when I need you?
 now when I need you so bad?
Just one word come straight from your heart
 makes me feel so glad!
Death and disease walz together like starlets in this place
 I sure would like to see your honest face

Hey Eddie, where are you now when I miss you?
 now when I miss you like hell?
If you were here I know you'd make me
 believe again in myself!
You don't owe me nothing
 I'm not calling you away
So please don't feel accused when I say

Where are you now when I need you?
 now when I need you so bad?
My heads almost exploding
 and the tension drives me mad
And maybe you wonder
 do I really believe I need you?
But I do!

Hey you, where are you now when I dream about you
 in nightmares every night?
You were on a big wheel high above me
 almost out of my sight
And just as I wake you shout down something that sounds like 
 "Why are you not free?"
But by the time I'm dressed
 you're just a memory

Where are you now when I need you?
 now when I need you so bad?
When my heads almost exploding
 and this tension drives me mad
And maybe you wonder
 do I really believe I need you?
But I do!

Hey mama, where are you now I hurt for you?
 I hurt for you so hard?
If you heard this song, I know you you'd come straight for me
 you'd come somehow, no matter how far
There's a hundred things that I want to say to you
 And they come rushing through my head
But when we meet like we always do, we leave the best things unsaid
 and my god! Isn't that lonely?
That's lonely as hell
 to know the truth always but to be too scared to tell

Where are you now when I need you?
 now when I need you so bad?
When my hearts almost exploding
 and this tension drives me mad
And maybe you wonder
Do I really believe I need you?
But I do!
 but I do!
