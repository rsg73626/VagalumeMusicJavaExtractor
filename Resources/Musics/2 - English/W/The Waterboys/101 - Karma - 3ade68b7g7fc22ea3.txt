KARMA

I'm working out my karma
 I'm gonna get myself in line
I'm working out my karma
 (I'm gonna get myself in line/
 ain't wasting no more time)
I'm gonna pay back all my debts
 set up a brand new state of mind
I'm clearing out my system
 no more drugs and self-abuse
I'm clearing out my system
 no more drugs and self-abuse
(I'm gonna find the magic in me/
I'm gonna locate the magic inside of me)
 spread the good news!

(Well, I'm dressing like a rockstar
 and I feel like a king
Ain't got no hits but I
 sure got a whole ot of swing
I'm alive on the inside
 and that's the first thing

Now you can cheat me out of my money
 if that's what you really wanna do
Yeah, you can cheat me out of my money, honey
 and buy yourself a brand new boogaloo
I should hope you think it's funny when it
 come back around on you!)

I can hear the music changing
 I can feel the river rolling on
I can hear the music changing
 (I can feel the river rolling on/
 rhyme, rhythm, groove, tune and song)

I can (see/feel) the moment flashin' before my face
 then it's gone

I'm working out my karma
 I'm gonna get myself in line
I'm working out my karma
 (I'm gonna get myself in line - this time/
 ain't wasting no more time)
I'm gonna pay back all my debts
 set up a brand new state of mind - waaah!
