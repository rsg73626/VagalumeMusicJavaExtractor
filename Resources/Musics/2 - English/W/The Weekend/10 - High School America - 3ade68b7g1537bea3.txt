HIGH SCHOOL AMERICA

Maybe if you think twice, you might look nice
And maybe if youd follow your own advice, Ill see you at your show, but how should I know.
Iv taken you for granted, im sorry now.
I never should have slanted, please take a bow.
Iv fallen for your act, now how about that.
And You act like you are 13 years old you never do what you are told.
You kiss just like the angel that I know oh oh.
When I was looking for an answer, it dawned on me.
Im getting so much closer, you made me see
You're closing all the doors and making me yours.
And your pointing all the arrows, they point at you.
you Sing just like the sparrows you know you do.
And after that first song im singing along.

And I dont know what i'd do with out you, Dont know why im always so blue, when the last time I checked 1 plus 1 makes 2..me and you
OH and im walking the tight rope, the shortest one its looking like theres no hope But im not entire positivly sure there isnt a cure.
And you're every thing Id hope for, you knew all that
Before you I was such a bore, I tip my hat
And after every line you're suddenly mine.
