HEARD IT ON THE RADIO

Surly theres an explanation, ruby lips a last temptation i shake my hips in celebration baby.
And theres no tellin what your gonna do, toss me out like yesterdays news. make it hard for me to like you baby.
*and i was happy for you this i know
I heard it on the radio and i miss you more with every day but really we work well this way. so you go your way and ill go mine.*
Now some one tell me why i even care write it down some where ill meet you there. who said loving you was ever fair baby.
Now forgive me for wanting every thing candle lit, write me off because i gave a @#%$, don't you worry ill get over it baby.
*chorus*
At least our hearts are always healing thou the thought of it leaves me reeling but at least i know i'm still feeling well ya at least i still know at least i still know

Surly theres an explanation, ruby lips a last temptation i shake my hips in celebration baby.
