MY WAY

Baby you're so clever, I never thought about it.
We should get together, Ill take another hit I go home a o o alone.
And it should be forever, I never thought about it
Give yourself the pleasure, I take another hit I go home a o o alone

*And maybe when we get back get back then. We can talk about it then.*

And you're such easy pray, why dont you think about it.
You should run away, why take another hit I go home a o o alone.
And when you see the day, why dont you think about it
Maybe I should stay, why take another hit I go home a o o alone.
*chorus*
And baby its my way or the highway, ya its my way or the highway(x3)
