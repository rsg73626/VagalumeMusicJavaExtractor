80'S ROCK STAR

You, you used to rock me 
In your acid-wash jeans in 1983 
You, with your big hair 
Girls would throw you their underwear 
I was only old enough to stare 
And wish you were mine 

Well, you (you) were my rock 'n' roll dream 
Staring back at me from every magazine 
I was in love with your hair spray 
Your spandex and rebel ways! 
I just couldn't wait to see you play 
But just look at you today 

[Chorus] 
My 80's rock star 
They wonder where you are 
Wish you were here with me 
Instead of on the streets 
My 80's rock star 
They thought you'd go real far 
My 80's rock star 

Oh, you (you) you'd made & lost your fortune 
By the time your second album came and fell 
Spent it all on your fast drugs, your fast girls, your fast cars 
When the 90's came, you sold your last guitar 

[Chorus] 

They thought you'd go real far 
But you're washed out, and you're lonely, and you're tired 
And there's not much left to you to admire 
And you gave the world everything you had 
And were left with nothing, now how about that? 

My 80's rock star 
They wonder where you are 
Well now you're here with me 
Instead of on the streets 
My 80's rock star 
They thought you'd go real far 
My 80's rock star 
They wonder where you are 
Well now you're here with me 
Instead of on the streets 
My 80's rock star 
They thought you'd go real far 

Yeah!
