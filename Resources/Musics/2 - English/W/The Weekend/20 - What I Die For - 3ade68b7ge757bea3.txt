WHAT I DIE FOR

Blue eyes i think of you, its easy.
Some how i just thought that youd complete me.
And days will come and days will go without you.
Never know just what it is im going to do

 look at me im on the street and im dancing.
Look behind your sunglasses your eyes..sing$

See you with your arms wrapped round another, makes me wonder why i even bother.

*well dont you know you're what i live for what i die for. heartbreak running through my vanes just make me want more.
Cant see you see my tears fall when you walk out the door.
Well dont you know your what i live for what i die for*

Too late to just let you go im stuck here.
Waiting for a word from you that sounds sincere.
Standing on a mountain top im falling.
Stary nights they move me when you're calling.
