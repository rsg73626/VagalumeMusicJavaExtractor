KICK MYSELF

Kick Myself
(Wasse/Robertson)

I am too easily blown away,
too easily led astray 
by a boy with that look in his eyes. 

I get too stupid to run from the heat,
too dizzy to land on my feet
he’s making the room spin, don’t know what I’m thinking tonight. 

I’m diving head first into something, 
better judgement’s gone a running
.................. tonight

Nothing but trouble on his mind- I come across it all the time but I’m not getting smarter from it, 
I kick myself for getting careless, 
kick myself for getting like this:

Easy. COMPLETELY easy.

He’s telling me all the right stuff, 
I’m sure that I can’t get enough
that boy’s got that look in his eyes. 

He has total control over me, 
I’m falling right down at his feet
I’m drunk and I’m laughing, he’s making the room spin tonight

I’m heading straight into disaster, 
we all know what he is after tonight.

Nothing but trouble on his mind- I come across it all the time but I’m not getting smarter from it, 
I kick myself for getting careless, 
kick myself for getting like this:

Easy. COMPLETELY easy.
