THE SINGLE

I go too far to say, its just another day.
You've got a brand new face, some thing i cant erase.
The damage in your eye, some thing i cant deny.
Soldiers in suits of grey, we watch them work all day.
And i saw you standing there you know ill never care.
Soldiers in suits of grey, i love you any way.

*i know you got it when im on your mind another celebration for you. you've got it going and i know your mine another revolation comes true*
And i saw you standing there, he hopes you'll never care.
Hide from your russian spies, we wait with watching eyes.
And i fell with out a thought, and now hey what a shove.(not 100% on that)
You'll always number 1, count all your chicks and run.

*chorus*

Youv got it going, youv got it going on far from here.
Its kinda silly, i cant believe its so far from here.

*chorus*
