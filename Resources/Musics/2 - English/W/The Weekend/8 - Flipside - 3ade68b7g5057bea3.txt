FLIPSIDE

You said to meet you on the flipside, baby
I'd love to, i'd love to
You promise things will be different
And maybe
I'll believe you honie, i'll believe you
You say you're ready for commitment,
Oh my
There you go with your wandering eye...
You leave me, regret it and
You come crawling back
I tell you i hate you but i'll still let you in
You say "old dogs can't learn new tricks"

But on the flip flip flipside
Where the right is wrong and
Wrong feels so right
Every single mind numbing fight
Only makes me love you more

I'm dreaming of the flip flip flipside
Where white is black
And black is snow white
And every single heartbreaking night
Only makes me love you more

There may be other lovers,
Some might offer diamonds
Some might offer me the world
But i don't want them
Cause honey they're not you
- you're running through my veins
I try to detox but you're still in my system
Honey im damaged goods
You broke it so you bought it
When you're not with me
I forget how to function

Oh honey,honey no
I will not let this go!
I keep holding out, keep holding onto

The flip flip flipside
Where the right is wrong and
Wrong feels so right
Every single mind numbing fight
Only makes me love you more

I'm dreaming of the flip flip flipside
Where white is black
And black is snow white
And every single heartbreaking night
Only makes me love you more
