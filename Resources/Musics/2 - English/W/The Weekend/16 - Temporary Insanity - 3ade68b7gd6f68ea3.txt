TEMPORARY INSANITY

What just happened?
Did you kiss me?
'Cuz that's a place we've never been
Until now
And I dunno
How we're gunna be after this
Do we pretend these feelings don't exist at all?
Or do we fall?

My confusion shows
Whenever you
Stand so close
I stumble
I stutter
Forget what to say
I'm nervous
I wonder why I'm acting this way

(Chorus)
It's temporary insanity
What going on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
Woh-oh-oh (x2)

You made a move
Don't change your mind
Too much to lose
We've crossed the line
Between friends and something more
Was it all a big mistake?
'Cuz if it was it's much too late to undo
And I don't really want to

Let you go
But I still don't know
How I feel about you
What this really means
It's crazy to want you
Is it meant to be?

Its temporary insanity
What’s goin’ on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?(x2)
Woh-oh-oh(x2)

Hey what you do to me

What’s come over me?

If this is crazy
There's nothing I'd rather be
Than here with you now
Let’s figure this out

Here with you now(x2)

Its temporary insanity
What goin' on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?(x2)

(Losin' my mind)(x2)
(What’s goin’ on?)
(Losin my mind)(x3)

Insanity
What you do to me
