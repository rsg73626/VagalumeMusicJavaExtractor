BOY YOU

Boy you sure look pretty when the lights are Dim
I'm kind of drunk I told you so
Kiss someone I shouldn't have
The music's loud let's go to where the drinks don't blow
And he was overwhelming at his best
He took me by the hand and said let's get this party right
Pretend I'm the one tonight

He said, hey now, I adore you to
He said, hey now, I adore you to
He said, hey now, I adore you to

Because it's better to think that you're falling for me
Then to know that you're stuck in the past
It's better to think that you're falling for me
Then to know that this feeling won't last

Over compensating for my lack of interest
I said maybe we should talk
He heard something different and he thought that I said maybe we should take a walk
But he said he'd take me as I am. Just strung out on another man.And he don't seem to hear me right
But I'm the one for him tonight

He said, hey now, I adore you to
He said, hey now, I Adore you to
He said, hey now, I Adore you to

Because it's better to think that you're falling for me
Then to know that you're stuck in the past
It's better to think that you're falling for me
Then to know that this feeling won't last
