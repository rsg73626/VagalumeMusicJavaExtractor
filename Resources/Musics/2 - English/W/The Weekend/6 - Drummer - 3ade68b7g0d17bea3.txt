DRUMMER

If I'm thinking for 2, iv got a lot of sweet drinking out to do.
He reminds me of a drummer that I once knew just passing through

*And I went with the flow now I know what I know.
That was then this is now and I understand how, how I know where to go*

And I cancelled that call, I thought about it and I want it all.
So I picked up the pieces you left on the floor and went out for more.
*chorus*
And I know that we took them by surprise.
And I know we were right before their eyes, and its about time. Yeah its about time.
So I walked through the door, They looked right at me but could not ignore.
And the drinks were expensive the stories were tall but I had a ball.
And I cancelled that call, you thought about it and you'd want it all. So you picked up the pieces I left on the floor and walked out that door.
*chorus*
And I know that we took them by surprise.
And I know we were right before their eyes and its about yeah its about time(x2)
