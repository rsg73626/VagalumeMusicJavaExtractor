NYLA

You say you like new york better than
L.a. and i just sit there
I believe that you like lookin'
Like a ramone
When i would rather kiss a beach boy
Feel the sand beneath my toes
Wanna feel the sun burning up my nose
I'll give you all of my black clothes
Just light your smoke and watch me go...
Well

Chorus
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully and
Maybe then you'll see:
That this time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time this time
Next year next year i wont be here

Cause i'm so sick of dreary winters
And mornings spent in subway stations
Going to a job i hate
More and more with everyday
I want the lifestyle of the rich and famous
While you'd prefer to remain nameless
But thats you (hey) and this is me,
I'm gonna live the fantasy
Well

Chorus
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully and
Maybe then you'll see:
That this time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time, next year, i wont be here

You say you like new york better than
L.a. and i just sit there
I believe that you like looking
Like a ramone
When i would rather kiss a beach boy
Come come come again
What was that you said?
Listen carefully and maybe then you'll see

Chorus
Come come come again
What was that you said?
Listen carefully and maybe then you'll see:
That this time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time, next year, i wont, be here
This time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time this time
Next year next year i wont be here
This time, next year, i wont, be here
Oh
Come come come again
What was that you said?
Listen carefully and maybe then you'll see.
