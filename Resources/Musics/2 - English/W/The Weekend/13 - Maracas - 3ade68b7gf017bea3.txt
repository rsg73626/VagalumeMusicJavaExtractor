MARACAS

I'm the queen of the castle when no ones around.
And Ill give you my number when my feet touch the ground.
I stand tall, I can't fall for you.
And I will never recover from the heat of that night, and I will go undercover till the timing is right. 
We stand straight, I wont wait for you.

And I will never be the same, tell me you wont either.
I'll never fall again him a firm believer that "if you snooze you loose" That "if you snooze you loose"

And it is all too familiar how you start what I end.
Till theres a lining of silver him not willing to bend.
And birds sing, the bells ring for you.

And you know what him under and the thoughts that him in.
And I cant help but wonder just who's blessing this sin.
I said time would tell and I fell for you.
