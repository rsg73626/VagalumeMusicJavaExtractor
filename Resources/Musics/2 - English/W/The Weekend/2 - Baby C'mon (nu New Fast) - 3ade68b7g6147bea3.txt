BABY C'MON (NU NEW FAST)

Coming down this road for the millionth time this year but i know some body who lives here and shes doing just fine.
Now iv forgotten my loss and iv put on plenty of lip gloss and we'll get there when ever we get there we got plenty of time.
So climb out my window and make sure its shut tight.
Every thing is gonna be alright just get in the car
And ill say goodbye to the sleeping cause theres no time left for show but then again just who would know the genius you are.

*only one could let me down and why did it have to be you. keep me on this run-around now why did i have to make due.
Just get me out of this damn towwwwwn, see me coming right behind you.*

And you can tell my mother that ill be back home in the morning, and this isnt some kind of a warning just thought you should know.
And so lets pop that tape on and fill up at the gas station and we'll get there when ever we get there(x3) we've got plenty of time.
*chorus*
