FLEETWOOD

I will try when hes gone.
And i wont reminisce bout the kisses ill miss ill move on.
I don't like, what you are.
Cause you tell me i'm wrong when i'm just being strong its so far.

*and i was every thing back then, i wasn't sure how this should end*

Now i wont, fall apart.
Ill just wither away cause i know that he'll stay in my heart.
Now i know, who was wrong.
Well i almost forgot all the things that i'm not the list is so very long.
*chorus* and ill say no more(x3)
Seek what is true there were pleasantries spoken many promises broken and tensions they grew.
And now iv had my fill
And ill dance on his grave just to prove that i'm brave i feel ill
*chorus* and ill say no more(x3)
