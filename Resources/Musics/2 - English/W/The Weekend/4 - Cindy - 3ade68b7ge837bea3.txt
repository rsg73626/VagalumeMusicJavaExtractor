CINDY

Cindy she's the one to watch out for.
Look at her on the dance floor, feeling so at ease.
*There are 37 boys on her left side I wonder who'll get the free ride, she's easy as can be.*

Cindy she's something of a disaster and nothing ever gets past her.
Watch her as she walks by.
Air thick cigarette smoke I was choking and some body spoke she was laughing, and I dont Think I really want to know why no no.

Cindy you'd better watch out youd better watch out for. Cindy, you'd better watch out for me.

*chorus*

Cindy you'd better watch out youd better watch out for. Cindy, you'd better watch out for me.(x2)
oooooooooooooh(repeat till end)
