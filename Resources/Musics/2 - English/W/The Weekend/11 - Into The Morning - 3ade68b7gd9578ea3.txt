INTO THE MORNING

Thinking of you - yeah, I'll think of you all day - think of your kiss kissing my lips... I'll remember this always. Got the goofiest grin - got a big smile on my face - hey you, let's get out of this place... grab my hand, let's go. 

Say it's young love at it's best and I tell you I'll remember:
Breaking you out through your bedroom window, sneaking you into my parents' house and staying out all night and into the morning into the morning breaking you out through your bedroom window, sneaking you into my parents' house and staying out all night and into the morning until the sun comes up and ruins it all.

Monday morning's first class - ditch it! - we'll hang out in the parking lot...
Only the two of us We'll make out til the stars come out - lay and watch them - that one looks just like the one in your eyes... c'mon grab my hand and let's go 

Say it's young love at it's best and I tell you I'll remember:
Breaking you out through your bedroom window, sneaking you into my parents' house and staying out all night and into the morning into the morning breaking you out through your bedroom window, sneaking you into my parents' house and staying out all night and into the morning until the sun comes up and ruins it all.

... drinking peach schnapps and hanging out in our underwear... going to parties and leaving because there's noone there... skipping our classes cause really we don't even care about anything at all... we'll get tatoos that we swear we'll never hate... break the rules and stay out way too late... ain't life grand, isn't it great having no care in the world?

Say it's young love at it's best and I tell you I'll remember:
Breaking you out through your bedroom window, sneaking you into my parents' house and staying out all night and into the morning into the morning breaking you out through your bedroom window, sneaking you into my parents' house and staying out all night and into the morning until the sun comes up and ruins it all.


It was young love at it's best and it's you that I'll remember
