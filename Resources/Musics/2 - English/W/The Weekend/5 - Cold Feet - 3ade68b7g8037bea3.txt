COLD FEET

Unwrap your heart for me because mint
Condition just means that you havn't
Been living
Who taught you to be so safe anyways?
A scar is just a battle wound
That tells the tale of earlier days
Before cold feet...
I can't tell you that your heart
Won't get broken
But c'mon now - throw a little caution to the wind
You could run away scared or look it
Straight in the eye and tell it :i don't want you comming here no more!" ... don't wait for it's reply
Tell me what are you afraid of?
Skinned knees and swaying trees?
The world outside? oh honey, honey
Please don't be getting cold feet
You say "you don't know what i've been through!!"
Why don't you tell me then,
Cause i'd really like to
Don't keep your heart under lock and key
Cause if you do
It won't find its way to me
