THERE GOES MY HEART

I fell in love.
I didn't want to but you snuck right in,
Tripped me and watched me tumble
Head over heels over you-
Then watched me hit the ground.
But then i let you in 'cause
I like what you're saying!!;
"c'mon cmon(x3) we're going out tonight- don't
Try to run- don't try to hide- don't even try to fight- i'm taking over-we're gonna get this right- c'mon(x4), we're going out tonight"
