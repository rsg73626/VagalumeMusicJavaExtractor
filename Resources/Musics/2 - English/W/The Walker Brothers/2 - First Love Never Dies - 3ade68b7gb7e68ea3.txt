FIRST LOVE NEVER DIES

All at once i miss you 
So long since i kissed you 
How i long to look into your eyes 
Yes i still dream about you 
My world is lost without you 
For you were my first love 
And first love never ever dies 

Whenever i feel lonely 
I'm thinking of you only 
One last kiss 
And then we said goodbye 

The love i left behind me 
Comes back to remind me 
That you were my first love 
And first love never ever dies 

The love i left behind me 
Comes back to remind me 
That you were my first love 
And first love never ever dies 

And if you're thinking of me 
And you find you still love me 
Theres no use to living lies 
Lets hurry to each other 
Co's there could be no other 

Yes you were my first love 
And first love never ever dies 

First love never ever Dies
