I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE

In my neighbourhood where folks don't live so good now.
The rooms are small most the building made of wood. 
I hear the neighbours talking 'bout you and me.
Yes i've heard most every word 
cos the taklins loud and the walls are much too thin.

She don't really love him. 
Oh that's what I heard them say. 
She sure wasn't thinking of him today.
I saw her in the courtyard say that girl in room one forty nine. 
talking to a boy I've never seen before, 
and standing there together don't you know they looked so fine.

No I don't want to hear it anymore
I don't want to hear it anymore.

Cos the talk just never ends and the heartache soon begins
the talk is so loud and the walls, they're much too thin.

Lord ain't it sad, s
aid the woman cross the hall,
that when a nice boy like that falls in love 
hey it's just too bad 
that he had to go and fall for a girl that doesn't care for him at all.

No I don't wanna hear it anymore.
I don't wanna hear it anymore.
Cos the talk just never ends and the heartache soon begins.
Oh they talk so loud and the walls are much too thin.
Oh I wish they wouldn't talk so loud and expose my heartache to the crowd.
