LOOKING FOR ME

I walk through the streets of the city
As quiet as quiet can be
The boys on the corner are looking for a fight
And all of 'em looking for me
I can't help it if I love her
She can't help loving me
But she was eddie's girl and he's got a lot of friends
And all of them looking for me

Never ran from trouble, don't intend to start now
But a fight's a-comin', now I'll face it somehow
Gotta get on by him, find my baby and then
Go to a place where no-one knows our face
And start all over again

Never ran from trouble, don't intend to start now
But a fight's a-comin', now I'll face it somehow
I walk through the streets of the city
As quiet as quiet can be
The boys on the corner are looking for a fight
And all of 'em looking for me
Yeah- all of 'em looking for me
Yeah- all of 'em looking for me
