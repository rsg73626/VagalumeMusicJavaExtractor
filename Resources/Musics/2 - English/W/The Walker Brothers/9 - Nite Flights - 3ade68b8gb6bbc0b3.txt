NITE FLIGHTS

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger brushing you
Turns its face into the heat
And runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stitches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks, featherweights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
Only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks, featherweights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
Only one promise, only one way to fall

On the nite flights, on the nite flights
On the nite flights, only one way to fall
On the nite flights, on the nite flights
On the nite flights, only one way to fall
