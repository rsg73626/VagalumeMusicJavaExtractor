THE SUN AIN'T GONNA SHINE (ANYMORE)

Loneliness is a cloak you wear
A deep shade of blue is always there

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love...
baby

Emptiness is a place you're in
With nothing to lose, but no more to win

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love

Lonely
Without you, baby
Girl, I need you
I can't go on

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
(The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky)
The tears are always clouding your eyes
(The tears are always clouding your eyes)
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love...
baby

(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
No, anymore
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
Baby...
Baby...
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
