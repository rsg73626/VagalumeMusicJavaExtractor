MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF

Oh, breaking up is so very hard to do
If you really love him, and there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings, just tell me that we're through

Ref.:And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And if the way I hold you, can't compare to his caress
No words of concilation will make me miss you less
My darling if this is goodbye, I just know I'm gonna cry
So run to him, before you start crying too

Ref.
Oh, baby, it's so hard to do
