WE'RE ALL ALONE

Outside the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore of dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me
'Neath the waves
Through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin

Throw it to the wind, my love
Hold me dear
All's forgotten now, my love
We're all alone
