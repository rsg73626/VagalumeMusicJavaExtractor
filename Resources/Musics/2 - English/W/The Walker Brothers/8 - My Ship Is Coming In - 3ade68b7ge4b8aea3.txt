MY SHIP IS COMING IN

Girl, you've been so good to me
Stayin' by my side through the bad times
All my dreams never came true somehow
But things are gonna be different now, little baby

My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My ship is comin' in
Now won't it be fine, girl
We're gonna make it this time

You can throw away that shabby dress
Buy yourself the finest things in town, girl
Dry your eyes, we're celebratin'
Oh, there's so many good times awaitin', baby

My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My ship is comin' in
Now won't it be fine, girl
We're gonna make it this time

I know it's been tough on you
But through it all you've been so true
Happy to be just lovin' me
And anything you want, it's yours, 'cause baby

My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My holy ship, I've been waiting and it's comin'
Oh, can't you see it, baby
