LOVE HER

Love her
and tell her each day
that girl needs to know
tell her so, tell her everything I couldn't say
Like she's warm,and she's sweet and shes's fine, 
Oh love her like I should have done.

And hold her, and show her you care. 
When her world is blue see her through any time that she needs you be there, 
by her side, be the guy that I couldn't be and love her, love her for me. 
Please love her, love her for me.

Hold her, and show her you care, 
when her world is blue see her through any time that she needs you be there, 
by her side,

Yeah, c'mon love her, love her for me.
