HERE COMES THE NIGHT

Here comes the night
see the stars in the sky, s
hining high above, 
light of love darling just you and I.
And a here come the night 
how I thrill to your kiss, music fills the air, 
everywhre night of magic and bliss. 

Think of the moments, the hours and hours that we were apart. 
Moments and hours that kept bringing showers of tears to my heart.

And here comes the night 
like the others before 
but tonight's divine you are mine once more.

Think of the moments, the hours and hours that we were apart. 
Moments and hours that kept bringing showers of tears to my heart.

And here comes the night 
like the others before 
but tonight's divine you are mine once more.
