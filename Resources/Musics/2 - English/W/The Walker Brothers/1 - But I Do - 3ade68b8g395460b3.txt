BUT I DO

Don't know why I love you, but I do
I don't know why I cry so
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
Don't know why, love you baby, but I do

I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do, feel so helpless
And since you went away, I cry both night and day
Don't know why, love you baby, but I do

My days have been so lonely, yeah, my nights are so blue now
I don't know how I stand it, oh but honey I do
I don't know why I love you, but I do
I don't why I cry, but I do
I guess I'm wasting time, but I got to clear my mind
Don't know why I love you baby, but I do
