LONELY IS A LIFETIME

No one really knows her first name
but they all hold her hand
Everyone leans on her windowpane but no one looks in
She's so far from home
But only the starlight can turn this town cold
And lonely is a lifetime of getting used to being alone
So where do you go?
The street lights come with a cool breeze
and she waits all night
And just before the morning sunlight
she breaks down and cries
She's trying to make it right
But only the starlight can turn this town cold
And lonely is a lifetime of getting used to being alone
So where do you go?
And only the starlight can turn this town cold
And lonely is a lifetime of getting used to being alone
So where do you go?
