BACKWOODS COMPANY

In the Backwoods Company
Praying hands and bended knee
Forced to gamble, learn to cheat
In the Backwoods Company

Lay me down by the old oak tree
Don't cut my hair when they bury me
Light me up then set me out to sea

In the Backwoods Company
Pray for Jesus, forgive me
Smoking pistol, burned my hand
In the Backwoods, they understand

Lay me down by the old oak tree
Don't cut my hair when they bury me
Light me up then set me out to sea

Lay me down by the old oak tree
Don't cut my hair when they bury me
Light me up then set me out to sea
Light me up then set me out to sea
