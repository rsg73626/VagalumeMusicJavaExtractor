HARD WIND

Hard Wind
Don't matter where I turn
Hard Wind
Like a wild fire burns

Cold eyes
Looking back at where I'm from
Western skies
I been chasing down the sun

I sold my ticket to this one track mind
I see for miles 'cuz I have opened my eyes
Oh lord

Windows down
And street lights glow
Pink clouds
And stories of my home
White smoke
Coming to set me free
I'm hollow
I've got nothing left to bleed

I sold my ticket to this one track mind
I see for miles 'cuz I have opened my eyes
I kissed the interstate
And left it all behind
I try to tell myself to let it go
The weight I carry is getting hard to hold
One thing's for certain
I'm never coming back
