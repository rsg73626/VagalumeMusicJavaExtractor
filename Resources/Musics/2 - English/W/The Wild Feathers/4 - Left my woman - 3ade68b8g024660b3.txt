LEFT MY WOMAN

Left My Woman
I remember holding you down
Under the waters of your hometown

And Oklahoma is just a memory
California is where I'll be

They say down in Texas, oh, there ain't much rain
So I found a season
You know she ain't gonna change

Left my woman at home
All my money is gone
I can't stand it, leaving you all alone
Left my woman

Giles County
Is too small for me
Oh, but I feel the cold winds
Leaving Tennessee

The open highways
The narrow roads
It's hard to stay here
And gettin' harder to go

When she looks through my window
Oh, and touches the door
Well, she is the light
I always get up for

Left my woman at home
All my money is gone
I can't stand it, leaving you alone
Left my woman

I'm sure that I'll be gone 'til December
This winter ain't cold enough for me
Still need you to get me through the weather
You know it rains like I bleed yeah

Left my woman at home
All my money is gone
I can't stand it, leaving you all alone
Left my woman
