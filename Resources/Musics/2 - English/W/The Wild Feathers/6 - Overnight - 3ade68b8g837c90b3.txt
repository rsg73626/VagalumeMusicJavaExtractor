OVERNIGHT

Death and money all at once


Give me something true and real
Give me something I can feel
Take me back to when I was a child
When I first heard my favorite song
Take me back to when I was young and wild
When I could dream all day long





Always looking for the light



And you never think you were wrong








Why would you stay?
Every time I turn around


Its not like they do, no
Every time I come around
