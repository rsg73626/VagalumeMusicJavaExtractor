THE WITCH

It starts like this, the kiss is a kiss
The kiss is a kiss, smiles are all smiles.
Say your goodbyes, 'cause love will decide.

Your life in hand, you made your demands
And now what else can you do?
'cause that won't mean love
Love will decide.

Your world was always mine,
Your world was always mine.
It's dark on me, driving
Through central michigan
Listening to the country station
And wandering where I stand.
Love will decide, love will decide.
