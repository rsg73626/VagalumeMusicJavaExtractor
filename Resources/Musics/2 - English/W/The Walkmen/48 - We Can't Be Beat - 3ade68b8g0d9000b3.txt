WE CAN'T BE BEAT

I was the duke of her, the duke of her
But it couldn't last
I was the pony express, but I ran and again
Oooo
Golden dreams, golden dreams are losing glow
I don't need perfection, I love the hope
Ooooo
Give me a life that needs correction
Ooooo
Nobody loves, loves perfection
Oooooo
Loneliness, loneliness surround you through
All the kids are laughing, I'm laughing too.
Ooooo

Oh, if you want my eyes, take my eyes, they're always true
Oooo
If you want my heart, take my heart, is right here for you
Ooo
It's been so long, been so long, but I made it through
Ooo
It's been so long, been so long, but I made it through
It's been so long.

They'll never leave
Oooo
We can't be beat
Ooooo
We can't be beat
Oooo
We'll never eave
Oooo
We can't be beat
Oooo
The world is ours
Oooo
We can't be beat
Oooo
We can't be beat
Oooo
Oooo
