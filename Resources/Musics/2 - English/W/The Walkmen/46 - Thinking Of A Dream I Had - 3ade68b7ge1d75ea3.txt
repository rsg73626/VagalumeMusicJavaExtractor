THINKING OF A DREAM I HAD

I'm waiting on a subway line
I'm waiting for a train to arrive
I'm thinking of a dream I had
Maybe you're right

we're gonna have a good time tonight
cuz when you're coming around you'll be sorry for the plans we made
when you're coming around, you'll be sorry for the things you said so don't lead me on

And when you're coming around you'll be sorry for the things you said
because no one speaks to me that way, and me, I'll be hanging from the ceiling fan
