HEAVEN

Our children will always hear
The romantic tale of distant years
Our gilded age may come and go,
Our crooked dreams that always glow.
Stick with me, oh, you're my best friend
All of my life you'll always be.

Remember, remember,
All we fight for
Remember, remember,
All we fight for.

Don't leave me, oh,
You're my best friend
All of my life you'll always be.
Don't leave me now,
You're my best friend
All of my life you'll always be.

Remember, remember,
All we fight for
Remember, remember,
All we fight for.
