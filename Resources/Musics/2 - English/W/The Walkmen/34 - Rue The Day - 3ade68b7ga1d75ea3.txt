RUE THE DAY

I know you won't be thinking of me now, its been years.
But I hope you change your mind when we were introduced
We both laughed cause we've been friends since long before we met
today, but I never thought of you a single day.
But yesterday I remembered driving with no headlights
We would tip toe out in the evening.
Never done such things before, but I have never found once thinking of you since.
I'd be lying if I said your name never came up as
I'd be thinking of just how I'd like to cash my days in now.
And all I ever do is think of yesterday.
Man its hard to stand up straight all of the time.
We tip toe down to my basement.
Never done such things before.
I'd drive you home for goodness sake.
I could barely stand up straight.
Oh there's a memory calling, calling way too loud and way to strong.
Twisting all the bad things into good.
I'm a lucky guy now, but I'll never know until its gone.
Yeah I'll never know it till its gone.
