BOWS ARROWS

come on, come on let's have a song
the morning sun is soon to come
we don't have time to linger on

there comes a time, there comes a
time to make it right when I was wrong
and someday girl we'll get along.

Goodbye to all your plans
you can listen to me now
your head is bent out of shape
but your feet are on the ground
but all in all, the ceiling's coming down

I take my time to face the day
it's good to hear you talk this way
so we'll keep this up as friend
this time, nothing's wrong
I'll stand up as I'll shake your hand,
we'll be alright

Then I'll do it all again

That man he is a fraud, but nobody gives a damn
and then all and all, they'll all beweighing in

can I sleep on your floor tonight
give me some time to set this right
where's your head, there's nothing for you here, nothing's wrong
take a look around and you'll see it clear

Come on come on let's get things done, the morning sun has come and
gone, get up, get out and move along
there comes a time, there comes a time, to make it right when I was
wrong and someday girl we'll get along.
