NEW YEAR'S EVE

the music's loud, in your room, turn it down
there's a neighbor who can't take it any more
I'll take your hand, in another one night stand
there's a lot for us to figure out

so if this is how it ends, well lock the door behind you then and let
me down easy

The music's loud in your room turn it down, but the more we talk, the
less we understand
