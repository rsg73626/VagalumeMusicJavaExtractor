CLEMENTINE

you might say you give in, you’re sick of this
you might say you’d give up, you’ve had enough
you know that ain’t true, you know that ain't true
you got bored, honey that makes two of us

you might tell me again that you had enough of me
and should we pass on the street, i won’t even see you
but you know that ain’t true when you’re locked in your room
well i don’t do that now, cause honey i’m over you

you know that ain’t true, oh that ain't true
you got bored, honey that makes two of us

and you might tell me again that you had enough of me
should we pass on the street, i won’t even see you
but you know that ain’t true when you’re locked in your room.
you got bored and honey that makes two of us
