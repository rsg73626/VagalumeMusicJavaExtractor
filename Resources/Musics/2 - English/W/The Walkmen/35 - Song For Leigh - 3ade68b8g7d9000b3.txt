SONG FOR LEIGH

So, it began, another blessing hymn
Walk around the world, singing to my girl
Patience will keep you alive.

Run to the run
Wall to the wall

If you follow me where I'm going
It might take some time but you never know
In my constant shoes and my bird still sings
These tricks are tricks I've learned from the king.

And I sing myself sick, I sing myself sick,
I sing myself sick about you
(x2)

Run to the run
Wall to the wall

If you follow me where I'm going
It might take some time but you never know
In my constant shoes and my bird still sings
These tricks are tricks I've learned from the king.

And I sing myself sick, I sing myself sick,
I sing myself sick about you
