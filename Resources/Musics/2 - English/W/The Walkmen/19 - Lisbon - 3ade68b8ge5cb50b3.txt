LISBON

There's a girl that you should know
She was mine not so long ago
I remember how we fell in love
But we ended not that long

Lost my nerve and lost my head
Just about everything I had
Washed out in a wave of sea
Couldn't see my head in front of me

Woe is me
Woe is me

Yeah, do you wanna walk with me
By the trees and the factory?
And do you wanna hop the fence
In the sleepy red sunset?

There's a girl that you should know
She was mine not so long ago
I remember how we fell in love
But we ended not that long

Woe is me
Woe is me
Woe is me
Woe is me

Now the streetlight bright and pale
As we sip our ginger ale
Kiss you by the blinking sign
Don't get heavy, let's be light

On and on, live free
On and on, live free
On and on, live free
On and on, I can't wait
