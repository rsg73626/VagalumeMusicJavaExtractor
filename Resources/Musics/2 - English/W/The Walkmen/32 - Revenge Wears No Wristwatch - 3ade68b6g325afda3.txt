REVENGE WEARS NO WRISTWATCH

Anger, anger, treats me hard. 
I tell her I say. 
I've heard it all before, i've had it up to here. 
Such a mess, I am. 

You say, somethings wrong. 
This Kind of life style doesn't work. 
I'm trying something else. 
For a change, for a change. 
Thats ok, ok, ok. 

I've heard it all before, i've had it up to here. 
Such a shame, such a shame, such a shame
