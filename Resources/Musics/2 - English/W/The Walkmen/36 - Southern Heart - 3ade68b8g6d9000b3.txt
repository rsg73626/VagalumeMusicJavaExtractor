SOUTHERN HEART

Family comes from kentuky and
They're bourboning their blood,
Fell of the country for the city in 1951.
Me, I'm in between two worlds
So you on the tv last night.

Life is easy on the tv
When you're right in some blue inn
I fill my endings with images on hazy here after.
I don't nearly know your name
It's your southern heart I'm after
It's your southern heart I'm after.

Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
