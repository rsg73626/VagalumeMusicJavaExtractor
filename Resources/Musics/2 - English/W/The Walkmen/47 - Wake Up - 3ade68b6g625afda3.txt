WAKE UP

Out of station through my radio 
nothings on it
 like a joke thats told with out its final line 
where's it going 
where had it round 

I know 
I'm trying 
I'm trying to wake up 
wake up 

and I tell by you way too far 
looking back I had a casing sentimental suns and shade 
won't they ever spin around 
foward 
they're trying 
they're trying 
and so they do 

in the call of a new world 
as I climb to the next floor 
haven't we 
met before 
under brighter skies above 
above 

and in a way its fine 
we're walking through wind 
unfamiliar scenes 
we're choking on it 
and we're shaking hands with someone we dont know now 

wake up 
wake up
