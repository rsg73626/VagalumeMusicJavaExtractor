RED RIVER

The light is finally fading 
And so i say goodnight 
I step out in the darkness 
Around the firelight 
I step out in the darkness 
Lost my way around 
I'm going now 
but i'll be by tonight 
I'll get held up by this heart of mine 

I was forgotten and 
Buried in the ground 
I was reborn into this world 
Never made it out 

I wandered through the morning 
I strode along the lines 
I woke up in the trenches 
They left the dead behind 
I woke up in the trenches 
Burned up in the mud 
And now i'm gone 
It just bury me alive 
If i'm held up by this heart of mine 

Oh no 
It's all forgotten and 
Buried in the ground 
I was reborn into this world 
Never made it out 

Red River 
Carry me home 
I never 
Been so alone 
When the lime 
Messed up my eyes 
Red River 
Carry me home
