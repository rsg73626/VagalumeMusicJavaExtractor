THAT'S THE PUNCHLINE

I know, that your superstitious. 
That you follow glamour, 
your so caught up they push you around, and up and down. 
Because I see, its easy to be so blind. 
When you say remember his face. 
It's not so bad I say it cause its true. 
That's change of style your eccentric when you smile. 
That's change of style we could catch you but your always changing. 

That's the punch line that's the way it should be, 
and that's the last time you'll ever hear it from me. 
That's the punch line. 

How come in all of your fashion. 
Magazines and people, they always look so mean 
I know, I'm going down. 
And I'm rolling over, I'm sick of that cynical kind of humor 
Remember this world, its not so bad its coming after you. 

That's the punch line that's the way it should be. 
And that's the last time you'll ever hear it from me. 
That's the punch line. 

That's change of style, your eccentric when you smile. 
That's change of style when we laugh its cause we're laughing with you
