MY OLD MAN

Here we are, come see us driving in your car.
In the morning's dim, break it off with him.
You said something there. Something throws me from my chair.
I refuse to talk this hour, 'cause I don't need this now.
You're a sure thing, but I know
I don't need this now.

You're an old friend we both know
I could take you out.
And last night I did something that I don't wanna hear.
Bring your sister out, we'll be leaving now.
And I punched upset, and it's buzzing in my ear.
Bring your sister out, we'll be leaving now.

You're a sure thing but I know
You can count me out.
You're an old friend. We both know
I could take you out.

I see it now. I see it slow, I see it now. I see it now.

Here we are, come see us filing in my car and take a spin
Break it off with him.
He says something there. Something throws me from my chair.
Bring your sister out, we'll be leaving now.

You're a sure thing but I know
You can count me out.
You're an old friend. We both know
I could take you out.
