FRENCH VACATION

Ive left my friend 
of drinking in on time 
but he never showed up 
but he speaks french he's fine
and I'm..

where did you go;
where did you go
I should have known 
I should have known
hey I'm glad you've finally cought up
just go get a lounge;
been drank on my own
hey whered you go?

hey where'd you go?
I remember when all our plans were to meet at home
where'd you go?
where'd you go?
