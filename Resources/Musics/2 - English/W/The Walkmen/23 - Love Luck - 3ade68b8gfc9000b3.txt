LOVE LUCK

Another face, gone is the world of mystery,
The slaughter that is gonna stay that way.
One man he whips, one man is dancing to his grave,
Who do I follow, who do I play?

You can't deny it, the ports are all
You can't deny it, the road is long

After the fun, after all the bubble gum
There is no swinging left on my charm
After the fun, after all the bubble gum
There is no swinging left on my charm

You can't deny it, the ports are all
You cant deny it, the road is long

This love is luck(x7)
