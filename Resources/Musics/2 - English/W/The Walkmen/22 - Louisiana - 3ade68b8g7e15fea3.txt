LOUISIANA

Louisiana
Come go away with me
We'll take the highway
I'll see you in between
I listen to my head
I never would have come
It's been two days without it
The sleeping in the sun 
Hey

Crossing through Tennessee watching the sunrise
Thinking about a dream
Well we'll listen all night
To the footsteps in the hall
There's thunder and there's lightening
A hundred miles off

I got my hands full all summer long
I got my hands full
I got my hands
full

Louisiana
Come go away with me
Drinking our coffee
Under the canopy
Never saw a morning
I slept through half a day
There's thunder and there's lightening
A hundred miles away
Oh

I got my hands full most of the time
I got my hands full
I got my hands

Da da da da da
Da da da da da
