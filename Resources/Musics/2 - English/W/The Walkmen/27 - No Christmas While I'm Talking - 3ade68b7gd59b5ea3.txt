NO CHRISTMAS WHILE I'M TALKING

When I was told
you lied to me
I hung my head in shame.
When I was told
you were cheating me
I bet my love in pain.

So back up,
back away.
and you better know now,
just for a little while,
do it one more time,
just for a little while.

Oh, back up,
back far away.
and you better know
just for a little while,
do it one more time,
just for a little while.
