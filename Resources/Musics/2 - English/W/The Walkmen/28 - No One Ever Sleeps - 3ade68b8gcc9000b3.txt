NO ONE EVER SLEEPS

See the yards, tender goats
Up in wonder for you know
Can't continue on this way
No one ever sleeps.

Here minds, laughing faces
Sing of our love and hate
Can't continue on this way
No one ever sleeps, no one ever sleeps.

See the wallets time and go
Up In wonder for you know
Can't remember all the stuff
To show.

No one ever sleeps.
