ROLL DOWN THE LINE

What I needed most,
I needed binds
And strangles with regret but still comes so easily.
Where'd you go?
Tonight I woke to find you gone.

The question and, and answer that sounded off.
The glance goes abject enough.
When she was young, she asked me if
I knew here well
I thought I did.
I know better now.
And I have holes
I have binds.
It strangles with regret, but still comes so easily.
The question and, and answer that sounds.
That glance goes abject, cut off.
An answer cut off.
