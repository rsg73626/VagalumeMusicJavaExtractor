ALL MY GREAT DESIGNS

Well I've been hearing things
Voices carry over water
Things I can't deny
Night after night
Night after night after night

My broken heart

You will know when you've been running around
You will know when you've been out on your own
It will haunt you night after night
Haunt you night after night

Well I've been seeing things
Lights are shining through my eyelids
All the great designs
Never make it out of my sleep

You will know when you've been running around
You will know when you've been out on your own
It will haunt you night after night
You can't hide what you know night after night
