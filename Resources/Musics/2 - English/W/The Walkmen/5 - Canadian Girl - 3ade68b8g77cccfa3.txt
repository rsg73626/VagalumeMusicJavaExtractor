CANADIAN GIRL

You are the morning
I am the night
I was the only one
Left at the right time

And only I…
…Still call you mine
Only I….
…Still hanging on

Blown by a strong wind
But it we feared
All that you said to me
Is still so very clear

So take my hand
All the players in the band
They can always find
Always find some number that we know

You will be asleep
When I go
And the happy the news
It will carry on
You are the morning
I am the night
I was the only one
Left at the right time

And only I..
…Still call you mine
Only I…
…Still hanging on
