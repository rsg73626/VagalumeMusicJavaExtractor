HEARTBREAKER

I have no business asking you the words
I know the reason you exaggerate
I know the answers to all your demands
I have no secrets.

I'm not your heartbreaker, some tender ballet play
I'm not your heartbreaker.

These are the good years, are the best we'll ever know
This golden light years.

I'm not your heartbreaker, some tender ballet play,
I'm not your heartbreaker.

You know I'm hopeless,
Oh no, I know you're all wrong
It's not the singer, it's the song
You know I'm helpless
Oh no, no, you're all wrong
It's not the singer, it's the song.

On these short days like the Chinese stars
Let's dance in our uniforms
These are the good years, are the best we'll ever know
This golden light years.

I'm not your heartbreaker, some tender ballet play
I'm not your heartbreaker.
I'm not your heartbreaker, some tender ballet play
I'm not your heartbreaker.
I'm not your heartbreaker.
