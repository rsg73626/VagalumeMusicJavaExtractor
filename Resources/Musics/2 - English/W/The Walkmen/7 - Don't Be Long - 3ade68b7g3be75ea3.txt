DON'T BE LONG

Don't be long so I hear
From her mouth as she's going on
On and on as the land's shaking.
Hey now, don't look so upset.
Hey now, let's get out of bed.
Gone on, gone on, let yourself out and don't call me again if your arm's twisted
Hey now, don't look so upset.
Hey now, let's go get dressed.
You say that's all, where'd â€¦
And it's way too familiar
You say don't go, no and no,
You were placing a prank call
Working an angle.
