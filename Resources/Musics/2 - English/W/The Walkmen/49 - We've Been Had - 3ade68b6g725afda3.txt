WE'VE BEEN HAD

Well I'm a modern guy I don't care much for the go-go 
or the retro image I see so often telling me to 
keep trying maybe you'll get here someday 
keep up the working, ok
I close the book on them right there 

I see myself change as the days change over 
I hear the songs and the words don't change 
I write them out of the book right there

We've been had, you say it's over 
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older 
We've been had I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud 

See me age 19 with some dumb haircut from 
1960 moving to New York City 
live with my friends there we're all taking the same steps
they're foolish now 

We've been had you say it's over 
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older 
We've been had I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud
