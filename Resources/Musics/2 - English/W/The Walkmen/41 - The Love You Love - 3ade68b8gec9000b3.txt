THE LOVE YOU LOVE

You don't love me, just a kissing
Don't judge the preface, just the fiction
I'll take the fiction, I'll take the fiction.

Where we are and where we should be
Playing the one you're trying to be
Where we are and where we should be
Baby, it's the love you love,
Baby it's the love you love,
Not me
Baby, it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you love

I wanna stay up all night again
I wanna work hard, don't wanna play again
Don't wanna

Where we are and where we should be
Playing the one you're trying to be
Where we are and where we should be
Baby, it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you love
Not me.
Baby it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you love.
