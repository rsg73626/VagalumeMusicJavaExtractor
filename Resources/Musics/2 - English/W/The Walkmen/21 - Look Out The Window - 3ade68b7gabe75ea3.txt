LOOK OUT THE WINDOW

Broken hearted, don't get me started.
That's no way to greet someone.
So quit that laugh and give me some action.
I'm so bored of all these days and all these lonely drawn out ways
I keep indoors and I can't wait to see so far or wake up tomorrow.
We'll go out to look for you. So
Why don't you ever come back home?
I know you're having so much fun.
These days I'm standing all alone.
Just don't forget this one.

Lots of love and X's and O's. That
Envelope had opened up.
I saw inside and don't try to hide it.
I know what you think of me.

Why don't you ever come back home?
I know you're having so much fun.
These days I'm spending all alone.
Just don't forget this one, no.

And it's not like the world goes around you,
Coming thru the window here.
Don't forget that no one is beside you.
So, for now, you're on your own.
