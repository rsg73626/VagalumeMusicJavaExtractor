WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME

What's in it for me x2
I came here for a good time and you're telling me to leave
but you don't have to say it again, I heard you the first time 

We're counting on you x2
well I like to remember it like that
When we had one in the hand, that was one in the hand
but you never come over any more 

So you don't have to say it again, I heard you the first time
