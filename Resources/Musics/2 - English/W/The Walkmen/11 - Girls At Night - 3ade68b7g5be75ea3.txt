GIRLS AT NIGHT

You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number
I know
We've been through this before
Can't you hear me?
I'm pounding on the wall

When I used to go out I knew everyone I saw
Now I go out alone if I go out at all
I know
We've been through this before
Can't you hear me?
I'm beating at your door
