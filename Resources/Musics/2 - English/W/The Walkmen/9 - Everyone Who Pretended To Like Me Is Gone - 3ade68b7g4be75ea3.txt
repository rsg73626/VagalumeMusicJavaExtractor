EVERYONE WHO PRETENDED TO LIKE ME IS GONE

because he knows
our romeo
he can't climb back
he swings in loopholes
when he goes through the air
their vengeance will stretch out

i made the best of it

this velvet rope
has fell before
in vain
clothing crashing the floor
insane
worse than once thought

i made the best of it
