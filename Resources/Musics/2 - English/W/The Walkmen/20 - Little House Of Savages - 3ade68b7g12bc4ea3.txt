LITTLE HOUSE OF SAVAGES

Somebody's waiting for me at home 
Somebody's waiting for me at home 
I should've known 
I should've known 

And somebody's got a car outside 
Somebody's got a car outside 
Let's take a ride 
Let's take a ride 

And somebody's waiting for me at home 
Somebody's waiting for me at home 
I should've known 
I should've known 

Here we go! 

And somebody's got a car outside 
Somebody's got a car outside 
Let's take a ride 

And noone is waiting for the girl 
Wanna go 
Somebody's waiting for me at home 
I should've told 
I should've told 

'Cause you can run and have your fun 
But don't come around when she gets home 

Oh, ba-by - don't - go home 

There's a door in my heart 
And it's open tonight 
Come on in and I got you tonight 
I should've told 
I should've told 

'Cause you can run and have your fun 
But don't come around when she gets home...
