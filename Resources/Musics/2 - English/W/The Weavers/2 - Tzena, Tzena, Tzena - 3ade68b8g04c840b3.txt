Can't you hear the music playing in the village square?
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Can't you hear the music playing in the village square?
Tzena, Tzena, join the celebration
There'll be people there from every nation
Dawn will find us dancing in the sunlight
Dancing in the village square

Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
How can anything plainer than my love for you?
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Don't you know your eyes contain a look that thrills me through?
Tzena, Tzena, everyone is waiting
For a wedding they're anticipating
Everyone is happy celebrating
People dancing in the streets

Clap your hands and (clap)
Raise your voices higher
Make a circle
While we dance around the fire
All the world's in
Love with Tze-na, Tze-na

Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Come into the fields and we'll begin to work the land
Hoeing, sowing, new things growing
Pioneering all together, come and lend a hand
Tzena, Tzena building a new nation
Toiling busily all day
Soon we'll dance and have a celebration
But first we'll work and then we'll play
Tzena, Tzena
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, TZENA!
