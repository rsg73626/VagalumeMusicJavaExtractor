LOVE AT IT'S BEST

Talk
You know it's kinda hard to give up a love
That really turns you on, hey, hey
Kinda love that makes you strong
But oh sometimes
You just don't know doubt
You just keep hanging in there
Because love means that much, hey, hey listen

I never thought that I could possibly care
We were supposed to enjoy a simple love affair
(Ooh, ooh, oh)
But how unkind it is to put me in a spin
'Cause you've gone away and look at the trouble I'm in
Now that I've had love at it's best
I can't live with anything less
Now that I know how it ought to be
No other love does it for me

So many times it's just the same old routine
(Same old, same old)
I go through the motions but it don't mean a thing no, no, no
I start to fall in love and stop to compare
Halfway to heaven I know I'm not gonna make it there

Now that I've had love at it's best
I can't live with anything less
Now that I know how it ought to be
No other love does it for me
I used to have list when I was feeling bad, baby
I could just dial a kiss but oh its lips so sad

Now that I've had love at it's best
I can't live with anything less
Now that I know how it ought to be
No other love does it for me
Now that I know how it ought to be
No other love does it for me
Now that I've had love at it's best
I don't wanna live with anything less
