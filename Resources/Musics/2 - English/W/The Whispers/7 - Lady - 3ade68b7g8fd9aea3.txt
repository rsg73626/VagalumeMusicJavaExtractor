LADY

You say you love me lady
Girl i hope you do
Only you can save me
My life equals you
Kiss me drive me crazy
Would you do that for me lady

(Lady) You say you want my babies
Girl if that's a fact
(Lady)Then melt into me lady
As though we were wax
(Oooooh) Erase all my maybes
Would you do that for me lady

Oh, your body's designed
By the wisdom of time
And i couldn't live without you
Without losing my mind
The answer to the press
And just like fresh air
You keep me alive
You cannot be spared
Don't you ever go nowhere
Ya see I love you lady
Really, really love you girl
And no power, no power baby, can keep us apart
Your engraved in my heart
