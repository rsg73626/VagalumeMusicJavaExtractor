ROCK STEADY

I Looked At You 
You Stole My Heart 
You Were All That I Anticipated 
I Wanted You -- Every Part But I Knew That Love Would Be Complicated 
I Began to Touch -- But You Wouldnt Let It 
It Never Seemed to Be the Right Time 
I Started to Give Up -- Down to the Limit 
And Then You Changed Your Mind 

Chorus 
And We Begin to Rock Steady 
Steady Rockin All Night Long 
And We Begin to Rock Steady 
Rockin Till the Break of Dawn 

You Looked At Me to My Surprise 
You Were Through Anticipating 
I Should Have Known -- It Was in Your Eyes 
That You Were Gettin Tired of Waiting 
You Wanted Me So Much -- But I Didnt Get It 
How Could a Fellow Be So Blind? 
I Started to Give Up -- But Love Wouldnt Let It 
Then You Walked Into My Life 

Chorus 

You Wanted Me So Much -- But I Didnt Get It 
How Could a Fellow Be So Blind? 
Started to Give Up -- But Love Wouldnt Let It 
And You Walked Into My Life 

Chorus
