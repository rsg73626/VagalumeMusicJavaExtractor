SELF DESTRUCT

A time bomb ready to explode
Said I was too young, too Immature
I'm not like you and that's for sure
You burned your friends and now you're fucked
No one is there when you self destruct

Nowhere to run, you lose
Where'd you go, back against the fuckin' wall
Nowhere to hide, you'e outta luck
You fucked this up, you fucked this up...
Self destruct you lose...
You turned your back on me
For some drunken fantasy
You realize now that you are fucked
You lost your friends, you self destruct
