NOT ALONE

Well I’m not like you
And you’re not like me, but trust me that’s alright
It’s alright for me…The differences we have
Set us apart, and my thoughts they are all mine
And you can’t take them away
So insecure
It f-f-fades away, to nothing so they say
So quickly…Your youth didn’t stand a chance
It’s all we got…The hall shows and the basements
Where we play…while the debt keeps piling on
And we wouldn’t change a thing…Not Now!

And we’re not alone…NO, NO I KNOW WE’RE NOT ALONE
It’s in our hearts, it’s in out souls…
NO, NO I KNOW WE’RE NOT ALONE
The youth is ours you can’t control…
NO, NO I KNOW WE’RE NOT ALONE
We’re not alone, We’re not alone…WE’RE NOT ALONE

Head over heels…We stage dive to feel alive
Admit to yourself…You grew up way to fast
And passed it off…The old shit in our heart
As a waste of time…And you can kiss my ass
I guess we’ll drift apart…
To bad…

Just swallow hard…It’s so hard to accept your gone
What about the past…competition got the best
Got the best of you…You said no regrets
No regrets for our youth…But I guess you changed your tune
We’re stuck in this grown up rut…Any questions?
At least we lived

And we’re not alone…NO, NO I KNOW WE’RE NOT ALONE
It’s in our hearts, it’s in out souls…
NO, NO I KNOW WE’RE NOT ALONE
The youth is ours you can’t control…
NO, NO I KNOW WE’RE NOT ALONE
We’re not alone, We’re not alone…WE’RE NOT ALONE
