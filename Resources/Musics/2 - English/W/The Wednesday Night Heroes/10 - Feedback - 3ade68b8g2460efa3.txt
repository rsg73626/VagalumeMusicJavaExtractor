Jump in the van and let's all go
Where we're headed who the fuck knows.
Sick of the regular life it's time to break free.
Got no money but that's ok
Met some good friends along the way.
Sick of the regular life it's time to break free.

But I'll drive, I'll fuckin' drive so hard to see
That I won't stand in my station I gotta break free
I'm thinkin' with my heart and the future's out of reach
So cheers to you...for all those memories

Don't know where we're headed, but that's all right
Another fun show, another fucked up night
Sick of the regular life, it's time to break free
Pizza shit destroyed the stall,
I love fuckin' tourin' and I want it all
Sick of the regular life it's time to break free
...sick of everyday time to break free...
