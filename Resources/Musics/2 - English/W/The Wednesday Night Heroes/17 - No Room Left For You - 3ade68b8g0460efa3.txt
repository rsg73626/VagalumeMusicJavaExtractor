NO ROOM LEFT FOR YOU

I'm just tryin' to satisfy,
Satisfy the fire that burns inside of me
I'm so sick of working,
I work so hard it takes its toll on me
Out of work, stay out late
With my friends, ain't got no dates
But with not much to do, where'd everybody go?
There's no more fuckin' shows!

C'mon, c'mon, there's no room left for you
C'mon, c'mon, there's no room left for you
Come on, there's no room left for you
Come on, come on... there's better things to do

I'm just tired of sulkin',
Sulkin' hard cause there is nowhere left to play
I'm so sick of hopin'
I hope so hard that things are going to change
No more shows, no halls left.
We fucked it up what do you expect
All the memories, all the shows
Where'd everyone go? no more fuckin' shows

They said... what about tomorrow
You know we fucked up... no more shows
But we said, we'll find a way
To bust out the tunes, cause there's no room left for you
