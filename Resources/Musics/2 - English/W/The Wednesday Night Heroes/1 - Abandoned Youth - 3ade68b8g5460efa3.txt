ABANDONED YOUTH

Abandoned youth on the streets...
We're not perfect, but we're sure not obsolete
Stop shoving your slogans down our throats...
I'll do things my way, I'll decide me destiny
Take a stand, but lighten up cause no ones listening!
What's cool for you, may not be for me
And maybe, we're changing, you and me are not the same...

Abandoned youth, abandoned youth
And I don't wanna be like you
We may freeze in the cold, but let's go for the gold
Cause abandoned youth ain't got nowhere to go!

Abandoned youth in the scene...
You know it's cool with kids thinking independently
You put them down for being free...
Because they don't believe in everything that you believe
