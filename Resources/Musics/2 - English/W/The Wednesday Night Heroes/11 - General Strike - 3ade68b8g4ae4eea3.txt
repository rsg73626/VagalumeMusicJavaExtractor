GENERAL STRIKE

Living in the city, it sux cuz you go to work everyday and sometimes every night
But that's alright when you got a job you don't like...
that's alright. Cuz we'll go and do a general strike.
Why do you work in a job that you know you hate
You're always stuck working nine to five
Why do you work for a boss that you know you hate
You wanna kick his ass and you'll feel alright...
You only do this to survive

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh its a general strike for us [x3]
I got amibiton you know im going to turn out right

I don't give a shit about the kids that try to bring
me down, Cuz I work and still have a life. But
everyday I go to work and realize that something ain't
right. So I go and join a general strike.
Why do you work in a job that you know you hate
You're always stuck working nine to five
Why do you work for a boss that you know you hate
You wanna kick his ass and you'll feel alright...
You only do this to survive
