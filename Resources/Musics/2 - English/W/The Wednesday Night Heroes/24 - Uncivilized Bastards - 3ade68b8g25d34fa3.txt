UNCIVILIZED BASTARDS

I paid my dues, the checks in the mail
When I walk downtown, everything's so stale
I've got a job, yet you treat me like a bum
Everywhere I go, I'm a walking disaster
I'm bulletproof...your words, they don't go though
Whatcha gonna do...when I turn around and spit on you
Spit on you like some uncivilized bastard

WE ARE
UNCIVILIZED
BASTARDS
We are the uncivilized bastards
[x2]

They call us scum, but they are the ones to blame
To certain cops we're not treated the same
When I walk by cops, I watch over my back
Cause they can't be trusted, no not by me.
I'm bulletproof...your badge don't mean shit
Whatcha gonna do...when I totally disregard you
And flip you off like an uncivilized bastard

WE ARE
UNCIVILIZED
BASTARDS
We are the uncivilized bastards
[x2]

Stand up and have a say
We won't be treated this way
Our voice is getting stronger
And the nights get longer
Fucked up when sirens pass
You say we've got no class
Monday morning we'll start all over
While Friday night we're uncivilized bastards

We are...We are...We are...We are...We are...We are...We are...
We are the uncivilized bastards!

WE ARE
UNCIVILIZED
BASTARDS
We are the uncivilized bastards
