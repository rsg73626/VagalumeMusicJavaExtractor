KNOCK US DOWN

They say the powers on the streets
But that's just news to us
Cause it seems like what we do
Is controlled by the higher ups
If I had my way we'd all bust free
We'd all rise above and change this society.

They knock us down, but we never budged, we won't blow down.
Try, try, try, and try again... to knock us down
We'll rise above...

I feel like a mouse, running aimless in a maze
One too many pieces, in this big chess game.
We must break out from this media sensation
I feel alien to my generation

Knock us down, knock us down... here we stand with thousands
Knock us down, knock us down...rise up, rise above
