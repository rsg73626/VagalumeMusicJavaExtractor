HATED N' PROUD

I'm so sick and tired
Don't wanna take it any more
Something's gotta give
We are kicking down the door
Take a full step back
We are sick of all your shit
Ain't no way we're leaving
Don't you know we'll never fucking quit
You talk your shit I still believe

We're the heroes, we're not second best
They try to turn us down but we're still the loudest tonight
We're the heroes, we're not second best
They say we're hated but we're still the proudest tonight

We're the heroes, we're not second best

We're so hated n' proud!
