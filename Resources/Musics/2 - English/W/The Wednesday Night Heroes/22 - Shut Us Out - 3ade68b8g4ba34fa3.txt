SHUT US OUT

At this show just feeling fine
Kids outside drinking bags of win
Pretty smooth as far as hall shows go
But it went to hell when the pigs all showed

Shut us out…Shut us out
Shut us out or shut us up, but you can never shut us down

The Riot begins begin to play
Kids take turns jumping off the stage
No one got hurt, no fights ‘n crap
Cops prepare for a gas attack

Shut us out…Shut us out
Shut us out or shut us up, but you can never shut us down
[x2]

During the set a kink in the fun
The powers off the lights are on
Bullshit cops thought they’d won
Kids kept singing united as one

Shut us out…Shut us out
Shut us out or shut us up, but you can never shut us down
