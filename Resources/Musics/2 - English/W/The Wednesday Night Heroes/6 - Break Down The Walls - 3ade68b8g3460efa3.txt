BREAK DOWN THE WALLS

You can't fight desperation
Behind plastic shields
Clear the way, clear the way
Clear the way, clear the way
See the shards of the broken glass
From your foundation
Breakin' down, it's breakin' down
Breakin' down, it's breakin' down

Beat us down, lock us up... we'll keep fighting
Break down the walls
We will succeed when you come crashing down...break it!
Beat us down, lock us up... we'll keep fighting
Break down the walls
I'm tired of this system let's show them all
...Break down the walls!

Is this class separation
Tearing us apart?
Fenced in, locked out
Fenced in, locked out
Scratch beneath the surface
To uncover their lies
Smash it up, you smash it up
Smash it up, let's smash it up

Wake up, wake up
It's time to be aware we got a shake up
Wake up, wake up
A better way of life for me and you...
