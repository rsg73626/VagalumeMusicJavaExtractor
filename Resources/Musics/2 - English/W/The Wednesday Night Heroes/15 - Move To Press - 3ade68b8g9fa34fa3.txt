MOVE TO PRESS

Let’s go…We’ve got work to do
Let’s go…All you chosen few
With our words we will strike
Don’t need you to set things right
No more…Media in control
No more…Lies, stats and polls
Reading trendy magazines
Lazy writer’s fuckin’ up the scene…No!

MOVE, MOVE, MOVE… Destruction of the underground
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE… You’ve got a voice why don’t you write it down
MOVE TO PRESS, MOVE TO PRESS…For the truth
Don’t let them dictate what’s best for you
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE…Please don’t be complacent
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE… And don’t fuckin’ waste it
MOVE TO PRESS, MOVE TO PRESS FOR THE TRUTH
Don’t let them dictate what’s best for you!

It’s up to us, its up to us its up to fuckin' us
Over generalized point of view
Continues fucked up news
We’ve got…to make a difference
We’ve got…to stop this bullshit
The zines should be written by us
By the kids that we trust…NOW!

MOVE, MOVE, MOVE… Destruction of the underground
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE… You’ve got a voice why don’t you write it down
MOVE TO PRESS, MOVE TO PRESS…For the truth
Don’t let what they write dictate what’s best for you
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE…Please don’t be complacent
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE… And don’t fuckin’ waste it
MOVE TO PRESS, MOVE TO PRESS FOR THE TRUTH

What the fuck!

Move to press, everybody move to [x8]
Move to press [x10]
