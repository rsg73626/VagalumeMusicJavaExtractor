BLAND NEW AGE

…IT’S A BLAND NEW AGE
Killing the dream, killing the dream…
Package cliché it all SOUNDS THE SAME
Standing asleep, Standing asleep…
Eyes glassed over by your T.V. SCREEN
Marketing and research, it’s all dollars and cents
Mass produce rebellion in this bland new age
Zombified by T.V like a science fiction movie
Selling state slogans to make a name

Wake up…it sucks…We’re Stuck…NO WAY
Wake up…it sucks…We’re Stuck…NO WAY
Wake up…There’s no…Escape
DAWN OF A BLAND NEW AGE

Killing the dream, killing the dream…
Package cliché it all SOUNDS THE SAME
Standing asleep, Standing asleep…
Eyes glassed over by your T.V. SCREEN
Using DIY and dogma, you’re a cut above the rest
Nothing’s achieving we’re back to square one
Dis this, Dis that, Dis image to protect
With the fear of being judged, where’s the fun?

Wake up…it sucks…We’re Stuck…NO WAY
Wake up…it sucks…We’re Stuck…NO WAY
Wake up…There’s no…Escape
DAWN OF A BLAND NEW AGE

This song has been played…IN A BLAND NEW AGE
This song has been played…IN A BLAND NEW AGE
Just think what we could have been…IN A BLAND NEW AGE
Fuck it…is there room for change…IN A BLAND NEW AGE
NO!

BLAND NEW AGE!
