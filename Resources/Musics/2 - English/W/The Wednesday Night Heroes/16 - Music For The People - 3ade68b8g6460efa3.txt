MUSIC FOR THE PEOPLE

This is music for the people,
This is the music for the people.
Nothing more, nothing less,
We tip our hats to bands that give it their best
I hope that you will understand, if not we'll make you understand
To me punk music is real,
It's the energy thats the appeal.
You may be old school but that means dick
Times are changing, we're the new breed!

Yes we've got a problem and I guess that problem's you.
So don't you act so clueless cause I'm sure you always knew...
Just what you've put us through

This is music for the people,
This is the music for the people
I'm tired of meaningless songs, bootfuck Celine Dion
I hope that you will understand, if not we'll make you understand
Goin' south to find good bands?
That's something I will never understand
Our nations run by the radio,
It's so fucked up, its so fucking slow

This is music for the people,
This is the music for the people
This goes out to all the punks and skins
For giving us something to believe in.
I hope that you will understand, if not we'll make you understand
Rock stars I can't relate,
They say they're true when we know they're fake.
Our nations run by the radio,
It's so fucked up, its so fucking slow
