ACTION

1,2
Fucked youth aren’t wanted around here
They call you fag cause you charge your hair…AGAIN
IN CRUDE city rednecks patrol the streets
Beat you down when they think you’re a freak…AGAIN

Stand and be counted cause you’re vicious and loud
Stand and be counted cause you’re proud
Paid the price for their satisfaction, throwing down even though…
I’m not looking for action [x2]
Now I gotta go to war [x2]

Whyte Ave used to be a great place
Now overrun by pavement apes…THEY SAY
NO WAY out, nowhere left, nowhere to run
Redneck cops gonna have their fun on you…AND ON YOU

Stand and be counted cause you’re vicious and loud
Stand and be counted cause you’re proud
Paid the price for their satisfaction, throwing down even though…
I’m not looking for action [x2]
Now I gotta go to war [x2]

I’m not looking for action [x2]
Now I gotta go to war [x2]

For their fun-You paid the price
Their fun-You paid the price
In self defense…WE’LL GET EVEN SOON

For their fun, For their fun
In self defense…WE’LL GET EVEN SOON
Well get even soon

I’m not looking for action [x16]
Now I gotta to war…Yeah!
