ANOTHER WASTED NIGHT

Staring at the Tv screen...another fuckin wasted night
Next thing I know I fell asleep...another fuckin wasted night
Holy shit I gotta go...another fuckin wasted night
Before I miss the goddamn show...another fuckin wasted night

No! Time's up. I slept in. You bastards. You saw the show.

Putting on my socks I slip and fall
I stumble through my apartment hall
I heard last week new town (animals) were great
I wouldn't know, cause I was late

Running fast down the street
I see the club, I hear the beats
Sign says five bucks to see the show
I left my fuckin wallet at home
