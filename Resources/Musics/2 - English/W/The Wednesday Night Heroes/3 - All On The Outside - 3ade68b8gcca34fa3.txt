ALL ON THE OUTSIDE

Just flip the switch for the new sensation
Or flip it off for punk of the streets (and they say)
WE STAND…OUTSIDE…Won’t be like them
WE STAND…OUTSIDE…Like we give a shit

Better get back to the factory
Poisonous gas is killing me…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
Watch them come, watch them fall
Read the writing on the wall…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE

Full speed ahead in the wrong direction
Why we wake up now from this fantasy (and they say)
WE STAND…OUTSIDE…never be like them
WE STAND…OUTSIDE…Like we give a fuck

Better get back to the factory
Poisonous gas is killing me…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
Watch them come, watch them fall
Read the writing on the wall…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE

Like this…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
We stand…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE 

When they say streetpunk’s through
Just look’ em down and say fuck you

We stand…ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
ALL ON THE OUTSIDE…from you
ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
Watch them come, watch them fall
Read the writing on wall
(don’t know line please add)

When they say streetpunk’s through
Just look’ em down and say fuck you
