WE WANT THE TRUTH

(Question everything the media has to say)
We Want
The Truth
We want the truth!

We want the truth, this ain't no Pc scheme
We've got to find what's goin' on behind the scenes
The news we get, completely full of fuckin' lies.
They say it's fine. nothing's wrong. everything's fine

I'm pissed and sick of all the mainstream shit.
Its just a way to cover up the real threat.
This ain't a dis to our brothers from the south
I'm just so sick of being pushed around.

We want the truth... we'll take a stand with no delay
We want the truth... your lies won't go away
We want the truth... there's got to be some better days
We want the truth... we won't go away!!
