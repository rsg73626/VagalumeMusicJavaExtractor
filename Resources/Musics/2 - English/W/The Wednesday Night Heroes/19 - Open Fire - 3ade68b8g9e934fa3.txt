OPEN FIRE

It's like... Screaming while tied to a rack
You keep talk, talking back
Too many obstacles in my path
Up against the wall...OPEN FIRE
Break glass and spray paint the walls
It's time to grow some fucking balls
We're at war against them all
Up against the wall...OPEN FIRE

Who are you to look down on me? OPEN FIRE 
The Firing squad's taking aim...OPEN FIRE
In a Blindfold we look the same...OPEN FIRE
Yeah!!!!! OPEN FIRE!!!!!!!!

There's Panic, panic in the streets
There's Panic, panic in the homes
There's panic everywhere we go
Up against the wall... OPEN FIRE
You're laughing, laughing at me
But you + me = we
We're in search of unity
Up against the wall... OPEN FIRE

Who are you to look down on me? OPEN FIRE 
The Firing squad's taking aim...OPEN FIRE
In a Blindfold we look the same...OPEN FIRE
Yeah!!!!! OPEN FIRE!!!!!!!!

Ready, Aim, Fire!
Up against the wall, Up against the wall
Put the blindfold on, put the blindfold on.
Fire... You can't control me
Firing squads in front of me
Firing squads in front of me
Up against the wall, Up against the wall
Put the blindfold on, put the blindfold on.
OPEN FIRE, OPEN FIRE, OPEN FIRE, OPEN FIRE
OPEN FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!
