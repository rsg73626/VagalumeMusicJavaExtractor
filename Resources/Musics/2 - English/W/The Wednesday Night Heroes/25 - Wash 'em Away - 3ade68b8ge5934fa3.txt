WASH 'EM AWAY

Can't sleep, tired all the time
With nightmares lurking in my mind
Need help, but get pushed away
A nuclear blast every fucking day
I got my friends just to keep me sane
With a war raging inside my brain
Boxed malls where I used to live
Now I get washed away, oh shit!

Too bad is what they say
Tough streets made you that way
No escape from a ticking bomb
Red alert, the primer's on
I wanna help, but I don't know how
I can't seem to grasp that now
Urban rot, Human Decay
Now I get washed away

Washed out, washed up
A too bad never saved yourself
Washed out, washed up
Today, we must do something now
[x2]

Too bad never saved yourself... Wash 'em away [x8]
Too bad...never saved yourself!!!

Washed out, washed up
A too bad never saved yourself
Washed out, washed up
Today, we must do something now
[x2]
