DEAD END STREET

Here we go!
Got home still living in a suitcase
Kick back, throw on Blitz's "New Age"
Doin' it for the kids on the street
Head out, looking for escape
No luck, maybe that's just fate
We're on a dead end pace!

We're gonna set this night
We're gonna set this night on fire
We won't look back, {when} we begin to tire
We know a fire burns but all we can do
Is stick together and...

Live life...thought of an escape
Tough luck...back to the last round
Get fucked...at least I'm living
Living on a dead end street
[x2]

Hard times, hard lines, hard luck
Don't tire when times get tough
Don't get caught in the game
What game? Please stop crying
Fuck off at least we're trying
Believe a change will be made

We're gonna set this night
We're gonna set this night on fire
We won't look back, {when} we begin to tire
We know a fire burns but all we can do
Is stick together and...

Live life...thought of an escape
Tough luck...back to the last round
Get fucked...at least I'm living
Living on a dead end street
[x2]

Livin' on, we're livin' on, we're livin' on a dead end, dead end street [x3]
We're on the street, dead end street

A dead end street
We're livin' on a dead end street
