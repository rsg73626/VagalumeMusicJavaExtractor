HOW FAR YOU'VE COME

You'd have a wonderful day
If you could see how lucky you are
Now don't get carried away with your heart
You're better where you are

You're not the only one 
Who's fair to hang on to a moving star
Now don't be sorry, what's done now is done
And this is who you are

These days feel numbered and long 
There's no one to speak of, there's no one at all
But you're not the reason that everyone's gone
That's not how they are

There is no system to change 
No conditions are made, no permissions to start
Now don't go drawing lines in the sand
That's not who you are

Sometimes a high wall is just a wall
Sometimes it's only there to make sure you feel small
But maybe that'll save you
From the depths of a musty performance

The truth will not set you free
It's okay to believe that you're not good enough
God is not angry, not blind, deaf, or dumb
He knows how far you've come
He knows how far you've come
He knows how far you've come
