IT WON'T BE LONG (TILL WE'RE NOT WRONG ANYMORE)

You said the words I want to hear
They don't begin with the letter I
They don't include pity revisions of lies
They don't end with asking me why
It's not like the movies are
Where they hand you a set of lines
There are no excuses do overs in life
It's one chance for getting it right

Just say it won't
It won't be long
Till we're not
Wrong anymore

Have you not learned a thing at all
Have you not grown a little wise
Say something's working in the back of your mind
Something worthy of taking its time
The message it has been sent
There's no more roses on this vine
I've given you everything you've got
And a little more than a sign

Just say it won't
Won't be long
Till we're not
Wrong anymore

No you don't have to make sense
But it is good to be clear
Are you thinking
Are thinking of something
Speak up be aware
You're not the only one that's got my ear

Just say that it won't
It won't be long
Till we're not
We're not wrong anymore
Just say that it won't
It won't be long
Till we're not
We're not wrong anymore

You said the words I want to hear
They don't begin with the letter I
