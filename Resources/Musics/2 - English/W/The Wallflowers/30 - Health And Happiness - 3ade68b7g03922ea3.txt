HEALTH AND HAPPINESS

Maybe it's not
That I don't care anymore
Maybe I just never did
You can't say 
That I have ever lied
Because I keep the truth well hid
Tell me what's wrong
Is something wrong?
You can't be sad
When something you have never had
Suddenly feels gone

I wish you health 
I wish happiness 
But absolutely nothing else

I'm not here to keep an eye on you
I think you misunderstood
I could make things easy for you
I won't 
But I could
Does that make you sad?
Cause you look sad
You should be glad
For what you've had
And don't feel bad
I could wish less for you

I wish you health 
I wish you happiness
But absolutely nothing else

There is no distance here
To get across
There's nothing to grip

Or get a hold
The emptiness you feel
Is nothing at all
Now nobody broke any bones
It could be worse
Yeah, it can get worse
You've got your strength
And you have got your health
You should be worried 'bout
Somebody else

(chorus)
