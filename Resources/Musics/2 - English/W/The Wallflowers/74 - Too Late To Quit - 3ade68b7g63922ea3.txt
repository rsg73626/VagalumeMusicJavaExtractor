TOO LATE TO QUIT

Takes all my might
To find a hole that feels right
To bury myself
In a deep sleep at night
I hear a voice
Coming from the hillside
Says I'll show you the way
I will show you the light

But I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm much too tired
I'm tired

He's says I know where you were headed
And you're half way there
But you've got to be careful
You've got to beware
Some people want to hurt you
Some people don't care
But I'm never gonna give you
Any more than you can bore
(chorus)

There's nothing left here to rise above
We're not talking bout' that kind of love
You;ve got people here counting on you
Now's a good time
To learn how to pull through

Sometimes a good idea
Just isn't enough
You've got to do the work
Now get your ass up
There isn't really such a thing as bad luck
Yeah, but once I shot an arrow
In the sky and it stuck
(chorus)

You've got to keep movin'
You've got to keep pushin'
You're never gonna get back
Anymore than you're givin'
Life is for the living
You've got to be willin'
A song ain't a song
Until someone starts singin'
