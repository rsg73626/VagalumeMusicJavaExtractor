SOME FLOWERS BLOOM DEAD

We didn't make it
We did not pull through
You shouldn't blame me
I don't blame you
Now what else did you think
That I would do?
Ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough

I'm so tired of waking up
Feeling bad
You haven't been the kind of place I have
Could it hurt you now
To let this pass?
Oooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
You want to make it so much harder

Now in another world
I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here
Making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead

The way you make me feel
I could collapse
An epidemic I cannot outlast
How could you feel used
When I feel trapped?
Ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough

And just as my conscience
Starts to clear
I drag the river and you're still there
The way I bring you down
Could not compare
Ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
You want to make it so much harder

Now in another world
I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here
Making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
But some flowers just bloom dead
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead

The way I sleep
This bed just can't be made
I pull the covers up around my head
Now when I think of me
I think of somebody else instead
As if it wasn't hard enough
You're gonna  make it so much harder

Now in another world
I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here
Making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers they just bloom dead
