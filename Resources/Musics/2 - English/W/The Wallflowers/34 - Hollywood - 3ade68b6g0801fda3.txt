HOLLYWOOD

You talk so loud and you talk so much
And you talk so funny
But honey, whatcha talkin' about?
Somethin' about being, bein' reimbursed
For every unregistered virus.

Drainpipes are filled up with dirty rain
And the leisure train is speeding in the diamond lane
With electricity shut off again
Leaving the night life only for the madman.

Oh my God,
They've sold Hollywood
Burned down my neighborhood
Even shot Robin Hood

An' oh my God,
I guess it was never understood
To understand motherhood
Right from wrong
And the bad from the good.

Everybody's got their own smoke screens
With personal armies for everyone in between
With plastic rifles given to every team
What a beautiful dream, even bullets have guarantees.

Oh my God,
They've sold Hollywood
Burned down my neighborhood
Even shot Robin Hood
An' oh my God,
I guess it was never understood
To understand brotherhood
Right from wrong
And the bad from the good.

There's the sweetest evil image detector,
As sweet as nectar, an overrated candy dispensor.
She don't give food to eat, or anybody anyplace to sleep
But she can tell you what you can, and what you can't create.

Oh my God,
They've sold Hollywood
Burned down my neighborhood
Even shot Robin Hood

An' oh my God,
I guess it was never understood
To understand motherhood
Right from wrong
And the bad from the good.

Oh my God,
They've sold Hollywood
Burned down my neighborhood
Even shot Robin Hood

An' oh my God,
I guess it was never understood
To understand brotherhood
Right from wrong
And the bad from the good.
