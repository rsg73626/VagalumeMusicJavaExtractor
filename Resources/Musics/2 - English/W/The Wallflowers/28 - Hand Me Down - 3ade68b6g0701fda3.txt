HAND ME DOWN

You won't ever amount to much
You won't be anyone
Now tell me what you were thinking of,
How could you think you would be enough

It's not that you have stayed too long
And it's not that you've done something wrong
It's not your fault
That you embarrass us all

You're a hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good and you look like you should
But you won't ever make us proud

You've been used by an army of kings
You've been touched by the lips of a queen
Now we've all made good use of you
But you won't be needed again

So why don't you move and let  someone else in
And make some room for a new harlequin
'Cause you  never know when
You'll disappoint us again

You're a hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good and you look like you should
But you won't ever make us proud

Now you're a hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good and look like you should
But you could never make us proud
Hand me down

Now look at you
With your worn out shoes
Living proof evolution's through
We're stuck with you
This revolution's doomed
