SIDEWALK ANNIE

She told you about it through a broken, bleeding windpipe
It shook your bones and made your life feel skin-tight.

Sidewalk Annie,
Now your coattails have come undone.
Your whisper's a scream now
Since you don't speak to anyone.

Howlin' winds could never care what she liked,
Rhythm and Blues or A Stranger in the Night
It tore up the trailer with the sounds of a howlin' wolf
The cellar was stone, even the garden was bulletproof.

Sidewalk Annie,
Now your coattails have come undone.
Your whisper's a scream now
Since you don't speak to anyone.

Little girl in your white ice skates
We've seen your face walkin' around the old school gates
With a hand on your hip, and the other one on your head
You realized it wasn't gone, but lost instead.

Sidewalk Annie,
Now your coattails have come undone.
Your whisper's a scream now
Since you don't speak to anyone.

Invested a nickel into the banks of a wishing well,
Blew out the candles and I hoped for somethin' that she could,
She could sell.

Sidewalk Annie,
Now your coattails come undone.
Your whisper's a scream now
Since you don't speak to anyone.
