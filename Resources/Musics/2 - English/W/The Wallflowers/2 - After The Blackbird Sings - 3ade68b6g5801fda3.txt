AFTER THE BLACKBIRD SINGS

I'm finding it hard,
Just to hang onto someone
Who's hangin' onto nothin'
Only to lose what's never mine.

And I'm finding it hard
Just to keep up with something
That's hangin' on to nothin'
To keep all these chains tied and in line, in line.

Pretty Angel,
She bites the hands of the lion,
Ties it up with ribbon,
Watches as hound dogs
Bang on her drums, drums.

It's so easy for you to love nobody,
It's so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore.

I seen this girl
She had her hands full of lightning,
Rolled it down to me,
Lolita smile,
With a thorn in her eyes.

Now she, she spun the world,
Up on the edge of a pearl,
A carnival's girl,
Up on a ferris wheel forever, forever.

So easy for you to love nobody,
So easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore,
Just don't try anymore.

Now she, she howled like an owl
Only to fall like a sparrow,
and lay beside the scarecrow.
But after the Blackbird sings
Is the song, the song.

It's just so,
It's just so easy for you to love nobody,
It's just so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore.
