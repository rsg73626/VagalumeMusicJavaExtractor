USED TO BE LUCKY

Now mine is a sunshine kind of a valentine
But sometimes I still don't feel even worth a dime
But it used to be different, before I'd been where I've been
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

Now you've got a heart so you know how it feels
When you can't move at the top of a ferris wheel
But I used to keep trying, but it always felt like dying
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

So sad
Everything's gone bad
In the dreams I've had
They all laugh at what I have

Oh, no
Tell me that it ain't true
When I awake I'm still me
Man, I wish I could once be you

Now I used to feel lucky, 'till I spent some time with me
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

Now if losing is amusing, man get a load of me
You see me fallin' in love with a guillotine
But it used to be funny, to think you would think of me
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

Now I wish I could just take all my things and leave
But I've fallen down in the wheels of this machine
But it used to be somethin', to be nowhere with nothin'
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

So sad
Everything's gone bad
In the dreams I've had
They all laugh at what I have

Oh, no
Tell me that it ain't true
When I awake I'm still me
Man, I wish I could once be you

Now I used to feel lucky, 'till I spent some time with me
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

Now if losing is amusing, man get a load of me
You see me fallin' in love with a guillotine
But it used to be funny, to think you would think of me
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

Now I wish I could just take all my things and leave
But I've fallen down in the wheels of this machine
But it used to be somethin', to be nowhere with nothin'
Oooh ooh ooh oooh

So sad
Everything's goin' bad
In the dreams I've had
They all laugh at what I have

Oh, no
Tell me that it ain't true
When I wake I'm still me
Man, I wish I could once be you
Now I used to feel lucky, 'till I spent some time with me

Oooh ooh ooh oooh
So sad
Everything's goin' bad
In the dreams I've had
They all laugh at what I have

Oh, no
Tell me that it ain't true
When I wake I'm still me
Man, I wish I could once be you

Now I used to feel lucky, 'till I spent some time with me
Oooh ooh ooh oooh
