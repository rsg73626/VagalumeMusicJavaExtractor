BE YOUR OWN GIRL

I know you're tired of wakin' up on the floor
Pushed to the edge with nothin' heavy to hold
Usin' your clothes as a blanket and a bed
Holdin' your hands just to lay your head.
I know you don't remember ever fallin' down
Who picked you up, who gathered around

But you don't have to be his girl,
and you don't have to be my girl,
you can always be your own girl.

With the sound of your feet you follow yourself to sleep
Restless and ageless and lookin' for something to keep
When you finally fall asleep you're awake in dreams
Hangin' by the ankles in the skeleton ravine.

I know you can't relax / your candle wax / you kicked the lights
fell on your shoes
Punched out the colors, leaving you the blues

But you don't have to be his girl,
you don't have to be my girl,
you can always be your own girl.

There's a soft melody that's ringin' in your ears
Simple and slow and always brings you here.
With broken crayons you've scribbled on the wall
Shapes of nothing and shadow boxed them all.

Your fingertips are broke, and your knees don't bend
Your imagination took the worst hit and cut its skin

But you don't have to be his girl,
and you don't have to be my girl,
you can always be your own girl.

There's a soft melody that's ringin' in my ears
It's the same one you could never avoid in yours
And if you lay down you can hear from tongue to tails
About a tattooed rhythm and drummin' by color wheel.

Your rung is broken on the bottom of the rope
And you can't tie another, another knot of hope

And you don't have to be his girl,
And you don't have to be my girl,
You can always be your own girl.
