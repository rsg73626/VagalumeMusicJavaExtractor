ALL THINGS NEW AGAIN

New heaven over a brand new sky
New breed of wonder on the vine
Among the living
There is new promise in this night

New arms to hold back the revolution
New eyes to recognize what you've become
New blood to recover
A new will to honor all God's creations

All things are new again
Within and without
All things are new again

New shepherd roaming through the tall grass
A new temple rising through the falling ash
That buries the tracks
Of millions of boots marching in packs

Clearwater rolling through the dam's collapse
Out to the harbor where they're sailing back
New flag on the mast
Without any secrets, without any past

All things are new again
Within and without
Sooner or later the ending begins
Just then it can be said that all things are new
again

New ghost returning to the earth beneath the haze
New poets burning through the lines of every page
I'm an unpainted portrait
I am staring at a new sunset
Without any memories yet

All things are new again
Within and without
Sooner or later the ending begins
Just then it can be said that all things are new
again
Within and without
Sooner or later every season ends
Then forever it can be said that all things are new again
