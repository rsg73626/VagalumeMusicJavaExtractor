HERE IN PLEASANTVILLE

If you could see yourself the way that I do 
You might change a thing or two 
You wouldn't look so angry 
You'd know it doesnt look good on you 
So grab your coat 
And grab your hat 
There ain't no stayin if we're comin back 

Cause something's gone 
So terribly wrong 
Here in pleasantville 

Do you remember how we'd stay out so late 
We use to have so much fun 
We use to wish that the mornin' sun just would never come 
Look at us now 
We're tucked in tight 
We're just praying for a little light 

Cause something's gone 
So terribly wrong 
Here in pleasantville 

I need to tell you now as we leave 
That it's much worse than you would believe 
And no matter how far you've been 
The beginning, that's where you are 
So I'm using my last match 
I'll put a fire up on every hill 
And burn down Pleasantville 

We never did learn to use our voices 
We never thought we'd be heard 
The only way they'd ever listen 
If we scream every word 
Beause there ain't nothing in our walk 
That just aint the kind of luck that we got 
So let's move on 

Cause something's gone 
So terribly wrong 
Here in pleasantville
