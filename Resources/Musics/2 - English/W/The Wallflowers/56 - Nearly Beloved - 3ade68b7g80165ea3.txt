NEARLY BELOVED

Last night I dreamt one thousand lies
I could see the dawn through a different set of eyes
There in my slumber passing time
Long live the world resting on its side

I walked the orchard with you
Your hand in mine
In the evergreens drinking wine
I saw the snow fall in black and white
From the auburn sky
Last night I lived more than one thousand lives
Not one of them survived

Up through the earth and at dawn I came
I crossed the kingdom through venom pouring rain
In the vacuum of my own brigade
Resurrected to make you mine again

Orpheus looked back once
She sailed the underworld
No second chances will be earned
I have returned as a phantom now
To walk the bow and stern
Last night I lived more than one thousand lives
Not one of them survived

If we could do better I know that we would
Maybe admit it now, we're not that good
We keep the needle between zero and one
You play your fiddle, baby, I'll play dumb

Into the pastures of our minds
Goes my nearly beloved and I
Blazing two parallel white lines
Through this broken heart spilt open wide

Time may be on my side
But it's mostly far behind
I was the apple of your eye
Now I'm the boy spinning on a wheel there
Stuck with knives
Last night I lived more than one thousand lives
Not one of them survived
