THE BEAUTIFUL SIDE OF SOMEWHERE

Tomorrow is gonna make you cry
It's gonna make you kneel
Before it breaks you from inside
Still pressing on
Arm over arm
Still trying to get both feet back on to the ground
They are harvesting these fields in autumn
We're different now than when we started

I am ready to wake up
There in the exodus
On the beautiful side of somewhere, baby

There on the pavement, underneath the yellow moon
I think of you and just how easily we bruise
A folded address in my pocket, I have stopped
Trying to believe for you that the bottom didn't drop
I am on the platform, covered with dust
I pray they take the both of us, and

I am ready to wake up
There in the exodus
On the beautiful side of somewhere, baby

And I am ready to come down
And see us both somehow
On the beautiful side of somewhere, someday

Somewhere, someday

I am lighting matches for the rescue
Some are candles, some are fuses
Acting on my best behavior
Switching over every breaker

As we're plowing through these laws of nature
Disregarding every acre
I'm lying in my Sunday best
Assuming this was not a test, and

I am ready to wake up
There in the exodus
On the beautiful side of somewhere, baby

And I am ready to come down
And see us both somehow
On the beautiful side of somewhere, someday

Somewhere, someday

Beautiful side of somewhere.
