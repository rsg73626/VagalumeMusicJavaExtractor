GOD DON'T MAKE LONELY GIRLS

Senorita
Looks like you ain't done nothin'
Good women ain't supposed to do
Oh no no no no

I seen her downtown
About an hour ago
Behind the glass at a peep show
I got nervous 'cause I don't know
Could she see me behind that window?

It's almost nine and I'm back in line
I can't get the girl with the Spanish tears
Out of my mind
I've got to make her mine, all mine

But somethin' is wrong
She don't belong
She oughta be back where she's from
Maybe back home is Mexico City
Man, I don't know
But she sure is pretty

God don't make lonely girls
Sure didn't want 'em in His world
(I know) God don't make lonely girls
Yeah, yeah, doo doo doo doo

Now when I make that girl all mine
I'm gonna stand by her
Once I get inside of
Her barbed wire
Once I get inside
I bet she'd look good in a brand new dress
She never felt good in her fish net
She's got to be this towns best mess
But it ain't nothin' that her face would suggest

God don't make lonely girls
Sure didn't want 'em in His world
(I know) God don't make lonely girls
Yeah, yeah, doo doo doo doo

I gotta make her see
I'm a guarantee
Oh, if she'd only come along with me
Well I can make her see
Gonna take a walk right through these walls
'Cause she's comin' home with me
I ain't even gonna touch her at all
Man, I'm only gonna lay awake and watch her sleep


God don't make lonely girls
Sure didn't want 'em in His world
(I know) God don't make lonely girls
Yeah, yeah, doo doo doo doo
