WE'RE ALREADY THERE

Quarter Moon,
On a city growing thick
With good advice that won't stick.
From the ballrooms to the suburbs,
abandoned mines
Atlantis may be rising but
We're all out of time.

The colored lights
On the fire escape,
And bodies move behind drapes,
And the light isn't even
And we're safer in pairs.
We're no match, for what is waiting
For each of us out there.

Whistle baby, while we walk.
Don't say anything, do not talk.
The journey is over, it is time to exhale.
Wherever we were going, we're already there.

So over the turnstyles,
Through the guard rails
And into Washington Square.
'Cause no amount of nightmares,
Will ever compare
To the thought of only silence
In this ghost-filled air.

Whistle baby, while we walk.
Don't say anything, do not talk.
The journey is over, it's too late to prepare.
Why can't you see that baby, we're already there.

Here comes your silhouette,
More pillow talk.
Here comes the ticking of these clocks.
They say the quickest way to end
A war is just to lose.
Another chamber locks
And I already withdrew.

Here comes the booming,
In the hunger of each night.
Here comes the burden of might.
Now this day was not divinely
Made to leave you impressed.
We may become someone someday
But we haven't yet.

Whistle baby, while we walk.
Don't say anything, do not talk.
The journey is over, it is time to repair.
Whatever we were building..... baby
We're Already There.

We're Already There.
We're Already There.
