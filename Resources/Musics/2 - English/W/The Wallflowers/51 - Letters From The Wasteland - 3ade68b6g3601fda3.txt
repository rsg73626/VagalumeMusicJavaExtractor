LETTERS FROM THE WASTELAND

Now coming down,
From out of this swan dive,
To your arms I make no sounds,
When I move through your reservoir,
But I wake up quick,
And I wake up sick,
As you,
Abandon me,
Into these fields,
Of rank and file,
Through this crowd I hear you breathing,
And through these bars I watch them bring more in,
Now I send back letters,
From the wasteland home,
Where I slow dance to this romance on my own,
It may take two to tango,
But boy,
Just one to let go,
It's just one to let go,
Now boy keep still,
Don't spread yourself around,
Get back in line,
Eat your bread and just work the plow,
'Cause you're not through,
They're not done with you,
Did you think you were,
The only one that's been let down,
So sleep tight,
Little boys of the new damned,
Another drop in the Tidal wave of quicksand,
Now I send back letters,
From the wasteland home,
Where I slowdance to this romance on my own,
It may take two to tango,
But boy,
Just one to let go,
Now another bad idea gets through,
Down the assembly,
Line to you,
You're every bridge I should have burned,
Every lesson I've unlearned,
But in this smokefilled waiting room,
With incarcerated love sick fools,
I wait for you to cut me loose,
But till then I...,
Send back letters from wasteland home,
Where I slowdance to this romance on my own,
Now I send back letters,
From the wasteland home,
From where I slowdance,
To this romance on my own.
