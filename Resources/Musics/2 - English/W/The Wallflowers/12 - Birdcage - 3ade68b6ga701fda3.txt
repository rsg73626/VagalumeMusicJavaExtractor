BIRDCAGE

So sad that you took it so badly
And acted so madly
So scared
like a baby by the morning
with sunlight unfolding
Your eyes have turned red
And are holding me
inside your story
In the end
you'll have started on a new one
Of anguish and delusions

He smiles
just like a magician
Who's just cast his illusions
of castles and sandstones
on the backbeach
And bright lights
within your reach
The sounds
of a warning
by the morning
of hound dogs coming for me
With the ropes leading back to your knees
And you looking straight at me

On your knees in the rain
with a basket of flowers
just for me
As the bells in the trees up above
all swung and rang softly
You said you rang them for me
For me
