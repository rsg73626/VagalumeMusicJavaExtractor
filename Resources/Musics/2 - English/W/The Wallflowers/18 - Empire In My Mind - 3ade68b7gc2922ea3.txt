EMPIRE IN MY MIND

There is trouble in my mind
There is dark
There is dark and there is light
Lay your hands above my eyes
As I look deep
The valleys deep and wide
Across the borderline
For the empire in my mind

You are the reason I don't sleep
You are the light
That's breaking through the East
And you know how hard I tried
To believe 
I have something good inside
All the barricades I've climbed
For the empire in my mind

I have known love somewhere in time
I've been lifted up
I look honor in the eyes
I have no reason I have no rhyme
I cannot deny
There's a darkness that's inside
I am guilty by design
And now I realise
That temptations made me blind
To the empire in my mind

There is no order
And there is chaos
And there is crime
There is no one to hold on tonite
in the empire of my mind

There is no distance that I don't see
I do have a world
No limit to my reach
I wish I would
I wish I might
To see a line tonight
Seperating wrong from right
As I'm only born to try
And maybe that's the reason why
I'm afraid someday I 'll find
There is no empire in my mind
