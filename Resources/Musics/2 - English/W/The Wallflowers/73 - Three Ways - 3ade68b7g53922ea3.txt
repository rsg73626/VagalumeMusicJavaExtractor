THREE WAYS

There's three ways out of every box
Fall out the bottom 
Or you crawl out the top
There's three ways 
Out of every, every box
But if you can't find your way out
The you just burn  it
To the ground
Then you'll disappear
Like smoke
Into the clouds

There's three ways off a merry-go-round
You either jump
Or you let it slow down
There's three ways
Off a a merry-go, merry-go-round
But if you can't put your foot down
Then you just burn it
To the ground
Then you walk away
Real slow
Back into the crowd

There's always somebody there for a laugh
Then you're the only one
That's left
Now that's what you get
Left behind in the wreck

There's three ways off a burning bridge
You pray for rain
Or you learn how to swim
There's three ways off of every burning bridge
But if you can't find the strength
And you quit
Then you can just burn up 
And sink
Then you'll drift away 
Real slow
Down into the ground
