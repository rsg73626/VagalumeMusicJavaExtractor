DAYS OF WONDER

Cherry picking through the stars
and falling cannonballs
waiting for the break of dawn
to start its morning crawl
polluted rays of filtered light
tropical and warm
making shadows through
the snow white resin covered skulls

happy birthday to the war

standing by the wall
a rainbow made of stars
under seven difference shades of grey
spreading out across the arc
days of wonder spent
out there killing time
now this may not leave a mark on me
but I sure as hell was there

caravanning on the moonlit
locust covered trail
we came out like a stream of bats
exploding from the well
slipping through the whirlpools
of trees and floating cars
behind winter coated mule
down record breaking falls

into olblivions open jaws

standing by the wall
a rainbow made of stars
under seven difference shades of grey
spreading out across the arc
days of wonder spent
out there killing time
now this may not leave a mark on me
but I sure as hell was there

happy birthday to the war

days of wonder spent
by a rainbow made of stars
under seven different shades of grey
spreading out across the arc
standing by the wall
out there killing time
now this may not leave a mark on me
but I sure as hell was there

educated under God
to walk a neutral line
give me neither poverty
nor riches in my time
take my body and my mind
my heart is far behind
with one dozen poems in my ears
