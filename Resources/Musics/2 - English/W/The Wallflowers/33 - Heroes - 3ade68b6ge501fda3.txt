HEROES

I-I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins-like dolphins can swim
Though nothing-nothing will keep us together
We can beat them-forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes-just for one day

I-I will be king
And you-you will be queen
Though nothing-nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes-just for one day
We can beat them-just for one day

I-I remember
Standing-by the wall
And the guns-shot above our heads
And we kissed-as though nothing could fall
And the shame-was on the other side
Oh we can beat them-forever and ever
Then we could be heroes-just for one day

We can be heroes (3X)
Just for one day
