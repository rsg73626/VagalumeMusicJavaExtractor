I AM A BUILDING

I'm here by my window
I am waiting for your parade
I will salute you
From above the crowd
As you make your way
You won the battle
You've won the war
I admit it now
I could not give any more
My condition is your reward
I am a building
Here without doors

The altitude is now
Getting to me
As they applaud you
On the boulevard
The whole valley looks like
Someone's body
And all the people look like
Little scars
This day is taking
Forever
I will never say
Never say never again
The flesh around me
is only pretend
Return to sender
Every letter
That is yours
I am sure
That I am a building
Here without doors

Fire blazing
On the overpass
Cattle grazing
In fields of dead grass
Last summer was earthquake weather
By November
This too should have passed
I am not moving
I am landlocked
I am looking through
A thousand windows spread across
A thousand floors
There in a landfill
Where Eden was before
But not anymore
I am a building
Here without doors

Did you see me waving to you from above
Things are looking clear now
My eyes are wide enough to see the way a sniper does
Behind the barrel of a good gun

For worse or better
I surrender
It may not matter
But I'm sadder than you'll ever know
I am your inferno
Here all in yellow
With embers blowing north
No sense in returning
I'm not worried anymore
I am a building
That is here without doors

I am a building
That is here without doors
