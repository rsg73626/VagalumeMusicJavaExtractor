WITNESS

         I'm standing outside your window baby
         And there you are
         Another year,another candle's burning
         For the party girl
         No one even knows you're there
         Happy Birthday
         No one cares
         You come around here
         You'd better bring a witness 
         Everyone in here's on the guest list
         And when you're gone you won't be missed
         Keep one eye open
         When you kiss
         Your wishes won't be coming true this year
         Darlin' don't you cry
         We're gonna teach you everything 
         You'll learn to get by
         Now lesson number one in homicide
         Is emotial murder's no crime
         You come around here
         You'd better bring a witness
         Everyone in here's on the guest list
         When you're gone you won't be missed
         Keep one eye open
         When you kiss
         Sticks and stones baby break your bones
         But the names in here can kill
         We'd let you leave
         But no one else wants you
         Your ransom was not made
         Now you don't have to stand up tall
         But now baby you must stand up
         You come around here
         You'd better bring a witness
         Everyone in here's on the guest list
         Now we've never been so impressed
         Keep one eye open
         When whenever you kiss
