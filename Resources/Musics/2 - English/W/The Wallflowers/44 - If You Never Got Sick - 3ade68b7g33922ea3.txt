IF YOU NEVER GOT SICK

well that ain't a parachute
that ain't a ripcord
that ain't a body of water
we're headed for
there's so little time left
so much to be done
even you are gonna need someone

that ain't a trick of light
or the morning haze
come on in from the lake
get it into your eyes
this invisible breath
of a storm on the rise
that i feel whenever you arrive

and i may not be quick
i maybe never was
but tell me whatever it is that you've become
baby if you never got sick 
i wouldn't get to hold you
baby if you never got sick
i wouldn't get to hold you

this ain't a righteous love
even a good one
these ain't the kinds of returns
that i was thinking of
i'm unbearable now, you ain't seen nothin yet
you'll see me dead before you see me quit

that ain't a jug of wine that you been drinkin from
now lay back, now baby and let your fever come
i'll bury you in just to dig you out
i don't have any use for being proud
and the deeper the slide
the higher the rise
now don't be disappointed how i'm usin mine

baby if you never got sick
i wouldn't get to hold you
baby if you never got sick
i wouldn't get to hold you

i think i made a mistake
i think i pushed when you said wait
but i never get to hold you

i followed you deep into a berry field
there was someone you were running from
when i needed to sleep that's when you disappeared
but i did get the impossible done
and i always knew that there was god inside of you
i just never did learn which one

baby if you never got sick
i wouldn't get to hold you
baby if you never got sick
i wouldn't get to hold you
baby if you never got sick
i would never get to hold you
