WHEN YOU'RE ON TOP

I need a bed
That nobody's slept in
I need some air
Nobody's been breathing
I need a thought
That I can believe in
Is this fog
Or is the building really burning
I need you now
Much more than ever
I'm making new friends
But none of them matter
Maybe now
We don't fit together
But you've got your arms around
No one but strangers

(chorus)
I feel fine
With the sun in my eyes
The wind in my hair
When I'm falling out of this sky
I'm doing better than I thought I would
But nothing's ever as good
As when you're on top

I want to wake up
And just start running
Into a ditch
Or straight up a mountain
I want to get
Where no one's been getting
Make it deeper than hell
Or make it higher than heaven
I need someone
Whose price hasn't been met
When everybody's disappearing
By the minute
There isn't anyone left
I haven't met yet
And I remember
When they hadn't gotten to you yet

(chorus)

(bridge)
Half way up
And over this rainbow
I heard a shot
Fire up from the ghetto
As I drop
I didn't think you'd follow
Just didn't know
The sky was this shallow

I need a garden
Where nothing's forbidden
I need an apple
No one's been eatin'
I want to start again
Back at the beginnin'
I had a vision
That this feeling maybe has an ending.
