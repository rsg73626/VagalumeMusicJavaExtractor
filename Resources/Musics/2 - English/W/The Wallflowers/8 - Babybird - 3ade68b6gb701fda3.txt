BABYBIRD

Come back babybird
With your dirty wings in tatters
Come home where you belong
Nobody knows you better
Now bring back your velvet heart
And we'll make you brand new feathers
Sleep through the morning light
With your arms around your brother

Babybird
come back home
Babybird
you were never really on your own

Now outside faces cry
With the tears of lonesome orphans
And behind every mask
is the face of another
Wherever you have been
wherever you took cover
No arms that pulled you in
could hold you like your mother

Babybird
come back home
Babybird
you were never really on your own

When all my colors fade
And my wings, they've turned to leather
I'll know the reasons why
God let me get older
When all my days are through
And I fly these hills no longer
I'll lay beneath the stars
And I'll watch you flying over

Babybird
come back home
Babybird
you were never really on your own

Babybird
come back home
Babybird
you will never be all alone
