LOVE IS A COUNTRY

No, there won't be an ambush anytime soon
If the birds are returning, 
it's safe enough to say that much is true
In the desert that borders between me and you
Where more than a few good men 
have failed to come back or get through
And the only things living around here don't wanna talk
And the wine isn't working and the vacancy signs are off
The hardships of marching they've only just begun
Love is a country better crossed when you're young

I'm staring in the window of a moving train
That looks almost human 
as she barrels down the tracks and comes my way
This no good dog of mine's got the heart of a stray
And is down in the ditch lights 
before I've even a chance to call his name
I'm watching the clouds overwhelming the evening sun
It's just after lightning and before the thunder comes
When nothing really happens and suddenly then it does
Love is a country better served with someone

I remember the evening you last came home
It was warm as the devil sat back up with his boots put back on
He said you never get boring, you keep me young
There's more work than ever 
and still only one of me to get it done
Now her ring's on the seat riding shotgun next to my hat
With her name on the window 
where fog settles down on the glass
Nowhere in the middle of somewhere that has no past
Love is a country you leave and not welcome back
You leave and not welcome back

Love is a country that won't be overcome
That won't be overcome
