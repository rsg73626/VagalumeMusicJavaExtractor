HOW GOOD IT CAN GET

Slow down, you're breaking up
Use your words don't yell so much
I don't understand a word that you're saying

Move in, and come up close
You look like you've maybe seen a ghost
Tell me has someone gotten to you baby

Open your arms
Pick up your head
Open your Eyes
So you can see what happens next


[Chorus]

You won't believe just how good it can get
We'll make a lover out of you yet

[End Chorus]

The fog is so thick I can't see my hands
It got much worse soon as I got in
I know you're somewhere here in the water

It's 10 feet deep and the river wont' stop
I'll tell you what's in it when I make it accross
You can make it too, if you listen we'll help you

Yeah But you've got give in
When you've got to let go
Then you can begin
To come up slow like a dessert rose

[Chorus Twice]

Take a deep breath and hold it in tight
Push your face up right into the light
Can't you feel that full moon shining down on you

Help is coming from the great unknown
Just maybe not when you needed it most
Cause I an see that you already know that you're leaving

But I wish you'd stay
And just let me in 
Cause everything can change
But you've got to be ready casue you won't know when

[Chorus 3 times]
