LAUGHING OUT LOUD

Man, you oughta finish what you started
You can't leave me here alive
Well I know it started as a fist fight
But you've got me covered up in hives.

I don't need an invitation
The best peach is at the top of that tree
(But) when all this indecision reigns
It's your aimlessness that helps me see straight.

You got me walkin' up a tightrope
With vaseline from my head to my feet
You got me lookin' into blindfolds
But I know you've got your hands all over me

So when all these imitations fail
Just don't look back 'cause I won't be there.

Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just what it was all about.
Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just why you'd push me around.

I'm doing time inside a grapevine
Little things amuse little minds
Well, nothin's free except a little bit of bad advice
On how to live on only water, bread and rice.

I don't need an invitation
The best peach is at the top of that tree
So when all this nighttime vision fails
I'll lose all these chains and slip out of this jail.

Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just what it was all about.
Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just why you'd push me around.
Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just what it was all about.
Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just why you'd push me around.
