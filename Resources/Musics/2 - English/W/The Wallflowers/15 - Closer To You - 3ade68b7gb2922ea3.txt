CLOSER TO YOU

How soft a whisper can get
When your're walking through a 
Crowded space
I hear every word being said
And I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you

How long an hour can take
When you're staring into open
space
When I feel I'm slipping further 
away
I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you

These are the days
That I won't get back
I won't hear you cry
Or hear you laugh
And when it's quiet 
And i don't hear a thing
I can always hear you breathe

You know there's nowhere else
I've wanted to be
Than be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too
But don't give up on me
And just remember that when you
Were asleep
I got a little bit closer to you
