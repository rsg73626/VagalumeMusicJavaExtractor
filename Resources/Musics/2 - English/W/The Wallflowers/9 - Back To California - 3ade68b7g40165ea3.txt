BACK TO CALIFORNIA

Feels like a ghost here in this room
Not the kind that rides a saddle in a costume
All around me, all around you
In from the window for a drag of your perfume

Let's move back to California
Let's make a promise, baby
Let's both be there
Put our feet deep in sand
This garden's only got four corners
Back to your trenches, back to California

The days keep coming and the years overlap
Been crawling all over each other like wet cats
I hear the rebels yelling out in the dunes
And I don't think it's half as funny as I used to

Let's move back to California
Let's make a promise, baby
Let's both be there
Put our feet deep in the sand
Let's leave behind these maps and handguns
We're on our way back to California

We've got California in our eyes
Come on and catch us if you can
With California in our eyes

Passing down through a valley full of lost sheep
Straight is the gate, narrow is the walkway
Mercury rising and poppies in bloom
This is the kind of thing that I can get used to

Let's move back to California
Let's make a promise, baby
Let's both be there
Put our feet deep in the sand
There's still no shortage in creating bad blood
We're on our way back to California

We've got California in our eyes
Come on and catch us if you can
With California in our eyes
Fast as we can
Back to California
Come on and catch us if you can
Back to California
Fast as we can
Back to California
