HERE HE COMES (CONFESSIONS OF A DRUNKEN MARIONETTE)

Here comes your drunken marionette
Dragging his mess of threads
There at the bar pulling smoke to his lungs
He says who will ignore me when you're gone?

Now come on lift me up
I wanna dance by your tin cup
Tower of beauty with a split in your tongue
Who will ignore me when you're gone?
He says who will ignore me when you're gone?

Here he cooooooomes
Here he cooooooomes
Be still the wooden heart
That wouldn't ever part
With the drunken marionette

Been mainlining bad thoughts
Been drinking things I wish I'd not
Intoxicated with sad songs
Who will forgive you when I'm gone?

They sing auld lang syne
I've got mutiny on my mind
A guilty conscience means at least you've got one
Who will forgive you when I'm gone?
He says who will forgive you when I'm gone?

Here he comes
Here he comes
Be still the wooden heart
Who wouldn't ever part
Waiting on a spark
That hasn't happened yet
For the drunken marionette

Carry on
Turn the lights on when you go
In the hours left
I hope you feel the things that i know I won't

What you give is what you get
I get so worried bout your debts
Who carries evil out evil will come
Who will defend you when I'm gone?
He says who will defend you when I'm gone?

Here he comes
Here he comes
Be still the wooden heart
Wouldn't ever part
Waiting on a spark
That hasn't happened yet

Here he comes
Here he comes
Be still the wooden heart
That wouldn't ever part
Waiting on a spark
That hasn't happened yet
