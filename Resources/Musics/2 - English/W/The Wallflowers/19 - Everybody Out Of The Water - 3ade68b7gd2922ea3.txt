EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER

Now on your mark
Get set, let's go
You got to move now before she explodes
Look out the window and out below
Back away from the glass
There she blows

The city's been levelled
The hills are in flame
The streets cracked up
And when we're pushing up clay
The temperatures dropped
The sky is gray
And it ain't even over
Comes driving rain

It ain't me that you feel
There's something moving around in here
That's blood, That's tears
This ain't a warning

Everybody out of the water
And up on dry land
Take what you can
Cause you won't be here again
Eveybody out of the water

Now I'm treading high water to get back to you
Looking for a little spot or something to cling to
There's too many bodies there's not enough room
God help me and God help you
They say nobody panic, help is on its way
We're already on it, you got to be brave
If you can fix it now then don't make us wait
Man they ain't nobody coming back away from the gates

That bell you hear, That's hell ringing in your ears
I fear, that my dear, this ain't a warning

Everybody out of the water
And up on dry land
Take what you can
Cause you won't be here again
I loved you then
Like I love you now
That don't matter anyhow
This is the new frontier
Everybody out of the water

Now I 'm looking up and the shit keeps coming
Like shooting ducks in a barrel of honey
You've got to learn how to pray
love won't be enough
Admit it now, your information sucks

As I slip, down in, I think of a someplace high up a mountain
Smoke clears the fog lifts
Little by little we rebuild again
till then,

Everybody out of the water
And up on dry land
Take what you can
Cause you won't be here again
I loved you then
Like I love you now
It won't matter anyhow
This is the new frontier
Everybody out of the water

Everybody out of the water
Everybody out of the water
