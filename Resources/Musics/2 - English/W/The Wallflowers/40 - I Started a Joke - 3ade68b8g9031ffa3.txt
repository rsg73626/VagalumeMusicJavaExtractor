I STARTED A JOKE

I started a joke. Which started the whole world crying.
But I didn't see that the joke was on me.
Oh, no, I started to cry. Which started the whole worldlaughing.
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.

I looked at the skies. Running my hands over my eyes.
And I fell out of bed. Hurting my heads from things that Isaid.

Till I finally died. Which started the whole world living.
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.
