MOURNING TRAIN

Mama don't 'you send me no love this month
'cause my heart is all used up
and mama I wanna come home
I wanna get back home

So look out into the morning rain
'cause I'm on the mourning train

I'm bringing down my suitcase now
I'm shining up my good shoes brown
'cause no-one knows my name
now, no-one knows my name
So look out into the morning rain
'cause I'm on the mourning train

Mama look at me now
Oh how I wish
You were around
So many friends I wish
I had right now

Mister you can't hurt me now
You've got my girl, I still don't know how
But it don't matter now
No it don't matter now
So look out into the morning rain
'cause I'm on,
I'm already on
The mourning train
