BLEEDERS

Once upon a time, they called me the bleeder,
Swimmin' up this river, with sentimental fever,
But this ain't my first ride, it ain't my last try,
Got to keep movin' on,
If they catch me ever, they'll throw me back forever.

I guess I should be ashamed,
But I forget to be vain,
I did the best I could, I guess,
But everything just bleeds.
They say you're only sad and lonely,
and no one is impressed.

I sent it off in a letter, I need somethin' better,
Than a nail and a hammer to put me back together.
But this ain't my first ride, it ain't my last try,
Just got to keep a movin' on,
Got to keep this together, maybe next time is never.

I guess I should be ashamed,
But I forget to be vain,
I did the best I could, I guess,
But everything just bleeds.
They say you're only sad and lonely,
and no one is impressed.

Sometimes I must confess,
I do feel a little overdressed,
Sometimes it's hard to tell the wishing from the well,
Where you threw the penny and where it fell.

I guess I should be ashamed,
But I forget to be vain,
I did the best I could, I guess,
But everything just bleeds.

I guess I should be ashamed,
But I forget to be vain,
I did the best I could, I guess,
But everything just bleeds.
They say you're only sad and lonely,
And no one is impressed.
