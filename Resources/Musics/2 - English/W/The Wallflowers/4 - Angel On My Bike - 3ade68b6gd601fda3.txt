ANGEL ON MY BIKE

She knows just what I like
The angel on my bike
She found me down on a two-ton anchor
Tangled up in a wire

She always gets it right
The angel on my bike
I could be killed if the train goes faster
Well, angel, watch my life.

I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's at prayer
It's 45 miles on that highway
Angel, double a prayer

Half asleep with my eyes on the white lines
Elvis in need of repair
I only wanted to believe
That angel it's me that you need
And there's only, only one heart on that highway
Angel, double a prayer

I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's at prayer
I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's at prayer

Now it's hard time on these wheels
These fairytales
Turn to rusted steel
And it's gettin' hard now to believe
She's seein' me

Angel, please, tell me can't you see
Angel it's only me
Angel it's only me

Well I can't take a care
Oh man I want but I can't be there
While angel's at prayer
I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's at prayer
