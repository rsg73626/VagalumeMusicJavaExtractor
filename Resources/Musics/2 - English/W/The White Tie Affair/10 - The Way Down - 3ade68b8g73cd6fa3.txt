THE WAY DOWN

You know that actions speak louder than words
I thought we were past that, forget what you heard
Pay no attention, better to shut out the lights
Than to find yourself at home all alone thinking

Problems won't disappear
When I look you in the eye something isn't right
Problems will interfere
And I don't think we'll survive
I've built it up so high

My teardrop waiting for the fall out
(This must be the way down)
And in one stop everything's a burn out
(This must be the way down)
Everything was bound to change
Never going to the same town
(This must be the way down)

Everything was perfect 'til the train went right off
the rail
Like we were passed out asleep at the wheel
When you know you've lost it, there's no one in
control
And you will find yourself too high, better try just
letting it go

Problems won't disappear
When I look you in the eye something isn't right
Problems will interfere
And I don't think we'll survive
I've built it up so high

My teardrop waiting for the fall out
(This must be the way down)
And in one stop everything's a burn out
(This must be the way down)
Everything was bound to change
Never going to the same town
(This must be the way down)

And now that the smoke is gone
I can see that I'm all alone
Forever
I need you to come back home
And now that the smoke is gone
I can see that I'm all alone
Forever

My teardrop waiting for the fall out
(This must be the way down)
And in one stop everything's a burn out
(This must be the way down)
Everything was bound to change
Never going to the same town
(This must be the way down)
