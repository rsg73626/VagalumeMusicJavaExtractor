YOU LOOK BETTER WHEN I'M DRUNK

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better
You look better when I'm drunk
you look better,

It's the right night to make the wrong moves gotta
bad case and nothing to lose when the
lights out we have an excuse, is this romance
Or is it the juice?

I might be crazy but I think tonight has only begun
(gun gun)
Your not my normal type but we can make an exception
(on on)

A little less thinkin' and a lot more drinkin
That'll work for me tonight (oh, oh)
When the room starts spinnin' and we start sinnin',
I begin to realize

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better ... drunk,
You look better ... drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk

It' a-bout time I learn my lesson but this
lesson is under my skin it's a
new night a new location so I
wait for the buzz to kick in

I might be crazy but I think tonight is already done
(done done)
I'm not your normal type but we can make an exception
(on on)

A little less thinkin' and a lot more drinkin
That'll work for me tonight (oh, oh)
When the room starts spinnin' and we start sinnin',
I begin to realize

You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better ....drunk,
You look better ... drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk

Hey DJ spin the soundtrack to bad decisions
And these drinks, make me, lose my self control,
Hey DJ spin the soundtrack to bad decisions
And these drinks, make me lose control

(thats why)

You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk,
You look better ....drunk,
You look better ... drunk,
You look better when I'm drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk
