DO I EVEN NEED TO SAY IT

I'm stairing at a picture,
a plastic silhouette, i'm alive.
oh, i wish that i could walk away from this not so perfect lie, i'm alive.
oh,oh whos the one to stay caught this spade to speed i'm sure said a ride by the look on you're face.

-Chorus-
do you ever listen to your words (you were never one to blame)
do you ever listen to your words (you were never one to)

i know, you know, that is going to be, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh.
were going to cut his clothes for somewhere else to go.
this show is over.

And as the story is told 5 years ago, your not the same person i used to...find myself away more and more each day. simply sending sorrys to myself, im not the same.

-Chorus-
do you ever listen to your words (you were never one to blame)
do you ever listen to your words (i should of been the one to blame)

i know, you know, that is going to be, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh.
were going to cut his clothes for somewhere else to go.
this show is over.

And don't tell me your okay with this lie...lie. see for another time. i'll take the blame if you would just say goodbye.

do you ever listen to your words. your not, not coming around.
and do, do you ever, do ever wish you were somebody
and do, do you ever, do ever wish you were somebody else
(and do you wish you were somebody and do you wish you were somebody else)
(and do you wish you were some where and do you wish you were some where else)

i know, you know, that is going to be
i know, you know, that is going to be, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh.
were going to cut his clothes for somewhere else to go.
this show is over.
[x2]

I'm not down, everyone head for the doors. and no need, need for an encore
lights out, everyone head for the doors. and no need, the show is over
