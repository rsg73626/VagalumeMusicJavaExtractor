THE ENEMY

I come in late with no surprise
you're always standing at the door with those angry eyes
you stayed up late just to start this fight
but my ears are getting tired I think ill call this a night

You keep on talking but I’m not listening
I'll be the first to say I’m sorry just to be this to end
You keep on talking but I’m not listening
I'll be the first to say I’m sorry just to be this to end

I know that its strange that straight to this very day
I'll be the only one to say that I'm sorry without you
you know that its real don’t make it a big deal
I'll be the only one to say that I'm sorry without you

You're always chiming in with your this and that
your crying at my door like a pussy cat
I thought that it was over and that was that
but you insist to persist me
irrational enemy

You keep on talking but I’m not listening
I'll be the first to say I’m sorry just to be this to end
You keep on talking but I’m not listening
I'll be the first to say I’m sorry just to be this to end

I know that its strange that straight to this very day
I'll be the only one to say that I'm sorry without you
you know that its real don’t make it a big deal
I'll be the only one to say that I'm sorry without you

appreciate validate sleeping with the enemy
honest honest honest this is the way we play (X2)
