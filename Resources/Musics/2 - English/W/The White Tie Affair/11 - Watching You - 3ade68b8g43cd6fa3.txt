WATCHING YOU

She likes it better when you come in early,
She doesn't like it when you stay out late,
You hear the noise outside your window,
She's dangerous make no mistake,

So lock your doors
And take a breath,
Don't fall asleep prepar yourself,
She's not all there (not all there),
She's not all there,
She's right there.

Help me help me somebody save me,
I keep running she keeps on chasing,
Reminds me all the time; no matter where you go I'll always be watching you,
Help me help me somebody save me,
I keep running she keeps on chasing,
Reminds me all the time; not matter where you go I'll always be watching you.

This is the first time I let it show,
I should have never got personal,
The mood was set and the lights were on,
What do you think could ever...
I didn't know that she was normal when I caught her eye,
Because she's Mrs. Dr Jekyl and Mrs. Hyde,
And now her heart beats for me,
Blood runs colder,
Heart beats for me,
Blood runs colder.

Help me help me somebody save me,
I keep running she keeps on chasing,
Reminds me all the time; no matter where you go I'll always be watching you,
Help me help me somebody save me,
I keep running she keeps on chasing,
Reminds me all the time; not matter where you go I'll always be watching you.

Watching you.....

Help me help me somebody save me,
I keep running she keeps on chasing,
Reminds me all the time; no matter where you go I'll always be watching you,
Help me help me somebody save me,
I keep running she keeps on chasing,
Reminds me all the time; not matter where you go I'll always be watching you.

(always be watching you)
Help me help me
(always be watching you)
No matter where you go I'll always be watching you
