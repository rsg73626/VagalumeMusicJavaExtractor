SCENE CHANGE

Walk softly, don't want to disturb the dead
is it an enemy in front of me, or have I been mislead
should I stay of fold, I think I'll pack my shit and go
I've always been the wait around type, underground,
nothing more than a friend

Wear these clothes, walk this way, do exactly what they say
It's your life, but they're way, follow me it's all the same
Wear these clothes, walk this way, do exactly what they say
It's your life, but they're way, follow me it's all the same

So count your chips and roll the dice you might find
it's twice as nice, around and around again, get in where you fit in
I know it's quite deceiving when I look but I don't see me,
around and around again, get in where you fit in

I think that I might try it find another way to buy it
I should just get out of my way, no.
I guess it ain't so bad, it was the best time that I never had
It's my move, my say, I think I like it this way

Wear these clothes, walk this way, do exactly what they say
It's your life, but they're way, follow me it's all the same
Wear these clothes, walk this way, do exactly what they say
It's your life, but they're way, follow me it's all the same

So count your chips and roll the dice you might find
it's twice as nice, around and around again, get in where you fit in
I know it's quite deceiving when I look but I don't see me,
around and around again, get in where you fit in
How does it feel to be alone

Wear these clothes walk this way do exactly what they say
It's your life, but there way, follow me. It's all the same.
Wear these clothes walk this way do exactly what they say

Cross my heart and hope to die, I'll make it through this common lie...
your move, their way, can you get in where you...
