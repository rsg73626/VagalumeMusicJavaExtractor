THE LETDOWN

So I was thinking about
what i'd write to you
It's been three
Days since I heard your voice
and I aint been right without you

A one night stand and a photograph
made its way to you
I took a chance
paid the consequence

this is why I'm writing to you.
Was it a big surprise
Is it too late to try
Go ahead and cry
It was just one little lie

I hope that you don't mind
I'll make it up this time
Is it too late to try
it was just one lie

Baby I think I owe you one
every time I come around your ready for the letdown.
Here I sit alone it was my fault I know.
If I were you I wouldn't take me back
Just let me down

Its not hard for me to say the things that you do
You bring out the best in me
When its not the best for you
It's been a long time since I didn't know
What to do
Where to go
could we forget yesterday
Start over again

Was it a big surprise
Is it too late to try
Go ahead and cry
It was just one lie

Baby I think I owe you one
every time I come around your ready for the letdown.
Here I sit alone it was my fault I know.
If I were you I wouldn't take me back
Just let me down. (X2)

You need to believe it when I say that I am so so so sorry for the things I put you through
Never meant to take the trust from you (X4)

Baby I think I owe you one
every time I come around your ready for the letdown.
Here I sit alone it was my fault I know.
If I were you I wouldn't take me back
Just let me down. (X3)
