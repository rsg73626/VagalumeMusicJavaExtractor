WALKIN' THE ROAD

We were walkin down that road one time,
Her hand in mine,
It felt so fine,
But deep inside
Was lurking, something grey?.
This feeling that we shared was blue,
But I could tell that their was something new
And I was thinking this could be my final day


So, if what you said
To me was true
That you need me
And I need you
Then why now must we
Go on separated ways.

It just wasn't what it used to be,
What once was there had been set free,
In her head she moved on to someone else,
So no longer mine,
And left behind,
I threw myself out on the line
But now im done and babe this is the end


So, if what you said
To me was true
That you need me
And I need you
Then why now must we
Go on separated ways.

Well, I tried to leave the baggage left behind,
Tried to live without a trace of a worried mind.

So, if what you said
To me was true
That you need me
And I need you
Then why now must we
Go on separated ways.   3x
