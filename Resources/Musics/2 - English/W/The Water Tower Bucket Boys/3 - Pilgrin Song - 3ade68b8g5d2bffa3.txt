PILGRIN SONG

I am a pilgrim and I am not wanted here
I walk the same roads you do, you do not find me there
I haul a heavy burden, I haul it everywhere
I am a pilgrim and I seek what is not there
I seek what is not there

I walk the roads for miles, my burden's hard to bear
The sun beats on my shoulders, I just don't seem to care
I keep myself a journal, no words are written there
I am a pilgrim and I seek what is not there
I seek what is not there

I found the water and I lay my burdens down
I left the shore behind me, my soul is heaven bound
My wandering days are over since I climbed those golden stairs
I am a pilgrim and I seek what is not there

I seek what is not there
I seek what is not there
I seek what is not there
