MEET ME WHERE THE CROW DON'T FLY

Meet me where the crow don't fly
Meet me you might have to lie
Go on, take me by the hand so we can reach into the gland
To make us fly

Meet me by the dried up lake
And please make sure you leave no wake
Step onto the boat so 
I can reach into your throat and make it dry

And everyone that chose it
You can tell they knows it
Cuz everyone is all the same

Now meet me where the crow don't fly
Meet me you might have to lie
Go on, take me by the hand so we can reach into the gland
To make us fly

Meet me by the dried up lake
And please make sure you leave no wake
Go on, step onto the boat so 
I can reach into your throat and make it dry

And everyone that chose it
You can tell they knows it
Cuz everyone is all the same

And everyone that chose it
You can tell they know
Cuz everyone is all the same
The sa-a-a-a-a-me

The same
The same
The same
The same
