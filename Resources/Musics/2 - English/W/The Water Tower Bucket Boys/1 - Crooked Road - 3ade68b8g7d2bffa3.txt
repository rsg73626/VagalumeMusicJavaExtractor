CROOKED ROAD

Pullin out of tallahassee,
The blue ridge was on our minds,
We heard tales in our childhood
Of those who lived on tunes and shine
Well we finally got our chance
While rolling down the ol' crooked road
He said boys come here close,
There is something you must know

Mountain dew, corn liquor, and white whiskey,
This homebrew is the secret of these hills,
And if you stumble upon a shiner by the creekside,
You may find yourself six feet below his still

Now this here is the finest moonshine,
One swaller and your head will turn to gold
So we sipped and took our chances
And drank up as we'd been told,
If its bad you may go blind,
If its good you may be in for it all,
It makes the quietest man rowdy,
The smallest woman 10 feet tall

Mountain dew, corn liquor, and white whiskey,
This homebrew is the secret of these hills,
And if you stumble upon a shiner by the creekside,
You may find yourself six feet below his still

As we rolled down the blueridge,
The lighting was in my hands,
And I knew at that moment
I held the secret to this great land,
So pass the shine play a tune grab your partner
And swing them round
Well all you pretty women,
Oh you know I'm bound

2x
Mountain dew, corn liquor, and white whiskey,
This homebrew is the secret of these hills,
And if you stumble upon a shiner by the creekside,
You may find yourself six feet below his still
