GIVE ME LOVE GIRL

I know, was the first time I saw you, but you blowed my mind
Your lips was so incredible, your eyes was shining bright like the stars
And I just can't take you from my head
Give me love girl, give me love girl
The way you walk and talk, always teasing me
What's your name? Where are you from? Give me love girl, give me love girl
My sweet, my baby, my angel, girl I'm so addict to you
And how can it make sense if all I see is the distance between us?
So get closer and don't be affraid
I can show you a world that you've never seen
Just belive in me
Give me love girl, give me love girl
Give me love girl, give me love girl
Cause you know what I want from you

I know what you like
You know I want to
I know what you like
You know I want to from you
