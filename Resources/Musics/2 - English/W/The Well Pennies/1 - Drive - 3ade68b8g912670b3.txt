DRIVE

There you go, tapping at my window
There you go rattling my heart
Far away I wanna go with you
Everyday and never be apart

When you're feeling empty
When the skies are grey
I will be your honey
And chase the blues away

Let's go out for a drive
Need a little sunshine
Need a little sunshine
What a day for feeling alive
Want a little more time
Just a little more time
With you

Here we are, sitting by the sidewalk
Here we are, whistling a song
Close your eyes, I'll dream away with you
Lullabies, humming right along
When you're feeling lonely
When the stars are dim
I will love you only, love you to the end

Let's go out for a drive
Need a little sunshine
Need a little sunshine
What a day for feeling alive
Want a little more time
Just a little more time

And the world keeps spinning by
Keeps you and I holding on
In the dark you're all I see
It's you and me
Right where we belong

Let's go out for a drive
Need a little sunshine
Need a little sunshine
What a day for feeling alive
Want a little more time
Just a little more time

Let's go out for a drive
Need a little sunshine
Need a little sunshine
What a day for feeling alive
Want a little more time
Just a little more time
With you
