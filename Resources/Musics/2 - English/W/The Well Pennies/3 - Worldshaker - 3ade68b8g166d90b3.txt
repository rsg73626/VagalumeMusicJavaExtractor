WORLDSHAKER

It seems these days
Blue is covered up in a cloud and a blanket of grays
I know it's fine
But I feel a lot better with you and a bottle of wine

Every color's fading
Every one is waiting on, on

But there's a song arising
Just you wait and see
Won't you take my hand and
Shake the world with me
Shake the world with me

This heart in me
It feels like a feather but hurts like the sting of a bee
I know it's fine
Cause I can bring the rattle and you can bring that shine

Every color's fading
Every one is waiting on, on

But there's a song arising
Just you wait and see
Won't you take my hand and
Shake the world with me
Shake the world with me
