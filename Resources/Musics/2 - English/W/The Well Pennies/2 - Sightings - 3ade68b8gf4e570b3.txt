SIGHTINGS

There's that sound
A moan or a sigh
Sure, I know
A hope from a lie

So you've been
Away for a spell
There's that ghost
A story to tell
Oh, a flicker in the rain

Oh, a tremor in your vein
Different kinds of these broken lines
Leave me staring out in the cold
I could see you there
Almost anywhere
Like a glimmer or so I'm told

Can you feel
A storm in the air
Let it out
A cry or a prayer

Oh, a flicker in the rain
Oh, a tremor in your vein
Different kinds of these broken lines
Leave me staring out in the cold
I could see you there
Almost anywhere
Like a glimmer or so I'm told

There's that sound
A moan or a sigh
Sure, I know
A hope from a lie
