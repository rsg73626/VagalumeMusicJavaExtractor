FALLING IN WAVES

I'll talk to you all day
Just because makes me well
I've always been invisible
Until you found me

And when I'm falling down
I hope there is a wave there
To take me to you

And now I'm falling down
I hope there is a wave there
To take me to you

I'm moving, moving away
Let's go to hawaii, just you and me
A guitar, the sound of the sea
As if it was always the first kiss

And when I'm falling down
I hope there is a wave there
To take me to you

And now I'm falling down
I hope there is a wave there
To take me to you

All eyes of hatred, sadness
Maybe they don't know the love
But he is among us

And now I'm falling down
I hope there is a wave there
To take me to you
