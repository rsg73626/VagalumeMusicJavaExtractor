FRAGILE GIRL

You're a fragile girl or at least you appear to be
That's the point of view that's vanishing right off of the screen
And the first rays stagger through a sawdust haze
To unveil a vision that gives off the illusion that you're gonna stay 
here with me

The moonlit road is aglow it's flashing like an arrow
and you're stealing fire everywhere that you go

You're angels are anchored and they can't get very far
And I'm hellbent on keeping things just the way that they are
You're on the blink and movin' without electricity
And it takes a while to sink in, but it's picking up velocity

You're not too broken up (too broken up)
You're not too broken up (too broken up)
and I can't think too much about what it means

'Cause you're a fragile girl or at least you appear to be
that's the point of view that's vanishing right off of the screen

The moonlit road is aglow it's flashing like an arrow
and you're stealing fire everywhere that you go
(Stealing fire) Stealing fire everywhere that you go, oh yeah
Everywhere that you go, oh yeah
