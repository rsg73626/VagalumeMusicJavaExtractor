POINT DEXTER (YOU NANCY BOY)

Point Dexter Get you cap on straight
For several years you been a loser
And your have been abuse, abused

It can only get worse
Your hated by your piers
Point Dexter why don't you just go home
You're not going to get any action tonight


Nancy boy they will all say, Nancy boy they will all say
Point Dexter, he needs a new life,
Point Dexter still afraid of the night
Point Dexter needs new friends,
Point Dexter you have too much time on your hands

You Nancy boy
You Nancy boy
You Nancy boy

It can only get worse
Your hated by your piers
Point Dexter why don't you just go home
You're not going to get any action tonight

Point Dexter told you not to come here anymore
Point Dexter you amount to nothing, Point Dexter don't hang around
Here, or your going to be put out to dry

You wussie
You Nancy Boy
