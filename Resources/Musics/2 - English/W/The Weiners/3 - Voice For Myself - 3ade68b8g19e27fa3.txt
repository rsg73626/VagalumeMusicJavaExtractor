VOICE FOR MYSELF

Screwed By the System again
Judging on what these words mean
they cant relate,opinions on what
the true meaning is,give me a
break

you dont know
You cant relate
you judge
you are fake

Some body tell me whats going on
i have the right to express my self,
to speak the words i wish to say
no matter who dosint want to here,
they can go away

Seems like i cant say what i feel
something against me?
somthing you dont like
well you can fuck your self
for all i care

You dont know
you cant relate
you judge
you are fake

who are you to say what is acceptable
who the fuck are you to say what i can
who the fuck are you tell me what i can and cant do
just tell me who the fuck are you
