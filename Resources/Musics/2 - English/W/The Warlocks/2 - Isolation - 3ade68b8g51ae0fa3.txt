ISOLATION

isolation

the sun comes out but it brings me no, happiness
the flowers are in bloom but it's meaningless to me unless i see you
i can't look up to see the rainbow in your eyes when i'm all alone
my mind just prints your picture in my head when your not there

i've never felt like this before, i don't know what to do 
i don't wanna leave I don't wanna move oh 
i see darkness in her eyes, and darkness in her heart oh 
the curtains are all closed and the choice was made by me

isolation
