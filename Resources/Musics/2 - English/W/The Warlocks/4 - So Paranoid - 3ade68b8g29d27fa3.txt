SO PARANOID

Wait my love i mean get out of here
the switches are insane
my heads a mess and my souls on
with tears dripping from the side
of hell

but now i have to sing
i’m wound up dizzy and i’m so paranoid

i started out sober
but soon i broke down too
my head turned into a trash can
it feels like death it feels like hell
like hell

but now i have to sing
i’m wound up dizzy and i’m so paranoid
