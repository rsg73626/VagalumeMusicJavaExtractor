WHIPS OF MERCY

i don't know how to 
love only her
she looks at me through an
magnifying hourglass

i can't seem to hold faith 
with all the candy in here
i just seem to want
only things i can't have

i always want you near
i always want you near me
blessed with your whips of mercy
speech stained of white glass

you sound as though you been lost 
or tired of playing games
i'll just try and see it your way
but i can't help feeling low
