ITS JUST LIKE SURGERY

i’m starting to 
lose my mind but I can see now
and the nova cane 
it makes me laugh when i’m not with you
oh there’s no one else 
that makes me feel the way that you do 

its just like surgery 
its just like surgery 

you operate 
like no one else I know
and your scalpel cuts
deep, clean right through my heart, and through my mind
oh
oh

its just like surgery 
its just like surgery
