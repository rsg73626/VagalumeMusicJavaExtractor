HOUSE OF GLASS

trip down the hallway, i know she must be moving
walk through easter eggs, exploding and always losing
things get loose then turned around like a rainbow magnet
take the bus but don't get in i feel the freight train is comming

and her house is made fo glass of glass
and her house is made fo glass of glass

she must feel lost inside like a moving misused golden puzzle
the puzzles missing pieces and all she wants is her canteen
cartwheel down the side walk, but don't for get to use the speakers i gave you
i must of missed a turn somewhere cause i almost feel through the broken window

and her house is made fo glass of glass
and her house is made fo glass of glass
