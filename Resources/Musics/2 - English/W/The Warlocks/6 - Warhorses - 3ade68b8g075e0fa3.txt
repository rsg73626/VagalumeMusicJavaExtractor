WARHORSES

you traveled way to long 
to lose your dusty girl
its so fucked up and unfair
from the snow covered shoes she wore 

you step back and then explode
its so unfair to taste t.v.
but the black and white colored snow
puts you to bed and to sleep

the shots ring out
and kill the horses head
its death at your door
at your door

from my war covered shoes
from my war covered shoes
