TAKIN' OVA

As we lead MC's into battle
I stand ground with Tee Studios as my castle
Roaming thru my original bracelands
Visiualizing my verbal style thru spray cans
Takin ova building empires like Caesar
Try to screw me and I Scrooge you like Ebenezer
Nice gals on the mic fights for the grand prize
N-Light-N be the torch in the force of the midnight

Camelot be turning
98-3 times Merlin casting spells leaving walls burning
Two shadow knights riding through the wood sites
Mic carriers in the moon light
Soon fight, battle, whom write the remedy
Voice maleficence, slingin like Yosemite
Benevolance versus malevolance
You represent irrelevance
We're heaven sent elegance!

Telling tales with a dark age relevance
The men, mc's talked about in the past tense

Takin ova, we be the legatees to the rap legacy
Sereneties of the industry
Takin ova! 

It's the north sea defender, storm outsender
Scandinavian, Iberian islander
T.P! Theological Prophecies

I give you beliefs, Tiara energies

Fuck 'em in the streets V.O.T chase you out of town
the sound men about to catch another beat down
Yo, Tee lay the beat down
Who am I ?
The best Norwegian producer on the M-I

I take you to the sea, the open type
On any open MIC I shine, Saint Like
Glorious! Viviende god apaladre
I'm sailing in with the Spanish Armada

From the horseback to a 24 track recorder
My bees be walkin the water, crossin the border
Shouts to Cod 2 and the crew C.O.D
Let's whack these others crews like cap M-P-C's

Kid Karma drop the drama, shiny armor Ivanhoe
Seven swords swinging soldiers in the ???
Harrow head heroes from beyond the 7 meadows
Tellin tough tales from the backside of the meadow
We can never settle, battle for the line over kings
Clingin steel and reprint shields is what we bring
Tee takes the lead, like Arthur we won't fail
Adventures awaits, search for the Holy Grail!

The Mudstained Trubadour
Masquerader, element to carry through for my cause
Pearly white teeth connected to my jaws
I pause a bit
To let my palms get in position
Play the role out of suspicion
My mission is sparklin clear
And I won't fail, V.O.T in my back
T.P must prevail, Royalty
Suckers better pay a fee
A very important point is loyalty
Now I reveal my disguise
You guys see blury flashes of my eyes
Which are evil not sober
Lettin you know T.P is
Takin Ova!![Echoes]

Takin Ova
Oh, you crossed over, then you got bucked and knocked over!
