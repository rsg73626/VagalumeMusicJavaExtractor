NONE OF THE ABOVE

 All night restaurant, North Kildonan. Luke warm coffee tastes like soap. I 
trace your outline in spilled sugar, killing time and killing hope. This brand 
new strip mall chews on farmland as we fish for someone to blame. But we 
communicate in questions, and all our answers sound the same. Under sputtering 
flourescents, after re-fills are re-filled. Negotiations at a stand-still, 
spoon and rolling saucer stilled. If you ask how I got so bitter, I'll ask how 
you got so vain. And all our questions blur together. The answers always sound 
the same. We can't look at one another. I'll say something thoughtful soon, but 
I can't listen to the quiet so I hum this mindless tune I stole from some dumb 
country-rock star. I don't even know his name. It's like my stupid little 
questions: the answers always sound the same.Tell me why I have to miss you so. 
Tell me why we sound so lame. Why we communicate in questions and all our 
answers sound the same.
