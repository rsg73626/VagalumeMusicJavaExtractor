SLIPS AND TANGLES

we're rolling neon lights and slinking purple skies squeeze out soft regrets from all our lives as i greet another door that opens in to that place that we repeatedly begin i'm tangled up in tries slipping on i wonder why i face affection not embrace another urban wasteland thick with fears i see lights that shine like frozen television tears or dying embers of another day please tell me what it is i i wanna say i'm tangled up in tries slipping on i wonder why i face affection not embrace affection not embrace
