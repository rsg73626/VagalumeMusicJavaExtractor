MARYLAND BRIDGE

I woke you up at four this morning
To whimper and to whine
To hear myself through spit and crackle
Of a poor long distance line
Twelve clever ways to say I love you
With words that always fail
Hang up and light a cigarette
Sit waiting for the mail
Some flyers from department stores
A, another get rich plan
A bill or two, some shampoo and a note from Ed McMann
Although youâ€™ll always be the one in which I will confide
Sometimes youâ€™re the razor on my private water slide

Chorus:
By the way, I got your letter yesterday
It said thereâ€™s no need to be sad
It said that some things would never ever change
But that some already had
And Iâ€™d heard it from the corner of my ear
How that voice makes things right
And Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s something more than memory
Across the Maryland bridge tonight

How ominous these undercurrents
They crowd me now it seems
And every time I meet you in the darkness of my dreams
Itâ€™s likely that Iâ€™ll turn around and parody myself
Imagine weâ€™re in different places
Pretend weâ€™re someone else
I can be J. Edgar Hoover
You be JFK
As power hungry egocentrics
We'll paper fight the nights away
sometimes youâ€™re my nemesis
When I am paranoid
Sometimes I have doubts and worries
Too strong to avoid

Chorus

Maryland bridge tonight
