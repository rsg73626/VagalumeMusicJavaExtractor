THE TALE OF TWO DOVES

So you've heard the tale of the man
who went sinking deep into love
like a dove

I remember him
had his eyes open wide to life
'til the time the love died

He was screaming into life

So you're heard the tale of the girl
who went sinking deep into mud
after love

She the black and blue
she who never knew how to cry
at the time her love died

She was screaming into life
