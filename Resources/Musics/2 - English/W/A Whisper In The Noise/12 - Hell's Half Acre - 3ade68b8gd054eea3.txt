HELL'S HALF ACRE

Rolling,
like fronts of weather
their wrath will cheat rape change shape and move to the next shamed endeavor
we’re all rolling together, like sons of Cain
and by time you’ll find something you can’t shake away

to cure you
to kill you
to cool you
to kill you

rolling
all flocks of severed
no giftings of anecdotes wrote will guide you on the next joke better
we're in this together, like sons of Cain
now tell me which way's best left not left for the blame

to cure you
to kill you
to cool you
to kill you

don't walk to coming back
don't walk out coming back
don't walk out to coming back
don't walk out comparing why
don't walk out to my surprise
don't walk out comparing why

to cure you
to kill you
to cool you
to kill you
