THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN

come gather ‘round people where ever you roam
and admit that the waters around you have grown
accept it that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone
and if your time to you is worth saving
well you better start swimming or sink like a stone
for the times they are a-changin’

come writers and critics who prophesize with pen
keep your eyes wide the change won’t come again
don’t speak too soon when the wheel’s still in spin
the old road is rapidly aging
and the losers now will be later to win
‘cause the times they are a-changin’

come senator, congressmen, please heed the cause
don’t stand in the doorway or block up the halls
for he who gets hurt will be he who has stalled
and the battle outside that is raging
will soon shake you’re windows and rattle your walls
for the times they are a-changin’
