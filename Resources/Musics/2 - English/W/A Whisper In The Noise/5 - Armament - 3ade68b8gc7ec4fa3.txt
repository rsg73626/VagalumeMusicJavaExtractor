ARMAMENT

To defiance you align us
in this situation mona lisa over vista
hid of condemnation

I was standing next to water
all around me dragonfly
in the distance your horizon
setting violent to the sky

bell the wetter as defender
in this contravention now allegiance will
defeat us hid of observations

I was standing next to water
all around me dragonfly
in the distance your horizon
setting violent to the sky

I want all of this to be gone
I want all of this to die
I want hope to ring as virtue
not as final compromise
