THE SOUNDING LINE

will this imprint last forever
will the centuries erode
everyone and everything you knew before

through the distant coming echoes
sounding oh so cold and crass
did you hear the sounding line

don’t speak too soon
you’re driving blind
heading for a curve

through the cameras at my distance
I saw a songbird lost in heat
trembling, like I never saw before

don’t speak too soon
the consequence will come down
in a burning fire of rain

don’t wait too long
the aftermath
will hit you like a biblical device
on man

will this imprint last forever
will the centuries erode
everyone and everything you knew before
