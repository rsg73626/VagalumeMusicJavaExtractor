IN THE DARK

there's a new school biting on a fishhook
read a new rule written to the old book
got the news but they change what they take from it
in the dark when they're looking at the truth of it... yeah
dim the lights, got a brand new distraction
turn them on, got the new vibration
please the sun, got a wait to said some...
in the dark but I can't quit get from... yeah
