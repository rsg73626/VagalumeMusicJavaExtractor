AS THE BLUEBIRD SINGS

Rolling, across the sands
hiding the blood, in history
by those who won
as the blue bird sings
pure deeds are spent
and the chalk man frins
as we forget

I had a dream
that we could see
something farther than we now see
as a child would dream
before consuming everything
on the course to hell

linus has been kidnapped
live news reports
tap tap tap tap
we're born to this
as debt pays debt
and the bluebird sings
as we forget

I had a dream
that we could see
something farther than we now see
as a child
I will keep
just as long as we believe
in love

do you care about this
more than anyone else
'cause I don't care about this
more than anyone else
in love
do you care about this
really care about this

I wish it was so
