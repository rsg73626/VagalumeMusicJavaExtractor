HAVOC

the havoc in reign
the salt on injury
constant struggle in loss of gravity
mayhem controlled the knife twisting
in a steady battle exiting dignity
delusion in tenure prevailing gospel
continual labors burning our hours
the lapse of reason for whatever the reason
ceaseless confusion holding our power

do you know where we are going
I'm lost to where we are

the symmetry of natural disaster
is curbed to bleeding through the cracks
to fix in your words
and it perverse to natural birth
as i.d. thefts inherit the earth
the current in motion pulling below us

do you know where we are going
I'm lost to where we are
do you feel tied to living,
on the far side of your control

the end of america is fixed in the merge
the end of america is fixed in numbers

do you know where we are going
I'm lost to where we are
do you feel tied to living,
on the far side of your control
