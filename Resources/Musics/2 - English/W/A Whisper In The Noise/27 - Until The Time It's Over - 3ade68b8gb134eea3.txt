UNTIL THE TIME IT'S OVER

everybody's happy
once in a while this seems for real
until the time it's over
forget, taking those pills
they won't change,
the nature of our nature

life's a bitch
and he won't have you telling her
where she will take you

times a line they draw* to hold us
to the thought the grave will hold us

makeshift, memories fill our minds with worms,
that eat the wide eye lenses

beauty, it needs to be ill
in order to feel the pain that rests beside it

life's a bitch
and she won't have you telling him
where she will take you

times a line they draw* to hold us
to the thought the grave will hold us
