THIS TIME, IT'S

this time it's
indifferent
to our walk and that is for real
less pray on ungodly chase
be patient, love,
in hope we endure

this time it's
indifferent
to our walk and that is for real
a car crash
a cancer's fast
be mindful, love, humble and near
this time it's unprejudiced
careless, love,
loose and unclear

it's the right place
the only place
be patient, love,
nothing's for sure
it's the right place
the only place
be patient, love,
nothing's for sure
