A NEW DAWN

is anyone awake here?..
is anyone afloat?..

weakened by the hunger to be reborn?
either way the tempered be heedful of source
yet neither obsequious or of remorse

oooh
I wait for a new dawn
to hold something more than something of old
are you yet awake, dear, apon qui vive?
please don't feel mistaken of faction to be
the air of acedia begets the thunder beings
destitution rings, love, recall the dream

oooh
I wait for a new dawn
to hold something more than something
I refrain
I feel the same
cause i really want to
I really want to I really want to stay
I really want to I really want to I really want to stay
I really want to stay for something
I really want to stay
please don't forget what the thought burns away
