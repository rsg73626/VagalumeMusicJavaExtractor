THE SONG YOU HATE

these are the dark days painted in greys
we only give a fuck if we don't get paid
we'll suck cock on long walks to the beach
with an amway sunset
the cute boys, cute girls walk this line
with a real big smile
stop bringing me back to this place
and get that cold smile off of your face
you're too weak, too strong, too dumb, too blond,
too old, too young, too right, too wrong,
too broke to get rich, too rich to give a shit,
too fucking lazy, a real fucking crazy,
using all the bad drugs, should be on these drugs,
not informed to vote, get a 401k
stop bringing me back to this place
and get that cold smile off of your face...
these are the dark days painted in greys...
stop bringing me back to this place
and get that cold smile off of your face...
