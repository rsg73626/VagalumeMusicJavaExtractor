WALL OF YOU

all of the fear that I seed in me
all of the most basic needs of me
all of the dreams I have that won't come true
pale at the sight of the wall of you
I feel like hanging on to you all the time
I feel like hanging on to you all the time
I feel like letting go will break my heart
I feel like hanging on to you for a time... forever more.
