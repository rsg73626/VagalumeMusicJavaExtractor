ANYMORE

anymore, I wonder... I wonder what we're falling for
anymore, I wonder... break boy... break for the shore
If didn't mean that much
It never meant you'd understand
crashing into the ground feels better than to drown
anymore, I wonder... I wonder what we're hiding for
anymore, I wonder... cause boy you ain't that far from the shore
It didn't mean that much
It never meant you'd understand
crashing into the ground feels better than to drown
