SILENCE

There is this silence in the room
from when I had last assumed
you could feel the way I do
but that was never true

don't fret, it was a mistake
still I feel I'm out of place
so I'll go where I can feel
something that's far from being real
and daydream away

Well, here I am once again
by me the one undying friend
but I lose the sight of this
I my own fright of this
and daydream away
