THROUGH WOUNDS WE SOON WILL STITCH

So you've heard that the world is full of... shit
take it in through wounds we soon will... stitch
played the fool for far too long to... quit
oh so tired we really face this

well it's a long drop in a... deep sea
if we don't heed... we're drowning
now than far from free
how far does it have to be

to climb....above
to climb....above

I'm getting ready for the wrecking ball
at the walls of basic needs
it's closer now than you can see
how close does it have to be

to climb....above
to climb....above
