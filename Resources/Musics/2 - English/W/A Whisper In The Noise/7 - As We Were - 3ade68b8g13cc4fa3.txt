AS WE WERE

As we were
as before
comes to be
nevermore

the fool
to regret
to repent
to forget

As our hurt
devestates
as our hopes
dissipate

Turning joy
into pain
as our love
turns in vain

So we now
close the door
as we were
nevermore

Day of birth
be alive
leaning now
to survive

To move on
without ache
humbler
within grace

Within hope
dawn of spring
to the start
all that sadness brings
