YOU, THE ORPHAN

as the cities
burn and smoke
all you needed
is it right there?..
within your reach?
you are truly alone
now an orphan
crying 'mama'
crying 'home'

as you fall
back to nothing
as you fall
back to nothing

all you needed
economic
is anemic
as after it all
you, the orphan,
crying 'mama'
crying 'home

as you fall
back to nothing
as you fall
back to nothing

I am pleading
come back home
come back home
come back home
come back home
come back home
come back home
come back home
come back home
come back home

as you fall
back to nothing
as you fall (come back home)
back to nothing (come back home)
as you fall(come back home)
back to nothing(come back home)
as you fall (come back home)
back to nothing
