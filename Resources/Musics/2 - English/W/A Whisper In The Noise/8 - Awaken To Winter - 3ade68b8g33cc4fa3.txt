AWAKEN TO WINTER

Awaken to winter
young child
here it has come
Awaken
my dear love
a new day's begun
Suffer the many
their labours undone
so calm down, calm down, calm me down calm down

Awaken to winter
young child
your labours undone
The elders around you
no longer need laughter
or shrug 
So calm down
calm down, calm me down, calm down

Distance yourself in presence
to ghost of habit
Deliverence hosts
a severence thwart to pattern

Imagine a place made for us
far from it here
of far and rust
so calm down, calm down, calm me down, calm down..
