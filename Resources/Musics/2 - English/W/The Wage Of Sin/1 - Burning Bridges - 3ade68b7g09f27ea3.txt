BURNING BRIDGES

I was always taught 
To help a friend when they fall
Apparently you weren't
Left me bashed against the wall


You turned your back on me
Covered your ears from my cries
Everything you claim to be
Is a fa√ßade made up of lies

Held down
Shoved around
Used and Thrown away
After all I've done for you
How can you treat me this way?

How could I defend you? 
Then take all the blame?
I was put through hell and back
Plus left with all this shame

Why should I be mortified
When what I did was brave?
You all mean nothing now
When in need I was betrayed


When you were choking 
I hurried by your side
Now its time to sacrifice
And all you do is hide

Held down 
Shoved around
Used and Thrown away
After all I've done for you
How can you treat me this way?

How could I defend you? 
Then take all the blame?
I was put through hell and back
Plus left with all this shame

You pretended not to notice
You pretended not to care
How do I deserve this?
Life is so unfair.
