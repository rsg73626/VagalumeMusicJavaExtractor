FIRST-BORN AGAINST

You question my everything
I am not "perfect"
Not "imperfect"
But human

Disappointment's all too familiar
That's the last thing I wanted to be to you
I'm sinking deeper.
I'm falling harder. 

I can't get much lower. 
I've lost control. 
In hysterics over everything
In control of nothing
Drained by your words.
Drained by your actions.

My dreams like fire in my eyes, burning. Burn out. Have left me with these scars.
My aspirations extinguished by your oceans of excuses. I'm drowning in them now.

Anything I've ever done is nothing in your eyes.


Of your blood I'm born.
Of your word I die.
Born against you.
