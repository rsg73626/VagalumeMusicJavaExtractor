OPEN DOORS

Take control
It's your life


There are things called hard work and dedication
Taking what's given to you won't lead you to your destination
So take control of yourself 
Do those things which you choose
Don't let others plan your fate or you'll continue loose


Don't come to me for advice
I've given all I have to give
When will you realize
That this is your life to live

Choose your own path
Make your own way 
Control your destiny


You choose your own path in life 
No one to blame but you
You choose your own path in life
Do it before you're through


(Face down from the stars, your back away from fate. You cannot delay your destiny. So hard to ignore. Life won't live for you and I can't make believe. Your fate is yours.)


[ Your life-Your death. Your fate is up to you.]

Take control
It's your life

All you do is complain
I have no pity for you
Make choices of your own
It's the way to get through


You choose your own path in life 
No one to blame but you
You choose your own path in life
Do it before you're through


(I can't sit back and watch you fail yourself at your own life. I can't let you sit here waiting for your own life.)


[Your life-Your death. Your fate is up to you]

I see the way you sit there
Unproductive
Unhappy
You don't want to fight for anything
And I wont sit there with you


I see the way you give in
Intimidated
Inactive
You don't want to fight for anything.
And I wont give in with you


Choose your own path- Make your own way 
(I can't watch you fail yourself.)
Choose your own path- Control your destiny
