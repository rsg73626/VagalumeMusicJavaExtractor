WHEN I BROKE YOUR HEART I SHATTERED MINE

Alone. I cry.
I'm alone and it won't change.
Alone. I'm nothing.
My heart is gone and I'm to blame.
Alone. I cry
Because I know love isn't real
Alone. I'm nothing
Destroyed my hope, I'll never feel.


With no one I am nothing. Alone until the end of time. 
When I broke your heart I shattered mine.
