LOST FAITH

Rip my eyes out I dont want to see this self destructive world killing each day. 
Rip my ears off I dont want to hear hurtful words diminishing integrity
Rip my hands off I dont want to feel cold embraces from people with no souls
Rip my heart out I cant bare to live, faith is gone forever and wont come back to me.

What hope is there? Give me reason to be. I've lost faith in humanity. 



Rip my ears off
Rip my eyes out 
Rip my hands off
Rip my heart out

I detest the disregard
I abhor the neglect, the abuse, the disrepect, the suffering in this world.
