SEVERED

My greatest fear is living my life
Because the unknown is being alone
The nightmares at night will never cease
Eyes open to darkness, a tunnel with no end
Screaming at shadows of what used to be
But knowing there is nothing
Because I threw it all away

Your accusations echo in my ears
they will for the rest of my life
My own misery - My responsibility
I will be the one to end it

Nothing-Will replace what is lost
Nothing- Will change what occurs in the end
Nothing- Will be what is left of my life
Nothing- Can make my dead heart beat again

This is my life.



The time will come when I'll see I was wrong
But time can never forgive what was done
My sadness is endless like sirens at night
This is my life. 

Nothing-Will replace what is lost
Nothing- Will change what occurs in the end
Nothing- Will be what is left of my life
Nothing- Can make my dead heart beat again


Your accusations echo in my ears
They will for the rest of my life
My own misery - My responsibility
I will be the one to end it
