CAST AWAY

I once felt so close to you
That we were as one
I once felt so close to you
That I loved you
Now everything has changed


How could I be so wrong?
You don't deserve me
I never deserved you.


I never wanted to feel this pain
I never wanted this misery
I should have known something so passionate
Would end up killing me


We would have been perfect
Had you not deceived me
We would have been happy
Had you not destroyed me
We could be together 
Had you not posed such a treat
I cannot let you do this to me again


Look into my eyes - Tell me what your intentions were
Look into my eyes - See my hatred for you
I spit on your callousness
I cry because I fell for it
I cry because I fell for you
Just to be cast away


I never wanted to feel this pain
I never wanted this misery
I should have known something so passionate
Would end up killing me


How could you do this to me?
I've become the unwanted skin
Receding from my cocoon-
And for you to peel
This is not what you like.
Come! Please! Speak at me!

I have been cast away
You will be cast away
The next time I reach for you will be the last touch you ever feel


Now it's time for me to take this knife that you've placed in my back 
and use it to cut you into a million pieces
Like what you did to my heart
Dissect you rather than these memories 
You're nothing now.
