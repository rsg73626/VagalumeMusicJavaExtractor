INDEPENDENCE

Drink it up 
'Till you can't stop
Intoxicate your mind 
Resistance drops 
Blaming a drink for your actions is the only way you find satisfaction.
Too much of anything leads to a life without identity.


Dependence on substance to set you free only keeps you in captivity.
Slowly dying the more you consume. Avoiding reality will bring about your doom.

Purification vs. intoxication
Dependable or dependant?

I can't look into those glassy eyes.
I can't listen anymore to your cries.
Hope it's not late when you realize you're killing yourself.


Take this hit 
Take this trip
Soon your grasp of control starts to slip
Choosing these things over your friends will be a means to your ends.
Too much of anything leads to a life without identity.

Dependence on substance to set you free only keeps you in captivity.
Slowly dying the more you consume. Avoiding reality will bring about your doom.

Purification vs. intoxication
Dependable or dependant?

I can't look into those glassy eyes.
I can't listen anymore to your cries.
Hope it's not late when you realize you're killing yourself.
