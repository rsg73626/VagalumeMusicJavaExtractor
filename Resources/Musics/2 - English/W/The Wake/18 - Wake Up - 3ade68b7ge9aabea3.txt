WAKE UP

There's people talking
They talk about me
They know my name,
They think they know everything
But they don't know anything
About me

Give me a dance floor?
Give me a DJ?
Play me a record, forget what they say
Cause I need to go
Need to get away tonight

I put my make up on saturday night
I try to make it happen
Try make it alright
I know I make mistakes
I'm living life in a day
It's never really easy
But it's ok

Chorus:
Wake up! Wake up!
On a saturday night
Could be New York
Maybe Hollywood and vine
London, Paris maybe Tokyo
Something's going on
Anywhere I go tonight, tonight
Get tonight!

The cities restless
It's all arround me
People in motion
Sick of all the same routines
And they need to go
They need to get away tonight!

I put my make up on saturday night
I try to make it happen
Try make it alright
I know I make mistakes
I'm living life in a day
It's never realy easy
But it's ok

Repeat Chorus

People all around you
Everywhere that you go
People all around you
They don't really know you
Everybody is watching
Like it's some kind of show
Everybody is watching
They don't really know you tonight
(They don't really know you)
(They don't really know you)
And forever

Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

Wake up! Wake up!
On a saturday night
Could be New York
Maybe Hollywood and vine
London, Paris maybe Tokyo
Something's going on
Anywhere I go...

Wake up! Wake up!
On a saturday night
Could be New York
Maybe Hollywood and vine
London, Paris maybe Tokyo
Something's going on
Anywhere I go tonight, tonight
Get tonight!
