PALE SPECTRE

A shuddering vision appeared one day at the door of my house
Pale spectre and shadow, as if the nose was a hole in the sky
A shivering figure once dragged from the sea like a loathsome head
Undressing before me, then tearing its flesh with demented glee
Sha la la la la x 2
Crept into the hallway, already at home on the carpet and walls
Unpacking a suitcase, pale spectre in spare room and under my feet
Now Jove he was half asleep for several hours that afternoon
This unwanted creature crawled into a corner crying â€˜Where is the moon?'
Sha la la la la x 2
Pale spectre and shadow cried â€˜Where is the moon tonight? It is like an enormous light.'
And I replied
Heaven'll help you out visitant, Heaven'll help you out x 2
Pale spectre and shadow said 'Your tale is not quite right. It is just an outrageous lie.'
And I can't deny
Pale spectre and shadow cried â€˜Where is the moon tonight? It is like an enormous light.'
And I replied
I said sha la la la laâ
