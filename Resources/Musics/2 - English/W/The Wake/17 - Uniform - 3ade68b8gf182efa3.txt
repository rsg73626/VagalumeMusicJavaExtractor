UNIFORM

It's not a game anymore
It's not the same anymore
Do you remember so long ago?
The battle is over and I'm coming home
But you're not here anymore
It's not the past anymore
Away from danger
Can you stay forever?
But you're not here anymore
It's not the past anymore
It takes a long time
It takes a long time
This is a cross
This is a cross
Do you remember so long ago?
The war is over and I'm coming home
It's over now

Do you remember?
The battle is over
But you're not here anymore
It's not the past anymore
Away from danger
Can you stay forever?
But you're not here anymore
It's not the past anymore
It takes a long time
It takes a long time
This is a cross
This is a cross
Do you remember so long ago?
The war is over and I'm coming home
It's over now
Think it over now
