DARKNESS OF MINE

Again you see me me walking here
Nobody near just you and me
In my own nest - Frustrations nest
So you came - You came into my life
So you peeled me - Debarked this tree
That you could see under my skin
Look far ahead - I am not here
Just an illusion made of hate

[chorus]
Cought in the life again
No-one but you can see
I'm cought in this hell-wheel of life again
Cought in the world of lies
Nothing but death in my eyes
I'm cought and i cant find the way out

As we're stuck into this world of fire
Nobody can hear my endless desires
I'm all alone there's nobody in here
Nobody can save me from myself

[Solos: Lempinen]
