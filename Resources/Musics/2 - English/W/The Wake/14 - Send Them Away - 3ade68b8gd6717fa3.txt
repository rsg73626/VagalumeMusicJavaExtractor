SEND THEM AWAY

And I saw you in my dream
'I can tell by your eyes that you've been crying'
But you left it all for me
All the places we know and all the faces
All the faces we know, all the places to go
Thunderclouds in stormy skies
We walked across the bridge of sighs
Shall we stop to say hellos?
And I saw you in my dream
'I can tell by your eyes that you've been crying'
But you left it all for me
All the places we know and all the faces
All the faces we know, all the places to go
(Oh how can I escape from you?)
Thunderclouds in stormy skies
We walked across the bridge of sighs
Shall we stop to say hellos?
'But that's the way it goes'
That's the way love grows
