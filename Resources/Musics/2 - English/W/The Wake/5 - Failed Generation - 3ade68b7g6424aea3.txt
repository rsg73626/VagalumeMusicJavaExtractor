FAILED GENERATION

As we're heading for the world-oblivion, gathering to same
As we're waiting for the end that's surely making its way
Underneath the skin there are splinters of dead men
Pieces of dead souls which are heading towards dead-end

[chorus]
If you stare to its eyes they look back
And reflecting all its rage
These are the eyes of the end
Redeeming all that's left

Exposing souls to the poison-mass the deadly choice of grace
Waving goodbyes to eternity and passing by the grief
The world is staring to eternal darkness and to the eyes of death
Waving goodbyes to eternity and passing by the grief

Slowly watch you die the suicidal mind of mine
Nevermore to breath the same air
When you are close to the ground and you see the falling star

The final stage of my existing rage - of my distorted faith
Staring towards utopia - Another dying breed
My soul is pierced and the road is filled with hate
Final sunset making its way

[Solos: Lempinen, Luttinen]
