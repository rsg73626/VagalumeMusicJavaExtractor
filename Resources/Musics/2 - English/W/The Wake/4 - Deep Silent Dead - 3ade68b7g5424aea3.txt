DEEP SILENT DEAD

Hard to be
Hard to see
Body beaten - Life became your tomb
You lost your grip - You're walking with
The herd of sheep

Crawling
Suffering
Life left you to oblivion
You wanted this - You beg for this
It's now in your hands

[chorus]
It's what you want now when you scream my name
Oh how you wish for things to be the same
This is no more than the end
Again you lost your control...

While awake point your hate
Killing clichÂ© - Again you reap
It's in the eyes of victims passed;
'This is the end'

Bloodred eyes
Hollow mind
Were waiting for your arrival
Crystallize - Bring the light
Breed the seed of hate!

[Solos: Luttinen]
