HERE COMES EVERYBODY

The river runs into the sea
The sun must shine today
As my imagination is about to slip away
Milk and honey waiting for me on the other side
It's early in the morning
And I thought I heard you
I miss you
I miss you
You know I miss you
When I'm not with you
Who kissed you?
Who kissed you?
You know I miss you
When I'm not with you
Milk and honey waiting for me on the other side
I'll never fall in love again
But you could change my mind
I miss you
I miss you
You know I miss you
When I'm not with you
I lost you in a lonely crowd
You wanted to be free
You wanted to be somone else
I'll always disagree
Milk and honey waiting for me on the other side
It's late at night then almost light
I thought I heard you
I miss you
I miss you
You know I miss you
When I'm not with you
Who kissed you?
Who kissed you?
You know I miss you
When I'm not with you

Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me on sunday
When I'm with you
I can see myself falling to the ground
When I'm not with you
I can watch the leaves falling to the ground
When I'm with you
I can see myself falling to the ground
When I'm not with you
I can watch the leaves falling to the ground
When I'm not with you
I can hear your voice calling, calling, calling
When I'm with you
I can see myself falling to the ground
When I'm not with you
I can watch the leaves falling, falling, falling
When I'm not with you
I can watch the leaves falling to the ground
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
You kissed him on sunday
