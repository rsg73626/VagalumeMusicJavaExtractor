JUDAS

Now I know what friends are for
They call the name I must ignore
They make the same mistakes again
Now I know they laugh alone

They call the name I must not hear
They call the name I must ignore
Now I know what friends are for
One day it will come to this

One day I will say my sentence
One day I will make decisions
One day it will come to this
I hear the name dropped with a kiss

They call the name I must not hear
I live in hope, I live in fear
A fear of god, the god of love
The god of love, the god above

Now I know they call the name
The same mistakes I never learn
I must not hear, I must ignore
Now I know what friends are for
The god of love, the god above
