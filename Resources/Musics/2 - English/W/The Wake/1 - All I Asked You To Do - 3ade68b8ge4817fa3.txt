ALL I ASKED YOU TO DO

I knew a girl who lived a wonderful life
She was a beautiful girl
She had a home, a car, somewhere to go
Somewhere to go every night
And she always seemed so carefree
She always seemed so kind
Perhaps she wouldn't recognise me
After all of this time
Here is my lonely broken heart
My broken ehart
How can you be so cruel to me?
A woman should be loved, true love must be true
All I asked you to do was to talk to me
All I asked you to do

She was told that love is a wonderful thing
She never dared to ask why
She was told that life is a wondrous thing
Well, everyone seems to get by
And she always seemed so carefree
She always seemed so kind
Perhaps I wouldn't recognise her
After all this time
Here is my lonely broken heart
My broken ehart
How can you be so cruel to me?
A woman should be loved, true love must be true
All I asked you to do was to dance with me
All I asked you to do
