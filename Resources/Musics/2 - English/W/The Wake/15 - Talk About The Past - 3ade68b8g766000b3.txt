TALK ABOUT THE PAST

I believe you when you talk about the past
And I believe that you and I are friends at last
All the silence in this world won't change my mind
Talk about tomorrow or another time
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Have you heard the good news everybody is a star?
Have you heard the good news everybody works so hard?
I believe you always wanted emptiness
And I remember I was full of happiness
All the money in this world won't change my mind
You can save your money for another time
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Have you heard the good news everybody is a star?
Have you heard the good news everybody works so hard?
