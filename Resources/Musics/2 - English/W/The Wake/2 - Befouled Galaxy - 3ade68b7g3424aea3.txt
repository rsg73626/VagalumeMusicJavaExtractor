BEFOULED GALAXY

Heal my wounds
Handle with care
Leave me be - Just another dying day in this galaxy

Realised that I'm just one of gods creations
Another soul in this world-illusion
Beneath this darkest death division
Want to leave it behind and die tomorrow

[chorus]
Fading the light is lost
Into hiding - This place is crossed
Dividing to this befouled galaxy

Touched the never and dispised all the living
This is the blind-alley among the being
Seen the never - Your eyes are proven to be wrong
Can't you hear the song of the dying world - that lives no longer?

With the spiral of death hanging over me
I'm no longer me - Just too blind to see
That there is no truth inside of this mist
And nothing lives - They rather dismiss

[Solos: Lempinen]
