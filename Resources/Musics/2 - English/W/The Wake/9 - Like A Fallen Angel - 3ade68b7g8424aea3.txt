LIKE A FALLEN ANGEL

And so it goes the deadly game
It never ends the squirrel-wheel of death is here

Forcefeeded end when life begins
It's planted in our skin too deep to be seen

Like sickest revenge in this world we depend
We suck life out of it
Like blind leading the blind we head for the end
Like machines of hate we breed death

Again I flee from my realm
The silent screams that I scream
The pain is piercing my skin
How can I wake from this dream

How can I see tomorrow
If I know my life is gone
Shivering cold - insanity
My life floats towards insanity

So load your gun with empty shells
Aim in the middle of eyes - Search for yourself
Blind leading the blind
We're at the end
To see the tortured souls beyond eternal..

And so you flee from realm again
So young, so pure, so soon it ends
It ends..

Load your rage
Aim for the head
To see the tortured souls beyond eternal

Leave the insanity
Head for humanity
We have said our final words again
Again..
