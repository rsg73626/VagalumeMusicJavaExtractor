MELANCHOLY MAN

Some people say that I'm a melancholy man
When all is said and done
It's just the way I am
The sun is blazing as I wander into town
A long grey overcoat which trails along the ground
And when I'm walking past the children in the park
They stop their games, they shout my name
And run behind my back
If only they could see how happy I can be
But sometimes they must look away
Or so it seems to me
I think I'll always be a melancholy man
I know when all is said and done
It's just the way I am
But if you have the time
Please listen while you can
Does anybody understand?
I'll always be a melancholy man

The sky is blue today
Here in your nowhere land
And how are you today, my melancholy man?
You saw us looking through a window of a bus
We smiled at you but you didn't smile at us
And when you're old and grey
Your days are at an end
You'll wish that you had somone who
You couls call a friend
Yet only I can see how happy you can be
Oh sometimes they must look away
Or so it seems to me
I think I'll always be a melancholy man
I know when all is said and done
It's just the way I am
But if you have the time
Please listen while you can
Does anybody understand?
I'll always be a melancholy man

When all is said and done, my melancholy man
The sky is blue today, my melancholy man
'And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry starry night
You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you'
As beautiful as you, my melancholy man
