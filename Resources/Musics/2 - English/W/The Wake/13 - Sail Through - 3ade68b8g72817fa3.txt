SAIL THROUGH

What will your friends say?
They'll say
Your problems only fade away
Like yesterday
If you close your eyes
They'll talk about you
I'm sure the things they say are
Never true
That's just like you
But please don't cry
What will your friends say?
They'll say
Your problems only fade away
Like yesterday
If you close your eyes
They'll mention your name
I'm sure the things they say are
Never true
That's just like you
But please don't cry
