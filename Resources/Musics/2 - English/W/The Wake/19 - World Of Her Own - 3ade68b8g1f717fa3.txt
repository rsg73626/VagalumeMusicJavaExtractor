WORLD OF HER OWN

I'll try to tell you everything
Well, I think you should know
One day she'll be leaving you
For a world of her own

Your world is like an empty room
With friends who come and go
One day she'll be leaving you
For a world of her own

Yes I'm sure
Tomorrows tend to be too late to
change your ways
Yesterdays are easier to imitate
At last you'll have your chance to be
Alone
At least she's living in a
World of her own
