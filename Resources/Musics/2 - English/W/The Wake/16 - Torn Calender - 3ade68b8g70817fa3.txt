TORN CALENDER

This time may be the only time
My only chance to say
So she said to me as nervously
She smiled
All I need to know is
Where did love go wrong?
Love is wrong because
The calender is torn
Love is wrong because
The calender is torn
And all the wars begin
Because the calender is torn

Let me try to explain for you
I'm trying to explain
Or am I out of reach
A sad and harmless fool?
All I need to know is
Where did love go wrong?
Love is wrong because
The calender is torn
Love is wrong because
The calender is torn
And all the wars begin
Because the calender is torn
No one listens to the words in a song
Nobody listens to the words in a song

Let me try to explain for you
I'm trying to explain
Or am I out of reach
A sad and harmless fool?
All I need to know is
Where did love go wrong?
Love is wrong because
The calender is torn
Love is wrong because
The calender is torn
And all the wars begin
Because the calender is torn
No one listens to the words in a song
Nobody listens to the words in a song
