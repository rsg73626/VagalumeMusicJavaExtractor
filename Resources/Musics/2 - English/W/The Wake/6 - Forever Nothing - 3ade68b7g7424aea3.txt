FOREVER NOTHING

I feel it pinching my skin with a needle so thin
This is the picture of my painful realm
And when I see the dawn of a new day rise
I can barely breath - I'm no longer me

It's just an emblem of reflections
Of the darkness that grows inside me
Just the killing reality
See it drowns my time - As i die

[chorus]
Cause I am here just to be with you
Nobody near..
Cause I am yours just to be with you
Nobody near...

And it has begun to drag me so deep down
That I can't even remember where I was
And when I think of my days in the place I dwell
I see nothing but pain everyday
