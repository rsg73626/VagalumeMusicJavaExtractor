AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE

ELPHABA
Kiss Me too fiercely 
Hold me too tight
I meed help beliving
You're with me tonight
My wildest dreams
Could not forsee 
Lying beside you 
With you wanting me

And just for this moment
As long as you're mine
I've lot all resistance 
And crossed some boarderline
And if it turnes out
It's over too fast 
I'll make every last moment last
As long as you're mine

FIYERO
Maybe I'm brainless
Maybe I'm wise
But you've got me seeing 
Though different eyes
Somehow I've fallen 
Under your spell
And somehow I'm feeling
It's up that I fell

BOTH
Every moment 
As long as you're mine
I'll wake up my body
And make up for lost time

FIYERO
Say there's no future
For us as a pair

BOTH
And though I know I may know
I don't care
Just for this moment
As long as you're mine
Come be how you want to
And see how bright we shine
Borrow the moonlight
Until it is though
And know I'll be here holding you
As long as you're mine

FIYERO
(spoken)
What is it?

ELPHABA
(spoken)
It's just for the first time,
I feel ... wicked
