VAPTISMA TIS GNOSIS

Voice after voice joins this song, which is slowly escalating into an aural storm hovering barely within the limits of consciousness.
Thousands after thousands join the hymn, which people are only able to hear in their dreams.

If you listen to it very carefully, at the same time not listening to it at all, you can make sense of it.
You'll understand that it is an anthem.

It is a song for the nameless.
