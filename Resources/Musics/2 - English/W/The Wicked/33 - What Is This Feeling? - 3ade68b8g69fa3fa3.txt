WHAT IS THIS FEELING?

GALINDA
(spoken) Dearest darlingest Momsie and Popsical:

ELPHABA
(spoken) My dear Father:

BOTHThere's been some confusion
Over rooming here at Shiz:

ELPHABA
But of course, I'll care for Nessa:

GLINDA
But of course, I'll rise above it:

BOTH
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond
Yes, there's been some confusion
For you see, my room-mate is:

GALINDA
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe:

ELPHABA
Blonde.

GALINDA
What is this feeling?
So sudden and new?

ELPHABAI felt it the moment
I laid eyes on you:

GALINDA
My pulse is rushing:

ELPHABA
My head is reeling:

GALINDA
My face is flushing:

BOTH
What is this feeling?
Fervid as a flame,
Does it have a name?
Yes!:Loathing
Unadulterated loathing

GALINDA
For your face

ELPHABA
Your voice

GALINDA
Your clothing

BOTHLet's just say - I loathe it all
Ev'ry little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure and strong!
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing
Loathing you
My whole life long!

STUDENTS
Dear Galinda, you are just too good
How do you stand it? I don't think I could!
She's a terror! She's a Tartar!
We don't mean to show a bias,
But Galinda, you're a martyr!

GALINDA
Well: these things are sent to try us!

STUDENTS
Poor Galinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We all just want to tell you:
We're all on your side!
We share your:

GALINDA AND ELPHABA STUDENTS
What is this feeling Loathing
So sudden and new? Unadulterated loathing
I felt the moment For her face, her voice
I laid eyes on you Her clothing
My pulse is rushing Let's just say:
My head is reeling We loathe it all!
Oh, what is this feeling? Ev'ry little trait
Does it have a name? Makes our very flesh
Yes: Begin to crawl:.
