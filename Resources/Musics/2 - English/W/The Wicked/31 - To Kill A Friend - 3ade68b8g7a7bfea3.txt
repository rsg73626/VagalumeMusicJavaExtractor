TO KILL A FRIEND

Loyalty.
That's a funny thing.
Now how do you suppose I am to choose my followers?
Hmm?

Guess I'll start with my close friends.
Asking of their assistance in a dire task that will ultimately corrupt them.
That would be sufficient.

Then I'll proceed on to the misfits of the land.
To God's unwanted children.
Everybody wants power.
That's what really makes the world go around.
