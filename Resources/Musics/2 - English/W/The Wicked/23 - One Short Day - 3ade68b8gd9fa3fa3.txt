So I'll be back for good someday

To make my life and make my way
But for today, we'll wander and enjoy:

And we're warning the city
Now that we're in here
You'll know we've been here

ALL
Before we are done!

GLINDA
(spoken) Elphie - come on - we'll be late for Wizomania!

WIZOMANIA CHORUS
Who's the mage
Whose major itinerary
Is making all Oz merrier?
Who's the sage
Who's sagely sailed in to save our posteriors?
Whose enthuse for hot air ballooning
Has all of Oz honeymooning?
Woo - oo -oo 
Wizn't he wonderful?
(Our wonderful Wizard!)
