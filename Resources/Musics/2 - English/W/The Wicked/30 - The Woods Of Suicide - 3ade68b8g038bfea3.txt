THE WOODS OF SUICIDE

A purgatory of sorts.
Between life and death.
Between the beginning and the end.
Between light and darkness.

Only a select few may choose their destination.
...And they're headed for the end.

The dead smile at them on their way whispering them wonderful things.
Promises of sweet oblivion.
Pleading them to succumb to the dark.
Lasciate ogni speranga, voi chentrate.
