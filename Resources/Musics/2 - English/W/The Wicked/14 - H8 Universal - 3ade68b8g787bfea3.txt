H8 UNIVERSAL

Have you ever wished that people would just, you know, die?
I started disliking people at an early age.
I was never keen on company, so I mostly kept to myself.
I simply enjoyed solitude.

Eventually the dislike evolved into disgust.
And to hate.

Unexplainable, at times irrational, but honest hatred towards people.
After my transformation that hate escalated into a manical state of disgust towards every living creature.

I just wanted to kill a lot of people.
All of them, in fact.
