MAGNUM INNOMINANDUM

In a nameless place where none dare to venture, shapeless beings defying the very laws of nature awant, far away, yet so near, they observe patiently.
Only the most potent ones are even aware of their existence.

And as the time is soon at hand they will come as one.
Come with the storm, bringing forth the prosphetic ending.

Come! we must hurry before the storm awakens!
