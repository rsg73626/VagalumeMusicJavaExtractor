SOMETHING BAD

DOCTOR DILLAMOND
(spoken) Oh, Miss Elphaba - The things one hears these

(sung) I've heard of an OxA professor from Quox
No longer permitted to teach
Who has lost all powers of speech
And an Owl in Munchkin Rock
A vicar with a thriving flock
Forbidden to preach
Now he can only screech!
Only rumors - but still - 
Enough to give pause
To anyone with paws
Something bad is happening in Oz:

ELPHABA
Something bad? Happening in Oz?

DILLAMOND

Something baaaaaaad:
(spoken) Sorry: "Bad":

ELPHABA(spoken) Doctor Dillamond - If something bad is happening
to the Animals, someone's got to tell the Wizard.
That's why we have a Wizard.
(sung) So nothing bad:.

DILLAMOND
(spoken) I hope you're right:

BOTHNothing all that bad:

DILLAMOND
Nothing truly baaaaaad:.
(spoken) Sorry: "Bad":

ELPHABA

In Oz:
