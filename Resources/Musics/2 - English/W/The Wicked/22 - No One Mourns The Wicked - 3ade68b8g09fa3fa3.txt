NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED

CITIZENS OF OZ: 
Good news! She's dead!
The Witch of the West is dead!
The wickedest witch there ever was
The enemy of all of us here in Oz
Is Dead!
Good news!
Good news!

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD:
(spoken) Look! It's Glinda!

GLINDA
(spoken) Fellow Ozians:
(sung) Let us be glad
Let us be grateful
Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue
The wicked workings of you-know-who
Isn't it nice to know
That good will conquer evil?
The truth we all believe'll by and by
Outlive a lie
For you and - 

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD:
No one mourns the Wicked

ANOTHER PERSON:
No one cries "They won't return!"

ALLNo one lays a lily on their grave

MAN
The good man scorns the Wicked!

WOMEN
Through their lives, our children learn

ALL
What we miss, when we misbehave:

GLINDA
And Goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone
It just shows when you're Wicked
You're left only
On your own

ALL
Yes, Goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked cry alone
Nothing grows for the Wicked
They reap only 
What they've sown

GLINDA(spoken) Are people born Wicked? Or do they have
Wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had 
a father. She had a mother, as so many do:

FATHER
How I hate to go and leave you lonely

MOTHER
That's alright - it's only just one night

FATHERBut know that you're here in my heart
While I'm out of your sight

GLINDA
(spoken)
And like every family - they had their secrets

LOVER
Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty
I've got one more night left, here in town
So have another drink of green elixir
And we'll have ourselves a little mixer
Have another swallow, little lady,
And follow me down:

GLINDA
(spoken) And of course, from the moment she was born,
she was - well - different

MIDWIFEIt's coming

FATHERNow?

MIDWIFE
The baby's coming

FATHER
And how!

MIDWIFE AND FATHER
I see a nose
I see a curl
It's a healthy, perfect,
Lovely, little - 

FATHER
(spoken) Sweet Oz!

MOTHER
(spoken) What is it? : what's wrong?

MIDWIFEHow can it be?

FATHER
What does it mean?

MIDWIFE
It's atrocious

FATHERIt's obscene!

MIDWIFE AND FATHER
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage
The baby is unnaturally

ALL
Green!

FATHER
(spoken) Take it away: take it away!

GLINDA
(spoken) So you see - it couldn't have been easy!
ALL
No one mourns the Wicked!
Now at last, she's dead and gone!
Now at last, there's joy throughout the land
And Goodness knows
We know what Goodness is
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone

GLINDA
She died alone:

ALLWoe to those 
Who spurn what Goodness
They are shown
No one mourns the Wicked

GLINDA
Good news!
CROWD
No one mourns the Wicked!

GLINDAGood news!

ALL
No one mourns the Wicked!
Wicked!
Wicked!
