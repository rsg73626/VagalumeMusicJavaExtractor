ELSEWHEN (THE FINAL UNMAKING)

At the end of time they meet for a final confrontation.
With the storm comes the beast.
At the end of time they meet for a final showdown.
Powermongers fearless and ruthless.

Against one another, poised to kill.
Horrors never before seen.
Beings as in a dream.
Guardians of the end.
As one being they stand.
Seeing everything, reaching everywhere.
Cleansing the filthy flesh away.

The beast of forbiden lore shall be defeated nevermore.

You are weak, sentient meat.
In the end we must live

At the end of time they meet for a final showdown.
Crumbling down comes the pillars of time.
One after another they shall fall.
