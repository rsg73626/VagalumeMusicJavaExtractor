DEAR OLD SHIZ

PERSON IN CROWD
(spoken) Glinda! Is it true - were you her friend?!

GLINDA
(spoken) Well - it depends on what you mean by "friend." I did
know her. That is, our paths did cross. At school:

STUDENTS
O hallowed halls and vine-draped walls
The proudliest sight there is
When grey and sere our hair hath turned
We shall still revere the lessons learned 
In our days at dear old Shiz
Our days at dear old

GALINDA
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ol:

STUDENTS AND GALINDA
Dear old Shiz-zzzz
