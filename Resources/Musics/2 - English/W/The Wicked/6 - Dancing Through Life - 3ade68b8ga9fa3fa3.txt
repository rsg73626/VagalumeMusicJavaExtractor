DANCING THROUGH LIFE

FIYERO
The trouble with school is
They always try to teach the wrong lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out
Of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow
Less shallow
But I say: why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live "the unexamined life":

Dancing through life
Skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless
For the brainless
Why think too hard?
When it's so soothing
Dancing through life
No need to tough it
When you can sluff it off as I do
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life
So keep dancing through

Dancing through life
Swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught-less
When you're thoughtless
Those who don't try
Never look foolish
Dancing through life
Mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less
Trouble is rife
Woes are fleeting
Blows are glancing
When you're dancing
Through life:
(spoken) So - what's the most swankified place in town?

GALINDA 
(spoken) That would be the Ozdust Ballroom.

FIYERO
(spoken) Sounds perfect.
(sung) Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet there later tonight
We can dance till it's light
Find the prettiest girl:
Give 'er a whirl:
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on - follow me
You'll be happy to be there:

ALL
Dancing through life
Down at the Ozdust

FIYERO
If only because dust
Is what we come to:

ALL
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life

FIYERO
So keep dancing through:

BOQ
(spoken) Miss Galinda - I hope you'll save at least one
dance for me. I'll be right there. Waiting. Allnight.

GALINDA(spoken) Oh - that's so kind. But you know what would
be even kinder?
(sung) See that tragic'ly beautiful girl
The one in the chair
It seems so unfair
We should go on a spree
And not she
Gee - 
I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were to go invite her:

BOQ
(spoken) Well, maybe - I could invite her!

GALINDAOh, Bick, really?
You would do that for me?

BOQ
(spoken) I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda:

GALINDA
(spoken) So:

FIYERO
(spoken) So I'll be picking you up around eight?

GALINDA(spoken) After all -
(sung) Now that we've met one another

FIYERO AND GALINDA
It's clear - we deserve each other

GALINDAYou're perfect:

FIYERO
You're perfect:

BOTH
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever
Dancing through life:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) Oh, Elphaba - isn't it wonderful?
(sung) Fin'lly, for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this Munchkin boy
Galinda found for me 
And I only wish there were 
Something I could do for her
To repay her
Elphaba, see?
We deserve each other
And Galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other,
Me and Boq:
(spoken) Elphaba, please try to understand:

ELPHABA
I do:
(spoken) Galinda - my sister and I were talking about you
just now-

GALINDA
(spoken) And I was just talking about you! I thought you
might want to wear this hat to the party tonight!
(sung) It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know - black is this year's pink
You deserve each other
This hat and you
You're both so smart
You deserve each other
So here, out of the goodness of my heart:

BOQ
(spoken) Listen: Nessa:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) Yes?

BOQ
Uh - Nessa
I've got something to confess, a
Reason why, well - 
Why I asked you here tonight
Now I know it isn't fair:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) Oh, Boq, I know why.

BOQ
(spoken) You do?

NESSAROSE
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well - isn't that right?

BOQ
(spoken) No! No! It's because: because:
(sung) Because you are so beautiful!

NESSAROSE
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful!
And we deserve each other
Don't you see, this is our chance?
We deserve each other
Don't we, Boq?

BOQ
(spoken) You know what?
(sung) Let's dance:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) What?!

BOQ
Let's dance!

ALL
Dancing through life
Down at the Ozdust
If only because dust
Is what we come to!
And the strange thing:
Your life could end up changing
While you're dancing
Through!
