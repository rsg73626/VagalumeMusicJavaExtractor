A SENTIMENTAL MAN

WIZARD
I am a sentimental man
Who always longed to be a father
That's why I do the best I can
To treat each citizen of Oz as a son - 
Or daughter
So Elphaba, I'd like to raise you high
'Cuz I think everyone deserves
The chance to fly
And helping you with your ascent al-
Lows me to feel so parental
For I am a sentimental man
