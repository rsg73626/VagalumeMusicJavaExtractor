MARCH OF THE WITCH HUNTERS

OZIANS
Go and hunt her
And find her 
And kill her

VICIOUS WOMAN
(spoken) Good fortune, Witch Hunters!

OZIANS
Go and hunt her
And find her
And kill her

RABID MAN
(spoken) Kill the Witch!

OZIANS
Wickedness must be punished
Evil effectively eliminated
Wickedness must be punished
Kill the Witch!

TINMAN
(spoken) And this is more than just a service to the Wizard.
I have a personal score to settle with Elph-with
The Witch!

(sung) It's due to her I'm made of tin
Her spell made this occur
So for once I'm glad I'm heartless
I'll be heartless killing her!

And the lion also
Has a grievance to repay
If she'd let him fight his own battles
When he was young
He wouldn't be a coward today!

CROWD
Kill her! Kill the witch!

ALL
Wickedness must be punished
Brave Witch-Hunters, I would join you if I could
Because Wickedness must be punished
Punished
Punished
But good!
