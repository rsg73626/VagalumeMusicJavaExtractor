ISLANDS

When I cant see
their secret island
Stranded in your own heart
I felt all its seasons
I feel I have to belong

I can listen to all your emotions
I can touch on your fears
please take me to the path
but I can see

When I cant see
their secret island
Stranded in your own heart
I felt all its seasons
I feel I have to belong

Your breath is my windows
where I feel like flying
his soul reigns the my God
I'm in the tide

I can see the lady, opening up your mind
be a lesson, Secret side

I see islands in your mouth
have someone on the ground

I live on islands
