BORN OF THE SEA

I start like a wave
moving and singing
the size of a cave
the truth never seems

I drown in my love
their harpoons not hurt me
I am my own crown
go to crawling

reflects on the waves
shining and breathing
I drown in your face
deep and deepert

I drown in my love
their harpoons not hurt me
I am my own crown
go to crawling

I'm ready (to cross the ocean)

for one day
I wait your ok
I live in a jar
I see all the stars
I drink you
I leave you

when I enter the your brain
inside your head again
I live in the jar
