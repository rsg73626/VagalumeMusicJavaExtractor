NOTHING NEW

I’m going to dress up tonight
And I’ll look real pretty for I don’t know who
I’ll find my own way around this great big city
And I’m gonna sit at a bar and I’ll have a drink

I’ll leave you to revel in your youthful yearnings
I know you like to visit them from time to time
And like a thief I steal the words you write to her
I take them to my heart and I wish them to be mine

But this is nothing new
But it ain’t nothing
Well this is nothing new
But it ain’t nothing

You long for sweetness
Does mine make you sickly
Or maybe I no longer have the sweetness you require
There’s nothing sweet about a heart so embittered
It’s ugly and it’s cold and tonight it’s out for hire

But it ain’t nothing new
But this ain’t nothing
Well this is nothing new
But it ain’t nothing

We live through this day after day
And complacency’s a curse
But you just can’t escape it
And I’ve arrived at that place where my tolerance gave way
And I struggle to hold my head up high

But it ain’t nothing new
Well this is nothing new
But it ain’t nothing
