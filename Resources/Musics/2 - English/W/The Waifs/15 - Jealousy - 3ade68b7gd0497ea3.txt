JEALOUSY

Now’s the time you’re leaving you got to do what you got to do
When you come in from the cold I’ll still be warm for you
And I won’t be bending backwards like you never done for me
When you look at what’s left inside
You’ve only got your jealousy

It’s wearing me thin, all this trying to please
I’m looking within and I can see for miles
And I’m trying to grin as I’m trying to please
I keep looking within, you know I can still see for miles

Like a player in a show you never gonna wait around for what remains
If you go and play your games of jealousy
I don’t want to deal with that again
It’s your jealousy baby
You got to lose it
