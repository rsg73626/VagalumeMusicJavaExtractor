I BELIEVE

Seems like only yesterday I thought I had my life together
Ain’t it funny how some things change
For it is today I feel uncertain about my whole world
All once familiar is now strange
I’ve become so dependant on those things that I once rejected
I’m rejecting all I believed
I’m so open minded that it leaves me undecided
Now I’m forever caught between two extremes
I believe

I found some time to get away on my own
I came to a place where nobody knows my name
With the hope it would help me see things clearer
It has for now I realise that it was nothing but a planned escape
I believe
