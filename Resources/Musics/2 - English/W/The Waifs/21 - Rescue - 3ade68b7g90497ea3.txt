RESCUE

When your boots are well worn in
And you’re tired of travelling
When you got nowhere to call your own
You know my place can be your home

To the rescue here I come
To the rescue here I come

When I was out there playing hard
With my big attitude and my broken heart
Poison my only friend
And my drinking addiction

To the rescue there you were
To my rescue there you were

Now we’re both out there floating around
I still got to space but you’re on the ground
You’re in my heart you’re in my head
Right now we don’t need no rescuing

To the rescue I’ll never let you fall
To my rescue you’ve been on call
