WHEN I DIE

When I die wont you bury me
In the town where I was born
Most of my life Ive been rambiling free
When I die I want to come back home

Ever since I was a baby child
I knew I was born to roam
I had to climb to the top of the hill
Just to see what lies beyond
Now seasons change and I am still the same
I dont belong to anyone
Still a piece of me will always be
Sitting in my hometown sun

In my time I have seen ten thousand setting suns
And I made my bed where I lay my head
And it never hurt anyone
It could be said that a girl like me
Aint nothing but a prodigal son
And just like that prodigal boy Im gonna finish off where I've begun
