SERVICE FEE

You broke down my door and let yourself in
Helped yourself to my soul and skin
You ate all you needed and then had the nerve
To thank me for dinner and help yourself tp dessert
You helped yourself
I couldve chaged you a service fee
For all you did to me
I shouldve chged you a service fee
For all you did to me
You helped yourself

It wasnt very pretty, it wasnt very kid
But I rathr go deaf, paralysed or blind
But I lay back, held still by the fear
That you would smash me to pieces
And Id die here

I carry knifes in my pockets, bullets in my guns
Dont try to chase me Im not going to run
And dont ever ask me, dont you dare begin
Im not going to talk about it but god knows
Im going to sing
God knows I am going to sing about it

No thankyou boy Id rather walk home alone
No thank you sir Id rather walk home alone
No thank you brother Id rather walk home alone
No thankyou mister Id rather walk home alone
