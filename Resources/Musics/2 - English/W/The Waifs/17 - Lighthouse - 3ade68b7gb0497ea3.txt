LIGHTHOUSE

Lighthouse tall and grand
Standing on that cold headland
Shine your light across the sea
For a wayward sailor girl like me

Lighthouse man
Guide this sailor back to land
Steer my ship on through the storm
Back to water safe and calm

Sometimes I need a lighthouse for my own
It gets so dark I can’t see which way I’m going
Oh lighthouse man I’m all at sea
Shine a little lighthouse light on me
Lighthouse man I’m all at sea
Shine a little lighthouse light on me

Lighthouse man can’t help us all
Some he’ll save and some will fall
He’ll show you where the danger lies
But he can’t help it if you capsize
He’ll light your way but that is all
Steer your own ship back to shore

Won’t you light my lonely way back home
This sea is full of misery and woe
Oh woe betide those that say
They don’t need no light to light their way
They think they’re safe enough on their own
Drown in murky depths below

We all need a lighthouse for our own
It gets so dark I can’t see which way I’m going
Oh lighthouse man I’m all at sea
Shine a little lighthouse light on me
