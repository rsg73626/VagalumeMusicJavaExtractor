HIGHWAY ONE

Highway 1, 12 hour drive
I got a place I do call mine
I got me a space where I can breathe
I got my garden I got my trees

And if you’re ever out this way
And if you still recall my name
You know I’m not that hard to find
I live on Highway 1, 12 hour drive

And we’re gonna be
Eating fish from a coal fire
And we’re gonna be
Sleepin outside
Till the fires coal
Or till it gets too cold

But if you come through late at night
I’ll leave on my bedside light
I’m down the hall and to the right
Baby you can creep in and wake me up

And we’re gonna be
Eating fish from a coal fire
And we’re gonna be
Sleepin outside
Till the fires coal
Or till it gets too cold

You know it’s doubtful I will tell
Where my love and I do lay
Or where my flowers grow
Highway 1, 12 hour drive
Highway 1, 12 hour drive
Highway 1, 12 hour drive
I live on Highway 1, 12 hour drive
