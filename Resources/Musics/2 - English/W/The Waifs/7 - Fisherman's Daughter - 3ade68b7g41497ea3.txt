FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER

I don’t like gold and I don’t like pearls
I’m just your regular West Australian fisherman’s daughter
I’m a middle class folk singing guitar playin’ girl

I ain’t seen the world no I’ve not travelled far
I’m saving dollars for a 1962 ruby red interior
R series Valiant, mother of a car

I’m a country girl in a city whirlpool
I’m pulling over man I’m gonna let you through
I’m living in the left hand lane of my city
Slow down so I can walk this highway with you
Slow down let me walk it with you

Slow down, we all gotta slow
I wanna walk the highway with you, you and you and you

No I’m not yet married I got no ring on my hand
I got my heart beating for this sweet loving
Second hand dealing boy
I’m gonna love him the best way I can
I know I can

I’m a country girl in a city whirlpool
I’m pulling over man I’m gonna let you through
I’m living in the left hand lane of my city
Slow down so I can walk this highway with you
Slow down let me walk it with you

I don’t like gold and I don’t like pearls
I’m just your regular West Australian fisherman’s daughter
I’m a middle class folk singing guitar playin’ girl
