SHELTER ME

I decided no one's knowing
anything about where I'm going
I can't even talk to my friends
anymore
Not blaming anyone for the mess I've gotten in
I'm only frightened by the things that I've done

Keep me safe from myself
I can't do it without your help
Your love's the finest thing that I've ever known
I want to come home

Thinking back when I was young
and you kept me safe from everything
set me straight when I went wrong
raised me to respect myself
I can offer no excuse for this senseless self abuse
and all the pain that I've cause you to feel
When I hurt myself it hurts you more
and that's what hurts me most of all
We shouldn't go on hurting anymore

keep me safe from myself
I can't do it without your help
your love's the finest thing I've ever known
I want to come home

Oh I want to come home X 4

Keep me safe from myself
I can't do it without your help
your love's the finest thing I've ever known

So take me now and shelter me
for there's nothing left of me
