THE HAIRCUT

This is more than a haircut I'm wearing on my head
I thought I'd dye it red but got it cut instead
And maybe I could send you my long blond locks
Cause you were always after something baby
something Im not

See Im darker underneath, I'm darker by far
Im dark as hell you know who you are

My eyes, I always, I wished they where green
My skin is so damn brown but the sun, it dont see
And fingernails I couldve stuck them on
The hair on my lip I shouldve waxed it off

Yeah I know my lips could do with a little more pout
The mole on my chin I can do with out
And my cheekbones, they never sat real high
Ill get some bone put in, they can take it from
My thighs

Im darker underneath, I'm darker by far
Im as dark as hell - you know who you are

So now when I make love I make love to myself
I got no disease so it's good for my health
I got my hands in my pants down my calvin kleins
I dont need you no more baby, I can come every time

Im darker underneath, I'm darker by far
Im as dark as hell you know who you are

Dont you ever show your face here again
To me or any of my friends
'Cause Im glad I found out what you're all about
When I finally fell down off my cloud

Cause baby when you ran away
You broke my heart
You kept my Kerouac books and that old guitar
And I am darker underneath, Im darker by far
Im as dark as all hell, you know what you are
I don't need to tell you, you know what you are
I don't need to tell you, you know what you are
I don't need to tell you - I don't need to tell you, no
You know what you are

This is more than a haircut I'm wearing on my head
I thought I'd dye it red but got it
