CRAZY TRAIN

Crazy train, rolling down that crazy track
Crazy train, rolling down that crazy track
Going to New Orleans and I ain’t coming back

Crazy train, where do you think I’m bound
Crazy train, where do you think I’m bound
Bound for New Orleans
Gonna play the blues in that blues town

Crazy train, steaming through that crazy night
Crazy train, steaming through that crazy line
Got on this morn’ and I’ll be there in the morning light
