WILLOW TREE

Under the willow tree, that's where I wait for you 
to come back to me, but you're so far away. 
I just sit by here in the morning sun, 
and I wait under the willow tree. 

It was a bitter seed that you left that day 
when you walked out my door screaming "Get out of my face!" 
I took all your hurtin' words, I took your bad deeds 
and I buried 'em deep underneath that tree. 

Under the willow tree, that's where I wait for you 
to come back to me, but you're so far away. 
I just sit by here in the morning sun, 
and I wait under the willow tree.

But such beauty grew from bitterness. 
Oh how it's helped to heal this heavy heart, 
oh and I want you to know, yeah that it's ok. 
If you come back I would welcome you like it was yesterday. 

Under the willow tree, that's where I wait for you 
to come back to me, but you're so far away. 
I just sit by here in the morning sun, 
and I wait under the willow tree. 

--- 

Oh, but I'm not asking you for union, no-no. 
I want your promise to be true oh, 
'Cos I've been around the world, honey I've seen enough to know - 
there aint nobody else. I'd rather walk with you. 

Under the willow tree, that's where I wait for you 
to come back to me, but you're so far away. 
I just sit right here and I play my guitar, 
and I wait under the willow tree. 

Under the willow tree.
