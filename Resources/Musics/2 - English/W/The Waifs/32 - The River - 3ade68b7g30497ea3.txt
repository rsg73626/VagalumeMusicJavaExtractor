THE RIVER

I stood and watched my daddy die
no one could help his plate
he was trying to save our home
on the day that the river rose

well it came alive I heard them say
there was nothing we could do as he washed away

running from the heart of it
right into the cause of it X 2

I'm mad now, but I'm only seven
well it's been hard since papa went to heaven
but staying now, my mama said
he worked this land, and his life it's here

running from the heart of it
right into the cause of it X 3

Yeah everyone you follow me late at night
we'll go down to the river where the moon is bright
and we can wash our sorrow down
underneath that shining ground

and we'll be sitting in the sunlight laughing
can't you feel daddy there
there's life and death and all this power
underneath these shining stars

running from the heart of it
right into the cause of it X 3
