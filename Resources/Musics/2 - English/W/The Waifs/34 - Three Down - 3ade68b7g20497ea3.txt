THREE DOWN

Three months on the road
But I’ve still got four more to go

There’s a full moon and it’s rising over Austin
I can see a big old Texas flag flying in the wind
I can’t sleep for all the bright lights of this cheap hotel
This is some kind of hellhole I’m living in
Three months on the road
But I’ve still got four more to go
Then I’m going home

I got my sister crying at me
“C’mon lets go downtown
You spend all day in this hotel room just lazing around”
So she takes me to a bar down on 6th street
And she orders me to drink them down
I got three under my belt
Just four more to go
Then I’m going home

(Take me home!)

Well we were driving out of Nashville and the clock it said 12am
We’ve got a give hour drive to Jackson
And no map to get us there
We get lost somewhere off the parkway
We have to stop and ask some guy who look like he don’t care
I said we’ve been three hours on the road
He said you’ve got four more to go
Till’ you’ll be home

Three under my belt
But I’ve still got four more to go
Then I’m going home

Well I’ve been three months on the road
But I’ve still got four more to go
