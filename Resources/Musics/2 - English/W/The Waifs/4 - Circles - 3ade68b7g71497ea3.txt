CIRCLES

What’s your excuse for living like
You’re somebody different
You’re nobody different
You’re just somebody

Tell me what’s the reason behind
All your frustrations
It’s a bad situation
Can you trust me

Do you think that maybe you live your
Life in circles
Going round in circles
Heading nowhere

If you wanna sort it out you gotta
Talk about it, live without it
Come on and talk about it, live without it

What’s your excuse for living like
You’re somebody different
You’re nobody different
You’re just somebody
