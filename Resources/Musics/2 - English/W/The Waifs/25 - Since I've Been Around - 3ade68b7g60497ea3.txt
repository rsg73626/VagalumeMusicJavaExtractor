SINCE I'VE BEEN AROUND

Walking down the main street of the town where I was born
Looking at these things I’ve seen so many times before
I take a deep breath, smile and kick a stone along the ground
Been so long, since I’ve been around

There’s comfort in the way that everything still looks the same
People that I bump into; they call me by my name
It almost feels as though I never even left this town
Been so long, since I’ve been around

My girlfriend lived on Hawdon Street – man was she a sight
Sometimes I would sneak into her bedroom late at night
Now she’s not there – I’m told her family long since left the town
Been so long, since I’ve been around

Yeah many of my friends found some other place they’d rather be
But I still know of one good mate, she gonna keep me company
I think I’ll gonna call her up, we’ll go and paint the town
Been so long, since I’ve been around

I stopped on by her place, years ago I knew her well
‘Let’s go drink to old times at the Adelaide Hotel’
She said it’s twenty years now since they shut that old pub down
Been so long, since I’ve been around

Yeah but the hospital’s still standing, down over by the river shore
That’s the place where I took my first breath, so many years before
I take a deep breath now and feel my chest begin to pound
Been so long, since I’ve been around

Now I’m lying by the river feeling lazy in the shade
Children shout and splash about in water where I played
And I’m thinking I could stay a while, maybe settle down
Been so long, since I’ve been around
