COMPANY

Well my head
Looks to the sky
Will this pain ever end?
You know i'm lonely,
I want some understanding
Someone to talk to
Someone to be there and hold me, yeah
I'm feeling down
Running around
Inside myself
And its confusing me

I just need company
I can't stand it here by myself
I just need company

Here i go again
Oh i'm breaking down
Lord how i try, im trying so hard
To get my feet on the ground
I wanna keep em there
I wanna keep em there
But something's changed in me

I just need a little company
I can't stand it here by myself
I just need company
'do do do's

When you're not here
I can't see the road ahead
When you're not here
Something deep in me is dead x 4

I just need a little company
I can't stand it here by myself
I just need a company
I can't stand it here by myself x 3
