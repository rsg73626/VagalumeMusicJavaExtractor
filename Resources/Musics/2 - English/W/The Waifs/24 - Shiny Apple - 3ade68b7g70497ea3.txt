SHINY APPLE

Shiny apple rotten on the inside
Skin is smooth but you soul is soft
Oh you look so appetising but
Taste the truth it’ll make you spit

And how long have I known you now
But I knew after just one taste
And how long has my mouth been sour
It’s been sour ever since that day

And how long can I go on like this
Knowing what I know anyway
But it makes me feel helpless to
Stand and watch while you rot away
