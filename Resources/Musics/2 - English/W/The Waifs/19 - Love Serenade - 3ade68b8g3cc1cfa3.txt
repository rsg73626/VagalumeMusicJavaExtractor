LOVE SERENADE

When the night-time comes you can hear
My heart calling
Calling out to you my one true love
Thinking about you all of the while
Thinking about you its making me smile
Honey Im sitting on top of the world just
Thinking about you

In the morring light thats when Im feeling right
Another day come, another day go, another day closer till I make you my own
Honey Im siting on top of the world
Just thinking about you 

I wouldnt say it if it wasnt true
Honey Im in love with you
Im going to show you what I can do

Comeover here youve gotta be told,
My love for you is out of control
Honey I am sitting on top of the world,
Just thinking about you girl
Im going to show you how much I care,
Marry you and take you away some where
Sit back in a rocking chair and rock all day with you my dear

Cause I love you, I love you I love you I love you

In the morrin, in
