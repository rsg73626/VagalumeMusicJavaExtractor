LIES

(Hey mama hey mama hey ma they lie) x 3

You read the paper, watch the news
and you think you're well informed
Well I got some news for you my friend

That headline that you read
the story that broke
it was a scandal - yeah a scam
political masterstroke
Tell you what they you want you to hear
close your eyes and open your ears

(It's easy), yes it's easier that way
(cause you don't) cause you don't have to think for yourself
You said hey I tell no lies, I tell no lies
Because I read it all in black and white
It was on my TV yeah they were telling me just what to believe
Yeah I tell no lies, I tell no lies
And all the while they're tellin' you lies
(hey mama hey, mey ma they lie) x 10

Everyday you and me, we see what we are shown
yes it can be hard to scratch below
there are people at the top, they are hidden far from view
they're not gonna show their faces to the likes of me and you
you never see them on the street,
but you'll always see the things that they do.

(yes they know) yes they can get away
(no price) no price is too high for them to pay

Yeah I tell no lies, I tell no lies it's very simple, yeah it's in black and white and it's on your TV oh we got everything you need to believe
Hey I tell no lies, I tell no lies, I know why they're telling lies
why they're telling you lies
And all the while they're tellin' you lies

Oh Lies lies lies (lies lies lies) x3
(Hey mama hey mama hey ma they lie) x 8
And all the while they're tellin' you lies.
