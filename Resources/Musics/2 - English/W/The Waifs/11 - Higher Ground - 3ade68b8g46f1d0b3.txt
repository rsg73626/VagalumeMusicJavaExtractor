HIGHER GROUND

Bitter in the belly, sweet on the tongue
Pick up the pieces gonna tell someone
Wind blows gentle and the wind blows warm
Carry me on to the eye of the storm
Water is rising it's an awful sound
Carry my feet to the higher ground

I don't know but I been told
It takes a whole lotta diggin for an ounce of gold
Ounce of gold don't buy no bread
Everybody sleeping in a strangers bed
Water is rising it's an awful sound
Carry my feet to the higher ground

Foot on the sea, foot on the land
Loud as a lion with a book in your hand
I ain't singing in the lukewarm choir
Standing on the world with your legs on fire
Time no more it's an awful sound
Carry my feet to the higher ground
