BRIDAL TRAIN

Telegram arrived today
It's time to catch the Monterey
Cause the man I wed he waits for me
And the daughter that he's yet to see

U.S. navy beamed its message
will deliver brides on a one way passage
it made big news across the nation
the bridal train leaves from Perth station

All the girls around Australia
married to a yankee sailor
your fare is paid across the sea
to the home of the brave and the land of the free

from west to east the young girls came
all aboard the bridal train
It was a farewell crossing of her land
she's gone to meet her sailor man

no time for sad goodbyes
she held her mother as she cried
and then waited there in the freo rain
to climb aboard the bridal train

well she was holding her future in her hand
the faded photo of a man
catch a sailor if you can
the war bride leaves her southern land

All the girls around Australia
married to a yankee sailor
your fare is paid across the sea
to the home of the brave and the land of the free

from west to east the young girls came
all aboard the bridal train
it was a farewell crossing of her land
she's gone to meet her sailor man

this is the story of the starry nights
through desert plains and city lights
through burning sun and driving rain
she wept aboard the bridal train

All the girls around Australia
married to a yankee sailor
your fare is paid across the sea
to the home of the brave and the land of the free

from west to east the young girls came
all aboard the bridal train
it was a farewell crossing over land
she's gone to meet her sailor man
