TAKE IT IN

Now she’s thinking of the red soil and the mango trees
In her mind she’s still splashing round down on Cable Beach
And her eyes, they are as rich and faraway as the sunset there
She’s not taking in a word I say
Well I might as well be talking to myself

Take it in, take it all in
Now is a time that will not come again
Take it in, take it all in
This is a day and It's here for the living

So we step outside into this Melbourne weather
With a shock it brings her back to where she is
well we’ve made this place our home
Surrounded by unknown
We’re gonna stick it out until it comes together

Take it in, take it all in
Now is a time that will not come again
Take it in, take it all in
This is a day and it’s here for the living

We’re only living for a day to come on, some days gone by
Never taking in each moment
Never knowing what you had until it passed you by
And it’ll pass you by

Take it in, take it all in
Now is a time that will not come again
Take it in, take it all in
This is the day and it’s here for the living

Take it all in
Now is a time that will not come again
Take it in, take it all in
This is the day and it’s here for the living
