SWEETNESS

There’s nothing like a big old lie
A good record and a smoke to pass time by
Music gets me in the mood
It all kicks in and I sit back
And think about you

Sweetness to me
That’s all you’ll ever be
You mean stuff to me

I like the way you’re wearing your smile
And you close your eyes
And you leave us for a while
But leaving’s all I ever do
I got a good pair of boots
And my guitar plays sweet tunes

Sweetness to me
That’s all you’ll ever be
You mean stuff to me

Sing me a song before I go
The tour’s on the road and I won’t be home
For three months or maybe more
Rent my room out when I’m gone
I’ll call and let you know when I’ll be home
And where I’m flying in from

Sweetness to me
That’s all you’ll ever be
You mean stuff to me

Sweetness to me
It’s all you’re ever gonna be
You mean stuff to me
