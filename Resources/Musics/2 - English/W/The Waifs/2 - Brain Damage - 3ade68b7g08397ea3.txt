BRAIN DAMAGE

I’m going out to damage my brain
You won’t come; you say you’re staying at home
It’s no shame; night and day we see each other anyway
We’ve got to move, we’ve got to get away
It’s a long cold night but there’s a better day
Wouldn’t you say, correct me if I’m wrong
But we’ve got all the good reasons for time on our own

You see me all the time
You see me all the time
You see me all the time
Hey babe throw me some line

It’s him and her; it’s this and that
I feel my tyres going flat
There’s no get up and go for getting it on
We got all the good reasons for time on our own

You see me all the time
You see me all the time
You see me all the time
Hey babe throw me some line x2
