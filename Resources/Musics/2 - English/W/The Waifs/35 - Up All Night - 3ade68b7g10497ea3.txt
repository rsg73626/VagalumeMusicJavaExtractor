UP ALL NIGHT

Watched the sun sinking low
Watched the moon rising slow
Watched it move across the sky
Till I saw the morning light

Up all night
Up all night
Things just don’t seem right
Lordy I think I might
Stay up all night

We were young long ago
Now there’s ash where the fire glowed
Cold and grey, black as night
I’m waiting for the morning light

Up all night
Up all night
Things just don’t seem right
Lordy I think I might
Stay up all night

Watched the sun sinking low
I watched the moon rising slow
Watched it move across the sky
Till I saw the morning light

Up all night
Up all night
Things just don’t seem right
Lordy I think I might
Stay up all night

Stay up all night
