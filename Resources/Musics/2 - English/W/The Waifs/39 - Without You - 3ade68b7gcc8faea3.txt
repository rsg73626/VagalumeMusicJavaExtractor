WITHOUT YOU

Ive been looking out for number one
Ive been stepping out with my friends
I dont have to justify what I have done
I dont have to answer to anyone

I put my body on the line
Take a step out of my mind
Life takes on a different veiw without you

I feel energized like I was young
I have not felt this way since we began
I re-evaluate my future plan
Time to free myself from your command

Theres no need to compromise
Ill do what ever I decide
no one else to spoil the view - without you

I dont care if I ever touch the sun
I dont care if the whole thing comes undone
Everyday to me is a surprise
I dont care if it leads to my demise

No restrictions now Im free
No black clouds hanging over me
I think I like this view without you
