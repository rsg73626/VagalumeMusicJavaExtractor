FALLOUT

That stuff thatÂ’s falling from the sky really isn't rain
I'd put on a hat but its eating out my brain
It's really all too late if only to explain

We messed with mother nature
And now she's had enough
Check mate is her final move
There's no such call of bluff
Not too long you'll really start to feel

It's already there but you just can't see it
It's up there in the air, how's it feel to breathe it
No matter what we do regardless of the tears

Fall-la-la-la-la-la

That stuff that's falling from the sky really isn't rain
I'd put on a hat but its eating out my brain
It's really all too late if only to explain
Silence not a warning but its really all in vain

We messed with mother nature
And now she's had enough
Check mate is her final move
There's no such call of bluff
Not before too long you'll really start to feel
Something's really wrong as your skin will start to peel
