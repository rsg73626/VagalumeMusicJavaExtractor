TEENAGE

Teenage

I want a car
I want a girl

Teenage
Teenage
Don't want to work
Don't want to go to school

Teenage
Teenage
Leave me alone
I don't care about you
I don't care about you

'Cause I'm teenage
And I'm young
Ha ha and I'm strong
And I'm wild
And I'm teenage

Teenage
Teenage
I want a car
I want a girl, yeah!

Leave me alone
I don't care about you
I don't care about you

'Cause I'm teenage
And I'm young
Ha ha and I'm strong
And I'm wild
And I'm teenage
