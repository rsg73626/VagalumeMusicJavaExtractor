MESSAGE FROM THE UNDERWORLD

Attention all you humans
Who feel the overload
A message from the underworld
We finally broke the code
There is no god in heaven
There is no answer fit
Just a phantom overlord
Who says that this is it
I said, "uh, yeah"
Can ya feel the chords we play?
Can ya hear the words we say?
Can ya feel the chords we play?
Can ya hear the words we say?
There is no need to pray
Repentance is in vain
The message from the underworld
Says we're all insane
There is no wrong or right
There is no Pentecost
There is no guiding light
No answer for the lost
I said, "uh, yeah"
Can ya feel the chords we play?
Can ya hear the words we say?
Can ya feel the chords we play?
Can ya hear the words we say?
