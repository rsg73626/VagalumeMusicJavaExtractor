THE HIDEOUT

Love me my love
Come with me now
Come here my love
On the ride

We'll ride the night
By the sparkling light
Of the bright diamond sky
On the range

Every little thing that I have seen
Comes back to remind me in my dream
Life in the city is not how it should be

Every time I hear someone say
They don't care they want to throw it all away
I have to reply to it another day

Back road hideout
Left me no doubt
Faith had died out in the town
Back road hideout
I did shout out
Take me away from the pain

Love me my love
Come with me now
Come here my love
On the ride

We'll ride the night
By the sparkling light
Of the bright diamond sky
On the range

Somehow in this fast decline
We lead it to the deep divide
Shoot out passed that hollow blast of flames

It's not hard to recognize
We'll see it on the rise
You must trust your eyes
You're not insane

Back road hideout
Left me no doubt
Truth must be found and revealed
Back road hideout
I did shout out
Who can tell how it's concealed

Love me my love
Come with me now
Come here my love
On the ride

We'll ride the night
By the sparkling light
Of the bright diamond sky
On the range

Every little thing that I have seen
Comes back to remind me in my dream
Life in the city is not how it should be

Every time I hear someone say
They don't care they want to throw it all away
I have to reply to it another day

Back road hideout
Left me no doubt
Faith had died out in the town
Back road hideout
I did shout out
Take me away from the pain
