WE GOT THE NEUTRON BOMB

We got the neutron bomb, 
We got the neutron bomb 
We got the neutron, gonna drop it all over the place 
Yer gonna get it on yer face 
Foreign aid from the land of the free 
But don't blame me 
We got the neutron bomb, 
We got the neutron bomb 
We got the neutron, don't understand you don't know what you mean 
We don't want you we want your machines 
United Nations and NATO won't do 
It's just the red, white and blue 
We got the neutron bomb, 
We got the neutron bomb 
We got the neutron, that's the way it's gotta be 
Survivial of the fittest is the way it's gonna be 
We don't want it, we don't want it, 
Don't blame me 
We don't want it, we don't want it, 
Don't blame me
