PRETTY FLY (FOR A WHITE GUY) VS. GANGNAM STYLE

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.

You know it's kind of hard just to get along today.
Our subject isn't cool but he fakes it anyway.
He may not have a clue, and he may not have style,
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial.

So don't debate, play it straight.
You know he really doesn't get it anyway.
He's gonna play the field, and keep it real.
For you no way, for you no way.
And all the girls say I'm pretty fly (for a white guy)

Gangnam style
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.

Ehh sexy lady
Give it to me baby, a-ha, a-ha!

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice,
But they didn't have Ice Cube so he bought Vanilla Ice.
Now cruising in his Pinto he sees homies as he pass,
But if he looks twice they're gonna kick his lily ass.

So don't debate, a player straight.
You know he really doesn't get it anyway.
The world needs wannabes,
The world loves wannabes.
So let's get some more wannabes.
And hey, hey do that brand new thing! 
Hey do that brand new thing!

Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done.
He asked for a "13" but they drew a "31."
Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip,
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip.
