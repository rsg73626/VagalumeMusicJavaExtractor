GOOD OL' DAY TO DIE

Back in the 18th Century
When the west is wild as the eye could see
Pack up the wife and the wagon get some land for free
Follow this trail to liberty
And ohh, Its a good ol' day to day to die
But I ain't gonna die today

Dangerous road I dont think its not
where the sun is blazin' and my steel is hot
they carry rounds and my guns are out
I go clack clack clack
so they can strech out
In a box, Its a good ol' day to day to die
But I ain't gonna die today

Lost out in the dust, its a hustle its a bustle
Ive been lookin' to hell to get out... alone
Death comes a knockin' like a bullet from the shadow
Oh my god! I'm not ready for the light

Men in black and poachers from the east
So take your wife and the wagon and your family
You're never gonna get out of here alive
So up under this chin I blaze my. 45
I said lord. But Its a good ol' day to day to die
But I ain't gonna die today
