JOHN JAMESON

Well I'm sloshed and seeing the stars
Stumbling between bars
Curse you jameson
You have destroyed me once again
But I need you now
I need you now

I'm bruised and busted now
Got to get to you somehow
Well I can't stop before I start
To dry this drowning heart
Oh I need you now
I need you now
I think I drank more than my fill
And that explains
The evil in my eyes

I'm lost in the middle of a drunk
I'm not sinking
I have sunk
To the shadows at your back door
You scream you don't need me no more
Oh I need you now
I need you now
In this fog there's just john n' me
Help me find the remedy tonight
When there's only wrong in me there's noting
That can lead me to the light

Oh I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
Well I don't need you
There's no flowers, only pain
Behind the empty of your eyes I see the sadness and the blame
In the darkness of my heart there's only shame
Well I'm sloshed and seeing the stars
