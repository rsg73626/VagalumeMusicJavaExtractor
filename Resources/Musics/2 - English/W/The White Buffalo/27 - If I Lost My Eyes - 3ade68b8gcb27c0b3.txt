IF I LOST MY EYES

If I lost my eyes
Would you stay with me
Would you take me by the hand
Tell me what you see

Fill my head with colors for my dreams
If I lost my eyes
If I lost my eyes

If I lost my hands
Couldn't feel a thing
If my touch was gone forever
Out of reach
Couldn't hold you
Like a woman needs to be
If I lost my hands
If I lost my hands

Would you stay
Would you stay
Or would you stray
Just run away
Or would you give me something to believe in
Would you show me the way
You believe so I believe

If I lost my mind
Would you stay with me
Remind me of the man I used to be
Fill my head
With hope times infinity
If I lost my mind
If I lost my hands
Oh, if I lost my eyes

Would you stay
Would you stay
Would you stay
