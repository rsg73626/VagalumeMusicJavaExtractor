MY LIE

Well it's about time to get up off my ass and quit my life
Do something for myself and I might find
Early in the morning when I feel like shit
I got to try before these dreams will end and it's over

You're all over there
I'm already here
I don't trust your lies
I don't trust your lies
Low, low, low, lows
High, high, high, highs
It's my life, my lie

Don't say it's the fear keeping you from here
Don't say it's the lies in a smoke and mirror disguise
Don't think it's all your fault
Early in the morning when there's nothing to live for
I've got to start before these dreams will end and it's over

You're all over there
I'm already here
I don't trust your lies
I don't trust your lies
Low, low, low, lows
High, high, high, highs
It's my life, my lie

Well it's about time to get up off my ass and quit my life
Do something for myself and I might find
Early in the morning when I feel like shit
I got to try before these dreams will end and it's over

You're all over there
I'm already here
I don't trust your lies
I don't trust your lies
Low, low, low, lows
High, high, high, highs
It's my life, my lie
