WRONG

Everyone was staring right at me
Thought I was the pawn, thought that I bought on
So I looked far, as far as I could see
For a way out, out of the crowd
Beedeleybeedeleybop I was baited and I bit the prize
To start the mark of my demise
So alone I look someone to share my strife
I got sucked down the siv of life

With their billy clubs, boys in blue
They come run, running after you
So I fled, I took flight
But I was wrong. wrong, wrong
But at the time it feels so right

The grips were strong and the circle it sealed on me
Thought I was down, thought that I had found
Someone to follow, someone to be
Thought I figured out what it's all about
Feedeleyfeedeley flop I was faded and I fit the crime
Looked at my face, it wasn't mine
Thinking I was right that maybe I should get away
I think twice, then I stay

With their billy clubs, boys in blue
They come run, running after you
So I fled, I took flight
But I was wrong. wrong, wrong
But at the time it feels so right

Colder, colder, got to, got to get warm again
I'm gonna heat it up with my friends
Losing myself I stray to the other side
Fasten my belt and enjoy the ride

With their billy clubs, boys in blue
They come run, running after you
So I fled, I took flight
But I was wrong. wrong, wrong
But at the time it feels so right
