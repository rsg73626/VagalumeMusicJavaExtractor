ROCKY

They say Rocky sold his soul
Well he dipped his balls in rock and roll
He dove head first into the deep
Live for the moment wild and free

Carry on dance too close
To the fire not the phone
Radio silence don't call
Cause nobody's home
When you live life for the lust
Sometimes you get cuts to the bone
But sometimes you get keys to the throne

Oh the neon lights are on parade
Tomorrow swerves into yesterday
No end in sight there's no last call
Just pills and pipes and alcohol

Carry on dance too close
To the fire not the phone
Radio silence don't call
Cause nobody's home
When you live life to the lust
Sometimes you get cuts to the bone
Sometimes you get
Keys to the throne

Sometimes you've got
One foot in the grave
It reaches up and takes a hold
Masters quickly turn to slaves
Souls are bought souls are sold

Rocky creeps the streets unknown
No name no face just a ghost alone
The fix is in no longer free
There's no bringing Rocky back to me

Now he's got two feet in the grave
He dug himself too deep a hole
No dragons left to slay
Devil squeezed out all the hope
Only one God to obey
Reaches down and takes a hold
Now he can't get away

Now he's lost all control
Masters quickly turn to slaves
Streets run black and take him whole
Where souls are bought souls are sold
