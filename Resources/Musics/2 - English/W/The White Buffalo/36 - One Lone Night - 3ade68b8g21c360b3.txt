ONE LONE NIGHT

I'm dreaming wide awake
Sleep walking, shake the dust out
Got to give this heart a break
I can't seem to slow the beats down
There ain't no going home
Just a silence and a wave goodbye
I don't really know about nothin'
Just know that I'm wasting time now

Well, it'll be one lone night
Should I keep drinking 'til the morning light?
Should I settle down just to get my head right?
Should I drive?

And it'll be one lone night
Should I buy a ticket for a midnight flight
Or should I end it all on this here knife?
Oh, should I?

Well, there's no light in lose hope
I got to get back to you somehow
Tongue-twisted - sick joke
Yet there's no way of figuring out
Maybe it's much too late
Time to slow things down
Well, there's torture in the wings
And the weight is too heavy now

Well, it'll be one lone night
Should I keep drinking 'til the morning light?
Should I settle down just to get my head right?
Should I drive?

And it'll be one lone night
Should I buy a ticket for a midnight flight
Or should I end it all on this here knife?
Oh, should I?
Should I try now?

Try now
She says: try now
She says: try now
Try now

Well, it'll be one lone night
Should I keep drinking 'til the morning light?
Should I settle down just to get my head right?
Should I drive?

And it'll be one lone night
Should I buy a ticket for a midnight flight
Or should I end it all on this here knife?
Oh, should I?

Well, it'll be one lone night
Should I keep drinking 'til the morning light?
Should I settle down just to get my head right?
Should I drive?

And it'll be one lone night
Should I buy a ticket for a midnight flight
Or should I end it all on this here knife?
Oh, should I?
She says: try now
