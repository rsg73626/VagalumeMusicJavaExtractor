STORY

I'll tell you a story
Of how the past it lies, it dies
All of your regrets and all of your glory
Oh, how the time it flies, flies by
She said, €œI leave at two
Memories of old fade with the new
Good times and bad we've had a few
Help me to understand what can I do

I'll tell you a story
Of how the past it lies, it dies
All of your regrets and all of your glory
Oh how the time it flies, flies by
Bye, she said, e are through
We once stuck together but we lost the glue
We became one but now add up to two
It was never up to me or to you

She don't need me no more
Time will forget her I'm sure

I'll shut it down but there they go
Thoughts of her fleeting
I wish that I could keep them repeating

I'll tell you a story
Of how the past it lies, it dies
All of your regrets and all of your glory
Oh, how the time it flies, flies by
