HOLD THE LINE

I left home the beloved second son
Filled with promise and a tear drop in my eye
An escape my new life had just begun
With a whisper I did run into the night, into the night

Go where there's dust I chase my shadow from the sun
Fix my eyes on the ocean keep it in my sight
There I sail into a sinking sea of sin no getting out once you've been in
Its not to try, its not to try

Hold the wind hold the line woo who who
Hold the wind hold the line woo who who

Longer at sea I begin to lose my mind
No sense of wrong or right just survive
Sky it guides me where my anger always goes
Into a bottle and overflows out my mind, oh out my mind

Hold the wind hold the line woo who who
Hold the wind hold the line ah, ah, ah
Hey!

Gone where they don't find the open road bottles all I know
I can't get dry, dry
Iv'e lost everything I know
I still can't find, find, the line, hold the line

Hold the wind hold the line woo who who
Hold the wind hold the line woo who who
Hold the wind hold the line woo who who
Hold the wind hold the line ah, ah, ah

Hey, hey, hey!
