I AM THE LIGHT

Im not like all the others
They're too polished for words
All plastic parts in search for perfect tense
Appearances deceive you
Dont chase those holograms
Well theres really no perfection in the end
Theres pain there in your city lights
White lightning in your veins and the truth is that
That I just came to say

There's a dream in side your nightmare
Open up and let it in
Its cold, it is petrified
Lose it now and it wont come again

I am the light, you are the night, you hold the stars
I am where the darkness falls
Its surrounds us all its a call to us
You know that it wont come again

A dream is all I got now
Its tired and running thin
I've long past the point of no return
Not so sure if I belong here am I
Even in the game
Im on the other side where the truth dont lie
Where the time is now and it wont come again

I am the light no wrong no right
You sell the stars
I am where the darkness falls its surrounds us all
Its a call to us
You know that it wont come again
You know that it wont come again
Before the dream throws away
Feels like the light is here to stay
Know the dream it floats away
It feels like the light is here to stay
Lord before the dream throws away
Lord the light is here to stay here to stay
Oh lord here to stay
Here its here to stay
