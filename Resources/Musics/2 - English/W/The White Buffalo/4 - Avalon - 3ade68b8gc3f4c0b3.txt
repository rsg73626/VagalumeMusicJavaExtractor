AVALON

Billy wasn't sober
He got pulled over
In Chinatown
Liquor on his breath
Stuffs a pistol in the cushion
Rolls the window down
Oh well his heart it races like a 100 yard dash
Stone cold on his face
The policeman sends him
Reluctantry on his way

Billy wasn't sober
He was hung over
It was 10 a. m
Another day at work
Clutching the pillow like his only friend
Oh well, he's past his prime he's a dinosaur
Steadfast in his ways
No aces left
But still has cards to play

And he hopes today
He'll swim his way to Avalon
He's not all the way down

He's feeling getting older
The chip on his shoulder's
Getting heavier
The weight of the world
Spins and obscures
Into oblivion
This ain't living
It's waiting around to die
Must be another way
Under his breath
He says things have got to change

He hopes today
He'll swim his way to Avalon
He's not all the way down

Searching but he got no soul
Wishing he could flip a switch
Turn his life around
And face the fact
That life's a bitch

And he hopes today
He'll swim his way to Avalon
He's not all the way down
