MODERN TIMES

I don't know what age it is
Better hole up inside
I don't belong in these modern times
Escape the past dream of another
Call all the guards looks like we got a runner
Kick off the dogs corporate invasion
You can't gentrify the soul of a nation
And I swear the buildings
Moved to me overnight
I don't belong in these modern times

Can't find the lord
He's shaking hands with big brother
Can't hide forever in the womb of your mother
All aboard it's a permanent vacation
Bathe in the water of your mind's mutilation
And I swear the buildings move to me overnight
I'm holding on to days gone by gone by
I don't belong in the modern time

The oaks and the sage in the fields of gold
Birds and bees ain't never been told
The end is near as the morning light
In the maze in the mold I can't see the light
It fades like the days and the fire in my eyes
Destiny laughs in the face of denial
As the world spins by in the modern time
