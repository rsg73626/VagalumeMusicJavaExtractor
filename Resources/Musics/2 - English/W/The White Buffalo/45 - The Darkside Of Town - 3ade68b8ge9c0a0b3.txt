THE DARKSIDE OF TOWN

I'm headin' to the dark side of town
Where the devil gets down
Where my money gets lost and found
I shuffle my feet

And I ain't too discreet
Trouble it flags me down
So I head underground
There, there's nothing that you can say

There's no need to stand in my way
Is this heaven or hell?
They're both gates, just as well
They're all the same, far as I can tell

This body that binds
Gonna leave it behind
See what the devil and me can find
The gates open wide

There's nothing that you can say
There, there's no need to stand in my way, hey hey hey hey
And there's nothing that you can say, hey hey
There's no need to stand in my way, hey hey

In the haze and the highs
Your face comes crashing through my mind
Oh, what shame
I better put you away

What on earth have I become
I can't hide forever from the light of day
It's not what I want
But it's always too late

Headin' to the dark side of town
Where the devil gets down
Where my money gets lost and found
