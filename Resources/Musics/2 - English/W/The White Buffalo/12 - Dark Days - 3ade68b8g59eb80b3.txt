DARK DAYS

Wipe the dust from my saddle
Like an old familiar friend
Life and time will pass you by
Don't worry â€˜bout the shit
That you can't mend

Wash the troubles from my mind
I know they'll never end
Futures looking brighter
We can always ride again

Misfits, drunks and Philistines
I've been them all before
But I know that I don't
Want them anymore

Feel the sun cast my shadow
Growing bigger and brand new
Things to kill the hard times
What's it really matter to you

I've had one constant in my life
The love of my woman
She's everything and in between
I hope she never goes away

Hey dark days behind me
Hope the good days don't blind me

I was out of my mind out of my head
You blew in and showed me love instead
Desperately drowning
A puddle on the floor
You've made me a life worth living for

Misfits, drunks and Philistines
I've been all before
But I know that I don't
Need them anymore

Hey dark days behind me
Hope the good days don't blind me
