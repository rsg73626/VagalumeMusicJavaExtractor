JOE AND JOLENE

Listen
Here's another hard luck tune
Joe lost his job and now he just drinks in the afternoon
He just sits on the porch, staring out at the blue
Toastin' the day 'till the day goes away
then he's toastin' the moon
Oh so his wife up and left
Just a little too soon
For Joey

Jolene she ain't had no easy ride
When Joe lost his shit and his heart seemed to split
when she stood by his side
And Jolene, well you know she ain't no Nun
She drank in the car and she'll dance on the bar
And she's still as hot as the sun
Oh she hopes and she prays
that he'll pull it through
Oh how her feelings ebb and flow
just like the rivers do, for Joey

Joey rolls up his sleeve
I still got your name tatooed
the ink's faded and grey
but it's still serenading you
and a love so true
ah for me and you
Joe and Jolene

Jolene your all I ever had
It's understood, your the only thing good
in my world filled with bad
Jolene, without you I'm all alone
Your my love, your my wife
with you in my life well I'm always at home
Oh I'll put the bottle down
I'll get straight for you
Oh now that you've come home
let's celebrate with one or two
to Joe and Jolene
