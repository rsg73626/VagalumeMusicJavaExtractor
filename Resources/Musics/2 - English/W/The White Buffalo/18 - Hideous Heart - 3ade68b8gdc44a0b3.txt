HIDEOUS HEART

Transfixed on sin
It's always whatching
It shivers my skin
I cannot shake from its sight

Translucent and blue
Shares never blinking
Fueled by booze
Gets me to thinking it's right

The beating is burting my barin
Punishing, pulling apart
The pounding, it drives me insane
Please silence this hideous heart

The madness it grins
Burns me like matches
Blood running thin
Haunting me day and night

Shadows like hymns
From hell and ashes
Calling me, calling me
'bury the evil eye'

Drumming erupts in my brain
Punishing, pulling apart
The pounding, it drives me insane
Please silence this hideous heart

Drumming erupts in my brain
Punishing, pulling apart
The pounding, it drives me insane
Please silence this hideous heart
Silence the hideous heart
Silence the hideous heart
