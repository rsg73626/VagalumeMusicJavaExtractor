INSANE

Lyin' awake in my bed
When I heard voices in my head
Angry voices of the dead
They were in my mind

In my head the voices would stay
I remember when they took ol'
John away
Men in white coats came into his home
An' gave him a jacket of his own

Cold eyes
In my body
Gonna swell my brain

Cold eyes
Makin' me think
That I'm goin'
Insane

Was it evil they bestowed
Or from the heavens were they from the lord
This I tell you I do not know
They didn't give me a sign

Terrified in my bed
Would they join me as the living dead
Would they have me join them instead
Well I don't wanna die

Cold eyes
In my body
Gonna swell my brain

Cold eyes
Makin' me think
That I'm goin'
Insane

I could not keep it bottled 
in my brain
They all that thought I'd gone insane
Men in white coats came into my home
And gave me a jacket of my own

Cold eyes
In my body
Gonna swell my brain

Cold eyes
Makin' me think
That I'm goin'
Insane

Cold eyes
In my body
Gonna swell my brain

Cold eyes
Makin' me think
That I'm goin'
Insane
