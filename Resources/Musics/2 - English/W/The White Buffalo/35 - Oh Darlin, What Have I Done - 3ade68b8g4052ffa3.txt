OH DARLIN, WHAT HAVE I DONE

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Well I've been away from you too long
And all my days have turned to darkness
And I believe my heart has turned to stone

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Now I don't say anything at all
Well god don't listen to the noise
Now I'm left here all alone

Ooh, oh, I hear what the neighbors say
That that poor boy has lost his way
And I let the others pray

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Now I do my talking with a gun
And blood will spill into the gutters
And it will stain the morning sun

Ooh, oh tell me what the hell I've done
Can I stop at one?
Or have I just begun?

Take out the bodies that live
Oh, lord, it gets me high
I think I'm gonna get my fill
Of taking lives

Oh, lord, I don't wanna let my baby down
Well I just wanna give us something one of a kind

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
I've been a stray from you too long
And all my days have turned to darkness
Hell is leaving the light on

And ooh, oh they'll hang me way up high
God himself will drop me from the sky
And let me swing a while

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
(x8)

What have I done?
