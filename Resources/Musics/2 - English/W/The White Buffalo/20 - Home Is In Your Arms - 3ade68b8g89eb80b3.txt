HOME IS IN YOUR ARMS

Your love is a
Mother fucking revelation
And I'm just looking for
A fill-up station
To fill your heart
Just a hoping it starts

Your heart is a flutter
I know it's been awhile
You're falling fast

I know it ain't your style
It's been far too long
So won't you come along

Been spending my days in the rain

Take your sweet time
If you can't decide
I know I've made up
My simple mind
That you're my heart
You're the missing part

I build a place with no walls
Where it's warm inside
And it's made up of you and I
Where our lives are one
And they've only just begun

You're my shelter from the rain
Now I'm home

Home is in your arms
I'm all alone without you darling

Bad boys and the bitches
Come up from behind
They must be deaf dumb and blind
They can't break these hearts
They just won't beat apart

I'll make you mine
Tell you what I'll do
Spend my life making love to you
Till our dying day
Till they carry us away

I'll be your shelter from the rain

Home is in your arms
I'm all alone without you darling

I'll be your shelter from the rain
Now we found home
