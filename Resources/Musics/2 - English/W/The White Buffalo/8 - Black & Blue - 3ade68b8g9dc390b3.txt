BLACK & BLUE

Pack up your shit, we're through
Prepare for black and blue
She slams the door out into the night, she flew
Maybe you'll shut the fuck up
Well it's late, and that's quite enough
I scan the street and I scream off the balcony for you
Love

Drown myself its just as well
Throw my body in the wishing well
Falling appart, spellbound scheming for you
I crawl to the corner store
Courage makes me want you more
I'm fixing my mind
but I'm fucking it up for you

It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you

Pack up your shit, we're through
Prepare for black and blue
She slams the door out into the night, she flew
Love, love, love
