THE OBSERVATORY

Into my mind, into the deep
Taking me up to the observatory
See if the moon and the stars agree

To take me out

Where is the answer?
Where you've been hiding?
What you've been running from?
Two worlds colliding

Everybody hides
Everybody bleeds
Everybody wants
Everybody needs
Love

Maybe I ain't the one
Maybe I ain't the one

Look who rise and calls from the east
Oh the sky, it begs and pleads
Get up boy off your knees
Look around

Everybody hides
Everybody bleeds
Everybody hurts
Everybody feels
Everybody cries
Everybody dreams
Everybody wants
Everybody needs
Love

And I am one
And I am one

Everybody hides
Everybody bleeds
Everybody hurts
Everybody feels
Everybody's right
Everybody's wrong
Everybody's old
Everybody's young
Everybody's low
Everybody's high
Everybody lives
Everybody dies
Everybody cries
Everybody dreams
Everybody wants
Everybody needs
Love

And I am one
I am one
