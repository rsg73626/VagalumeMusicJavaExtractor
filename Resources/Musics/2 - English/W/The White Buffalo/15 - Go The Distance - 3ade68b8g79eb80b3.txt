GO THE DISTANCE

She was down at the bar
At the neighborhood
Where gossip runs quick
When the liquor's good
Truth and drinks
They get watered down
She overheard someone
I was messin' around

People talk and that's understood
But don't listen to him
He's a fucking peckerwood
And all that shit comes off my shoe
Doesn't matter to me
But it matters to you

You and I will go the distance
Take you past the sun to the stars
Your love is my only existence
Your line is just the way I walk

I got a pocket full of money
Full tank of gas
You're not just my woman
You're a piece of ass
Sittin' right at home on a bar stool
You can hold your liquor
But you can't shoot pool

We get hungry on the drive home
Maybe we got drunk
Maybe we got stoned
Well late night at the drive thru
I'll have a number one
She'll have a number two

You and I will go the distance
Take you past the sun to the stars
Your love is my only existence
Your line is just the way I walk

I just wanna be with you
Until my days are through
You are my only truth

You can spend my money
However you want
Throw it in the fire till it's all gone
Defend my honor
Even when I'm wrong
Your heart is like a pistol
And your body's like a love song
