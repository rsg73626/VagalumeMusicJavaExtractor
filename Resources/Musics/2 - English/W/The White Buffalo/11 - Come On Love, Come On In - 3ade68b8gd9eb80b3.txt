COME ON LOVE, COME ON IN

Some say life and love is ever fleeting
Blood and tears will always spill
Days and nights are numbered
You only get one heart to fill

Another day is gone
Another day begins
Come on love
Come on in

The firing squad
It just keeps calling
Boy your time is up
You got no time to kill

Go on and leave me Mama
If that's what you're going to do
So I can get on with it without you

Another day is gone
Another day begins
Come on love
Won't you come on in

Another day is lost
Another day begins
Come on love
Won't you come on in

I don't feel right
Empty as I could be
And I can't breathe right
These holes inside of me
Fool you better call
Your old lady home
She's love she's like a poem
She's everything

Come on love
Come on in
