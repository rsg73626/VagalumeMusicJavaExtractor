HIDE AND SEEK

Looking for my brother
He's a hidin in the field
He's taking deep cover
Out of sight and out of reach
Close my eyes, count to 10
Ready or not here I come again
I can't take eyes to see
That my brother's always been there
He's just playing hide and seek

Looking for my lover
She's a mystery
She keeps it under cover
Deep inside her armory
Hold my breath, count to 10
Ready or notit comes a rushin in
Fills my life whith wonder
It don't take hands to feel
That my love has always been there
It's just playing hide and seek

I can see the light
In fact it's blinding me
It's infinite and bright
Set me free

Searching for the answer
Cloaked and clouded and concealed
Cast away the past and future
Find the truth and honesty

Close my mind, count to 10
Don't you know the power comes from whithin
There ain't nobody else here
If you will it, it will be
The answer's always been there
It's just playin hide and seek
