PRAY TO YOU NOW

How can I leave the past alone?
Now that the end has come along
I can't right all my wrongs
so I'll put 'em in songs, for now

Say goodbye, to the memories and the fear
Will you lead me upstairs to the light?
With my shadows and greys
and my evil ways

Well I pray to you now, I don't know how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?

So long, to the body and the bones
They ain't much use to me now
If my faith isn't blind will I be left behind?

Well I pray to you now, I don't how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?

What's behind the final curtain?
I can't be certain I'm right
All I know is I'm really hurtin'
I'm on my knees tonight

Well I pray to you now, I don't know how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?
Well I pray to you now, well I don't know how
It ain't in my heart, is it too late to start?
