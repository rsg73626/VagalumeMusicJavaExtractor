MADAM'S SOFT, MADAM'S SWEET

Madam's soft, madam's sweet
And madam gets pissed when she don't eat
Money and lust and your mind get blown
You're one-eye drunk but you got to drive home

Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back home

Holding up the wall, weak in the knees
Swing side to side on the stormy sea
Busted dreams and broken phone
Scream and spit in the microphone

Singin, come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back home

Coming in hot on a summer's breeze
Tongue in cheek, toy and tease
Oh, I lie, lie, I bob and weave
If the lord had your body
He could set me free

Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back home

Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back home

I am reborn, you've entered me
Re-defined who I am
I play the role of ecstasy
Lose control of who I am
I'm just a sucker with no plans

Madam's soft, madam's sweet
The madam gets pissed when she don't eat
Money and lust and your mind get blown
You're one-eye drunk but you got to drive home

Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back home

Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back
Come on baby, come back home
