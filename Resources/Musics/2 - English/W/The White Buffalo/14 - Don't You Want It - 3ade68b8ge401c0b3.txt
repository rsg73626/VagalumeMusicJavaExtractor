DON'T YOU WANT IT

Tell me, where the hell did I go wrong
It feels like a lifetime ago
since my fall from grace
Woman, treat me like you want it
Not like you have to
To keep me around

Woman, without you there is no me
And I'll always be your one, you're my everything

Ah well here comes the morning sun
Puts it's arms around everyone
Can you feel it?

Ah oh like the first of spring
Make us all new again
Oh don't you want it?
Like I want it

Mother, when did you let me go
I'm still that dastardly boy
Through a sea of gray

Father, well I still dont know who failed who
But we've got the same bitter blood
running through our vains

AAh well here comes the morning sun
Puts it's arms around everyone
Oh can you feel it

AAh oh like the first of spring
Make us all new again
Oh don't you want it?
Like I want it

Tell me, are there really any answers
The only thing real is love in this crooked world

Ah here comes the morning sun
Puts it's arms around everyone

Ah oh if the love you bring
Take away everything
Oh can you feel it?

Ah oh like the first of spring
Make us all new again
Oh don't you want it?
Like I want it?
