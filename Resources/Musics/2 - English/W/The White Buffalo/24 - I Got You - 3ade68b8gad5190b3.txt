I GOT YOU

It ain't about your bitching
 Or your devil's tongue
I just wish that I was still the one
Every single thought inside my head
Telling me that this old heart is dead
But I ain't got no brains in my heart

But I got you
In my veins, in my blood
I got you
Make me insane and boil my blood
Like there ain't no other love
Hearts aren't always red
They're black and blue
But I got you

It ain't about the dishes
 Or your piles of junk
I'm just sick of you being drunk
Every solitary bone inside of me
Telling me that it's my time to leave
But I ain't got no bones in my heart

I got you
In my veins, in my blood
I got you
Straight to my heart like a flood
Like there ain't no other love
Hearts aren't always red
They're black and blue
I got you
I got you

You can't touch the way I feel
There is no end to what I'd steal for you
With love we have no free will
We only get one heart to fill
 Before it's through

So I got you
In my veins, in my blood
I got you
Straight to my heart like a flood
Like there ain't no other love
Hearts aren't always red
They're black and blue
I got you
