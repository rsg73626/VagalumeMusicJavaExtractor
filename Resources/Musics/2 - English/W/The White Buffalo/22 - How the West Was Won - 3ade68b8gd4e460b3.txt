HOW THE WEST WAS WON

Rolling like a freight train through the night
I can't get your scent above my skin
I'm a loser girl, I'm a little short on site
I wish I knew just how to treat you right!

Oh I need some medicine
I feel your body next to him
Locked like lovers in the night
I better prepare for another hard drinking night!
What would whiskey do? You wont make things right!

Well, I better get my gun
Is that how the west was won?
Is that just what I've become?

I sure would like to think it ain't my fault
How could I blame anybody else?
I'm a fuck-up girl, that's how I live my life
I wish I knew just how to treat you right!

Walk along the avenues
Theres no drinking way these blues
This is how's life's wrecking balls
Can't control myself for what I say or what I do
Shall I end it all?
Well, it won't bring me back to
You!

Well, I better get my gun!
Is that how the west was won?
Is that just what I've become?

Oo oo! Oo oo!

Train's rolling off the tracks!

Oo oo! Oo oo!

Anything to get you back!

Rolling like a freight train through the night!

Oo oo! Oo oo!

Oo oo! Oo oo!

Anything to get you back!
