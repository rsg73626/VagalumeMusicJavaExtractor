THE PILOT

I wish I was pilot,
Soaring over everyone and everything.
Looking at the landscape
What a peaceful tiny scene

Staring over the skyline
Oh I feel the blue dancing on my wings
Turn off the engine
Imagine what tomorrow brings

The time we wont delay
Take it from the other side
Born and lost but its a one more time
To get my fill
Of this old forgotten thrill, this life

I wish I was a fighter pilot
Soaring over everyone and everything
Through the smoke and fire
Imagine the hell I'd bring

The time we won't delay
Take it from the inside
Born and lost but its a one more time
To get my fill
Of this old forgotten thrill, this life

But it's cold, lost and shame
Wash it all out
Wash it all away
Now the story's old
But its all been told
I wish that I
I wish id fly
Alright!

I wish I was an outlaw
Spend my life kicking ass and takin' names
There would be no love lost
Town to town killin dreams.

The lines they turn to gray
Take it from the inside
Born and lost but its a one more time
To get my fill
Of this old forgotten thrill, this life

A one more time,
To get my fill
Of this old forgotten thrill, this life.
