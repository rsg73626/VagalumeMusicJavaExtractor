PICTURE DAY

I tried to hear you out but the writing's on the wall
I turn my phone off cause I know you're gonna call
Don't call my friends in your defense
I set myself on fire now
I'll light a match and watch the flames
burn through my house

I set myself on fire now when I think of you
Pour out the kerosene. Yeah pour it all on me
I felt so compromised like a hammer through the wall
Don't try to get to me cause I'm busy moving on

Don't talk to me
'cause every minute that we wasted
fucking in the basement
Wondering maybe I'm a dick or maybe I'm addicted
It didn't have to be this way with me
but you chose beauty over decency
And now we know you didn't have to be alone

You didn't have to be alone
I tried to hear you out but the writing's on the wall
I threw my phone out cause I'm never gonna call
I'll light a match and watch it burn through my eyes
