DYING

To the bone, until the end
To the bottom, until the end
Even rip up beat
Stick up, fuck up
Up to curdle, to dissolve
Even crack until dawn
Even flounder, to swell
Even apart until its blood
Until whiz until erase
To sleep, until dark
Even lacking air, until it hurts
To empty, to undo
Until you pass until end
Until mock up cushion
Up to calcine, to erode
Until leak until evanescer
Stand back, stand aside
Lying on the ground, stay awake
Standing, sitting
Trying to sleep, stay awake
stay awake
stay awake
By the next day the next day
By the next day the next day
By the next day the next day
By the next day the next day
To death, to death
Until foamy, until boiling
To death, to death
Until dry, to rot
Dying, dying
Dying, dying
dying
dying
