EYES CLOSED

I do not know
I do not care
I do not want to know what goes on in your head
I do not want to know what goes on in your head
When you're dancing
Eyes closed
Eyes closed
I'm not thinking
I'm not thinking
I'm not thinking about what goes on in your head
I'm not thinking about what goes on in your head
When you're dancing
Eyes closed
Eyes closed
