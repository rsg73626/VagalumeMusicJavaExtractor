ONE CAN NOT ALWAYS BE GOD

Not that I regretted
I'm in the mood to laugh
Not that I feel bad
I can do the same
Not that I'm going to do the same
I'll do worse
Not that I'm going to do the same
I'll do worse
One can not always be God
One can not always be God
Why I'm crying
Why I'm crying
Why I'm crying
Why I'm crying
Not that I crossed the line
This for me is normal
Not that I feel good
I can do the same
Not that I'm going to do the same
I'll do worse
Not that I'm going to do the same
I'll do worse
One can not always be God
One can not always be God
Why I'm crying
Why I'm crying
Why I'm crying
Why I'm crying
