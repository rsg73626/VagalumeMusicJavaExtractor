GOD LOVES ORGY

Murder is a passion to the game
The wine, the meat and the deceased
Never correct the divine word
Crime is revered and put to use in society
Stopping them the body of evil that drips
Almost all American wild kill the worms and bad sheets
Cutting a piece of his arm whatever comes
All children born on leap year are chained deep in her crib
Repeating doses of gods that were very agile now died
Eat the garbage that comes from your soul
However, the soul race at the end of last century 
and broke down in the light of their bandanas
Eating the soul of the human being
In Belo Monte, the deep light illuminates, 
the boat's owner kicks the site
Blurring itself traversed the blood in the veins
What shall we do, dear friend?
Breathe the air of the horizon, leaving him speechless
Burning tires in the areas of protests going around the world
Sabbath discuss what the world does not bring
The worst is coming
Vultures eating in China and guillotine on 47th Street
The Irish crushed victims
The Norwegian - pierced skull Ihes
The Gauls were leaving them the basin
The Celts poked them with a saber in hell
Arguments told by a woman who is no better in violence
The local government says it's okay but this is hell
Let the arm drop the world and free your hand to be common
Tomorrow you will die in fear as the undead suck your brain
