TIME TO SPEND

Have time to spend
Have time to spend time
Have time to waste
Have time to play out
Plenty of time to take
The time left to go
Plenty of time to wait
The time remaining from now
I really do not know
What time is it
I really do not know
What time is it
It has plenty of room to where I can see
It has enough space to get lost
It has plenty of room to where I can see
Has room enough to have to stop
I have the whole day to walk
I want to walk all day without direction
I have four walls to topple
I want four walls to put down
I really do not know what month it
I really do not know what day of the year
I really do not wanna know
I really do not wanna know
I really do not wanna know
I really do not wanna know
I really do not wanna know
I really do not wanna know
