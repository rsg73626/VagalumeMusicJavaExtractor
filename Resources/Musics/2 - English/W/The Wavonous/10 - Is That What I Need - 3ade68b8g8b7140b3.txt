IS THAT WHAT I NEED

Who needs to be careful what you say?
Who needs to be careful with what you do?
Is that what I need?
Is that what I need?
No one did anything, nobody is to blame
Nobody did anything else, motherfucker!
Who here is not afraid to spend ridiculous?
Who here as I have the age of Christ when he died?

Who cares what others will say?
Who cares what others think?
Is that what I need?
Is that what I need?
I do not know what you want, or what you like
I do not know what the problem is, its crap!
Who here is not afraid to look ridiculous?
Who here as I have the age of Christ when he died?
