HEREDITARY

Every delivery
Every mourning
Every loss
Every profit
The sun that lasts only one day
Every day, the sun daily
Against what is hereditary
Against what is hereditary

In each sighting
In each wall
In each slit
In each hole
The sun that rises every day
On each anniversary
Contrary to what is inherited
Contrary to what is inherited
Against what is hereditary
