TURN ON THE DARK

You’re moving up slowly
You’re like hands through the water
Oh, I wanted you to see the summer
With me

This morning’s so lonely
I can’t wait to get tonight
Oh, I’m tire of the city lights
It bleeds

Oh won’t you turn on the dark, oh my love
Won’t you turn on the dark

You’re thinking you’re the only
Lover in my soul
But the country’s got an open road
To see

You whisper something phony
The way you used to be
It’s like you’re waiting in a waiting room
For me

Oh won’t you turn on the dark, oh my love
Won’t you turn on the dark, oh my love

(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
You might cover my eyes from the darkest parts
(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
But the night is all that I came to see
(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
We’re coming up to the halfway mark
And all I’m seeing is a trail of sparks
(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
I wouldn’t worry just a broken heart in me

Without trying to underst it,
You’re so mellow dramatic man
Without trying my best to fight it,
’cause you’re so mellow dramatic man, damn, damn

(oh my love, won’t you turn on the dark)
Oh my love

You might cover my eyes from the darkest parts
(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
But the night is all that I came to see
(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
We’re coming up to the halfway mark
And all I’m seeing is a trail of sparks
(oh won’t you turn on the dark)
I wouldn’t worry just a broken heart in me

Oh won’t you turn on the dark, oh my love
Oh won’t you turn on the dark
