RUNNING WITH MY HANDS

I know that I’ve been
Pretty bad
I told you that I’d wait
Then I left

The energy it brings me back
Now I’m running with my hands up
Then I crack

I’m running with my hands up
I’m running with my hands up

You’re making out
With a ghost
Or the letter that they sent
To your door

You’re screaming out
Of control
Emotions, unknown

I’m running with my hands up
(what you do, what you do, what you’re doing to me)
I’m running with my hands up
(what you do, what you do, what you’re doing to me)
I’m running with my hands up
(what you do, what you do, what you’re doing to me)
I’m running with my hands up

I could tell you on the spot
Over casual things like making love

I’m running with my hands up
(what you do, what you do, what you’re doing to me)
I’m running with my hands up
(what you do, what you do, what you’re doing to me)
I’m running with my hands up
(what you do, what you do, what you’re doing to me)
I’m running with my hands up
