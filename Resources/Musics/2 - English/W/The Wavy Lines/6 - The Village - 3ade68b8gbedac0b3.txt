THE VILLAGE

Eventually, You see the sky from your hole
You see the dragons of the night
The stars who occupy the sight

Hopefully, I brought the lies that face your face
"The man will take you, bloody fool"
The drug that entered in your veins

Fairy lazy lady moon
You promised all the drinks and food
If I had the balls to answer you

Wonder, if there's someone disposed to tell
Who was the man that rang the bell
Above the sword at the midnight

Excuses, will not take you anywhere
Thou shall'st not try to ignore the man
Who fight and slay souls everywhere

Fairy lazy lady moon
You promi dearsed all the drinks and food
If I had the balls to answer you

Who was the man driving that carriage
(Strong dear soldier)
Excuse me my lord, but no one here is allowed to say
(Strong dear soldier)
This man that thou're looking for can take our lifes
(Strong dear soldier)
The village die as soon as come the light

Wonder, if there's someone disposed to tell
Who was the man that rang the bell
Above the sword at the midnight

Excuses, will not take you anywhere
Thou shall'st not try to ignore the man
Who fight and slay souls everywhere

Fairy lazy lady moon
You promised all the drinks and food
If I had the balls to answer you
