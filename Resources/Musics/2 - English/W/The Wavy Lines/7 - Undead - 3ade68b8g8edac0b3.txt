UNDEAD

I have come from far a land
Where mountains rise and humans stand
As high as the gods
They dine with the gods

Pardon my intrusion, sir
But I must have things clair before
Hearing thy call
Hearing thy call

What's this haunting place I've came to
What're those letters craved on the stones
How have I come to be here
Oh, I can't see anywhere to go
Wherefore think'st thou to be here
I was sent to pledge only thy soul

Oh no, my soul
Oh no, my soul

Then I shall take thy call
(The stars of the dawn are watching now)

For thee I make a vow
(Fighting against all the feelings)

Let me retake my soul
(For a prize that's already known)

In need I'll slay the world

Then I shall take thy call
(The stars of the dawn are watching now)

For thee I make a vow
(Fighting against all the feelings)

Let me retake my soul
(For a prize that's already known)

In need I'll slay the world
Godspeed
