THE END OF THE BEGINNING

Hide all the scars that you have with you
All the sights that you passed through
All those one that are gone

Hide every blood you just can't refuse
All the feelings you keep inside
Are you full of your mind?

Oh, by the time you forgot to be
Following heavens above the sky
You had fall from the stars
(Come along!)

Are we safe from you and I?
Are we safe within the night?
We are in debt with the gods
We will cross the dunes
Die as soon as come the moon
Can't run at the speed of light

The knights won't take too long
Knights don't delay to take letters from the stones
Keep it inside your mind

I from the hide and seek know how take us home
Even when night in hell not fear anymore
And the winds will come, they're marching from the sea
It's the end of the beginning

And so after weeks of disappearing completely, the undead man
Is back to life, many people were seen feeding him in the streets
Far from what we have ever imagined before
