'NETHERCRACK

In the state of crying
My head is not my friend anymore
Everyone know what it comes
When you are in a swamp

I shall not keep thinking on this
I shall keep not trying to kick
I will slay them till the scream
And my soul know that I'm here

Them may you start praying to you world
The spirits have famine of blood
The oracle have sent his soldiers to

The swamp to try to pull me over
It reflects all the spirits of dead men through
The dark they will want to cut my head
With their totally blind down souls

But I in need will fight against this ocean these men
Breaking their shabby swords
Full Moon is on the sky and I will have the night
(To kill this river of souls)
The swamp to try to pull me over
It reflects all the spirits of dead men through
The dark they will want to cut my head
With their totally blind down souls

But I in need will fight against this ocean these men
Breaking their shabby swords
Full Moon is on the sky and I will have the night
(To kill this river of souls)
