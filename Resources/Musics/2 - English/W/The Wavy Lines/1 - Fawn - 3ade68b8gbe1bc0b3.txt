FAWN

Flying through the sights what you feel in your heart?
I shall not suffer again in his ilusion

Look up to the sky
Know that the gods are there for you
Know that
You're sent to open a divided world

Think'st thou that all this fawn will block me
to save your soul
I know that you are compelled to do
To the mountains we will go

I know the road and you might be alone
Forever we will live together, soldier dear friend
(Safe and sound!)

The Fawn not forgive you soul

Look up to the sky
Know that the gods are there for you
Know that
You're sent to open a divided world

Think'st thou that all this fawn will block me
to save your soul
I know that you are compelled to do
To the mountains we will go
All the spirits you call disappear through the night
Oh, thou think'st all this fawn will block me, to save
Your soul!
