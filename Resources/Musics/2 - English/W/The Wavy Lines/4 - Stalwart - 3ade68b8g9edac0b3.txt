STALWART

Going out of the domain
There is an alluring woman
Half way telling me that know
Sir I want to see your mind explode if you don't get me right
Right, on this question
What is what you should do
When you see a woman through
Front of a gate?

Warriors would do the noble thing
Fight against any other being
Kill and die to protect you
But I propose you to go with me
Would you like to fight with me
Right when I get my soul?

Only if you gimme yer finger and sign with yer blood
In this shabby paper
Sir I want to see your mind explode if you don't get me right
Right on this question
Drink this big cup of water
And tell that you love me
My darling Lord

Think'st thou that I will fall again
In your trick you old man
Take out this poor woman of here
I am in my way to get my soul
But this time I'll let you go
Just to see you suffer more

Think'st thou that I will fall again
In your trick you old man
Take out this poor woman of here
I am in my way to get my soul
But this time I'll let you go
Just to see you suffer more

Think'st thou that I will fall again
In your trick you old man
Take out this poor woman of here
I am in my way to get my soul
But this time I'll let you go, just to see you suffer
More!
