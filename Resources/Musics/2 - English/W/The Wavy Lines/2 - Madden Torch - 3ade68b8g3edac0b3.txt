MADDEN TORCH

I know who art thou
My lord
And I know what thou want'st
I can give the way
My lord
For that just take a toll

Come here
My lord
Need your blood
My lord
Sign here
My lord
Just your thumb

Come here
My lord
Need your blood
My lord
Sign here
My lord
Just your thumb

What paradise is this I am
'Tis eternal?
I feel like I will live forever inside these walls
I drink the wine I eat the bread
I feel alive

Pacta Sunt Servanda
