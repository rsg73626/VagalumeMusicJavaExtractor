SKA SONG

sing me a song
and i'll say that i like it
give me something to disagree with
and i do my best to fight it
i'll follow you, just tell me what do to
i'll follow you, just tell me
capdown, link 80, anarchy, whatever you do
you say you hate me, well i hate me too
give me some clothes
and i'll say i wanna wear them
point out some people to me
and i'll say that i can't bare them
i'll follow you, just tell me what do to
i'll follow you, just tell me
capdown, link 80, anarchy, whatever you do
you say you hate me, well i hate me too
