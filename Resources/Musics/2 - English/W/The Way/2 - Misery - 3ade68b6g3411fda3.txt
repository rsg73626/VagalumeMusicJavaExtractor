MISERY

why doesn't he try and see
what this is doing to you and me?
i wish he could just let it be,
instead of misery.
instead of causing this pain
why can't it be how it was again?
selfish for your material gain
causing misery,
causing misery.
you think that this is what you need.
true, but we don't want to plead.
maybe this is just what you want.
it's not necessary this misery.
slit your wrists and change your mind,
leave all of this shit behind.
what you really need you will never find,
just misery.
why doesn't he realise
what people see when they look into his eyes?
cover up the truth with his lies and misery
and misery.
you think that this is what you need.
true, but we don't want to plead.
maybe this is just what you want.
it's not necessary this misery
