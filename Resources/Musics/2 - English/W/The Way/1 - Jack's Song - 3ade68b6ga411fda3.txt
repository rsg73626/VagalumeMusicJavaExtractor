JACK'S SONG

you broke up with me on saturday.
i'm left here hurting don't know what to say.
i don't know what to do.
all i know is that i still love you.
is this the end of you and me?
i guess it is but does it have to be.
i know i'm missing you.
cos all i know is that i still love you.
why did i let myself fall in love? it was great before but now it hurts too much.
i don't want to see you go.
i know we're over but i want to know.
what made you decide?
i need an answer don't turn me aside.
i'm trying so hard just to be strong.
i want you to know i think you were wrong.
please tell me what to do.
all i know is that i still love you.
why did i let myself fall in love? it was great before but now it hurts too much.
