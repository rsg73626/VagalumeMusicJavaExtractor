PRETEND IT'S OK

I'll have to pretend it'll be alright in the end but it won't.
I'll have to say it's gonna be okay but I don't.
I have to lie just to get by and it hurts.
I'll have to pray it'll work out today and not the worst.
You say "don't worry about me, I'll be fine"
I want to fix things up while there's still time.
Patch it up, make it good as before
and not have to pretend, pretend it's ok.
