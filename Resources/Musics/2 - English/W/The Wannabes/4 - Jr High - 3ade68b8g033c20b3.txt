JR HIGH

Sittin' on the stoop, eatin lunch, watchin cars goin by
Talkin bout boys, passin notes and tellin lyes
Washin my jeans so they're perfectly faded
That was all before I got so jaded

In Jr. High
In Jr. Hi-i-igh

6th grade first boyfriend, holding hands alone
Home at 4, close the door, till I'm on my own
Listen to the radio and writin' in my diary
Wonderin if he would ever talk to me

In Jr. High
In Jr. Hi-i-igh

Kareoke, playing games to the mall, back again
Slumber parties, prank calls, runnin down all the halls
Best friends, enimies, stay up late, till 3
Spin the bottle, chewing gum, don't get caught, had fun!

At the movies PG-13
Not grown-up just in between
Too old to be a kid not old enough
Learnin about life can be pretty tough
In Jr. High
In Jr. Hi-i-igh

7th grade when all the girl got mean
Had to create my own little scene
Somebody had a party and I was uninvited
That's when we all became so divided
In Jr. High
In Jr. Hi-i-igh

(Sings softly into microphone)
In Jr. High
In Jr. Hi-i-igh
In Jr. High
