BRIGHT LIGHTS

Maryah:
I'm stepping out
From this everyday scene
Cause i'm tired of being the girl
They expect of me

Andrew:
Free to be 
Something they haven't seen
It's time to be me
And man 
i can't wait to be

All:
Now i can dance in the white light
It's time to get right
I'm dancing all night white lights
It's time to be me
In the spotlight
The shinning spotlight 
I'm talking Bright Lights all night
