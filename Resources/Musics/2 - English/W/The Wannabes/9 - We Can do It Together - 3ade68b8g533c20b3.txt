WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER

Everything is clear to me
I can see now
This gotta be a chance to see
Someway, somehow

Let me be the one to take the first step
Maybe you're the one that take the next step
We can do it together
We can do it together

(Chorus)
Let's not trying, let's do it
It's gonna take time, but we can do it
Just show me your mind, there's nothing to it
We can do it, don't have to do it alone
We can do it together, together
We can do it together, together

Let's do it together, together
We can do it together

It's start when you and me
One day at a time
We're clean up, we'll be sure to leave
Just pass by

Let me be the one to take the first step
Maybe you're the one that take the next step
We can do it together
We can do it together

(Chorus)

Let's not try, let's do it
Let's not try, let's

(Chorus
