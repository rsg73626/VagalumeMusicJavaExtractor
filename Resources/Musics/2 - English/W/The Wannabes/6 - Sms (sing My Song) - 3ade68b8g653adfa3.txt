SMS (SING MY SONG)

Savvy - SMS (Sing My Song)

I'm hearing voices in my head
It's in my telephone
They tell me things
I don't wanna hear or wanna know
I don't like it,
I'm losing control
But I won't carry on

You hear the bump, bump,
Bumping through your stereo
And I know it stands for somethig
That you don't know
But I like it
I'm in control ohh oh

Refrão:

Stop talking I don't wanna hear anymore
The song you're singing isn't 
something I like to adore
Your melody's been playing in my head for too long
So I'mma teach you how to sing my song
Stop playing games and building up your fantasies
You're wasting time I won't always be your harmony
Your melody's been playing in my head for too long
So I'mma teach you how to sing my song

All these walls caving in around me
I can't breath
I'm suffocated by the pressure of
Your symphony
I can't take this
It's making me ill
But I'm alive to tell

Listen to me, you don't know me
You can't break me, you can't shake me
So back up off me, back, ba-back up off me now
And let me play my song for the crowd

Refrão:

Stop talking I don't wanna hear anymore
The song you're singing isn't 
something I like to adore
Your melody's been playing in my head for too long
So I'mma teach you how to sing my song
Stop playing games and building up your fantasies
You're wasting time I won't always be your harmony
Your melody's been playing in my head for too long
So I'mma teach you how to sing my song

I was feeling the rhythm and beat 'till you came in
And told me the way it was supposed to be
You're making it harder and harder for me
To go on and do me
Why can't you see
Nothing can stop me and nothing can drop me
So might as well give up and hang your head down down
I was feeling the rhythm and beat 'till you came in
And told me the way it was supposed to be
You're making it harder and harder for me
To go on and do me
Why can't you see
Nothing can stop me and nothing can drop me
So might as well give up and hang your head down down

Refrão:

Stop talking I don't wanna hear anymore
The song you're singing isn't 
something I like to adore
Your melody's been playing in my head for too long
So I'mma teach you how to sing my song
Stop playing games and building up your fantasies
You're wasting time I won't always be your harmony
Your melody's been playing in my head for too long
So I'mma teach you how to sing my song

I'm gonna teach you teach you teach how to sing my song
