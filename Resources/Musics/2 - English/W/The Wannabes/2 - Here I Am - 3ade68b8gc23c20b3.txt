HERE I AM

If I never write my novel I'll still live it
I might never get what I wish for I'll still give it
Cause I've got these friends who love me
Even when I'm moody and ugly
And there always ready to hug me
And never tell me who I should be

Here I am Livin'
Dancin' with arms open wide
Here I am Laughin'
Shoutin' out to the sky

I may lose I may win
I may sink I may swim
It's all just part of the fun

Here I am
Breakin' free
I might mess It up but I've only just begun

I might never win a gold medal
I'll find my way
If I never sleep under the stars
I'll be OK

Cause I've got these friends who need me
Even when I'm slfish and silly
And there always ready to hear me
And neever tell me who I should be

Here I am Livin'
Dancin' with arms open wide
Here I am Laughin'

Yeah

Here I am
Bored and Impatient
This is me
A new sensation

Actin' like a (help me out here plez!)
Never fittin' in a clique
Here I am cought in the drama
Here I am so (help again plez!)
I'm changin' my mid everyday
It doesn't matter anyway

Here I am Livin'
Dancin' with arms open wide
Here I am Laughin'
Shoutin' out to the sky

I may lose I may win
I may sink I may swim
It's all just part of the fun

I'm so great I'm so sheek
I'm a star I'm a geek
It's all just part of the fun
Here I am Breakin' free
I might mess it up but I've only just begun
