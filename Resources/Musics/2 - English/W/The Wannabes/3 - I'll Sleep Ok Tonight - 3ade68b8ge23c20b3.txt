I'LL SLEEP OK TONIGHT

Today's gonna be a good day
Look and smile my way, yeah
You look into my eyes and say
I love you for the first time
But you don't know that I exist
You don't know I'm alive

You're not gonna see me break
I will be okay
No matter what you say
I'm not gonna break today
You're not gonna see me cry
No tears will fall from these blue eyes
I'll sleep okay tonight

Everywhere I turn
I see him with her
My heart is breaking
But he's not even thinking
About how I feel
He's erased me from his memory

You're not gonna see me break

I will be okay
No matter what you say
I'm not gonna break today
You're not gonna see me cry
No tears will fall from these brown eyes
I'll sleep okay tonight

Tears on my pillow each night
So harder and harder I fight
I'll make this relationship right

You're not gonna see us break
We will be okay
No matter what you say
We won't break today
You're not gonna see us cry
No tears will fall from these eyes
I'll sleep okay tonight
I'll sleep okay tonight
I'll sleep okay tonigh
I'll sleep okay tonight
