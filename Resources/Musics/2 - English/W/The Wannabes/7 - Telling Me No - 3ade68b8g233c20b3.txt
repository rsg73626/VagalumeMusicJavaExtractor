TELLING ME NO

I never thought that I knew it all
I never thought I could make it on my own
But now I think maybe I was wrong

When someone said I should go
When someone said I could be a star
I forgot the friends I have at home
And I

I really don't wanna say goodbye
But how am I supposed to say
No, no, no, no
Everything's telling me
Go, go, go, go

So why are they telling me no?
It's driving me insane
'Cause everything's telling me no
No, no, no, no
Everything's telling me no
No, no, no, no

I grab my bags and I take a flight
I look away before I start to cry
'Cause deep inside, leaving just feels right
Yeah

My mother says that it's time to go
I look at her and suddenly I know
I was wrong, this is not the time
And I

I really don't wanna say goodbye
But how am I supposed to say
No, no, no, no
Everything's telling me
Go, go, go, go

So why are they telling me no?
It's driving me insane
'Cause everyone's telling me

I dropped my bags and I say, move on
I close the door and I open up my arms
And then I say, I think I'll stay
Even though they're telling me

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

So why are they telling me no?
It's driving me insane
'Cause everyone's telling me
No, no, no, no
Everything's telling me
Go, go, go, go

So why are they telling me no?
It's driving me insane
'Cause everyone's telling me no
No, no, no, no
'Cause everyone's telling me no
No, no, no, no
'Cause everyone's telling me no
