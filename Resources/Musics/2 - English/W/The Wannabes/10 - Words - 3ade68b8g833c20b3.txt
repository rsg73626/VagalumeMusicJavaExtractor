WORDS

I can't lie he's got my heart crumpled in his hand
He walks by and waves hi I just don't understand
Thought I was the one for you
but then I saw you out that girl you told me bout
Looks like I've been made a fool
All I can say is wow

The words were on my lips
I should of took the risk and told you then
How I feel for you I thought you always knew but never said
and now I've made such a mess
I wish I just confessed
The words were on my lips and boy I should of kissed them all away

Hearts on my sleeve and I got all defenses down
Can't pretend that my best friend is just a stranger now
A girl's opinion oh yeah right
Thought it was just your way of trying not to say
It was me you really liked I got it wrong again

The words were on my lips
I should of took the risk and told you then

How I feel for you I thought you always knew but never said
and now I've made such a mess
I wish I just confessed
The words were on my lips and boy I should of kissed them all away

I wanna start again be more than just your friend
And let you know whats in my head

The words were on my lips I never should of missed the chance to say
How I feel for you you never had a clue and it's too late
To make this wrong a right why can't you see the light?
The words were on my lips and boy I should of kissed them all away

The words were on my lips
I should of took the risk and told you then
How I feel for you I thought you always knew but never said
and now I've made such a mess
I wish I just confessed
The words were on my lips and boy I should of kissed them all away
