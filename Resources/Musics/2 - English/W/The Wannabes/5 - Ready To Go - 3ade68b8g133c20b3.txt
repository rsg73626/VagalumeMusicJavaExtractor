READY TO GO

I will trying, trying to find it
But today, I'm not gonna hide it
I've gotta let the world know who I am
And who I can be

I wanna soar like an eagle, across the sky
So I will spread my wings so I can fly away
To the place I'm supposed to be
To be

I wanna be free
I wanna see how far I can go
I wanna be free
'Cause I'm ready to start the show
I'm ready to go, go, go
I'm ready to go, go, go

Now I'm trying, trying to be who I am
I"m not gonna hide it
I've gotta let my light show wherever I am
So the world can see

I heard that I can be more than an average guy
So let them write my name across the sky
'Cause today I'm where I supposed to be
To be

I wanna be free
I wanna see how far I can go
I wanna be free
'Cause I'm ready to start the show
I'm ready to go, go, go
I'm ready to go, go, go

Ohh yeah, oohh
I wanna be free
I wanna see how far I can go
I wanna be free
'Cause I'm ready to start the show
I'm ready to go

I wanna be free
I wanna see how far I can go
I wanna be free
'Cause I'm ready to start the show
I'm ready to go, go, go
I'm ready to go, go, go

OOhh ohh
I wanna be free, yeah
OOhh ohh
I'm ready to go
