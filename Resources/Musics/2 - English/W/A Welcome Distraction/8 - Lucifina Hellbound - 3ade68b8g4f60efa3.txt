LUCIFINA HELLBOUND

There was a time when I told you I would love you
There was a time when I promised I’d would be true
There was a time when I promised you one day you would be my girlfriend

So I wrote this song for you my Lucifina Hellbound
It doesn’t matter what they say, or the stupid shit they’ll sling
I’ll always love you
My Lucifina Hellbound

I vividly recall the day that you threw me down that flight of stairs
I cursed and screamed your name
You just laughed and said you did it cause you loved me
Cause you love me

So I wrote this song for you my Lucifina Hellbound
It doesn’t matter what they say, or the stupid shit they’ll sling
I’ll always love you
My Lucifina Hellbound

So I wrote this song for you my Lucifina Hellbound
It doesn’t matter what they say, or the stupid shit they’ll say
I’ll always love you
My Lucifina Hellbound
My Lucifina Hellbound

My Lucifina Hellbound
