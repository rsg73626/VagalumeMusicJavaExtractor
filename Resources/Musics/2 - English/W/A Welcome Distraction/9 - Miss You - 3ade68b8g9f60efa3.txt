MISS YOU

It’s 2am and I can’t sleep
I’m browsing through my memories
Of you and I side by side just flying along

It’s getting clear
That my worst fear is coming true
And you don’t seem to mind

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I don’t care how far you go
And I don’t care where you’re going

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I don’t care how far you go
And I don’t care where you’re going

Hot damn it’s 4am
The sun is coming up
I must be dreaming
I swore I smelt you scent
God must be playing tricks on me again
Why can’t he just let me be

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I don’t care how far you go
And I don’t care where you’re going

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I don’t care how far you go
And I don’t care where you’re going

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I don’t care how far you go
And I don’t care where you’re going

And I miss you. . . .
