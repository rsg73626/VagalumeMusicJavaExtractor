FATTY, FATTY 2X4

I remember the first time we met
You were at the public park out at the pool
I remember that blue bathing suit
When you jumped in the water
All the water crashed out.
And do you know why?

Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
But I, I love you anyway

And I remember our first date
I took you out to the home town buffet
Talked for hours and hours
And you were so damn cool
But they had to kick us out
Cause the chefs ran out of food
Do you know why?

Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
But I, I love you anyway

Many people have tried to find the one
All I had to do to find the one
Was go to gym
In the cafeteria

Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
But I, one more time

Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
Cause you’re my fatty, fatty two by four
Can’t fit through the kitchen door
But I, I love you anyway
