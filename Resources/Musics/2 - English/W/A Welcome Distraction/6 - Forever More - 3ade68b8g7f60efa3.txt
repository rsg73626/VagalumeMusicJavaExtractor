FOREVER MORE

I listen to the radio
And it makes me sad
Stupid songs about stupid girls
Keep playin’ day by day

What happened to those songs
That made me glad to be alive
To get that feelin’ all I gotta do is
Look directly in your eyes

I know my place
I know where I belong
And that’s here with you
Hanging out at home
I’m flying along the sky above
This road has many twists and turns
But one thing is for sure
With you and I both side by side
We’ll be flying along forever more
Forever more

I prayed to the being high above
That my parents told me of
To see if I don’t end up alone

Some twists and turns
And I found you in a parked Rv
Who would’ve thought that a girl like you
Would fall for a guy like me

I know my place
I know where I belong
And that’s here with you
Hanging out at home
I’m flying along the sky above
This road has many twists and turns
But one thing is for sure
That you and I both side by side
We’ll be flying along forever more
Forever more

I know my place
I know where I belong
And that’s here with you
Hanging out at home
I’m flying along the sky above
This road has many twists and turns
But one thing is for sure
That you and I both side by side
We’ll be flying along forever more
Forever more
Forever more
