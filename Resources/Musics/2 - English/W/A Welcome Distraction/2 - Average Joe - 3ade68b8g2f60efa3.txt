AVERAGE JOE

I had a dream last night
That I was rockin’ out
A sold out crowd

My mama woke me up
She slammed a book upside my head
And said to get a job

And I have no idea where I’m a go
And my mother tells me I am just a fool
And my dad said son it’s all up to you
And I have no idea where I’m a go

Cause I’m just an,
I am just an average Joe

Now I’m in L.A.
I step off the bus
And it smells like shit

A few weeks later
And I’m rockin’ out inside a little coffee house
While the record exec watches on,
Watches on

And I have no idea where I’m a go
And my mother tells me I am just a fool
And my dad says son it’s all up to you
And I have no idea where I’m a go

Cause I’m just an
I am just an average Joe

And now I’m waking up
I’m waking up backstage in my,
My little green room
Who could’ve predicted that someone like me
Could’ve ended up in a place like this

And I have no idea where I’m a go
And my mother tells me I am just a fool
And my dad says son it’s all up to you
And I have no idea where I’m a go

Cause I’m just an
I am just an
I am just
I am just an average Joe
