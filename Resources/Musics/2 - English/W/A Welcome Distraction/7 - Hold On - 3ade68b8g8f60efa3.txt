HOLD ON

I’m strolling through the streets at midnight
Look up at the street lamps as a car rolls by
My troubled minds a violent sore and
Sometimes I forget to just enjoy my life

Times will always get tougher
It’ll only make us stronger
You gotta hold on to the ones you love
You gotta hold on to yourself

I gazed up passed the blinking street lamps
At the endless night sky
And see your face in stars
And for a moment all the stress melted away
A smile creeped up on my face
I’ve never felt so free

Times will always get tougher
It’ll only make us stronger
You gotta hold on to the ones you love
You gotta hold on to yourself

Times will always get tougher
It’ll only make us stronger
You gotta hold on to the ones you love
You gotta hold on to yourself
