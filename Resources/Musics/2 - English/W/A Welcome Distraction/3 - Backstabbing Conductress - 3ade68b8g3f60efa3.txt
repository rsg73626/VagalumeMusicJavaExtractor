BACKSTABBING CONDUCTRESS

It started out just like a story
That first kiss just felt like screwing slowly
And now things are falling off the rails
And I can’t get off
I should’ve saw this from the start

And now you’ve got my heart tied down
As you keep chug, chug, chug, chug, chugging along

You’re my, backstabbing conductress
Will I live on through this
I’m running through the screen of steam
Cause you are my backstabbing conductress
Will I live on through this
As you chug, chug, chug, chug
Over my heart

I should’ve seen this coming
I should’ve been prepared
For all that shit you’re talking
You’d never thought I’d be aware
Your story is always changing
I’ll never get it right
Well baby you’re just digging yourself
Into this deep ass grave now

And now you’ve got my heart tied down
As you keep chug, chug, chug, chug, chugging along
You’re my backstabbing conductress
Will I live on through this
I’m running through the screen of steam
Cause you are my backstabbing conductress
Will I live on through this
As you chug, chug, chug, chug
Let’s go

Cause you are my backstabbing conductress
Will I live on through this
I’m running through the screen of steam
Cause you are my backstabbing conductress.
Will I live on through this
As you chug, chug, chug, chug
Over my heart
