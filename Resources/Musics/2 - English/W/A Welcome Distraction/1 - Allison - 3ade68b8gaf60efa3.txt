ALLISON

I know it’s late
I’m standing here outside
I’m throwing pebbles at your window
I know you are awake

I fell in love with your sultry eyes
I don’t know why I waste my time but
Someone already took your breath away

Oh Allison Oh Allison
Wont you come back home to me
Oh Allison oh Allison
Wont you come back home, come back home
Lets go

After all those years I’ve known you and I’m
To cowardly to tell you I’m in love with you
Cause you’re my sugar in my tea
Without you life just ain’t so sweet
But someone already took your breath away

Oh Allison Oh Allison
Wont you come back home to me
Oh Allison oh Allison
Wont you come back home, come back home,
Let’s go

Oh Allison Oh Allison
Wont you come back home to me
Oh Allison Oh Allison
Wont you come back home to me
Oh Allison Oh Allison
Wont you come back home to me
Oh Allison Oh Allison
Wont you come back home, come back home
Come back home, come back home
To me
