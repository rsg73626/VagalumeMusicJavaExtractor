T.F.M

Driving on my way home
Listen to my stereo
Make’s me want to scream
Prepubescent little girls
At the shows in miniskirts
Ruinin’ the airwaves

Everywhere I look
The world is going down
Hypocrites took over leaving ashes on the ground
Let’s go

Hey! [x11]

And now I’m hanging out at home
Listening to my stereo
Feeling happy and free
Pantera, judas priest, black label society
Makes me wanna raise some hell

Everywhere I look
The world is going down
Hypocrites took over leaving ashes on the ground
Let’s go

Hey! [x11]

Alright!

Hey! [x11]
