FLOODLIGHTS (IN MEMORY OF CHRIS SYMONS)

The sun is out
The birds are chirping
The sky is blue
It’s so damn nice out
And yet it seems
I’m dark inside

My friends and I are altogether
But there are no songs of joy and laughter
The air is deathly still and so am I
God damn I can’t believe you’re gone
There’s nothing I can do
But be here
And mourn you

It’s just like floodlights circling around in the sky
It’s just like floodlights so I can open my eyes
And see into the dark

I still feel, so shaky
From that, that tragic night
It’s haunting me
And I should’ve seen that truck comin’ full speed
But my world was spinning way to fast
Way to fast

It just like floodlights circling around in the sky
It’s just like floodlights so I can open my eyes
And see into the dark
And I’m sorry
It’s my fault
It’s my fault
It’s my fault
