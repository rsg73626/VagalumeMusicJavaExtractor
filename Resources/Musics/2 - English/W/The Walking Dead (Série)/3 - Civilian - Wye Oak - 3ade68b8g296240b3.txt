CIVILIAN - WYE OAK

I am nothing without pretend
I know my faults
Can't live with them
I am nothing without a man
I know my thoughts
But I can't hide them

I still keep my baby teeth
In the bedside table with my jewelry
You still sleep in the bed with me
My jewelry, and my baby teeth

I don't need another friend
When most of them
I can barely keep up with them
Perfectly able to hold my own hand
But I still can't kiss my own neck

I wanted to give you everything
But I still stand in awe of superficial things
I wanted to love you like my mother's mother's mother did
Civilian, civilian
