BLACK - KARI KIMMEL (SEASON 3 TRAILER)

When everything has turned to black
You don't know where to go
You need something to justify your soul

Silences are broken
Confidence is gone
When everything you're holdin onto falls

(yeah)

All the people selling truths
On every corner now
They wait until fear has knocked you down

All the rules are changing now
You're living in sin
Everything arround you's caving in

And all you hold onto's slipping
Like water through your hands

And you sing: lalala, lalala, lalala

Far off in the distance
Somewhere you can't see
Allegences have formed your destiny

Opposition all around
Feeding off your soul
Trying hard to swallow up your hope

And demons all around you waiting
For you to sell your soul

They're singin: lalala, lalala, lalala
