HEARTBEAT

Was bleeding from my eyes for you enough, dear?
Or spending all those useless nights alone
Those chemicals I took won't straighten out me

Cos my head's still spinnin
And my heart's still beating

Told you never had to return my Heartbeat
Told you never had to return my Heartbeat
Told you never had to return my Heartbeat
Told you never had to return my Heartbeat

Now was everything you said to me a lie? 
All those nights you left me hangin on the phone
Those chemicals I took won't straighten out me

Cos the drugs ain't workin
And my heart's still beatin

Told you never had to return my heartbeat
Told you never had to return my heartbeat
Told you never had to return my heartbeat
Told you never had to return my heartbeat

You never lived alone.
You never lived alone.
You never lived alone.

Told you never had to return my heartbeat
Told you never had to return my heartbeat
Told you never had to return my heartbeat
Told you never had to return my heartbeat

heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
