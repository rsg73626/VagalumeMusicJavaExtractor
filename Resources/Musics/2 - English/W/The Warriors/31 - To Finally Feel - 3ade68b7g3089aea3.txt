TO FINALLY FEEL

I HEAR: The song of 1,000 voices 
(call me) 
1,000 voices remain 
(Contentment kills all the pain) 
I hear: - the voice of a crying son 
- a song of desperate rage 
- the laughter of 100 hearts 
( - and the pain of 100 more) 
And if you listen 
All these! Cries Combine 
One voice for All (Unspoken 
Ties that bind!) 
I've wanted for this hour - 
Now it's finally arrived 
I've waited for this hour all my life 
To hurt, To feel, to finally feel
