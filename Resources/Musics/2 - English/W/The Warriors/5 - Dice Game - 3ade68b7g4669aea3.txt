DICE GAME

Now I see: Everything in front of me. 
A gamble if I win or Lose 
The world of the sense amused with: 
The Banishment of lovelessneess/happiness. 
(And it doesn't seem far away from a Loaded Dice Game) 
Brainwashes creep up inside of me 
No matter what: remember where you came from 
From a city that always sleeps 
(T-Town in a Burdened Tweak) 
Betting the table again and its disappointing to say.. 
Throwign Dollars away... 
Blank Stare (Willfull Decline) 
With Nowhere to turn I think I'm losing my mind. 
Soul Sickness of: - The rich 
- The weak 
And theres nothing left 
But Nothingness 
(The Agony of honesty honestly wished away)
