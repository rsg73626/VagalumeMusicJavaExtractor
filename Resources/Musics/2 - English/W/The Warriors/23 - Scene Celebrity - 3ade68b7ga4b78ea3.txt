SCENE CELEBRITY

Safety: Off (An Introduction)

Scene Celebrity

You “paid your dues.
”Now you think that we owe it to you?
Wake up from your self righteous haze, and realize you mean nothing; a worthless charade.
You’re a scene celebrity.
You have no right to look down on me.
Hardcore; my life and my pride.
How can you sit back and judge my life as a lie?
One more time.
Pushed aside my life and my pride.
Special no thanks that you put on the side.
Taking me than what you put in.
You have to act tough, talk tough, to hide what’s inside.
My life, my pride.
