WAR IS HELL

Wake up and I wipe the sleep from my eyes.
With a breath of strength.
I’m late; that’s no surprise.
At war with time.
Alarms like land mines.
Your face shows it all with each cut and scar.
It takes strength to remain in these times of war.
You’ll never recover so don’t look back.
Just keep your chin up high and back he next attack.
Enemies drop bombs of fire again.
Full fledge front line with all of my friends.
The size of your heart determines who wins.
Modern day life; let the fury begin.
War is hell.
