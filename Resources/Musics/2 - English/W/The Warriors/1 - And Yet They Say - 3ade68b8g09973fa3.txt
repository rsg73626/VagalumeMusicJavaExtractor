AND YET THEY SAY

Heartache replaced with a calmness of being
(Accepting all that i used to deny)
Waking up in the heat of a blazing sun
Beyond the noise,
Beyond the decay.

(But) I travel light cause i don't know the way
Without the way within (the way within)

And yet they say... x 5
Forget (forget) 
Repress today
And yet they say
Forget (forget)
No urgency

Never again will I torture or kill to find a secret beyond the debris
I couldn't grasp the key
(I couldn't see)
That it was here with me x 2

Now I could never believe
(In your shroud of apathy)

Now I could never believe
I've let you have a peice of me
Now I can never return
With the walls of flame the bridges burn

Not with a match
Not with a match
Not with a match 
But with a blowtorch x 2

With walls of flame the bridges burn
Not with a match but with a blowtorch

With walls of flame the bridges burn
Not with a match but with a blowtorch

Going down the way within
(Going down the way within)
Not with a match but with a blowtorch

Going down the way within
(Going down the way within)
Not with a match but with a blowtorch
