LIGHTNING STRIKES

Lightning strikes again.
To waken life within.
A shock runs through our hearts.
Our veins are torn apart.
And into night we fled, with thoughts of home inside our heads.
We found the latches locked.
In the rain all night we knocked, and knocked and no one came.
Forgotten voices voiced in vein.
Truth did free my mind.
Fear locked the door behind.
And now weâ€™re all alone.
Outside the walls we once called home.
