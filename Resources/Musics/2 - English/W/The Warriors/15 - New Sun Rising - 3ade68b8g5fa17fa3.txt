NEW SUN RISING

From every broken window pane.
From every life worth being saved a light will shine again to thaw the frozen, pierce the clouds again.
Breathe in light, or take in your last breath.
There is no truth more absolute than death.
They said this darkness lasts, again they're proven wrong.
As the moon moves past, far past-far gone.
You've go to breathe in light for a new sun rising.
One last breath for a new sun rising.
I've traveled far across a frozen sea in search for life, now looks like life found me.
Breathe in life, or take in your last breath.
There is no truth more absolute than death.
This urban wastelands screaming.
Out here life has no meaning.
We're waiting on...we're waiting on...we're waiting on for death.
Resistance is born in the light of a new uprising, rising.
Hide from the light if you're not with the new sun rising, rising.
A new sun rising.
