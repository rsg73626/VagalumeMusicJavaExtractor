SHADOWS OF BIRTH

We will not waste words.... 
Unfulfilled, Insatiable thirst. 
Another way (Another way worth seeking light 
From the Shadows of Birth 
BReak my fall 
The Life 
That's in front of me 
Minus the insanity 
SIlently its trifling 
(Staring Back) 
No Cure for this weight 
(I'm staring back) 
No Cure for this weight.
