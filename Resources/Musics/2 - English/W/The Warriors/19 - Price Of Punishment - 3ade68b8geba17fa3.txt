PRICE OF PUNISHMENT

This young man ain't breathin'.
This young man is leaving.
Icy hands won't unclench their fists.
Emergency, emergency.
Suffering to breathe!
Hurry hurry, not dying in vain means being remembered.
When life's taken spinning and playing back toe memories won't be mistaken.
This young man is bleeding.
This young man's retreating from the punishment of constant pain and now the time has come to meet his fate.
Who could have thought the price of punishment could justify the price of ignorance?
They said it was because my temperament.
But I don't know, I guess it's redundant.
Hurry hurry, not dying in vain means being remembered.

Fear won't take us.
Who would have thought the price of punishment could justify the price of ignorance?

But I don't know, I guess it's redundant.
