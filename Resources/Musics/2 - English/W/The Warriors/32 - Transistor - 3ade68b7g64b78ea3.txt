TRANSISTOR

Resist.
The world I see is just not right.
Were going to burn it.
Were going to burn it tonight.
Weâ€™ve got these punks locked in our sights.
The ignorance I pledge my life to fight.
Transistor.
Resistor.
Send me a death wave.
They destroy us from the inside out.
Let the virus corrupt us throughout.
Resist.
Resistance.
