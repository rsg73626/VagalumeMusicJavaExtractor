DOWNBEAT

I lost myself a thousand times... 
Now I succumb to senses blind. 
It's all or none. 
(No glory in the goal of some 
All or none its black or white 
(No strength now for shades of grey) 
I THIRST! I DREAM! 
I BURN! - I SCREAM... 
I slow my heartbeat 
Indifference holds my sanity 
Yet just intoxicated. 
By thoughts of Self 
(This worldly frame! This cage! This Hell!) 
Unknowing Fool I Am 
To join its Ranks and spectacle 
Open your eyes (Everything lies)
