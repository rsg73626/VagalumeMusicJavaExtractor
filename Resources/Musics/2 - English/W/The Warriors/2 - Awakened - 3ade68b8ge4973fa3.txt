AWAKENED

(Look again)
reflected, terrible emptiness
perfect ones slumbered here
(seeking death?) horrified
flip the switch-awakened
recognize fully recognize wretchedness
this gloden cage has kept you locked away
mesmerized by all the worthless games
you play
why arent you satisfied
(ill rise twise as high)
breakdown arise
twice as high
