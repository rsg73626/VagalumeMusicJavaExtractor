SILENCE IS BLISS

So let's pull this plug and just give it up, live it up.
So what suffers now?
Just give it another whirl.
I feel the same, feel the same.
Feeling no emotion.
Are we happy now?
What's left to say, what's left to say?
Not another dull moment to get in my way.
Not today, no tonight.
We've come into our own.
Now who's ready?
We've come into our own.
So get ready.
We're so sincere in our hearts, we're so sincere in our pains, in our thoughts in our ways
But who's numb now?
Tonight's the night where the wrong turn to right.
Building downward spiral surged into afterlife.
So who's numb now?...
Desensitize me...
It don't matter much.
Are we happy now?
It's pure bliss.
Unfortunate, fortunate ones get crushed again.
Are we happy now?
What's left to say, what's left to say?
Now another dull moment to get in my way.
Not today, not tonight.
I feel the same.
Now who's ready?
I feel the same.
So get ready!
