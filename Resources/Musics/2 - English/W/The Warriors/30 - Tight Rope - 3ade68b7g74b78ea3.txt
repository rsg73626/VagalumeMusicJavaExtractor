TIGHT ROPE

Walk another day on the tight rope.
Say your prayers and hold on tight.
Did you know that they live on the wire?
Did you know that they waste so much time?
It's time to lose.
You break.
You'll pay for your mistake.
In tears for years.
Endless, sadness is broken?
I think you must be joking.
The sorrow is endless, it's blinding madness.
