VITAL EYES

Hugh spun language, but we’re not hearing the words.
It spoke to us at birth, it said “Men, when something starts there’s got to be an end.
”The mind, it suffers more.
Heads up to the sun when the world turned cold.
Blind as a bat to forever unfold the lies that were taught to the young by the old.
There hearts are stone but once gold.
There eyes are wide, their tongues are tied, they’re sold.
Bound and gagged and thrown into the cold.
Living suicidal, trying to understand, this worlds on wheels.
Build it up, watch it break.
Giving up, there’s no way.
Listen up, you’ve got a lot to learn.
Inside lies a purpose driven life.
High spun language, but we’re not hearing the words.
It spoke to us at birth, it said “Men, when something starts there’s got to be an end.
” Cycles die and then begin again.
Pinned by inner demons.
Sing the anthems call: We’re born, we lie, we live, we die.

[Chorus]
Living life in denial of death, fearing death in denial of life.
