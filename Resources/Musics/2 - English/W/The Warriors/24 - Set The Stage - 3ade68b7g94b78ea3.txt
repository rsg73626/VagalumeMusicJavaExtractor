SET THE STAGE

Set the stage.
The ambush begins.
Through the windows, the doors were all breaking in.
Did you think we would let you win?
In fear you froze and slow goes your grin.
Satisfaction of defeat calms the plenty for a while.
The decay of a species cure this worlds will to die.
I live my life by choices.
Never thought to question why.
No more remorse in sight.
You know itâ€™s all I have.
The sky in reach.
My eyes start the trembling.
