NOTHING LASTS

Few words possess the guilt trip that's expressed.
Another word for trapped is created by identity lost.
I've lost all words to say.
A broken code of dignity.
Pitiless perseverance, see it be unleashed on the broken ones.
Time passed cause nothing lasts.
I remember the last thing that you said, "Follow your path and use your head."
Sometimes in face I gotta make my way I know.
I know I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone.
It's true that nothing lasts.
Now so much time has passed us.
Everybody lives to the rhythm confused on where to go.
I'm so tired but I can't sleep.
My tongues tied and I can't speak.
These tears run down my cheek, I know I've lost all words to say.
Life's more than a heartbeat.
The only candle that lights the day.
Can't lose my recollection.
Time passed cause nothing lasts.
I remember the last thing that you said, "Follow your path and use your head."
Sometimes you know it's hard when life is cruel.
Just do my thing
You know I understood everybody lives to a rhythm.
Knowing that I know I'll see you soon.
Time that passed.
Nothing lasts.
I remember the last thing that you said.
I understand.
Follow your path and use your head.
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts.
Sometimes it's hard when life is cruel.
I understand, I understand.
I gotta make my way I know, I gotta make my way I know.
