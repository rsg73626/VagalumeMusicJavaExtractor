MANKIND SCREAMS

So many times I-every time denied.
So many times I justified everything defending a name.
Soft world of fantasy.
Illogical fallacy...Ripped to shred by cerebral force.
Well I don't waste my time.
Look hard and you will find a victim of some injustice.
I'm not sorry for things: The pain that the truth brings, nostalgic energy, time for strength and meditation.
Mankind screams for attention.
Ripped to shreds.
Ripped to shreds by cerebral force.
Routine was never the leader of an important new movement.
People want to know what obstacles mastering impatience.
Behind a mask of ice there beats a heart that's truly on fire.
Everyone's afraid, we're all the same, we're all enraged!
Ripped to shreds by cerebral force.
Nostalgic energy. Ripped to shred by cerebral force.
Nostalgic energy.
I'm not sorry for things: The pain that the truth brings, nostalgic energy, time for strength and meditation.
Mankind screams for attention.
Ripped to shred by cerebral force.
Mankind screams!
