I WON'T

Escape! - And they may say: 
I'm a coward 
That these pursuits are in vain 
But I will sprint 
I will sail away 
(For fear of Running in Place in this place) 
Desertion But now they say: 
Its in Fear 
That I'll be: Broken, Guilted, Cheated 
(That I'll never change anything) 
But you never see me fail 
On the Bright Side 
(You can catch me looking up on the Dark side) 
Thew weill to seek another way 
I can't stand, I can't stay, 
I wont' fare another day 
I won't sleep, I won't Stay 
Not yet myself (I've just begun) 
(Not yet alive in these small town slums) 
From Prying Eyes: I have to run! 
Never a victim or a fortunate son. 
But I got to believe 
it can't change the times 
It can't stop the tides 
But I t can change the mind 
(escape)
