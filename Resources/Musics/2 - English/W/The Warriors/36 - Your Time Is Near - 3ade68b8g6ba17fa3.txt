YOUR TIME IS NEAR

Your time is near spare me your tears.
No judgment here just constant despair.
When will it end, when will it end?
It's time to break this cycle.
I watch you sink. (Why do you think what you think?)
Now did you really think(about what's really going on.)
That I've forgotten how (When will it end, will it end?)
A fresh kid went so rotten?
With this annoyance.
I will destroy it.
This beast who commonly thinks the only cure is more disease.
Go around like you're as cold as your attitude.
With a problem or a clue, it's not really you.
Drop that, cause you don't need that.
Just can't miss what you'll never have, feel that.
I watch you sink. (Why do you think what you think?)
Now did you really think(About what's really going on.)
That I've forgotten how (When will it end, will it end?)
A fresh kid went so rotten?
When will it end, when will it end?
Now why do you think what you think, when will it end?
Your attitude about what's really going on.
The only cure is more disease.
Break this cycle.
Because your time is near.
Break this cycle.
