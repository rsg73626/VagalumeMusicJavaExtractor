RED, BLACK AND BLUE

You wage a war that warrants no worries.
A coward’s shrug.
Bank bullets and stories.
Your lies they victimize but I am the lion.
Where I spit a fire starts.
Outspoken hearts.
Restless as sharks.
I smell the fear on your breath.
With salvation your soul I will test.
And now the fury starts to shake me.
Here’s to the black and blue.
You die for me, and I die for you.
No sympathy.
Fury deliver me.
