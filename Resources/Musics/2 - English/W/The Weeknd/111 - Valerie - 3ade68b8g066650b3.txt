VALERIE

[Verse 1]
There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
There are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say

[Pre-Hook]
Like I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's goin' to know if it's true

I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight)
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know

[Bridge]
Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

[Hook]
Valerie
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies)
Valerie (oh Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No you just don't know what I do, what I do, oh Valerie)
Valerie
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby
But I think I might know)
Valerie (I know, Valerie)
You'd rather this than be alone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh woah)

[Bridge] (x2)
Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if its true

[Outro]
And I love you
(Cause I love you baby)
And I need you
(When I need, need...)
I only want you
And nobody gonna know
