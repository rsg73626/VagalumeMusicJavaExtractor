THE ZONE

[Verse 1 - The Weeknd]
Why you rushing me baby?
It's only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight baby
So lemme sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed
And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'mma touch you right
I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'mma touch you right

I'mma touch you right (let me sip this slow)
I'mma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
I'mma touch you right (just let me)

And I'mma lean, till I fall, ooh yeah
And I don't give a damn
I felt the ground before

I left it all behind, baby
I didn't need no one
But I'm here tonight baby
I've been alone for too long
Ohh, oh yeah
So, I won't say a damn thing

I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right

I can't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing

But I'ma touch you right

I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah (let me sip this slow)
I'ma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
I'ma touch you right (just let me)

[Drake]
Woah, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man if pole dancing's an art you know how many fuckin' artists I know
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favours I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well, girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it being going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That Ovo and that Xo
Your girlfriend at our next show
But its all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
You don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit, I did all of that on my own
Oh yeah
