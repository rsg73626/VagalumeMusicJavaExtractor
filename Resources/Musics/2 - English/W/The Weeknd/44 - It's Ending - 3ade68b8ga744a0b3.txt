IT'S ENDING

Time's passed, you got older
You get on my bed
Time's passed, you can't feel love
I've got hope, I'll take it
Left me, she got?

Sleep on it, babe
I've been killing, don't payin' it
She gon' pay it in
I've been feeling you get what you want
You know about baby

Only you can tell me I do
Only you can tell me I do
How are you gon' tell me about you?
How are you gon' tell me about?

She like your body turn tonight
She'd be loving life
Getting older now
Getting older now

She may?
When it's all been left
When it's all been left
When it's all been left
