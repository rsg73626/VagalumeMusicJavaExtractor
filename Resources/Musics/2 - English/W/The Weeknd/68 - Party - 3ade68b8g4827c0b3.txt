PARTY

See the rides pull in
And the place pack up
Only enter if you've got a dime
Saw a cutie on my right
Catching everybody's eye
Man nobodies going home tonight
She said she p-a-r-t-y
Took a shot of 'trone
Left her worries on the side
And she down for whatever
Everything anything but clever
Then the track starts to play

She started singing like woah oh
Ooh she started singing like woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh
This is my song, this is my song

Now she's drinking all her problems
Like a god damn alcoholic
Ain't no way she is going to remember tonight
Shawty show me how you do it
Hold your drink before you lose it
Panties dropping by the end of tonight
She say she p-a-r-t-y
Took another shot
Now she is tripping on a guy
And she's down for whatever
Ain't know way it gone be clever
Then the track starts to play

She started singing like woah oh
OO she started singing like woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh

P-a-r-t-y
Hear she got a twin on the side like fries
Her eyes are glowing
Her mind is blowing
And they better look this good in the morning
Show off the pairs, better yet I got two
And you know they all loose
With ru-ruffle tattoos
Call me mike myers
I'mma kill this grey goose
I'mma take my last shot
And we gonna make glue
Wipe the shit off the floor
Don't take off your shoes
Girl I got a sweet tooth
I can bite you if you choose
And if I catch ya man
I'mma swing like babe ruth
So it'd be best for him
If you kept this on the low-que
I can beat that pussy up girl
I can bruise you
And talk dirty in your ear like a bluetooth
Girl put your worries in the pot
Add some water stir it up
And watch me make magic so long to tragic
And when we get to morning
Make it scramble like static

Woah oh, woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh
This is my song this is my song
Woah oh, woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh
This is my song this is my song
