KISS LAND

When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth she can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again
I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit baby
I'm a little camera shy
But exceptions can be made baby, 'cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here
Only takin' pictures, you gon' have to take your ass home
 
'Cause the only thing you're takin'
Is your clothes off
Go 'head girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Oh girl, don't hold back,
Let it out
 
Get on top of my thang girl
Get on top of my thang girl
Oh girl, don't hold back
Let it out
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Don't hold back
Let it out
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Don't hold back
 
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right, I might
Fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my west coast girl
Until they book a show in Nyc
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep whoah oh
I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong, and never sleep until it's mornin',
'Til the morning, cause the only thing you're takin'
Is your clothes off, ey
Go 'head girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk, whoah oh
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Ooh yeah, don't hold back
Let it out
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Ooh girl, don't hold back
Let it out
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Whoah oh, don't hold back
Let it out
 
Get on top of that thang girl
Get on top of that thang girl
Oh yeah, don't hold back (don't give up)
 
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside,
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just twelve months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up and
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day, just to sleep at night
God damn I'm high, my doctor told me to stop
And he gave me something to pop
I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends,
I got Xo in my bloodwork and I'm posted up down in Florida,
Ft. Lauderdale to that Mia
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk,
White Russian when the sun hits,
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings,
She like the way my whole tongue flip,
She grind hard for tuition,
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills,
I make her suck it with gold grills,
In the back room of the Vip, she don't ever sleep
 
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried,
You tried, you tried
And you tried
You tried, you tried
And you tried
You tried, you tried
And you tried
You tried
 
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried
You tried, you tried
And you tried
You tried, you tried
And you tried
You tried, you tried
And you tried
You tried, oh yeah
