WHAT YOU NEED

I just wanna take you there 
He dont gotta know it 
Does he touch you here like this 
Lemme take the friction from your lips 

And I'ma love you girl 
The way you need 
Ain't no one will stop us 
Ain't no one will stop us 
And I'ma give you girl 
Oh what you fiend 
I'm the drug in your veins 
Just fight through the pain 

He's what you want x4 
I'm what you need 
What you need 
What you need 
I'm What you need 
What you need 
What you need 
He's what you want x4 
I'm what you need 
What you need 
What you need 
I'm what you need 
What you need 
What you need 

Ive got everything you want with me 
Ill do everything he does times three 
And he dont gotta know 
I got you on the floor 
Doing things you've neva thought you'd do 
Baby leave the high heel shoes 
Cuz I love it when you're lookin' down at me 
I'm lookin' up at you 
And I dont give a damn shorty 
Watch me knock them boots off 

And I'ma love you girl 
The way you need 
Ain't no one will stop us 
Ain't no one will stop us 
And I'ma give you girl 
Oh what you fiend 
I'm the drug in your veins 
Just fight through the pain 

He's what you want x4 
I'm what you need 
What you need 
What you need 
I'm What you need 
What you need 
What you need 
He's what you want x4 
I'm what you need 
What you need 
What you need 
I'm what you need 
What you need 
What you need
