NOTHING WITHOUT YOU

I realized, I belong to you
I feel the darkness, I run away from you

Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)

I was too busy tryna find you
With someone else
The one I couldn't stand
To be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)

Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it?

Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
Oh, I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)

I was too busy tryna find you
With someone else
The one I couldn't stand
To be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)

When I feel the love, girl I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch
Touch, touch, touch
(I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing')
(Nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing')
(Nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you)
(Without you, without you, without you)
