I WAS NEVER THERE (FEAT. GESAFFELSTEIN)

What makes a grown man wanna cry?
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
What makes him wanna take his life? (Yeah)
His happiness is never real (real, real, real, real)
And mindless sex is how he feels
ooh, he feels

When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter (it don't matter)
It won't matter (matter)
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
(time, it's time)
It won't matter (it won't matter)
It won't matter (ya)
It was like I was never there
(It was like I was never there)
It was like it was more than thin air, oh
When it's time, when it's time
when it's time, oh baby
It won't matter, it won't matter, baby

When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
It was like I was never there
It was like it was more than thin air
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter

When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It' won't matter, it won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter

Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (in my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it

And it's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Woah, woah
Don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Ooh, no
