TRUST ISSUES (REMIX)

[Drake]
Call up I'm drinking... let's
Let's call up um (Uh)

All I care about is money
And the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it
I'ma smoke until it's done

[The Weeknd]
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is on paper
She don't need no fucking love

[Drake]
I don't really give a fuck
And my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older
somebody should have t...

[The Weeknd]
She's spillin' all this liquor
Tryna pass me all these cups
Well baby girl I'm phonin'
Somebody should have told her

[Chorus]
I popped one
Fuck it I popped one
Oh girl I'm on one
Fuck it I popped one
I popped one (A strong one)

[Drake]
2 white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one (Fuck it I popped one)
A strong on (I popped one)

[The Weeknd]
Girl I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry this aint new
Can we take this to your spot... fiction number 2
Cause I popped one

[Drake & The Weeknd]
Fuck it I popped one
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah, oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Trust issues
Fuck it I popped one
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah, oooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Drake]
You know what I'm sippin
I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one
Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slipping
So you're the only one
Cause I don't trust these bitches
They might they might catch me slipping
And put in something different
So you're the only one
Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

[The Weeknd]
Do you know whats going on over here (I do, I do, I do)
Have you even bothered to look? (I do, I do)
Well if you know, than let me know
We don't have to keep runnin' in these circles (In these circles)
No more

[Drake & The Weeknd]
Ho oh trust issues
Ho oh trust issues
Ho oh trust issues
Ho ohhh

Trust issues, no more
Trust issues, no more
Trust issues, no more

[Drake]
Drizzy drake check me out
Coming live from the mu-fucking north side
Kick game run game run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell I can tell I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they didn't really make 'em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still let them girls in
And tell 'em all leave them cellphones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day wit' it man Am to the Pm
Niggas hatin' I just wish they would say it when I see em all

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's pro'ly why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for somethings and I think that I can find them
In you in you

[Drake & The Weeknd]
Ho oh trust issues
Ho oh trust issues
Ho oh trust issues
Ho ohhh

Trust issues, no more
Trust issues, no more
Trust issues, no more
