INITIATION

Oh yeah
 
Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that Xo, she climbing
Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living
The party won't finish it's a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
Ah, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We be going all night, til light
 
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
 
You've been going hard baby
Now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Don't mind
All my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you testing, baby if you dancing
Grab a cup of that Xo, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up them teeth
And it's fucking hard to sleep
 
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out
 
Work that back til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby
 
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out (ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah)
Ooh yeah
Come over here and ride it out (ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah)
ooh yeah
