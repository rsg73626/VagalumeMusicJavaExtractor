LONELY STAR

If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong kind
Promise me you'll all love me one day you'll remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face.
My body is yours
Happy Thursday
 
It seems like pain and regret
Are your best friends
Ooh, oh yeah
'Cause everything you do leads to them
Right, right, right,
Yeah, but, baby, I could be your best friend
Ooh
Baby, I could fuck you right ooh
Whoah
 
Baby, you can have it all
Ooh whoah
Baby, you can have it all
Ooh yeah
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes
The jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah
 
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes
The jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star
 
Woah
You're blaming all your sins
On your best friends ooh, oh yeah
And nothing's ever ever your fault
Nothing's your fault, baby, no
But baby, you don't need
Your best friends woah woah woah yeah
'Cause I got everything you want hoo ooh ay yeah
 
Baby, you can have it all, ooh baby
Baby, you can have it all ooh
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes
The jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star
Baby, you could be a star
 
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes
The jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah
 
If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Let the wrong doing come with me
One day I'm hoping that you will remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me every Thursday
I wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist only on Thursday
 
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday
 
I love the guitars
