STARGIRL INTERLUDE (FEAT. LANA DEL REY)

[Lana Del Rey]
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratching counter tops, I was screaming
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop
Uou were hitting it
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, (I love it), Starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy

[The Weeknd]
I just want to see you shine
'Cause I know you are a Stargirl
I just want to see you shine
'Cause I know you are a Stargirl
I just want to see you shine
'Cause I know you are a Stargirl
I just want to see you shine
'Cause I know you are a Stargirl
