APPOINTMENT

Got my fancy clothes
And the candles lit
Dinners getting cold
Can't quit seem to sit
I have been anxious all day
Ever since you called, you callled
Got the water running
Just like you said
Now my body's burning and I start to sweat
I could never do what we do all alone
Alone

Girl its half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You've been busy in my head
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you

Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment

Now I feel the urge I hope you feel it to
Now imagine girl what I am gonna do to you
Girl the image of your body got me sprung, me sprung
Never felt like this about another one
You are killing me cuz is half past one
My body trembles every time my clock agrees

Girl its half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You've been busy in my head
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you

Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment

Girl its half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You've been busy in my head
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Say it's noon
I got to feel you, freak you

Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appointment
Come to, come to my appointment
