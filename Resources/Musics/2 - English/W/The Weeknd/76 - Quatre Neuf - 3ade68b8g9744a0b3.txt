QUATRE NEUF

I'm not sweating, no way
Such a throw away
Got them sweating off a
All day girl, our love

And I don't take you for nothing
I'm good for you, don't you lie
Girl you know I can get sexy for you any, anytime
Yeah, just like you are, you are

Holding back every little urge that you have for me
You are, you are waiting to be saved girl
Only reasons, reasons you love me so easy to feel
But I feel like it's always like don't you hit me after
And I have

Now you're naked
Now you're naked
Join the?
Now I won't have it
Now you're naked
Now you're naked
Join the?
