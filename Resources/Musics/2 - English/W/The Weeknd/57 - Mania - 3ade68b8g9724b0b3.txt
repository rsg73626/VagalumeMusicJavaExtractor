MANIA

The reasons I can't have you
Are so easy to fix
I didn't really plan to
But Imma do it for this

The reasons I can't have you
Isn't so complicated
Baby if you let me I won't hesitate
All I know (all I know, all I know, all I)
All I know is this
All I know (all I know, all I know, all I)

I ran outta tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
Cause too many people think they made me
Well if they really made me, than replace me
Homeless, to forbes list
These niggas bring no stress
I feel like I'm moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you're with my nigga
Then your girls single to me
I don't give a damn
If a nigga said you knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever son me
My flow too sick
Kevin costner couldn't touch me
I know you wished that nobody ever loved me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well this is the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem
Through a queen street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me
Pull up in that aventadors
Just know we be grinding on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't know ever lie
Show me all the sides
They don't let me down
Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want him too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin, talkin
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep
When you talk, talkin, talkin
I'm find ways to articulate
The feeling I'm going through
I just can't say I don't love you
Cause I love you
It's hard for me to communicate
The thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm going to let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinking
I see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
Your scared to be lonely
Especially in the night
I'm scared that I miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feeling
I can't afford love
I tried to find me some
To pull us apart
It ain't working cause your perfect
And I know that your worth it
I can't walk away
I'm good I'm good I'm great
Know it's been a while
Now I'm mixin up the drink
I just need a girl
Who gonna really understand
I just need a girl
Who gonna really understand
I'm good I'm good I'm great
Know its been a while
Now I'm mixin up the drink
I just need a girl
Who gonna really understand
I just need a girl
Who gonna really understand
And I seen her get rich on the pole?
I seen her I knew she had to know
I seen her take down that tequila
Down by the litre
I knew I had to meet her
OO she mine
OO girl bump and grind
OO she mine
OO girl bump a line
Angelina
Lips like angelina
Like selena
Ass shaped like selena
I'm like
Got up thanked the lord for the day
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
(woke up by a girl I don't even know her name)
Got up thanked the lord for the day
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
(woke up by a girl I don't even know her name)
Paranoid, paranoid, paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid, paranoid
But I see something in ya
Paranoid, paranoid, paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid, paranoid
But I see something in ya
Got up thanked the lord for the day
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
(woke up by a girl I don't even know her name)
Got up thanked the lord for the day
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl I don't even know her name
(woke up by a girl I don't even know her name)
You're paranoid
Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step by step
I can see it in your eyes
Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
You've been scared of love
And what it did to you
You don't have to run
I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch
And it can set you free
We don't have to rush
When you're alone with me
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming
I feel it coming baby
You've been scared of love
And what it did to you
You don't have to run
I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch
And it can set you free
We don't have to rush
When you're alone with me
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I know what you feel right now
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I know what you say right now, babe
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I know what you say right now, babe
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming baby (I feel it coming baby)
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming baby
I feel it coming baby
