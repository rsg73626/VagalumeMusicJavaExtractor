WHEN I (PULLING UP DEMO)

I don't really know, when I know you're saying
I've been living down, every note you're saying
I don't mean enough, but I know you're saying
I've been taking all you know, but I know you're saying

Ooh when I know yourself
Ooh when I know yourself

Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up

I don't really know, when I know you're saying
I've been living down, every note you're saying
I don't mean enough, but I know you're saying
I've been taking all you know, but I know you're saying

Ooh when I know yourself
Ooh when I know yourself

Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up

I was posted up in berlin when you called me
It was early, yeah
I just got that picture that you texted
You look ready, girl don't tempt me

I'm flying down, to shut it down
You tryna buy your ticket to me
Seems like my name, I'm the hottest shit around
Whatever makes you feel like you the baddest bitch around

I know that your other man, got feelings for you
Well now that I'm calling back, but you got history
And I want to know you, but no I. d
I don't wanna say nothing babe, to nobody

I make it to, she gave her selfie
I make it to, I know you gon' be
I made it to tomorrow baby
I make it to pussy
I made this song
I don't be on, shut the fuck up

Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
