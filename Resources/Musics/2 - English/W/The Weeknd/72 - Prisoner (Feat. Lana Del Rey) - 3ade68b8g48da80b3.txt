PRISONER (FEAT. LANA DEL REY)

You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined
To end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson
Let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know

[The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo, woo, woo
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo, woo, woo

[Lana Del Rey]
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long
Cause I can feel my soul burning
Feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined
To end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson
Let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know

[The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo, woo, woo
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo, woo, woo

[Lana Del Rey]
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams
