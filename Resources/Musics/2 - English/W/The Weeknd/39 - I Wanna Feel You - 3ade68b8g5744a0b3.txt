I WANNA FEEL YOU

They start rumors about anything
They wanna ruin us and get crazy
They talking reckless and no one talk love
I see the light and now I get taller

Oh baby, I just wanna get love found
I look at you and now I get taller
I see that you gon' work your tempo
I'm [?] I'm gon' stay low

They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
Make love to, make love to, make love to
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
All that love, all that talk, give me love
Say you will say, say you will say, all you will say, oh love

I need you, I need somebody
If it's true, I need somebody

They start rumors about anything
They wanna ruin us and get crazy
They talking reckless and no one talk love
I see the light and now I get taller

Oh baby, I just wanna get love found
I look at you and now I get taller
I see that you gon' work your tempo
I'm [?] I'm gon' stay low

They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
Make love to, make love to, make love to
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
All that love, all that talk, give me love
Say you will say, say you will say, all you will say, oh love

I need you, I need somebody
If it's true, I need somebody
I need you, I need somebody
If it's true, I need somebody
