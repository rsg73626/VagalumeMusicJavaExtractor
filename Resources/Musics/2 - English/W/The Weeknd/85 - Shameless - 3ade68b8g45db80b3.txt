SHAMELESS

Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna love you like me, like me?
Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna touch you like me, like me?

Ooh, said you wanna be good
But you couldn't keep your composure
Ooh, said you wanna be good
But you're begging me to come over
Ooh, come over
Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me? Yeah

I don't wanna hurt you
But you live for the pain
I'm not tryna say it
But it's what you became
You want me to fix you
But it's never enough
That's why you always call me
'Cause you're scared to be loved
But I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
Girl, I have no shame
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
Girl, I have no shame

Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna love you like me, like me? Yeah
Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna touch you like me, like me?

Ooh, said it'd be the last time
All you needed
Was a little closure
Ooh, said it'd be the last time
But you're begging me to come over
Ooh, come over
Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me? Hey

I don't wanna hurt you
But you live for the pain
I'm not tryna say it
But it's what you became
You want me to fix you
But it's never enough
That's why you always call me
'Cause you're scared to be loved
But I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
Girl, I have no shame
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
Girl, I have no shame

Who's gonna fuck you like... hey

I don't wanna hurt you
But you live for the pain
I'm not tryna say it
But it's what you became
You want me to fix you
But it's never enough
That's why you always call me
'Cause you're scared to be loved
But I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
Girl, I have no shame
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you
Girl, I have no shame.
