EARNED IT

I'mma care for you
I'mma care for you

You make it look like it's magic
Cause I see nobody, nobody
But you
I'm never confused
I'm so used to being used

So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moments expected
So I'mma care for you
I'mma care for you, you, you

Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it

You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it
No mind
We live with no lies
You're my favorite kind of night

So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moments expected
So I am care for you
Ima care for you, you, you

Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it

On that lonely night
We said It wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe
It was only us
Convinced we were
Broken inside, Inside

Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
