WONDERFUL

Yeah, yeah

Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah

Work it like a stripper, yeah
But you not a stripper, yeah
Dog her down with ya, yeah
Work that nine to five with ya, yeah
After smoke a pound with ya

Oh my, on a vibe, what a wonderful time
Hundred deep all my niggas outside
Valet park when I pull up in the ride
Oh it's late you might
Have to spend the night, yeah

Oh, I love my city late at night, yeah
Oh, I love my bitches when they bite, yeah
Oh, let's call some up
And let's get right, yeah
Ohh (yeah)
We just landed in your city, go time
Driving to the venue
Like we're seeing no signs
She got all the passes
She don't ever do lines
Bustin' like she's single
She ain't wasting no time
You cannot record, that's for the show now
Leave your phone, you get that later on now
Pour that special drink
That's for my throat now
And take a sip

Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah

Work it like a stripper, yeah
But you not a stripper, yeah
Dog her down with ya, yeah
Work that nine to five with ya, yeah
After smoke a pound with ya

Oh me, oh my
Why they wonderin' who the kid sleeping side?
I been up sleepless late nights
Override yeah, overdrive yeah
(oh) bag it, bag it up, just bag it up
Yeah, we gon' try this one more again
I been mobbin' edge
Scoping through the lens
These thoughts is on my mind
Got me on the drive
Got me on the ride
To a wonderful time

Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah
Oh my, what a wonderful time
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah

Work it like a stripper, yeah
But you not a stripper, yeah
Dog her down with ya, yeah
Work that nine to five with ya, yeah
After smoke a pound with ya, oh
