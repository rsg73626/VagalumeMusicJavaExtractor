PROFESSIONAL

It's ideal oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
 
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone
Got you trippin' got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
 
All this time
This ain't you
I decide
When we're through
 
I love
You love
This love
We're professional

What da fuck does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes it's way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's supposed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you've put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again
Oh yeah
 
I love
You love
This love
We're professional
I know
You know
We're sophisticated
At lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'
 
All of those nights you were up early holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself all when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oh, how did you drain, all the soul from your eyes
How did you teach, teach yourself, how to smile
In a world (in a world)
Where your dreams (where your dreams)
Can't be real
No
Every touch
That you sell
Is a lie
 
I love
You love
This love
