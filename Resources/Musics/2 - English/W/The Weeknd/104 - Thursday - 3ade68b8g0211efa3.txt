THURSDAY

[The Weeknd]
I love her, today
Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late
I don't need to know if you're feeling when I'm free

Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday but on Thursday...Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty
Ohhhh on thursday, baby get ready ohhh on Thursday
Woaahoooh hold it ohh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday, baby only Thursday

Can I try? Can I try?
I've been here for too long
Baby don't cry
When are you calling again?
But It's not Thursday, baby why you calling?

Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday but on Thursday...Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty
Ohhhh on thursday, baby get ready ohhh on Thursday
Woaahoooh hold it ohh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday, baby only Thursday

Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday
