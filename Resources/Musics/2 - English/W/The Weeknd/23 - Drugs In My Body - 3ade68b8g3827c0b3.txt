DRUGS IN MY BODY

The sky is green
I'm feeling out of place
Bottle of rum all to my face
I don't need a car
I don't need a chase
Lonely streets I'm looking for you

The sky is green
I'm feeling out of place
Bottle of rum all to my face
I don't need a car
I don't need a chase
London streets I'm looking for you

A couple of clouds
I see your face
Pull through the hurt
Try to embrace
Poison in my soul
Drugs in my veins
Anything you want baby I will do
Girls, girls, girls, go

The days they go slow
The nights they go fast
It's only some time
Til we get together
I'm out on the street
I'm waiting for you
Do you hear me looking?
The method is clear
In waiting for you
I think I need a distraction
I'm not staying in
I'm searching for you
I can never find you

Go downtown put the drugs in my body (whoah)
Step back up I'm the life of the party (whoah)
Come back home
And we'll get somethin started (whoah)
Stay up late
Put some heat in my heartache (whoah)
Go downtown put the drugs in my body (whoah)
Step back up I'm the life of the party (whoah)
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Go downtown put the drugs in my body

Go and hop on a train
There's no one on board
I should take a cab
But I can't afford
Lost my money, I lost my phone
I just wanna make it home
Losing my voice
I need it autotuned
Memories she
But I remember you
And love's a stain, it only brings pain
Take another hit
Don't wanna be sober, oohh

Go downtown put the drugs in my body (whoah)
Step back up I'm the life of the party (whoah)
Come back home
And we'll get somethin started (whoah)
Stay up late
Put some heat in my heartache (whoah)
Go downtown put the drugs in my body (whoah)
Step back up I'm the life of the party (whoah)
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
