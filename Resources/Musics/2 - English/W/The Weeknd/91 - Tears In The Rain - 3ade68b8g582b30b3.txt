TEARS IN THE RAIN

(Refrão)
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Because no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that come
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become

(Refrão)
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Because no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that come
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become

(Verso 1)
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
Dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
Because I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch (they all feel the same)

(Refrão)
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Because no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that come
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become

(Verso 2)
I should've let you leave
But, I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But, I'm selfish
I watched you stay

(Ponte)
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

(Ponte)
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

(Refrão)
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Because no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that come
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become

(Ponte)
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
