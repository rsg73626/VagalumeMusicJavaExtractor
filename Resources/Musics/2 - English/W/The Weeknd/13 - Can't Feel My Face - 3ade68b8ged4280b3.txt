CAN'T FEEL MY FACE

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
And stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "you'll never be alone"
Oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary
When we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know

She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "you'll never be alone"
Oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it

She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "you'll never be alone"
Oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it

I can't feel my face
