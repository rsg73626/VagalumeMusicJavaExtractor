RESCUE YOU

Saw your signal from afar
Lonely heart sitting at the bar
I'mma try to save you from his flames
Come with me you don't have to think
You had a long day I can tell by your drink
Take a look at me, I promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

Do you always seem to fight cause I (can tell)
Don't shed no tears and I (can help)
Help you through your misery, hospitality that you need from me
And I, I can hear the pain inside (your voice)
Call you every night but that's a choice and I can take it all away

Let me rescue you, I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you, let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be you superhero
Fly you through the stars
Let me light up your darkness
I can be you superhero

Tryna' free you from this cage
It's a mental prison break
Baby we can leave, my heart is the key
You're a damsel in distress
Looking at your eyes I can see the stress
Take a look at me, I promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

Do you always seem to fight cause I (can tell)
Don't shed no tears and I (can help)
Help you through your misery, hospitality that you need from me
And girl, I can hear the pain inside (your voice)
Call you every night but that's a choice and I can take it all away

Let me rescue you, I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you, let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be you superhero
Fly you through the stars
Let me light up your darkness
I can be you superhero

I can take you away (take you away)
From the darkness and the pain ( darkness and the pain)
Girl, I promise every moments for you
Show you never ending love ( never ending love)
I can bring it from above ( bring it from above)
Girl I can heal your wounds

Let me rescue you, I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you, let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be you superhero
Fly you through the stars
Let me light up your darkness
I can be you superhero
