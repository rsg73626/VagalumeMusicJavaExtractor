WANDERLUST (PHARRELL REMIX)

(Verso 1)
It was so hard to say the same thing
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Girl don't hold onto your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care

(Hook 1)
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

(Verso 2)
You're too shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Don't patronise
You know tonight
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
Because tonight I'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care

(Ponte)
(Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
(I give it all to
You)
I give it all to you
(Precious little diamond)
Precious little
Diamond

(Hook 2)
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
They're in love with this idea of love
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

(Ponte)
(Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
(I give it all to
You)
I give it all to you
(Precious little diamond)
Precious little
Diamond
