X-RAY

I'm looking through you like an x-ray
I'm trying to figure if your love? s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

Beaming through your door
I see right through your faults
Eyes tryna feed me more lies
Girl I'm on top, of all your little side plans
All your little side mans
All in for your waist and I must have been out my mind

Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

I'm looking through you like an x-ray
I'm trying to figure if your love? s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

I'm looking through you like an x-ray
I'm trying to figure if your heart breaks
Can it break, is it fake
Should I wait? am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

Running through them boys
You play me like a toy
And 'bout to here that noise
When I find out your thoughts girl
Sweating on the outside shaking on the inside
Girl I'm reading your mind (and it's filled with lies)

Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

I'm looking through you like an x-ray

Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

Girl you're out of love
(girl you know you're out of love so)
Packed up all your stuff
Girl you had your chance but
This time, this time was your last
