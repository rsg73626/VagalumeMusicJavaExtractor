D.D. (DIRTY DIANA)

[the weeknd - verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you please let me be
I've been here times before
But I was to blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying that's ok
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back
She trapped me in her heart

[hook]
Dirty diana, no
Dirty diana, no
Dirty diana, no
Dirty diana
Let me be!

Oh no . . .
Oh no . . .
Oh no . . .

[verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's says that's ok
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

[hook]
Dirty diana, oh
Dirty diana, no
Dirty diana, ooh
Dirty diana
Dirty diana
Dirty diana, nooo
Dirty diana, nah
Dirty diana, no no
Dirty diana
Let me be...

[verse 3]
She said I have to go home
Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to
Say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
And then I ran to the phone
Sayin' baby I'm alright
I said unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's slepping with me

[hook]
Dirty diana, oh
Dirty diana, oh
Dirty diana, oh
Dirty diana, no
