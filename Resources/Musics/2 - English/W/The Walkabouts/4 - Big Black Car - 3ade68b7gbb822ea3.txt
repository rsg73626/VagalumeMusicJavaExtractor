BIG BLACK CAR

( written by Alex Chilton )

Driving in my big black car 
Nothing can go wrong 
I'm going and I don't know how far 
So, so long 

Maybe I'll sleep in a Holiday Inn 

Nothing can hurt me 
Nothing can touch me 
Why should I care 
Driving [ ? ] [gas?] 
It ain't gonna last 

Sunny day, highway 
If it rains it's all the same 
I can't feel the fear (?) 
I can't feel a thing 

[ ? ] Big black car 

Nothing can hurt me 
Nothing can hurt me 

[ ? ? ? From here on I just can't make it out . . . ]
