FUCK YOUR FEAR

A rumble in my bones 
A cold sting on my lips 
The reckoning is almost here 
Fuck your fear 

New gravediggers born each day 
Diggin' holes right where you lay 
The reckoning is almost here 
Fuck your fear 

  This don't seem like the end 
  It seems more like a bad beginning 
  Don't hesitate 
  Fuck your fear 

Weakness coughs, then ricochets 
Our boredom bleeds us wide awake 
The reckoning is in the air 
Fuck your fear 

Dead folksingers lie in state 
Acolytes scrape off their plates 
The message falls onto deaf ears
