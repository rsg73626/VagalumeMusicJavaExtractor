UNWIND

You're an open gate 
On a barbed wire fence 
Swingin' back and forth 
You know it scares me half to death 
Funny how it moved 
From a blessin' to a curse 
Ain't it funny how we moved 
From the cursed, to the doomed 

Will you 
Will you unwind 
This heart of mine? 
Heart of mine 

Busted but not broke 
Shaken up and stirred 
Watch out who you tell 
This night is hangin' on each word 
But when the mornin' comes 
And the lies are cheap 
You'll say: "to live is to lose" 
I'll say: "losin's the one thing... that we all keep" 

Will you... will you unwind? 
This heart of mine... heart of mine 

Both a blessin' and a curse 
In everything we've heard 
A blessin' and a curse 
This night is hangin' on... each... word
