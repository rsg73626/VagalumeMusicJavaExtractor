LOOM OF THE LAND

It was the dirty end of winter 
Along the loom of the land 
When I walked with sweet Henry 
Hand upon hand 

And the wind it bit bitter 
For a girl of no means 
With no shoes on her feet 
And a knife in her jeans 

Along the loom of the land 
The mission bells peeled 
From the tower at Saint Mary's 
Down to Reprobate Fields 

And I saw (that) the world 
(Was) all blessed and bright 
And Henry breathed softly 
In the majestic night 

O baby please don't cry 
And try to keep 
Your little head upon my shoulder 
Now we'll go to sleep 

The elms and the poplars 
Were turning their backs 
Past the rumbling station 
We followed their tracks 

My hands they burned 
In the folds of his coat 
Breathing milky white air 
From deep in his throat 

O baby please don't cry 
And try to keep 
Your little head upon my shoulder 
Now we'll go to sleep 

I told him the moon 
Was a magical thing 
That it shone gold in winter 
And silver in spring 

And we walked and we walked 
Across the endless sands 
Just me and my Henry 
Along the loom of the land 

O baby please don't cry 
And try to keep 
O baby please don't cry 
And try to keep 
Your little head upon my shoulder 
Now we'll go to sleep
