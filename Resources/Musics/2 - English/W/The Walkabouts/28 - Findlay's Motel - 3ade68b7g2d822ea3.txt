FINDLAY'S MOTEL

Findlay was on his last legs 
But he made the rules 
Said suffer fools gladly 
But never end up as the sufferin' fool 

He shook me down 
Though it was my first week on the job 
Said travellers will trick you 
But you will find out all them things for yourself 
Yes you will 

Findlay he threw me the keys 
As he walked outside 
And he turned on the big neon sign 
But only half of it burned 

And I was there fightin' off dreams 
When she pulled in the drive 
The sound of her wheels woke me up 
And there she was, standin' inside 

By the stretch 
Of a pine barren road 
Where the night 
Never did what was told 
(I never did what was told) 
Rooms for the night 
Room for your rest 
Rooms for the night 
At Findlay's Motel 

She looked like she had come down 
From the rattlesnake hills 
And she pushed the gun to my jaw 
And told me to clean out the till 

As I handed her over the cash 
Findlay limped in 
The old man he reached for her gun 
But she was stronger than him 
Yes she was 

By the stretch 
Of a pine barren road 
Where the night 
Never did what was told 
(I never did what was told) 
Rooms for the night 
Room for your rest 
Rooms for the night 
At Findlay's Motel 

Now bullets don't care what they hit 
And Findlay went down 
And she dropped the gun to the floor 
And said, you best call somone now 

But my eyes they were fixed on the door 
And I walked straight outside 
Said suffer fools gladly 
As long as this sufferin' keeps you alive 
For a spell
