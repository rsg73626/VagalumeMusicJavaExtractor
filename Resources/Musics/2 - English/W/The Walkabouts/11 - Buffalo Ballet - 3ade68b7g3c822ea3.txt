BUFFALO BALLET

When Abilene was young and gay 
And thunder storms filled up the days 
The cattle roam outside the town 

Sleeping in the midday sun X4

Then tracks were laid across the plain 
By broken old men in torrid rain 
The towns grew up, and the people were still 

Sleeping in the midday sun X4

We all joined in 
(And) We all joined hands 
We all joined in 
To help run this land 

Then the soldiers came, long long ago 
Rode through the town 
And mowed down those 

Sleeping in the midday sun X4

Gold came and went, quickly spent 
And the people broke down 
And often drowned 
From the wealth and the pain 
Of old Abilene 

Sleeping in the midday sun X8
