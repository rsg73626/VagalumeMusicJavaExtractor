THE NIGHT WATCH

I'm the nightwatchman and nothing gets behind my back 
Work out at the goldmine in a tin can shack 
Don't come up behind cause I won't be mincing my words 
Don't play twenty questions with all of the scavenger birds 

I'm the nightwatchman 

It's up to me and the devil to do all the dirty work 
Got a thousand dirty secrets rolled up in the sleeve of my shirt 
Don't come up behind me, I will be playing for keeps 
Don't do this for good looks, I'll do this so someday I'll sleep 

I'm the nightwatchman 

I know about secrets, I know what secrets are worth 
Gold is a secret, they're draggin it out of the dirt 

Yes, I'm the nightwatchman
