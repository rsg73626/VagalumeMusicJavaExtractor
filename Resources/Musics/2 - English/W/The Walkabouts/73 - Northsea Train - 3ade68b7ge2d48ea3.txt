NORTHSEA TRAIN

The rain crawls up the coast 
I know you hate 
This one-way chase 
A drunk, his wife and her friend 
The drunk tries to stand 
The friend says lay right there 
Now it's all tower blocks 
And blood blue flags 
And closed up shops 
The guardhouse light turns off 
As the rain stops cold 
crawls back alone 
They're lining up the last suspects 
Beneath a rusty glow 

The Northsea train's on time 
Northsea train 

The procession is unsure 
It's full of strays 
With mongrel names 
They know not what they've done 
And at least today 
That'll be okay 
Hooded coats in zigzag rows 
Draggin' coal back to their homes 

Northsea train's on time 
Northsea train 

Collecting pieces of us all 
As if their cargo, will break our fall 

Northsea train's on time 
Northsea train 

Vanquished from all 
Rhyme and duty 
I'm struck and stranded 
Vanished neath the beauty 

Northsea train's on time 
Northsea train
