BLUE HEAD FLAME

tongue tied, said my prayers
20 years or more
seems like yesterday

hung your secrets from
the judas tree
watched 'em blow down
to the valley floor
blowin' home, watched
'em blow away

and what I fear is what we all fear
a fortune lost, a fortune gained
cursed by the power of the
blue head flame

got so drunk, I took things back
things I never said
things I never stole from anyone

dug in the clay, red on my hands
guilty to the elbows, 
never mind my hands
kept my nose clean, 
kept it that way for you

now what I fear, is what we all fear
a fortune lost, a fortune gained
cursed by the power of the
blue head flame

watched the freights from
the railroad tie
spun a rusty nail, and I closed
both eyes
as I told my tale, as the
freights went by

straw of pity on the
courthouse stairs
wait till doomsday, you said
wait for years
I couldn't wait that long, 
I shoulda' killed for less

now what I fear, is what we all fear
a fortune lost, a fortune gained
cursed by the power of the
blue head flame

ya what I fear, is what we all fear
humble origins all betrayed
lost to the power, we were
lost to the flame

tongue tied, said my prayers
20 years or more
seems like yesterday

got so drunk, I took things back
things I never stole, things
I never said to anyone
I should'a killed for less
