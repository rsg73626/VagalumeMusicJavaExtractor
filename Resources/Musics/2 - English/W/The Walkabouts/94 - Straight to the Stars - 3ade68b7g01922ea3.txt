STRAIGHT TO THE STARS

don't wait any longer
not a second more
don't wait for the century to click 
ya' never can be sure 

put my hand just where you want it
been movin' much too slow
move your hand just where I want it 
and don't let go 

and if we let this devil ride
I swear he's gonna take the wheel and 
drive 

straight to the stars
can't wait any longer 
straight to the stars 
the sky is only gettin' darker now 

stars on the pavement
stars in sad eyes
stars are out for the hangin'
true stars never die 

put my hand just where you want it
been movin' much too slow
move your hand just where I want it
don't let go 

and if we let this devil ride 
I swear he's gonna take the wheel and 
drive 

straight to the stars 
can't wait any longer 
straight to the stars 
the sky is only gettin' darker now 
only gettin' darker
