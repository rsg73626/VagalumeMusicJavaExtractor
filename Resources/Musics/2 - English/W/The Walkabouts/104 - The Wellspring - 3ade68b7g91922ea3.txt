THE WELLSPRING

Knock yourself 
And knock again 
Roll it all into your hand 
And let it spin 

There's a wind blowin' hell 
From the bottom of the well 

Let it fall 
Below the belt 
Calm, cool and collected 
Who could have known 
Just how it felt 

There's a wind blowin' hell 
From the bottom of the well 

Anytime at all 
Anytime at all
