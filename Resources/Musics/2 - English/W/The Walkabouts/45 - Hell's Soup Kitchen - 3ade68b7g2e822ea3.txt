HELL'S SOUP KITCHEN

Rolled in the mud 
But I could never come clean 
Counting blessings on my middle finger 
There in the back shed 
Pricing heads to the pound
Told to shut up, I was only breathin' 

Hell's soup kitchen 
There you're listening now 
Heard you coming 
I heard you deep in the ground 

The job was dizzy on the carnival wheel 
Coins a-flipping a siren's screaming 
Told quit the ride 
And you'll go straight to the dogs 
But dogs they come home 
And dogs they listen 

Hell's soup kitchen 
There you're listening now 
Heard you coming 
I heard you deep in the ground 

And my nerves were wire 
And the shots they fell wide 
Pearls of wisdom dripping from my forehead 
Crawled in a sleeping bag 
And watched them close in 
Tires spitting all my trust to the sky 

Hell's soup kitchen 
There you're listening now 
Heard you coming 
I heard you deep in the ground
