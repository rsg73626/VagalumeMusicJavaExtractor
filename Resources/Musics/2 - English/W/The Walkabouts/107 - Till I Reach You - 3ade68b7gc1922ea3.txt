TILL I REACH YOU

I don't care how long it might last 
don't care anymore 
don't care about that 

I don't care how long it might take 
I'm still wide awake 
out walkin' late 

Till I reach you 
wait until I 
Till I reach you 
wait until I 
Till I reach you 

I don't care if it takes half the night 
or a life 
or if it's all a slow dream 
ain't no answers in me 

every slight of the hand 
every brick 
every stone 
I can face it alone 
walkin' alone 

don't care anymore
if it's short, fast, or blind
the chalk lines are drawn
I'm walkin' all night
caressed and caroused
don't care what it takes
I'm still wide awake
