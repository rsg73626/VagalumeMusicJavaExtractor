KALASHNIKOV

Kalashnikov 
Closed circuit silence 
I know I test your nerves 
When I watch the watchers 
They say the deserts bare 
The forbidden zone 
But I feel somethin' breathin' out there 
Feel it in my bones 

  When we're out there in the zone 
  Your gonna have to trust me 
  When it's just us two alone 
  Love will be our only history 

The commando squad 
Is bored and poorly fed 
Surveillance is their dog 
And it's hounding us to death 
I heard their gonna move us 
To another transit camp 
They're bulldozing the suburbs down 
Putting up a razor fence 
Bought an beat-up short wave 
From a black market trader 
But it's all just a high, shrill tone 
That's why they call it thin air 
I guess I'm getting ahead of myself 
But we can't be both inside and out 
I guess I'm getting, ahead of myself 
But we can't be both inside and out 
Inside and out, inside and out!
