HEARTLESS

This is where it starts 
This is... where it stops 
And when it finally stops 
I hope, starts right up 
Walk the glitter mile 
Past hotels of sand 
People say'n lots of things 
Ain't my job... to listen 
I don't believe 
What they say you've done 
Don't believe in anything 
Anything that lasts for long 
Everytime I change my mind... 
You say I'm heartless... but I want the same thing as you 
This is where it stops 
This is... where it starts 
And when it finally starts 
I hope it pulls right up 
Everytime I change my mind... 
You say I'm heartless... but I want the same thing as you 
Why do ya say 
They built this desert in our way? 
Open your eyes 
Watch it slowly come alive 
Somethin' new 
Changin' into somethin' new... 
Somethin' that I... saved for you 
Everytime I change my mind... everytime I change my mind 
You say I'm heartless... but I want the same thing as you 
Everytime I change my mind... everytime I change my mind 
You say I'm heartless ... but I want the same thing as you 
Hmmmmmm something new... something new... 
Something new... something new...
