LAUGHINGSTOCK

Why we can't fake it you won't ever say 
Both arms hangin' from the ball and chain 
Tongue tied and twisted from braidin' the rope 
Both arms hangin' from this faded hope 
Both arms hangin' from this faded hope 

Heard it in a whisper 
Heard it from a jailor's song 
Packed it in a suitcase 
Lost it halfway 'round the world 

Out beyond harm's way you gave a lift 
Past the shipyard and the empty pit 
And you saif that my cover was already blown 
And one too many is the one I've known 
And one too many is the one I've known 

Heard it in a whisper 
Heard it from a jailor's song 
Packed it in a suitcase 
Lost it halfway 'round the world 

Oh, I wish you wary and I wish you wise 
And then of course I wish you well 
Rode into town on the back of surprise 
And then of course I laughed like hell 
And then of course I laughed like hell 

Oh, I wish you wary and I wish you wise 
Drove into town on the back of surprise 

Oh, I wish you wary and I wish you wise 
Then of course I wish you well 
Rode into town on the back of surprise 
And then of course I laughed like hell 
And then of course I laughed like hell
