PRAYER FOR YOU

When you burn your kingdom 
Through the ashes I will come 
I know it makes no difference 
But I can't leave ya to your fun 
Usin' up your torch song gifts 
Why do you rush the end along? 
Actin' like you'll soon forget 
The end is comin' on its own 
Just this once 
I'll say a prayer for you 
Though I won't pretend to help 
Just this once 
I'll say a prayer for you 
Burnin' up the floorboards 
Burned every place you stood 
Every second chance: firewood 
Bad luck is a famous name 
For what you brought yourself 
And I'm too dumb to help 
Just this once 
I'll say a prayer for you 
Though I won't pretend I'm right 
If you ask 
I'll say a prayer for you 
They say the city don't give up 
And I believe that's true (don't you?) 
Ricochets from boom to bust 
Like most of us 
Who never cared enough... 
Just this once 
I'll say a prayer for you 
Though I won't pretend I'm right 
If you ask 
I'll say a prayer for you 
In the middle of the street 
I will stop 
I'll say a prayer for you 
If that's what you really want 
I will stop... 
I'll say a prayer for you 
In the middle of the street...
