LIFT YOUR BURDENS UP

Been a lot of rain out there 
Rainin' blind 
Summer's comin' slow ... this year 
It's rainin' blind 
If ya come back tonight 
... I'll let it ... fall away 
If ya come back tonight 
Ya better have ... the guts to stay 
Gravel's loose ... and the load is shiftin' 
Dreams are heavy ... they could use ... some ... liftin' 

Come back now ... lay all your burdens down 
And with a little luck ... I'll lift your burdens up 

Between my thoughts and my deeds 
Delusion lies 
I've forgotten everything 
We ever tried 
But if ya come back tonight 
Careful what you bring 
The sky's unwinding here 
Twisted like a busted spring 
Gravel's loose ... and the load is shiftin' 
Dreams are heavy ... they could use ... some ... liftin' 

Come back now ... and lay all your burdens down 
And with a little luck ... I'll lift your burdens up ... burdens up 

If ya need me ... you can call 
If ya need me ... I will call you 
If ya need me ... you can call 
If I need you ... I will call you 

Ain't goin' anywhere fast 
Gonna sit right here 
'Til the sky blows ... blows on past 

Come back now ... lay all your burdens down 
And with a little luck ... I'll lift your burdens up 
And when the trigger's pulled ... ya know I'll follow through 
And you can bet your luck ... I'll list your burdens up ... burdens up
