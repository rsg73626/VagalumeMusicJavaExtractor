GOLD

see my silly watch
every second lost, hmm
lost in a strange arcade
got drunk on girls night out 

If they're the good years, I don't know
what you call the hard years
If they're the good times, I don't know
what you call the hard times 

just let me know
if you can see the gold
just let me know
if can you see the gold? 

lay these knuckles bare
strip the varnish back
did we ever use to kiss?
did I ever get you off? 

If they're the good years, I don't know
what you call the hard years
If they're the good times, I don't know
what you call the hard times 

I don't see the gold in this
I don't see the gold 

the good years, I don't know
can't hang it on a wanderin' star
can't hide it in a wanderin' heart
can't blind it with a wanderin' eye 

the good years, I don't know
ah no
