END-IN-TOW

Storm it shook ya down 
From the burial ground 
There was mud on your face 
Barely lost and barely found 

And the shrunken heads around your neck 
Just replicas of thoughts 
Whose day had finally come 

You drag it fast 
You can drag it slow 
But don't drag it this way 
End-in-tow 

Walked beneath the river bridge 
And grabbed the ol' rope swing 
Said "Out there 
You'll see the bottom 
And it swallows while it sings 

And the only gold you'll find there
Are caps on these two feet." 
Dead dogs float on by 

You drag it fast 
You can drag it slow 
But don't drag it this way 
End-in-tow 

Better graves than ditches
On this we will agree
There is good earth on the west bank 
Good nails and rope and pine

You can picnic at the Cataract
Or paddle to the shore 
But you'll join the diggin' party
Just like you did before. 

You drag it fast 
You can drag it slow 
But don't drag it this way 
End-in-tow 
End-in-tow 
End-in-tow
