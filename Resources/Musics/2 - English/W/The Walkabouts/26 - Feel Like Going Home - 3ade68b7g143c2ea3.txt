FEEL LIKE GOING HOME

Lord, I feel like going home 
I've tried and I fell and I'm tired and weary 
Everything I've done is wrong 
And I feel like going home 

Lord, I tried to see you through 
But it was too much for me 
Now I'm coming home to you 
Yeah, I feel like going home 

Clouded skies are closing in 
And not a friend around to help me 
Of all the places I've been 
Lord, I feel like going home 

Lord, I feel like going home 
I've tried and I fell and I'm tired and weary 
Everything I've done is wrong 
Lord, I feel like going home 

Lord, I tried to see you through 
But it was too much for me 
Now I'm coming home to you 
Yes, I feel like going home 

Lord, I feel like going home 
I've tried and I fell and I'm tired and weary 
Everything I've done is wrong 
Lord, I feel like going home
