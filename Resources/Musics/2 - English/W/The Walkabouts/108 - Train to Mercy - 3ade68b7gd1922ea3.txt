TRAIN TO MERCY

Last time that I saw you, you were on the killing floor 
Last time that I saw you, all the tears had turned to clay 

Still I haven't panicked, come and pull the stitches tight 
No room for the panic, come and pull the stitches tight 

There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes 
There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes 

Well it moves like winter, it moves with brute force 
Well it moves like winter, leaves an empire in its course 

Heard the breakman holler: "Cannot slow it down" 
Heard the breakman holler: "Cannot slow it down" 

There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes 
There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes 

Help me poor Melissa, hide the hope behind your door 
Help me poor Melissa, put the hope into your trust 

Is the whole world big enough, for the bitter and the sweet ? 
Is the whole world big enough, for the wicked and the few ? 

There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes 
There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes 

Makes you beg, steal and borrow 
So I hope it never comes 
There is late train to Mercy 
But I hope it never comes
