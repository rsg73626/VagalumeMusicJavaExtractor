ALL FOR THIS

I come from nowhere 
I was nowhere bound

never once believed
this was my restin' ground

but somewhere between
here and that rest
I heard ya callin' my name

All for this, I have traveled
All for this, I have roamed
All for this, I have stumbled
All for this, I will carry you home

9 days of rain washed across my face
9 days of liquor, 9 days of fate
watched me blow it up to
blow it back again
but you kept callin' my name

All for this, I have traveled
All for this, I have roamed
All for this, I have stumbled
All for this, I will carry you home

comfort me, and bring no sorrow
keep on movin', gone tomorrow
I don't care
I just don't care

gone to heaven, gone to hell
they both looked the same
everywhere I go
you called my name

All for this, I have traveled
All for this, I have roamed
All for this, I have stumbled
All for this, I will carry you home

heard ya callin'
gone tomorrow
heard ya callin'
heard ya call my name

and when I find you, gone tomorrow
when I find you, I'll carry you home
