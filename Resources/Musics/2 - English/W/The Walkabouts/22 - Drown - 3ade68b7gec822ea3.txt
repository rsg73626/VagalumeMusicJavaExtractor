DROWN

somethin' of a shambles 
another wicked tangle 
still I believe that love is drawn
from the emptiest of wells 

a shadow of a mystery 
the way you can't forget me 
still I believe that love is drawn 
from the emptiest of wells 

I wanna' drown again
I wanna' drown
till my thirst is full
my lips are cool
drown 

nothin' is forgiven
nothin' reaches heaven
nothin' evens out
and nothin' crawls away 

but I believe that lightning strikes
I believe that fate has pull
I believe that love is drawn
from the emptiest of wells

the water's clear
I hope you stay
