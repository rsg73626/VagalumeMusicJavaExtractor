FEAST OR FAMINE

In a trailer park with hungry dogs 
Eat stolen bread 
With stolen credit cards 

With half a brain 
I'd torch this mess 

Have all these things 
So I don't ask for more 

Never sure it's about to happen 
Wait for sweepstakes in the mail 
What you don't know it will rip you open 

Feast or famine 
Feast or famine 

Took a leave from better sense 
A hypocrite who bit on every line 

Have no time for another laugh 
Bought a car and drove it off a cliff 

Never sure it's about to happen 
Wait for sweepstakes in the mail 
What you don't know it will rip you open 

Feast or famine 
Feast or famine
