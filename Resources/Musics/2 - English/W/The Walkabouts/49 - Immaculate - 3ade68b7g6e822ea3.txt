IMMACULATE

Said this was our town 
The joke it was on us 
We were just passin thru' 
On the way to givin' up 
Joked this was our town 
That someday we'd be thrilled 
By anything we loved 
And everything we killed 
But the biggest risk we'll ever take 
Will be to stay here in one place 
Swearin' gold is struck 
On the way to givin' up 
I try not to forget 
How close we came to it 
Ooh -- Immaculate ... ooh -- Immaculate ... 
Ain't we strange enough 
That we don't have to prove 
We know how to last 
And we know how to lose 
Gonna chase it down 
Find the truth in store 
Were we better off 
Just one stop before? 
Will there be a run of days, 
When sittin' pretty will make sense? 
When somethin' like a prayer, 
Up and pays the rent? 
I try not to forget 
How close we came to it 
Ooh -- Immaculate ... ooh -- Immaculate ... 
You're the fever that I dream 
The only dream I dream awake 
A dream the mornin' cannot shake 
You're the fever that I dream 
The only dream I dream awake 
A dream the mornin' cannot shake (the fever that I dream) 
Ooh -- Immaculate ... ooh -- Immaculate ... 
Ooh -- Immaculate ... ooh -- Immaculate ...
