YOUR HOPE SHINES

Lay my body down 
By the shallows of the creek 
You can lay my body down 
Lay me in your reach 

And when my body's down 
We'll steal the thunder from the rain 
And when my body's down 
We'll shake the dirt right from the pain 

I was going nowhere 
Nowhere very fast 
Threw my poison out the window 
But it came blowin' back 

Out along the highway 
Right through the night of crime 
Somewhere in the darkness 
Your hope shined 

Whisper wisdom's words 
You can whisper wisdom's lies 
But all of wisdom's words 
Never helped me to survive 

Days of all my arrogance 
When you were not afraid 
Threw my paycheck out the window 
You threw it all away 

Walked the devil's highway 
Across the county line 
Somewhere in the darkness 
Your hope shined 

Your hope shined, your hope shined X2
Walked the devil's highway, across the county line 
But your hope shined, your hope shined 
First light in the mornin', right through the night of crime 
Your hope shined, your hope shined 

Lay my body down 
By the shallows of the creek
