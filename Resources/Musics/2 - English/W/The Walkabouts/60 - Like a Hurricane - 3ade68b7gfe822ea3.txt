LIKE A HURRICANE

( written by Neil Young )

Once I thought I saw you in a crowded, hazy bar, 
dancing on the light from star to star 
Far across the moon beams, I know that's who you are. 
I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire. 

You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your eye. 
And I'm getting blown away. 
There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay. 
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away. 

I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream, 
and you could have been anyone to me. 
Before that moment you touched my lips, 
that perfect feeling when time just slips 
away between us and our foggy trips. 

You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your eye.
And I'm getting blown away.
There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay. 
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away. 

[Here Chris sings a verse frome "SmokeOnTheWater" by Deep Purple:] We all came down to/from Montreaux
The Lake Geneva shoreline
Some stupid with a flare-gun 
Burnt the place to the ground 

You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your eye.
And I'm getting blown away.
There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay. 
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away.
