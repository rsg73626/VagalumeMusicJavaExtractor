HARBOUR LIGHTS

Harbour lights will change your plans 
More than judge or jury can 
What a sight 
Flickerin' like prayers of grace 
How could you ever lose this place? 
What a sight 
But I'm sure I don't stand 
A ghost of a chance 
To stay here past the time, when all my checks run out 
To stay here past the time, when all my checks... run... out 
Chinese junks are driftin' in 
The foghorn blows its low warnin' 
Across the stars 
Glistening fluorescent tears 
Finally know what kept me here 
Harbour lights 
And I wonder if you 
Are makin' it through 
We all hang from a single thread and a thousand truths 
We all hang from a single thread and a thousand... truths 
Harbour lights will change your plans 
More than judge or jury can 
What a sight 
But I'm sure I don't stand 
A ghost of a chance 
To stay here past the time, when all my checks run out 
And I wonder if you 
Are makin' it through 
I wonder under which moon do you sleep tonight 
I wonder under which moon do you say... good... night
