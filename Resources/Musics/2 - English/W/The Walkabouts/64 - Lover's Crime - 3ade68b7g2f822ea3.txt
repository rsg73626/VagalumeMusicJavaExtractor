LOVER'S CRIME

Way up north, my love lies sleepin' 
Her lonely grave, beneath the pines 
How sadly I recall her memory 
She was my own true love devine 

One night I found her with another 
They did not know I was around 
In a blinded rage I drew my pistol 
I killed them both and fled that town 

For many days I wandered over 
Across the sea and desert sands 
My heart filled with grief and sadness 
I could not clense these, my blooded hands 

For many years I've been a prisoner 
My grayin' hair marks off the time 
I'm going back to my old north-lands 
To wash away my sin and pride X2
