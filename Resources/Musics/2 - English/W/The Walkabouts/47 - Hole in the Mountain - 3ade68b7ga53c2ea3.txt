HOLE IN THE MOUNTAIN

Carved your name on the numbering hill, 
Now it looks on the town with the promise to kill everything. 
We lit this valley with atomic power,
But the lights went down in the closing hour yesterday. 

And ghosty Bonny spins atop her grave. 
Sayin' we had better save what we can save. 

Oh no, 
Oh no, hole in the mountain. 

No this ain't the end of the world. 
But I'm sure you'll find it waitin' its turn close to here. 
All that's left is the salvage we brought, 
Soon we won't recognize the things that we got, close to here. 

And ghosty Bonny spins atop her grave. 
Sayin' we had better save what we can save. 

Oh no, 
Oh no, hole in the mountain. 

Send the storm kings across the flat. 
Take it back while there's somethin' to take back. 
Shake the cans 'til the crows go flyin'. 
Bedlam's breakin' but that won't stop us from tryin'. 

Hole in the mountain. 
Oh no, 
Oh no, hole in the mountain.
