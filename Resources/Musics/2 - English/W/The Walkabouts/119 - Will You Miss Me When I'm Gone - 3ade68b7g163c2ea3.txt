WILL YOU MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE

When death shall close these eyelids 
And this heart shall cease to beat 
And they lay me down to rest 
In some flowery-bound retreat 

Will you miss, miss me, when I'm gone 
Will you miss, miss me, miss me when I'm gone X2
Will you miss when I'm gone 

Perhaps you'll plant a flower 
On my poor unworthy grave 
And come sit alone beside me 
When the roses nod and wave 

Will you miss, miss me, when I'm gone 
Will you miss, miss me, miss me when I'm gone X2
Will you miss when I'm gone 

One sweet thought my soul shall cherish 
Till this fleeting life has flown 
This sweet thought will cheer when dying 
You will miss me when I'm gone 

Will you miss, miss me, when I'm gone 
Will you miss, miss me, miss me when I'm gone X2
Will you miss when I'm gone
