JUMPING OFF

 Dressed in jealous clothes 
She drove to the black hole 
Out past to where the roads turn into sand 
No crmies worth a dime 
'Less you look it in the eye 

And she drove 
And she drove 
Past the debts that he owed 
Past the ends she can't meet 

Jumping off is the air that I breathe 
Jumping off is the air that I breathe 
And I should have swindled And I should have lied 
And I should have jumped 
When the chance was mine 

Tied up in your sleep 
Like a tiger with no teeth 
Can't confess to things you've never done 
Soup left on the stove 
And the cellar barred and closed 

And she drove 
And she drove 
Past the debts that he owed 
Past the ends she can't keep 
Jumping off is the air that I breathe 
Jumping off is the air that I breathe 
And I should have swindled 
And I should have lied 
And I should have jumped 
When the chance was mine 

Hold your horses 
And hold your britches 
And hold the handle 
on you suspicious drink 
Drink to your health 
Drink to your wealth 
Drink if you think it will make a difference 

And hold your britches 
And hold the handle 
on you suspicious drink 
Drink to your health 
Drink to your wealth 
Drink if you think it makes a difference
