FEELING NO PAIN

Will you crash the engine of our ruin?
Who'll spill the flat cars of our shame?

I'm beat up tired from always doin',
What I shoulda done in the first place.

You can call in sick, no need to fear the morning.
You will drink by numbers, I will drink by faith.
The stairs are crashin', so is all the danger.
Shoulda took a breath, but I's too drunk to wait.

Can you still prescribe, 
The remedies and lies, 
'Til we feel no pain? 
'Til we all have risen.X2

Porchlights shattered, but the veins still glow here.
Met you in a bar, out by the switchin' yard.
My best attempts, can only knock you down here.
You should wear this badge, or wear nothin' at all.

Can we reconcile,
The bottom of the pile,
'Til the poison tastes good? 
'Til we all have risen.
'Til we all have risen.

Can you help explain, 
The senseless and the vain,
'Til the vial's empty?
Can you still prescribe, 
The remedies and lies, 
'Til we feel no pain? 
'Til we all have risen.X4

Will you crash the engine of our ruin?
Will you give me up to feel no pain?
