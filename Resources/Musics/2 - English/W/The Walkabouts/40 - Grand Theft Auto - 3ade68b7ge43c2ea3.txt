GRAND THEFT AUTO

In this town 
The blood will make you rich 
Yeah, in this town 
The blood will make you rich 

In this town 
I will do you one better 
I'll change the truth 
When I change the weather 

In this town 
The blood will make you rich 

And when you're down 
You can buy the Jesus pose 
'Cause in this town 
All roads lead to this 

And when you're down 
I will kill it again 
I'll give ya something 
To forget about him 

In this town 
All roads lead to this 

And come tonight, yeah come tonight 
We'll take a ride 
And come tonight, yeah come tonight 
We'll see the lights 

You will lead and I will follow 
You will lead me, down to the hollow 
You will lead me down 
Grand theft auto 
You will lead me down 

In this town 
We have got the Midas touch 
Yeah in this town 
The gold will make you blush 
Some of it's cooling 
And some of it's glitters 
All of it's cold 
And it gives me the shivers 

In this town we've got the Midas touch 

And come tonight, yeah come tonight 
We'll take a ride 
And come tonight, yeah come tonight 
We'll see the lights 

You will lead and I will follow 
You will lead me, down to the hollow 
You will lead me down 
Grand theft auto 
You will lead me down
