SHELTER FOR AN EVENING

Howling like a banshee in the middle of the night 
Don't you know it's me at your back door 
I'm wounded and scared with no place to go 
Won't you give me home for the night 

Shelter for an evening, shelter for the rain 
Just for tonight, you'll never see me again 
I'm wounded, oh baby, cant you see? 
I got no one to blame but me 

And I know this shit is killin' me 
I can't stop, no, I can't stop 
And it's getting to the point where I don't care 
Just who or what you're sleeping with 

I'm wounded and scared with no place to go 
Won't you give me home for the night 

Shelter for an evening, shelter for the rain 
Just for tonight, you'll never see me again 
I'm wounded, oh baby, cant you see? 
I got no one to blame but me 
I got no one to blame but me 
I got no one to blame . . . . but me
