GLAD NATION'S DEATH SONG

These are the ghosts that I half believed 
Guns & liquor & the carnival freak 
But then one day the whole world shook 
And I got arrested for stealin' a look 

And the glad nation's death song sings X2
And I wanna hear you sing 
And I wanna hear you . . . . hear you sing 

Well they dragged me down to the deptor's jail 
Where no one cried 'cause the drinks were free 
And there I met you, you were passin' the hat 
Sayin' give to the memory of a long gone dream 

And the glad nation's death song sings X2
And I wanna hear you sing 
And I wanna hear you . . . . hear you sing 

This is the sound of one hand clappin' 
This is the sound of one man laughin' 
Sayin' we are lucky, yeah lucky is us 
'Cause behind these bars we've been stuck 

And the glad nation's death song sings X4
And I wanna hear you sing 
And I wanna hear you . . . . hear you sing
