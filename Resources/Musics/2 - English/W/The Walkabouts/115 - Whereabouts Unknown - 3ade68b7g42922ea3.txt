WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

Cross your heart gently 
The best days are with us 
Don't be dark-hearted 
You'll just disappear 

Trust you won't stumble 
I trust you won't walk blind 
Trust you won't miss 
What has never been found 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown 
(leave it alone) 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown 
(leave it alone) 

Fortune it tells you 
It's time for the good news 
Came on the porch 
And poured gasoline down 

Time for the razing 
The great leap fast-forward 
How can I miss you? 
You never were found. 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown 
(leave it alone) 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown

Love is the crank on a black-water well 
Don't turn for pleasure 
It's turning deeper (?)
Know you'd believe it if we ever met 
Know you'll believe it when you're finally found 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown 
(leave it alone) 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown

Cross your heart gently 
The best days are with us 
Don't swim black water 
You'll just disappear 

Love is the crank on a black-water well 
Don't turn for pleasure 
It's turning deeper (?)
Know you'd believe it if we ever met 
Know you'll believe it when you're finally found 

Whereabouts 
(no compass, no bearing) 
Whereabouts unknown 
(leave it alone) 

Whereabouts
