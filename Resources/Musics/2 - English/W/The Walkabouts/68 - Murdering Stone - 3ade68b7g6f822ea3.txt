MURDERING STONE

Man came down from the field 
A lonely horseman 
Headin' back to the stable 
Said he was sorry 
But his cain was not able 
To save us all from ourselves 

Man sees the blood on every door 
And hears the laughter 
In the good people's hearts 
Their pocket's empty 
And their coats ripped apart 
And the man makes a promise to the town 

I wanna give you my murdering stone 
Give you my murdering stone 

Happy-go-lucky's back in town 
Happy-go-lucky's says he's fit to be tied 
Now that his hands have done 
A sin worse than pride 
And the man makes a promise to us all 

I wanna give you my murdering stone 
Give you my murdering stone 

Won't you take my X2
I wanna give you my murdering stone 

My hands are heavy now that all the guns are home 
Take my murdering stone 

And I wanna give you my murdering stone 
Please take my murdering X2
Please take my murdering stone
