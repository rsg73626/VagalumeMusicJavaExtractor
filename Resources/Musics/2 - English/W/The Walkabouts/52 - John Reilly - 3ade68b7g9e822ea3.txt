JOHN REILLY

Fair young maiden 
All in the garden 
Strange young man 
Passed her by 
Said: "Fair maid 
Will you marry me?" 
This, then, sir, 
Was her reply 

"Oh no, kind sir 
I canot marry thee 
For my beloved 
Who sails out on the sea 
He's been gone 
For seven years 
And still no man 
Shall marry me 

Well if he's in 
Some battle salin 
Well I will die 
When the moon [ ? ] 
Or if he's drowned 
In the dark salt sea 
I'll be true 
To his memory." 

He picked her up 
All in his arms 
And kisses gave her 
One, two and three 
Said: "Weep no more 
My own dear true love 
I am your love 
Lost John Reilly" 

Said: "Weep no more 
My own dear true love 
I am your love 
Lost John Reilly"
