TREMBLE (GOES THE NIGHT)

Gettin' stupid ... crooked feet 
A pinball on ... Scott Walker Street 
Gettin' stupid ... in a bar 
Not goin' home ... til the band plays "Superstar" 
Everything's on the edge of everything else 
You're hittin' a stride, that cannot be stopped 
People been callin' all the way from Florida 
Ya said, you're going down there, for a week or more 

Tremble goes ... Tremble goes the night 
Tremble goes ... Tremble goes the night 

Gettin stupid ... dancin' veins 
Night rain on ... the Greyhound sign 
Gettin' stupid ... flashlight face 
Strangers got ... the clearest eyes 
Nothin's worth envy, but I can't help myself 
Go find your glory, ya don't need my help 
When it explodes, ya better line up to bet 
The dead don't have birthdays, they just forget 

Tremble goes ... Tremble goes the night 
Tremble goes ... Tremble goes the night 

Shadows sparkle ... streetcars burn 
All of God's drunks ... we wait our turn 
So you're leavin' ... write it on a cake 
I'll take a piece ... and I'll join the wait 
When you get back, we'll find a heart and soul chapel 
See if there's anything, left to unravel 
Now go drop this five, in the band's tip jar 
I'm not goin' home ... til the band plays "Superstar" ("Superstar") 
Tremble goes ... Tremble goes the night 
Tremble goes ... Tremble goes the night
