DESERT SKIES

blacklight fades
headlights switched off
the engine burns
as we're rollin' to a stop 

let's get out here
lie down in the middle of road
ain't no cars comin' 

only stars
and stars alone
the city at our backs 
did you really think that it would last? 

heaven's trace
a trail of starlight gone 
the city best forgotten 

did the wind hit you in the eye?
or were you just about to cry?
desert skies......
this ain't the place to turn around
never even said goodbye
desert skies...... 

a day so hot it seemed
like the rocks could sing
the sky so flat it seemed there was
nothin' in the wings 

scar on your lip
a story far too long to tell
the story best forgotten 

our party in hell's been cancelled 
due to fire and thick smoke 
torched up by its own success 
do ya' wish that we had never spoke? 

yours and yours alone 
mine everywhere thrown 
yours alone 

did the wind hit you in the eye? 
or were you just about to cry?
desert skies...... 

all the stars are shaped like tears 
tears are satellites
desert skies......
