WHISPER

Baby, baby 
  Foolish baby 
  Wipe your foolish blame 
  Crazy, crazy 
  Crazy, baby 
  Wipe your foolish blame 

I've been thinking bout this all week 
How were lost on a losing streak 
Armed guards at the last mini-mart 
Shootin' it wide of the mark 
Roadblocks goin' up in the dark 
Hi-rise towers take a tightrope walk 

  Truths a whisper 
  A shaky whisper 
  chase it, then it's wrong 
  Time is panic 
  Hushed and rankled 
  You feel it, then it's gone 

They take us in for identity checks 
They've been roundin' up all their best bets 
The refineries flare in the night 
Roman candles from some other life 
What's best, is somewhere in your hands 
My best laid plans, your hands, 
My best laid plans, your hands 
Your hands, my best laid plans. 
Shout! Got nothing to show for this 
Shout! Where is the now? 
Where are the next three minutes? 
Shout! Got nothin' to show for this 
Shout!
