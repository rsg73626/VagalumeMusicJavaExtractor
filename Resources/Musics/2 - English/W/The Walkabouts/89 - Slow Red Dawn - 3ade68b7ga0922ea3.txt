SLOW RED DAWN

We need a better idea, here quick 
Before the sun's beatin' down on our necks 
We need a better idea 
Watch us speed, to the end of the world 
Promise all, that we've already heard 
And still we're nowhere 
I don't care to know all the details 
How you left him to shout down the stairs 
I don't care to know 
Slow Red Dawn is gonna come 
Slow Red Dawn is comin' on 
Slow Red Dawn 
Do you see that thin strip of light there? 
On the skyline, it seems unaware 
That we haven't slept yet 
But as long as we still laugh for keeps 
And you swear you were dyin' to leave 
There's no reason to sleep 
Slow Red Dawn is gonna come 
Slow Red Dawn is comin' on 
Slow Red Dawn 
Slow Red Dawn is gonna come 
Slow Red Dawn is comin' on 
Slow Red Dawn 
Do ya see that light there? 
On the skyline unaware 
Do ya see that light there? 
Comin' on 
Are we gonna let it flag? 
I think we got it in the bag 
Do ya see the light there? 
Comin' on
