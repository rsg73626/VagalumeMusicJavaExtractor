POOR SIDE OF TOWN

How can you tell me how much you miss me 
When the last time I saw you, you wouldn't even kiss me 
The rich guy you're seein' must have put you down 
So welcome back, baby, to the poor side of town 

To him you ain't nothin' but a play-thing 
Not much more than an overnight-thing 
To me you're the greatest that I've ever found 
And it's hard to find nice things on the poor side of town 

I can't blame you for trying 
I'm trying to make it true 
I got one kind of [ ? ] 
I can't make it without you 

So tell me, are you gonna stay now? 
Would you stand by me, all the way now? 
With you by my side, they can't keep us down 
Together we can make it from the poor side of town 
Together we can make it from the poor side of town 
So welcome back, baby, to the poor side of town
