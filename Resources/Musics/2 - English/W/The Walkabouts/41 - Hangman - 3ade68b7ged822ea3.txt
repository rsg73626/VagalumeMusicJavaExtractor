HANGMAN

Hangman take these heads from me 
And swing 'em from your money tree 
Hear me laughing in my steps 
These heads are yours, they're yours to keep 

Please don't skip the last details 
Rewards are yours beyond the pale 
And if you slip, just look around 
Your wrists are shackled to the crowd 

Hangman is your passenger 
Hangman is your passenger 
Hangman is your passenger 
The hangman is your passenger tonight 

Stretching the rope with one of his hands 
And in one of his hands he holds a bible 
Looks at the road with one of his eyes 
And with one of his eyes he will watch you driving 

Hangman is your passenger 
The hangman is your passenger tonight 

Hangman take these heads from me 
And swing 'em from your money tree 
Wagered on the judgement call 
But every time you lost it all
