STIR THE ASHES

All dressed up for the day of the dead 
I have been waiting 
It's coming soon enough 

The doors are open and the prowlers have all fled 
So tired of waiting 
So tired of hanging tough 

Stir the ashes round 
Underneath my shoes 
Just stir the ashes round 
Make 'em dizzy, in the mud 
Make 'em dizzy 
Round and round and round 

Come and sit by the lonesome potter's grave 
Come and pull the weeds 
Come and write your name 

Sitting here the sirens seem so far away 
They're back in timber town 
Three cheers for timber town 

Stir the ashes round 
Underneath my shoes 
Just stir the ashes round 
Make 'em dizzy, in the mud 
Make 'em dizzy 
Round and round and round 

Pull me right out of the dark 
My vision's never been this true 
The spoils have been crudely cut 
The balance has been lost for good 
Stir the ashes round
