LET'S BURN DOWN THE CORNFIELD

Let's burn down the cornfield 
Let's burn down the cornfield 
We can listen to it burn 

We'll hide behind the oak tree 
Hide behind the oak tree 
Stay out of danger 'til I return 

Oh, it's so good 
On a cold night 
To have the fire burning bold and bright 

You hide behind the oak tree 
Hide behind the oak tree 
Stay out of danger 'til I return 

Let's burn down the cornfield 
Let's burn down the cornfield 
We'll make love while it burns 
We'll make love while it burns 

We'll make love while it burns
