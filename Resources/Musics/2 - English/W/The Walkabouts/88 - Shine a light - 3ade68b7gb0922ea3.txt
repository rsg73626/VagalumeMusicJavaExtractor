SHINE A LIGHT

( written by Jagger/Richards )

Saw you stretched out in Room Ten O Nine 
with a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye.
Couldn't see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love.
Berber jew'lry jangling down the street,
make you shut your eyes at ev'ry woman that you meet.
Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
make every song [you sing] your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
warm like the evening sun.

well, you're in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
and your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn.
Just seemed too many flies on you, I just can't brush them off.
Angels beating all their wings in time,
with smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes.
Thought I heard on sigh for you,
come on up, come on up, now, come on up now.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
make every song [you sing] your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
warm like the evening sun.
