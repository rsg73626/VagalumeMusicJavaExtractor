HIGHTIMES

hightimes, undermine
tell me somethin' I don't know 

hightimes, can chase em 'til your blind
tell me somethin' I don't know 

now you're lyin' next to me
the one place that you shoulda' stayed
lyin' next to me 

now you're lyin' next to me
the place I said you'd always be
hightimes, gone away 

let go
hit it on the money
let it go, let it go, let it go
let go
hit it closer than you wanted
let it go, let it go, let it go 

them hightimes forgave
rips and tears 
them hightimes forgave
but I don't care
hightimes have strayed
them hightimes have strayed 

we drove to the top of castle hill 
the lights of the town below 

we drove, you were almost still
the lights of the town below 

you said things look twice as small 
when you have been livin' tall
things look twice as small 

you said things look twice as far
when you have been gone so long
things look twice as far 

them hightimes forgave, but look at you
now
