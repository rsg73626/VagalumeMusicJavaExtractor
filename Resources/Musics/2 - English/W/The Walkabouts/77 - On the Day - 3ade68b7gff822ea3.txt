ON THE DAY

behind the bric and brac
there will be no lookin' back 

and between hell and hello
there will be no lettin' go
no there won't 

and you can't be serious
no you can't
you won't really do him in
well you might 

hey this all seems like a joke
yes it does, but it's not
where I laugh before you've spoke 
stuttered words 
poisoned love 

And the trumpets lean and barren 
and the sirens shrill and darin'

on the day that I...... 

and your people all will say
what they want, what they will

and the tower bells will rage
from the top of the hill 

and the crows they all will crow
what they crow
what they know
and the crows they all will crow
"gotta go" 
"gotta go" 

And the trumpets lean and barren
and the sirens shrill and darin'
on the day that I.....

the day that I stop carin'
