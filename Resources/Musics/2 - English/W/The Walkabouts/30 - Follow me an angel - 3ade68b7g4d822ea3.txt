FOLLOW ME AN ANGEL

The city's shiverin' 
Shivers in the heat 
That we call summertime 
And I'm deliverin' 
The one piece of the puzzle 
That you could not find 

Follow me an angel 
Follow every fool I can tonight 
Follow me an angel 
From the rooftops 
These streets 
Don't seem so bright 

The clocks have lost their hands 
The clouds take off their shirts 
And show their scars to me 
And we're out kickin cans 
Chasin' sirens 
Past the gate ... of your driveway 
Now here's the teeth to the city 
The keys to your wings 
The promise that I won't say no 
Though we ain't lookin' pretty 
There's some places open late
Where we can go 

Follow me an angel 
Follow every fucked-up fool tonight 
Follow me an angel 
From the rooftops 
These streets don't seem so bright
