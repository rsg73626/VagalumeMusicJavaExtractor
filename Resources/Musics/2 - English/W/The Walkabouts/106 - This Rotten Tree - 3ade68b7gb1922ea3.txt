THIS ROTTEN TREE

Liars left their roost last night 
I heard it from some talkshow host 
Fangs and venom working hard 
In simulcast from coast to coast 

Hey ho, 'round we go 
This rotten tree will never grow 
Hey ho, 'round we go 
This rotten tree will never grow 

Dogs and colonels laugh in packs 
And take us for the fools we've been 
Some patriots got drunk and begged 
To all go bottoms up 

Hey ho, 'round we go 
This rotten tree will never grow 
Hey ho, 'round we go 
This rotten tree will never grow 

This rotten tree will never grow 
This rotten tree . . . 
This rotten tree . . . 
This rotten tree will never grow
