NIGHTDRIVE

Check the main road one more time.
Check the main road but I'm sure that you will find. 

It is late and closin' down.
There are lights out there but they do not seem close. 

Take these long knives for the ride.
One for every day we missed.
Cut it deep, then cut it wide.
'Til the blood runs clear.
On the night drive.

Lizards blinded by the center line.
Lava black, let mystery take its own sweet time.

Grab the antenna and hold it tight.
Turn it 'round til you find somethin' we can sing.

Take these long knives for the ride.
One for every day we missed.
Cut it deep, then cut it wide.
'Til the blood runs clear.
On the night drive.X2

If we don't move, then we can never scar.
If we don't regret, it means we never pushed this far.
Cut it deep, then cut it wide.
'Til the blood runs clear.
On the night drive....
