MAN FROM RENO

If I could loose
If you could choose
For this next dance you might choose me
I ainÂ´t no pussy with the blues
Just step out on the floor and see

CanÂ´t follow a man from Reno
Follow a man from Zurich
Follow a man from Italy
CanÂ´t follow a man with brain grass
Follow his long long eye gas
Follow a man from Munich 

Running out of luck
Running out of luck
In the midnight

Zodiac killers drain their hands and wipe away
The shadows from the walls
Neighbours all say heÂ´s got no friends
His friends all say you got him by the balls

Look up you might even shred the stars
Look up might even stop the scars

Zodiac killer needs that crack he wants you back
HeÂ´s waiting in the bars
Zodiac killer needs that crack he wants you back
HeÂ´s waiting in the bars

CanÂ´t follow a man from Reno 
Follow a man from Izmir
Follow a man from Wyoming
Follow this waving heather
Follow the angry weather
A man from Sarajevo

Running out of luck
Running out of luck
In the midnight

Zodiac killer drains his hands and wipes away
The shadows from the walls
Look up you might even shred the stars
Look up might even stop the scars
Zodiac killer needs that crack he wants you back
HeÂ´s waiting in the bars

In the midnight
Waiting in the bars
