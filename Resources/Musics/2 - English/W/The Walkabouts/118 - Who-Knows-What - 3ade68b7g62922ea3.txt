WHO-KNOWS-WHAT

I waited all day 
And it seemed like one day too many 

To find out who knows what 
And why all the gallons are hanging 

Deadmen are sneaking 
Over thr hills 
Something forgotten 
Is going on there still 

I waited all day 
and still it seemed like one day too many 

Down in the basement 
With gunfire closer than distant 

And upstairs the band 
Played a cynical waltz 

The whole world a blamin' 
When it's everyone's fault 

Who knows what 
Who knows what 

Tell me what kind of 
Is at the end of the world who knows what 

What kind of [?] is at the end of the world who knows what
