POLLY

If the wild-bird could speak 
He'd tell of places you have been 
He's been in my dreams 
And he knows all the ways of the winds 

Polly, come home again 
Spread your wings to the wind 
I fell much of the pain 
As it begins 

Dreams cover much time 
Still they leve blind the will to begin 
I searched for you there 
And now look for you within 

Polly, come home again 
Spread your wings to the wind 
I fell much of the pain 
As it begins 

Polly, come home again 
Spread your wings to the wind 
I fell much of the pain 
As it begins
