BREAK IT DOWN GENTLY

It soon appears 
Long rented shores 
Too big to name 
And second to none 

Save horses' hair 
In pockets deep 
Remember skies 
Second to none 

Black rain 
Black rain will come 
Black rain 
Black rain will come 

Word to the wise 
Don't you sit on this fence 
Electric and live 
With evangelistic zeal 

Spin doctors gave you 
All those remedies to choose 
So you'd be the weathervane 
For clouds that never move 

Black rain 
Black rain will come 
Black rain 
Black rain will come 

To break it down gently 
To wash it down slow 
Goin' straight to the bottom 
With a mind . . . . of it's own 

Black rain, Black rain, Black rain will come X3 
Black rain will come
