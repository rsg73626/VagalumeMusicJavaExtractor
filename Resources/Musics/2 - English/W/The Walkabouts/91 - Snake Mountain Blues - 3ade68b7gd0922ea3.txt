SNAKE MOUNTAIN BLUES

Mr. ten dollar man 
Let me tell you where you're bound 
When you drink your green liquor 
Lord, you'll roll to the ground 

But you come around here 
With your money in your hand 
Tasted my woman 
You'll die where you stand 

Snake Mountain's gonna crumble 
Lord, and fall from the sky 
'Til that woman of mine 
Keeps on telling her lies 

If I'd die Lord, she'd weep 
And she'd weep and she'd mourne 
As soon as I was buried 
Forget I been born 

Well my daddy, he rides on a long holy train 
And the first winds of winter 
Well, I'll see him again 

And it's goodbye to that yellow-headed misery I've known 
Snake Mountain is callin' 
Is callin' me home 

Got the Snake Mountain blues X4

Got the Snake Mountain blues X4

*[One verse of the original is left out. 
It goes something like this: 

Well the Snake Mountain blues 
Have got me down low 
I could die in the morning 
And no one would know 
Well, my woman comes 'round 
My body she'd found 
Go down to Dundee 
(And) Have her a time]
