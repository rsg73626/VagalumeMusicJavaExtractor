MR. CLANCY

If you're ready and the creek don't rise
If you're ready with the furnace full 
Trees were shakin' and the break was good
Finally lost him in the neck of the woods
If you're ready and the creek don't rise

Mr. Clancy was a dog of prey
Took the decent and the laughin' sheep
Mr. Clancy took his hand to you
But I'm not waiting just to prove it's true
If you're ready and the creek don't rise

There's something you must do
With head turned off and you knew (?)

If you're ready and the creek don't rise
