DRAG THIS RIVER

Quick, burn it down to the wick 
Burn it down to the heart 
So the ending can start 

Here, behind the riverhaus door 
With an unloaded gun 
And an unsettled score 

Well I'll never drag this river 
I'll never drag this river X2
I'll never drag this river down 

You, nothin' comes to you slow 
Nothin' comes to you hard 
Though you beg like you're hard 

And me, don't shake the barrel ar me 
And don't treat idle threats 
Like you treat all your friends 

Well I'll never drag this river 
I'll never drag this river X2
I'll never drag this river down 

And if you walk out that door 
Don't come back 
Because there'll be no door 

And if you walk out that door 
Silence greets you 
Silence, will be yours 

I hear ya callin' from a long distant shore 
But you won't come back, [well / 'cause] you can't come back 

The water's risin' and the levee is not sure 
And you won't be found, no you can't be found 

Drag this river down
