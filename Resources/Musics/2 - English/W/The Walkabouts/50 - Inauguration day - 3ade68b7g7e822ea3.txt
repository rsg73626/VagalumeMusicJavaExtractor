INAUGURATION DAY

I'm up to my neck 
In the mud of Inauguration day 

They say it's one in fifty years 
That storm, that blew my dog away 

And they say the road has been washed out 
From Rockport to Concrete 
And all the trees are falling down 
And now, heaven's at my feet 

My wishes do my beggin' for me 
And like a beggar they do [learn / laugh] 

Frozen fingers touch my face 
They tie a blindfold 'round my eyes 

And I'm stuck at this roadblock 
Chasing fog and smoke 
I guess the price of doing thhat was just 
Another killing joke 

Wash me down 
Wash me down 

Sing for me now 
Sing for me now 

Wash me from the hillside 
And wash me from the dirt 
Wash me from your worldly claims 
And wash me, wash me from your hurt 

'Cause I'm up to my neck 
In the mud of Inauguration day
