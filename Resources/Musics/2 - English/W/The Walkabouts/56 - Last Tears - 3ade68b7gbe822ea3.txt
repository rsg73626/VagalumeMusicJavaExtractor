LAST TEARS

These are your last tears for the century 
don't cry them for me 

these are your last tears, before the
party starts
don't throw them away 

use em' wisely, use em' large
use em' soft, and use em' hard 

once were flush but now we're skint as
bone
can ill-afford to waste our tears alone 

these are our last tears for this century 
don't blame them on me 

this is our first, and surely, our last 
attempt 
to earn what we've spent 

set 'em up, and knock 'em back
lost in the stars, lost in the scraps 

next century will never ask you why
cares not if you've come, or if you cried 

last tears of the century
they keep on comin' 

All the revolutions, they've been here and gone
missed everyone 

except the one that we have, yet begun
missed everyone 

spin in circles, till we're stung
by every heart, and every gun 

Put the future behind us, until we see today
happiness can't buy ya' money, till we see today 

and the only thing that's left to do
is to see that they don't cover you .....
last tears of the century
