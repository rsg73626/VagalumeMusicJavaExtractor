FOREVER GONE

Streaks of light 
On the graveyard walk 
Your bright star was crashin' 
Crashin' the dark 
Dreamed of a cold night 
To freeze it in place 
Dreamed of ship bells and thunder 
Ringin' us under 
Dreamed all the way home 
That you'd never go 
Talked up and down it 
Mornin', noon and night 
Alone in the optimists chair 
Said our instincts were right 
But now I know the clean choice 
Was the worst choice of all 
I'd rather feel guilt 
Than this desert inside 
I'd rather steal wicked 
Than lay down in pride 
Gone forever 
Forever gone 
Made a mess of this town 
But that's what we always do 
Throwin' glass to the floor 
Now it's cuttin' right through 
More than a year's time 
'Til ya give up the scheme 
My wood matches meltin' 
The ghosts from your wedding ring 
Never trusted fate 
But I wish that I had 
Fate is what answered 
Your slow cry for help 
Fate was your motive 
Your fate was yourself 
Gone forever 
Forever gone 
Made a mess of this town 
But that's what we always do 
Throwin' glass to the floor 
Now it's cuttin' right through 
Gone forever 
Forever gone 
I'd rather feel guilt 
Than this desert inside 
I'd rather steal wicked 
Than lay down in pride 
Seems like a long time... oooh!
