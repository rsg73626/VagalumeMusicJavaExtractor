MEDICINE HAT

Steal it from the yard
Medicine hat she wore
Mother's protection
Protection from the open sun
What is gone was never here
And what is here is second-hand

Trust in only shadows
'Cause they never know they're wrong
Steal it from the yard
Medicine hat she wore
What is gone was never here
And what is here is second-hand

Medicine Hat
Medicine Hat

You could all but disappear
At the drunk electric show
Just fall into the whirlpool
That's spinning on the Grange Hall floor
Then go outside and burn the fence
That splits into the coal-black sky

Got more strength than weakness
Got the strength to tell this lie.
You could all but disappear
At the drunk electric show.
