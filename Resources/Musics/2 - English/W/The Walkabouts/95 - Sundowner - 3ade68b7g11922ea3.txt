SUNDOWNER

Deaf as a fence post 
Alone on a winter's night 
I'm drunk as a racehorse 
But I'll never fade outta sight 

There's a wild below me 
A wild up there in the stars 
There's a history behind me 
A child gone cold in my arms 

Tell George and Tammy 
I'm ripe for the taking these days 
It's a good year for roses 
(And) a bad year for runnin' in place 

But if they don't believe me 
I'll do what I always have done 
I won't be the sundowner 
No I'll never cheat on the sun 

'Cause when the sun comes up 
And the moon is gone 
To the bridge I go 
To the bridge I run 

And when I reach the edge 
Onto the bridge I crawl 
And when I find you my friend 
From the bridge I fall 

This is the last place 
That I've ever been, ever been 
It's the last best place 
That I've ever been, ever been 

And in spite of my weakness 
And all my desires to win 
I won't be the sundowner 
Tomorrow I'll leave here again 

'Cause when the sun comes up 
And I need a friend 
To the bridge I run 
When I need a friend 

And when I meet the edge 
Onto the bridge I crawl 
And when I find you my friend 
It's from the bridge I fall
