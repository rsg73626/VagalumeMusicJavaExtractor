ON THE BEACH

( written by Neil Young )

The world is turning, I hope it don't turn away 
The world is turning, I hope it don't turn away 
All my pictures are falling 
From the wall where I placed them yesterday 
The world is turning, I hope it don't turn away 

I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day 
I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day 
Though my problems are meaningless 
That don't make them go away 
I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day 

I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone 
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone 
Now I'm living out here on the beach 
But those seagulls are still out of rach 
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone 

Get outta town, I think I'll get outta town 
Get outta town, I think I'll get outta town 
I head for the stick [mumble mumble mumble] 
I follow a road I don't know where it goes 
Get outta town, I think I'll get outta town 

Cos the world is turning, I hope it don't turn away
