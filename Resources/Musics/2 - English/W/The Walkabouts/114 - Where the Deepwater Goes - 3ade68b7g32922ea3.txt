WHERE THE DEEPWATER GOES

Into the heart of this old sunken ship 
A white knuckle journey you won't soon forget 

Out where the deepwater goes 

Into the veins of this old lizard skin 
To Tierra Del Fuego and then back again 

That's where the deepwater goes 
That's where the deepwater goes 

Soon you will fathom how deep it goes down 
And the bottom's a good place to start 
Our bottle is empty 
The searchlight is off 
Oh, the bottom's a good place to start 

Out of the tumbler and into the flame 
Out from the shadows where no one gets blamed 

That's where the deepwater goes 
That's where the deepwater goes 

It's all muddy ground there with no place to build 
But the deepwater never complains 
Our slow boat to China will get slower still 
But the deepwater never complains 
That's where the deepwater goes 
And it goes
