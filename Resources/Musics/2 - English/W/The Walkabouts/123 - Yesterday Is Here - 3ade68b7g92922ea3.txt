YESTERDAY IS HERE

( written by Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan )

If you want money in your pocket 
And a top hat on your head 
A hot meal on your table 
And a blanket on your bed 

Well today is grey skies 
Tomorrow is tears 
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here 

I'm going to New York City 
And I'm leaving on a train 
And if you want to stay behind and wait 
Til I come back again 

Well today is grey skies 
And tomorrow is tears 
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here

If you want to go
Where the rainbows end
You'll have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true
Baby up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie

Well the road's out before me
The moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember 
As I disappear tonight 

Today is grey skies 
Tomorrow is tears 
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here
