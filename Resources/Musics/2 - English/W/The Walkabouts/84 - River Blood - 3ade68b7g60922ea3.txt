RIVER BLOOD

Highwater is everywhere, highwater is telling me to go 
There's poison in the course it runs, there's ashes from the factory on the hill 

Watch it all fall down 
From the mountain to the ground 
Watch it all say no 
River Blood 
Oh, River Blood 
I've always found that river 

Test my grip and then I'm sure you will believe that I cannot let go 
I live on fruit I have preserved in mason jars beneath the basement floor 

Watch it all fall down 
From the mountain to the ground 
Watch it all say no 
River Blood 
Oh, River Blood 
I've always found that river 

These walls are covered in black bullet holes and each one has a christian name 
One's my father, one's my son, I stick my fingers in to prove they're real 

Watch it all fall down 
From the mountain to the ground 
Watch it all say no 
River Blood 
Oh, River Blood 
I've always found that river
