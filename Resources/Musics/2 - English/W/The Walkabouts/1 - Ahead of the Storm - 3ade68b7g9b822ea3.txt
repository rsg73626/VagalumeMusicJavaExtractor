AHEAD OF THE STORM

Gotta trust my name
No fork in my tongue
Gotta trust my name

Never saw it blow
Never saw it blow
The clouds rained money
Never saw it blow
The clouds rained money
Never saw it blow

Shoulda locked my jaw
The words are devils
Shoulda locked my jaw

It wasn't what I saw
It wasn't what I saw
Their barrels pointing
Wasn't what I saw
Their barrels pointing
Wasn't what I saw

Ahead of the storm
Is where I belong
Ahead of the storm
With thunder laughing

Gotta trust my name
But it can't be done
Gotta trust my name
But it can't be done

The clouds rained money
Never saw it blow
The clouds rained money
Never saw it blow

Ahead of the storm
Is where I belong
Ahead of the storm
With thunder laughing
On and on and on...
