WHISKEY XXX

Whiskey hold me well 
And never let me spill 
From the blind man's bluff 
Across the frozen lake 

Oh chance me, chance me not, 
With the last chance that you've got 
Keep it rising like the river 
And sinking with my fear 

Somewhere out of these 
Somewhere out of these woods 
Somewhere out of these 
Somewhere out of these woods 

Whiskey hold me well 
Ain't nothing you can't kill 
Now the pain is just forgiveness 
In a borrowed suit of clothes 

Agree to disbelieve 
Leave the thinking for the thieves 
Left my empties at your doorstep 
Left my judgement on your trail 

Somewhere out of these 
Somewhere out of these woods 
Somewhere out of these 
Somewhere out of these woods
