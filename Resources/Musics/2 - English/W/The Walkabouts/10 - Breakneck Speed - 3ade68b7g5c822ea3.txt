BREAKNECK SPEED

The season has come 
When nothing gets done 
Save copycat killin' 

Away from windows 
asleep on the floor 
The wheel of misfortune spins in the yard 

And by the way 
And by the way 
I'm . . . 
(And) by the way 
(And) by the way 
I'm almost moving breakneck speed 

Good news is no news 
The whole things comes down 
To character murder 

Cattle are driven 
To market or prison 
Hindsight a genius lost in the blood 

And by the way 
And by the way 
I'm . . . 
(And) by the way 
(And) by the way 
I'm almost moving breakneck speed 

Tip my hat 
And then I'm good as gone 
I'm good and ready 
Beside myself - breakneck speed 

Stretch my reach 
You know I'd steal the shoes 
Right off a dead man's feet 
Beside myself - breakneck speed
