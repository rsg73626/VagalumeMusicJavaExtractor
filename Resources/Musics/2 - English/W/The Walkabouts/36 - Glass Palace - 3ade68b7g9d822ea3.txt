GLASS PALACE

A crooked road on a country mile 
The widow walks from a letter found 
(And) ties her hands in knots and chokes her disbelief 
(That) what's done is done and it's dine for good 

Afterwards 
Aftershocks in afterhours 
The truth it blurs 
O glass palace 
O glass palace 

Cleaned his guns for those who dug his grave 
The bullets flew, his luck it finally came 
That crooked road was long and he would never see it 
Crawled in a ditch and then he almost prayed 

Afterwards 
Aftershocks in afterhours 
The truth it blurs 
O glass palace 
O glass palace 
Heard it all 
I heard it shatter 

Afterwards 
Aftershocks in afterhours 
The truth it blurs 
O glass palace 
O glass palace 
Heard it all 
I heard it shatter
