DEAD MAN RISE

Wake up dead man, there's a noise 
You must attend 
It will not quit 

Wake up dead man, there's a noise 
Your sleep is done 
Your secret's out 

Dead man rise 
You're been away from here too long 
Dead man rise 
Dead man rise 

Wake up dead man, fate has spoke 
I'm yours to kiss 
He's yours to forget 

Cause much has changed since you've been gone 
Love's grown wise 
It's rules have broken 

Dead man rise 
You're been away from here too long 
Dead man rise 
Dead man rise 

Wake up dead man, there's a noise 
There's a noise you must attend 
Wake up dead man, there's a noise 
There's a noise you must attend 
Wake up dead man, there's a noise 
There's a noise that will not quit
