THE STORMS ARE ON THE OCEAN

(Well) I'm going away to leave you 
And I'm going away for a while 
Well, I'm coming back to you someday 
When I've gone ten thousand miles 

Where the storms are on the ocean 
And the heavens will cease to be 
And this world will lose its motion 
If you don't come back to me 

Well, I left you in Whiskey Valley 
With the crimes upon your face 
And the storms were in the deep part 
In the deepest darkest plain 

Where the storms are on the ocean 
And the heavens will cease to be 
And this world will lose its motion 
If you don't come back to me
