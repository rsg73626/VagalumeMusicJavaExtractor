NOTHING IS A STRANGER

Spent another season in the valley of the bones 
But higher grounds was callin, callin me back home 
109 answers to 110 proofs 
Back up to my bed o' nails and my leakin roof 

Hold me sober and hold me still 
Hold my past up against my will 
Nothing's wrong when your head is gone 
Nothing is a stranger to me now 

All that good behavior I knew it wouldn't last 
At the funeral of fossils, I buried up the past 
But just like I predicted the past came jumpnig up 
Jumped up like a devil who had finally seen enough 

Hold me sober and hold me still 
Hold my past up against my will 
Nothing's wrong when your head is gone 
Nothing is a stranger to me now 

Saw a lighthouse in the wheatfield where I drove off the road 
But, when I got there, there was nothing but darkness in a hole 
And down inside I saw my favorite place 
Furniture all busted and the arson on her face 

Nothing is a stranger to me 
Nothing is a stranger to me 
Nothing is a stranger to me now
