NO ONE THE WISER

our healin' mark was reached
above this floodlit street
beneath a sliver moon
undone 

leaning with intent to fall
your gaze a perfect blade
my hand, a shadow
drawn 

These secrets come and go
but every secret knows
it's better to ravish
than to hold 

are we right back where we were?
or just right where we are?
can't see it for the stars
but we'll know it when it's gone 

No one the wiser
No one the wiser 

the healin' deals been struck
pain is shit-out-o'-Iuck
neither one of us, too tired to love 

just tired of bleedin' stones 
just tired of crashin' slow 
Forever shoulda' known 

no one the wiser 
no one the wiser 
no one the wiser 

do ya' feel our ghost in every stitch?
do ya' hear our ghost in every word?
are you my ghost?
or am I yours?
one thing for sure
time is gonna' soothe these shattered
eyes
time is gonna' heal things out of turn
time is gonna' mark the place to start
but leave the ending for yourself

no one the wiser
no one the wiser
