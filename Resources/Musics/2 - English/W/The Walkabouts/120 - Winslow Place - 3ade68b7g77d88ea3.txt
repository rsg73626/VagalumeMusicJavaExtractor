WINSLOW PLACE

Planes 
Fly low 
Over our heads
Over our bed 
The sky went lavender
For just one day
The sky went lavender
For just one day 
Faith... And faithful
Grace... And grateful 

The wind at winslow place 
Reached all the rooms
The wind at winslow place
Reached all the rooms

Don't ya' know 
There is hope
Braided in the rope
Drag your fear
To the clear
I'll take it for my own

Don't call
Just show 
Don't bend my ear
Don't want to know
Caress 
Don't confess it
Murder time
Don't possess it 

Reach down 
Surrender
You were my sad
Reckless driver

The wind at winslow place
Reached all the rooms
The wind at winslow place
Raced after you 

The swallows
Pause
Then streak 
N' turn
Then fade into the north
Guide wires
Suspend them
Not from heaven
Not from earth
I know they'll be returnin' 
And i guess i know you won't
