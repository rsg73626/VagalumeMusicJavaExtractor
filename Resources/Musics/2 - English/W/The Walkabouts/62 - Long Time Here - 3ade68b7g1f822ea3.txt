LONG TIME HERE

If you want good times 
I know where to look 
And if you want good times I will 

They're thrown on your bed 
With your junkyard religion 
At the best of the western motels 

Thrown with the pawns 
And the hardscrabble rooks 
Thrown with our ransom of kings 

But if you want goodtimes 
I know where to look 
And I know it's goodtimes you want 

Long time here X2
I'll keep you around 
Holding this ground 
I'll keep you a long time here 

In 24 hours 
We could be in Vegas 
Where the heat is a possible friend 

Where snake eyes and boxcars 
Could wet down your whistle 
And steal all the noise from your head 

But your hell is hotter 
Then the typical thirst 
And in Vegas the ice is not cheap 

And heaven's a backroom 
Where the gamblin' don't finish 
And you keep makin' the same mistakes 

Long time here X2
I'll keep you around 
Holding this ground 
I'll keep you a long . . . . 

Long time here X4
I'll keep you around 
Holding this ground 
I'll keep you a long time here
