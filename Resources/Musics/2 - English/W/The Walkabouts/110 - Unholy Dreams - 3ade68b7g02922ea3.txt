UNHOLY DREAMS

(Well) I dreamed I saw the devil's club 
Growin' by the burnin' bush 
And I dreamed that all your razor teeth 
Grabbed tomorrow by the root 
And I dreamed the long arm of the law 
Was a one-armed acrobat 

Yeah I dreamed 
Unholy dreams 

And I dreamed that all the sacred cows 
Had been trampled under hoof 
And I dreamed the moon had finally crashed 
And lit fire to your roof 
And I dreamed that there were sights unseen 
And their visions could be sold 

Yeah I dreamed 
Unholy dreams 

Unholy dreams X2
Last night, I dreamed unholy dreams 

And in the mornin' when I woke 
And you were gone 
(Well) I believed unholy dreams 
Yeah I believed 
Unholy dreams 
Yeah I believed
