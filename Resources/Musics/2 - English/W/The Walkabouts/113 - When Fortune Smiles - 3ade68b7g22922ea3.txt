WHEN FORTUNE SMILES

even the mightiest rivers will bend
before they vanish, in the sand
even the tallest of timbers will fall
easy to fall, ain't easy to land

well that's a curse of mine
seems everything I find
keeps fallin' till it cannot fall 
well that's a curse of mine 
in the best of times
keep fallin' till I cannot fall

That's when fortune smiled on you
I'd say fortune smiled
when you went runnin'
away from these arms

the first will be last and the
last will be drunk
goes down, easy, easy come

well that's a curse of mine
never look behind
don't look into the swath I cut
well that's a curse of mine 
never look behind
deep into the swath I cut

That's when fortune smiled on you
I'd say fortune smiled
when you went runnin'
away from these arms
these are the last things, 
the things that will last
the knife in my tears, the
jail of my fears

well that's a curse of mineX3
wicked and divine
shoulda' never tried to love me

That's when fortune smiled on you
I'd say fortune smiled
when you went runnin'
away from these arms

when you went runnin'
away from these arms
hmmmmm ... when you went runnin'
