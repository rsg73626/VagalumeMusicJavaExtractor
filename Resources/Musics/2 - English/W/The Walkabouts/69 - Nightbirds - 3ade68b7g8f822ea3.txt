NIGHTBIRDS

The nightbirds stumble in 
Like broken pendulums 
The nightbirds stumble in 
Flown from thick to thin 
'Neath a cloud of suspicion 
You're a lucky man 
Say it again 
The nightrain's pourin' down 
As the nightsky hits the town 
The nightbirds stumble in 
There are orders to be filled 
There are tall ones to be killed 
There are songs of praises to be sung 
Will they all go south on us? 
With the crazies, with our trust? 
I trust you'll tell me 
If you lose that trust 
The nightrain's pourin' down 
As the nightsky hits the town 
The nightbirds stumble in 
You're a lucky man 
Say it again 
I'm a lucky man 
Say it again
