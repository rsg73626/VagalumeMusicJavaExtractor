FREE MONEY

Every night before I go to sleep 
I find a ticket and I win a lottery 
I scoup them pearls up from the sea 
I cash them in and buy you all the things you need 

Every night before I rest my head 
See them dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed 
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad 
I take that money and buy you things you never had 

Oh baby, it would mean so much to me 
Oh baby, buy you all the things you need, for free 

Buy you a jet-plane, take you to the stratosphere 
I'll buy you a jet-plane so we can check out all that's there 
Where it's hot, hot, and ready and baby and cool, cold, you can feel the snow 
It's a long way, a long way, got a long way left to go 

When we're dreaming X2

Every night before I go to sleep 
I find a ticket and I win a lottery 
Every night before I rest my head 
See them dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed 

Oh baby, it would mean so much to me 
Oh baby, buy you all the things you need, for free 

When we're dreaming X2
When we're dreaming: free money, free money X2
