SWEET REVENGE

Fourteen and one half years 
You know I was good fortune's slave 
Road map on my face 
Up to my neck in lucky breaks 

Cover your eyes 
Don't look now 

And durin' all that time 
You know I wore this reckless coat 
Filled up with matchstick men 
And all the bibles that you wrote 

Cover your eyes, Don't look now X2

First I'll get even 
And then I'll make you proud 
Revenge is sweeter 
When you can laugh out loud 

And from these bitterroots 
You know I made a potent shine 
One-half kerosene 
One-half justice all gone blind 

First I'll get even 
And then I'll make you proud 
Revenge is sweeter 
When you can laugh out loud 

Swing it low, swing it low 
Swing it: sweet revenge X2
Swing it low 
Sweet revenge 

First I'll get even 
And then I'll make you proud 
Revenge is sweeter 
When you can laugh out loud 

Swing it low, swing it low 
Swing it: sweet revenge X2
Swing it low 
Sweet revenge
