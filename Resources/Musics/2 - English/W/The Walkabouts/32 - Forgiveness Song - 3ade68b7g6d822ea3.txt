FORGIVENESS SONG

Bang out the night song
on an old kettle drum
don't ask for no ransom
ain't payin you none

ground to a halt
with suspicion for all
you say "watch me fly"

I suppose that you're gone
but I don't care to look
don't give me the truth
give me shackles

bang out the night song
from deep in my chest
are you listening? 

But last night (Oh last night) 
late last night (late last night) 
last night, you were forgiveness
And last night (Oh last night) 
late last night (late last night) 
last night you were the end

walked to the dawn
along rnisery's mile
stopped under a streetlight
and burned off my smile

trust was your mirror
and trust was your fool
are you listenin'

and now that I'm gone
give the tears to your friends
I'll take what I'm due
then I'll strangle

bang out the night song
you can beat it to death
you can watch me fly

But last night (Oh last night) 
late last night (late last night) 
last night, you were forgiveness
And last night (Oh last night) 
late last night (late last night) 
last night you were the end

raisin' my spirits
my head on the floor
turned around fast
walkin' back to your door

this run of bad luck
stuck like sleep in yer eyes
couldn't see a thing

But last night, late last night
last night, you were forgiveness
oh last night, late last night
last night you were the end

I'm comin' back to ya
no religion to sell
bang out the night song
ain't stuck in this hell
oh last night
late last night
last night you were forgivin
