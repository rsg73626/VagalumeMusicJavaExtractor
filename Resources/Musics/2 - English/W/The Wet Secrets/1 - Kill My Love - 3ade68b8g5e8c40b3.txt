KILL MY LOVE

It's what a body in motion looks like
just a body in motion kinda looks like you
Gotta put it together just right
Gotta keep it together or it's just no use

From the roof to the streets below
it's got a hold on us
and it won't let go
Everything, everyone we know
it's gonna drag us down
but we can't let go

it's a murmuring heartbeat all night
it's a fist in a fistfight thrown at you
it's a hand in a glove it just fits right
it's a push, it's a shove
It's the gutter for you

From the roof to the streets below
it's got a hold on us
and it won't let go
Everything, everyone we know
it's gonna drag us down
but we can't let go

No Amount of Bullshit will Kill My Love

From the roof to the streets below
it's got a hold on us
and it won't let go
Everything, everyone we know
it's gonna drag us down
but we can't let go

Baby steps to the great unknown
it's going to kill our love
but we can't let go
The highest highs to the lowest lows
It's got an eye on us and we can't say no
