DEAR NOAH

Dear noah, it can be a scary world. 
there are good times and bad times, 
fun and fear in the unknown. 
just keep with you those that love you 
everywhere that you go woah oh oh oh! 

take your headphones off the world will sing you a song. to the hum of these streets we'll sing along, and these hard times pass fast together, these dreams are ours to share together, they're right in front of our eyes. 

I was younger, I was so afraid...of people, of places, of each new day. no more powders making square smiles, making hollow hearts today ay ay ay! just live how you want. the rest will come in time... 

kid it's better to be free than make a dime, and these hard times pass fast together, these dreams are ours to share together, they're right in front of our eyes. well the clouds laid down on the desert floor. mountains made of suede passed by my car, and the boss on the radio said, 'sit tight, take hold, thunderroad oh oh oad!

I said 'hey kylee? do you remember when we drove up I-95, watching the snow melt, spring bring the world alive, and these hard times pass fast together, these dreams are ours to share together, they're right in front of our eyes.
