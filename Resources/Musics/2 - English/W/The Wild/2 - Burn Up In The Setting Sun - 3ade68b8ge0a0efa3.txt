BURN UP IN THE SETTING SUN

Put away your brushes, put away your paints...
this is not some picture that you can make. 
well look me deeply in the eye 
and tell me that it's not a lie. 
it's me that can control my mind.
 it's not the truth, just a device...

for staring into the endless sky, 
for wondering about what happens when we die.
 is there anything beyond the horizon 
or do we burn up in the setting sun? 
I thought long and hard about what you had said..
 that 'some people get caught up inside their own head,' 
you looked down at me and said 

I thought that you knew,' but girl there is so much 
I need to learn from you... cause 
I am a dreamer, a leaver, a fraud, and 
I always end up back where 
I started from, and it never feels like where 
I belong. thank god sometimes friends
 feel like home..take me home. 
I
'm glad that I know you as a friend, 
I'm even more glad that I kissed you 
and I wanna do it again. 
it's just that you know there's more than we can see... 
that what we know is narrow and brief. 
and I've got to say it inspires me, 
the way you know that if we work together 
that we'll be set free...
of anger, of hatred, all those things that ain't right, 
and oh my god I feel free tonight. 
'give it back!' 'oh no I won't!' '
give it back!' 'oh no I won't!'
