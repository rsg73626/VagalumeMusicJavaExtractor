BREATHE CITY LIGHTS

Open up my eyes tonight, looking for a place to hide, 
and dreams are what people do when 
their only choice is to make a move, 
and I want to know if you want to? 
one last chance to make a stand, 
I'm tired of all the people I've been, 
so I cut 'em off, look inside, 
but I would be anybody 
that you want me to be tonight. 
where'd you go my only friend, 
only looked for what you get, 
so I packed my bags, went outside, 
took to the streets at night, 
and I will breathe all these city lights. 
open up my eyes tonight, looking for a place to hide, 
and dreams are what people do 
when their only choice is to make a move, 
and I want to know if you want to?
