EVERYTHING WE NEED

It's in the darkest depths we know that we sow the seeds 
Of something beautiful. 
On the blackest night we see the stars bright glow, 
But not if we close our eyes...
No we can't just close our eyes. 
I saw my neighbor in the street. 

We talked of family, of war, and the economy. 
He said, 'boy I lost it all, but here's the irony...
I found everything I need, we've got everything we need, 
No love don't care about lost money...

We've got everything we need.' 
All these debts that we owe are relieved when we know...
The expense of our lives is not met with what we buy. 
It's a fixed game we're in. 
Don't doubt the value of a friend, 
And please stick by my side. 
Oh I need you by my side. 
I'll stick by your side, if you'll be right by mine. 

I find solace in the woods when the city's grip gets too unberable. 
Next to trees my problems seem miniscule.
 I think of those that need a hand, 
Sometimes we just need a hand, 
No hope don't grow from a stimulus plan...

Sometimes we just need a hand. 
All these debts that we owe are relieved when we know...
The expense of our lives is not met with what we buy. 
It's a fixed game we're in. 
Don't doubt the value of a friend, 
And please stick by my side. 
Oh I need you by my side. 
I'll stick by your side, if you'll be right by mine.
