IDEAS OF HOME

We left our homes, 
Desperate for places far away from where we're from. 
And I was afraid, 
Thought I'd be lost without a map to guide my way, 
But I was in love...

Haunted by a ghost, an open road, 
Freedom. these ideas of home saturate my mind 
Like a southern rainstorm, 
And I fall to my knees when I realize that
 
What's real ain't just what I believe, 
And so it seems that right where we are is right 
Where we're supposed to be. 
And now we see ourselves for what we really are...

Reflections in car windows as we look at the stars.
