SILVER & GOLD

I drew a line down in the sand
Just to see if you cross again
'Cause I know people, they will never change
Same old story, just a different day

Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ey
Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ey

I'll be silver, I'll be gold
Have my heart believe my soul
All that's done will be forgot
And I've forgiven
It took some time, but now I know
The lesson was just letting go
And I'll feel fine

I can't keep watching from the rearview mirror
'Cause things seem closer than they appear
Don't need a reason to know I'm right this time
I see the good that's in goodbye

Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ey
Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ey

I'll be silver, I'll be gold
Have my heart believe my soul
All that's done will be forgot
And I've forgiven
It took some time, but now I know
The lesson was just letting go
And I'll feel fine

I'll be silver, I'll be gold
Have my heart believe my soul
All that's done will be forgot
And I've forgiven
It took some time, but now I know
The lesson was just letting go
And I'll feel fine

Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ey
Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ey
