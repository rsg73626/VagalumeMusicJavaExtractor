TO MARS

To mars (4:00) msa
 
Doesn’t matter where I go
You’ll stay in my mind
If flowers here once have grew
It was due to your light
Alone
That’s the way I’ve got to stay
When I was supposed to see I was blind
 
All is gone
Memories of your red lips
Kissing me and taking me to mars
 
Sometimes we make mistakes
Battles of evil and good
From the shambles of my life
Your love will come and rule
 
Alone
That’s the way I’ve got to stay
When I was supposed to see I was blind
 
All is gone 
Your presence put a spell on me
Now I have no air to survive
 
solo
 
(up 5 tons)
Alone 
That’s the way I’ve got to stay
When I was supposed to see I was blind
 
All is gone 
Memories of your red lips
Kissing me and taking me to mars
 
To mars
To mars
To mars
To mars
 
Mars....
