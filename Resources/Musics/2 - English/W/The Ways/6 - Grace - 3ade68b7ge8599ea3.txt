GRACE

Grace (3:57) msa
 
The sky was grey like my life
You turned to me and said
That our love had to be
Extinguished overnight
Conveniences would come first
 
Oh babe, you were wrong
 
Long live to you, oh yes
I think you’re fine
I’ve got to stand this loneliness
Despite my fears and blue
I won’t die
 
My days are grey on these raining days
Now I’ve turned my back and slammed the door to past
Maybe I was amazed
By way you pleased me all the time
In a crazy way I loved you
 
Oh babe, you’re wrong
 
It’s up to you, oh yes
The time is now
I got to stand this loneliness
Despite my tears and blue
I won’t die
 
When I sing that little song
I remember that I’m alone
Defending me against the evil
The sweet evil of your grace
Of your grace
 
This sweet evil of your grace
Of your grace
