SAD SONG

Sad song (3:36) msa
 
Lonely days...
Anytime, oh I feel this pain
For this love I’ve been crying
For these wounds in my heart
 
I’m singing this sad song
That reminds me how I’m lonesome
Passion and love are two different things
Feelings that come along
 
I’m singing a sad song 
 
I’m crying, she walks
I need you, your love  
I’m crying, she talks
I’m dreaming you’re back home  
 
And when I think of you
I feel love inside
I wanted to hold you
I wanted to show you my love   
And sing this song no more
 
I’m crying, she talks
I need you, your love  
I’m crying, she talks
I’m dreaming you’re back home  (4x)
