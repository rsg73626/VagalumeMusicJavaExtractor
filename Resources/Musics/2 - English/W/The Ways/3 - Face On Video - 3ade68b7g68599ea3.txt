FACE ON VIDEO

Face on video (2:59) silva/msa
 
It’s all about truth
Or is it a fake life?
Nothing more to prove
Fame that gets you higher (fake life)
A brief moment of fool’s applause
 
I saw your face on the video (ooh)
On the video (ooh)
Spotlights of fortune and easy fame always lie
 
Selling your stories to unknowns
Money is coming around
No matter at which cost
Even if they’re playing clowns (all around)
A brief moment of fool’s applause
 
I saw your face on the video (ooh)
On the video (ooh)
