WE ARE WRONG

We Are Wrong (5:16) msa
 
I woke up one day and 
Realised how it worked out
I understood that love isn’t 
Moving the things around us
 
But I believe in a day 
When everything will change
And the blacks and whites will be alright
Doesn’t matter how
 
No, no, no, no, no, no
Love is counting low (4x)
 
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that we
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that we
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that we wrong
 
Music grooves
It brings love and compassion
So let’s move! cause without love
Ain’t no reaction
 
Sorry is a hard word to say
Let’s make it all clear
We are black and white deep inside
Same ups and downs
 
No, no, no, no, no, no
Love is counting low (4x)
 
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that we
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that we
We are, we are, we are wrong
I really know that we wrong
