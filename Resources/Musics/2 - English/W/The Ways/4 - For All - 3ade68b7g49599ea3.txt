FOR ALL

For all(5:00) msa / Silva
 
Look these people
Cast aside and scared
Forlorn souls without hope
 
Only worries
Dashing off their plans
Rusted iron is at odds with gold
 
A fearless life set you free 
For a possible dream
Stand up and go ahead
Cause Lord is around in the air
 
For all, Lord is around in the air
For all, there’s a future for you if you dare
 
Please don’t tell me 
Melancholic words
About the fate of mankind
 
Trust the flame of justice
That brings light to blind men,
Food to the hearts and peace of mind
 
A fearless life set you free 
For a possible dream
Stand up and go ahead
Cause Lord is around in the air
 
For all, Lord is around in the air
For all, there’s a future for you if you dare
 
Future belongs for those whom
Never rip off their dreams
Stand up and go ahead!
Cause Lord is around in the air
 
For all, Lord is around in the air
For all, there’s a future for you if you dare(3x)
