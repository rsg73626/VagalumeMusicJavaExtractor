BLACK SHEEP

Black Sheep
MÚSICA : MARCOS SÁ
LETRAS : MARCOS SÁ
 
Oh! Mother!
Could have been easier
Oh! Mother!
Thanks for your patience
No one in the family had been played since then
You hardly could imagine
Oh! Mother!
I'll make my way... of life
I'm on my way.
Oh! Mother!
I'm not a jerk, lazy bad boy
Oh! Father!
I've told you I wanted to play guitar
I've got serious about my future
To be musician needs culture
Oh! Mother!
I'll get away
Black sheep
I'm the Black sheep (4x)
What's your big sin
To have a bunch of rockers here (2x)
Sorry mama I can't stop this noise!
