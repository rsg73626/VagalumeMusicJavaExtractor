I’LL BE AROUND

I’ll be around (4:30) Sá/Silva
Nothing seems wrong
I’m thinking of you
Oh! remembering your soft voice
Running out my head
 
Now I’ve started my day
With you in my mind
And this will to stay in your arms
Is driving me insane
 
Oh, don’t keep me waiting for too long
Don’t leave me this way
If you need a friend just call my name
 
I’ll be around
Don’t forget me
I’ll be around
I’m here
Our love could be magic don’t let me down
I’ll be around
 
I walk on the streets
Late at night
And the city lights reminds me your eyes
Amazing eyes
 
I won’t forget
Your smile is on me like a tattoo
You’re a watermark on my destiny,
you’ll always be
 
Oh, don’t keep me waiting for too long
Don’t leave me this way
If you need a friend just call my name
 
I’ll be around
Don’t forget me
I’ll be around
I’m here
Our love could be magic don’t let me down
I’ll be around
 
The city lights
In the dead of the night
Reminds me your eyes (2x)
