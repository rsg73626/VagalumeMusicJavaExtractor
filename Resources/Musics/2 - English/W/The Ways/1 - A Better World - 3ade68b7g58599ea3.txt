A BETTER WORLD

A Better world (3:44) msa/silva
Ahh...
Ahh...
 
How many bombs and children’s life 
Are going to be wasted?
Somebody tell me why?
 
Cause I can’t stand 
The indifference of such a propagated hate
People are walking on the edge of knife
 
A better? 
A better?
A better world to live in? (2x)
 
The daily news
Are worse and worse as never seen before
We’re experiencing scaring times
 
Politics are talking, nothing to say
Waste of time  
They’re spreading conflicts like their lies
 
A better?
A better?
A better world to live in? (4x)
 
Misery and starvation are still on the way
I wish it could be a happier song
“Fin de la vie” not means “end of the road”
Our hope remains but the peace has gone
The peace has gone 
 
A better? 
A better?
A better world to live in? (2x)
