GLORY AND HOPE

Glory and hope (4:00) msa 
 
The desert sands
Soon they’ll be on their graves
Allah Akbar
Blessing the blood of the braves
 
They’ll face the fight
Against all the evil empire
To set they free
To go as far as their mind
 
 
There’s no way 
To escape from the infidel’s game
All is gone, dead and gone 
Get down on his knees and pray
 
By his hands
Enemies will scream in pain
Silent cries
Of people that pray and believe
In better days 
In glory and hope for his sons
At the killing fields 
Fighting in name of liberty
 
 
There’s no way 
To escape from the infidel’s game
All is gone, dead and gone 
Get down on his knees and pray
 
Solo
 
Hoooope
Oh! (2x)
 
There’s no way 
To escape from the infidel’s game
All is gone, gone, gone 
Get down on his knees and pray
