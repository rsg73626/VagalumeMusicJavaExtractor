OUT OF OUR TREE

Out, runnin' around
seein' every crazy sight
A lady in a evenin' gown
made from a paper kite
We asked her why
she wore such a crazy gown
She said if ya wanna fly
ya gotta get off the ground

Don't know what we hear an' see
hey, we gotta be...
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
Out of our tree

Ran a little ways more
and we happened to meet
A man building a door
right in the middle of the street
We asked him why
he did such a crazy thing
He said if ya wanna get by
the doorbell ya hafta ring

Don't know what we hear an' see
hey, we gotta be...
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
Out of our tree

[then we saw] a cat
diggin' through a garbage can
Out jumped a rat
a dog an' the garbage man
Now everything we see
we don't try to figure out
We know that it just can't be
but it's happenin' without a doubt

Don't know what we hear an' see/
hey, we gotta be...
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
