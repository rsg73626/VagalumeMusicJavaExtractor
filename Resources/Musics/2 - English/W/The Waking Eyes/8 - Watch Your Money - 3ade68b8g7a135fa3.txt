WATCH YOUR MONEY

"I got a picture and it do what I need
I got a garden and I planted some seed
Give me an hour and I'll get what you want
Or you can find somebody else to get off

Watch your money
Watch your money
Watch your money
Everybody wants somebody
Watch your money

I got a package and I know what to do
I got my goggles on so I can see through you
Give me a minute and I'll get what you like
So I can keep you coming all through the night

Watch your money
Watch your money
Watch your money
Everybody wants some body
Watch your money

My hands are shaking and I want you to know
You know I got the money and I'm ready to blow
I got to have an hour just to get what you want
Or you can find somebody else to get off

Watch your money
Watch your money
Watch your money
Everybody wants some body
Watch your money

Watch your money
Watch your money
Watch your money
Everybody wants some body
Watch your money"
