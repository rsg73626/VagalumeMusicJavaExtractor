MOVE ON

"He will not return
Before he crash and burns
Are you going to learn from this? 
Learn from this?

The less you think about his pretty head
The more you gonna see that his love for you is dead

He will not return
Before he crash and burns
Are you going to learn from this? 
Move on if he's drivin' you crazy
Oh, you gotta move on if his lovin' gets lazy

I would never leave you all alone
But as long as he's gone you'll be waitin' on the phone

He will not return
Before he crash and burns
Are you going to learn from this?
Move on if he's drivin' you crazy
Oh, you gotta move on if his lovin' gets lazy

He will not return
Before he crash and burns
Are you going to learn from this?
Learn from this?
Learn from this?
Learn from this?

Move on if he's drivin' you crazy
Oh, you gotta move on if his lovin' gets lazy
Move on if he's drivin' you crazy
Oh, you gotta move on if his lovin' gets lazy "
