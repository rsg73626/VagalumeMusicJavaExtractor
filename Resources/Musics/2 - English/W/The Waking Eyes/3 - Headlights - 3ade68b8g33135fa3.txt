HEADLIGHTS

"I've been movin' along
But just to get away
Airstreams carry me on
And at the end of the day
I wake up

Only to find that you're on my mind
It happens all of the time
And I, I don't know why

You're caught in the headlights
I want to tell you
It's taken it all night
Just to burn through
You're caught in the headlights
And now you're chasin'
What's makin' you feel right
My heart is always racin'

Ashtray catchin' the rain
On an empty patio
And I'm just goin' insane
'Cause they don't ever want me to go
Where I'm going

Only to find that you're on my mind
It happens all of the time
And I, I don't know why

You're caught in the headlights
I want to tell you
It's taken it all night
Just to burn through
You're caught in the headlights
And now you're chasin'
What's makin' you feel right
My heart is always racin'

You're caught in the headlights
I want to tell you
It's taken it all night
Just to burn through
You're caught in the headlights
And now you're chasin'
What's makin' you feel right
My heart is racin'

You're caught in the headlights
I want to tell you
It's taken it all night
Just to burn through
You're caught in the headlights
And now you're chasin'
What's makin' you feel right
My heart is racin'

You're caught in the headlights
I want to tell you
It's taken it all night
Just to burn through
You're caught in the headlights
And now you're chasin'
What's makin' you feel right
My heart is always racin' "
