ON A TRAIN

"Here smokin' on a train
Leanin' on the pain
'Cause all I have is my own hard luck
Yeah I took off
Had to get away
I didn't want to pay a penance to all the cold hard luck

Somehow I knew your intention was to
Wrap me up around and around
Lock me away
So I just put my foot on the ground
I walked away

No way to tell me when
I screw it up again
Falling victim to my hard luck
Yeah I was blind 
I just couldn't find
Your silhouette behind the spectre of all my hard luck again

Somehow I knew your intention was to
Wrap me up around and around
Lock me away
So I just put my foot on the ground
I walked away

I'm leavin' babe
To go back to my place 
And out of the rat race
Those at the table are ready and able
To put something on it
It better be chronic
Watchin' the night slip away

Wrap me up around and around
Lock me away

Wrap me up around and around
Lock me away
So I just put my foot on the ground
I walked away

Wrap me up around and around
Just lock me away
Wrap me up around and around
I walked away

So I'm leavin' on a train "
