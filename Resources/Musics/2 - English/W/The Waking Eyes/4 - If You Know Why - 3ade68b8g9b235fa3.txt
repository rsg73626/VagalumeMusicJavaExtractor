IF YOU KNOW WHY

Breakin' it lightly across your back and mine.
Twistin' it slowly as we reach for the line.
Yes they're screamin' it softly now so we can't hear the way.
And it's never too late.  Never.

If we don't take the time to create.
Why don't you, why don't you come back love?

If you know why we walk the broken road.
Could you get by if I would take the load?
Pushin' it through avoid a situation.
What's it to you?

Runnin' on empty with a long way to go.
Nothin' upsets me but the fact that I know.
They're just hanging it over our heads till the old engine blows.
And its never too late.  Never.

If we don't take the time to create.
Why don't you, why don't you bring back love?

If you know why we walk the broken road.
Could you get by if I would take the load?
Pushin' it through avoid a situation.
What's it to you if it was my creation.  My creation.

Why do we pretend that the waiting is only frustrating to us?

If you know why we walk the broken road.
Could you get by if I'm alone?

If you know why we walk the broken road.
Could you get by if I would take the load?
Pushin it through avoid a situation.
What's it to you?

Bring me back love.  Why don't you bring me back?
Bring me back love.  Why don't you bring me back?
Bring me back love.  A funny situation.
Bring me back love.  Yeah, if it was my creation.
Bring me back love.  Why don't you bring me back?
Bring me back love.  Can you bring me back, can you bring me back love?
Bring me back love.  Bring me back baby I need it.
Bring me back love.  Why don't you bring me back love?
