GOODBYE

I’ll take back
oh, what I said to you
I didn’t mean it
but I believed it too
you’re old news
you’re not worth the trouble
so don’t go poppin’
my little bubble

chorus:
you’re outta time 
another call on the other line
I’ll follow the signs
you got a different guy
so goodbye, goodbye

ten miles
is all I’m willing to go
I have the style
and you will never know
I’m not attracted
not even for a minute
I’m not addicted
I didn’t even hit it

chorus:
you’re outta time 
another call on the other line
I’ll follow the signs
you got a different guy
so goodbye, goodbye 

you’re outta time 
another call on the other line
I’ll follow the signs
you got a different guy
so goodbye, goodbye 
goodbye, goodbye		
yeah yeah yeah yeah
