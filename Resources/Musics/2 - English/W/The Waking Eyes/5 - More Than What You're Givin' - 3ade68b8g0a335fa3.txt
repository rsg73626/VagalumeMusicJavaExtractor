MORE THAN WHAT YOU'RE GIVIN'

Are you a knife in the dark?
Patiently awaiting a chance
To take a stab at my heart
Do ya do ya wanna dance?

Yeah what do you got
Are you just artificially feeling
Yeah show me you're not
Cause you know what i need is the real thing

You gotta get you gotta get
More than what you're givin
More than what you're givin
You gotta get you gotta get
Something out of livin
Something out of livin your way

Yeah are you only reactive
Cause you gotta make a move
I'll be watching like a detective
Girl how you gonna handle the groove

Yeah what do you got
Are you just artificially feeling
Yeah show me you're not
Cause you know what i need is the real thing

You gotta get you gotta get
More than what you're givin
More than what you're givin
You gotta get you gotta get
Something out of livin
Something out of livin

You gotta get you gotta get
More than what you're givin

Babe you gotta get babe you gotta get
Something out of livin
Something out of livin your way
