BEGINNING

"Take a little, shake a little, make a little money
Let it shine brighter, feel lighter, bonafide to get you honey
Something's gonna, something gonna, something's gonna give
With all of the non-stoppin' pop-croppin' kill it off and I can live

Hey, I think there's something happenin'
'Cause it feels like the beginning of a season
Anything you wanna do, girl
Do it 'till you get it through, girl
You only have to stay awake
Yeah, to protect you when it all breaks down

Crave it up, and save it up and get the one you wanted
Yeah, on the ball you spend it all,
and get the call because you flaunted it, baby
Tell me what you, tell me what you, tell me what you wanna choose, baby
If all our happiness is measured out,
then why are we all singin' the blues

Hey, I think there's something happenin'
'Cause it feels like the beginning of a season
Anything you wanna do, girl
Do it 'till you get it through, girl
You only have to stay awake
Yeah, to protect you when it all breaks down

It's a drag to turn it off
You won't because it kills the buzz

Something's gonna, something's gonna, something's gonna give
Something's gonna, something's gonna, something's gonna give
Something's gonna, something's gonna, something's gonna give

Anything you wanna do, girl
Do it 'till you get it through, girl
You only have to stay awake
Yeah, to protect you when it all breaks down

Anything you wanna do, girl
Do it 'till you get it through, girl
You only have to stay awake
Yeah, to protect you when it all breaks down "
