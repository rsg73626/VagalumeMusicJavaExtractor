SHE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU

Hey
There's a battle raging on
And you fight all day
You try to figure it out
You don't think
That she's ready for a change
That she's tired of the way you've handled yourself
And you gotta know

She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you

You say
You don't think
You don't think
You can change
So you (?) and sit
And you act like you're ahead of the game
And it's getting old

So just let her slip away
Every time you try again you just keep in the pain
And you gotta know

She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you

Someone's gonna come thru
Someone's gonna come thru for you

Someone's gonna come thru
Someone's gonna come thru for you

Cause
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
