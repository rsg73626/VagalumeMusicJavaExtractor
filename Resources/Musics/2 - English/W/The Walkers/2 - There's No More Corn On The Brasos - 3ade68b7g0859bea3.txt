THERE'S NO MORE CORN ON THE BRASOS

There's no more corn on the Brazos - o oho oho
They grinded it all up in molasses - o oho oho

Captain, don't you do me like you've done for Shine - o oho oho
Well, you've driven that bully till he went stone blind - o oho oho

Your come on the river in 1904 - o oho oho
You could find many dead men on every turn of the road - o oho

There's no more corn on the Brasos - o oho oho
They grinded it all up in molasses - o oho oho

You've been on the river 1910 - o oho oho
Well, they're drivin th women like they drive the men - o oho oho

Rise up all dead men, help me drive my load - o oho oho
Oh, rise up all dead men, help me drive my load - o oho oho

There's no more corn on the Brasos - o oho oho
They grinded it all up in molasses - o oho oho
