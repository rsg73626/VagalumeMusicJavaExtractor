I ADORE HER

The Walkers - 1973

I Adore Her 

When shadows fall and stars appears
This pain I feel I cannot hear
If I could relive that faithful day
I would not turn my love away

I reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love thru-out life assure her
If this moment I could Amour her.

When I think of her tender lips
Gentle touch of her fingertips
Reminisce on her eyes so fair
Moonlight soft on her downy hair

I reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love thru-out life assure her
If this moment I could Amour her
