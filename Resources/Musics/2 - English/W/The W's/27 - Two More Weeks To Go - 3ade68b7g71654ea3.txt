TWO MORE WEEKS TO GO

We played this song for the millionth time today. How long can this go on? Two chords and a catchy phrase have paved our way. This fad is still going strong. Wo, oh, oh two more weeks to go. Wo, oh, oh two more weeks to go. Wo, oh, oh then we get to go home. Floor of the van is my bed. I lay and listen to the sounds. The engine whirs in my head. My body's tossed all around. Claustrophobia is setting in. These spaced seem so small. Two more weeks and then we're done. But it still seems so long.
