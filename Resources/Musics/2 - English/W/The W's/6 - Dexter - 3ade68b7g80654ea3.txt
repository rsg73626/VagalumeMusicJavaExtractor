DEXTER

Dexter was this little town my family used to live in. All my kin lived real close and everyone had an opinion. Grandma and gramps lived up the street, right next to the walnut tree. Grandpa died of Parkinsons in 1983. Riding on the gocart, at my next door neighbor's house. I couldn't tell the brake peddle, from the cavities in his mouth. Ran right over his dog and cat, as the wheels left the ground. Didn't know a tree could make such a resonating sound. Trips in the ambulance like rides at the county fair. Needles, shots, and setting bones anyone can bare. Hospitals smell real good, and HBO is free. Dexter town is simple people, just like you and me. Thanksgiving was a Roosters house on a cold holiday. I was voting turkey, but we had chicken anyway. Never thought that I'd get sick but the bird had its reasoning. Nothing I'd say quite like good ol' salmanella poisoning. Trips in the ambulance like rides at the county fair. Needles, shots, and setting bones anyone can bare. Hospitals smell real good, and HBO is free. Dexter town is simple people, just like you and me. Jenkins were some strange folks, who lived on down the street. Mobile homes and pickup trucks, they were all some kind of freaks. Jimmy, he could fix a car but he couldn't read a book. High school taught him noth'n a 350 V-8 wouldn't. Trips in the ambulance like rides at the county fair. Needles, shots, and setting bones anyone can bare. Hospitals smell real good, and HBO is free. Dexter town is simple people, just like you and me.
