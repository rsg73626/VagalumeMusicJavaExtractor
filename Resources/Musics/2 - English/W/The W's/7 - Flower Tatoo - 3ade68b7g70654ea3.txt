FLOWER TATOO

Do you want to go for a walk you can hold my hand we can laugh and talk. You can lead the way, which way you want to go, tell me all the things I really, really want to know. Hair is gold and her eyes are blue I'm in love with a girl with a flower tattoo and if I wrote the prefect song you know I'd name it after you. T-shirt, sneakers, some faded blue jeans, pocket in the back ripped from the seams. Doesn't really care what she hears or sees, what they think about her what they think about me. Hair is gold and her eyes are blue I'm in love with a girl with a flower tattoo and if I wrote the perfect song you know I'd name it after you.
