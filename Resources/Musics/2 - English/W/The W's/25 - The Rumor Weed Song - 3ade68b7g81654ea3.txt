THE RUMOR WEED SONG

Have you heard of the one about Alfred? A dangerous robot I'm told. He's got lazers for eyes and a microchip brain and his skin is terribly cold. We've heard the one about Alfred. It's strange, amazing, untrue. But now that we've heard about Alfred, we'd like to hear more about you. I'm a rumor weed (he's a rumor weed),I'm a rumor weed (he's a rumor weed), a tiny little story is all I need to make a big mess. So what is a rumor? It starts a story, maybe its true, maybe not. But once you repeat it its hard to defeat it now look at the mess that you've got. Alfred's a robot, everyone knows.The story is all over town. Us rumor weeds know how a rumor can grow just like a big weed in the ground. I'm a rumor weed (he's a rumor weed), I'm a rumor weed (he's a rumor weed), a tiny little story is all I need to make a big mess. Don't start rumors (no, no) don't start rumors. Words can hurt, they spread like a tumor, so play it safe and don't start a rumor. I'm a rumor weed (he's a rumor weed), I'm a rumor weed (he's a rumor weed), a tiny little story is all I need to make a big mess. A tiny little story is all I need, you better watch out for the rumor weed!
