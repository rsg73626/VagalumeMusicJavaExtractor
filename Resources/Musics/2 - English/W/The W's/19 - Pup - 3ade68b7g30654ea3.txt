PUP

Followed you home one night after work. Saw you go inside and watch Captain Kirk. Ten o'clock rolled around the lights went out that's when I decided to roam about. I want to see your house from the inside I want to feel like it's mine all mine. I dreamt about you every night and day. That's why I want you to come out and play. I crawled through your window cause your door was locked the floor was creaking as I walked. Strolled through your kitchen and into your den. That's where I found my old friend. I got some food and put it in his dish. He started to growl cause it smelled like fish. I want to see your house from the inside I want to feel like it's mine all mine. I dreamt about you every night and day. That's why I want you to come out and play. Saw some lights outside the door. Guys in uniforms and a whole lot more. One guy jumped me and wrestled me down the next thing I knew I was being hauled downtown. I couldn't figure out why they locked me up when all I wanted to do was feed your pup. I want to see your house from the inside I want to feel like it's mine all mine. I dreamt about you every night and day. That's why I want you to come out and play.
