NOTHING

The sun has long been gone, the moon has found it's place. The feelings left inside, are feelings left to hide. And I say to you now, I've lost sight of what's to see. I feel no more, the will is gone. I have nothing. Take me, take me as I am. I feel the walls surrounding me and I am weak so help me now. Help me, help me in this world. This world, kills me slowly. Take me, take me as I am. Clear the mess inside of me so I can see again. Help me, help me in this world. This world is killing me. Please don't let me be. Take me as I am. The questions slowly build the walls that block my path. I wonder where you've gone, I wonder if I'll last. And I say to you now, I cannot go on alone. Help me now, I've lost me way. I have nothing.
