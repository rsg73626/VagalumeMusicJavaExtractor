HIT 'EM WHERE IT HURTS

found a way to hit those suckers where it hurts and I know, wo, oh, it's gonna hurt for a while. They don't play by my terms so I'm gonna sit back and watch 'em squirm. Cause I made the call now they'll take the fall and by golly gonna get 'em good. No mistakes are allowed here, that minor human trait has got to go. As for me and my authority, I got the right to judge can't you see. Don't give a darn about your future. Forgive and forget is for the birds. I want to see a perfect mold like me. Then the world would be so happy.
