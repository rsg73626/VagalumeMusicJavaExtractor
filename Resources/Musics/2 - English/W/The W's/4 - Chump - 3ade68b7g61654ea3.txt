CHUMP

Standing on the corner of the street. Waiting for you in this humid heat because you're late again and I think this is the end. I'm not going to wait for you anymore. I'm not going to wait for you anymore. I'm not going to wait for you anymore. No, no, no. Listening to the ringing of the phone. Pretending that you are not at home. You don't wanna talk to me. You weren't at the Beanery. Sorry I left you behind. Sorry you're not on time. Sorry it's 3 am. and you are late again. Standing on stage ready to go. Wondering if you are going to show. Because you're late again and I think this is the end.
