OPEN MINDED

Open minded is your middle name, you took us in with a blink of an eye. Dancing fancy can't you tell me why you had your sudden change of mind. Spoke a word or two about my God, then we were not the people we were before. Put your label on us we suck now, a couple of words have changed our sound. Hey--I thought you'd be better. Ho--I guess I misunderstood. Hey--You're so very openminded, you're so very open minded. Then there's you, you fortunate few, with your minds made up and the best point of view. With opportunity oh what you'd change, what you'd do to make it your way. The looks keep coming as you walk on by, you think the way we do it is a compromise. Question 1, 2, and 3. One too many for me. Hey--I thought you'd be better. Ho--I guess I misunderstood. Hey--You're so very openminded, you're so very openminded.
