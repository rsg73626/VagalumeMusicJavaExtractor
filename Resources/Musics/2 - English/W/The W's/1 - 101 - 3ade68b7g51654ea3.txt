101

One more cup to make it through. Three more hours to go till the paper's due. One more page, is all I need. Eyes so red I think they're gonna bleed. Quarter past 5 take it on back to my house. I feel fine. 101. I gotta say this is not much fun. I used to think that I was wrong. Found out I was right. All along. Ride my bike through the rain. Was my studying, all in vain? I turn my work in on time. Professor Brown said I did just fine. Quarter past 3 take it on back to my house. I did fine.
