FLOWER TATTOO

Do ya wanna go for a walk
You can hold my hand we can laugh and talk
You can lead the way which ever you wanna go
Tell me all the things i really really wanna know.

Hair is gold and her eyes are blue.
Im in love with a girl with a flower tattoo.
If i wrote the perfect song you know id name it after you.

...some faded blue jeans.
a pocket in the back
rip on the seams
doesnt really care what she hears or sees.
what they think about her what they think about me.
CHORUS:
Hair is gold and her eyes are blue.
Im in love with a girl with a flower tattoo.
If i wrote the perfect song you know id name it after you.

Do ya wanna go for a walk
You can hold my hand we can laugh and talk
You can lead the way which ever you wanna go
Tell me all the things i really really wanna know.

repeat chorus 2x
