ALARM CLOCK

Woke up this morning to the sound of an alarm clock ringing in my ear. I rubbed my eyes glanced at my clock hit my roomate James in the head with a sock. Rolled out of bed got to my feet and started a new week. It's an average day and nothing really stands out, I'm just skating on the same route. I'm feeling fine, I've got nothing to complain about. I'm on my way it's just an average day. On my way to my art history class I saved 5 people from drowning in a lake. When I got home I got a call from a man we all call the president. He wanted advice, I told him I can't help I'm busy. It's an average day and nothing really stands out, I'm just skating on the same route. I'm feeling fine, I've got nothing to complain about. I'm on my way it's just an average day. I turned on the television to see what's on but to my surprise the lottery was on TV. It was 4 6 36 25 and 3. I had won 5 or 6 mil, well isn't that neat. It's an average day and nothing really stands out, I'm just skating on the same route. I'm feeling fine, I've got nothing to complain about. I'm on my way it's just an average day. I turned off the TV and went to bed after all tomorrow is a big day, not an average day. It's an average day and nothing really stands out, I've got nothing to complain about. I'm on my way, it's just an average day.
