STUPID

There was this little old lady. She had a poodle doggy. One day while giving little FiFi a bath, she thought of an innovation. So after some tender lovin, she threw her into the microwave oven. That poor little poodle never heard the bell ding. She went out with a bang, if you know what I mean. Stupid that was stupid. No you can't say that that was smart. Stupid sometimes we're stupid. Our brains must be falling apart. This one guy got arrested. His presence was requested. It seems he was suspected of breaking and stealing from vending machines. Well he swore that he was innocent, so he paid off his bail and home he went. But soon back to jail our hero was sent because he paid off his bail with quarters and dimes. Stupid that was stupid. No you can't say that that was smart. Stupid sometimes we're stupid. Our brains have a missing part. Some people pound their Bibles, waving them at their rivals. Just like in Paul's epistles, our gentleness is evident to all. We throw the heathen into a panic. As we're bombing abortion clinics. While insisting to the cynics, they will know we are Christians by our love. Stupid that is stupid. No you can't say that that is smart. Stupid sometimes we're stupid. Lord we could use a change of heart. Stupid that is stupid. No you can't say that that is smart. Stupid sometimes we're stupid. Lord we could use a change of heart.
