WHERE SHOULD I GO?

I don't know where I should go, around the corner or through the door. Some days, some how, some way, it just won't show. To the top and down again or all the way back home. Where oh where should I go? So the time has come for me to think about how it's gonna be this time next week. Should I care or should I stare at the wall in front of me? Let it stop, or let me see. Which way to go, how will I know, I don't think this is the way. No words to use, no one should know, just exactly what to say. All I know is I don't want to stay where I'm at today. Where oh where should I go? I don't seem to know where I should really go. Some days, some how, some way, just won't show. To the top and down again or all the way back home. Where oh where should I go?
