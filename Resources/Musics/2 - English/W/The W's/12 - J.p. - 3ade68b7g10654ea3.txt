J.P.

Hey, hey you, looks like you've got lots of time.
Staying up real late, sleeping all day.
Look at you playing your video games.
Drinking slurpees outside the Circle K,
And skating your life away.

Hey, hey you, why don't you just grow up.
Hey, hey you, why don't you just grow up.

The real world is passing you by, just you wait and
see.
High school is over now,
Soon you will be old and crusty like me.

Hey, hey you, why don't you just grow up.
Hey, hey you, why don't you just grow up.

This is not some job flipping nasty burgers at the
local drive through.
Sitting around all day dreaming of the W's.
Becoming famous rock stars,
I'll be working 9 to 5 jealous of you, yeah jealous of
you.

Hey, hey you, why don't you just grow up.
Hey, hey you, why don't you just grow up.
