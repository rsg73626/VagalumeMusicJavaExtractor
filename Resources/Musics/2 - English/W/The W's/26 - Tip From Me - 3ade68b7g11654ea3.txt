TIP FROM ME

I can understand why you think things are fine the way they are and I don't blame you, I've seen the example and I can't figure it out myself, figure out myself. I can see the silhouette of summer. I can see the sun crashing through. I can feel the rain but know it'll rain no more. Please take this tip from me. Please take this tip from me. Show your love through me. Unity has turned up missing seen by all that look inside. So called freedom, traded for bondage and I expect a change of mind, I wouldn't mind a change. I can see why you don't want this after all we've done for it, we're known for love resembling hatred proudly shown to humble all, I'm humbled by what shows.
