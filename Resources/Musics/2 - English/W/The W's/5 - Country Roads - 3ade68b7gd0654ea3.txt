COUNTRY ROADS

Almost heaven, West Virginia. Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah river. Life is old there, older than the trees. Younger than the mountains blowin' in the breeze. Country roads take me home, to the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home country roads.All my memories gother 'round her. Miner's lady stranger to blue water.Dark and dusty, painted on the sky. Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye. Country roads, take me home to the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home country roads. I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me. The radio reminds me of my home far away. And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday. Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home country roads.
