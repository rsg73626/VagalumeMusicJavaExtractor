PLAY THE GAME

Shoot the gun off, let the trance set in. You're at it again. You let the fancy flashing colors suck you in. Got to get 'em, before they get to you, or else you're through. Skip to the three bypass two, easy to do. Wo, oh, oh, that things got to go. Wo, oh, oh, shut 'em down, take out the main control. Play the game. Move your fingers, show 'em what you got and what you're not. You got to move that dumb dog before you go get yourself caught. Shoot the gun off (bang, bang). Shoot the gun off (bang, bang). You gotta get yourself up before all is lost.
