RUMOR WEED

Have you heard the one about alfred
a dangerous robot i'm told
he's got lasers for eyes
and a microchip brain
and his skin is terribly cold

(We've heard the one about alfred! its strange! amazing! untrue!)
but now that we heard about alfred
we'd like to hear more about you

I'm a rumor weed
(he's a rumor weed)
I'm a rumor weed
(he's a rumor weed)
A tiny little story is all i need to make a big mess
( he's a rumor weed)

(So what is a rumor)
Starts as a story
maybe it's true, maybe not
but once you repeat it
it's hard to defeat it
now look at the mess that you've got

Alfred's a robot
everyone knows
the story is all over town
Us rumor weeds know how a rumor can grow
just like a big weed in the ground

I'm a rumor weed
( he's a rumor weed)
I'm a rumor weed
(he's a rumor weed)
A tiny little story is all i need to make a big mess
(he's a rumor weed)

Don't start a rumor
no no
Don't start a rumor
words can hurt; they spread like a tumor
so play it safe and don't start a rumor

I'm a rumor weed
(he's a rumor weed)
I'm a rumor weed
(he's a rumor weed
A tiny little story is all i need to make a big mess

A tiny little story is all i need
(Better watch out for the rumor weed!)
