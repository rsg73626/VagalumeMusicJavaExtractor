JASON E.

Jason E strutting on by the presby. The way you walk, you slur your talk, can you tell me. How could you choose the road you did, the walls behind which you hid. Who do you blame, who should take the fall, not me. Is it a situation can you really get out. Have your goals in life left you ripped off. Without a reason, without a direction. Void of motivation, leaves many in hesitation to lend a helping hand or even a firm place to stand. Jason E how would it be to see what you see. A new day, unsuspecting prey, can you help me. Decision one leads to another. Zero impact on your future or so it seems then there go your dreams, what now. Is it a situation can you really get out. Have your goals in life left you ripped off. Without a reason, without a direction. Void of motivation, leaves many in hesitation to lend a helping hand or even a firm place to stand.
