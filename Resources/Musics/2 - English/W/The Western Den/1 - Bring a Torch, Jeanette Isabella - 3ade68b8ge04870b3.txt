BRING A TORCH, JEANETTE ISABELLA

Bring a torch, jeanette isabella
Bring a torch, come swiftly and run
Christ is born! Tell the folk of the village
Jesus is sleeping in his cradle
Hush, hush
Beautiful is the mother
Hush, hush
Beautiful is her son

It is wrong when the child is sleeping
It is wrong to talk so loud
Silence all as you gather around
Lest your noise should waken Jesus

Hush, hush
See how fast he slumbers
Hush, hush
See how fast he sleeps
