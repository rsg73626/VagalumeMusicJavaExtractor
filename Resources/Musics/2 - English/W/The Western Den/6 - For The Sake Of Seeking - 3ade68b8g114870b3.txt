FOR THE SAKE OF SEEKING

Sought it out
Coveting the mind to mend your stifling doubt
Plummet down
Fast as you can before your trials run out
You're running out

The eastern sky pours through your window
Your heart is nigh; just wait for the sign
The fire feels better when the sun has set
Desire feels better when you know you're next to
The one in which you shall abide
Not I
Not I

Oh, don't waste your time
Oh, don't chase your plight
Oh, don't brave your might
Oh, don't burn out your light
For mine

Through darkness, brave the mountains, there you climb
Wayfaring one, you've wandered past your guide
Alas, you'll see what you believe is the end of darker days
I've become the keeper of the inn
The home that turned you away
