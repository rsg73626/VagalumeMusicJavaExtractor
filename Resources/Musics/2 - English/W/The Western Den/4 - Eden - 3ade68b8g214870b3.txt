EDEN

Oh, this kingdom is not for the dwellers
There's no vacancy for the other side of me
And I know not how to remain frozen here
Oh, I hunger for more than he's chosen, I fear

Come my child, my remedies will ease you
Near the top of my tree, come find rest within me
I bear fruits not of seeds that your father has sown
Be gratified like the rest of us, you'll never feel alone
Serpents, they soothe in hiding
No thoughts, no path, no fighting
Peacefully preying on poor and prudent minds

Born from the bones of my lover
Yet I'm bound to another
Heeding towards evil's eye
I'm changing this garden for my brothers, as I follow my hunger
Gaining nothing but how to survive

I'll never find home again
I'll never find home again
I'll never find home again
I'll never find home again

I am one with the beasts now
We are begging for the sea
Run, run, run for the darkness
Because the light's turned on me
Lift your eyes from your flowers now
There's nothing left to see
Oh, my husband, almighty king, have you forsaken me?
