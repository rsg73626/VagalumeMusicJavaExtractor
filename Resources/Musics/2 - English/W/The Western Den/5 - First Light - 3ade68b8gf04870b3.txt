FIRST LIGHT

The morn came down and fought to promise brighter days
But the dark, it filled the land he'd known
And no promise could be made
Some died for their kin; some, they died alone
Motionless and even now is darkness' perfect home

Darkness drowns
Leave me drowned

We mourn our morning's loss and alter now our gaze
For we cannot see the garden's glow
Nor the night between our days
Hear our desirous hearts calling out in pain
To rid ourselves of darkened homes
and seek the morn again

Darkness drowns
Leave me drowned

Though the dark will seek your ransomed hands
He knows the tide has blown his ship, come in
The beacon shines

The morn came down and fought to promise brighter days
Though the dark, it stayed a little while
The morn, it soon became
