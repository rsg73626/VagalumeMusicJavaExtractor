O COME, O COME, EMMANUEL

O come, o come, emmanuel
And ransom captive israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, o israel

O come, thou rod of jesse, free
Thine own from satan's tyranny
From depths of hell thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, o israel

O come, thou day-spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, o israel
