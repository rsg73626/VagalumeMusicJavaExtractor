CARTER HALL

We got married on a saturday in june
Stole out before my father protested
Too young, too soon
A suitcase filled, left by the door
And a prayer to run astray
Our love is more than I'd hoped for
In you, I'll hide away

With the apples strewn about our feet
Carried out our plan to roam
That's when we conquered carter hall
Claimed her fortress for our own
A year has gone since our wedding song
Was played by your mother's bow
New life grows within my body
The seed planted we'll sow
A baby girl with her mother's curls
A mind brighter than the stars
A beauty born in carter hall
The fruit of youthful hearts

With the shenandoah around our toes
We shall never go astray
And we'll be governing o'er carter hall
Til our baby flies away
If I could make a map
All roads would lead to you
This is our little life, our little life
If we could go back, I would never change a thing
For alone, I am the winter
Love, you are the spring

With our wrinkled hands, we reach for the others'
Just like younger days
Reminiscence built within the walls
We'd never dare erase
Our castle still stands mighty
Just as it's always been
Our love was found in carter hall
You the king and I, your queen

With the mountains climbing higher still
And the moon to light our way
We'll be governing o'er carter hall
Though our souls are old and grey
We'll be governing o'er carter hall
Until our dying day
