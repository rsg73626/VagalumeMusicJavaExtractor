FLOODPLAIN

All spring I was driving
Every river swollen with rain, every stream a torrent
Over the highway bridges
that run high across the plains, flooded
"Half of the Maritimes, " they say, "is running this way"

I don't expect your love to be like mine
I trust you to know your own mind As I know mine

Could it really be so effortless
All in my sight, many hillsides
Green and black and distant
And rivers serpentine, glinting

I know there's so much it just can't mean you and me
Still caught up in heartache and grief
Yet to come, yet to cease

I feel like I'm seeing double, all joy and all trouble
My friends say, "be careful or "be gracious, "
"glad, or thoughtful"
"don't move too fast"; "don't let it pass you by"

But I don't expect your love to be like mine
I trust you to know your own mind As I know mine
