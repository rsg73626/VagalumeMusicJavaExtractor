LEFT ALONE

Standing next to this empty grave
Waiting for the interment
Black clouds still circle the sky
And I wonder if we will see again.

I remember those sleepless nights I had
Just can't erase the reality from my head
I watched you just walk away
Heart is racing, please turn the page.

Walking the streets we used to pass by
To say each other "live for today, hope for tomorrow"
And now you're gone! Now you're gone!
Just put the last red rose on the grave.
