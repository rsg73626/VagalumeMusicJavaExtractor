ABANDONED SHIP

Put the key in, start the engine
Now I'm on my way to no man's land
Feeling so betrayed, feeling sort of injured
By apparently wishing best coldness.

The chapter is closed everything is broken like
When we used to kick bottles through our streets.
So many times I thought life would be that perfect

When we raced with our toycars
Through our streets but now I'm gone.
Feeling like a fish who forgot to swim.
