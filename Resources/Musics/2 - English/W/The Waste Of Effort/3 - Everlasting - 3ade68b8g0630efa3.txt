EVERLASTING

Have you ever see me wasting a tear?
Have you ever felt the same like me?
Inside of me there's so much hope
But no more place for fear.

You will never see me falling down
I will always try to reach all goals
No matter what, no matter how.

I'll never break down
I'll never give up
I'll stand strong to stay on course

Cursing for things went wrong
Mistakes are motivation to move on
I never look back just ahead.
Remember. I'll never look back just ahead.

My life's a challenge and I'm willing to win
Regretting wasted years will never change a thing
Keeping these words always alive
Hope will rise.

You will never see me falling down
I will always try to reach all goals
I will always be like the rising sun
No matter what, no matter how.
Stay alive.
