BLANK EYES

Everything seems to be so good for you
No worries, no hate just love and life
Perfect world, perfect times
Colours everywhere and blindness too.

Sun rised as every day but something has changed
Before the sky did ever clear I saw the clouds rush from hills
But you walk your fields as every day
Like there would be no change.

You just see the walls but not what is behind
You build your muscles not your fucking head
Here are your eyes, cleaned them for you.
Here's your mind, fucked up as before.
