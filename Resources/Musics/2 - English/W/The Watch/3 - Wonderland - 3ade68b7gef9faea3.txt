WONDERLAND

Bright lights and street signs
Wonderland
And the cash tills pray
Shooting fish you are
Shot downs from the stars
Bargaining with good buys
Time not mine
Preacher man preach
Drowning men you are
Drowning at the bar 

Chain reaction on the razor’s edge
Sugar babes and dirty fairy cakes
So much sweatness
Merry gentleman
Overflowing
(in a world full of hate)
But let’s party
Anyway

Spheres of gold, silver stars
So familiar
From year to year
Hear me shoppers 
I can tell you
Spinning wheels in motion
Helping me to feel
There’s a promise I can keep for you
I could sell you
That dream so cool

This empty blue sphere 
Falls through time
And the faithful pay
Shooting stars through space
Shot down from on high
Big fat hole in the sky
Hurtling grace
Drown out the pain
So familiar
So spectacular

Chain reaction o the razor’s edge
Sugar babes and dirty fairy cakes
So much sweatness
Merry gentleman
Overflowing
(in a world full of hate)
Land of planty
(we could do with less)
But let’s party
Anyway

You’ve heard this before
So familiar
From year to year
Stated mildly
To say the least
Empty spheres
Spinning world
Help us to see
That great big hole inside me
The stuff we’ll need
The void we feel

The misguided few
An unlikely crew
As the night comes down
Falling to save
Even you

And so it goes
