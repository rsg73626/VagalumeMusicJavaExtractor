DAMAGE MODE

Johnny's thinking now better now than then
The greatest night with
the man goes to him
he saw the creepy shape
didn't see the angry ape
didn't see passion and the burning flame

Don't deny rage, hate and confusion
watching that perfect movie play
In the back of his mind colours corne to life
An image of
Lara's long white legs standing in front of his face
Ready to run now
Lion moving in for the kill
Lara's long white legs standing in front of his face
Real as she can be

Johnny's breathing air for the last time
The quiet and still air of by gone days
The snapshot of that man
Standing in front of his gaze
Was torn away by white streams of pain

Consumed by rage, hate and destruction
watching that perfect movie play
In the back of his mind colours fade to grey
an image of

Lara's long white legs standing in front of his face
Ready to run now
Lion moving in for the kill
Lara's long white legs standing in front of his face
Real as she can be

Johnny wore a uniform
He was young and his life was a game
No paradise no virgins waitinh for him tonight
Lara will not cry for him
Other players will play another game
No white legs of faces wait in his bed tonight
Lara's long white legs open in front of his gaze
Easy to die for
Lion moving in for the kill
Lara's long white legs stretching in front of his fate
Real as she can be
