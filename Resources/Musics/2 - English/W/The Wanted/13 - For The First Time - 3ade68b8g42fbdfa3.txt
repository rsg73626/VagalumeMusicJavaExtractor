FOR THE FIRST TIME

She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how, how we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how, 
how we got into this mess is it a God's test
Someone help us cause we're doing our best
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah

We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

For the first time OOH

She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job I didn't lose my pride
And we both know how, 
How we're going make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah

Smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

For the first time OOH

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while

We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

For the first time OOH

Oh these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
