BEHIND BARS

I feel something over me
And try to run away
From the demons that haunted me

The key turns inside
No place to hide
I'm locked in no place
No place

I think I could be goin' crazy
Goin' crazy
Feelin' the walls come closer
Body's colder
Because I'm behind bars
Because I'm behind bars

Now a whisper's calling me
(calling me,calling me)
And why does my skin crawl with the
pain of insanity

The key turns inside
No place to hide
I'm locked in no place
No place

I think I could be goin' crazy
Goin' crazy
Feelin' the walls come closer
Body's colder
Because I'm behind bars
Because I'm behind bars

Let me out of here
I need somebody please

I think I could be goin' crazy
Goin' crazy
Feelin' the walls come closer
Body's colder
Because I'm behind bars
Because I'm behind bars
Behind bars
