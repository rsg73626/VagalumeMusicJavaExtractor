BRING IT HOME

We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
We are, we are, we are, we are the only ones

This is an invasion,
The unwanted kind
I'm all about domination
That's my state of mind

I'm gonna build an empire
So what's yours is mine
We're gonna take it home tonight
Oh oh oh ohh

Lets make this one to remember
We're blowing up the sky like the fifth of November
We don't stop cuz we're impatient
The anticipation is pumpin, pumpin, pumpin

Carry the light
From the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die
We're crossing the light
There's no where left to hide

Tell me what you waiting for
What you living for
We're bringing it home
Oh oh ohhh
No one's left behind
You're not alone

Cuz we are, we are,
We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
Cuz we are, we are,
We are, we are the only ones

When I'm gone will you miss me?
We'll find out in time
I'm gonna go down in history
As the one who changed your mind
They said that I'm dangerous
So what's yours is mine
We're gonna take this home tonight
Oh oh oh oh

Lets make this one to remember
We're blowing up the sky like the fifth of November
We don't stop cuz we're impatient
The anticipation is pumpin, pumpin, pumpin

Carry the light
From the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die
We're crossing the light
There's no where left to hide

Tell me what you waiting for
What you living for
We're bringing it home
Oh oh ohhh
No one's left behind
You're not alone

Cuz we are, we are,
We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
Cuz we are, we are,
We are, we are the only ones

Right here where you're meant to be
I'm gonna get my hands on you officially
I swear life's a bitch
And mine's called victory
That's why I always come first literally

There ain't another like your kind
All eyes on the prize but you're mine
Never give up on something 
You can't go a day without thinking about

Just carry the light
From the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die
We're crossing the line
There's no where left to hide

Tell me what you waiting for
What you living for
We're bringing it home
Oh oh ohhh
No one's left behind
You're not alone

Cuz we are, we are,
We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
Cuz we are, we are,
We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
