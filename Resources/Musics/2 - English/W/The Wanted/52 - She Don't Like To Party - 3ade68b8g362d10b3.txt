SHE DON'T LIKE TO PARTY

This is not gonna last forever
It's that time when you must hold on
And I won't let you surrender
And I'll heal you if you're broken

We can stand so tall together
We can make it through the stormy weather
We can go through it all together, do it all together, do it all

I'll be your strength
I will, I will, I will
I'll be your strength
Yes I will, yes I will

I won't sleep till the sky is calmer
Keep on searching till I find you
And my love will be your armor
In this battlefield around you

Hand in hand we will walk together
We can make it through the stormy weather
We can break down walls together, do it all together, do it all

I'll be your strength
I will, I will, I will
I'll be your strength
Yes I will, yes I will

Hold on, hold on
I'll be, there soon
So hold on, hold on
I'll be, there soon
So hold on, hold on
I'll be, there soon
So hold on, hold on
I'll be, there

I'll be your strength
I will, I will be
I'll be your strength
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your strength
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your strength
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your strength
I'll be strong for you
I'll be your strength
And I'll keep strong for you
