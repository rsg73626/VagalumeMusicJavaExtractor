ROCKET

You think you see me
You haven't seen nothing
I'm looking for some more than this
I'm feeling no limits
I'm seizing each minute

Don't wanna, don't wanna just exist
Don't want my feet on the ground
Wanna feel the speed of sound
I want it now

I wanna fly
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop til I feel the sky at my feet,
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying, flying high

I'm climbing, I'm rising
I'm striking like lightning
Writing my name in sky writing for all to see
I'll do something epic
And they won't forget it
Good enough's not good enough for me

I want the ride of my life
Want to reach the speed of light
Want it tonight

I wanna fly
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop til I feel the sky at my feet,
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying, flying high

Never gonna make my way down
I'll make the galaxy my playground

It's gonna be one hell of a ride
I'll fly

Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop till I feel the sky at my feet,
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying, flying high
