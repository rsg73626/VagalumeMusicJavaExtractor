REPLACE YOUR HEART

You know I never want to hurt you
I don't know why I'd ever want to
Oh oh oh

There's no comfort in another face
So are you gonna let it go to waste
Oh oh oh

I keep on tryin'
But how can I buy in
When they don't compare to you
No oh

I'm running out of patience
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart

Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder
How we're so far apart

I'm tired of imitations
Running out of patience
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart

Must be crazy if I let you go
You were everything I need to know
Come back home
Feel like I'm dying
Cause I keep on finding
Every junction leads to here
And I'm lost

I'm running out of patience
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart

Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder
How we're so far apart

I'm tired of imitations
Running out of patience
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart

Everywhere I turn
Is the wrong direction
Everyone I see is the wrong reflection
Reminding me that I just
Can't replace your heart

I'm running out of patience
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart

Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder
How we're so far apart

I'm tired of imitations
Running out of patience
Tryin? to replace
Replace your heart

I've been through the crowds
Call your name out loud
But there's still no way to
Replace you

I've looked everywhere
Everywhere everywhere
To replace your heart
To replace your heart
