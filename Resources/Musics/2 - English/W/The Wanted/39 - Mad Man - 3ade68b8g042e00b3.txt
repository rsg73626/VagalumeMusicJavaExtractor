MAD MAN

Oh, I'll let go,
I'll fight for you until I drop
So get ready,
My love is steady
It won't slow
And it won't stop

Maybe I'm a mad man
Maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
But you won't see a sad man
When you're looking at me

They can call me crazy
But what good is a life behind the door,
And I've been living lately
When you're looking at me

Oh, I'll let go,
I'll fight for you until I drop
So get ready,
My love is steady
It won't slow
And it won't stop

It's like my nerves are set on fire
It's like a fuse growing in my brain
The sun is rising and we're not tired
We'll be dancing on for days

Maybe I'm a mad man
Maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
But you won't see a sad man
When you're looking at me

And I feel so amazing
We're vibing on a higher atmosphere
And you can call me crazy
But it's so beautiful from here

Oh, I'll let go,
I'll fight for you until I drop
So get ready,
My love is steady
It won't slow
And it won't stop

It's like my nerves are set on fire
It's like a fuse growing in my brain
The sun is rising and we're not tired
We'll be dancing on for days

It's like my nerves are set on fire
It's like a fuse growing in my brain
The sun is rising and we're not tired
We'll be dancing on for days

And I feel so amazing
We're vibing on a higher atmosphere
And you can call me crazy
But it's so beautiful from here
