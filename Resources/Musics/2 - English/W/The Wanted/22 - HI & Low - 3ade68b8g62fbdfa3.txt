HI & LOW

I'm gonna see some friends
From outta state
I've already dreamt that's you
Was supposed to take a while ago
But it fell through
Like all of you Llike all of you

Thought I'd make the drive
But a free plane ride
Is in the air
Just like that my fear of it disappeared
Like all of you like all of you

And I'm High and Low
For yesterday
High and Low
For you and I
High and Low

Once I can see straight I might move
Somewhere cold
Seattle or the Bay area
To see your gold
What's left of you what's left of you

And I'm High and Low
For yesterday
High and Low
For you and I
High and Low

Found a letter from a man.
A modern man
Addressed to you
And now I steal the words
He ended with
I miss you
And I do
Miss you
And I do

High and Low
For yesterday
High and Low
For you and I
High and Low
