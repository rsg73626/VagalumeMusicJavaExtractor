LAST TO KNOW

Words travel fast,
So you spend all your time in your head,
What’s the point in that?
Cause words never last,
What you say now it’s not what you said.
And I’m okay with that.

You’re keeping yourself tide up,
So you won’t let me down
Didn’t you ever think, just maybe

I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re headed down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Don’t let me be the last to know, yeah
Don’t let me be the last to know

You take all I have,
Steal all for you with half-empty glass,
What’s the point in that?
And all I ever ask
Is that you tell me when it’s not enough,
Cause if it’s real love

I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re headed down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Don’t let me be the last to know

And maybe you’ll find what you really wanted
Cause what you left behind and all your dreams are hauntin’
Maybe I’ll move on, or maybe I’ll just stay
Either way…
I hope you’ll understand me
If I say we can’t be
So if you wanna go
I want you to know

I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re headed down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Don’t let me be the last to know, yeah
Don’t let me be the last to know
Don’t let me be the last to know
