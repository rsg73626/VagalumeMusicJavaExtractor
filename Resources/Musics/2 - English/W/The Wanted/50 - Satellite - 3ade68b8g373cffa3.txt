SATELLITE

Baby, come over here,
I just gotta tell you something, something,
There's nothing left to fear,
There's nothing that can hurt you, nothing,
We can take on the bodies of angels,
Away from everyone,
Touch as we circle the world, you and me,
On the run.

So put your hands up to the sky,
You put them up, follow me,
If you wanna' fly, I'll show you love,
Put your hands up to the sky, it's not a mile,
When we touch, we get so high,
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Baby, hold on tight

Look at the stars above,
We're the only thing that's brighter, brighter,
Tonight you can feel the love,
The way I feel around you, lighter.
We can take on the bodies of angels,
Away from everyone,
Touch as we circle the world you and me,
On the run.

So put your hands up to the sky,
You put them up, follow me,
If you wanna' fly, I'll show you love,
Put your hands up to the sky, its not a mile,
When we touch, we get so high,
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love,
Baby, hold on tight

The way I feel around you, lighter
The way I feel around you
Baby, hold on tight,
Baby, hold on tight,

Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Baby, hold on tight
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now,
Baby, hold on tight.
