THE WEEKEND

I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I'm gonna see your face again.

Come here right now girl,
I'll make you sweat like you've worked out,
Then we'll down a drink or two,
You won't know what I'll put you through.

I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I'm gonna see your face again.

Let's get down and some more.
Then we'll take it to the floor.
So make your body close to mine,
Girl you're looking fine.
Now for the last time...

I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I'm gonna see your face again.

Come here right now girl,
I'll make you sweat like you've worked out,
Then we'll down a drink or two,
You won't know what I'll put you through.

I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I'm gonna see your face again.
I know I'm gonna see your face again.
