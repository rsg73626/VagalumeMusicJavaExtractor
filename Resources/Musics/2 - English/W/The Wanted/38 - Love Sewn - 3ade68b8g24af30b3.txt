LOVE SEWN

Yeah we fell we fell so hard we sold out
Yeah we fray and fade away
We never cut loose there's nobody but you
Nobody else (nobody else)

Yeah we feel we feel all of the same thing
You find you find all of my secrets
Locked up deep inside of me
I know you're always right
Always right

So save your words
I'm bleeding inside
You see the hurt, no where left to hide
And all this time, you're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing that I'll mess it up again
Now I don't recognize just what we used to be
And I can see us tearing at the seams

We cover up the scars, and never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
(This love is sewn)

Yeah we try, we try to leave them behind
All our mistakes, we stumble though a million fights
Every time we twist the knife
We forgive never forget, never forget

So save your words
I'm bleeding inside
You see the hurt, no where left to hide
and all this time, your slipping away from me
bring me to my knees

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
torn apart and knowing that I'll mess it up again
Now I don't recognize just what we used to be
and I can see us tearing at the seams

We cover up the scars, and never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
(This love is sewn)

Yeah we fell we fell so hard we sold out
Yeah we fray and fade away
We never cut loose, there's nobody but you
Nobody else

Now I'm lying on the floor
with no one else to blame
torn apart and knowing that I'll mess it up again
Now I don't recognize just what we used to be
and I can see us tearing at the seams

We cover up the scars, and never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
(This love is sewn)
