INVINCIBLE

Tonight could be forgettable
Cause I'm drinking all the alcohol
Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cold
Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Tonight I feel invincible

Tonight I feel invincible
Just please don't tell the principle
The feeling's irresistible
In detention getting physical

Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Tonight I feel invincible

Tonight I feel unstoppable
And anything is possible
We are uncontrollable
We don't do predictable

Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Cause I like it like that

Tonight could be forgettable
Cause I'm drinking all the alcohol
Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cool
Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Tonight I feel invincible
