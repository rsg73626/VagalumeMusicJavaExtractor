DAGGER

Stay
Won't beg you to stay
Go, yeah, I'll be ok
Won't kill me this way
Oh, oh
At least that's what I'll say
No, you don't have to know
The wounds that hurt me the most
Cos I'll never show
Just how deep they go

That's why I'm telling you
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart

Strong, I thought I was strong
These scars will heal before long
I guess I was wrong
Oh, oh
And I'm too far gone
Try, I know I should try
To just get on with my life
But it's slipping away tonight
There's some loves you can't survive

That's why I'm telling you
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart

The last words I would say
Is there ain't anyone else
Can take this pain away

That's why I'm telling you
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart

Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
