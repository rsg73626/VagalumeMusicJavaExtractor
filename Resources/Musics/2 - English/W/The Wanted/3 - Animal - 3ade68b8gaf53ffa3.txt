ANIMAL

Here we go again...
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me, I'm afraid
You're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals,we play pretend
You're just a cannibal, and I'm afraid
I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight...

Whoa ohh.. I want some more
Whoa ohh... what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa ohh.. I want some more
Whoa ohh... what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Here we are again
We feel the chemicals kicking in
It's getting heavy and
I wanna run and hide,
I wanna run and hide

I do it every time, it's killing me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Whoa ohh.. I want some more
Whoa ohh... what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa ohh.. I want some more
Whoa ohh... what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Hush hush...the world is quiet
Hush hush...we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess,
Why can't you understand?
Oh I won't sleep tonight
