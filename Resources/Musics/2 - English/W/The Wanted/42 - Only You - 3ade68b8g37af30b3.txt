ONLY YOU

How can I hold a mirror up to your eyes
Speak the way you can understand what's inside
You have been broken down
In a thousand different ways
I've been looking over pictures
And you hardly looked the same
I can see it from a mile
That the way you smile is changed
But you don't know
It is hard for me to sit and watch you getting sick
When all I wanna do is try

Only you
Can dig yourself out just before you break down girl
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck
All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up now just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time

Beautiful that's the only way I see you
Nobody else can love you in the way that I do
Sometimes I get worried that you are taking up too much
And this crazy world where we live in
Doesn't really give a fuck
If only we could paddle to a place
When it was just you and I
It is hard for me to sit and watch you getting sick
When all I wanna do is try

Only you
Can dig yourself out just before you break down girl
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck
All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up now just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time
You can run out of time

Lalalalala
Lalalala
Lalalala
(You can run out of time)
Lalalala
Lalalala

Only you
Can dig yourself out just before you break down girl
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck

All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up now just before you run out of time

Before you run out of time
Before you run out of time
