OUT OF TIME (JAY MCGUINESS)

How can I hold a mirror up to your eyes?
Speak the way you can understand what's inside
You've been broken down in a thousand different ways
I've been looking over pictures and you hardly look the same
I can see it from a mile that the way your smile is changed
But you don't know
It's hard for me to sit and watch you getting sick 
when all I wanna do is try

Only you can dig yourself out just before you break down, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck, yeah
If all of this pain spread all over your face
All I wanna do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up know just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time

Beautiful, that's the only way I see you
Nobody else can love you in the way that I do
Sometimes I got worry that you've taken on too much
And this crazy world we live doesn't really give a fuck
If only we could paddle to a place when it was just you and I
Is hard for me to sit and watch you getting sick 
when all I wanna do is try
Only you can dig yourself out just before you break down, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck, yeah
If all of this pain spread all over your face all
I wanna do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up now just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time

You could run out of time
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You could run out of time
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You could run out of time

Only you can dig yourself out just before you break down, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck, yeah
Only you can dig yourself out just before you break down, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up just before you get stuck, yeah
If all of this pain spread all over your face all
I wanna do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up now just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time
