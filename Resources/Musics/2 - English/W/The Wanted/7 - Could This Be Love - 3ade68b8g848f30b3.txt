COULD THIS BE LOVE

She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?

Staying up 'till late at night
Watching the stars burst into light
Watch movies all the time
We can't get enough

I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up

Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On the ceiling with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love?
Could this be love?

Sat in bed, we're on the phone
Her voice is sweet, she doesn't know
Could stay awake all night long
Could this be love?

Walk together through the night
The sky is clear, the stars are bright
I kiss her lips and hold her tight
Is that enough?

I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up

Let's take a chance this time
Could be the best of our lives
I think you already know

Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On the celing with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?

'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love, love, love?

Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?

She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?

Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On the ceiling with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love, love, love?

Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love, love, love? yeah
Could this be love?
