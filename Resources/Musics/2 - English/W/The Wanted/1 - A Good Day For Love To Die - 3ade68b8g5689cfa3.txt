A GOOD DAY FOR LOVE TO DIE

Seen the change watching it fade
Holding my breath feeling it fail
Working hard wondering why
Can't fix it now so why even try

We've run out of time
It's over I'm over this life
I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life

It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time
To break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die

Not easy to say harder to do
But that's no kinda life
So I'll leave it to you

Working it hard wondering why
Can't fix it now so why even try

We've run out of time
It's over I'm over this life
I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life

It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time
To break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die

There's not a chance
There's not a prayer
Can't pull a miracle out of the air
So now I'm leaving letting it lie
Letting it die

We've run out of time
Its over I'm over this life
I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life

It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time
To break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die

For love to die
For love to die
For love to die
For love to die
It's a good day for love for love to die
For love to die
