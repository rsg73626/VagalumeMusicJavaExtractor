I FOUND YOU

She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves I swear the room
Around her lights up like the sky
Confidence like a rockstar

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the star light
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight
Tonight

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your life brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you in the music playing

I was lost
Till I found you, you, you
Till I found you, you, you

The night is getting older
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
I know she feels the same
Cause I can see it in her eyes
She says "Can we start again?"

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the star light
She's moving to the beat of my heart
We were so lost until tonight
Tonight

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your life brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you in the music playing

I was lost
Till I found you, you, you
Till I found you, you, you

I said, people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light
And we all get low, all get low
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I'd given up
Looking for some kind of sign

That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your life brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you in the music playing

I was lost
Till I found you
