TURN IT OFF

(turn it off)

[jay:]
Stop, look, listen what I’m saying
Don’t push, haven’t got to chasing
Just me, I don’t have to fake it
Never gonna change it,
I don’t have to fake it

[tom:]
Back off, back off
You won’t get very far
Back off, back off
I think you think you’re a star
Back off, back off
I don’t know who you are
I think you think you’re a star, you’re a star

[max:]
There’s something about in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’m blacking out of mind so I can’t hear a thing
About to tell you what I mean
Turn it off, turn it off

[siva:]
Fast cars, smooth talk, flash watch (turn it off)
Fake hair, fake tan, lip-gloss (turn it off)
Hot shot, who cares?
‘cause I just don’t give a damn (turn if off, off, turn it off)

[jay:]
Time moves, seems like nothing’s changing
V.I.p. isn’t that amazing?
So, see/scene, but it doesn’t fade me
Never gonna change me
No, it doesn’t faze me

[tom:]
Back off, back off
You won’t get very far
Back off, back off
I think you think you’re a star
Back off, back off
I don’t know who you are
I think you think you’re a star, you’re a star

[max:]
There’s something about in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’m blacking out of mind so I can’t hear a thing
