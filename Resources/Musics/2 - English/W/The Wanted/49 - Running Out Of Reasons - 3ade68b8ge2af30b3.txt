RUNNING OUT OF REASONS

(Oh, you're running out of reasons)

Shut it out, what you heard about
What you heard about me
They say I'm rough or loud
But they don't know nothing
Not a thing about me

So tear up that list of things
You wrote down (wrote down)
Why you can never be with me now (not now)
I know where you wanna be

You wanna say no, no, it ain't gonna work (oh)
But then you fumble your words
Oh, you're running out of reasons
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Just let the fire burn, burn girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
Oh, Oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons

Stand right there
You'll never get nowhere
When you run like you do, like you do
It's no, no fair
I'm sure that your secret's out
Everyone sees right through you

So tear up that list of things
You wrote down (wrote down)
Why you can never be with me now (not now)
I know where you wanna be

You wanna say no, no, it ain't gonna work (oh)
But then you fumble your words
Oh, you're running out of reasons
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Just let the fire burn, burn girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons

Never was, never was a bad time to
Love somebody so love me baby yeah
Never was, never was a better feeling
Than just saying yeah, yeah

You wanna say no, no, it ain't gonna work (oh)
But then you fumble your words
Oh, you're running out of reasons
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Just let the fire burn, burn girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons
(reasons, reasons, reasons, reasons)
