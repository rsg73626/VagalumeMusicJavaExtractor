WE OWN THE NIGHT (THE CHAINSMOKERS REMIX)

May our hearts be full
Like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night

And let us wake up inside a strangers bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night my friends we will not forget
Tonight we own the night

Tonight we own the night

May our hearts be full
Like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night

And let us wake up inside a strangers bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night my friends we will not forget
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

Tonight we own the night

Tonight we own the night

Tonight we own the night
