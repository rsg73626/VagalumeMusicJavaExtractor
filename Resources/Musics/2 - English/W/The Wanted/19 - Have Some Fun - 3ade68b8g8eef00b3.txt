HAVE SOME FUN

All I wanna do is have some fun (Mr. Worldwide)
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one (The Wanted)
All I gotta do is take you ho-o-o-me
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
(Afrojack)
It's all I want (reporting live from the UK)
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
It's all I want
And I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
It's all I want
Baby, it's all I want

You know the type of women that I like
The ones that understand my life
The ones that understand wrong is right
Let's do some wrong tonight
You name it I'll do it, all is the fluid,
I'm Spanish influent,
That means my tongue is bilingual
Ready to play with that spot that you tingle
Uh got a dingo, she's a star, Ringo
Her and 2 friends? Mmm, I like that lingo
She asked if I'm single,
I said of course not, and she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
Hahaha

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
All I gotta do is take you ho-o-o-me
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
It's all I want
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
It's all I want
And I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
It's all I want
Baby
It's all I want

You know I love an open mind
So I can see what you thinking
That way I could give you exactly what you want
Matter of fact what you drinking
Some call it pimping, I call it leverage
I call it slipping, they call it marriage
She got me up like the Eiffel tower
No Paris, momma you can f*ck like the rabbits
But no diamonds, no karats
She asked if I was single, I said of course not
And she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
All I gotta do is take you ho-o-o-me
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
It's all I want
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
It's all I want
And I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
All I gotta do is take you ho-o-o-me
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
It's all I want

I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
It's all I want
I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
It's all I want
Baby it's all I want
Baby It's all I want
Baby it's all I want
Baby it's all I want
