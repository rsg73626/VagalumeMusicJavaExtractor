EVERYBODY KNOWS

I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
But not the kind you look to Hollywood for

No flashing lights or autographs
In fact, people avoid me if they can
I got no fence hanging right outside of my door

And I hear them whispering when I pass
Saying to each other
"is that the man with a broken heart?"
'Cause you tore it apart

And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
Yes, you run away
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you

I got a thousand friends that follow me
Just to read about my misery
I'm popular for reasons that I hate

And I strike up a conversation
Most time a total stranger
Anyone who listens to my fate

But they shake their heads and they walk away
And all I'm left with "is this fame"
And a broken heart
'Cause you tore me apart

And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
Yes, you run away
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you?

Now if I die today would you even come?
Written on my grave will say "here lies someone
With a broken heart
'Cause she tore it apart"

And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
Yes, you run away
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you?

I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
That all the people know, everyone but you
