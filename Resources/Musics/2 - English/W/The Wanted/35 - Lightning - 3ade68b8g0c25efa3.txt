LIGHTNING

You're in control, pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air so I can't speak
Now I know the chase is on
I feel as though my time has come

How many times do I fly through your head spins
Now it's speeding away from the safeplace
Yeah your skin, your touch, the kiss
The rush, too much, and here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning

We touch light 
Like it's our first time
Oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now

Just you and me and the coats in the back room
Learning things they don't teach in the classroom
Now, you're here I  feel the fear
With everything that's oh so clear

I've been addicted to you since the first date
Out of control like a surge of electric
Yeah, your skin, your touch, the kiss
The rush too much, and here you come

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning

We touch light 
Like it's our first time
Oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now

Your skin, your touch, the kiss, too much
Your skin, your touch, and kiss through rush
Your skin, the touch, the kiss, too much
The rush, the rush, the rush, the rush

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning

We touch light 
Like it's our first time
Oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now
