SHOW ME LOVE (AMERICA)

You should've known I love you
Though I'll never say it too much
Maybe you didn't get me
Maybe I'll never know what I done

Now I'm lost in the distance
You're looking me like a stranger
Cause how it looks right now to me
Is it you're scared of the danger

I could've shown you america
All the bright lights in the universe
Could have reached, the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

Yeah it's true you know, we're not perfect
There's a fire inside of me
It means I'll fight for the things that are worth it
If it makes me feel complete
Cause I'm hitting rocks, and I'm taking shots
I'm prepared to lose everything I've got

Now I'm lost in the distance
You're looking me like a stranger
Cause how it looks right now to me
That nothing can save us

I could've shown America
All the bright lights in the universe
Could have reached, the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

Show me love, love
Show me love, love
Show me love, show me show me love
Show me show me love
Show me love

I could've shown America
All the bright lights in the universe
Could have reached, the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

All you had to do was show me love
