IF WE'RE ALRIGHT

I know you can't be sleeping
‘Cause you're not anywhere near me
All the way on the other side
Wish that I could read your mind
I'm kissing on your shoulder
But you don't wanna turn over
You know I'd rather have another fight
Than be a victim of a silent night

You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fault
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright

Did I hurt your feelings?
You should know I don't mean it
Don't disguise it, let it all out
Say it's my fault whatever you like now
Used to talk, used to talk
We could talk about everything
So what's wrong? Let me know
‘Cause I can do anything
I'm no good if your heart breaks
So I'll do whatever it takes

You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright…

Tic, toc, looking at the clock
If we take a minute we can make it all stop
Tic, toc, when we're gonna talk?
Let it out your head, baby
Give me all you got tonight
Let me make it better

You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright

You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright

And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
