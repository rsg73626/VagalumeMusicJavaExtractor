MADE

You could hurt with a word
You could change my life
You could tell me the truth
It would cut like a knife
But I won't let go
But I won't let go
But I won't let go
You could fall, hit the wall
You could lose your way
You could lose, you could bruise
Spend it all in a day
But I won't let go
But I won't let go
But I won't let go

Cos if I had to save someone
I'd still save you
And if I had to pray for someone
I'd pray for you
Cos you know we are...
Made for each other
Can't take that away
Made for each other
Like sunshine and day
Made for each other
I'm here to stay
Cos you know we are
Made for each other
I'm made for you
Made for each other
Like stars and the moon
Made for each other we'll see it through
Cos you know we are made

They could take, they could hate
They could break our hearts
They can try all they want
Never tear us apart
We will not let go
We will not let go
We will not let go

Cos if I had to save someone
I'd still save you
And if I had to pray for someone
I'd pray for you
Cos you know we are...
Made for each other
Can't take that away
Made for each other
Like sunshine and day
Made for each other
I'm here to stay
Cos you know we are
Made for each other
I'm made for you
Made for each other
Like stars and the moon
Made for each other we'll see it through

Cos you know we are made
Made, made, made
Our love it won't fade
Fade, fade, fade
We just gotta be brave
Brave, brave, brave
You know we are made
Made, made, made

Cos you know we are
Made for each other
Can't take that away
Made for each other
Like sunshine and day
Made for each other
I'm here to stay
Cos you know we are
Made for each other
I'm made for you
Made for each other
Like stars and the moon
Made for each other we'll see it through
You know we are made
