GOLDEN

Don't live in black and white do we
It's just another fight to me
If we don't take it on we won't get far
It seems so far away but so close
It's there for us to take when most
Would waste it don't waste it
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames

And it burns but it turns out golden
We loved to dream aloud
With both feet on the ground
But where's the sense in that
We'd never get it back
We'd be wasted we'd be wasted
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames

And it burns but it turns out golden
And went for the sky
And fell down low
And flew too high
But we still survived cos you and I
We turned out Golden
They tore it to pieces
We'll build it again
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but it turns out golden
And went for the sky
And fell down low
And flew too high
But we still survived cos you and I
We turned out Golden
