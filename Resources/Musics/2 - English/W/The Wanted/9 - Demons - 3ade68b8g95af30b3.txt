DEMONS

Hey,
I see a secret in your face
Did someone steal you away?
Is there someone else in my place
I don't like this game
I, I can see the death in your hands
Cause I know the way that you dance
Don't cover up cause it shows
I wish you would

Stop right now what you're doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh yeah
Now I say

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

You have a natural sway
And you know how sweet you taste
But I can't take your flame
Like a bullet through my veins

As you scratch beneath my skin
My resistance crumbling
I cover up but it shows
But I guess you know again

Stop right now what you're doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh yeah
Now I say

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

All this time,
I said all this time
All this time
All this time
All this time
I said all this time
All this time, all this time

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh (all this time)
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
