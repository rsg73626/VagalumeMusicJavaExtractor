READ MY MIND

It's like you lock me down, yeah
Just take a look around you
It's like a fire burning
Burning up inside

How do I find the words to…
To finds the words to show you
Only you can call me out
Out into the crowd

I bet if you could read my mind
You would go and do it all the time
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now

I bet if you could get in my head
And see everything I never said
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now

You're on the other side, yeah
You're just across the line, yeah
And I can feel you reaching
Reaching out for me

How do I find the words to…
To finds the words to show you
Only you can call me out
Out into the crowd

I bet if you could read my mind
You would go and do it all the time
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now

I bet if you could get in my head
And see everything I never said
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now

I bet if you could read my mind
You would go and do it all the time
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now

I bet if you could get in my head
And see everything I never said
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now

I need to know, I need to know now
I need to know, I need to know now
