PERSONAL SOLDIER

Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left

Tell me what's going on
I know there's something on your mind
Can you just open up?
Do you feel 
Like I'm not somebody trying to hurt you?
Know I'd never let that happen
Must be out of their minds

Cause you are the sunshine that makes me day
And I won't let them take that away, hey

I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fight
And if your battles are piling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier

Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left

If life is a battlefield, there's so many dangers
Just when you think it's OK, 
It blows up in your face
And when this road gets harder
You think your luck's run out,
I will find a reserve to take it right back
To where your heart deserves
Cause there is no way 
That I won't put you first

I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fight
And if your battles are piling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier

I'll protect you girl, don't worry

I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fight
And if your battles are piling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier

Left, left, left, right, left
