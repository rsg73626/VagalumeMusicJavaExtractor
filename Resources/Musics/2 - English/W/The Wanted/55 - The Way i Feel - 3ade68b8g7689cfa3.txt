THE WAY I FEEL

Yeah I'm not dead I'm alive
I survived
While falling apart at the seams

Yeah I have grown I'm alone
I have flown
To the far away land of my dreams

Give me a little chance
To show you what I've learned
I will explain the circumstance
In which I have returned

Cos I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I don't wanna break you
Force or complicate you
That is the way that I feel

Yeah it was fate to wait hesitate
Finding some time on our own
They won't believe
That the joy that we need
Was so very far from our home

Give me a little chance
To show you what I've learned
I will explain the circumstance
In which I have returned

Cos I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I'll try to accept you
Love and protect you
That is the way that I feel

We will go on
Like the moon and the sun
Revolving around the earth

Cos I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I'll try to accept you
Love and protect you
That is the way that I feel
