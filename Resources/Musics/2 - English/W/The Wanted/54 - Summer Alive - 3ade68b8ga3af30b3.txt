SUMMER ALIVE

I might have drank too much
Electric heist, I feel the rush
You're my drug, can't get enough
(Oh oh oh oh)

I want to dance until it feels like time, standing still
Forget the world
Just let me in
I feel so
(Oh oh oh oh)

Having the time of my life with you
Keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long

You take me off the sand
And fly me where I want to land
It's like this beat will never end
I feel so
(oh oh oh oh)

Having the time of my life with you
Keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

Having the time of my life with you
Keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

(All night long, under the moonlight)

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long
