IN THE MIDDLE

When I was young
I read stories where princes won
As I grew up
I thought the stories were wrong

But to you girl, I am faithful
I'm falling so hard that is painful
When it hurts I know the feelings are real

I let nothing in the middle, nothing in the middle
Of me and you, of me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

I love the way we fight
And stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

I don't know
How the story of us unfolds
Or if when we're old
We'll still be together at all

But to you girl, I am faithful
I'm falling so hard that is painful
When it hurts I know the feelings are real

I'll let nothing in the middle, nothing in the middle
Of me and you, of me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

I love the way we fight
And stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

When I feel you breathe
In my arms at night
When I feel you breathe
As I hold you tight
I believe we are meant to be
Meant to be, we are meant to be

When I was young
I read stories where princes won
As I grew up
I thought the stories were wrong

I'll let nothing in the middle, nothing in the middle
Of me and you, of me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

I love the way we fight
And stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
