ROCK YOUR BODY

Breathe a sigh and push tonight
Open your eyes and let the light
Take you away, forget the day
The hit makes you fizz something you gotta say

And I can still see the old days in your face
We have grown and we own it all

This is a rave, not a grave
Everyone head to the light
Coz we are not, not afraid
Of pushing the limits tonight

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
Cpr it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight

Take a risk and feel the rush
It's just begun a change in us
Open your mind, your mind, your mind
And don't you be worried about what you'll find

And I can still see the old days in your face
We have grown and we own it all

This is a rave, not a grave
Everyone head to the light
Coz we are not, not afraid
Of pushing the limits tonight

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
Cpr it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight

This is a rave, not a grave
This is a rave, not a grave
We are not, not afraid

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
Cpr it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
Cpr it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
Cpr it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
The dead won't be sleeping
Tonight
