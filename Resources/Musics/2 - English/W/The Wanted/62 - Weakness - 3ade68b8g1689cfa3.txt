WEAKNESS

She aims a smile with the safety off
And she's not afraid to use it
She holds my gaze just long enough
For me to feel like I'm gonna lose it

And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she calls
I'll fall for her every time

Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
She is my weakness, she is my weakness

A look from her is like oxygen
How would I keep breathing without her
She breaks a whole as she looks away
Now my heart ain't beating without her

And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she goes
I'll come for her every time

Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
She is my weakness, she is my weakness

I know it might sound crazy
But I don't wanna let go
Now I don't mind spending every night 
If you don't let go

I know it might sound crazy
But I don't wanna let go
Now I don't mind spending every night 
If you don't let go

Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
She is my weakness, she is my weakness
