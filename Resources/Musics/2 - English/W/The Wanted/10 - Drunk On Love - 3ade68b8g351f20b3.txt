DRUNK ON LOVE

We're drunk on love, so turn the music up
I wanna lose control, we're gonna lose control
We going out tonight, going with no invite
I want to take it all, we're gonna take it all

I'm a lover not a hater
Not a fighter or a player
And I'll party till the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
We could end up anywhere
But that's all part of the rush

When the lights are shining
That's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl I pour my love all over you

We're drunk on love
We're drunk on love

We're drunk on love
We're going till light it up
The fire never ends, this fire never ends
And when tomorrow comes
We're gonna hear those drums
We'll do it all again
Let's do it all again

I'm a lover not a hater
Not a fighter or a player
And I'll party till the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
We could end up anywhere
But that's all part of the rush

When the lights are shining
That's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl I pour my love all over you

We're drunk on love
We're drunk on love

When the lights are shining
That's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl I pour my love all over you

When the lights are shining
That's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl I pour my love all over you

We're drunk on love
We're drunk on love
