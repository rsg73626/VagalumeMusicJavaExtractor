I-540

We got a lot to learn but we’re a whole lot farther a long than where we’ve been before.
And we’re all put together by the hands of God.
But it was you, the piece He used, to keep me from falling apart.
And the truth of it is that we are still just kids.
But we’ll tear the world wide open.
I drove all night; the darkness could not keep me all alone.
You’re sleeping tight but the morning sun and the streets say I’m almost home.
And the truth of it is that we are still just kids.
But we’ll tear the world wide open.
And the truth of it is that we are still just kids.
But we’ll tear the world wide open.
We keep moving forward till we’ve gone too far.
But we left our hearts way back in Arkansas.
And on the phone saying what, oh what is wrong baby.
Oh what, oh what is wrong baby oh yeah
