WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE

All this work means nothing without you
It’s elementary at best
When your voice is the one thing that wakes up the morning
Just lay my heart to rest

It’s water under the bridge
You say it’s gone when it passes here
And you won’t bring it up again, so I won’t bring it up again
It’s water under the bridge
You say it’s gone when it passes here
And I won’t bring it up again

And all of my heroes, they have fallen
But I will not be next
So come whatever may
You think you’re a tough guy
I can't feel heaven anymore

Now conversation’s useless
I’m wasting all my time
You’re not the same person
I remember in my mind
I told my old man not to worry
We all get there someday
It’s all in the journey 
And who you love along the way

Conversation’s useless
I’m wasting all my time
You’re not the same person
I remember in my mind
