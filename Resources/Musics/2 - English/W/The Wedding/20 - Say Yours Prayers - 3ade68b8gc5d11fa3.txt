SAY YOURS PRAYERS

Look at you now just standing there
Like you think you're something
The lights are up
And the crowd is looking your way
Swaying through what you live to say

So go ahead boy,
Give a little taste of hypocrisy
Maybe you'll hear, the blasphemy
Whatever you preach, it isn't in me

You wanna walk with me
Well do ya?
You wanna walk with me
Well if you love me
Then just love me
Don't you give me pretty words
Lend your life down at the altar
Let me see how serious you are

These people talking to me
No more than how their idols
And various poems with lust in their eyes
They crave for more
To hate the place where the court played carnivores
Well, keep your focus
Because today will come
When everyone will give account
for what they've done
Make me proud
Make me proud my son

You wanna walk with me
Well do ya?
You wanna walk with me
Well if you love me
Then just love me
Don't you give me pretty words
Lend your life down at the altar
Let me see how serious you are

Look at this broken world
Look at my children, oh
Look at this broken world
Look at my children, oh
Cause they're angels
Sing to me the love song
Look up!
Say your prayers on the steps of the capital
Look up
Say your prayers on your knees
Look up!
Say your prayers
Look up!
Say your prayers

You want us to be like you always thought He would
And all you seem to accomplish is the opposite

You wanna walk with me
Well do ya?
You wanna walk with me
Well if you love me
Then just love me
Don't you give me pretty words
Lend your life down at the altar
Let me see how serious you are
