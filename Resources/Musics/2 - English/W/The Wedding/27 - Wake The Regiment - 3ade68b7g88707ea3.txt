WAKE THE REGIMENT

It’s never been this cold before,
Now it’s getting to me
Writing my thoughts home to you
Not knowing if i'll ever see your face again, again

So wake the regiment
We’re marching on tonight
This is what we live for, this is what we live for
So wake the regiment
We’re taking back what’s ours
Home is what we die for, home is what we die for

Now memories of yesteryear
They’re enough to get me through just one more time
I’m thinking about you and all the things that you’ve taught me in this life
I’ll remember till I die

So wake the regiment
We’re marching on tonight
This is what we live for, this is what we live for
So wake the regiment
We’re taking back what’s ours
Home is what we die for, home is what we die for
