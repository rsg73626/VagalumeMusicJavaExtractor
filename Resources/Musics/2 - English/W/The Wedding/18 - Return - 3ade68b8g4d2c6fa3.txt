RETURN

This love is like a raging lion
It's a heart of gold
That's given you a place to go.
You try so hard to make it on your own
You've got to understand I'm making myself known.

Come back to the airwaves, burn the ashes
Raise the grave up to the sun.
Sing of Me, sing of My love
Like a bullet from a gun "SHOT" through the airwaves. 
"BANG, BANG"
Raise the dead.
Sing of Me, sing of My love
Like a bullet from a gun.

It's time for me to bring the black back
And capture the songs and take them to the streets.
If we can sing it loud, we might just see it now
We've got to shake the world, we've got to lift our voice.

Come back. Oh - Come back.
