STARING AT THE LIGHT

Redemption is waiting at your doorstep
He is begging you to let him in now
You can put all of it off again
But where's it gonna get you in the end?

The time is now so maybe you should think things out,
Yea, take some time and think about it now.

This is the only chance to do something about it (something about it)
And don't you put it off (cause you can't live without it) (x2)

Cause the time is now

And take your life back with a vengeance
For the first time you cannot have true love

Promise me you'll never sleep again
Cause until you find the answers there's no rest.
To put to death the life you've lived in doubt
I'll show you all the things you've heard about

This is the only chance to do something about it (something about it)
Don't you put it off (cause you can't live without it) (x2)

You are on the verge
Let go
Go on staring at the light 

If you let go and just believe
You won't make a liar out of me
Come try and show me what you see
What I have is what you need

This is the only chance to do something about it (something about it)
And don't you put it off (cause you can't live without it) (x4)

This is the only chance
Don't you put it off (x2)
