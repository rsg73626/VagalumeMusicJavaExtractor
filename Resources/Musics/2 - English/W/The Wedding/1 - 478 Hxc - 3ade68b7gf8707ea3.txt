So I’ll take my chances on the road again
So I’ll take my chances on the road again
So sick and tired of this fighting
We haven’t left camp yet
And wars have broken out on all sides
Whatever happened to loyalty getting the upper hand on jealousy
Take the stand it’s gonna take to change the tide

And as we drive through the night
We’ll be thinking of you
We’ll be thinking of you
As we drive through the night,
We’ll be thinking of you
We’ll be thinking of you

Well I wish that these feet would grow roots
Become a part of this ground
So I’d have somewhere to belong
And as the sun rises above the battlefield where brothers fell
I promise it won’t end for me that way

And each other is all that we have left
They can't take that away
