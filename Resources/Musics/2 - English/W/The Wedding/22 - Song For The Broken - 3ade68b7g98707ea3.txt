SONG FOR THE BROKEN

Don’t give up on the hope
That keeps you breathing
Cause after all is said and done
It’s all your lonely heart has
So look forward to your day of liberation
When you can stop grieving

So how much would it cost for you to gain everything
Everything you lost deserved to be gone anyway
So don’t give up, yeah, don’t give in
To the world around you that pressures you
To give up the fight, roll over and die
Forget the way you were
Song for the broken

So how much pain could you take 
before you gave up
would you throw it all away
would you fight for that one day
when you heard your Savior say
when you heard your Savior say
my child I always knew you'd make it home
so walk through those gates of gold and claim your throne

So I wait for you to save me
So I wait for you to save me
Still I wait for you
To lift me off the ground and 
Still I wait for you in the dark of the night
Cause I won’t give up the fight
Still I wait for you in the dark of the night
Still I wait for you, again
Still I wait for you, again
Cause in the dark of the night is where you’ll find me
Head held in my hands is where,
Still I wait for you

To lift me off my feet and 
Still I wait for you in the dark of the night
Cause I won’t give up give up the fight
Still I wait for you in the dark of the night
Still I wait for you, again
Still I wait for you, again
Cause in the dark of the night is where you’ll find me
Head held in my hands is where,
Still I wait for you
