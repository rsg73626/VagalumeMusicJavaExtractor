THIS ONE'S FOR YOU

You gotta get, get over yourself a little,
to see the grass is green.
You gotta get, get over yourself a little
to see the grass is green.

You make this so worthwhile,
you get better by the mile.
Even when it tears you apart,
you do your best not to show it.

Its me that you can do without,
but you chose to stick it out.
And without you there is no doubt.
I would break under the burden

You gotta get, get over yourself a little,
to see the grass is green.
You gotta get, get over yourself a little,
to see the grass is green.

You try, so hard
And I am so self involved,
yeah I am so typical,
you could call my every move now baby.

But your a mid summers dream,
you are so pristine.
And in the end everything you do
is just for me.

You gotta get, get over yourself a little,
to see the grass is green.
you gotta get, get over yourself a little,
to see the grass is green.

You try so hard
why do you even bother with me
Told me what isn't you see (Just try)
Why do you even bother with her.

So put on your dancing shoes,
because this beat is for you.
Grab your rhythm and,
fill all perfectly through.

Its the least I could do,
after what we've been through.
I wrote these words cause I love you,
only you.

You gotta get, get over yourself alittle,
to see the grass is green.
You gotta get, get over yourself alittle,
to see the grass is green.

You tried,
why do you even bother with me.
Told me what isnt what you see, (Just try)
Why do you even bother with her.
Just Try...
Just Try...
