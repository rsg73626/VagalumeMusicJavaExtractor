PRICE FOR LOVE

The lights go out in my corner of the world
tonight
And so do the lights in your eyes
Yeah so did the lights in your eyes
Now I don't want to preach at you, I just care
too much
To let you walk away from this

And he died so never forget, forget his love
Yeah he died, to show us, the price you pay for love

I never said that this would be easy
In fact it's the hardest thing that you will ever do
But I don't worry they will never capture you
You've already been set free from this

So right your wrongs and make your amends
We are running out of time
This is our song that we sing from the mountain
Can you hear it, can you hear it
This is your song that we sing to you
can you hear me, can you hear me
