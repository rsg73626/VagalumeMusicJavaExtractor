REBOUND

(Wonder why) Wonder why,
and push all the questions to the back of your mind

You try and try to figure out

(What this life's about when) 
What this life's about,
And when the pain will end
And when we can start again

Chorus:
Not enough time to try for a rebound
look over and over it from the top down
pick pick pick pick pick pick it up,
not giving up thats true love x2

Oh heart of gold, your angel falling into my world unannounced
And try and try to figure out
(Figure out where I went wrong)
Where I went wrong and confused, 
This pain with pleasure
What more is there to think about

(Chorus)

We thought we were close to reaching the prize,
but we gouge out our eyes at the terrible sight,
As our dreams crash and burn before our eyes,
The mother that stayed made a sacrifice,
So the family was loved, putting herself aside
but it always seemed that part of her died

(Chorus) (Not giving, Not giving, Not giving up)
