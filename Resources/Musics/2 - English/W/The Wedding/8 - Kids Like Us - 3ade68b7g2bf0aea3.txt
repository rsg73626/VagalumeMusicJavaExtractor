KIDS LIKE US

I'll see you in the morning at the break of daylight
But if you wake up and I'm gone I'll see you on the other side

Late nights talking, we stood by the window by ourselves
Remembering the starry nights and wishing they would be ours
And now we wonder, what happened to those times
'Cause I'd give anything to have you here, tonight

When you're kids like us you do whatever
Whatever it takes
To get to where we are now

Nothing holds you back, when you're kids like us
Chasing our dreams and living life for every second
Nothing holds you back, when you're kids like us
So chase your dreams, and live your life for every second
