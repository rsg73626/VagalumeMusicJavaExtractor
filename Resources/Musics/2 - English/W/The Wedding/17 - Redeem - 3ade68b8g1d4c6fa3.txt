REDEEM

The strong winter storm
As it blows from the north
Brings danger to our bones.
But with careful retreat 
As careful can be
We might just make it home.

But try as we may, Your love always remains
And we cannot afford to be afraid anymore.

Let's stay the course and hold on tight.
Jesus Christ Satellites are calling
A-O, We're not alone.

As we brace for the sound 
Of the deafening crowd
Screaming "Lord, have mercy now",
I hear the words of my King 
As they echo underneath
"My hand awaits, rise to your feet".

But die as we may, Your love always remains
And we cannot afford to be afraid anymore.

Let's stay the course and hold on tight.
Jesus Christ Satellites are calling
A-O, We're not alone.
