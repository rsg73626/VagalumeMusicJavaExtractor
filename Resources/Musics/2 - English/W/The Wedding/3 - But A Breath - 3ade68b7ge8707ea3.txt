BUT A BREATH

One shot is all you’ve got
To make your mark, to make your difference
One chance, but you don’t understand this

LA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA LA
Life is but a breath
Don’t waste it

Cause your time is limited
All you have is the breath already exiting your lungs
If you won’t live, you might as well die
You can’t afford to lead that life

LA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA LA
Life is but a breath
Don’t waste it

Hands down, no regrets
Life has its hands around my neck
Fight back, no regrets
Life has it’s hands around our necks

LA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA LA
Life is but a breath
Don’t waste it

LA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA LA
Life is but a breath
Don’t waste it
