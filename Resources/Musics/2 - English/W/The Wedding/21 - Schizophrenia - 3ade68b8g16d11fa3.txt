SCHIZOPHRENIA

I want it all and I want nothing, all at the same time,
because I am the one that they warned me about
I won't ask for any handouts,
I'll take what I need in time,
because I am the one that they warned me about.

It just goes on and on

I am my own worst enemy.
I sink my teeth into the hand that feeds. 
I curse and praise in the same breath.
Which man in the mirror is the one that's left?

Now it's never too late for coming clean,
I'll let you in but I won't let you out.
I bottled up all of regrets and I threw them into the sea,
I'll let you in but I won't let you out.

And it goes on and on.

I am my own worst enemy.
I sink my teeth into the hand that feeds. 
I curse and praise in the same breath.
Which man in the mirror is the one that's left?

Well just let me tell you, pretty baby,
the only thing holding me back was my pride,
and I can assure you, pretty baby,
that it's much better to be a fool in their eyes.

I am my own worst enemy.
I sink my teeth into the hand that feeds. 
I curse and praise in the same breath.
Which man in the mirror is the one that's left?

If all you are is a little confused, then all your sins are excused

That's what you thought, well didn't you?
