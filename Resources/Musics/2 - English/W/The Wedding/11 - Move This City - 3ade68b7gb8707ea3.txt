MOVE THIS CITY

And false accusations destroy relationships
I hope you’re happy with all the lies you’ve spread
Well I say we change things up, 
Trade out this hate with love
But it has got to start with us

Let’s be the ones to move this city
If you’re with me then say,
Whoa…yeah…
But if we fail we'll just keep trying till we make it
Whoa.yeah.

My strength is not determined by never messing up
But that every time that I fall down
Is one more time that I will get back up
I'll get back up

So choose your battles wisely
Get in line
Look around
Family is what you’ll find
