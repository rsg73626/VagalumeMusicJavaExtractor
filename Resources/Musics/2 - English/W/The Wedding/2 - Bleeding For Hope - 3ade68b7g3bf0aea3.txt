BLEEDING FOR HOPE

These times they leave you bleeding for hope
And wishing that someone would take you home
Will you be the one who cares and were I can run to
Cause you're everything I want
And you're everything I needed

These times they leave you feeling so lost
And hating whatever it is you've become
And all of the hope that you dare to hold will lead you home
Cause you're everything I want
And you're everything I needed
And you threw down heaven's doors
Cause you wanted to be everything to me

Cause you're everything I want
And you're everything I needed
And you threw down heaven's doors
Cause you wanted to be everything to me
