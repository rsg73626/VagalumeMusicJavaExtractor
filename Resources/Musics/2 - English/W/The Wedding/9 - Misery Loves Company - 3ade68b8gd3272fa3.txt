MISERY LOVES COMPANY

I’ve done so much wrong, it outweighs the (good) I’ve done so much wrong, it outweighs the good
I’ve found the hardest things to do 
Are the ones I should.
But you gave me all the grace; I needed to get out.
And I will not forget it Lord, I will walk it out.

Chorus:
The Demon on my shoulder says 
"You will pay for this.
Did you think you could escape all the consequences?"
But it is not in me; 
it’s in Your grace, that I’m set free.

I feel sick; it’s something I can’t (shake)
I feel sick, it's something I can't shake
And night after night it’s keeping me awake.
Am I sorry that I hurt You, 
Or that judgment finally came?
I will not pass it off on You 
Cause I’m the one to blame.

(Chorus)

I know there’s someway you can turn this around.
Don’t give up on me yet; I’m not yet in the ground.
You've given me one more chance, a million times before.
But I still hear another one, knocking at my door

(Chorus x2)
