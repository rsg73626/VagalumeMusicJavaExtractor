REVELATION

They take off their coats and they start to fill the rows.
The scene is all laid out; it’s what we always dreamed about.

Chorus:
Cause you and me have stood the test of time
and proved that we will make it out all right.
Today is when faith will turn to sight.

The preacher takes his place, all eyes watching as I wait.
The doors open wide and I can’t believe my eyes.

(Chorus)

Funny thing is it doesn’t matter much,
what the world could try and throw at us.
Cause they could never touch us now

(Chorus)
