JOYRIDE

Won’t you come and take a ride with me
I’ll take you to all
Beautiful places that you’ve never seen
But you always wanted to

We’re fighting against the mainstream
Against everything they tell us we should be
We’re striving to mold our lives by our dreams
So our dreams can become reality

Won’t you come and take a ride with me
I'll take you to all
Beautiful places you’ve never seen
But you always wanted to
And we’ll find our hearts on this lonely stretch of road
And I will be there

We’re trying to win our hearts back in a world
Where we just don’t know who we are
We’re trying to win our hearts in a world where
The others are the ones who wear the crown

So follow your heart and you
Will find it on on your own
And it’ll all become clear by the time we make it home
And we’ll always remember
These talks that we’ve had
And I will be there
