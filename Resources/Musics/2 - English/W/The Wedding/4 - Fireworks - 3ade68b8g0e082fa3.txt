FIREWORKS

You put your stock in a girl you’d swear was all your own.
But all the while you think you have something that you don’t,

And it took a while to walk away from that.
Yeah it took a while to walk away from that.
It’s like I'd always say.

Chorus:
Fireworks on the fourth of July making up the plans,
Up the plans that you made.
Nobody cares if there’s no girl by your side.
They're staring at the painted sky.

I close my eyes and pretend your sitting here with me.
While I try to put my finger on exactly what it was that made you leave.

Yeah it took some time to walk away from that.
Yeah it took some time to walk away from that 
And time is all that I have.

(Chorus)

It goes like this and we never walk away,
sthe past is the past but it’s here to stay.

(Chorus)

Pull it together boy you don’t look so well and you got nothing but time to kill
