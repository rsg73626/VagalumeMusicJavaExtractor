SOME GOOD THING

Think of this heart as an old accident 
A hardened hit and run 
Looking ahead but just a little scared 
To keep all eyes on the road 

Can you be sure 
Will this be some good thing 
Lucky stars to reckon appear again and again 
Can you believe all that has brought you here 
You say come on baby let's go ahead and live 

Who ever knows if love's a sleight of hand 
Will it hold up to the light 
And do you ever stop unravelling a happy end 
With a mind still wound up from a fight 

Can it be real 
Will it be some good thing 
Weathering the fortunes 
What those stars are gonna bring 
Will it stay true 
Will we both see the whole thing true 
You say come on baby let's go ahead and love 

Bird on a wire or heart in your hand 
Looking for a place to find some rest 
If you batten it down it's not living at all 
Leaving's just a different kind of death 

Could you believe 
Will this be some good thing 
A place to lay your head down 
And the will to look again 
Could it be true 
Will we both see the whole thing true 
You say come on baby let's go ahead 
Come on baby let's go ahead 
Come baby let's go ahead and live
