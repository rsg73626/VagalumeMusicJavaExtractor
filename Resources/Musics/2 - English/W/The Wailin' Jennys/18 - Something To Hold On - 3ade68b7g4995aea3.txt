SOMETHING TO HOLD ON

There's a light on in your house
but you're not home today
And each time I come on by you seem so far away
Can you give me some reason to hold on
Can you give me some reason to stay

Got some friends knocking on my door
Wondering where I've been
Tired of mining for your heart, I've come up for air again
Can you give me some reason to hold on
Can you give me some reason to stay

Stay
Now I'm going away, will I leave you crying
It's been 40 days but this love is dying
I've searched all around for something
Something to hold onto, and a reason to stay

So I'm cashing in your promises
gonna leave without a sound
Got a broken heart and aching head
cause I know you can't be found Can you give me some reason to hold on
Can you give me some reason to stay

Stay
Now I'm going away, will I leave you crying
It's been 40 days but this love is dying
I've searched all around for something
Something to hold onto, and a reason to stay

Stay
Now I'm going away, will I leave you crying
It's been 40 days but this love is dying
I've searched all around for something
Something to hold onto, and a reason to stay
Something to hold onto, and a reason to stay
