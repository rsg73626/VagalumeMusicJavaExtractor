GLORY BOUND

When I hear that trumpet sound 
I will lay my burdens down 
I will lay them deep into the ground 
Then I'll know that I am glory bound 

I'll be travelling far from home 
But I won't be looking for to roam 
I'll be crossing o'er the great divide 
In a better home soon I will reside 

Hallelujah 

When I'm in my resting place 
I'll look on my mother's face 
Never more will I have to know 
All the loneliness that plagues me so 

So I'm waiting for that train to come 
And I know where she's coming from 
Listen can you hear her on the track 
When I board I won't be looking back 

Hallelujah
