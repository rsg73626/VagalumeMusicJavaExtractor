FIRECRACKER

A is for apple, B is for blind 
I jumped so fast I left the ground behind 
You set your sights homeward 
And you are more than wise 
It's late night heading into morning 

You can get used to almost anything 
Deep sea eyes, porcelain skin 
Love's sweet nests and their boxing rings 
It's late night heading into morning 

Firecracker, firecracker 
Sparkling in the sky 
To those of us who saw 
Looked like the fire should die 
Knowledge pulls the reigns against 
The bliss that I once knew 
When you set your sights on me 
And the firecrackers flew 

Ocean of friendship, diamonds far and deep 
We still talk of the future 
Remembering soft sleep 
A is for apple, apple of my eye 
It's late night heading into morning 

Late night heading into morning...
