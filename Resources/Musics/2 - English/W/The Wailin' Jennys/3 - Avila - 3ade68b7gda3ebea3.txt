AVILA

Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen 
Never have you fallen upon this town 
Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen 
Never have you fallen upon this town 

The black crows are loaded 
With the call of things discarded 
The ribboned shard of battle 
And everything burned 
Have they forgotten we live here 
Do they think that we gave up 
Lay down and grew over 
Weeds at every turn 

Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen 
Never have you fallen upon this town 
Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen 
Never have you fallen upon this town 

I will not rest 
Until this place is full of sunlight 
Or at least until the darkness 
Is quiet for a while 
And we will not wait 
For that murder to come calling 
The night will simply fall 
And the morning will rise 

Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen 
Never have you fallen upon this town 
Oh sweet peace, when will you come calling 
When will you come calling upon this town
