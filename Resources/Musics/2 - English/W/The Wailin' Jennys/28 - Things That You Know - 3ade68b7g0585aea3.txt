THINGS THAT YOU KNOW

It's been a long time since you saw your home
Even those you call the closest
Have slipped away somehow
Feels like a lifetime you've been on the road
With so many miles behind you
You'd think you'd have left this world by now

You've seen more than they could ever know
No matter what they say
You've earned the right to be so bold
But this life it takes its toll on you
Every face around you looks so tired and so old

And you have not seen everything
You have not seen everything

But there are things that you know
Things that you know
From where you've had to go
Where you've had to go
Maybe soon you'll find a place
To call your own
To call your home

You've walked a good mile in your brother's shoes
'Til your legs could walk no further
And your tired soles would burn
You know there's peace somewhere around the bend
It's been a long time coming
And you're ready for your turn

And you have not seen everything
You have not seen everything

But there are things that you know
Things that you know
From where you've had to go
Where you've had to go
Maybe soon you'll find a place
To call your own
To call your home
