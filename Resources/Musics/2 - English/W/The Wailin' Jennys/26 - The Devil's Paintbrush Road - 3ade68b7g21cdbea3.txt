THE DEVIL'S PAINTBRUSH ROAD

I held on for so long 
Dusty quaint old song 
Things attach with glue 
Live and die and gone 

June flowers are so bold 
On the devil's paintbrush road 
The devil paints a double life 
And there I dare not go 

Live and die and gone 
Live and die and gone 
The devil paints a double life 
Live and die and gone 

I'm not the cheating kind 
It snuck from behind 
Kicked in the door to someday 
I can't get her off my mind 

All or nothing now 
Might as well be true 
Leave the dream of hearth and home 
That never will come true 

Live and die and gone 
Live and die and gone 
Leave the dream of hearth and home 
Live and die and gone 

Sweet wild road ahead 
Sweet wild road ahead 
If I lied and said that all was well 
I might as well be dead 

Single I was born 
And single I will die 
I'll marry myself to the whole wide world 
And never make her cry 

Live and die and gone 
Live and die and gone 
I'll marry myself to the whole wide world 
Live and die and gone 

Live and die and gone 
Live and die and gone 
The devil paints a double life 
Live and die and gone
