TEN MILE STILTS

Imagine you're a girl on ten mile stilts
You travel round the world, taking it all in
You'll never touch the ground
Is it a blessing or a curse
And if you're too high to be found
Are you lost or just rehearsed

Got a heart that opens clear in this cool September dark
It rests on treetop leaves
And bursts its little sparks
And sometimes it sings its songs
And it lets its secrets out
Except for one that sears inside
That it cannot live without

But if I tell you will you take it
Will you shine it up to me
Can you be strong to let me go on
And set this freedom free

The stars are out tonight
Up here they're ripe to hold
But I have learned what comes to those who get too close
I'm no Icarus in flight
And I'm old enough to know
That love is patient, but still unyielding
If you leave it long enough it lets you go

But if I tell you wil you take it
Will you shine it up to me
Can you be strong to let me go on
And set this freedom free
