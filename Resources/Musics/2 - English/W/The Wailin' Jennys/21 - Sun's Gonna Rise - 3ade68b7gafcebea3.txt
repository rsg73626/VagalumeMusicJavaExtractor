SUN'S GONNA RISE

I have lines under my eyes that I didn't have last year 
I've got the world's weight on my shoulders and I have wept a thousand years 
And I'm looking for a saviour to take me far away from here 
Where the storm has passed over and the sky above is clear 

I've got lines under my eyes that I've never had before 
There's a war outside my window and a wasteland outside my door 
And I've been traveling down this road all these days and all these nights 
I've been traveling for so long now, I've been searching for the light 

We've got pain and we've got sorrow that we've been trying not to feel 
We've got trouble all around us and we've got wounds that still won't heal 
So let's hold on to each other and let love take us through the night 
Help us stumble through the darkness, take us to the morning light 

I have lines under my eyes that I didn't have last year 
I've got the world's weight on my shoulders but I won't shed another tear 
Cause the sun is gonna rise and tomorrow's another day 
And we will hold on to each other and we will sing and we will pray
