THIS HEART OF MINE

If all is fair in love and war
I haven't seen the score
But it can't be either of those

And all this time, thought I was in control
But fate she held her own
Even when I thought I chose

Now the coldest day of winter
Has made a home of my heart
It burns a cold right through me
Tearing me apart

When did I lose you?
It feels like such a crime
When did I lose all
The reasons for this rhyme
So many questions burning
In this heart of mine

A thousand memories
Of when and where
Four walls and a rocking chair
Our story sticking to my skin

A dusty wind
Blows through this broken frame
Echoes of your name
Shadows fall and night pours in

Now the coldest day of winter
Has made a home of a heart
Says it plans to stay forever
Just like you did at the start

When did I lose you?
It feels like such a crime
When did I lose all
The reasons for this rhyme
So many questions burning
In this heart of mine

Now the coldest day of winter
Is here and here to stay
And it burns a cold right through me
'Round the heart you threw away

When did I lose you?
It feels like such a crime
When did I lose all
The reasons for this rhyme
So many questions burning
In this heart of mine
