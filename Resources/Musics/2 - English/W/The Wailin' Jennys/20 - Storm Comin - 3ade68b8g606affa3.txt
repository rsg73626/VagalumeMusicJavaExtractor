STORM COMIN

When that storm comes
Don't run for cover
When that storm comes
Don't run for cover
When that storm comes
Don't run for cover
Don't run from the comin' storm cause 
there ain't no use in runnin'

When that rain falls
Let it wash away
When that rain falls
Let it wash away
When that rain falls
Let it wash away
Let it wash away, that falling rain, the tears and the trouble

When those lights flash
Then you'll hear that thunder roar
When those lights flash
You'll hear that thunder roar
When those lights flash
You'll hear that thunder roar
Will you listen to that thunder roar and let your spirit soar

When that love calls
Will you open up your door
When that love calls
Will you open up your door
When that love calls
Will you open up your door
You gotta stand on up and let it in, 
you gotta let love through your door

When that storm comes
Don't run for cover
When that storm comes
Don't run for cover
When that storm comes
Don't run for cover
Don't run from the comin' storm
Cause you cant keep a storm from comin'
