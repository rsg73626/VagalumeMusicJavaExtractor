MONA LOUISE

I'm gonna sing till my feet turn blue
I'll sing loud enough to go through
The mountains to you

I'm gonna dance when the music stops
When soft hearts they can't sit still

Oh wake up the day
Darken the night
Lighten my eyelids cause I don't wanna sleep
While you're shining so bright
Sweet mona louise

I'm gonna carry your picture
Til I fix up a place down the stream
It might be a long time till we're catching rainbow trout
But don't you doubt cause we always will

Oh wake up the day
Darken the night
Lighten my eyelids cause I don't wanna sleep
While you're shining so bright
Sweet mona louise

The waterfall will rock your little song to sleep
The light will spark your heart and you'll rise up to keep
All the simple gifts that shine everywhere I see
Shine for me mona louise
So wake up the day
Darken the night
Lighten my eyelids cause I don't wanna sleep
While you're shining so bright
Sweet mona louise
Sweet dreams
