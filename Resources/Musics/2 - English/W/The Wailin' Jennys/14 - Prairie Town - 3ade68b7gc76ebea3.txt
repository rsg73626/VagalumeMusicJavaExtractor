PRAIRIE TOWN

When it rains it snows in this prairie town 
There's a good three inches on the ground 
It seems I'll be losing any peace I've found 

I see your face all over this town 
But I know you're nowhere to be found 
You're far away, you're safe and sound 

Far from this prairie town 
Far from this prairie town 

So leaving seems the thing to do 
When I'm here I'm lost in thoughts of you 
And in my dreams I'm city bound 

But if you ask me to come to you 
To leave these fields and these skies of blue 
You know I'd be leaving my sacred ground 

Leaving this prairie town 
Leaving this prairie town 

No one's love comes close to yours 
Nothing's what it was before 
My eyes are heavy and my heart is sore 

Leaving this prairie town 
Leaving this prairie town 

When it rains it snows in this prairie town 
And we just watch it fall to the ground 
And wait for love to come around 

So ask me in that way you do 
And I'll leave these fields and I'll come to you 
And watch my heart as it breaks in two 

I'm leaving this prairie town 
I'm leaving this prairie town
