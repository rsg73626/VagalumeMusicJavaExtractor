UNTITLED

To the man who lost his mind 
Left home for the last time 
They found him in the wintertime 
Looking for something he couldn't find 

They shipped him way out West 
Thought they'd put their minds at rest 
Now they've thrown the key away 
And there's nothing left to say 

Waiting for a saviour 
Show me you're so sad 
Wipe the tears that you've had 
Show me you're so sad 

To the girl who lives next door 
Wonders what her life is for 
She's waiting for her valentine 
To kiss her in the summertime 

He doesn't come and so she cries 
Locks her door and hopes to die 
Now she's thrown the key away 
And there's nothing left to say 

Waiting for a saviour 
Show me you're so sad 
Wipe the tears that you've had 
Show me you're so sad 

Now to the ones you've left behind 
Were they not worth your time 
They never heard you say goodbye 
They never got a reason why 

And here's to you who couldn't see 
What it was you did to me 
Now you've thrown it all away 
And there's nothing left to say 
And there's nothing left to say 

Waiting for a saviour 
Show me you're so sad 
Wipe the tears that you've had 
Show me you're so sad
