SWING LOW SAIL HIGH

I have failed you, I have failed you
I have lost my way, lost my nerve
I've failed you

But I love you, how I love you
I have turned my back, left you last
But I love you

O setting sun don't sink before I've found my heart
Heart don't give up now while there's still time
Time don't beat your old retreat
Stay a little while with me
Til I've looked the whole thing in the eye

I have waited, I have waited
For the big reveal, the even keel
I have waited

But there's no one who
Makes it all come true
Just altars gathering dust while we bow to them

O night bring all your shadows and your silence
Silence make a hostage of my mind
Mind bring on your trickery
Black dogs nip on at my heels
Til I've looked the whole thing in the eye

Swing low, sail high

I have failed you, I have failed you
I've closed my heart,
I have failed you

But I love you, how I love you
All my days will rearrange to say I love you

O setting sun don't weep for all the things you lose
Morning comes as sure as it must die
Dying is such mystery
Yet I wonder will it be
When I've looked the whole thing in the eye
