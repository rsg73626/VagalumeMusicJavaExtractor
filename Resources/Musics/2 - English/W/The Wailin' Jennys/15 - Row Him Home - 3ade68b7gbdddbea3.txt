ROW HIM HOME

Across that river through the orange squares of light 
Past the streetlamp like a beacon in the rain 
You've stopped in all this motion 
You're heavy with news too sudden 
You're breathing through this undertow of pain 

And all your friends will gather soon 
And you'll surface then to bring them through 
You'll say "it's better this way" and "at least we knew" 
But this practice in leaving 
All these small moves to grieving 
Does it ever really promise what's deserved? 

You want to take him in your arms 
And carry to the river 
Find the boy he once was and row him home 
You want a majesty restored 
Find the place where love was born and let him go 

Many Sundays passed since the day of his first leaving 
You stopped asking for the rule to be reversed 
And with the grace that follows those who know what love is 
You held his hand and walked towards this strange rebirth 
And as the friends gather round to bear witness 
You struggle with the fight to find some peace, to make it worth it 

You want to take him in your arms 
And carry to the river 
Find the boy he once was and row him home 
You want a majesty restored 
Find the place where love was born and let him go 
Let him go
