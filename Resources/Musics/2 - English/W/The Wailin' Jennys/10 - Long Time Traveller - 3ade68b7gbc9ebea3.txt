LONG TIME TRAVELLER

These fleeting charms of earth 
Farewell, your springs of joy are dry 
My soul now seeks another home 
A brighter world on high 

I'm a long time travelling here below 
I'm a long time travelling away from home 
I'm a long time travelling here below 
To lay this body down 

Farewell kind friends whose tender care 
Has long engaged my love 
Your fond embrace I now exchange 
For better friends above 

I'm a long time travelling here below 
I'm a long time travelling away from home 
I'm a long time travelling here below 
To lay this body down...
