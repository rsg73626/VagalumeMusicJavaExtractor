SWALLOW

Oh swallow
What did you swallow?
You swoop so low
You come and you go

You flew right in from that ship on the sea
Pirate sails on the wind coming for me

You wooed me, pursued me
You hooked me, you booked me
I signed up my name
Said I'll be your game

You got me, arrow shot me
Now come connect the dot me
And if you don't want it
then free me, I will flee

Oh swallow
What did you swallow?
You swoop so low
You come and you go

Something, something
You think you got something
Something to show
For all that hellbent letting go

I got me a handful
A handful of pebbles
One ball of light
One shining flght

You glide on the air
You swivel and turn
Fast beating heart
What do I gotta learn?

Oh swallow
What did you swallow?
You swoop so low
You come and you go
