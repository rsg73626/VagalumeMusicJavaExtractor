COME ALL YOU SAILORS

Come all you sailors
Sail upon my sea
Swim in these salty waters
Cleanse the wounds that run so deep

Come all you lovers
Give your hearts to me
Come with your broken dreams and
Your ruined fancies

Come all you seekers
Realize that you can see
Find within your deepest longing
That all you need is me
