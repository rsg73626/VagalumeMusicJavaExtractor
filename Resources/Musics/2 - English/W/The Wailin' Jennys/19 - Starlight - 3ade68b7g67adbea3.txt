STARLIGHT

I have come back to you broken 
take me home 
And my body bears this trouble 
take me home 
Take me back to my beginning 
Before the hell of night set in 
And I came to this border 
take me home 

I have toured the endless starlight 
take me home 
I have shattered under midnight 
take me home 
There are no vultures in this clearing 
Except the ones who brought me here 
And I'll no longer feed them 
take me home 

Kingdom come, their will was done 
And now the earth is far away 
from any kind of heaven 
Hallowed be these frozen fields 
And every single one of us 
still left in want of mercy 
Take us home 

Now the bells stand still and hollow 
take me home 
And no one has come to mourn me 
take me home 
Find me where I close my eyes 
Beneath this sky of powerlines 
And let me see us clearly 
take me home 

Kingdom come, their will was done 
And now the earth is far away 
from any kind of heaven 
Hallowed be these frozen fields 
And every single one of us 
Still left in want of mercy 
Take us home...
