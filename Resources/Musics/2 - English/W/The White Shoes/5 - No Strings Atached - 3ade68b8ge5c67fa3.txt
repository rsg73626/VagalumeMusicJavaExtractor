NO STRINGS ATACHED

VERSE 1:
When the Sun 
Decides to wake up
Bringin one whole 
Brand new day 
Will we come to show me last night was a dream? 
Or will you wake up by my side? 

VERSE 2:
When the Moon 
Sings the Sun to sleep 
Showing how we are promiscuos
All dressed in yellow you're so good and looking good
Allow me to say you just look better with your clothes off

PRE-CHORUS: 
Follow your instincts
And let's rise the temperature

CHORUS:
'Cause when we kiss sparks come out from our tongues
It's beautiful how your body match my mattress
Whispering romantic songs in my ear 
All four walls keep quiet while we're exchanging body heats 
There's nothing like when your sweaty body is glued to mine 
And in this room is where i'll love you just for tonight 
But no strings atached

VERSE 3:
You spark 
Exciment in the boys 
Looking like that couldn't be otherside
I know this words may sound cliche but it's the truth 
Your beauty kills me there is nothing i can do 

PRE-CHORUS 

CHORUS
