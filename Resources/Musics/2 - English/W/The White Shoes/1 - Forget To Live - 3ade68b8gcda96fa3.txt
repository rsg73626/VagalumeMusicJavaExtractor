FORGET TO LIVE

VERSE 1
I can´t do this
Is what they say
Leaving regrets
Along the way
Watching life
Pass you by
While you lock your heart
So you can't cry

  CHORUS
Hiding ourselfs
Behind the fear
This is how we
Forget to live

  VERSE 2
"Don´t expose yourself"
"Never let love in"
Is this how you wold
Like your life to be?
We're not like stones
That can't get hurt
But we are like the Sun
Always can shine again

CHORUS

  BRIDGE
I don´t want
I don´t need
I don't see
I don't love you
That's not truth

  INTRO CHORUS
Hiding ourselfs
Behind the fear

CHORUS (x2)
