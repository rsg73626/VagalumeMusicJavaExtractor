THERE ARE THINGS

VERSE 1
Back then,
We used to go out
Back then,
You used to make me smile
Back then,
All I used to say
Please stay,
Just a little while

  CHORUS
There are things I wanna say to you
There are things that I've been thinking of
For all the things that you made me go trought
You're a bich, I'm sorry it's true

  VERSE 2
Thank god
Time passed n' I could see
The kind of
Person you can be
Don't say
You ever forgot
Dance while
you hold a new me

CHORUS

  BRIDGE
Now don't wait up
Don't wait up for me
Now don't wait up
For me to beg your sorry
Now don't wait up
You better get some sleep 'cause
We will never speak again

CHORUS
