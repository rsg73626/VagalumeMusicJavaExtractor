GOSSIP GIRLS

VERSE 1:
You keep walking and dancing 
Like there's no one else on the floor
Go around breaking young boys hearts
But you can't see the pieces spread on the ground

Hey girls let's spend some money
Isn't that what you are good at?
Hey girls let's see who wins 
The popularity competition

'Cause they're all 

CHORUS:
Gossip girls, gossip girls 
With nothing better to do but
Gossip girls, gossip girls 
Taking photos in front of the mirror 
Gossip girls, gossip girls 
With nothing better to talk
Gossip girls, gossip girls
Can't you see your crown? You're drama queen

VERSE 2:
Boys drinking 'n smoking 
It's all what your life is about 
Unsatisfied with your boyfriends
Making of'em t-shirts changing whatever they want

Hey girls better fix your hair 
And learn that "I love you" is not goodnight
Hey girls one more for the list
Please watch out you will miscount

Cause you're all

CHORUS
 
Gossip girls, gossip girls 
Gossiping around.

BRIDGE: 
Is this all you can do? 
You don't know how to 
Put you brain to work 
Except for this reason 

Yes you're all 

CHORUS

Gossip girls, gossip girls (x4)
