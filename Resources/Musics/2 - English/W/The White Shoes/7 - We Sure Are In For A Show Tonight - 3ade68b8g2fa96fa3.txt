WE SURE ARE IN FOR A SHOW TONIGHT

VERSE 1
Please get ready
You about to enter
The most incredible room
Of all times
This is the room where
Everything takes place
So just lose yourself
On the dance floor

  CHORUS
Don't speak
Don't think
Just dance
Dance 'till your feet
Are defeated
Don't speak
Don't think
Just dance
Dance 'till your soul says it's enought

  VERSE 2
Please get dressed for
This amazing night
White Shoes, strange hair and
An open mind
Tonight, even got can't deny
That you're fabulous
As you walk by

CHORUS (Only vocal and guitar)

  SOLO

CHORUS (x2)
