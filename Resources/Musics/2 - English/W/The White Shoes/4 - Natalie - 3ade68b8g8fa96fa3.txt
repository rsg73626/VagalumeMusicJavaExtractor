NATALIE

VERSE 1
Today I got outta home
A cold wind hit my face
It's the winter
It's knocking on my door
This depressive weather
Reminds me of you
And all the time we spend together
Back in high school

  PRE-CHORUS
But today is just like the weather
You're so cold
Oh so cold
Althought you say you're no in love
I know, well I know

  CHORUS
Then I look up the sky n' ask
If liking you so much is wrong
'Cause honey you look so good
Sometimes it hurts
Then I look at you n' see your smile
Why can't we be more then frinds?
Honey come with me
Let's build a life
