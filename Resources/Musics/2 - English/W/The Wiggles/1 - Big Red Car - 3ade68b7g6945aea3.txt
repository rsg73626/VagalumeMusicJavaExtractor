BIG RED CAR

CHORUS 
Jump in the car 
And buckle up 
And we can ride the whole day long 
Jump in the car 
Put on my seat belt 
And we can ride the whole day long 


Ride into town 
Walk down the street 
Get back in the car 
And buckle up into my seat 
Yes that’s the way we do it 
Riding in our big red car 

CHORUS 

On holidays 
We go down to the beach 
Get back in the car 
And buckle up into my seat 
Yes that’s the way we do it 
Riding in our big red car
