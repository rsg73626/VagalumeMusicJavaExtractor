D.O.R.O.T.H.Y

Well who’s that in the garden 
Eating all our red red roses? 
(Its Dorothy – that’s me) 
She wears a floppy white hat and 
Has yellow spots galore 
(Nice spots Dorothy – Thank you!) 
Well look at those big green paws (wow) 
She’s a very friendly dinosaur 

CHORUS 
D.O.R.O.T.H.Y Dorothy the Dinosaur 
(Talkin’ ‘bout) 
D.O.R.O.T.H.Y she’s my favourite dinosaur 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp, hey! 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp, hey! 

(Oh I think Dorothy’s dong some gardening guys) 
She’s a really helpful dinosaur 
She works so hard in the garden 
(She’s got her mower, she’s mowing) 
Yes, she pulls out all the weeds 
Plants more roses and she mows the lawn 
(She’s mowing, she’s mowing) 
When the music starts she dances on the floor 
Yes, she’s a really groovy dinosaur 
(Man, she’s groovy) 

CHORUS 

D.O.R.O.T.H.Y Dorothy the Dinosaur 
(Talkin’ ‘bout) 
D.O.R.O.T.H.Y she’s my favourite dinosaur 
(Groovy!) 
Come on everyone, let’s dance and sing 
With our friend Dorothy
