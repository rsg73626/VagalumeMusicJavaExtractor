WAKE UP JEFF

CHORUS 
Wake up, Jeff, everybody’s wiggling 
Wake up, Jeff, we really need you 
Wake up, Jeff; you’re missing all the fun now 
Wake up, Jeff, before the days through 

What’s that sound?, I can hear somebody snoring 
What’s that sound?, its not Murray or Greg 
Anthony’s awake, so let’s have another guess now 
Oh my goodness, it must be Jeff 

CHORUS 


Dorothy the dinosaur is munching on some roses 
Wags the Dog is digging up bones 
Henry the Octopus is dancing round in circles 
Wake up Jeff; we need you for the show
