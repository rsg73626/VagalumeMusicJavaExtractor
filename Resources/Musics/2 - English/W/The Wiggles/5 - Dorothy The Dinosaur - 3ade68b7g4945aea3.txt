DOROTHY THE DINOSAUR

I was lookin’ out my window 
Late the other night 
She was sitting in the garden 
and gave me such a fright 
Eating all Mum’s roses 
there in the moonlight 
It was Dorothy the Dinosaur 
I knew that if Mum saw her 
She’d never let her stay 
A dinosaur as big as that 
Needs feeding night and day 
Id have to find a place 
Where I could hide her away 
Dorothy the Dinosaur 

CHORUS 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp 
Romp-bomp-a-chomp 
Dorothy the Dinosaur (chomp) 

I knew that she was so big 
That she’d soon be found 
My mother called the dog catcher 
He came around 
When he laid his eyes on her 
He fell to the ground 
“Now I take it that’s Dorothy the Dinosaur” 

CHORUS 

They called up the police 
To take her right away 
They called up the zoo 
To find a place to stay 
I said they couldn’t take her 
I said “No way, that’s Dorothy the Dinosaur” 
(“That’s me”)
