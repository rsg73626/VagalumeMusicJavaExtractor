IT'S YOUR LIFE

Money makers, movers, shakers 
Undertakers, ballbreakers, they speak to you
With parents quiet and TV riot you choose to buy it
You let their prefab message through
With slicked back hair and charm to spare you'd almost swear
Those cue cards had disappeared
But then you catch one off his guard, you push too hard
And see just what the suits had feared

CHORUS 
It's your life and they're living it for you
Fat cats in dark suits you know they adore you
If true love is dead then it's gone to their head
"Just take all their money" is all the man said
It's your... life
It's your life

The melody is market tested, 
All their research they've invested to 
Read your mind
The road to hell is paved as well with teenage midriffs bare to sell
To leave you blind
To other shapes and different sizes
Crooked teeth and weird surprises Such a shame 
That locust swarms of makeup artists, plastic surgeons,
Pop star martyrs are all to blame

[CHORUS]

What's left to say
Their smile is prettier anyway
I just thought I'd try
I, for one, am tired of 
Living this lie

Like cheap perfume, a plastic bloom, the aftertaste we must assume is
Less than good
The t-shirt rips, the CD skips, the next big thing tends to eclipse
That's understood

[CHORUS]  

Ye-yeah, Ye-yeah
It's Your Life ...
