SATISFIED

If I never get that house, that car
Or be a superstar
And my dreams never come true
Will I be satisfied with you
And if no one ever knows my name
And my gifts don't bring me fame
If everything I have, someday I lose
Will I be satisfied with you

Don't get me wrong
It'd be nice to have nice things
And everybody loves the love that all those nice things bring
But when the lights turn out and it's just me and you
When you ask me to choose, then what will I do
See, if I gain the world, then I lose my soul
Who sticks by my side when my years grow old
So it's not easy but when I think of you
I want to be satisfied with you

If I never get that house, that car
Or be a superstar
And my dreams never come true
Will I be satisfied with you
And if no one ever knows my name
And my gifts don't bring me fame
If everything I have, someday I lose
Will I be satisfied with you

It's so easy to think money changes everything
But when all the money's gone will I still be happy
How much did I cost me searching for celebrity
Did it, Cost me my life
Was it worth the price
I've been searching for so long for something real
Something deeper than what I see out there
Took me a while, now my search is through
Jesus I'll be satisfied with you

Satisfied with you
You
Jesus I want you
All I want
When I close my eyes
Will I be right by your side
Standing face to face finally
Will you be satisfied with me

If I never get that house, that car
Or be a superstar
And my dreams never come true
Will I be satisfied with you
And if no one ever knows my name
And my gifts don't bring me fame
If everything I have, someday I lose
Will I be satisfied with you

Satisfied with you
Satisfied with you
