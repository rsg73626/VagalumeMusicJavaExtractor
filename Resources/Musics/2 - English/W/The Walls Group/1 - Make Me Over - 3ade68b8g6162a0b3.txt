MAKE ME OVER

I don't want to be this way no more
Make me over
I want to be changed and saved
Oh, holy father

Oh, lord
Please restore my soul
Oh, lord
Make me over again
Make me over again

I don't want to be this way no more
Make me over
I want to be changed and saved
Oh, holy father

Oh, lord
Please restore my soul
Oh, lord
Make me over again
Make me over again

Not my will but yours be done
In my life
Cleanse me, oh lord
Fix me, heal me
Make me over again
Again

Please change me
Oh lord
Please save me
Oh, lord

Oh, lord
Please restore my soul
Oh, lord
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
