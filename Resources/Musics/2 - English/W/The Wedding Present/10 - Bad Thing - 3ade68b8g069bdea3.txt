BAD THING

And when I kissed her, she tasted of beer 
She said she was nervous about being here 
She said I don't usually do 
The things I'm doing with you

Sha said I lied and I felt like a swine 
I laughed as I opened a bottle of wine 
And when I offered her some 
I said oh why have you come 

She said I don't think you should be so disparaging 
I'm still a good person, just doing a bad thing

When it's over we lay on the bed 
She sighed disappointedly and then said 
I wasn't expecting this (but did I really) 
Shave my legs just for this (it wasn't even nearly)
