DON'T TALK, JUST KISS

He didn't see me
He sort of looked uneasy
But I'm sure he didn't guess
Oh he's never liked me
And yeah okay it might be
A bit better if you left

Oh was it me who said that?
No please come straight back
You've got to stay with me somehow
Well say you missed your train
What have you got to gain
By leaving here right now?

If you're worried he's so near you might as well go back
You were never here, oh why would I say that?
Look everybody lies about this
Don't talk, just kiss!

If you're worried he's so near you might as well go back
You were never here, oh why would I say that?
Look everybody lies about this
Don't talk, just kiss!

I want to wake up near you
Oh yeah of course I hear you
But you're just off back to row
Well put yourself above him
Look if you really loved him
I don't think you'd be here now

Oh come on what do you care?
He's probably not even there
Oh yeah I'm sure he'd sit and wait
Its just whenever you touch
Oh God I want you so much
And you can't say it's too late

If you're worried he's so near you might as well go back
You were never here, oh why would I say that?
Look everybody lies about this
Don't talk, just kiss!

If you're worried he's so near you might as well go back
You were never here, oh why would I say that?
Look everybody lies about this
Don't talk, just kiss!

Don't talk, just kiss
Don't talk, just kiss
Don't talk, just kiss
Don't talk, just kiss
