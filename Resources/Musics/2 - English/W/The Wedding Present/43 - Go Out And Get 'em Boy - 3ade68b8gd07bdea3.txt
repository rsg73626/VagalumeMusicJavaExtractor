GO OUT AND GET 'EM BOY

You were a survivor after all
You never even called (I didn't expect you to)
Now, there's such a lot you've done
And you're only twenty-one (yes, you're only twenty-one)

Oh, there's just something; something I noticed
That there's a whole world out there but it's shrinking fast
You want to take it all and make it last forever
Or maybe just a lifetime

Now you've gone to fly the flag
From some pinprick on the map (won't you ever bring it back)
Tonight, when you hold her in your arms
And you prove that you're a man (oh well, I hope she understands)

Oh, there's just something; something I noticed
That there's a whole world out there but it's shrinking fast
You want to take it all and make it last forever
Or maybe just a lifetime, maybe just a lifetime

And some things just don't ever go away
Some things you know are just here to stay

And in a golden field there is a little girl
Left with a union jack
And there's a price to pay, no matter what you say
There is no going back today

And if we're worlds apart, then I've still got a heart
Can you imagine that?
"Another wasted day", yes I can hear you say
But I'm afraid, it means much more to me than that
