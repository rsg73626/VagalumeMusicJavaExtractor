DREAMWORLD

I don't know how many times that I've tried to warn you
How many times I've heard you laugh and say,
"Underneath it all, he's okay" 

And how many times have you rang and sworn
You'd given him one last chance and he let you down
But then he'd call and you'd go back round 

You know I still care because you only have to phone me
and I'll be over there 

Why can't you see just what he's doing to you
Is it all because of him? Well of course it is
And I hate to see you like this 

You just won't understand 
You don't want to listen do you?
Just because it's not what you like to hear
You ask me, and to me it's clear 

You know I still care because you only have to phone me
And I'll be over there to lick your wounds 

You know I'll always be here for you
You say you feel left out
Well I know exactly how to cure you 

You just can't go on pretending
You just can't go on pretending
You just can't go on pretending
You just can't go on pretending
I'm on my way right over there to lick your wounds 

You know I'll always be here for you
You say you feel left out
Well I know exactly how to cure you
You know you make me want to shout

Oh just tell me what is new, girl
You say you feel left out
Well you are living in a dreamworld
