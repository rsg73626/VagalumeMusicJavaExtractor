REAL THING

This is the real thing, there's no doubt
This is what love should be about
This is a feeling I never want to be without 

This is the real thing, there's no doubt
This is what love should be about
This is a feeling I never want to be without 

You're smart whereas I'm just dumb
You smile and then I succumb
I love watching you when you come 

But how can there be so much bliss
In one spur of the moment kiss?
I guess when it's as good as this 

This is the real thing, there's no doubt
This is what love should be about
This is a feeling I never want to be without 

This is the real thing, there's no doubt
This is what love should be about
This is a feeling I never want to be without 

And the moment that I began
To fly higher than Superman
Was when you whispered: "Yes, you can" 

You knew just when to undress
You understand, whereas I just guess
But this is something we both possess 

This is the real thing, there's no doubt
This is what love should be about
This is a feeling I never want to be without 

This is the real thing, there's no doubt
This is what love should be about
This is a feeling I never want to be without
