DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL

Don’t say a word, don’t make this even more absurd
Anyway your eyes confirm what I already knew
More than all your words could ever do

Oh I’ll survive I guess, I’m just feeling powerless
Well when the one thing that you most adore is just about to walk out of the door

OK you’re sure it’s time to go but I’m begging you not to walk away,
Is there really nothing I can say to keep you here
Please don’t just disappear

Is there some way that I can change somehow
‘Cos I don’t think I can live without you now
