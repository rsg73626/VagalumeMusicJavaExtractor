SKIN DIVING

I know you said not to call
Well, so what, I've lost you anyway
But, darling, that's not all
I've got something else to say 

You pretend that I'm not here
So I guess you're hardly pining
If you want, then I'll disappear
But right now the sun is shining 

So come on
Just this one more time
Then I'm gone
Well he can't expect you
To stay home
This is summertime
Besides which, he'd never suspect you 

Sure, just take off your things
Because this is such a cool place to swim
We should go skin diving
And just forget about him 

So come on
Just this one more time
Then I'm gone
Well he can't expect you
To stay home
This is summertime
Besides which, he'd never suspect you 

I'll do it if you will
Oh, so then we both agree
That this means you must be still
A little bit in love with me 

So come on
Just this one more time
Then I'm gone
Well he can't expect you
To stay home
This is summertime
Besides which, he'd never suspect you
