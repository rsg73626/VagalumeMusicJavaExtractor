I'M NOT ALWAYS SO STUPID

Every time a car drives past I think it's you
Every time somebody laughs I think it's you
You changed your number and my phonebook's such a mess
But I can't bear to cross your name out yet
Each time the doorbell rings it might be you
Each letter the postman brings might be from you

I made a fool of myself yet once again
A boy who's been this cruel looks for others to share the blame
Somebody told me you went to work down south
As far away as you can from my big mouth
I bumped into Jane and she told me to drop dead
Oh she's not to blame, I know exactly what I said

Every time a car drives past I think it's you
Every time somebody laughs I think it's you

Every time a car drives past I think it's you
Every time somebody laughs I think it's you
