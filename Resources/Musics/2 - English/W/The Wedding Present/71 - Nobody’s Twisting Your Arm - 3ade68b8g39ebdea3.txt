NOBODYâ€™S TWISTING YOUR ARM

And when I called your house
I'm sure your sister thought that I was somebody else
I heard a laugh down the phone
And then the answer came that you weren't at home (ohh)

You know I never go there
Because I hate to dance and you really don't care
Why don't you go on your own?
How can you lie there and say that you'll come back alone? (ohh)

Oh well that's fine
I don't care anymore
Nobody's twisting your arm
Here's the key
There's the door

Oh well that's fine
I don't care anymore
Nobody's twisting your arm
Here's the key
There's the door

Before we go back in
What about those secret smiles that you were giving to him?
Oh just "somebody you met"
Well I go out of my way and this is the thanks that I get! (ahh)

I'm just a slave to your greed
I'm not the kind of boyfriend that you need
But if you'd like me to go
You'll get no trouble from me just so long as I know (ohh)

Oh well that's fine
I don't care anymore
Nobody's twisting your arm
Here's the key
There's the door

Oh well that's fine
I don't care anymore
Nobody's twisting your arm
Here's the key
There's the door

Take it away, Grapper!

Oh well that's fine
I don't care anymore
Nobody's twisting your arm
Here's the key
There's the door

Oh well that's fine
I don't care anymore
Nobody's twisting your arm
Here's the key
There's the door

I don't love you anymore
