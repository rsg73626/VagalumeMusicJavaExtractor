SO LONG, BABY

No, this is me!
Well are you still there?
Well tell me now, who did you think it would be?
Oh, why do I care?

I'm just kidding myself
Stop trying to be kind
Well you really thought it was somebody else
Oh never mind

I got it all wrong, maybe
But I'm saying "so long", baby!

Aside from all that I still think you're dreamy
You'll say you'll try harder
We both know you won't
But where are you at girl, why won't you see me?
Maybe you love me
And maybe you don't

I don't want to fight
But we've got things to discuss
Like why you don't come home every night
And what about us?

You're not going to win
I know you too well
You've already been to bed with him
Oh I can just tell

I got it all wrong, maybe
But I'm saying "so long", baby!

Aside from all that I still think you're dreamy
You'll say you'll try harder
We both know you won't
But where are you at girl, why won't you see me
Maybe you love me
And maybe you don't
