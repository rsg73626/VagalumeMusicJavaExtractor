LOVE SLAVE

I know what you're going to say
You want to do something scary today
Sure I want to have some fun
I just don't know about some of the things that you've done

But I'm your love slave
And you'll get what you crave

Oh you've got a crazy thirst
And every single kiss is just like the first
Oh you have sucked me dry
How many more times do you want me to try?

Because I'm your love slave
And you'll get what you crave

You know the things you adore?
Well no one ever asked me to do that before
I want to be your special friend
I'm just kind of scared about the way it might end

But I'm your love slave
And you'll get what you crave
