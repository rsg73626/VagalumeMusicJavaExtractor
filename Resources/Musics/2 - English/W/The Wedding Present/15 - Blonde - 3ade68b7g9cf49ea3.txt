BLONDE

Blonde

I'm just some name your book
That's why you gave up writing weeks ago
You won't be getting in touch
Oh do you ever?

And I meant every word that I said
Oh did I try too hard oh, I don't know
You made sure it wouldn't happen again
Oh you're clever!

Yes I was that naive
Yes I was that naive
You've heard this all before
You've heard this all before

I'm just some name your book
That's why you gave up writing weeks ago
You won't be getting in touch
Oh do you ever?

Yes I was that naive
Yes I was that naive
You've heard this all before
You've heard this all before

I still can't believe
That's all you took me for
I still can't believe
That's all you took me for
