REKINDLING

We dangled feet into a stream 
Your smile was sweet, we ate ice-cream 
And we didn’t have a fear 

Made some vows like lovers do 
Then came the rows and I blamed you 
You said I’ll always be here 

You can’t help but remind me 
Of days that I left behind me 
And then, can’t do it again 

I’m not seeing anyone as such 
You’ll agree, yes I thought as much 
We both need some romance 

Let’s just relax, take it a day at a time 
There are no going back’s but if you bear that in mind 
I’m sure we’ve got a chance 

The danger with an old flame is 
That it’s never gonna have the same fizz 
Oh but I, I want to try
