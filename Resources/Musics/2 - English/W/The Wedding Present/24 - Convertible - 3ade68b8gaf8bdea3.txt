CONVERTIBLE

His 
You know that I could make you very happy 
and I warn you now that he won't call
Sure, he said he'd try but he talks so much crap 
he never means what he says at all
Oh, yes her, I'm still with her
But, I guess, I'm always convertible
Just flick the switch and I'm yours
I don't want a friend because I've got friends already 
I just want to go back home with you
I won't pretend because I'm more than ready, 
oh please say you feel it too
Oh, yes her, I'm still with her
But, I guess, I'm always convertible
Just flick the switch and I'm yours
Yours
Just flick the switch and I'm yours
Yours
Just flick the switch and I'm yours

Hers 
But you're still with her
But you're still with her

But you're still with her
But you're still with her

Oh, yes I hear what you're saying
But I'm afraid you're not staying
Because I'm not as naive as you believe

Oh, yes I hear what you're saying
But I'm afraid you're not staying
Because I'm not as naive as you believe

Oh, yes I hear what you're saying
But I'm afraid you're not staying
Because I'm not as naive as you believe
