NO CHRISTMAS

I wonder if you're going to ask me why I lied?
I wonder if you're going to show you're angry with me
I wonder if I could explain this if I tried
I wonder if I'm going to know when you forgive me

When you forgive me, you forgive me, you forgive me
Will you stay with me, you stay with me, you stay with me?

And all those awful things you said at first
Don't shout, I understand, you're pretending
To punish me, well I'm listening so do your worst
I don't doubt that you're mad but it can't be ending

It can't be ending, it can't be ending, can't be ending
You're still pretending, still pretending, still pretending

Don't say we've reached the end. You can't be right
For goodness sake you must know I care about you
Please stay my best friend one more night
I couldn't face another day alone without you

Alone without you, alone without you, alone without you
I care about you, I care about you, I care about you

Alone without you, alone without you, alone without you
I care about you, I care about you, I care about you
