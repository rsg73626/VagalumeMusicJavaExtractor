THE QUEEN OF OUTERSPACE

She's a mixed up girl from a very different world
She's come, come, come, come, to a yellow sun
Whe she began she was a man
Go, go, go, go like a dynamo

She's my colonel spider
You know she's a deep space rider
I feel beautiful beside her

She doesn't need air; she can breathe anywhere
Come, come, come, come, and you can have some
We like to chase through outer space
Go, go, go, go, you know

She's my colonel spider
You know she's a deep space rider
I feel beautiful beside her

She's my colonel spider
You know she's a deep space rider
I feel beautiful beside her
I feel wonderful beside her
