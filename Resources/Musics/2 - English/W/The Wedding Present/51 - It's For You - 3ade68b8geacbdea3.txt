IT'S FOR YOU

No, it’s for you but then you didn’t need me to say that 
‘Cos you already knew, how many times is it today that 
He’s had to call? It’s as if you’re still together 
I don’t care at all, I’m just wondering whether 
You think you and he will ever run out 
Of things that you have to talk about 

You said everything you will ever need so 
Why can’t you just let him go 

OK I lied, sometimes it’s like you never met me 
Oh I’ve really tried, but all those in-jokes just upset me 
Do you think you and he will ever run out 
Of things that you have to talk about 

You said everything you will ever need so 
Why can’t you just let him go 

Just tell him ‘goodbye’ and put down the phone 
And for once we can be on our own 
You think I’m making this up but darling it’s true 
It just feels as if I’m sharing you
