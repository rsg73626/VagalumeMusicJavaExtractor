ANYONE CAN

When I set foot on the bus you laughed & said: "that's the end for us!"
Oh could a joke ever go more wrong? if only you'd have come along
Oh but you must stop calling Jane, she is completely without blame
Do you have to ring her up so soon? that's rubbing salt into these wounds
A little bit of what you fancy doesn't do you any good at all
Oh I know that now
I can't add to what I've said, I just completely lost my head
Do you want me here when you start to pack? & are you leaving just like that?
Have you taken all you want? Is that it? Have you really gone?
What can I say to change your mind? There'll be another time
A little bit of what you fancy doesn't do you any good at all
It's so clear to me now
