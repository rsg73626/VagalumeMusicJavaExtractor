IT'S A GAS

The sun's already rising
I guess that's not surprising
Because I find you mesmerizing
We're moving fast
But kissing and caressing
And watching you undressing
Shouldn't be depressing
I know at last

That it's a gas
But my best friend's waiting
So I'm going to pass
But it's so frustrating

I know how you're feeling
Oh sure you're most appealing
But I'm not double dealing
We're moving fast
You've given me a fever
But I will not deceive her
I'm never going to leave her
I know at last

That it's a gas
But my best friend's waiting
So I'm going to pass
But it's so frustrating

The answer's no
I've got to go
Well I told you so
You won't use me
I couldn't do
What you want me to
Because I don't love you
You just amuse me (ohh)

I hope you're not offended (it's a gas)
Because I never pretended (it's a gas)
I guess this night just ended (it's a gas)
I know at last

It's a gas
I'm not hesitating
I'm just going to pass
But it's so frustrating

'cause it's such a gas
But my best friend's waiting for me now
