EVERYONE THINKS HE LOOKS DAFT

Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft
Oh why do you catch my eye, then turn away?
I thought we said all the things we had to say
Shaun said he saw you holding hands with your new friend
How does it feel to know you've just won again?

Don't give me that! Because you were seen!
Everyone thinks he looks daft but you can have your dream

Can I keep that book of yours and maybe this one too?
Oh sure, I'll bring them round tomorrow if that will do
Was it really full? They must have queued there since half past three
Oh I didn't go, was it a good film? Well that's just me!

Don't give me that! Because you were seen!
Everyone thinks he looks daft but you can have your dream

Guess who I saw by your old house just the other day
That kid we used to think was mad, but now he looks okay
I think someone's here, look out the window, I can't make out who
Oh I'd love to stay but I've really got so many things to do

Don't give me that! Because you were seen!
Everyone thinks he looks daft but you can have your dream
