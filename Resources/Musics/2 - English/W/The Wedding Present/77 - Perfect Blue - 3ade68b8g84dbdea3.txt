PERFECT BLUE

And when I turn round to glance at you, you’re staring 
Your eyes are such a perfect blue that I can’t look away 
Did I get shy maybe I didn’t make it clear 
Darling, I think I’ll always want you 

‘Cos when I’m away from you it’s like something’s missing 
That sounds drippy but I swear it’s true 
It just appeared and no it wasn’t rehearsed there really was no warning 
You’re the first thing in my head each morning 

The more I have, the more I want you 
The more you smile, the more I know that I’ll 
Never make you sad but I should warn you 
That I just might never let you out of my sight 

I’m not sure just what I did to deserve you 
I’m not complaining, God forbid, I just don’t understand 
Tell me why haven’t you had enough of me 
How have I managed to make you love me 

The more I have, the more I want you 
The more you smile, the more I know that I’ll 
Never make you sad but I should warn you 
That I just might never let you out of my sight
