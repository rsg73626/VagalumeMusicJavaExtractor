RINGWAY TO SEATAC

You ask me how I feel, well suddenly this is all for real 
It hasn’t seemed like that till now, it’s as if you were still mine somehow 
I hope you’ve realised just how I’m being so civilised 
But it’s nearly time I went, we’ve got one last chance to have an argument 

And watching you walk back to your car 
Was the lowest point of my life so far 

Don’t stare into my eyes, I couldn’t bear for you to realise 
That I’m still desperately in love with you and darling that’s all I can think of 
It’ll get easier every day, well I’ll be five thousand miles away 
And I’m good at hiding pain but now I really should get on that plane 

And watching you walk back to your car 
Was the lowest point of my life so far 

As if you still could ever do a single thing 
That’d make me hate you
