NIAGARA

Oh no my life had not begun
Until your call, was it only yesterday?
I can't believe the things we've done
Since then, and God, I love the way you taste

But does it have to end right now?
Well can't you stay for another day?
Just say you're ill and come back out
I'll meet you here, then we'll disappear

I've got this feeling, oh it's like nothing I know
You've sent me reeling, and I don't want you to go

Don't say a word it's almost light
I'll always remember how you look right now
We must have talked and talked all night
All I heard was Niagara falling down

I've got this feeling, oh it's like nothing I know
You've sent me reeling, and I don't want you to go
