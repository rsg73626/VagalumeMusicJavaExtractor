NOT FROM WHERE I'M STANDING

Oh well of course I shouldn't be here watching people row
But it's just so scary knowing each word before it comes out of her mouth
And now that the moment's here, when she tells him to go
And I pulled that very same face just seven days ago

And if I could live one day again
That day would be the one

And when he tells her it's all lies, she's making patterns with her spoon
And when he looks into her eyes, she's staring round the room
He's told for once and all that it's not just in her head
And now he's starting to take back all those things he said

And if I could live one day again
That day would be the one


And if I could live one day again
That day would be the one
And if I could live one day again
That day would be the one
