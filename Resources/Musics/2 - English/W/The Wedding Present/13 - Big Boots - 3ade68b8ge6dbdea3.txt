BIG BOOTS

I know you've put those big boots on because they're kind of scary
You're an Amazon, you're a mercenary
And your boyfriend's gone, but I'm still far too wary of you 

I don't know why because my body's aching
You only have to sigh and, well, my hands start shaking
Oh, I've got to try, because my heart is breaking in two
It's just that I don't know what to do 

You scare me stiff
You scare me stiff 

You like to play, it's true, that's why you're always winning
Well I could do that too, just let me start at the beginning
Because I'm just as good as you, when my head isn't spinning like this 

Because you don't know me, there is no reason why you should do
But there are things I've got to see, and if you want to come, you could do
You say that you agree, but if I walk away now, would you be sad
Or would you just think "That's too bad"? 

You scare me stiff
You scare me stiff 

You scare me stiff
You scare me stiff
