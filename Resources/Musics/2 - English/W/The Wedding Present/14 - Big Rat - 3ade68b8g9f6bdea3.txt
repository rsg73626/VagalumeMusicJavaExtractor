BIG RAT

And there's something I've got
To tell you and I'm not
Sure how to put it in words
I had a feeling you might
Have guessed that something's not right
Maybe you've already heard

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Oh please don't start crying
I've not been lying
I just didn't tell you it all
We just talked but then she
Stopped smiling when she
Asked me to give her a call

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

I'm a big rat, but I get scared 
When you start talking like that
Why won't you see that she meant 
Absolutely nothing to me

I can't remember just what
Happened next but I'm not
Sure I even had any fun
Oh, she's amusing...
But I was so scared of losing you, well
After all that I've done

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

I'm a big rat, but I get scared 
When you start talking like that
Why don't you see that she meant 
Absolutely nothing to me

I'm a big rat, but I get scared 
When you start talking like that
Oh why can't you see that she meant 
Absolutely nothing to me
