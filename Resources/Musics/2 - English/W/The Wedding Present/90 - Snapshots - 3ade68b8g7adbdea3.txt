SNAPSHOTS

I really don’t have any right to complain in this way 
My life here isn’t so bad, I’m almost embarrassed to say 
When I think of all the pain you had to go through 
I was going insane thinking well what can I do 

I have no right to feel self-pity like this 
It all still seems unreal, baby I miss 
The things you say, the friend you became 
To me you’ll always stay exactly the same 

And that’s 
Beautiful forever 
How strange to think you’ll never 
Have to worry about growing old, about 
Counting wrinkles and the winter cold, again 

In the middle of the night there’s hardly a sound 
As if everything’s all right and you’re still around 
You were young and strong and completely carefree 
And it seems so wrong that you’ll always be 

Beautiful forever 
How strange to think you’ll never 
Have to worry about growing old, about 
Counting wrinkles and the winter cold, again
