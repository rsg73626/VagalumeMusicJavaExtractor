MARS SPARKLES DOWN ON ME

So here I've got my brand new girlfriend
And she's great in every way
And you've got your new lover there
So I guess we're both okay

And I know that we've been through this
And we have to be apart
But the thought of him lying in our bed with you
It still just breaks my heart

Mars sparkles down
On me

You say he wants to meet me
Oh, I'm sure he's genuine
But how can I just shake his hand?
When it's been all over your skin

Mars sparkles down
On me

I should stop calling on our wind
But I won't
I know I really should consider him
But I don't
