MOTHERS

It's really not the ... ...
Step on other people's feet
Now it must be ...ing
'Cos you were going out with him
'Cos you were going out with him

Wasn't meant to drag him down

For him to take it out on me
'Cos you were going out with him
For him to take it out on me
'Cos part of him is still with you
