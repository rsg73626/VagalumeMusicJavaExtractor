DON'T LAUGH

I never thought I could live here on my own
But then I guess everybody'got to live somewhere
Four tins of paint made this our home
Oh I got less on the walls than I got in my hair

When we moved in here the dog was still a pup
Oh do you remember the time he chewed those curtains that we found?
I laughed the day you put them up
The day you left I tore them down

Don't laugh, don't even sigh
I touched your skin last night
But your half of the bed was empty
And so I guess I must have dreamt it
I don't know why
Don't laugh, don't even try
I touched your skin last night
I didn't fall asleep til morning
And then the next day I couldn't stop yawning
Oh how I try

And these bedroom walls are paper thin
You took a side in every neighbor's row
And those kids next door make such a din
But sitting here it seems ever so quiet now
