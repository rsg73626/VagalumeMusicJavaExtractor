SPORTS CAR

It's okay, I know you've got to go
Because he's walked in the room
Oh, I heard the sports car shrieking
And you, don't want him to know
Who's on the 'phone with you
No, I can tell by the way you're speaking

When you say "I think it's got to end"
Is it just another whim?
Oh, don't forget how well I know you
But I am not going to pretend
That I get along with him
Because, well, I don't have to

And I am not going to call
There's no reason at all
And I am not going to call
There's no reason at all

And if you get in his car
Go somewhere very far
If you get in his car
Go somewhere very far
