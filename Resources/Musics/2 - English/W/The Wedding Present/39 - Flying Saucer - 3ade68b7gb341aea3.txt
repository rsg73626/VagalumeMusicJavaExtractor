FLYING SAUCER

She waited there just like she said she would
But it was all too much when she said she loved me
I felt right there and then as if I could
Reach out and touch the stars above me

And I surrender
I can't forget her
I still remember
Every word she said

And I want her
She kind of launched a
Flying saucer
Right inside my head

There are a lot of thigns I thought I'd never do
But one look in her eyes and I knew what I was missing
That's why I thought I'd come and talk to you
Oh well you seems so wise, but I'm not even listening

Because my fireball
Is going to call
It's getting late
he knows I'll wait
Oh I surrender
I can't forget her
I still remember
Every word she said

She got me spinning
From the beginning
I see her face
In outer space
Oh I want her
She kind of launched a
Flying saucer
Right inside my head
