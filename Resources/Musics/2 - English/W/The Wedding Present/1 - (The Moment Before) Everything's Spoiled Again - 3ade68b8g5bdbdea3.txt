(THE MOMENT BEFORE) EVERYTHING'S SPOILED AGAIN

Have I said something wrong?
How can I know if you're not going to speak to me?
There I am, in your eyes
We're only playing, but what am I saying?
What am I saying?
What am I saying?

"Oh there's no one like you
No one like that now
There's always some way
That you could bring me down

Maybe it's just that I fly too high 
But the ground is hard (it always hurts me) 
When I fall over sideways and break out in sores 
And people start laughing; but it's not what I'm into

I don't expect you to know
I don't expect you to know

And when the sound of your laughter is getting too hard 
and people start staring, but nowhere is better than 
Lying down here with you 
And no one is supposed to know how I feel, but
I don't expect you to know
I don't expect you to know

It's just that I don't want you to go
It's just that I don't want you to go

Don't leave me alone again
I never wanted that again
Don't leave me alone again
I never wanted that again
