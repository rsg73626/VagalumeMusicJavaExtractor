SWIMMING POOLS MOVIE STARS

I'll stand over here and when
You walk past me again I'll try and say "hello"
It doesn't look like you are here with anyone
Maybe they've already gone, oh I don't know

I've thought of nothing else today
The things I'd love to say if I got the chance
And oh, how grateful I would be
If you could just give me a second glance

And that's because tonight
I've seen you in a different light
Bunny girls and motor cars
Swimming pools and movie stars

Just don't amuse me anymore
And I'm not even sure I liked them then
I feel like I'm awakening
And I'll do anything, please just say when!

Oh it's all because tonight
I've seen you in a different light
Bunny girls and motor cars
Swimming pools and movie stars

They can keep it
They can keep it all
If only you would call

Tonight I've seen you in a different light
Bunny girls and motor cars
Swimming pools and movie stars

They can keep it
They can keep it all
If only you would call

Yes they can keep it
They can keep it all
If only you would call
