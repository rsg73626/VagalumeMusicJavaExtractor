KANSAS

If none of this was ever planned
That explains why I don't understand
Come on, you must agree that this is strange
Well how can everything just change? 

And now, I know that you are going to laugh
But I've just got to take a photograph
Because I've never seen you look this way
And you've not told me yet if I can stay 

I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure
But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore 
I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure
But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore

Push your fingers deep inside
Don't stop until you're satisfied
I can't tell you just how good that feels
Just close your eyes and tap your heels

I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure
But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure
But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore 
I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure

But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure
But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
I don't care where this lands us, I'm sure
But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
