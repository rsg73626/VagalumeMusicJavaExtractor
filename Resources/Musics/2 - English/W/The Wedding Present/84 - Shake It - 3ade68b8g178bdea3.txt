SHAKE IT

I've been through this already
And I don't care what you've seen
I've changed so much since then
You want to take it steady, sure
But how long does that mean?!
Don't go home again

Why don't you keep your eyes closed
And just take a giant bite
What makes you so scared?
Well, I guessed he just supposed that
You'd be sleeping here tonight
I don't think he really cared

Now won't you please give in
And say you'll stay
You can't win if you won't play

Shake it, you've got to shake it
We've got to make it, make it tonight
Undress me, darling, caress me
I'll die unless we make it tonight

There's so much I need to tell you
But I just can't find the words
I've never felt like this before
And if I say "I love you"
You pretend that you've not heard
What are you waiting for?

Oh won't you please give in
And say you'll stay
You can't win if you won't play

Shake it, you've got to shake it
We've got to make it, make it tonight
Undress me, darling, caress me
I'll die unless we make it tonight

Shake it, you've got to shake it
We've got to make it, make it tonight
Undress me, darling, caress me
I'll die unless we make it tonight
