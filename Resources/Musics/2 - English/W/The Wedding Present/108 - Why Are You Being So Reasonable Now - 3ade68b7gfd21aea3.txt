WHY ARE YOU BEING SO REASONABLE NOW

You've never mentioned this before
It seems I'm always the last to know
And do I have to guess how you're going to feel each day
You never have a word to say
You should have told me
I don't understand why you didn't tell me

Surely you must know I hate what I'm doing
I don't want to upset you but it's yourself you're foo
The last thing I need is part twelve of the row
But just why are you being so reasonable now?

I don't dare answer the phone
And when you call I still pretend that I'm not home
I don't want to see you anymore
Oh love, it's just not me I'm thinking of
No one can change that much in three days
It's not yours to take back?

Surely you must know I hate what I'm doing
I don't want to upset you but it's yourself you're fooling
The last thing I need is part twelve of the row
But just why are you being so reasonable now?

How can you do this to me
How can you do this to me
How can you do this to me
How can you do this to me
