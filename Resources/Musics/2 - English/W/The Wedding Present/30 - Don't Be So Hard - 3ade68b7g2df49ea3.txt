DON'T BE SO HARD

Don't Be So Hard
He became a man a twenty-three
And now he's got to take up all the seat
I never knew he was so bold
I really think she should be told
But that's what best friends are for
And does she have a best friend, anymore?
At home, she tells him little lies
Like she's not in the mood tonight

And when they're out with all his friends
He just forgets that she's even there

He's got his name on peoples lips
He crushes fingers in his grip
And of course he shows that he doesn't care
If he chances to overhear
"Have you seen her without makeup?"
And "I don't think he's had much luck!"
At home, she tells him little lies
Like onions always make her cry

And when they're out with all his friends
He just forgets that she's even there
