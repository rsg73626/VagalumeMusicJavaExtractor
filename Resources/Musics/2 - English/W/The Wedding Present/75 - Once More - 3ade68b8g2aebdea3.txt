ONCE MORE

A gang of thieves, somebody leaves
I swear I heard laughter
An empty gloom and some forbidden room
And a window to shatter

And does your heart begin to fail
When the moment gets closer?
You always turn the other way
But it doesn't really matter at all
It doesn't really matter at all, oh no

A crashing blow, does somebody know?
They must've heard my heart beating
And we're in tonight but there'll be a fight
Can you tell what I'm thinking?

And does your heart begin to fail
When the moment gets closer?
You always turn the other way
But it doesn't really matter at all
It doesn't really matter at all, oh no

Once more
Oh I know that I've said this before
Oh but this time I'm changing for sure
Just let me go out there
Once more

Oh I know that I've said this before
Oh but this time I'm changing for sure
Just let me go out there
Once more. Once more

Once more
Oh I know that I've said this before
Oh but this time I'm changing for sure
Just let me go out there
Just let me go out there again
Just let me go out there again

Once more, just let me go out there once more
Once more
