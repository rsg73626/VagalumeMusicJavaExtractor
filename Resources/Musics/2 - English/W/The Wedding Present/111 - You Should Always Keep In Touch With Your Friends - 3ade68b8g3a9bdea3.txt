YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRIENDS

After school, a friendship walking home
We fled across the fields, until we were alone
To a bridge, that stood close by the sea
The day that we spent there, is ours eternally

I don't have to tell you
I'm sure you understand
The first who lay beside me
Made me what I am (oh, she made me what I am)

A smile, in these ungrateful times
Makes all that you left me seem more worthwhile
But no, I couldn't really dare
To show how much I miss you
Isn't that unfair?

I don't have to tell you
I'm sure you understand
The first who lay beside me
Made me what I am (oh you made me what I am)

And no matter how it ends
You should always keep in touch with your friends
