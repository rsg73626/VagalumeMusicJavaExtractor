GAZEBO

I knew it was you from the minute
You strolled into the gazebo like you'd never been gone
And if this is a game, well you'll win it
Oh, there were others, but you're still the first one
Your chair's right there, I guess you've seen it
It's funny how the years have gone and slipped away
Oh, but you haven't changed a bit...no, I mean it!
And you still say things that no one else would say

Oh, sure, you amused me
But you also confused me
Then you turned round and used me
I thought I'd forget you
I didn't want to upset you
So you went and I let you

You wouldn't believe all the time that I've wasted
Staring at the photographs you sent to me
But I remember, oh, exactly how you tasted
And just how much you really meant to me
Oh no, I'm seeing someone here, you don't know her
She's one in a million but she isn't you
And it could never be, well, quite as close as we were
I hate to say it, but I think it's true

Oh, sure, you amused me
But you also confused me
Then you turned round and used me
I thought I'd forget you
I didn't want to upset you
So you went and I let you
