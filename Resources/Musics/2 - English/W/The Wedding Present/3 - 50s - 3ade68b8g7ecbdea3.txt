50S

I've tried getting you out of my mind
But I just seem to sit and dream of things that I've left behind
She swears that she's in love with me
And that's what I'm scared of, because this is a love that never was meant to be

I said "I'm over it now"
"We'll make it somehow"
But then, as I came
Oh I cried out your name 

I know I've made a huge mistake
Suddenly, thanks to me, there's another big heart to break
I'm yearning for you to say that we're
Meant to be, "Come back to me" are words that I long to hear 

I said "I'm over it now"
"We'll make it somehow"
But then, as I came
Oh I cried out your name 

I've tried to forget
I haven't managed it yet
I lied because I knew
That I only want you
