YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH

I really don't believe that this is happening
I've tried and tried and tried to think it through
Oh, I heard what you said, I'm just not answering
I guess I'm scared of what I'll have to do

Because you know that I'll come running to you, when you call
You know I'll come whatever you've got planned
You know you mix me up, I can't think straight at all
My head tells me I shouldn't be here and my heart says "yeah!"

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You've hypnotised me with those crazy eyes of yours
You've cracked me open like a coconut
You've got me crawlin' round and round you on all fours
My head tells me I shouldn't be here but my heart says "yeah!"

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I want you now, let's just take it all the way
I don't care how, I'll do anything you say
I want you now, let's just take it all the way
I don't care how, I'll do anything you say

And how on earth did I get myself into this?
And how much stranger is it going to get?
And how do you hold me prisoner with just a kiss?
My head tells me I shouldn't be here yet my heart says "yeah!"

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

My heart says "yeah!"

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yes yes yes yes yes
