YOU CAN'T MOAN CAN YOU?

I was just trying to hide a yawn
I think I've noticed that its dawn
But I'll stay longer if you want

She just caught you off your guard
And I know it can be hard
But that's really not the point

Well, just try to get away
Go and see your parents for a day
That's what I'd do myself

She is not the only one
And its easier said than done
But try and think of something else

You have got everything that you need
