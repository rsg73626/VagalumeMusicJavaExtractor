SILVER SHORTS

She's not talking to me now
Not since we had our row
But I don't care what lies ahead
I just can't get out of your bed

I know what I said
I just changed my mind
I can't leave you behind
Just keep on doing what you were
Before I mentioned her

Wear your silver shorts today
And I won't go away
The thoughts you put inside my head
Yes, I'll stay here instead

I know what I said
I just changed my mind
I can't leave you behind
Just keep on doing what you were
Before I mentioned her
