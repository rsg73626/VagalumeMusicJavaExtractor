JET GIRL

Oh I could call you now
But I know you won't answer
Because someone told me how it always ends 

I guess that you could say
I took a great big chance and
Now you've flown away
Are we still friends? 

You took off like a jet, girl
Somehow I knew that it would happen all along
Oh, but I can bet, girl
Wherever you are, you won't be landing there for long 

Unless I'm wrong 

Oh, I know I've been blind
You only hung around to
See what you could find to turn you on 

And I could have ignored
The aura that surrounds you
But I'd have been so bored
And you'd still be gone 

You took off like a jet, girl
Somehow I knew that it would happen all along
Oh, but I can bet, girl
Wherever you are, you won't be landing there for long 

You took off like a jet, girl
Somehow I knew that it would happen all along
Oh, but I can bet, girl
Wherever you are, you won't be landing there for long 

Unless I'm wrong
