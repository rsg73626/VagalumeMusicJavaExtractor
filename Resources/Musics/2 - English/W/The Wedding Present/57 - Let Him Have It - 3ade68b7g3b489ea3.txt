LET HIM HAVE IT

Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him

I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't really care enough about it
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't really care enough about it
The light is getting dim

Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him

You don't want me
You don't need me
You don't really care enough about me
You don't want me
You don't need me
You don't really care enough about me
The light is getting dim

Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him

I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't really care enough about it
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't really care enough about it
The light is getting dim, give it to him
The light is getting dim

Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him
Give it to him
