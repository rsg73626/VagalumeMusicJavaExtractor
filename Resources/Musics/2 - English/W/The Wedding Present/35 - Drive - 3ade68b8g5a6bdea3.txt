DRIVE

You drive, no, no, I want you to
Because I've only one thing on my mind
And I don't dare
Don't these bends hold any fear for you?
Well my friends are suddenly all left behind
But I don't care 

If you're driving, I'll go
And I don't care where
In fact I'd rather not know
Just tell me when we get there 

You're fast, I have no doubt of it
It's a blast and I would go anywhere with you
Just say
Don't stop, don't even consider it
You're on top and girl that is just where I want you
To stay 

If you're driving, I'll go
And I don't care where
In fact I'd rather not know
Just tell me when we get there 

If you're driving, I'll go
And I don't care where
In fact I'd rather not know
Just tell me when we get there 

If you're driving, I'll go
And I don't care where
In fact I'd rather not know
Just tell me when we get there 

If you're driving, I'll go
And I don't care where
In fact I'd rather not know
Let's just go
