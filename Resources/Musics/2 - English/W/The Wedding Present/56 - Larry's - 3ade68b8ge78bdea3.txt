LARRY'S

It was here in this aisle that I first heard her talking 
And for a second or two I could have sworn it was you 
Her hair, her smile, the way she was walking 
Was exactly the same, I nearly called out your name 
And though I knew it couldn’t have possibly been you 
Oh I still stared for as long as I dared 

Now I’m here everyday ‘cos you look like some housewife 
If it sounds stupid, yes, I admit I’m a mess 
But you were near me for eighteen years of my life 
I’m not getting upset – it’s just a lot to forget 

Sure I need to learn to live without you 
I always thought I’d have you here by my side 
I’ve begun but believe me, it’s easier said than done 
When you leave I think the world is mine 
And there’s nothing I can’t do 
But I really know that I’m still doing it all for you
