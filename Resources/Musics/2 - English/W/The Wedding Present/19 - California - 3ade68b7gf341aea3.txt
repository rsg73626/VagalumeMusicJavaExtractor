CALIFORNIA

Let's go to California now
We've got to cross this great big world somehow
Don't say "no"
We must go

You're scared you'll make some big mistake, but I forgive you
This is a risk you have to take, and I'll be with you
And I'll hold you
I told you

Leave all your cares and fears behind
There should be one thing on your mind
Don't say "no"
We must go

Don't put any clothes back on
That's just how
I'll remember this day when we've gone
But right now...

That's just the weirdest thing I've ever heard
Oh but I'm ready, just say the word
And I'll hold you
I told you

Anything you want to do
I just know
That I'll want to do it too
But we must go

Anything you want to do
I just know
That I'll want to do it to you
But we must go
