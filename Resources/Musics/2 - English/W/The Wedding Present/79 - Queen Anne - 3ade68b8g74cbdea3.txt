QUEEN ANNE

When you push your hair away and stare at me with sleepy eyes 
I get a feeling here, a feeling I don’t recognise 
I wanna give you everything 
I’ve been in love but this is worse 

I want to cling to you and save you from the universe 
‘Cos I have fallen in a way I’ve never done before 
You’re all I need today I don’t want anything more 
As unlikely as it seems, it’s as if you’ve just appeared 
Out of one of my dreams - I don’t care if that sounds weird 
‘Cos you’re beautiful, and yet completely unaware 

Oh sure I miss my home but I’d live with you anywhere 
‘Cos I have fallen in a way I’ve never done before 
You’re all I need today I don’t want anything more 
As unlikely as it seems, it’s as if you’ve just appeared 
Out of one of my dreams - I don’t care if that sounds weird
