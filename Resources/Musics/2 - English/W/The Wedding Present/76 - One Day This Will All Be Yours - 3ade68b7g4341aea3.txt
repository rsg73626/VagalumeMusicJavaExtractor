ONE DAY THIS WILL ALL BE YOURS

And they were left all alone
On that fateful day the budgie had a stroke
1940's bliss...how could it come to this?

Forgotten things they once knew
And now there's really only one thing left to do
But I think that I'm more scared
Because this country doesn't care

And one day this will all be yours
And one day this will all be yours
And one day this will all be yours
And one day this will all be yours

But there were bluer skies
When you were just a twinkle in our eyes
Oh but you don't have to stay
But thank you anyway
