BLUE EYES

I don't think I've ever mentioned this before
But I couldn't possibly love you anymore
Oh, it's been ages
Let's not do that again

I think you said that when you wrote to me
But I'm not as certain as I ought to be
I lost the pages
It didn't seem to matter then

There's a lot of things I should have kept
But there was so much I could not accept

I watched some film round Alexandra's place
But I kept seeing your blue eyes in her face
I tried to call you
You must have left by then

And you know that stuff about your being here?
I changed my mind, no, I just want you near
I don't have to own you
I just want you home again

There's a lot of things I used to say
But that all changes from today
