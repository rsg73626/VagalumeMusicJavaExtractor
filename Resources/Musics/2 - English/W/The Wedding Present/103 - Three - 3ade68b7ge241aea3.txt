THREE

Yes. I want to, I'm down here on my knees
Well why can't you just think about it please?

I'm yours
She's mine
Two's company
But three have a better time
We've got a mountain to climb

You're so right, we get what we deserve
And that's just why, you've got to have some nerve

I'm yours
She's mine
Two's company
But three have a better time
We've got a mountain to climb

There's no hurry, we can make this slow
And don't worry, no one has to know

I'm yours
She's mine
Two's company
But three have a better time
We've got a mountain to climb
We're going to have a good time
And it isn't a crime
