GO, MAN, GO

By the time you read this
I will be a world away
I decided I can't stay
I'm leaving, there, well now you know
I warned you I might go
But what I didn't mention then
Is that I'm never coming back again

Because it's go, man, go
Go, man, go
Go, man, go

Don't cry, I'm sorry it's "Goodbye"
But my life's ground to a halt
And, no, it's not your fault
I'm leaving, what else should I do?
And I'm still in love with you
But please don't ask me when
Because I'm never coming back again

And it's go, man, go
Go, man, go
Go, man, go

I'm never ever coming back again
And it's go, man, go
Go, man, go
Go, man, go
Go, man, go
