GO GO DANCER

Here comes my go-go dancer
I called out but she wouldn't answer, oh, I don't know
She's changed ever since I met her
New friend but I won't forget her, can't let her go

I don't believe that's all she needs now
She used to have big dreams but somehow
They seem to mean less everyday
She wants to trhow it all away

I love to watch you when you dance
Could you still feel that way?
Should we start a new romance?

I watched them walking home together
Even on their own she never talks much at all
I don't know what she sees in you, boy
I think you're just another new toy, walk then you crawl

I love to watch you when you dance
Could you still feel that way?
Should we start a new romance?
