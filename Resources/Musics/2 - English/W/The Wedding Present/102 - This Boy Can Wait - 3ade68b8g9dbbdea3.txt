THIS BOY CAN WAIT

Let me stay and talk with you and John
We could laugh and tell jokes all night long
Another glass and I'm sure I could explain
But you could maybe guess that I've got to see your friend again

Oh yes I know it's late, oh but this boy can wait
This boy can wait
Oh there's nothing more that you could do
I've just got to see this through

My heart beats so fast whenever you are near
My tongue gets tied up whenever you can hear
When I touch your hand why do we have to hide behind these doors?
If the world doesn't understand, then the world has got to learn

Oh yes I know it's late, oh but this boy can wait
This boy can wait
Oh there's nothing more that you could do
I've just got to see this through

Tonight, when I hold you in my arms
And I prove that I'm a man
Oh well I hope you understand
