LOVE MACHINE

You are obscene
But I'm not your love machine
Turn it off, turn it on
Now you're here, now you're gone

You haven't changed
Oh I bet this was all arranged
And much as I'd like to watch the show
Something inside tells me to go

Love machine
I'm not your love machine
I'm not your love machine
I'm not your love machine

You walked out the door
You knew what you were looking for
But that's just you, always the same
Somehow I knew I'd get the blame

Because I was your tool
Well didn't you need a lovesick fool?
Then I turn round and you were gone
I bet you've found another one

Oh, so?
You made your mind up weeks ago
And now there's someone else that you don't know

You don't give up
But we won't be making up
Once I would've had you back
You really should've thought of that

Because it's not just the same
Well now it's a different game
You're home again, you've had a row
But that was then and this is now

Oh, so?
You made your mind up weeks ago
And now there's someone else that you don't know

Oh, so?
It wasn't me who said they had to go
And now there's someone else that you don't know
