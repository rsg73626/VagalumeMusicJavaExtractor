CATWOMAN

No I'll just lie here in your warm fur
Oh look, I'm trembling still
I didn't mean to hurt her
Oh but I guess I will

Because the pussycat in you
Brings out the man in me

Oh no I told her last night
She said: "I don't care!" (I'm joking, of course)
But you know something's not right
Well, for a start, I don't feel any remorse

But how can I resist
When she doesn't even know you exist?

You know I never made love
Like that before
There's nothing else to think of
I just want more and more

Because the pussycat in you
Brings out the man in me
Hey!
