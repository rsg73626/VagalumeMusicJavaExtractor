NEVER SAID

I haven't heard this song in years
It never fails to start the tears
A country lane and the smell of pine
A stripey blouse and some cheap English wine
And my dad's car would never start
But one phone call rescued two love hearts
And did I splash mud on your coat
Yeah you wore mine and I got cold

Just what went wrong? 
You never said just what went wrong
You never said just what went wrong

We've got some good friends still in Manchester
Sometimes I think I'd like to live back there
Oh that was just embarrassing
At times I say the most stupid things
And then your name's still mentioned next to mine
That's what you hated at the time
I know I said that it just couldn't last
But people get used to things so fast

Just what went wrong? 
You never said just what went wrong

I've walked behind you for more than an hour
I don't even think that I know this part of town
I think I'm trying to find a way to talk to you again
I think I'm trying to find a way to bring you back again
Oh won't you please come back again
