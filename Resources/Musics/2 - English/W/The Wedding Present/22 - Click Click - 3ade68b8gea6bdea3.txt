I really need to ask you whether
You and I can sleep together
I guess I never thought it mattered
Now, suddenly, I'm feeling flattered

Here's every last bit of me
No inbetween
Just take whatever you see
I need you to love me
And no one could mean
As much as you do to me

Come to me
I want to breathe the air that you breathe
Come to me
I want to follow you when you leave
Come to me
I want to take you home and hide you
Come to me
I always want to be inside you

Every last bit of me
No inbetween
Just take whatever you see
I need you to love me
And no one could mean
As much as you do to me

Every last bit of me
No inbetween
Just take whatever you see
I need you to love me
And no one could mean
As much as you do to me
