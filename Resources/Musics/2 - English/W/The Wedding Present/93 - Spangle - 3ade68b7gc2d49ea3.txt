SPANGLE

I'm glad you found the time to ring
Oh, no, I just spent all day waiting
I need to know what's happening
Well, at least we both agree

I really don't know where to start
Well, did you say you met some neighbour
I guess I'm heading for a broken heart
Why are you doing this to me?

It's all clear, I can hear
And I'm not going to share you with no one
Well surprise, I've got eyes
Now goodbye

How long have you had this planned?
I guess it shows how much you care
No, I understand
I just played the fool

Oh, sure I'm going to let you go
Well I was wrong to ever trust you
But I don't think that I'll ever know
How you could be so cruel

It's all clear, I can hear
And I'm not going to share you with no one
Well surprise, I've got eyes
Now goodbye

It's all clear, I can hear
And I'm not going to share you with no one
Well surprise, I've got eyes
Now goodbye
