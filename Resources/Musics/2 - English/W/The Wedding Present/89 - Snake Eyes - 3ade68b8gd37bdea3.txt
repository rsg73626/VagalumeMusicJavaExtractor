SNAKE EYES

And stop saying that I can't understand
And stop pretending that you aren't underhand
Don't look surprised
Don't look surprised 

Because I know who you're screwing
Yeah, I found out
So tell me, what are you doing?
But without those big fat lies
Those big snake eyes 

How could you lie there and hold me
When you knew there was something you hadn't told me?
Yes it's true, don't look surprised
Don't look surprised 

You don't stop loving someone just like that
I know exactly what I've lost and I want it back
Without those lies
Those big snake eyes 

When will I hear that I am losing you?
When will I hear that I am losing you?
When will I hear that I am losing you?
When will I hear that I am losing you?
