ALWAYS THE QUIET ONE

When I held back the doors and accidentally my hand touched yours - you smiled 
But if my voice sounded unsteady it’s because by then I was already beguiled 
And I knew as the rain beat down outside 
There was nowhere else to hide 
You were going to have to speak to me 

As we sheltered there together and talked inanely about the weather - I thought 
How it would be obligatory to ask for your number if this was a story - but it’s not 

And so, I watch you walk away 
And then waste my whole day 
Imagining the things you do 
Like how you’re bound to love quiet men 
And if we meet again, how I’d actually speak to you 

Here’s the funny part, I wouldn’t know where to start 
That’s cos I’m always the quiet one, you’ve already gone
