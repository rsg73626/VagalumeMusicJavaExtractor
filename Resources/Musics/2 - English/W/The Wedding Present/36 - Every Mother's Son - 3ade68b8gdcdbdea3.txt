EVERY MOTHER'S SON

You could hardly hope to please me
You haven't got that voice
A man just needs his mother back
A woman's got a choice
A little boy means strife and joy
In sickness and in health
A man's got to have his mother back
A woman's got herself, oh a woman's got herself

Will you help me, will you hold me
Will you miss me when I've gone?
A woman's got to have her mother's boy
So that her man is on his own
Will you excuse my little weakness
Will you tell me, "That's all right"
A woman's got to have her mother's boy
So that her man comes back each night
Oh that man comes home each night
