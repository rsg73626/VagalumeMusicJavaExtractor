2, 3, GO

So the right answer is
To dispense with these formalities
We can't possibly fail
Because we can lick thirty tigers today
If you're inclined 

I know you won't refuse
Because you agree there is nothing to lose
We're two of a kind
Don't look behind 

You're still doubtful but I've
Seen adventures like this one arrive
So many times
You've just got to learn how
‘cos the future is starting right now
Oh, I just know
You are ready to go 

Make a movie today
Buy a red Chevrolet
Let's go swim the Zambezi
Let's do it just ‘cos it's easy 

Sometimes if we just wait
For the right moment it comes far too late
Oh, I just know
You are ready to go 

Ride white horses today
Buy a red Chevrolet
Let's go swim the Zambezi
Let's do it just ‘cos it's easy 

Let's fly close to the sun
Let's do it just ‘cos it's fun
Let's go swim the Zambezi
Let's do it just ‘cos it's easy 

Make a movie today
Buy a red Chevrolet
Let's go swim the Zambezi
Let's do it just ‘cos it's easy
