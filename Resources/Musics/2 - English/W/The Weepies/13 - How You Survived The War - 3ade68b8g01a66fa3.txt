HOW YOU SURVIVED THE WAR

You never change your mind
Once it's made up
Unless it's to crawl back on your knees

Is that the way you wanted?
You get back to the wall and put your hands up
It's a hold up
You give up like every time before
That is how you survived the war

You rarely multiply
Always division
You give yourself the least of parts
I put on my green felt hat
Like our provisions
Playing a merry prince of fears

Is that the way you wanted?
You get back to the wall and put your hands up
It's a hold up
You give up like every time before
That is how you survived the war

You're not gonna lose this one
You don't have to cut and run
I think you can choose to love and what is more
That is how you survived the war

Now in a summer's day
Spring of ripe and plum
How will you live under the sun?
You follow the open road
Remembering the guns
When you get lost under the trees

Is that the way you wanted?
You get back to the wall and put your hands up
It's a hold up
You give up like every time before
That is how you survived the war (x2)

You never change your mind
Once it's made up
