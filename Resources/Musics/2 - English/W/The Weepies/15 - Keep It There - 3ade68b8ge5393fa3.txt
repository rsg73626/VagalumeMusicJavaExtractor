KEEP IT THERE

Got three dollars burning in my pocket, I know I know
Got three dollars burning in my pocket, I know I know
I got, I got, I got to keep it there.

Got an old ghost locked in my closet, I know I know
Got an old ghost locked in my closet, I know I know
I got, I got, I got to keep it there.

Came down on a bottle rocket
Found my heart right where I locked it
Last night like rain on chalk
It's gone like money in my pocket.

See those stars shining in your eyes and I know I know
See those stars shining in your eyes and I know I know
I got, I got, I got to keep it there.

Came down on a bottle rocket
Found my heart right where I locked it
Last night like rain on chalk
It's gone like money in my pocket.

All my troubles in the rear view mirror, I know I know
All my troubles in the rear view mirror, I know I know
I got, I got, I got to keep them there.
