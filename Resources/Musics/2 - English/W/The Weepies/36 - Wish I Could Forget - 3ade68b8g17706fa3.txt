WISH I COULD FORGET

Do you disapprove
Alright you've made your point
You don't have to choose right now
I don't have the time to step into that joint
No one wants to see my face there anyhow

Monday come like Tuesday
You were something else I will admit
I remember what you told me
I only wish I could forget
I only wish I could forget

Standing in the sun
Smoking quiet cigarettes
Just before I let you down
Funny how a heart shatters all at once
Seems like it should make a sound

Monday come like Tuesday
You were something else I will admit
I remember what you told me
I only wish I could forget
I only wish I could forget

Too much to ask
Just one kiss
You'll never know
What I'm gonna miss
Yes I'm getting old
Wandering this way
Wondering what's wrong and right
Traveled alone but the traffic holds it still
Did I lose the will to fight

Monday come like Tuesday
You were something else I will admit
I remember what you told me
I only wish I could forget
I only wish I could forget
