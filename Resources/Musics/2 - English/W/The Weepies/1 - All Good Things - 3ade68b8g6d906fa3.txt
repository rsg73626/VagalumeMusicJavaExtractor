ALL GOOD THINGS

Not sure where to go
Everybody I know says I'm too forgiving
And now that I'm gone,
I don't want to move on
I just keep reliving

All good things, oh I wish you
All good things come to an end
All good things, oh I wish you well

Lost inside of my head, empty side of the bed
I feel this place without you
I keep pushing the bruise
'Cause I don't want to lose what I loved about you

All good things, oh I wish you
All good things come to an end
All good things, oh I wish you well

I could think of a million ways
You proved you weren't the one
So live inside of your shades of gray
And never mind the sunshine that I'll find

I've got so much space now
I got a whole house with the wind blowing through
I don't need somewhere to hide
I've got this whole world inside
I was accustomed to showing you...

All good things, oh I wish you
All good things come to an end
All good things, oh I wish you well
All good things, oh, oh
All good things, oh, oh
All good things, oh I wish you well
