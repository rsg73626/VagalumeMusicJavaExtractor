NOBODY KNOWS ME AT ALL

When I was a child everybody smiled, nobody knows me at all
Very late at night and in the morning light, nobody knows me at all

Now I got lots of friends, yes, but then again, nobody knows me at all 
Kids and a wife, it’s a beautiful life, nobody knows me at all

And oh when the lights are low
Oh with someone I don’t know

I don’t give a damn, I’m happy as a clam, nobody knows me at all 
Ah, what can you do? There’s nobody like you. Nobody knows me at all

I know how you feel, no secrets to reveal, nobody knows me at all
Very late at night and in the morning light, nobody knows me at all
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me, nobody knows me at all
