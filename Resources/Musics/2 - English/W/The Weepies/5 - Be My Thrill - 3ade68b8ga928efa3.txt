BE MY THRILL

Be my thrill, my little white pill, 
My unpaid bill, the one who will 
Be my love, my little grey dove, 
My push and my shove, my heaven above

And we tumble down like Jack and Jill, 
And I miss all of the joy you kill
But I love you still, be my thrill

Be my one, my day in the sun, my little pop gun,
The best thing I've done 
Be my what, my open and shut, 
My everything but, my little hot slut

And every morning is like the one before
And everybody needs someone to adore
I'm counting on you
Oh baby say you will
Oh baby be my thrill

Be my youth, my kissing booth, my little sweet tooth, 
My beauty and truth
Be my thrill, my little white pill, my wait up until,
 the one who will
