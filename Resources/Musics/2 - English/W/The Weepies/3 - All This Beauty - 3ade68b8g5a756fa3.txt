ALL THIS BEAUTY

All this beauty 
You might have 
To close your eyes
And slowly open wide
All this beauty
We traveled all night
We drank the ocean dry
And watched the sunrise

You can ask about it
But nobody knows the way
No bread-crumb trail
To follow 
Through your days
It takes 
An axe sometimes
A feather 
In the sunshine
And bad weather
It's a matter 
Of getting deeper in
Anyway you can

All this beauty
You might have 
To close your eyes
And slowly open wide
All this beauty
We traveled all night
We drank the ocean dry
And watched the sunrise

I can see 
You're new, awake
Let me assure you 
Friend
Every day is ice cream 
And chocolate cake
And what you make of it
Let me just say
You get what you take
From it, so be amazed
Whenever you stop
You gotta be brave

All this beauty
You might have 
To close your eyes
And slowly open wide 
(All this beauty)
And watch the sunrise
