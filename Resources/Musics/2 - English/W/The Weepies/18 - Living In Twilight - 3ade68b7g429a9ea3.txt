LIVING IN TWILIGHT

You look darkly on the day
With memories to light your way
A little sad but it's all right
We are always living in twilight

No one knocks upon your door 
Until you don't care anymore
A little alone but it's all right
We are always living in twilight 

Living in a dream, walking in between the sunrise and sunset
Living in a dream, walking in between sunset and sunrise

You get tied up in your day, so I let go and walk away
And now we're loose ends of the night
We are always living in twilight

Living in a dream, walking in between the sunrise and sunset
Living in a dream, walking in between sunset and sunrise

So it goes, though no one knows you like they used to do 
Have a drink the sky is sinking toward a deeper blue
And you're still all right
Step out into twilight

So I stumble home at night 
Like I've stumbled through my life
With ghosts and visions in my sight
We are always living in twilight
