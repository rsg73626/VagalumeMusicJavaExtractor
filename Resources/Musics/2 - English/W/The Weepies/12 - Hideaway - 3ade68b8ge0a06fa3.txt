HIDEAWAY

Take the sky
For example
A canvas of a billion suns
But our local hero
Shines them out by day
Safe for the winking of a Venus or Mars

Even the stars
Sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars
Hideaway

I see the bare moon
Raise it's big bald head
I see my friends play the fool
I'll make my own way
In the wide world
Just know I don't want to wander too far

Even the stars
Sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars
Hideaway

Even the stars
Sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars
Hideaway

It's so calming
All kinds of names
Some say I don't the play the right kind of game
I try to be honest
I try to be kind
And honestly leave when I know that it's time
I know that it's time

Hear a phoebe sing his only song
The summer's day is hovering
I'll write my full heart
Troubles while I can burst
Out the windows of our traveling car

Even the stars
Sometimes fade to gray
Even the stars
Hideaway
