SUICIDE BLONDE

You know the way you look makes everyone hungry
You got the ways and means to make it all right
Dye your hair suicide blonde
Dye your hair suicide blonde 

Lose your identity, wander in any direction
Yeah, that’s the road to heaven’s door
Dye your hair suicide blonde
Dye your hair suicide blonde 

Been so long since you’re gone 
Yeah, you turn me on 

You know the way you look makes everyone hungry 
Are you a key to heaven’s door? 
Dye your hair suicide blonde
Dye your hair suicide blonde
