WORLD SPINS MADLY ON

Woke up and wished that I was dead
With an aching in my head 
I lay motionless in bed
I thought of you and where you’d gone
and let the world spin madly on

Everything that I said I’d do 
Like make the world brand new
And take the time for you
I just got lost and slept right through the dawn 
And the world spins madly on

I let the day go by 
I always say goodbye
I watch the stars from my window sill 
The whole world is moving and I’m standing still

Woke up and wished that I was dead 
With an aching in my head 
I lay motionless in bed
The night is here and the day is gone
And the world spins madly on

I thought of you and where you’d gone 
And the world spins madly on.
