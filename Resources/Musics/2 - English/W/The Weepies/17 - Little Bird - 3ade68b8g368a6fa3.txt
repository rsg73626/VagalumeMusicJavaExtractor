LITTLE BIRD

Sometimes it's hard to say 
Even one thing true
When all eyes have turned aside
They used to talk to you
And people on the street 
Seem to disapprove
So you keep moving away
And forget what you wanted to say

Little bird, little bird
Brush your gray wings on my head
Say what you said, say it again
They tell me I'm crazy
But you told me I'm golden

Sometimes it's hard 
To tell the truth from a lie
Nobody knows 
What's in the hold of your mind
We are all buildings and people inside
Never know who'll walk through the door
Is it someone that you've met before?

Little bird, little bird
Brush your gray wings on my head
Say what you said, say it again
They tell me I'm crazy
But you told me I'm golden

I know what I know
A wind in the trees
And a road 
That goes winding under
From here I see rain 
I hear thunder
Somewhere there's sun 
And you don't need a reason

Sometimes it's hard 
To find a way to keep on
Quiet weekends 
Holidays, you come undone
Open your window and look upon
All the kinds of alive you can be
Be still, be light, believe me

Little bird, little bird
Brush your gray wings on my head
Say what you said, say it again
They tell me I'm crazy
But you told me I'm golden
I'm golden
