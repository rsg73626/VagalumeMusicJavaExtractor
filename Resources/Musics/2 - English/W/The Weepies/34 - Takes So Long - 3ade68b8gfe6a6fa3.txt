TAKES SO LONG

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why it takes so long

I cut my hair, I grow it back
First the thought and then the act
To think a plant up towards the sun
It can't be done, it can't be done

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why it takes so long

I see you now, I saw you then
I know you more, and different
I can't contain it, still complain
Love's a weed, trust is rain

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why it takes so long
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why it takes so long

In a moment wings unfurl
A butterfly, a little girl
Star pieces fall to the ground
Streaks of light, just tonight

Sam and Libby, Lib and Sam
Made a little one of them
A baby's born a man to die
I don't know why, I don't know why

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why it takes so long
It takes so long
It takes so long
It takes so long
