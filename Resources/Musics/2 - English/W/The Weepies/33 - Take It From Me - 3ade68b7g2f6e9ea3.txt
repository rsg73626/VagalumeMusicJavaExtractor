TAKE IT FROM ME

What can I compare you to, a favorite pair of shoes? 
Maybe my bright red boots if they had wings
Funny how we animate colorful objects saved
Funny how it’s hard to take a love with no sting.

But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me 
But come on take it, come on take it, take it from me (we`ve got a good life).

What can I compare you to, a window the sun shines through? 
Maybe the silver moon, a smile rising
The magic of the fading day, satellites on parade
A toast to the plans we've made to live like kings.

I lose my breath despite the air
When the rain falls down I give in to despair
Pink magnolia in winter she doesn’t care 
if you don’t show up to have another cup.

What can I compare you to, when everything looks like you? 
I get a bit confused with every Spring
Flowers that bloom your eyes, hummingbirds side by side
My heart won’t stay entirely in this rib caging
