PAINTING BY CHAGALL

Thunder rumbles in the distance, a quiet intensity
I am willful, your insistence is tugging at the best of me 
You’re the moon, I’m the water
You’re Mars, calling up Neptune’s daughter 

Sometimes rain that’s needed falls 
We float like two lovers in a painting by Chagall
All around is sky and blue town 
Holding these flowers for a wedding gown
We live so high above the ground, satellites surround us. 

I am humbled in this city
There seems to be an endless sea of people like us
Wakeful dreamers, I pass them on the sunlit streets 
In our rooms filled with laughter
We make hope from every small disaster

Everybody says “you can’t, you can't, you can't, don’t try.” 
Still everybody says that if they had the chance they’d fly like we do.
