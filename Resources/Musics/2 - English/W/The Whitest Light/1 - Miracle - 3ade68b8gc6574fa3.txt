MIRACLE

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

to love and lose is better than left out, just like
baseball everyone strikes out, well I don't know why
you would try and lie to me again, when I've been
through this a thousand times and now, I'm not let
it end

only a miracle could save you now
but i'm not sure that miracles happen to people like
you
and only a miracle can make me see the things you do
and miracles really do come true
'cause now i believe in you

every once in a while one of us finds out
just what it feels like when it all works out
but I don't know why you would try and lie to me
again
when i've been through this a thousand times again
and now i'm not giving in

only a miracle could save you now
but i'm not sure that miracles happen to people like
you
and only a miracle can make me see the things you do
and miracles really do come true
'cause now i believe in you

you don't phase me baby
you've got to go,
bombs away
well oh baby lately
...

and only a miracle could save you now
but i'm not sure that miracles happen to people like
you
and only a miracle can make me see the things you do
and miracles really do come true
'cause now i believe in you
