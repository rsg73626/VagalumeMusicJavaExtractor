CANDY FLU

Do what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do
And I live my life beside yours girl for you
I got the candy flu
I got the candy flu
Candy's sweet it takes me back to you

I try and walk away
I try and walk away
Walk so far it takes me back to you
And I'm doing lines
Oh I'm doing fine
Lines twist round my brain and I turn blue
