COMIN' THROUGH

I've been trying just to pull it through
This? ramblin' road
Spent some time in a common place
In everyone
Who'd been burned like a thousand times
Just wastin' away
They'd arranged for the bitter man
To take them away

Fell in line with the racketeers
From head to toe
Fell in line with the racketeers
From layin' low
In the darkest point of night
I want you
To be here light before
Comin' through
