SUFFERING

I was here in the world
the world that you gave me every time
You can say that you? re running
cuz I can go back on the street
I'll be here when we both gonna fake it
We're awake

No more try to hear killing your goal
Means I can be bigger then the tones
In the moments of suffering
Like the feeling that you gave me
like a snowflake though the fire
I'll be frozen in time but you'll be here
Suffering

Will you be here suffering?
Will you be here suffering?
"Well I hope to be"
