UP ALL NIGHT

I don't know
I've been away
I don't believe
In the real thing

I once got started
Then it all went black
Your love's got me
Like it always has

But it just stopped raining
I'm stepping out into the world
I'm stepping out into the light, yeah

I've been through it
I always have paranoia
That I would not last

But I pinned it on you
Held it up and showed the world
Held it up into the light
Once it's right between your eyes
You'll see it's right here
Look, it's glowing
It's not some feeling I can break

There's no way
If I hold on
The shots may ring
Through a lonely hall

I've been up all night
Spinning 'round the floor
It's not some feeling I can break

I keep raising up my
I keep raising up my
It's not some feeling I can shake

There's no way
If I hold on
The shots may ring
Through a lonely hall
But the hole in my head
Emptied out into a love
Came pouring out into a life

Hold it up into the light
Once it's right between your eyes
You'll see it's right here
Look, it's glowing
It's not some feeling I can break
