DISAPPEARING

All this way to connect
And all the way to the corner everyday
You were there for me

But will you wait for the one that disappear?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I was home when you came
It threw me out of touch
It took away from the cold of your arms
Now I wait for my turn to let it blow
Against me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Will you wait for the one that disappears?
