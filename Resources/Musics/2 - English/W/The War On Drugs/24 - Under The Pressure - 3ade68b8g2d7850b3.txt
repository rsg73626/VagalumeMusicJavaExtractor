UNDER THE PRESSURE

With a comb down here, it's easy
But do you rather have a good day?
But a dream like this gets wasted
That you'll... bend under pressure

Still you'll... bend over pressure

I really love it, oh, you love it
Not gonna loose you, when it all breaks down
And the runaways standing in the wind and pray
And they stare straight into nothing

But we're all kinda the same. You all raise
On a promise, found out over time
Bet it will come around, get a new way
Or watches how it all breaks down here

Under the pressure

Never break out there
The storm and the wind will go
However you count down there
Stay, keep holding on!

In a cold wind, all arrested
Now, you know how it feels
This is really, warden in my back
Goose all in my gut, this is real

Standing in the water, just trying not to crack
Under pressure
