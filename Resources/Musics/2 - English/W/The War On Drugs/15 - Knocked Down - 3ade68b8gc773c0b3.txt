KNOCKED DOWN

Far away there is a star
Raining through the night sky like a drop
Give 'em all a piece of moon for me
Somehow I can make it rain
Diamonds in the night sky, I'm like a child
And now I'm all beaten up and weak

I wanna lie here but I get knocked down
I'm only shaking cuz I'm lying in the hold
I want to shade it but I can't break free
Anyway

Somewhere out there look at my
It's like I'm raining in the night sky like a drop
Now you're all beaten up, you're weak

Somewhere they can make it rain
Diamonds in the night sky, I'm like a child
All alone, beaten up, free

I want to love you but I get knocked down
I want to love you when I'm lying in the ground
I want to show you but I can't break free
To be the one that I should dare to be

I want to love you but I get knocked down
I want to shake you 'cuz I'm lying in the hold
I want to shake it but I can't break free
Anyway
