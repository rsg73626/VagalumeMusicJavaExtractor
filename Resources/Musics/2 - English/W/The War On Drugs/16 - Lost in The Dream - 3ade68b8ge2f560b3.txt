LOST IN THE DREAM

Lost in the dream
Or just the silence of a moment
It? s always hard to tell
Down in the way
They cut it open and they sold it
It? s always hard to tell

I saw a soldier man
He locked his eyes like they were red
Ooh but it? s hard they can? t resist
You may risk it all
You? d risk it all for the memory
But it? s living under your skin
Love? s the key to the things that we see
And don? t mind chasing
Leave the light on in the yard for me

When we were the same
We stroked our arms and we wore them thin
Ah the sadness it was in
You don? t miss it man
You got it all like a memory
Now it? s living under your skin
Love? s the key to the games that we play
But don? t mind losing
Love? s the key to the things that we see
But you don? t mind moving
It? s a door?
It? s the key to the dark?
Love? s a game; it? s always the same
Oh, all the way
