CLEAN LIVING

I waited all my life to come
Running through the field when I see you
In the end, when you're young, you follow
Shadows even though they fade
Baby, you're

In the end, there was a red light shining
Shining all your love to come
Sometimes I lay in the darkness
Just to see if I can hear the spark

But I never went away, babe
Show me how you do it
I've been looking all night
Go away and back
Show me that you want it
I'm alone in life
All this reading in no light

Once I was alone in a lonesome time
You were livin' in my place
When I took the train up to see you
Everything that I couldn't change

But I never went away, babe
Show me how you do it
I've been looking all night
Go away and back
Show me that you notice
In a long time
All this living in no life

I don't want to live to make you
Show me how you do it
I've been looking all night
I went away and back
Show me that you noticed
In a long time

I ain't giving in
I know my way around it
I've been doing all right
I don't need it back
