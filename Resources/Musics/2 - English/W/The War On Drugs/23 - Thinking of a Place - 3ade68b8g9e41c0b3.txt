THINKING OF A PLACE

It was back in Little Bend that I saw you
Light was changing on the water
Where birds above had flown
There was pain in your eyes
So you vanished in the night
Missouri River in the distance
So I lied upon the lawn

I remember walking against the darkness of the beach
Love is like a ghost in the distance, ever-reached
Travel through the night 'cause there is no fear
Alone but right behind till I watched you disappear

I'm moving through the dark
Of a long black night
Just moving with the moon
And the light it shines
And I'm thinking of a place
And it feels so very real
Just moving through the dark

Once I had a dream I was falling from the sky
Coming down like running water
Passing by myself alight
In the morning
I would wake to the sound of someone's voice
Like little whispers through the silence

I'm moving through the dark
Of a long black night
And I'm looking at the moon
And the light it shines
But I'm thinking of a place
And it feels so very real
Oh, the suffering of love

Come and take my hand, babe
There's a turn in the road that we've been taking
Let it set you free
Because there's a rhythm in the way
that we've been moving
Yeah, there's a darkness over there, but we ain't going

See it through through my eyes
Walk me to the water
Hold my hand as something turns to me
Love me every night
Drown me in the water
Hold my hand as something turning me
See it through my eyes
Love me like no other
And hold my hand as something turns to me
And turns me into you

Lead me through the night
Pull me from the water
Hold my hand as something turns to me
Turns me into you
Just see it through my eyes
Love me like no other
Hold my hand as something turns to me
Turns me into you
Turning me
Into you
