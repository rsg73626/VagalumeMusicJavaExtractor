BABY MISSILES

I'm on the back of a new belief
And on the back of a new belief
My friend rides all alone
Yeah, he's up and down like a new jack tone

He was a part of the new machine
He felt alive in the new machine
My friend dies all alone
Yeah, just up and down like a new jack tone

Yeah, you want to talk about going down
Yeah, --- make a young man proud
You should have seen all the rattling in my brain

And in the wake of a northeast
I came on my back, like a northeast per ch
You should have seen all the rattling in my way

Just the sound of a northeast--- coming back here
Because I don't mind when all the pioneers go soft on me
Its just the sound of norhteast
You got your head in the common field
Just your hands with the common touch

Whoo hooo
Yeah

I was alive on the new machine
He felt alive in the new machine
My friend rides all alone
Yeah he's up and down like a new jack tone
He wanna leave but he don't know how
He want to try but he don't know why
He's going to lean on the back of me
Like a slide on the back of ----

Whoo hooo

Ooh, just the sound of a northeast --- walking back here
Because I don't mind when all the pioneers go soft on me
Its just the sound of a northeast----
You got your head in the common field
Like just your hands with the common touch
