HOLD IT KID

Well it gets cold in here
These years they pass with fear
Your daddy don't love you anymore
The fear it comes and goes
Money goes up their nose
Your momma don't live her anymore

Just dry your cheeks girl, wipe your eyes
Just close the door it'll be alright
Your daddy's tripping from the needle in his arm

The belt it wraps so tight
The pain around your life
Your momma don't live here anymore

These tears they come at night
You live and learn to fight
Your daddy don't love you anymore

Your life it comes with pain
Money goes in their veins
Your momma don't live here anymore

It comes and goes so far
Lookin' into their arms
Your daddy don't love you anymore
