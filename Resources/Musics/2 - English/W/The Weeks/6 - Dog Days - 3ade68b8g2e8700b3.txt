DOG DAYS

Your body is shaking and my body is growing cold
You tell your stories but your stories they're so old
The sun is warm and the water is now fine
But you've been drinking up love songs 
like you've been drinking up wine
I met an old man; he sits and plays guitar
He said the music's the way to young lovers hearts

Well, I'm missing, missing, missing my summer love
I'm longing for comfort, I'm longing for your touch
And I said, 'Oh kiss me, oh kiss, oh kiss me'
And the summer it will never end

She laughed, she laughed; she picked flowers and I sang
She laughed and danced when it started to rain
I kissed, I kissed you underneath that tree
We dreamt of how beautiful our futures could be

I walked you home in the blackest of night
I held your hand, kissed your lips and said, 'Goodnight'

Well, I'm missing, missing, missing my summer love
I'm longing for comfort, I'm longing for your touch
And I said, 'Oh kiss me, oh kiss, oh kiss me'
And the summer it will never end

And I said, 'Oh kiss me, oh kiss, oh kiss me'
And the summer it will never end
