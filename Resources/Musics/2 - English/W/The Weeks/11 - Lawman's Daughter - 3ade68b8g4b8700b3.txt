LAWMAN'S DAUGHTER

Well I think times are changing momma
Break my spirit and kill my pride
She might be the lawman's daughter
But I'm gonna make that girl my bride
I said, "Son I'm sorry but that can't happen"
Our kind just don't mix with them
You might love the lawman's daughter
But your family's filled with wanted men

I said, "Oh, how bad could it be?"
For a law filled girl to love a man like me
Chasing ten car trains and whiskey dames don't mean a thing
Just as long as I got her with me

Well you know that sheriffs been looking for you
He knows y'all been robbing trains
If he sees you with his daughter
He won't stop 'til he sees you hang
Well Christian hearts don't feed no families
Guns and trains mean moneys good
Tell that sheriffs that's been looking for me
Hang me up, I wish you would

I said, "Oh, how bad could it be?"
For a law filled girl to love a man like me
Chasing ten car trains and whiskey dames don't mean a thing
Just as long as I got her with me
