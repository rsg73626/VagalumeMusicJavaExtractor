HEARD IT ALL

She's saying that she waits for me
Southern girl down in New Orleans
She been saying that she waits for me
But she don't wait for me

She said she done heard it all
Built a case but she took the fall
She been sayin' that she waits for me
But she don't wait for me

Well I can see her somewhere down in New Orleans
She's been broke and cold and I can see
She's been strung out, goddamn turn the music loud
She don't stay but she'll wait for me

She said that she stayed for free somewhere up in Tennessee
She saying that she waits for me
But she don't wait for me

She said she done seen it all
I was there but I didn't call
She's been saying that she waits for me
But she don't wait for me

Well I can see her somewhere down in New Orleans
She's been broke and cold and I can see
She's been strung out, goddamn turn the music loud
She don't stay but she'll wait for me

Wasting my time, wasting my time
Wasting my precious time
Wasting my time
Jumping state lines

She's saying that she waits for me
Southern girl down in New Orleans
She been saying that she waits for me
But she don't wait for me
