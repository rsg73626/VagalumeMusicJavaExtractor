COMEBACK CADILLAC

Airplanes and speedtrains and my god she's leavin
Actress and bad kiss with my heart I'm screamin'
Well, headaches and heartbreaks; your words were misleadin'
With short dress and cheap sex, scratchin' and bleedin'
Kisses with lipstick; your message receivin'
Knife sticks my back splits, her bedroom was heated

Well, God's bearing down on a beggar's back
These pills got me jumpin' so I can't relax
She's strung out in the backseat of someone's car
Telling me, 'Go back,' but we've gone too far
A man stopped and asked me why I felt so good
I said I met that little girlie out in Hollywood

Blonde hair your drunk stare that girl she was leavin
Cocaine, you're insane; that girl she was cheatin'
Well, caskets, her last kiss I had it was sweet
You told me you loved me but you were a-leavin'
Well, love is a virtue but love it is fleetin'
That girl she was gone and my heart stopped beatin'

Well, God's bearing down on a beggar's back
These pills got me jumpin' so I can't relax
She's strung out in the backseat of someone's car
Telling me, 'Go back,' but we've gone too far
A man stopped and asked me why I felt so good
I said I met that little girlie out in Hollywood

Well, come back Cadillac
Bring my baby back
Comeback Cadillac

I said, come back Cadillac
Bring my baby back
Comeback Cadillac

Well, God's bearing down on a beggar's back
These pills got me jumpin' so I can't relax
She's strung out in the backseat of someone's car
Telling me, 'Go back,' but we've gone too far
A man stopped and asked me why I felt so good
I said I met that little girlie out in Hollywood
