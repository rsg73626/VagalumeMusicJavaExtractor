IM NOT DEAD YET

Well she said she's leaving me said she's been cutting throats
And will find which ones are clean will see who bleeds the most
Well preacher just wipes his face ripping out bible page
Well I am the one who's whole, I am the one they'll save

Oh, I'm not dead yet
You dont K
I keep my hands clean
I'm not dead yet

Well god bless the weaker ones who search for a safer place
Well the streets they were lined with ghosts 
and they were all there for me
Well if everyone's afraid to die well I be the first to leave
Hold on to thoughts of hope and wait for them angels to sing
Well I will lie with the snakes and wait for them to come for me

Oh, I'm not dead yet
Well I keep my hands clean
I'm not dead yet
Well god only speaks to me
I'm not dead yet

If I got god then I got no problems
But I am god so I got no problems

She said I'm gone
I lost my home
So far we're fine
I don't mind dying
Dear god, please send me
This church it's empty

If I got god then I got no problems
But I am god so I got no problems
