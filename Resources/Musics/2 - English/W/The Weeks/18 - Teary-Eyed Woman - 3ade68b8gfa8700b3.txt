TEARY-EYED WOMAN

Ain't no woman gonna bring me down with those teary eyes
Ain't no woman gonna bring me down with those teary lies
And oh my god, why do I watch you cry?
And oh my god, this shits got to die

Lookin' out my window and what do I see?
This pretty young girl and she's chasing me
And oh my god, why won't you let me be?
And oh my god, why won't you let me be?

When I look at you there's one thing I despise
Lookin' at you with those teary eyes
And oh my god, you are full of lies
And oh my god, you are full of lies

Ain't no woman gonna bring me down.
