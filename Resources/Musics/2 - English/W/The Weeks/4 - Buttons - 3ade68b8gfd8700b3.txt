BUTTONS

I said darling why so blue
She told me I been missin' you
He said leave and she said stay
She kissed my lips and quickly ran away

Lost them buttons to my overcoat
Pull your knife away from my throat
She said smoke your cigarette I hope you choke
Kissed my lips and quickly ran away

I shake, I shake I could never see
How good young love could really be
I know, I know it's not that bad
Take a look at what we had

Walked you home from the park
Held your hand it was after dark
Hold me close, said she'll always stay
She kissed my lips and quickly ran away

Lost them buttons to my overcoat
Pull your knife away from my throat
She said smoke your cigarette I hope you choke
Kissed my lips and quickly ran away

I shake, I shake I could never see
How good young love could really be
I know, I know it's not that bad
Take a look at what we had
