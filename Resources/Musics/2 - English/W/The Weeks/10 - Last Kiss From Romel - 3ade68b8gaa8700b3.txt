LAST KISS FROM ROMEL

Torn shoes and his old suitcase and 
I'm tired of that look on your face
But I know he's coming home
His hearts been caving in and I think its time we leave my friend
But the hand was dealt a long, long time ago

First kiss was from Romeo
And I pray to god they keep it slow
Cause if they don't, she's going home
Her hair is turning gray and he's a million fucking miles away
But I know, she's going home

My heart broke as the coffin closed
And I pray to god they keep it slow
Cause if they don't then she's coming home

That letter came too late and I prayed to god he could relate
But he can't, so he's coming home
My heart broke as the coffin closed
And I pray to god they keep it slow
Cause if they don't then she's coming home

She's going home.
