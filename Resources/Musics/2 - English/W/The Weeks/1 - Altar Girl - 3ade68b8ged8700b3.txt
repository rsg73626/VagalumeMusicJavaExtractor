ALTAR GIRL

She was shakin' her hips
And I biting my lip
Why don't you have yourself a drink?
Well I guess that gives me just a little bit more time to think

Don't take my name, don't take my place
Little girl said she's scared to lose her faith

Don't take my name, don't take my place
Little girl said she's scared to lose her face

She had eyes that cut like a razorblade
Books and bibles read but they never save
Little girl work your hands down like a slave
She said don't take my name, don't take my place

Don't take my name, don't take my place
Little girl said she's scared to lose her faith
Don't take my name, don't take my place
Little girl said she's scared to lose her face

My little altar girl I wait for you tonight
When I sit alone you know I pray right by your side
