SAILOR SONG

Well I asked her why she cried
What she was doing with her life
She said "I could marry a sailor
I think that I'd make a good wife
But he would leave for months at sea
Leaving only the baby and me
And I do not think that I could stay faithful

And I could leave the sound for good
Bringing only some photos and a book
But I'm pretty sure my legs would grow weary"

Then she asked how bout me
I said "well darling let me see
I hear wedding bells and see kisses from lovers
Those lovers or so it seems
They appear to be you and me
But I could be wrong cause my mind's awful lazy

And now I'm seeing something else
And it's me I'm by myself
And I appear to be older and I'm awful lonely

And as I cry I ask God why
How could you let my poor wife die?"
And I told her not to cry
To wipe her eyes

(Guitar Solo)

Well if love is all you have
Well then baby that's not bad
And if love is all you got
Then that's a hell of a lot

Well if love is all you have
Well then baby that's not bad
And if love is all you got
Then that's a hell of a lot

Well if love is all you have
Well then baby that's not bad
And if love is all you got
Then that's a hell of a lot

Well if love is all you have
Well then baby that's not bad
And if love is all you got
Then that's a hell of a lot

Well if love is all you have
Well then baby that's not bad
And if love is all you got
Then that's a hell of a lot
Hell of a lot
