THE HOUSE THAT WE GREW UP IN

I said, 'Oh'
She said, 'My head aches'
But she's still dancing to the music that my band plays
I said, 'Oh'
I watch her legs shake
And she was jumping up and down just like an earthquake
I said, 'Oh'
I watch her sweat drip
I saw her clap her hands and close her eyes 
and bite her bottom lip
I said, 'Oh'
I watch her dress rip
In the car behind the club for a quick fix
And, oh
I watch her drink spill
I saw her dance right back to the bar to get a refill
I said, 'Oh'
Pick up your teeth
And all the kids they were clapping Mississippi
And, oh
We hit the mirror
And we scream a little louder so that everyone can hear; 
we said:

Oh oh, let the band play
I'm being broken up and ripped apart by X-rays
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
They can't stop us
They can't stop us
They can't stop us now

I said, 'Oh'
In the back room
On the couch, I caught a whiff of your perfume
And, oh
See the crowd rage
It was a sea of nicotine beaten teenage
And, oh
Full of heartbreak
We spent the New Year's Eve with the Champagne
And, oh
In the bathroom
Because my band was going on a little too soon
And, oh
I see stars
We spent the last few hours wastin' money in the bar
I said, 'Oh'
On the stage
Because the kids were going crazy to that Mississippi rain

Oh oh, let the band play
I'm being broken up and ripped apart by X-rays
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
They can't stop us
They can't stop us
