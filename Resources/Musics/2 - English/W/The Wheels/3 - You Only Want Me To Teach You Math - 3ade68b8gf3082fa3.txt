YOU ONLY WANT ME TO TEACH YOU MATH

Looking at your neck
Watching the soft swing of your hair
When you suddenly turn your head to me
And smiling ask me if I could go with you
For sure, I do
Anytime, anytime, anytime

But you only want me to teach you math
And I know I wouldn't get more than that
But you only want me to teach you math
To teach you math
It's so sad

Anything you say
You know I'll do it
Anything you wish
You know I'll get to you
But I want more than you are giving me
Because I am so lonely and I wanna be loved
Yeah I should be loved

But you only want me to teach you math
And I know I wouldn't get more than that
Yeah you only want me to teach you math
To teach you math

And I know I wouldn't get more than that
Because you only want me to teach you math
Yeah you only want me to teach you math
It's so sad... it's so sad... it's so...
