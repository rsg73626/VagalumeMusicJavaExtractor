COINS IN THE WISHING WELL

And I am here again complaining to myself
About desires and dreams locked up in cells
The ones that don&#146;t leave
The ones I don't know
Hidden inside myself 
In a place where I no longer dare to go

I took a walk today, went to the wishing well
As the clouds moved, sun light reflection showed it well
The coins I threw in
They are still there
And then I dived (I had to dive)
Just to feel them once again here in my hands

And I am here again complaining to myself
(About desires we throw to life and whose value we forget)
I talk about it
Because no one else does 
I talk about it
Because no one else does

My lost desires
Deep inside myself
Are like the coins left in the deepness of the wishing well
