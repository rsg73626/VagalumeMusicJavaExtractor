ON YOUR HANDS

I'm a little boy and I need to play with my toys
I need someone to take my hand
And show me there's no monster under the bed

Every night, when I go to sleep
I need you to hug me
Sing a song, until I fall asleep
Cause if you cry... you...

You got me on your hands
(You got me on your hands)

I'm a little child and I am scared of going there
If you let the door half opened and turn on the bathroom lights
I promise I won't call, I won&#146;t cry

Every night, when I go to sleep
I need you beside me
Sing a song, until I fall asleep
&#145;Cause if you smile... you...

You got me on your hands
(You got me on your hands)
