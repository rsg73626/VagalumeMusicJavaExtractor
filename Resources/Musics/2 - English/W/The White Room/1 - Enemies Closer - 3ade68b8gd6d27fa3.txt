ENEMIES CLOSER

what in the world ws i supposed to think?
how in the hell, do you expect me to
react to the news like the one that you threw
so i make these thoughts my surrogate
i'd like to know what you have achieved
spitting your lies like you learned from master P
just so you know you have the egotist disease
and you forget the first rule is
you keep your friends close
and your enemies closer

i;ll sit in silent calm and wait
for the right moment i will take

show us the way to crucify your friends
use and abuse untill you cant pretend
you'll figure out your just part of the trend
so i make these thoughts my surrogate
i'd rather fail than not succeed as me
savour the taste, you'll need your NRG
when your alon with no one left to bleed
do not forget the first rule is
you keep your friends close
and your enemies closer

so listen up i think you will agree
that you know now not to fuck with me
words i forget and letters throw away
i have made these thoughts my surrogate
this makes me laugh cause it will eat you up
a permenant record to think of
aint even bad, coz nerve has said enough
so dont forget the best rule is
you keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
