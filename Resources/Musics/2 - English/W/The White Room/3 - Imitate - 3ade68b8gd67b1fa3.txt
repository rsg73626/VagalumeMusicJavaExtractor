IMITATE

The mindless masses preach
Committed to a useless time
And yet it
Got to suck to be like you
With all that shit you
Cool, hat and car would say
Another clone is born

I
The copied man who does what others say

Imitate

You
What about you take the chance, and do things differently
Forget about what others say and create something new
Then you would inspire and they would follow you

I
The copied man who does what others say

Imitate

Nothing but total commitment breeding that
And you

Imitate
