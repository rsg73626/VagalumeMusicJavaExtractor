VICIOUS GIRL

How are you listening 
If you?re looking away 
Its not your fault but could you pay attention to me today 
Just wanna let you know 
I?m falling apart 
The problem?s I don?t know where sanity ends and where it will start 

Absurd are the words that I heard from your mouth 
As you lay down the blame for the same 
Like you always do 
Lucky I love you enough to put up with the world 
The world of this vicious girl 

How do you think that I?ve 
Gotten this far 
By biting my tongue and holding my breath until my fists have gone hard 
Just wanna let you know 
You should stop at the start 
If you continue your profanity you will leave me a scar 

Absurd are the words that I heard from your mouth 
As you lay down the blame for the same 
Like you always do 
Lucky I love you enough to put up with the world 
The world of this vicious girl 

How are you listening 
If you?re talking over me 
What happened to taking the time to listen when I am trying to speak 

Absurd are the words that I heard from your mouth 
As you lay down the blame for the same 
Like you always do 
Lucky I love you enough to put up with the world 
The world of this vicious girl 
Absurd are the words that I heard from her mouth 
As she lays down the blame for the same 
Like she always does 
Lucky I love her enough to put up with her world 
The world of this vicious girl
