FIGURE 8

I see you, you make me cry
But I need you back in my life, in my life

I see the figure 8
It
Is this our fate
I see the figure 8
It
I can not escape

Where would I be right now
If you
To live my life aloud

I see you make me cry
But I need you back in my life, in my life

I see the figure 8
Its never ending
Is this our fate
I see the figure 8
Its never ending
I can not escape

We are together and must decide
If we should take the next step
Of our design
Don
If we create now what we have said
Are we looking at now
Not what is ahead
Don

I said

I see the figure 8
Its never ending
Is this our fate
I see the figure 8
Its never ending
I can not escape
