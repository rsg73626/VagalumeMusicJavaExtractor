NEED YOU NEED YOU

Well the rights, well they dangle in my head
Never acted before on her actions, reactions were never really good
It's alright, hesitation in my brain
Things are standing still but they're standing where they should

My finger could bring death to us all, and I need you need you need you

In a taste, I'll solute boomerangs
I could throw you, but now you're returning with burning replacement figurines
And you're right
And I've never been so wrong
I'll admit that's why we are dying and fighting…
Because surviving it… isn't fun

My finger could bring death to us all, and I need you need you need you

Crashing down on me
Won't you just let me breathe?
Crashing down on me
Won't you just let me da da da da da a
