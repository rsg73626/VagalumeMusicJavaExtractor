I AM FOR REAL

Killing for salvation
He was sittin' on his throne
And he thought of ways to reach these folks
And teach 'em what we've known
In the receiver came a voice unlike his kind
They're not speakin' the same language
But there's common ground, he'll find

I don't need to kill anyone
To let 'em know I am for real
I don't need to walk in your backyard
To let you know just where I stand

Pickin' up our pieces for the safety of our sons
He's not reaching for agreements
But he's reaching for our guns
He don't need to question
He don't need to compromise
There's no use in conversation
If there's nothing left to find

I respect your home and what you say
When you're speaking to me
And when its time to look you in the eye
You'll know where I'm coming from
Do you know where I'm coming from?

I don't need to kill anyone
I don't need to kill anyone
I don't need to kill anyone
To let 'em know I am for real
