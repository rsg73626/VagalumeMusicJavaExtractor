KILL ME CAROLYNE

Just leave my memory away*
And try, I'll try to make my case
And you give me authority

You give me authority
You give me authority to lie
Kill, kill me carolyne

I know you love me
But you'd feel better
If you just suck it up and
Kill, kill me carolyne

You know its nothing
Sentimantal
But I really really need you to
Taste, taste the bitter pill

And hurt, hurt the way it feels
Cause you give me eternity
You give me eternity
You give me eternity to die

Kill, kill me carolyne
Cause I'm not worthy
Of your affection
But now I'm begging you to

You know its nothing
Sentimental
But I really really need you to

Cause you give me authority
Cause you give me authority
Cause you give me authority
To lie

Kill, kill me carolyne
I know you love me
But you'd feel better
If you just suck it up and

Kill, kill me carolyne
Cause I'm not worthy
Of your affection
Ka ka ka ka ka ka ka

Kill, kill me carolyne
Kill, kill me carolyne
You know its nothing
Sentimental
But I really really need you to
