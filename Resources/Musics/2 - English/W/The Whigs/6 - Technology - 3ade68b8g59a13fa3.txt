Well i watched on cbs as rudy made it, it's now on
T.v. debut. and through all the big commotions it
Was clear that she was missing me too. and i try,
And i try, and i try, and i try, cause it would.
And i scream, and i scream, and i scream, and i
Scream, cause it would.

Stuck in the thought, that she was ready to go.
She said "i miss you for an instant but that
Instant is old." and she said. "technology, it
Needs me." i'm screaming, i'm mad, i gotta daily ?
She said "i..i just dont feel like myself." and
She said. "technology it needs me."

We're sinking like sand. we were tailors to the
House of your dream. on the surface she was sure
Its still regardless shes the homecoming queen.

And i try, and i try, and i try, and i try, cause
It would. and i scream, and i scream, and i
Scream, and i scream, cause it would.

Stuck in the thought, that she was ready to go.
She said "i miss you for an instant but that
Instant is old." and she said. "technology, it
Needs me." well if you want me then i'd tell ya,
"too bad." cause i..i gotta be by myself. and she
Said. "i'm all your fault i'm leavin."

And i try, and i try, and i try, and i try, cause
It would. and i scream, and i scream, and i
Scream, and i scream, cause it would.

Stuck in the thought, that she was ready to go.
She said "i miss you for an instant but that
Instant is old." and she said. "technology, it
Needs me." well if you want me then i'd tell ya,
