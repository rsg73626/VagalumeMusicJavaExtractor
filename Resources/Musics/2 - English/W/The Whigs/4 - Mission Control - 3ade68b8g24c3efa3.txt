MISSION CONTROL

Mission control, take his feet, he's tired of where they lead him
Twinkling lights in his eyes, he's racing up to meet them
Mission control, mission control

So I'll erase them now, all of the people I know and love
I will erase you now, all of the people I know and love

Baby on mars, she's alone, her home blushes beneath her
She sees me wave, and she smiles, she knows I comprehend her

So I'd erase you now, all of the people I know and love
Say, I would erase you now, all of the people I know and love
Are gone….gone now
Mission control…
Remind me, take me, bring me back down to my knees, mission control, ohhhhhhh
