I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THE ONE I LOVE

Josie, sleep with me tonight
Yeah, I know it's wrong
Yeah, I know it's wrong
This motivates me the most

And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
Uou take me by the hand
And lead me to the door

Temptation in my blood delivers
I don't even care about the one I love
And theres a black heart inside of me
I don't even care about the one I love

And theres a black heart inside of me
Missy believe me this once
That I don't love you
That I don't love you

These accusations are false
And you can't make them
Yeah you can't make them
Uou take me to the mirror

The reptile that you see
Is stuck inside its skin forever
I don't even care about the one I love

And theres a black heart inside of me
I don't even care about the one I love
And theres a black heart inside of me
