FOR EVERY PASSING MOMENT

Another day has come and gone
And it seemed to happen all too fast
I turned around and you had gone
And left us in another bind

I wish you could see a minute, maybe two
Through my eyes, the way I see you
But you don't care and I don't mind
'Cause it happens every time

Another day has come and gone
Nothing ever seems to last
I turned around and you had gone
And left me standing here again
