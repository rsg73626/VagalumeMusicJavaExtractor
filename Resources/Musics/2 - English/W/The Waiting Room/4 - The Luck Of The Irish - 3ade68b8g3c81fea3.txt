THE LUCK OF THE IRISH

Some say we're soldiers without a war
But righteousness is a word that's worth my fighting for
Bullets of faith from the barrel of truth
Could kill the lion like a razorblade noose

Running (for mayor of a ghost town)
Free as the felon in cell 345
I know (the war that has begun now)
And taken my best has been done to death

A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye
You owe me your jaw and whats left of your sight
Your jagged medicine like slow flowing lies pours down my throat

Running (for mayor of a ghost town)
Free as the felon in cell 345
I know (the war that has begun now)
And taken my best has been done to death

Sooner or later white flags will be waving
And I hope mine is down at my side
With the colors of conquest 
I'd be proud as a poacher but im weak with a trigger
