ALL YOU DIDN'T SAY

Passing cold December nites with you
And all the things you've left unsaid
I still know everything you mean
And still softly I plead
Anywhere but here
Anytime but now
Can't we make it through tonite
And then pray for tomorrow

You can't see what this is to me
When it's covered by your memory
Put it aside but don't leave me behind
I'm calling out to you

Worthless time was spent tonite
Speaking of things unheard of
We never hear the other for the last time
Although simple to you I cannot see
Forget these faults, just come back to me
