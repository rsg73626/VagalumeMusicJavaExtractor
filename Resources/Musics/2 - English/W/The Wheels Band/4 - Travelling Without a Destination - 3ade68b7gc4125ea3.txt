TRAVELLING WITHOUT A DESTINATION

Travelling Without Destination
JJ

(chorus)
I will go 
Where I don't know
I will ride 
Into the road
I will sail 
Onto the sea
I have to find 
What I need

And if you want
You can come
And if you want
You can come to my world

I'll travel without a destination
I won't stop 
'Till I reach it
And I will know 
If I've found it

(chorus)

Nothing can pull me out of my dream
Nothing can see as far as I've seen
Nothing can sing as loud as I sing
And nothing, nothing can change my mind.

(chorus)

And if you want
You can come
And if you want
You can come
