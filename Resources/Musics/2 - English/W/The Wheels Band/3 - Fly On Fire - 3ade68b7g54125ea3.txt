FLY ON FIRE

Fly On Fire
JJ

I dream about myself
There's cotton on my nose
I am on fire inside

You dream about yourself
There's cotton on your nose
You are on fire inside

I can't say it
It's too deep inside
I'd rather leave it like that
Before I explode

(chorus)
I am on fire
I am burning
I am in the shadows of my mind

I fall on a chair
There're things to eat
But they discust me even more

You fall on a chair
There're things to eat
But they discust you even more

(chorus)

I think about the world
There's so much to think
I don't need to sleep

You think about the door
You can't go in
Will the treasure be a sin?

Fly on Fire
Fly on Fire
Fly on Fire
Fly on Fire
Fly on Fire
Fly on Fire
