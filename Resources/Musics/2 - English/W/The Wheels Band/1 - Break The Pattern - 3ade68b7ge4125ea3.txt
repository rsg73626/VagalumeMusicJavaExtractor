Break the pattern
Yeah, break the pattern
Yeah, crack the pattern
Yeah, break it right now

We're labeled by some rules
We don't have a(Ãªi) will
We cannot even feel it
Our reality ain't real
Now we have laws to kill
And new rules to make

So much to fake
So much to take
So much false sake
So much it's too late

Break the pattern
Yeah, break the pattern
Yeah, make the pattern
Yeah, break it right now

It's too hard to sleep
Callings and fate in my dreams
Telling me to make some changes
For a new world begin

We can't change it (5x)

Break the pattern
Yeah, break the pattern
Yeah, rape the pattern
Yeah, break it right now

We can't change it
So much to fake and
We can't change it
So much to take and
We can't change it
So much it's too late
So much it's too late

Break the pattern
Yeah, break the pattern
Yeah, crush the pattern
Yeah, break it right now
