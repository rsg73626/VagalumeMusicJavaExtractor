DARKHORSE

Darkhorse
JJ

Run when you have some time to spend
Darkhorse he will die again
He doesn't live while he can love
He never has been above

(chorus)
Darkhorse has no past
His future is refused at last
A sign has taken him back
To heaven or nirvana instead

In the mountais he is really free
When the sun comes happy he'll be
He rides when the sun is out
And he'll never talk about it

(chorus)

Run when you have some time to spend
Darkhorse he will die again
He doesn't live while he can love
He never has been above


(chorus)
