I WANT YOU BACK

Oh Yeah
Let me tell you now
Oooh, oooh baby
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always
Make you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One look was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
And, oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Trying to live without your love
Is just one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
And every street you walk on
I'll be kissing the ground
Following a girl
I didn't even want around

Oh, baby
Oh, darling
Won't you give me
Just one more
Just one more
