WONDERSTUFF

It's a wonder I can walk on painted avenues
It's a wonder I can walk with holes all in my shoes
When I was born they said my legs were ten feet tall
It's a wonder I can walk at all

It's a wonder I can sleep in a house that's up for sale
It's a wonder I can sleep on a rusty bed of nails
My head lay on the pillow
My feet lay in the hall
It's a wonder I can sleep at all

High winds blow, deep waters flow
I get caught up with the distant thunder
I get so weak with wonder
Very soon I will be under a river flow of rain

It's a wonder I can think with my head all full of smoke
It's a wonder I can think and a wonder you don't choke

Thinking on my feet, you know, it's a wonder I don't fall
It's a wonder I can think at all
