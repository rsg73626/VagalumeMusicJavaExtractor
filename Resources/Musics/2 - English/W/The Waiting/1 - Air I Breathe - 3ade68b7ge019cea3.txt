AIR I BREATHE

Take me back to the mountain, across the midnight sea
I want to sit at Your feet
Take me back to the river that runs through burning sand
I want to go hand in hand
I danced a wicked notion and it echos in the back of my mind (x2)
I danced all day with the wife of the very jealous kind
I danced all night with a harlot who had no sense of time
I danced till dawn along the back roads, under a dark, threatening sky

So take me back to the mountain, across the midnight sea
I want to sit at Your feet
Take me back to the river that runs through burning sand
I want to go hand in hand
I'll cover my face
I'll fall on my knees
'Cause I need Your love like I need the air I breathe

I walked out into the open felt the rain falling on my face
I left the golden mansion for a dark, dirty place
I gave my cross of silver for something new to taste
I felt the rain fall even harder just like bullets of disgrace

I need Your love that ripples through my soul
I need Your love that gives life to my own
I need Your love that keeps no record of wrong
No record of wrongs
