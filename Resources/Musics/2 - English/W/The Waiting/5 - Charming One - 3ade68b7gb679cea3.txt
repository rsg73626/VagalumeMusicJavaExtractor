CHARMING ONE

The sweat is falling from my brow
Under the heavy heat of day
Survey the situation now
Dream of a garden far away
(Where) I saw you red and ripe and wrong
So snug and deadly in that tree
Your sweet attraction was so strong
The taste of death delicious to me
When I listened to a tempter
Who seemed colorful and wise
I was driven from perfection
And now I realize
I should have left you there to glisten in the sun
You were a charming one

There you were coming up the street
The very image of desire
You whispered sinister and sweet
A voice of innocence and fire
So I followed the deceiver
Too blind to discern
But deception was a teacher
And a brutal way to learn
That I should have turned myself around and run
You were a charming one

I saw You shamed upon a cross
Wounded and naked on that tree
You counted everything a loss
Gave every bit of it to me
So when all the other suitors come
So cleverly disguised
They'll find me clinging to Your arm
And gazing in the eyes
That holds a passion that can never be undone
You are the charming One
