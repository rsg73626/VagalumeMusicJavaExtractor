BIG PARADE

I found out
There's nothing better than a Big Parade
There's people there of each and every shade
And everyone's wearing a smile

And I found out
There's nothing sweeter than a gig like that
I'll ride a horse, and wear a big white hat
And I will be wearing a smile

Once in a while I think I'd like to get away
Leave this crowd, if only for a day
Kneel on the hill and watch the big balloons go by
And you can be there when I cry

I found out
There's nothing finer than a holy day
We'll act as if it's the only day
If only for a while

And I found out
That I love being in the Big Parade
'Cause every now and then you find some shade
And everyone's wearing a smile

I tip my hat and smile and wink and wave
Have we been here all day?

But I found out there's nothing better than the Big Parade
There's people there of each and every shade
And everyone's wearing a smile

And I found out
That I love being in the Big Parade
Because every now and then you find some shade
And everyone's wearing a smile
(Won't you smile for me?)
