MERCY SEAT

I know that I fell victim to my wicked eye
I know that I've been chasing every little lie
I'm hungry as a prisoner, I'm tired as a slave
For keeping one foot in the garden,
And one foot in the grave

But the sweetest place I know
Lies just behind the veil
There I find that you cover every time I fail
And there I see the proof that You're merciful to man
For if You were to keep a record I know I could never stand.
Instead you lead me to a place where there's healing in your hand
There at Your...

Mercy Seat
Oh, I love Your Mercy Seat
For there you cover
Every lie I spoke and every promise that I broke
And every dreamer that I woke

I see that I have hidden every thought of You
I know my crimes are many, and my sacrifices few
And still You hold a place where atonement can be made
Where blood falls from Your finger and the debtor's debt is paid.
The broken man is mended and the lowly man is saved.
There at Your...

There just behind the veil, the sweetest work gets done
And each and every time I fail, You cover every one
I can't go over, You know I can't go under
You tear the veil away and lead me to the wonder of Your...
