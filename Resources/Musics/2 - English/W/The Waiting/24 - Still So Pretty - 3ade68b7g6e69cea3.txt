STILL SO PRETTY

Fort Myers up to Philly
Boston to Eugene
Atlanta to the city by the bay
From Nashville to Vasalia
Asheville, Abilene
Springfield, Rapid City, Monterey

From West Palm up to Wheeling
Lynchburg to L.A.
Yucaipa, Vegas, Memphis, Tupelo
Lancaster and Lakeland
Chicago and Green Bay
I feel the same way everywhere I go

That you are still so pretty to me
You're still so pretty to me
God's grace litters your land
From sea to shining sea
You're still so pretty to me

Cincy and Seattle
Toledo and New York
With Saints Joseph, Louis, Augustine and Paul
Every sweet word said in Spokane
Duluth and Davenport
Each reminds me of the beauty of it all

Yeah, you are still so pretty to me
You're still so pretty to me
God's love litters your land
From sea to shining sea
Yeah, you are still so pretty to me

The P.C.H. is quite a drive
Hit 90 doing just 45
The Badlands are good
I must confess
Drive straight to T-E-X-A-S
Denver, Tulsa, West Monroe
Albuquerque, New Mexico
Del Moines and Dayton, Kansas City
I'm restating you're still so pretty, yeah
