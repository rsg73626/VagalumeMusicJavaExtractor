SPEAK

The closer I get to where You are there 
The clearer I see Your fingerprints are everywhere 
This must be a moment between bliss and dark despair 
The louder I hear You calling my name 
The more I remember I won't be the same 
I'd run to the bushes but my feet are torn and lame from 

Too many miles straying from Your side 
Failing to fit in Your shoes 
Too many miles trying to run and hide 
When there was so much to lose 
Break my leg if You must 
But keep me close to You 

The more I can feel Your hand upon me 
The less I remember who it was I used to be 
I look back at my footprints and clearly I can see 

Not to put a strain on a stiff neck 
By looking behind me 
I've held these memories too long 
Before I put them away 
Let them remind me where I belong
