BEAUTIFUL BLOOD

Breaking the coals
Makes the fire burn bright
Doesn't seem right
Doesn't seem right 
Plowing the row
Makes it outshine the field
Doesn't seem real
Doesn't seem real
But of all the things
That don't make sense to me
There is yet a greater mystery
The river of Peace
That flowed on the wood
The beautiful blood
The beautiful blood
Meek is the lion
and brave is the lamb
Don't understand
Don't understand
The death of the One
To bring life to the rest
Who would have guessed?
Who would have guessed?
But everything's clear
Next to the mystery
Of almighty God nailed to a tree
To carry a debt
That I never could
The beautiful blood
The beautiful blood
Yes, everything's plain
Next to the mystery
Of almighty God nailed to a tree
Taking His place
Where I should have stood
The beautiful blood
The beautiful blood
