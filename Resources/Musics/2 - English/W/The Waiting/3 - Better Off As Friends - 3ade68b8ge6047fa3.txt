BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS

Please excuse my religion
Excuse the ceremony and the show
When I first gave in to Your advances
You were wanting to get closer than I'd know
But I'll allow if for a moment
For just a moment I'll come near
Long enough to say those words
That all men are taught to fear 
I think we'd be better off as friends
I think that should be where it ends
There's no complicated reason
Just as simple as sin
I think we'd be better off as friends
Please excuse my reluctance
Turn Your eyes away from my embarrassed grin
Never gone this far before
Don't think I could ever go this way again
So I'll just raise my head
And look deep into Your eyes
And offer You those words
I've been conditioned to despise
I wanted flowers
You were buying me a ring
I wanted candy
You were giving everything
You took my breath away
Don't think that I have denied it
But this heart You've stolen, Sir
Do You think we could still divide it?
