HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

Maybe I could understand
How you called the darkness light
Maybe I could understand
How you made the waters flee
Maybe I could understand
How you gave all creation life
I'm an educated man
It's not too hard for me to see
But there's something about you
That confuses me yet
First you forgive
Then you forget

How do Lord?
Oh do, Lord, tell me
How do you do that?
How do you do that?

It's not too hard for me to see
How you stilled the raging water
Not too hard for me to see 
How you walked on it like the land
It's not too hard for me to see
How you woke the sleeping daughter
I'm holding my degree
Think maybe I could understand
And I've known your forgiveness
For each and all of my days
But the way you've forgotten
Leaves me truly amazed

You know the hairs on my head
Yeah, you've named every star
But I'm bowing on my knee
At how forgetful you are

You forgive, you forget
