NOBODY'S LOVE

There's a traveler in the desert with suitcase in his hands
He's talking with a pirate who has a red list of demands
And if I can I'll meet him on the sunny southern sands
I've traveled across the land from shore to shore
I'm nobody's love but Yours

There's an earthquake in the basement and a hurricane outside
And they say it's from the blizzard that the weaker ones all died
While flood water left its marks, now we're approaching high tide
I don't think that we can take too much more
I'm nobody's love but Yours

I belong to You, I belong to You
Wrap me up in what is good and pure and true
I belong to You

Falling fast and guilty to the core
From pages past grace and mercy pour
I'm nobody's love but Yours
