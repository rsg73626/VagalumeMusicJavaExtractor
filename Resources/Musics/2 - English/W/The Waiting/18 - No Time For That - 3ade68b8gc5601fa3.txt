NO TIME FOR THAT

From the whisper of the lover to the lion's roar 
The command of the commander upon the field of war 
The instruction of the father, the laughter of the friend 
I've heard every utterance and I can't comprehend 
Just why I can't decide, I can't make the choice 
Is it Your word that I'm in love with 
Or the sound of Your voice? 

Oh speak, speak to me 
Oh speak, speak to me 
I'm as quiet as I can be 
So speak, speak to me 

From the Spirit on the water to the splitting of the sea 
The beauty of Your form upon a raging Galilee 
The cloud that filled the temple, the fire on desert sand 
I've seen every step and still don't understand 
Why I can't render a decision, I can't seem to choose 
Is it Your journey I'm in love with 
Or just the way You move? 

I love the way You speak 
In what You say and what You do 
Give me ears so I can hear You 
I need to hear You 

From the burning of the bush that refused to be consumed 
To the Spirit on a shepherd boy that ran through every tune 
The terror of the King who carries vengeance in His hand 
The love of the Messiah dying quiet as a lamb
