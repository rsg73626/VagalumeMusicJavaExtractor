IS THIS THE DAY?

Is this the day when You will do a work in me?
Is this the day when Your face is all that I can see?
Is this the day when the old in me will die?
Is this the day when You'll be glorified?

Is this the day when I will listen to Your voice alone?
Is this the day when every word I say is not my own?
Is this the day when I will run from every lie?
Is this the day when You'll be glorified?

Is this the day when You will have the victory?
Is this the day when there'll be all of You and none of me?
Is this the day when every spot in me shines white?
Is this the day when You'll be glorified?
Is this the day, Lord, when You'll be glorified?
