IT IS ENOUGH

There's something about the sorrow showing on your face
Something so tender and contrite
I know you're tired of being in this place
Your every daydream turns to night
And you've worked and strived and struggled
Until your fingers they've turned blue
From digging deep into the heart
Of what you can and cannot do 
There's something about the hesitation in your step
Something so beautiful and scared
There's something hard about the truth that you accept
And still you find a Savior there
So don't you despise the road
Should it drive straight to the Son
He's got His reason to receive you
And doesn't need another one
The Blood, it is enough
For every man, woman and child
To be reconciled
The Blood, it is enough
For those of every shade of skin
To begin again
There's something about the way you cry yourself to sleep
Something so destitute and poor
Sweet is every tear that's running down your cheek
How each one clears the way for more
So if it drives you to the Savior
Then don't disconnect the pain
He's got one excuse to hold you
And never let you go again
Everybody has tarried
In a barren land
Even in a devil's den
But if the cross that you carry
Should slip from your hands
Get on your knees
And pick it up, pick it up, pick it up again
