INDIAN SUMMER

When the sun is just behind the trees
You can see that it's a new day
When the sun is breaking through the trees
You can put your mind at ease
Put your mind at ease
The sun is shining 
When the fields are growing heavier with grain
You can harvest for the winter
When the fields are growing heavier with grain
You can put your mind at ease
Put your mind at ease
The fields are turning
Put your mind at ease
The fields are turning
One summer night, I would long to have You near me
All other nights, I would wait forever
One summer night, will I recognize Your form
On a hill far away?
When the sun lies lowly in the west
You can feel the embers glowing
When the sun leaves us for the season
You can put your mind at ease
Put your mind at ease
The embers glowing
Put your mind at ease
The embers glowing
One summer night, I would long to have You near me
All other nights, I would wait forever
One summer night, will I recognize Your form
On a hill far away and coming...
When you hold the bread in your hands
You can stay as long as you want
Hold the bread in your hands
You can put your mind at ease
Put your mind at ease
One summer night, I would long to have You near me
All other nights, I would wait forever
One summer night, will I recognize Your form
On a hill far away and coming home?
