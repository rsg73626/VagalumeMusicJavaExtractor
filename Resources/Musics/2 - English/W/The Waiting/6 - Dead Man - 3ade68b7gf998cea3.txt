DEAD MAN

Whisper my name or woo my eyes
Say your sweet little lies
Lay me down, convince me that I can't stand
Wasting time, you're talking to a dead man

Scream in my ear to stir my sleep
Say I'm feeble, say I'm weak
Tear me apart or trip me where I stand
Wasting time, you're talking to a dead man

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!

Well, my ears are closed, my eyes are shut, I
Can't see your beauty, can't hear your lying
'Cause I'm too busy dying
"Wake up," you whisper
"Wake up," you say
"Wake up," you tell me
"Wake up," you scream
Hey! Hey, Hey, Hey!

Oh you're wasting time just talking to a dead man
Yeah, you waste your time you're talking to a dead man
Oh, you're wasting time just talking to a dead man.
