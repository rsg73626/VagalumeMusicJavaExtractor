BRING BACK THE LOVE

Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Never seem to need it anyway
Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Cause it might come in handy one day

What a pleasant surprise dear, to see you
I am fine, and you’re lookin ‘ good
Hope I don’t take too much of your time dear
But there’s something I’d like to ask of you

Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Never seem to need it anyway
Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Cause it might come in handy one day

Maybe someday I’ll find me another
Someone true, who won’t let me down
Then I may wanna give her my love, dear
So, the next time that you’re back in town

Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Never seem to need it anyway
Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Cause it might come in handy one day

Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Never seem to need it anyway
Won’t you bring back the love I once gave you
Cause it might come in handy one day
