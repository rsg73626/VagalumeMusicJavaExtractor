FEBRUARY'S GONE

february's gone, 
the one thing I hope 
is the sun come and soak us with it's beams 
february's gone, 
a difficult one aquarian born reading a magazine. 

don't talk about it, just get it done 
don't talk about it, now february's gone. 

february's gone, one eye is blinking 
one eye is thinking in the sun 
february's gone, one eye is scheming 
one eye is dreaming he's the one. 

don't talk about it, don't feel that way 
don't talk about it, just leave today. 

february's gone the sleepy awaken 
the icicles breaking now it's dawn 
february's gone, you got no excuse 
just let yourself loose, the time has come. 

don't talk about it, don't feel that way 
don't talk about it, just leave today. 
don't talk, just walk, just get it done 
don't talk about it, now february's gone.
