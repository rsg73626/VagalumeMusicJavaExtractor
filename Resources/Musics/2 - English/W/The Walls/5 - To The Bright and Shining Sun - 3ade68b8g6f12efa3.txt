TO THE BRIGHT AND SHINING SUN

Slipping, slip away in space
Drifting, a smile upon his face
There’s no turning back what’s done is done
He’s heading for the bright and shining sun

People, on the other side
The people, who passed right through your life
Their faces seem to fade away somehow
So when I roll the cameras, come and take a bow
It’s so strange when life extinguishes it’s flame

[chorus]
So I run, and I run, to the bright and shining sun
Yes I run and I run to the bright and shining sun

Walking, through the barrio
Stopping for, another carajillo
She covers me in warm and gentle rays
Holds me through the night and lights the day
In this place I could escape and change my ways

So I run, and I run, to the bright and shining sun
Yes I run and I run, to the bright and shining sun
I won’t let the days melt into a haze,
I want to feel my heart I want to be amazed
So I run and I run to the bright and shining sun
