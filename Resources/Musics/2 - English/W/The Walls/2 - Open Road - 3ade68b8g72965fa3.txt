OPEN ROAD

Let us find an open road
Where all the signs have been erased
It cannot be a road we know
We have to find our way

Find that cap you used to wear
Take a book you've never read
Leave the car keys on the shelf
And take the train instead

(chorus)
Let's find an open road
It doesn't matter where it goes
Mistakes you made are all behind you babe
From here on you are unknown

Leave the phone just let it ring
Let the batteries run down
Stop your talking, start to sing
It don't matter how you sound

Let's find an open road
It doesn't matter where it goes
Mistakes you made are all behind you babe
From here on you are unknown
