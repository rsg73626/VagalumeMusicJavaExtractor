PASSIN' THROUGH

Loose, cut it loose, break out or nothing changes
Sad and confused, don't wait until you hate it
Time is a lie, fill it up 'til it spills over
Don't measure life, looking back is gonna get you nowhere

(chorus)
Are we the ones, have we begun
Are we too good to be true
Are we alive, have we arrived
Or are we just passing through?

Days are ablaze, the wind blows and the windows rattle
I'm in a place, where
Music is the only thing that matters
Dance, so we dance, all around there is confusion
I've got no plans, so keep moving if that doesn't suits you

Are we the ones, have we begun
Are we too good to be true
Are we alive, have we arrived
Or are we just passing through?
