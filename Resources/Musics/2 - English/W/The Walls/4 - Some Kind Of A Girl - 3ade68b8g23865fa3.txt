SOME KIND OF A GIRL

she was some kind of a girl, 
skinny legs and braces even with an egg and spoon, 
she'd win all the races 
she was some kind of a girl, 
bluer than a moonbeam sweeter than a song bird, 
brighter than a daydream 
and when summer evenings light the sky 
and the day is holding back the night 
everything looks good about this life. 

she was some kind of a girl, 
working in a factory money for the family 
maybe something for the weekend 
she was some kind of a woman 
who never turned away from anyone in trouble or need 
she'd listen to your problem 

but something's not quite right 
everybody's taken pieces of her life 
call her mother, call her sister, call her wife. 

She was some kind of a girl, 
some kind of a girl 
some kind of a girl 
some kind...... 

but something's not quite right 
everybody's taken pieces of her life 
call her mother, call her sister, call her wife.

She was some kind of a girl, 
some kind of a girl 
some kind of a girl 
some kind.....
