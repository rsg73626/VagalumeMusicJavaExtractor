WE DRESS UP LIKE SNOWMEN

Consult your mouth, flapping wings beneath the bed
You lay down your innocence, though it is just half dead
It has crawled here to rest... and slowly it will die
So run your fingers through my skin
And I shall be made your music
We must ride the rougher paths to bliss
I can do it with a kiss

You were sitting on my Xmas tree
And you were looking down at me

Well, I went to the movies for three years
And I heard that you were busy going in and out of therapy
So you lost all my money and I cost you all your friends
They do not want to talk to you, but I do, I do, I do!

So we dress up like snowmen and run around your garden
Chanting "David is the monster!"
