KISS MY DRUMMER

Do you remember my hand in your hair when you wrapped your head in the hood of my mother's sweater?
Do you think of me when you listen to the Grateful Dead? Do you recall how much I hate them?
Does your heart stop beating and your skin turn white when you hear a girl with a French accent?
Cos I can't hear no Southern California slang or eat mango with cashew butter
Cos I can't wear that dress that shines so much I come from Sweden
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries

Well you tell me you could go with someone else
Rest your bones on a Spanish island
Did you already find yourself another girl who worships the Chili Peppers?
Are you really annoyed about giving me the dress that you made for me with your dad's shirt?
Cos I can't accept or forget you never kissed me like a stranger
Cos I don't want to know I won't get to kiss my drummer after the session
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries
Without breaking down in cries
