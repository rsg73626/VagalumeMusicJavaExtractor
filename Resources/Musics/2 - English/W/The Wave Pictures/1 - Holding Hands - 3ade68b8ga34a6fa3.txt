HOLDING HANDS

Holding hands, and we missed all the fireworks
Holding hands, holding hands
Holding hands, I was thinking about someone else
Holding hands with you

Holding hands, I didn't take an apple off the tree
Holding hands, holding hands
Holding hands, how long will you wait for me?
Holding hands with you

Please understand
Each time I held your hand
I was thiking about someone else

Holding hands, all that's left now is to get drunk
Holding hands, holding hands
Holding hands, and then your dad will pick you up
Holding hands with you

And you know I hate your mother
And you know I hate your dad
It's like we'd never dream of growing up
But think of what we could have had

Well, I don't really hate your mother
She's all right
But I really really hate your dad
