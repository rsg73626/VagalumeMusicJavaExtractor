COCAIN

You won't find any cocain in my house
	Only crap.....
	Suits me well if you give me some                verse#1
	But I won't accept
	I,am not a drunk man but i drink a little
        
                 (chorus)

     cause its a fuckin world we live and its a fuckin thing

     you wont find any cocain in my house only crap...
    
     I,am not a drunk man but i drink a little...
     
               (repeat verse chorus)
               (repeat verse chorus and verse #1)
       
               out of my house...
               
               out of my house...
                 
               out of my house...
