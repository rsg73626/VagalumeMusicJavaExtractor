FROZEN CROWS

There they come all stained 
be careful they yet weren't named
they where narcotics a little of opium in their brains 

Blood dripping down their vains
was something that made them insane
very scribled on their faces
was some kind of horror tatoo

                     (chorus)

they were people completely insane by there longs

they were humans lost in the world of drugs

looking for somekind of answer that would take them out of the world of  drugs

taking money from there parents to pay off  the way of  drugs

and that made them a bunch of frozen crows

they were a bunch of frozen crows

they were a bunch of frozen crows

they were a bunch of frozen crows
