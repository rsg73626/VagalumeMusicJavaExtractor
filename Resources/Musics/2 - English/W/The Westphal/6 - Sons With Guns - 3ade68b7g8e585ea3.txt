SONS WITH GUNS

Parents go to work leaving there kids to search
guns! guns!

there they go to school forgeting there parents rules 
taking in there bags
guns! guns!

and when they get to school they bring out there
guns! guns!


                              (chorus)

Sons with guns forgeting how it  runs
the bullet comes out and  kills someone's son
kids go to school saying that there cool 
but they forget and kill the hulliegan

take care of your sons and with your guns
because they can end up with runs
