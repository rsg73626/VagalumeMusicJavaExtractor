JUST ANOTHER DREAM

(chorus)

        I came back from work one day
        A really tough day
        I Though about the things I did in this day
        Then I went to bed
        Thinking about my friend
        A very sad man was my friend
        But I couldn't hide those things deep inside
        Of my heart
        I said bad things to him
        But he seemed to not care
        As I walked away
        I heard people say
        They said there was a man
        Who was going to suicide himself
        But when I saw who was that man
        He was my sad old friend
        
        (chorus 2)
        Then I realized....
        It was just another dream
        It was just another dream
        It was just another dream
        It was just another dream       
         
        a very awfull dream 
        Then I realized he was ok
        Just another dream
