SILVERWARE

People come in black, blue, and green,
	So many colors but I never see someone dressing silver
	The world is full of colors
	So many colors I get mixed up
	
	(CHORUS)
	Silverware
	Silverware
	Silverware
	The color that no one wears
	And when I go to heaven
	I'll see others dressed in silver
	The color that no one wears
	
	But someone else will use this color in something else
	I'll get fun by landing you my silverware
	I hope you have fun with my silverware
	Hey, give me back my fork
	My silver fork
	I meant it all wrong
	Now I want it back
	Too late for that
	
	(Repeat Chorus).
