DOORS

Beyond the boundries of your city's lights
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries
So many times you did not bring this on yourself
When the moment finally comes, I'll be there to help

On that day, when you need your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we've sheltered
We'll always be ready because we will always be there

When there's people crying in the streets
When they're starving for a meal to eat
When they simply need a place to make their beds
Right here underneath my wing, you can rest your head

On that day, when you need your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we've sheltered
We'll always be ready because we will always be there

Hope and pray, that you never need me
The rest assured I will not let you down
I walk beside you, but you may not see me
The strongest among you may not wear a crown

On the day when you need your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here
On that day when you don't have strength for the burning you bear
I'll be right here

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we've sheltered
We'll always be ready because we will always be there
