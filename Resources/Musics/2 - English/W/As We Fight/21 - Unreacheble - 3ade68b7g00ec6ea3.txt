UNREACHEBLE

Eternal upgrading standards.
Unreachble but still we aim to become anything but ourselves.
We accept everything though it rapes.
We accept everything though it kills.
Now I search for truth in all that I got left and I'll find salvation in
Me.
This world demands perfection.
They're killing us everyday.
They're raping our mind with false hope of a happier existence.
I'll rather be imperfect of perfection.
Life is pushed aside.
Profit held so high.
Unreacheble.
