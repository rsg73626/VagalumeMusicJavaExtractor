EMBRACE THIS HELL

I wrote my statement in blood and all that I have sacrificed to put an end
To their cries.
Was blindly ignored.
This is your time to die.
One last breath and it will all be gone.
My scream for justice disappears into the night.
This is what we created, driven by greed.
All heavens angels can't save us now.
Down in guilt we're sentenced.
To a lifetime in agony.
Consumed by despair we tear this world apart.
Every part of me aches.
I can't taste the disgust on my tongue.
Don't know how much longer I can endure this hell.
I see we're falling apart.
If you love this world so embrace this hell.
