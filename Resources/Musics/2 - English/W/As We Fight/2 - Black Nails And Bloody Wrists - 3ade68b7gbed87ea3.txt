BLACK NAILS AND BLOODY WRISTS

Dry those bloody - wrists and let's take a walk on the wilder side of town.
The night is young - my darling and you're so fuckin' beautiful.
This love could be - undying if you'll let me into your life.
My hands are shaking - and blood rushes to my head.
Hearts pumping faster, faster than ever before.
I wish that you were mine forever.
Dark days of sorrow will be your road to disaster.
Take my hand and let me show what this life could be.
Things have been so fuckin' crazy but it's such a tragedy.
That you saw this life as your enemy.
Embrace yourself and follow your heart.
Together we'll make it through.
