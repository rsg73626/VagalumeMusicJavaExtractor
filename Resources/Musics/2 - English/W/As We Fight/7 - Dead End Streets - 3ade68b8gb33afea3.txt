DEAD END STREETS

You sever all the ties between what’s right and wrong
You push the blame away because it’s just so hard to bear.
Still you can’t admit your pain.
Looking for something new.
Something new to claim and call your own.
Take a look in the fucking mirror, before you cast your guilt.
Before you judge me, take a look inside yourself.
Still you’re to sacred, to take a fucking stand.
Who would have thought after all these years that things would be this way.
I guess you can’t expect it to stay the fucking same.
Now we´ re all here and we are staring in fear.
Afraid to make a move.
To scared to fucking breathe.
We weren’t meant to be like this x2.
