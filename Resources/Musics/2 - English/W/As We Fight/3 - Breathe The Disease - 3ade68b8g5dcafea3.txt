BREATHE THE DISEASE

Breathe!
It’s the fight of your life.
The struggle that never ends.
I won’t breathe the disease anymore.
It’s time to set things straight.
Once and for all.
Swing your fist as hard as you can.
With every ounce of strength you have.
No longer will I be held down.
By your fucking social trends.
This ends right here, right now.
This is the end!
In search for acceptance we must all face our demons.
Grab the fear by the throat.
Put it to sleep and just let go.
