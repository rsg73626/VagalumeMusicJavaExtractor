IGNITE THE FIRE

What's done is done and what's said is said.
Still we live on no regrets.
Can't change the past.
So let's try to make the best of the years to come.
Ignite the fire to brighten this world.
And make the path of darkness disappear.
I will not go down without a fight.
At least we can fuckin' try.
We have the power, we have the strength.
Together we can make a change.
I walk this path for those who lived and died upholding their beliefs.
For those who ever remain true.
Remain true.
