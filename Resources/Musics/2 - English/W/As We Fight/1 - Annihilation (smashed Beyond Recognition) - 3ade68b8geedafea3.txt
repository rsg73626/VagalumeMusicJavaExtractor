ANNIHILATION (SMASHED BEYOND RECOGNITION)

You will never rest in your forsaken grave
You will never escape.
You see it in their faces, staring cold.
Eyes that could bury the entire world with guilt.
The horrors that they endured shall haunt you in your dreams.
You take this life and love for granted.
You see their wastelands and turn the other cheek
When the flames of hell comes crashing down you will be the first to go.
The first to go!
Smashed beyond recognition!
This world is an ugly place and we’re all forced to deal with it.
So get the fuck out of my face!!
I’m just like you trying to get by on what I know.
Making every day count as my last.
Annihilation!
Enemies will bleed.
We will never accept defeat.
We’re never on our knees.
Always fight to stay free!
