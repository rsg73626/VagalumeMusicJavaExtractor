BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER

We coming full force with all we got, 'cause we got nothing to lose.
Only a feeling in our hearts that we will pull through.
No looking back, 'cause past is past and that time has passed.
Straight from my heart I'll tell you this is where we belong.
This is our scene and we stand strong.
Bringing all the kids together with open minds and open hearts.
You can call it what you want cause we just don't care.
Our unity can't be beat.
Metal, punk or hardcore we stand as one, we stand strong.
Bringing it all together.
