LOST TO THE MADNESS

She didn't walk, very long.
Until she went too far.
No turning back, it's too late, devastated, falls to her knees.
All her pain unleashed in one scream.
One step too far is what killed her.
Forever lost.
And I shed a tear for every beautiful face lost to the madness.
She went all the way ignoring all she learned.
I'll never forget your face, it remains in my heart.
I'll never forget your remain in my heart.
