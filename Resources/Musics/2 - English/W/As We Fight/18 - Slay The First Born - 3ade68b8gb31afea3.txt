SLAY THE FIRST BORN

In the darkness
Beaten and torn.
As you walk through life carrying your scars.
From the times that you had to fight your way through.
Through love, through hate and despair.
I curse this day when everything felt like it was fallen from black skies.
Piercing through me like a thousand knives.
Tearing me into pieces
As I witness the birth of a new hell rising on us.
For every time, you took a shot at us.
Our revenge, will come tenfold.
Born to fight this war.
Slay the first born.
