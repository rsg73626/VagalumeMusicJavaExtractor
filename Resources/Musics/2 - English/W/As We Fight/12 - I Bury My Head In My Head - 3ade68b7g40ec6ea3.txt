I BURY MY HEAD IN MY HEAD

I bury my head in my hands.
I can't believe the words coming from your mouth.
How can you be so inhuman?
Can't you ever learn from the past?
Your ignorence overwhelmes me.
Now try for once to listen to your own words of hatred. Wake up!!
A dark soul of evil speaking words of impurity.
And you'll die with the words of regret on your lips.
Hiding behind your children.
To create an innocent image.
You took their lives away. Without a second of hesitation.
There is no word strong enough to describe what you deserve.
I hope you'll burn.
