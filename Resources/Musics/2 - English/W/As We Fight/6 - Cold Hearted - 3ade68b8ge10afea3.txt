COLD HEARTED

It feels like I'm on a race against time.
Cause there is so many things being shoved down our throats.
Drowning in expectations.
A Prewritten existence.
You can’t judge my heart.
When you’re standing from a far.
You got it all it wrong, thinking that you had it all.
cause you’re no different, no different then the rest.
What the fuck do you want from me?
What did you expect us to be?
After all that you pushed us through.
I will never shed a tear for you.
Not a single tear for you.
So save your breath.
Cold hearted.
(pick it up)
I’m not buying into this shit anymore
So save you breath and kill the lies.
