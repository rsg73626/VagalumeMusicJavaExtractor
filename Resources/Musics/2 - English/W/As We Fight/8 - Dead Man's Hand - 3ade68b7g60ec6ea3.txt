DEAD MAN'S HAND

I'll rise from the darkness and wander towards the light.
In search for reflections revealing the truth.
And sky turns red like the sun fades away.
The beauty of truth is cast aside.
Honesty becomes yet another lie.
Now I read the truth in a dead man's hand.
As I stare in the nothingeness I realise this world has gone to hell.
Burning for the consequences.
Paying the ultimate price.
One broken promise, another lie.
As we drown in empty words.
