WASTING DAYS

I wish that I could say "I live each day as my last".
Cause one day will it be the fuckin' last.
To me it seems so wrong to waste our precious years.
In this world of slavery, oppression will be our decay.
Set yourself free and fight back.
Take back what's rightfully yours.
Everyday is a struggle to survive.
Just trying to get by in this life.
Take your fuckin' life back!
