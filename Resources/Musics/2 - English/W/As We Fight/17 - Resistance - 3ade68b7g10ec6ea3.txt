RESISTANCE

The fire has awaken me in the ashes of my loved ones.
In evil they tear the flesh from the bone leaving no one behind.
Never will I give up as long as children are enslaved.
Behind your mask of greed you're fragile and
All the money in the world can't save you from me.
Everything that was cared for was taken away.
Now I'm lost in misery.
They may shetter my bones but they never kill my urge to fight.
This world of injustice.
A capitalistic regime.
Heaven is lost forever only hell exists.
Endless rain pouring down while the blood drips from their wrists.
A call for resistance.
With such will, to end the killing.
Until my very last breathe I'll fight you with all I've got left.
