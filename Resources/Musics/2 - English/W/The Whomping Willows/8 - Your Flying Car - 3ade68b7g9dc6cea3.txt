YOUR FLYING CAR

Harry, oh Harry Potter
I thought you were a little bit smarter
Concentrate just a little bit harder
When you’re riding
In your flying car

Oh Weasley, oh Ronald Weasley
I’d like to burn a curse on your whole family
You’re insulting my dignity
When you hit me
With your flying car

I know 
Boys will be boys
With a flying car
And they treat it like a toy
Next time
Consult me
‘Cause I know I treated you
With decency

Harry, oh Harry Potter
I thought you were a little bit smarter
Concentrate just a little bit harder
When you’re riding
In your flying car

Oh Weasley, oh Ronald Weasley
I’d like to burn a curse on your whole family
You’re insulting my dignity
When you hit me
With your flying car

I know
That you rule the school
But I cannot hold
What’s much longer then youth
Even when it looks you terrorize me
Cause this is the kind the blame
They put on the tree

Harry, oh Harry Potter
I thought you were a little bit smarter
Concentrate just a little bit harder
When you’re riding
In your flying car

Oh Weasley, oh Ronald Weasley
I’d like to burn a curse on your whole family
You’re insulting my dignity
When you hit me
With your flying car
