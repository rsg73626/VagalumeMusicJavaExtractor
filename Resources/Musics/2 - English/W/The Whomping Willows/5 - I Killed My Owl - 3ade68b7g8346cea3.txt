I KILLED MY OWL

I used to like writing you letters
It was almost like being together
I let my nature get the best of me
So if you’re wondering what 
You haven’t heard from me

I killed my owl
I killed my owl
I killed my owl
I killed my owl, oh oh
I killed my owl
I killed my owl
I killed my owl, oh

I need another arm of branches
Something other then Horatio Sanchez
But I let my nature get the best of me
So if you’re wondering what 
You haven’t heard from me

I killed my owl
I killed my owl
I killed my owl
I killed my owl, oh oh
I killed my owl
I killed my owl
I killed my owl, oh
