A HEART WORTH LOVING

It’s warm and happy at Hogwarts
But I’m alone 
The same place I’ve been for so long
Seen you round a couple of times
And you filled me with a light
That I never felt before
Hermione
What I’m saying might be awkward
And it might seem kind of strange
I can’t blame you for feeling that way
Even though we’re different species
I think you’d understand
If you just gave me a chance
Hermione(4x)
I’m just a tree
Just a tree
If you could see
Inside me
You’d see a heart worth loving
You’d see a hand worth holding(3x)
Hermione(4x)
People tell me love is painful
I should just stay away
But I’d be lying to myself
Your loving smile
Your bushy hair
And your compassion too
I know you’d never let me down
Hermione(4x)
I’m just a tree
Just a tree
If you could see inside me
You’d see a heart worth loving
You’d see a hand worth holding(3x)
Hermione
