SONG FOR LUNA

Despite what you heard in track four
There’s a girl I like more
And I swear that it’s not a rebound
She plays in a band
She’s got really nice… hands
And you’re lucky if you’ve seen her around
She’s got her own style
She’s good for a smile
She makes a rainy day seem brighter
And she might be a bit strange
But if I get her in range
I’ll prove that I’m a lover, not a fighter

I’m alone all the time
Going out of my mind
Making sense of this situation
With my heart in my hands
I need an alternate plan
Something free of these complications
Maybe you’re weird enough
To give me all of your love
I can give you what you always dreamed of
Be your lover and friend
By your side till the end
Something real in this world of pretend
