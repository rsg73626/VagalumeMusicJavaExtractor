CEDRIC HAD IT COMING

Oh, Cedric why’d you go into that maze?
Haven’t you ever seen a Hollywood movie before?
In which a minor character gets slain
To benefit the survival of the big star
… It’s such a cliche

You’ve been at Hogwarts long enough to know
That Harry’s gonna get through whatever comes his way
Then there’s that whole business with Cho Chang
There had to be a means of getting you out of the way
… It’s such a cliche

Cedric Diggory
Were you too proud to see
Your days were numbered when
You stepped in the ring with him
You were unaware
That you were just a spare
You’re six feet underground
And Harry’s still around

We all agree you’re braver than most boys
But that’s no reason to go and get yourself killed
Did you notice there’s no scar on your forehead?
And what kind of hero dresses in yellow anyway?
… It’s such a cliche
