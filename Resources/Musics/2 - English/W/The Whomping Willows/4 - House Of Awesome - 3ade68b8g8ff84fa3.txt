HOUSE OF AWESOME

The students at Hogwarts are sorted into Houses according to
Whatever that shifty Sorting Hat says they ought to do
I asked Dumbledore if I could be sorted
He said, “Sorry, Whompy, but I could get reported
to the Ministry of Magic for incorrect procedure -
You’re not a wizard, you’re a tree.”

So I’m starting a new House and it’s called Awesome
I’m starting a new House and it’s called Awesome
I’m starting a new House and it’s called Awesome

Well, the House of Awesome is a place for anyone without a home
Regardless of race, religion, creed, gender, or sexual preference
We accept whites, we accept blacks
We accept rebel freedom fighters on horseback
We accept Asians, we accept Jews
We accept everyone and that includes you!

I’m starting a new House and it’s called Awesome
