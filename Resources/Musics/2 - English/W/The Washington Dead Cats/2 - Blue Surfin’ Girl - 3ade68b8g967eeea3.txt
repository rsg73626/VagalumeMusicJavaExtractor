BLUE SURFIN’ GIRL

Gonna tell you the tale about a pretty Blue girl
She’s the one surfing in the mornin’ break

can You imagine her surfing in the mornin light
that’s when she gets satisfaction
But you won’t see her rolling in my arms in the evening light 
That’s when she gets a new kind of action

Blue blue surfin’girl 
Blue blue blue surfin’girl
My blue surfin’ girl

She surfs all day on the biggest wave
Break the rules & fly into a rage

She’s surfing all day long to pick up the good vibration
But sh’es got a better plan anyway
She’s loving me every night & giving me excitation
Alone in my little hideaway

Blue blue surfin’girl 
Blue blue blue surfin’girl
My blue surfin’ girl

My board is loosing wax & I’m gonna leave the track
She says bye bye & surf away
She the one she’s the one she’s the one who puts me on the rack
My brain is surfing on the milky way
