TREAT ME BAD

I’m a tigerman lookin for a wild love
Little girl don’t you give me no sweet names
I will love you little baby until we crash
But Little baby if one day we gotta crash
Don’t you even try to treat me nice
And just treat me bad
I ain’t no square baby I don’t care
I wanna feel the thrill of your claws
I will love you little baby until we crash
But Little baby if one day we gotta crash
Don’t you even try to treat me nice
And just treat me bad
You broke my heart the day you quit me
Don’t give me no hopes or regrets
I don’t wanna suffer waiting for you
Be rude, immoral please treat me bad
If you quit me I don’t wanna cry
Please baby make me feel no regrets
I will love you little baby until we crash
But Little baby if one day we gotta crash
Don’t you even try to treat me nice
And just treat me bad
I will love you little baby until we crash
But Little baby if one day we gotta crash
Don’t you even try to treat me nice
And just treat me bad
