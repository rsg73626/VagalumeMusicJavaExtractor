UNDER THE COCONUT TREES

We make profits, got no time to waste
But the rich still rich & the poor the same
fed up with my job fed up with my life
I wanna live the city now
working like a dog for a boss I hate
& No time for friends & no time for love
I decide to quit & to take my chance
I wanna live the city now

I wanna sleep under the coconut trees
I wanna sleep under the coconut trees
I wanna sleep under the coconut trees
It the place where I long to be

Gotta find a native girl to scratch my back
I’m gonnna swim with the fish under the blue skie
I’m gonna have my share of the apple pie
Here I long to be
Gotta drink all night & sleep all day
Rum & coca cola & bossa nova
Chicks in bikini doing the hula
Here I’m gonna lay 

I pick & choose the life i want
& say aloha to the big dirty city
Hawaian sunset on the deep blue sea
Here the place i wanna stay
Rock the place with a Hukulele
Rock it rock it all night long
To the sound of the bongo do the mambo
C’mon c’mon let’s go

I wanna sleep under the coconut trees
I wanna sleep under the coconut trees
I wanna sleep under the coconut trees
It the place where I long to be
