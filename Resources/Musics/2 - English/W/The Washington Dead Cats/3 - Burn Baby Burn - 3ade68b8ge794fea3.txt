BURN BABY BURN

Comin’ straight from the outskirt
leather boots and mini skirt
She loves danger
Demolition derby driver
Flamin’ like nitroglycerine
Her heart burns with gazoline
She’s the hottest
Demolition derby driver
She’s kickin ass & rockin’
You can’t drive away from her
You love that danger
Demolition derby driver
She drives like an Hurricane
Driving at the speed of light all trough the night
Ready to fight, it might sound extreme but she burns
She a demolition derby queen
A motor psycho rebel
On the road to hell
Demolition derby driver
Today the race is on
She’s a destructive machine
But tonight
She becomes a love machine
Burns baby burns
She drives like an Hurricane
Driving at the speed of light all trough the night
Ready to fight, it might sound extreme but she burns
Comin’ straight from the outskirt
leather boots and mini skirt
She loves danger
Demolition derby driver
Flamin’ like nitroglycerine
Her heart burns with gazoline
She’s the hottest
Demolition derby driver
She burns the road and she burns your brain too
She a demolition derby queen
A motor psycho rebel
On the road to hell
Demolition derby driver
She’s not a good cookin’
But when it’s all about lovin’
She loves danger
It’s time to ring the alarm bell
Burns baby burns
She drives like an Hurricane
Driving at the speed of light all trough the night
Ready to fight, it might sound extreme but she burns
