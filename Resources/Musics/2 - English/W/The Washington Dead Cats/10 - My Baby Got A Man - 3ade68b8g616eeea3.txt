MY BABY GOT A MAN

I do what I want and I do it may way
If I wanna see my friend leave me alone
I wanna be I wanna jump’n’ jive
Play the voodoo blues
I want you cooking and for me waiting
I want you treating me like a king
You ùmust be so happyt girl
the way you’re treatin’
My baby got a man
My baby got a another man
She said you ma ke me bluye I got to leave you
If you beat me again I’ll call the red & blue
I said girl youi gotta understand
I maybe drinkin’ and lyin’
But don’t you make my heart bleeding
She said you thing you’ve got everything
But you ain’t got no heart and it still missing
My baby got a man
My baby got a another man
