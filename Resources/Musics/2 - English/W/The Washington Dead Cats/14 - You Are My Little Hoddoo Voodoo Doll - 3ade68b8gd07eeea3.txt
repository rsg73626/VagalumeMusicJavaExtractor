YOU ARE MY LITTLE HODDOO VOODOO DOLL

She was black, I was white
We got hooked up at first sight
She was cool, I was tight
but she always won the fight
Time passing by changed her mind
I will never call her mine
moon was blue We were through
Voodoo will bring her back
little hoodoo voodoo doll
little hoodoo voodoo doll
She’s my little Hoodoo voodoo doll
She’s my little Hoodoo voodoo doll
Now she’s gone I don’t know why
Why did I have to go and lie
You had a grirgri don’t say maybe
Coz you really put a spell on me
You broke my heart stole my soul
I can’t believe it was your goal
moon was blue We were through
Voodoo will bring her back
little hoodoo voodoo doll
little hoodoo voodoo doll
She’s my little Hoodoo voodoo doll
She’s my little Hoodoo voodoo doll
