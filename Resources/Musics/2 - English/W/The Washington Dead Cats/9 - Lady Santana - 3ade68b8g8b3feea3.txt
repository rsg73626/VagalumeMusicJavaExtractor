LADY SANTANA

Here she comes way cross hell
Where the angels fear to tread
A satanic venus a real bombshell
Walks like a sinner puts me on fire
I loved her at first sight
She’s haunting all my nights
I can’t say a word when she’s around
She filled my world bury me underground
She my Lady Satana, Lady Satana, Lady Satana
Some may smoke, some may drink
Or do wild and crazy things
Some even try benzendrine
She’s my everything my evil gazoline
She my Lady Satana, Lady Satana, Lady Satana
I got a black cat bone and an heart of stone
I can’t resist her devilish beauty
I’m damned for eternity
Treat her nice or she puts you on ice
Dont you look back ! back at her
Or you’ll fill me with anger
Sooner or later you’ll be in danger
I hear her name and I’m aflame
She my Lady Satana, Lady Satana, Lady Satana
