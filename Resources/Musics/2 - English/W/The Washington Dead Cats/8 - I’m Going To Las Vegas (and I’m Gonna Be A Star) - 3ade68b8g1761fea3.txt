I’M GOING TO LAS VEGAS (AND I’M GONNA BE A STAR)

You know how much I love you
You know how much I care
You know you drive me wild
With your big green eyes
And your long blond hair
There is no use in asking
Coz you’ll get no reply
A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do
Hush now baby, don’t you cry
Words of love won’t get you far
So I’ll leave my baby
But I’ll take the car
Coz I’m going to Las Vegas and I’m gonna be a star
Going to Las Vegas and I’m gonna be a star
I need your sweet caressess
I need your gentle touch
What you got I need a lot
But the price to pay is way to much
So I’ll spin the wheel of fortune
Lady luck will come my way
I’ll throw the dice and take a chance
That’s the kind of game I play
Look out ! get out of my way
Look out ! get out of my way
Words of love won’t get you far
So I’ll leave my baby
But I’ll take the car
Coz I’m going to Las Vegas and I’m gonna be a star
Going to Las Vegas and I’m gonna be a star
