CRAZY VOODOO WOMAN

I’m just a lonesome soul
And I’m under the spell
Of a crazy voodoo woman beyond the valley of death
Lies a city of blood
There’s a sinner like a devil in disguise
& she’s calling out to me
Wherever I go I know
I know she won’t forsake me
Voodoo woman has got me
She burns me & she breaks me
Crazy voodoo woman
Won’t you leave me alone
She’s like my ball & chain
I’m the prisonner of her love
She puts my heart in jail
& throws away the keys
Baby I wanna be of my own
Hate & love put me down
Crazy voodoo woman has got me
She burns me & she breaks me
Crazy voodoo woman
Won’t you leave me alone
leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Tears are falling from my eyes
Like leaves from the trees
You’re all I’m longing for
I need you more & more Crazy voodoo woman
Won’t you leave me alone
