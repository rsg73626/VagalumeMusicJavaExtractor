I’M A DEAD CAT

I live on the edge of town
I’m a cat on a hot tin roof
I got no time to loose Is the way I choose
I got 9 lives baby to live in one
Livin’, lovin’ & gettin’ loose
I won’t put my nose in the noose
Don’t cross my path or you’ll pay the bill
Beware my kisses kill
On the highest Hill Feel the thrill
Get into that moonlit swing
let our bodies move, move in harmony
Grrrr Baby That’s what I like
I’m a Dead Cat I’m a Dead Cat
Relax by the fire
let’s get closer & closer
Short days, long nights starlight in your hair
Don’t argue you’ll see what a cat can do
I got 9 lives
& a nite to live them all
Don’t cross my path or you’ll pay the bill
Beware my kisses kill
On the highest Hill Feel the thrill
Make good use of my skill
let’s our body rock, rock in harmony
Grrrr Baby That’s what I like
I’m a Dead Cat
I’m a Dead Cat
Got too much cat class for the rats arounds
The city is my playground
When the darkness comes I’m rythm’ bound
I wanna growl till the moon is shining bright
I climb on the highest roof to call my dead cats back
Beware baby
I gotta the right to growl at night
I gotta the right to look for a fight
I gotta the right to scratch & bite
Grrrr baby that’s what I like
I’m a Dead Cat I’m a Dead Cat
