13 IS MY LUCKY NUMBER

Is the day we met forever
Is the day I always remember
13 is my Lucky Number
please take this song to my lover
I see her face & will surrender
When a black cat cross my way
it’s got to be my lucky day
I don’t believe in destiny
With that red smile on your face
You tamed the tiger into a lover
please sweetiepie love me tender
13 is my Lucky Number
Is the day we met forever
Is the day I always remember
13 is my Lucky Number
Is the day we met forever
Is the day I always remember
Gotta get gotta get number 13
13 is my Lucky Number
Is the day we met forever
Is the day I always remember
Luck was my lady tonight
