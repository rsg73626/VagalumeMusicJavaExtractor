WAIKIKI BAY

He was a regular guy
With a hang ten style
Happy when the surf was up
But there ain’t no wave
That’s gonna save him
Johnny - He’s in love


Take a look at his eye’s
He’s hyp-no-tized
He treats him with a heart of stone
But he ‘ll never break free
Of her devil-ry
Coz Johnny’s – he’s in love


So hang’em high
Let the good guy’s die
Coz the devil’s gotta have his fun
And she’s as mean as a voodoo queen
And johnny he’s in love


Her spell will send us straight to hell
And if that ain’t bad enough
Waikiki bay has had it’s day
Coz Johnny – he’s in love


(I wanna get high on the tubes I ride
I wanna be a slave to the wave)
