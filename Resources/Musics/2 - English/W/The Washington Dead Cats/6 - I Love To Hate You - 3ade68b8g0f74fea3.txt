I LOVE TO HATE YOU

You know you made me love you like
A spider loves the fly
A tiger loves the flesh
You know you made me love you
Like Like only a devil can
Like a fire loves the ice
A lightning loves a tree
A storm loves the peaceful place
A devil lookinâ€™ for a soul
You know you made me love you
Like only a devil can
You bewitched me so please set my soul free
You bewitched me so please set my soul free
You made me love you like
Lucrece loved Sextus
Machiavelli loved his enemy
Neron Loved Rome
You know you made me love you
Like only a devil can
You know how much I love to hate you
Because you made me love you
You know how much I love to hate you
Coz I can kill for a girl like you
You made me love you like
A knife in my heart
Poison in my veins
A rope around my neck
A bullet in my head
You know you made me love you
Like only a woman can
