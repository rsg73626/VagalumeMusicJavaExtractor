MY FIRST MURDER

Day one, first victim
My first murder
No Guns, no ammo
Only my imagination
Barbed-Wire
Around your throat
Will show you
What it means to cry

Come the night
I will take you down
One moment
This kill will take one moment
As the spikes
Dive into your flesh
And my job
Will be over and done

I will tear you apart
When you least expect it
