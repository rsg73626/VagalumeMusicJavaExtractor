ONE BULLET LEFT

I'm sitting here alone
Surrounded by a thousand rifles
Hiding in this room so cold
Waiting for them to find me

If they get their hands on me
I know what's waiting for me
Torture beyond my wildest dreams
No-one there to hear my screams

One bullet left in my gun
One bullet left to make it right
One bullet left for my salvation
One bullet left to say goodnight

There is no reinforcements
There's no-one to come back for me
Only one to knock the heaven's gates
Only one to set me free
Only one to set me free

They're at the door
Seconds away from breaking it down

One bullet left in my gun
One bullet left to make it right
One bullet left for my salvation
One bullet left to say goodnight

One bullet left...
Goodbye...
