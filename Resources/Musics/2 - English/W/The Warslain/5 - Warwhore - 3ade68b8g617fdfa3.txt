WARWHORE

Welcome to my world
It is time to die
Today the evil takes its form
And again is ready to fly

The roaring canons set the pace
For the prelude of destruction
The bastards shall perish
And it's your choice to be one of them

The warwhore is ready to ride
The calibers count your time
The canons are shining bright
And are ready to spit fire

The war has now begun
And our forces taste the blood
The bullets play the chords
For the melodies of the chaintracks

The warwhore is ready to ride
The calibers count your time
The canons reflect the light
And will burn all in sight

The roaring canons set the pace
For the prelude of destruction
The bastards shall perish
And it's your choice to be one of them
