WON'T COME HOME

What is is now different than it might have been
When a storm tears from the sky
We're writing new history it starts with today
You can see them if you try

Feels like stealing 
Where'd they go
Gone forever 
Never be back home

They won't come home
They won't come home 
They won't come home

The loss to young lovers whose dreams won't come true
When a storm tears from the sky
The pain of a mother whose son won't come home
When a star falls from the sky

All that you know and love washes away
When a storm tears form the sky
A sudden disaster turns brightness to grey
And the birds refuse to fly
