WATER

The foreman over there hates the gang,
The poor people on the farms get it so rough,
Truck drivers drive like the devil,
The policemen they're acting so tough.
They need water,
Good water,
They need water,
And I'm sure there isn't one of us here
Who'd say no to somebody's daughter.
No, no, no, no, no.

The foreman over there hates the gang,
The poor people on the farms get it so rough,
Truck drivers drive like the devil,
The policemen they're acting so tough.
They need water,
Good water,
They need water,
And maybe somebody's daughter.

Indian Lake is burning,
The New York skyline is hazy,
The River Thames is turning dry,
The whole world is blazing.
We need water,
Wow yeah good water,
Ooh we need water,
And maybe somebody's daughter.

Ah gimme gimme good water,
Ah gimme gimme gimme good water,
Ah gimme good water,
Please don't refuse me, mister,
I seen your daughter at the oasis
And I'm beginning to blister.

My Chevrolet just made steam,
Your crop is laying foul,
My grass skirt's lost its green,
I'm alive but I don't know how.
I need water, good good water,
They need water,
Gimme gimme gimme good water,
Wow, gimme gimme gimme good water,
Gimme gimme gimme good water,
Come on gimme gimme gimme...

[faintly:] Champagne!
