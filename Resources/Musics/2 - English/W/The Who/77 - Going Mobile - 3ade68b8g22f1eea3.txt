GOING MOBILE

I'm going home
And when I want to go home
I'm going mobile
Well I'm gonna find a home on wheels
see how it feels
Goin' mobile
Keep me moving

I can pull up by the curb
I can make it on the road
Goin' mobile
I can stop in any street
And talk with people that we meet
Goin' mobile
Keep me moving, mm

Out in the woods
Or in the city
It's all the same to me
When I'm driving free
The world's my home
When I'm mobile, ey woo, beep beep

Play the tape machine
Make the toast and tea
When I'm mobile
Well, I can lay in bed with only highway ahead
When I'm mobile
Keep me moving

Keep me moving
Over fifty
Keep me groovin'
Just a hippie gypsy
Come on move now
Movin'
Keep me movin' yeah

Keep me movin', movin', movin', yeah
Movin' yeah
Mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile

I don't care about pollution
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy
That's my solution
Watch the police and the taxman miss me!
I'm mobile! Oh yeah he he
Mobile, mobile, mobile, yeah
