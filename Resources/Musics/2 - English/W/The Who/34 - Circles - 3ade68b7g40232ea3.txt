CIRCLES

Circles, my head is going round in circles 
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool, draggin' me down. 

Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track 
Dizziness will make my feet walk back, walk right back to you. 

Everything I do, I think of you 
No matter how I try, I can't get back 

These circles, leading me back to you 

Round and around and around and a... 

round and round like a fool I go 
Down and down in the pool I go 
Draggin' me down 

Just one thing could kill the pain of losin' you 

But it gets me so dizzy that I'm walkin' right back again 
Back to you 

Time will tell if these dreams are near his plan 
Though I left I'm comin' back 
Comin' on back to you 

Down and down in the pool I go 
Draggin' me down
