I'M THE ONE

Every year is the same
And i feel it again,
I'm a loser...no chance to win
Leaves start falling,
Come down is calling,
Loneliness starts sinking in
But i'm one
I am one

And i can see
That this is me,
And i will be,
You'll all see
I'm the one

Where do you get
Those blue blue jeans?
Faded patched secret so tight
Where do you get
That walk oh so lean?
Your shoes and your shirts
All just right
But i'm one
I am one

And i can see
That this is me,
And i will be,
You'll all see
I'm the one

I got a gibson
Without a case
But i can't get that even tanned look on my face
I'll fitting clothes
And i blend in the crowd,
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud
But i'm one
I am one

And i can see
That this is me,
And i will be,
You'll all see
I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
