FRAGMENTS

Are we breathing out or breathing in 
Are we leaving life or moving in 
Exploding out imploding in 
Ingrained in good or stained in sin 

Are we breathing out or breathing in 
Are we leaving life or moving in 
Are we breathing out or breathing in 
Are we breathing in 

We are a million fragments 
Exploding outwards 
Like broken glass we damage even in defeat 
We are tiny pieces 
Falling now in ___ 
Like snowflake crystals building on the city streets 

Snowflakes falling [X4] 

Are we the parts 
Are we the whole 
Are we the thoughts 
Are we the soul 
Parts of me this is true 
Parts of me belong to you 

Are we breathing out or breathing in 
Are we leaving life or moving in 
Exploding out imploding in 
Ingrained in good or stained in sin 
Are we the parts 
Are we the whole 
Are we the thoughts 
Are we the soul 
The Parts of me and this is true 
The parts of me the parts of you 

Belong to you...and you...and you...
