TWO THOUSAND YEARS

Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Have I waited

To ask if I have loved you
To know if I have served you
To find if I've obeyed you
To know if I've betrayed you

Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousnad years
Have I waited

Then find I can't be perfect
Not even a perfect snake
To know that we are hated
You suffer for my sake

Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Have I waited

And so I have a chance to love
As you intended
You really lived and died for me
Is the waiting really ended

Two thousand years
Long, long years
Long, long, long, long years
I have waited
Two thousand long, long years
Two thousand long, long years
Two thousand long, long years
Two thousand long, long years
Two thousand long, long years
Two thousand long, long years
