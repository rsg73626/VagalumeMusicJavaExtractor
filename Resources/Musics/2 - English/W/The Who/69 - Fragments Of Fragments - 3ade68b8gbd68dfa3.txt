FRAGMENTS OF FRAGMENTS

Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving on
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we breathing in

We are tiny pieces
Falling now and settling
Like snowflake crystal
Building on the city street

Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling

Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
Belong to you

Breathing out
Breathing in
Breathing out
Breathing in
Breathing out
Breathing in

Belong to you
And you
And you
And you...
