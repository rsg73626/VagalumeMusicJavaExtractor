EMINENCE FRONT

The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks
And people forget
Forget they're hiding.

Behind an eminence front
Eminence front - It's a put on.
It's an eminence front - it's an Eminence Front
It's a put on
It's an eminence Front - Eminence front...

Come on join the party
Dress to kill
Won't you come on join the party
Dress to kill.
Dress to kill.

Drinks flow
People forget
That big wheel spins, the hair thins
People forget
Forget they're hiding.
The news slows
People forget
The shares crash, hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget they're hiding.

Behind an eminence front
An Eminence front - it's a put on
It's just an eminence Front....

Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to kill
Dress yourself to kill.
