WE GOT A HIT

We got our folks together 
We broke down barriers 
We found a dream to dream 
We were the carriers 

We got rich and famous 
Papers at our door 
We talked a load of crap 
They just wanted more 

We got a hit (good good news, we got a hit) 
We got a hit (good good news, we got a hit) 
We got a hit (good good news, we got a hit) 
We got a hit (good good news,we...) 
(We got a hit) 
We got a hit 
We got a hit 
Ooh we got a hit 

We got our folks together 
We broke down barriers 
We found a dream to dream 
We were the carriers 
We were the carriers 

We got a hit (good good news, we got a hit) 
We got a hit (good good news,we...)
