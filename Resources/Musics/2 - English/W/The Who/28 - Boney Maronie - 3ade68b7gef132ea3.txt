BONEY MARONIE

i got a girl named bony moronie
she's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
i see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
not very fat, just skin and bones

i love her, and she loves me
boy, how happy we can be
makin love underneath the apple tree

my one and only, she's my hearts desire
she's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
gonna get married on a night in june
rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon

i love her, and she loves me
boy, how happy we can be
makin love underneath the apple tree

told her mama and her papa too
just exactly what we're gonna do
we're gonna get married in a night in june
to rock and roll in the light of the silvery moon

i love her, and she loves me
boy, how happy we can be
makin love underneath the apple tree
