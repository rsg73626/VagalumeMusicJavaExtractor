UNHOLY TRINITY

Three kids from the neighborhood
Three different lives
Three different ways to be
The identical smiles

We're not the same
But we can talk
We kiss and link our arms
We take a walk

We watch the tide ever way
Carry our ides through the sea
We hear the music
Remember being free

We are unholy trinity
And love forever
But we are the sea
We are the ocean
We are the free
We are unholy trinity
