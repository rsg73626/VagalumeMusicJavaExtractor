BE LUCKY

[Intro]
Be Lucky
Be, be lucky, be lucky, some

Be lucky, gotta make it your own
Get it from a bottle or squeeze it from a stone
Like I remember the best way home
Here comes the 7, it won? t be long

[Chorus]
Be Lucky
(Better not forget, oh no)
Be Lucky
(A very simple thing)
Be Lucky
(Better make a bet, uh huh)
Be lucky
(Or you might never win)

Be lucky, place your bet
Put it on a nag who ain? t done nothin? yet
Make sure it was born in the Ramborn Hills
A Kentucky farm could pay your bills

You wanna travel across the great divide
You really gotta have some luck on your side
You wanna climb without a safety line
Ac Dc, it? s gonna be fine

[Chorus]
Be lucky
(Better not forget your?)
Be lucky
(A very simple thing)
Be lucky
(Better place a bet, uh huh)
Be lucky
(Or you might never win)

If you wanna sell you gotta kiss and tell
Then you gotta do a cover of? Highway To Hell?
If you wanna fight, if you need to fight
Then you better get ready to rock through the night

Be lucky, gotta make it your own
Get it from a bottle, squeeze it from a stone
Like I can remember, the best way home
Here comes the 7, it won? t be long

You wanna travel cross the great divide
You really got to have some luck on your side
You wanna climb without a safety line
Daft Punk will tell you that its gonna be fine

Its gonna be fine

Little Kylie? s he? s still on time

Coming up!

I? m Here, I? m Ready

Be lucky
(If you wanna hit, just finish it)
Be lucky
(Dress it up?)
Be lucky
(Sounds nice, my advice is)
Be lucky, some

Don? t bet on paradises
