MY WAY

Well, listen, pretty baby; let's go out tonight
Tell your mama not to worry; everything's gonna be all right
Don't let me hear you talkin'; just be there when I call

'Cause what I do I do my way, 
or it won't be done at all
Oh little girl, better hear what I say
I'm an easy-goin' guy, but I always gotta have my way

I was born a tiger; I always had my way
Nobody's gonna change me this or any other day
Don't let me hear you argue when I say funky junk
'Cause a woman ain't been born yet, they can play me for a chump
Oh little girl, better hear what I say
I'm an easy-goin' guy, but I always gotta have my way

(instrumental)

Well, don't ask me for the reasons, don't ever wonder why
When I walk away
