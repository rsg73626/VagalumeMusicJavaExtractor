IS IT ME?

I guess by now you're feeling sorry for me
Well that's the way this story's meant to be
Take a look around, you won't see much that's right
Your kid might be in the Boy Scouts, but he's kicking queers at night

Tell me a single thing life teaches you
Tell me a single death that reaches you
You deny you've got a soul to preach to
Try and save him, I beseech you

I've done all I can, he never cut his hair
I washed my hands of the whole affair
Twenty years in jail seems a little harsh
But I bow to the law and the chosen path

Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

I guess by now you're feeling sorry for him
Well that's okay, 'cause they put him in the bin
Take a look around, take a walk out in the park
You can still see all the old ladies scared stiff of the dark

Tell me a single thing life teaches you
Tell me a single death that reaches you
You deny you've got a soul to preach to
Try and save him, I beseech you

Tell me a single thing life teaches you
(I've done all I can, he never cut his hair)
Tell me a single death that reaches you
(I washed my hands of the whole affair)
You deny you've got a soul to preach to
(Twenty years in jail seems a little harsh)
Try and save him, I beseech you
(But I bow to the law and the chosen path)

Tell me a single thing life teaches you
(I've done all I can, he never cut his hair)
Tell me a single death that reaches you
(I washed my hands of the whole affair)
You deny you've got a soul to preach to
(Twenty years in jail seems a little harsh)
Try and save him, I beseech you
(But I bow to the law and the chosen path)

Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
