SATURDAY NIGHT'S ALRIGHT (FOR FIGHTING)

It's getting late have you seen my mates,
Go on and tell me when the boys get here.
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock,
Want to get a belly full of beer.

My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots with a handful of grease in her hair.

Hey... Don't give us none of your aggravation,
We've had it with your discipline.
Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, get a little action in.
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance alight. 
Cause' Saturday Night's the night I like,
Saturday Nights Alright..
Alright, Alright!

Well, we're packed pretty tight in here tonight and I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right.
I may use a little muscle to get what I need, and sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me!".

A couple of the sounds that I really like are the sound of a switchblade and a motorbike.
I'm a juvenile product of the working class, who's best friend floats in the bottom of a glass.

Don't give us none of your aggravation, we've had it with your discipline.
Saturday Night's Alright for fighting, to get a little action in.
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance alight.
Cause Saturday Night's the night I like,
Saturday Night's Alright...
Alright, Alright!

Chorus: Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!........

Pete T.: Take me to the pilot, lead me to the chamber,
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger,
Na na na, na na na.....

Chorus: Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!........
