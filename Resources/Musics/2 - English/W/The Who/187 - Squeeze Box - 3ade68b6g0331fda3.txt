SQUEEZE BOX

Mama's got a squeeze box she wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home, he never gets no rest
'Cause she's playing all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box, Daddy never sleeps at night

Well, the kids don't eat and the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music in the whole damn street
'Cause she's playing all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box, Daddy never sleeps at night

She goes in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out
She's playing all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box, Daddy never sleeps at night

She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
Mama's got a squeeze box, Daddy never sleeps at night

[break]

She goes in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out
'Cause she's playing all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box, Daddy never sleeps at night
