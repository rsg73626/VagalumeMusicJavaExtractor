DAILY RECORDS

This could be suffering
This could be pleasure
I'm unaware of any difference
My head is aging
My balls are aching
But I'm not looking for deliverence

This could be letting on
This could be highly cut
I'm unaware of ~any difference
One says it can't be done
Then somebody does it - but

I'm not watching for equivalents.

I just don't quite know how to wear my hair no more
No sooner cut it than they cut it even more
Got to admit that I created private worlds
Cold sex and booze don't impress my little girls

Daily records
Just want to be making daily records
Try to avoid the bad news in the letters
Just wanna be making records
Play in - play out - fade in - fade out
Making records day in - day out

And they say it's just a stage in life
But I know by now the problem is a stage
And they say just take your time and it'll go away
But I know by now I'm never gonna change

I could be losing you
I could be coming through
I'm unaware of any difference
You still support me now
You love me anyhow
And I am still under your influence

We've had some years of hate
But now we're in the eights
I'm unaware of any difference
I need you even more
My money keeps me poor
I'm still amazed at your omnipotence

I look at baggy suits and leather capped with puke
I look at Richmond married couples denim look
I watch my kids grow up and ridicule the bunch~
When you are eleven the whole world's out to lunch

Daily records
Just wanna keep making daily records
Can't exist no more in chains and fetters
Just wanna keep making records
Play in - play out - fade in - fade out
Making records day in - day out

Just wanna be making daily records.
