RELAY

You can hear it in the street, see it in the dragging feet,
The word is getting out about control,
Spies they've come and gone, the story travels on,
The only quiet place is inside your soul.

From tree to tree, from you to me,
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway,
Every single dream, wrapped up in the scheme,
They all get carried on the relay.

Relay, things are brewing,
Relay, something's doing,
Relay, there's a revolution,
Relay, relay, hand me down a solution, yeah.
Pass it on, come on, a relay.

Someone disapproves of what you say and do,
I was asked to see what I could really learn you,
Don't believe your eyes, they're telling only lies,
What is done in the first place don't concern you.

Relay, relay, hand me down a solution, yeah.
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on, hey you, pass it on,
We're on the relay, get a moving, get on a moving on,
The relay, the relay, the relay, the relay.
