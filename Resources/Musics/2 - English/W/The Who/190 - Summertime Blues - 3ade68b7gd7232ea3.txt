SUMMERTIME BLUES

Summertime Blues

Well, I'm a'gonna raise a fuss,
An' I'm a'gonna raise a holler
I've been working all summer
Just to try and earn a dollar
Well I went to the boss
Said I had a date
The boss said "No dice, son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a'gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and poppa told me
"Son you gotta earn some money,
If you want to use the car
To go out next Sunday."

Well I didn't go to work
I told the boss I was sick
He said "You can't use the car
'cause you didn't work a lick."
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a'gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues.

Gonna take two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problems
To the United Nations
Well I went to my congressman
He said, quote: "I'd like to help you son,
But you're too young to vote."
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a'gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues.
