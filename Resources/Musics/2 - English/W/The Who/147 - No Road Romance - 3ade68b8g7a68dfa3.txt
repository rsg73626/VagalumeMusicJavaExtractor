NO ROAD ROMANCE

When you look through the lights to the stage, you see the man of your dreams
You think his life's full of parties and love, but it's not what it seems
If you could see in his room right now, you'd see how much love is showed
There's never really any romance on the road

His forehead seems cut in two, by the crease in his brow
He chews his nails as he fidgets, just trying to settle on down
The TV channels keep flippin', his adrenaline slowed
There's never really any romance on the road, oh no

There's never romance on the road, only frustration and overload
He could fall in love, but he'd never know
For she's only riding, and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask, 'cause she won't say no
But there's never really any romance on the road

He was up in the bar straight-backed, did you see him before?
Did he sign you his name, come with me, listen in at his door
Hear himself so drunk calling home, can't remember the code
You know, there's never really any romance on the road, oh no no no

He's held some beautiful girls in his arms, but now he clutches his bunk
For all the good that they're doing him now he might as well be a monk
For his memories ain't worth a thing, 'till he's old and he's gone
And his past never quite catches up, the show's moving on

Did he say he kept a picture of a blonde haired girl who'd been kind
When he was last home his own daughter brought it into his mind
Maybe closing bars and jets, paid some debts that he owed
But there's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road, only frustration and overload
He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed
On stage for an hour, on a laser beam tower
But you know he slept while the neon glowed
There's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road, only frustration and overload
He could fall in love, but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask, but she won't say no
There's never really any romance on the road
