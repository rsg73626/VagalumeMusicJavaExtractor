DANCING IN THE STREET

Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
They'll be dancing
Dancing in the street

This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street
Philadelphia, P. A
Across to Washington D. C. now
Can't forget the Motor City

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street
