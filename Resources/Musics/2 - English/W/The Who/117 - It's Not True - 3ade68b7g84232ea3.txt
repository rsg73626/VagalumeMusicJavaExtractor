IT'S NOT TRUE

It's not true

You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

chorus:
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there

I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

(chorus)

If you hear more rumors
You can just forget them too
Fools start the rumors
None of them are true

(chorus)

You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

(chorus)
