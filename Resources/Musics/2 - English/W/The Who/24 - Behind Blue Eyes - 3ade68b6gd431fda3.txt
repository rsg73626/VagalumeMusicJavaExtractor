BEHIND BLUE EYES

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like, to be hated
To be fated, to telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain or woe, can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me your blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
