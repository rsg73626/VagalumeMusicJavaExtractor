THEY MADE MY DREAM COME TRUE

People died where I performed
People cried when Glass deformed
Shots rang out as the singer yawned
The band played on until the dawn

Lies and drunks and drugs and fools
Tricks and stunts disguise the tools
Was the victim dead, was the blood in pools
Was this not part of show-biz rules?

They made my dream come true
