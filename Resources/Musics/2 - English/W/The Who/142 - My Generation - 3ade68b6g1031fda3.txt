MY GENERATION

People try to put us to down
(talkin' bout' my generation)
Just because we get around
(talkin' bout' my generation)
Things they do look awful cold
(talkin' bout' my generation)
I hope I die before I get old
(talkin bout my generation)

My generation, it's my generation baby

Why don't you all fade away
(talkin bout my generation)
And don't try an' think what we all say
(talkin bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
(talkin bout my generation)
Just talkin 'bout my generation
(talkin bout my generation)

My generation, it's my generation baby

Why don't you all fade away
(talkin bout my generation)
And don't try an' think what we all say
(talkin bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
(talkin bout my generation)
Just talkin bout my generation
(talkin bout my generation)

My generation, it's my generation baby

My, my, my, my generation

People try to put us down
(talkin' bout' my generation)
Just because we get around
(talkin' bout' my generation)
Things they do look awful cold
(talkin' bout' my generation)
I hope I die before I get old
(talkin bout my generation)

My generation, it's my generation baby

Talking 'bout my generation (my generation)
Talking 'bout my generation (my generation)
Talking 'bout my generation (my generation)
Talking 'bout my generation (my generation)
