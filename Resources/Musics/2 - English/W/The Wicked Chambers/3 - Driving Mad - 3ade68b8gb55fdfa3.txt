DRIVING MAD

I´m prepared for the madness to conquer me
I am scared of the hate on my own eyes
Will I dare to blow away his life right now
As I stare at the knife in my hand

Refrain:
Waiting for the madness
To fill my mind with brutal insanity
There´s no time for sadness
But it´s time to die . . .

People lie at the moment they start to speak
I deny to be one of them
I would like to kill every fucking freak
Who today stands in my way

(Refrain)

Chorus:
Fate plays sadistic games with you
You can not deny it´s true
Life is always fooling you
´re driving mad
I don´t need this bullshit anymore
Still I don´t know what I´m living for
All I know is that I´m really driving mad
