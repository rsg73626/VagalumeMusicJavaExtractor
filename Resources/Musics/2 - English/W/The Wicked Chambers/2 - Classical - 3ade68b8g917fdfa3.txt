CLASSICAL

I have waited too long to see that the things won´t change
Delayed it too strong to see when it ends
Hasitated too fast each second I wasted counts
Too soon is too late to start from the end of time
Bridge:
I am dreaming of a life, when time is standing still and age has no name
When each moment lasts until eternaty is mine and always remains

Every minute, each hour, day, week, month and year
Will waylay me lure me to my deadline
No decisions I´m making can be undone
I´m missing the freedom of not being pressed by time
(Bridge)
Refrain:
Bound to spending my life, I give it up for time
Depended on my point of view
Day by day I will pass a point of no return
As long as the time will survive

Chorus:
Ooohh blinded by the life showing me there´s no way to outwit time
Ooohh neverending fight, like a pointless race against the time
Ooohh never got the might to decide about or turn back time
Ooohh yearning for the right to arise and look down on time

(Refrain)
