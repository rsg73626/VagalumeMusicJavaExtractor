FACING WORLDS

A cloudy day was ended, washed away by rain
A thousand useless measures, a thousand trials in vain
Is there any other destination any other aim to gain
Though I know I will never see her smile again

Refrain:
Why is she behaving this confusing way she is?
Why is she caring about me but treating me like this?
Dismissed . . .

A dark night has started silence in my room
Since the moment she deparded, a pale and empty moon
Is there any meaning, is there any sense?
In the way sheÂ´s been treating me today

(Refrain)
Chorus:
All those certain signs, she denied to see
All those written lines, she refused to read
All those spoken words, but she did not agree
Every moment hurts, when she is not with me

(Refrain)
