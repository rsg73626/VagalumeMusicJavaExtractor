BLACK DREAMS

An earsplitting scream disturbing the night
You have just returned from another fight
Only a nightmare but not for you
´cause sooner or later it is coming true
Bridge:
Waiting for the call of the night
Waiting for the pain in your mind
Waiting for your task

Bloody visions in a poisened brain
That cause decisions preventing the pain
Those black dreams will always remain
All he desires is not to suffer in vain
(Bridge)
Refrain:
You´re the child of the night
You´re called from million nightmares
You´re the child of the night
You´re called ' you´re called from here

Night by night when you fall asleep
You´re bein´ called by that howl in the deep
Once you used to just run away
´till you realized that you suffer for me
(Bridge)
(Refrain)
