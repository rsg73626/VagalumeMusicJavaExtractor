LESS BRIGHT EYES, MORE DEICIDE

Take the honest side. 
A gentleman would call it slanderous. 
It takes a man to cry, but I just put a brick through every bird's nest. 

Take me out to the parking lot. 
I'm fine. 
Flattery is dead, romance is next. 
You never wanted to touch me when I was worthless. 
Get it while I'm sick with this. 
White knuckle grip on the world? 
I'm losing it. 
I tried to love you but I hate you all. 
I'm losing it all. 

Dreams are born to die. 
Squeaky wheels are supposed to rust. 
Hate and joy will vaporize. 
The numbers have been crunched. 
Yes, we're all fucked. 

When half of this is real, I'll take lies. 
My fault, you couldn't let me out on my own. 
White knuckle grip on the world? 
Well I'm losing it. 
I tried to love you but I hate you all.
