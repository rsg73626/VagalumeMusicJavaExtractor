AUSTRALIAS

I get up in the morning, eyes swollen shut
Past peak, stale and weak & washed up
That Squid versus the Whale and Cheney's got me
reminiscing on my future lately
So I take it outside. Take down the coffee.
Turn off the lights

I blame you for all of this and that's my fault
Oh, my friend, one hand blames the other one

I'll know when to quit but I'm not yet done

Try to pull the wool over the wolf
Til you can't see the white of my eyes
Your bastard's not so young anymore.

I can't start the menace,
so I'm skipping out on breakfest
Plenty of shit I gotta eat during the weak.
In the case of a catastrophe I will tell you honestly:
I'm most definitely in the weeds
But if you feel like complaining...

Blame me for everything it's all my fault
Oh, my man, one hand blames the other one

I'll know when to stop, but I'm not yet done

Try to pull the wool over the wolf
Til you can't see the white of my eyes
Your bastard's not so young anymore.
You're pouring salt on every wound
With a salt of the earth disguise
Your bastard's not so young anymore (and you know it)

What you throw out won't come back to you.
Why would it?

Put it down. Come back to it. Put it down.

Try to pull the wool over the wolf
Til you can't see the white of my eyes
Your bastard's not so young anymore.
You're pouring salt on every wound
With a salt of the earth disguise
Your bastard's not so young anymore.

Put it down. No time like the next one. Put it down.

Each day the same as the last one
for just another poor sport.
