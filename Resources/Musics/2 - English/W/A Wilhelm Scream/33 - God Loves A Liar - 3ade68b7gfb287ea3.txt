GOD LOVES A LIAR

Don't forget to waste your blood and mix it with your tears now. 
Don't forget to waste your love inside me to crawl out. 
I know it's here inside. 

Why am I so afraid? 
God loves a liar. 

It's turning on me now. 
Accidents are what follows. 
If only you could see her now. 
Don't mistake someone's daughter's crying for fuck sounds. 
For rainy days you're mine. 

Why are we so afraid? 
God loves a liar. 

Today is the day that I laugh for the fun ot it. 
Today is the day that it tears me apart. 
Today is the day I defile your saccharine way, 
or at least take aim. 
Today is the day that I drown for the fun of it. 
Today is the day that I laugh in the dark. 
Today is the day that I see myself for what I really am... 
Dead to the world. 

Liar.
