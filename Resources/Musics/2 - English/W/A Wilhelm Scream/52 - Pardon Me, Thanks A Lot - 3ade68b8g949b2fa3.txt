PARDON ME, THANKS A LOT

blood pressure is headed south
servant becomes the master now
the greediest sons of a bitch alive
they came to bleed our city dry
your ashes are dust to us
born to money and fucked it up
the greediest sons of a bitch alive
won't buy us all

backpedaling and preaching
like you're putting out a fire
you practice your pleasantries
while you're draped over the wire:
pardon me, well thanks a lot

we were coming back to life
but brutus couldn't resist the knife
the greediest sons of a bitch alive
shame on us all

but soon we will expose you
for your ignorance and lust
we'll keep our talking dirty
while we drag you through the mud
we'll vilify your slanderings
while you're under the gun

a most hideous thing, denial
pardon me, thanks a lot
thanks a lot
