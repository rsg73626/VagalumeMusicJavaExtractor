SEND OFF

I tried to wait on the outside.
I'll wait on the outside. One more chance to give me (the choking starts in on me) your affection and your pity.
My actions leave me lonely. My argument's convincing (a song of love and glory) I leave you all without me. I know you wish you did, but just forget it. Sing words like singing prayers. I won't forget that. Watching, watching but it's way too far home. You and I could get up. You and I could get out. Take me home. You and I could get up. You and I could get out.
