WHICH IS WORSE?

I could be selling kids for crack down on the Ave,
and I might listen to gangsta rap,
my bitch I'd slap with my right.
I don't wanna work, you can't make me.
Don't want to be an architect, no.
I'd put a bullet in my brain. I
'd rather be a freeloader, and sit on my ass.
Play asshole with Mr. Bud.
(I need) You're seven digits away.
I need a heroin habit, or a pair of rollerblades.
Could be spending daddy's cash, smoke lots of grass with All Chrome.
Burn my Sting records, write a letter saying "you Suck".
I'm sick of pretending that I give a shit.
Because you're seven digits away.
I need a heroin habit, or a pair of rollerblades.
