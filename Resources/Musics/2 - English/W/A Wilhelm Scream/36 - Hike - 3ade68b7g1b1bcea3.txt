HIKE

Let's go on a rocket ship.
We'll decimate the empty promise makers, including me.
It's old hat for a new life, because they already forgot me.
It's new shoes for a short hike,
that I've been walking for days.
I'm living life like I just died and everybody knows it now.
I'm taking myself for a ride and everybody knows it now.
I broke my legs and tried to fly and everybody knows it now.
I'll tell the truth, why should I lie when everybody knows it now.
