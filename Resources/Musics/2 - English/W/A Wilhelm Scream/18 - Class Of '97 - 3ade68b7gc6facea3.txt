CLASS OF '97

How much more could you ask for?
It's been three years and some change and you're on your way.
But only assholes want to fall in love.
We spent four in that shithole and nostalgia remains.
How about me?
I feel nothing at all.
I feel nothing at all.
And all that's real is really far off.
I don't want to want her,
I just want the chance to see,
because all of my dreams mean shit to others.
I want to go back and fix what's wrong with me.
Life has a way of fucking you up just by being there.
I want to start it over again.
Time stands still while you think of the ones that have forgotten you.
I want to start it over.
I want to start it over,
because all of my dreams mean shit to others.
I want to start it over again.
So, tell me how you are...
