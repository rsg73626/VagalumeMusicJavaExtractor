CONGRATULATIONS

There's a waiting list to the bottom, under you. 
Ex-husbands, romantics and perverts and masochists. 
I'm gonna be there too. 
Where's the stop where the train's gonna hit me? 
True, I live for when you bullshit me. 
Tell me you want me, tell me you need me. 
Undress me with your eyes. 
Lie to me. 

Here we are, in love again. 
Congratulations, 
I'm here as the entertaining fool. 

Must have broke every bone in your wrist, how romantic of you. 
We both got this sickness; goddamn it's addictive. 
It's got me bleeding for two. 
Where's the truck full of bricks here to crush me? 
Don't you fuck with this halo above me. 
Tell me you caught me, tell me I'm sorry. 
Kick me back in your life. 
Torture me.
