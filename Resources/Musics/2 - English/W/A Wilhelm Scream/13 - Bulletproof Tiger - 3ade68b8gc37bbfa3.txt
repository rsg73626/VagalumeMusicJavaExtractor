BULLETPROOF TIGER

Staring down demons, down at Taunton Middle High.
Step-dad was a drunk and every weeknight was a battle.
Rubbing elbows with the morning cattle. Sacrifices.
Getting even with the demons and all their surprises.

I couldn't ask them to leave
I just invited them in.
I can't believe what I just did.
Shoved my face inside my pillow.
Said Hail Mary's 'til I turned purple.

It won't break me down.
Won't leave me paralyzed.
I will spit fire on the pious of the guilty.
That relate but see right through me.
I will spit fire.

I guess you didn't get the note on the nightstand.
(Forgot to read it)
About setting the house on fire.
Somehow a witness to my offense.
Just pissed on the evidence.
Now everybody wants to know where the dog's hiding.

One day I'll cash your death check.
Buy the greatest and the respectable.
That thought had crossed my mind.
Oh yes, that thought had crossed my mind.

I'll take my chances, walking on the wire.
Not smart enough to keep my feet out of the fire.
Where the fear and the pain kept buried alive.
This beast inside metastasizes.
Crawling deeper. Cut wide open. Viciously and without warning.

It won't break me down.
Won't leave me paralyzed.
I will spit fire on the pious of the guilty.
That relate but see right through me
I will spit fire.

When I've given up all I've got.
When my guts are tired in knots.

It won't break me down.
Won't leave me paralyzed.
I will spit fire.

One day I will cash your death check.
Make believers of the impossible.
And I might drop my excesses
The meanest and the unlikeable.
But you won't break me down.
You won't put out the fires that I spit out.
