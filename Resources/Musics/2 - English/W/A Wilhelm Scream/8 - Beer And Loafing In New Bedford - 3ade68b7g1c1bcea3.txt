BEER AND LOAFING IN NEW BEDFORD

Bullshit high school drama with senor Corona.
These are the times that I will never let go.
I know one day my loneliness will show.
When boredom took me over, I said goodbye to summer.
Remember once I went for sociable,
those days are gone and now growing up means growing sick and old.
Am I?
I'm not tired of screwing the friends that I've made,
I'm just tired of being alone.
I'd try to change, but I'd just end up the same, upset and alone.
Life's a pile of shit, only deeper.
Where's that rock star lifestyle for me?
Are winos happier, left to linger?
When will someone else feel bad for me?
