CANCER DREAM

You knew it all, 
Inside your head was graceful. 
You knew suffering was fair. 
Thank you much. 

Do we deserve this type of fate? 
I need this now. 
Do we deserve this type of fate? 

You knew the blood inside my veins was wasteful. 
You knew I was bound to wake up scared. 
I made you up. 

Do we deserve this type of fate? 
I need this now. 
Do we deserve this type of fate? 

Nobody needs nobody, after all.
