ME VS. MORRISSEY IN THE PRETENTIOUSNESS CONTEST (THE LADDER MATCH)

Tell me a doll once came dead from above, 
How'd you lose your way, 
It stole a year from your best ones a waste to ground you. 

When i get to your house, 
Off my back i'll lose the weight, 
When i get to your house, 
Swear to god i won't trust the model or the make 
I will trust you. 
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright 

Tie me up to the radiator 
Trust the sweat, not the face it's on 
Tie me up to the radiator 
Don't put those lights on me 
Don't put those lights on me 

The same doll came to walk over us, 
How'd you lose your way, 
It broke mold got stretched like the weak ones, 
Cracked and dried up slow. 

When i get to your house, 
Off my back i'll lose the weight, 
When i get to your new fake god, 
I wont trust the model or the make 
I will trust you 
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright 

Tie me up to the radiator 
Trust the sweat, not the face it's on 
Tie me up to the radiator 
Don't put those lights on me 
Don't put those lights on me 

Tie me up to the radiator 
Tie me up to the radiator 
Tie me up to the radiator 
Tie me up, tie me up 

Our vanity's a sickness, 
There's a world outside prescribed, 
And i won't live in it.
