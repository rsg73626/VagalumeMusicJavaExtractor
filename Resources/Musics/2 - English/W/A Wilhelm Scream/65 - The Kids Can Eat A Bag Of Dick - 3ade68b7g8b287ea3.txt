THE KIDS CAN EAT A BAG OF DICK

The sudden sight of mirrors brought the hero's demise. 
Hey operator, stop acting civilized. 

I want to be you. 

And the ones to resurrect sex and death bought the copyright. 
They ate shit on the record. Did you get the mix right? 
Not quite. 

I want to be you. 

With a graceful fall did you waste it all? 
I found a way for the rest of you. 
I missed me too. 

Tell me that I'm not so weak. 
Tell me that I'm not alone. 

Fuck me if it pours, you're not built for this. 
But it's not raining is it? 

I want to be you. 

And we've got the rest of our lives to be our fathers. 
What a dream to wet the eyes! 

I want to be you. 

With a graceful fall did you waste it all? 
I found a way for the rest of you. 
I missed me too. 

Tell me that I'm not so weak. 
Tell me that I'm not alone. 

Do I hear you crawling on your back? 
Do I hear you folding up to fear? 
Brave you, I missed me too. 

We Are All We Have.
