YOU KISS THEIR ASS AND THEY SHIT ON YOU

Welcome back to our suffering, and constant letdowns in this crowded world called shit. Tell me, sir, is there something that hasn't been done? It's all fucked up politics. Please don't speak because I can't think less of you. You fuck with us and we'll be fucking you soon. We're in line, a number. Just know we've got yours. We keep our collective futures in the hands of assholes and we're not the only ones. This don't seem right? Because it's fucking wrong. They're gonna screw you and the horse you're on. Don't keep those hopes too long. "Don't get me wrong, we love your songs and all you've done. You're breaking ground, you genius, you. You've done it again! And all will praise you." We don't mind, we love to wait and we'll write more shit and we'll play your game. We're in this for the love you know. We'll always be around. After all this time that we've realized that our love is growing stronger. You can't break us now, we're forever bound to what we love to love now.
