SKID ROCK

Tapping on the casket hands of the irrelevant walking dead.
The heart got beaten, how it bled!
But thank god for nothing.
Suffered a fate much worse than what your mirror shows.
The delusional gaze on the satisfied face of the saddest man I know.

And how success neuters your vileness
Today's Anthrax, tomorrow's Boys II Men.

I used to vomit but it's getting easier now.

It's getting hard to keep it down.

As long as I got friends, I will have enemies in the making.
As long as I got anger, I'll have my downfall.

Behind the attitudes and bullshit clothes.
We lie in silence disbelief of how our hatred grows
Before the hair grew from your neck
and you moved out on your own.
Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.
Disgusted by the set up trends / Puppets selling soda ads
Dressing up like your parents did / Saluted at your own event
Accepted on our own behalf / Shove that award up your ass

We thank god for nothing.

And how success neuters your vileness
Today's Anthrax, tomorrow's Boys II Men.

I used to vomit but it's getting easier now. Scouts honor, it's getting hard to keep down.

As long as I got friends, I will have enemies in the making.
As long as I got anger, I'll have my downfall.
I took my virgin ears to the shed to shred my dignity in the basement.
That was just my style.

That's how it feels to be buried alive.
