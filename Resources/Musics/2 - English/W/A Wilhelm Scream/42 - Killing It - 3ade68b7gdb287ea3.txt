KILLING IT

To lose my words in this smoke filled room, 
If there's a way out, I'm gonna find out. 
As it burns my black eyes red. 

Repress this. 
My only regret: this memory. 
So we can convince them that this is all we are. 
Watch the martyrs when they face the ghosts. 
Shake hands as the waste surrounds you. 

Killing it will only make it stronger. 
Killing it will only help it box you in. 
Killing it will only make you lose your way. 

Shot down the last witness. 
Committed to finish, this is the beginning I can't miss. 
The fucking looks those people gave us. 
No fucking bullets can erase this.
