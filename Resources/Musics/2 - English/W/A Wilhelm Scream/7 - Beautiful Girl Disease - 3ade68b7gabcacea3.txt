BEAUTIFUL GIRL DISEASE

You're gonna make them feel loved.
They'll have an angel where their heart's supposed to be.
You're gonna make them feel alone,
you know you're gonna get to learn to love that responsibility.
When everybody wants to be somebody else,
anybody would stick their neck out for you.
You're gonna make them feel sick.
You're gonna make them throw a noose around their necks.
You're gonna take them for the ride,
you pull it off because you're easy on the heart and the eyes.
When everybody wants to be somebody else,
anybody would do the same, but I didn't yet.
Did she just fuck them for a while?
I wonder if they had known that she belongs to no one now.
I knew that she never would.
Will I wait for her to come around?
I won't now.
I hate myself for making myself bored,
but I'm used to it,
and it beats this race so many ran before,
so I'm used to it.
