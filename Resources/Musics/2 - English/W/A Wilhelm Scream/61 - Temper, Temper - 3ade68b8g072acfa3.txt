TEMPER, TEMPER

You said life was rotten once, but not lately.
I had one similar, but not the same. I miss that old world. (We all might) The one ruled by you.
Hold his hand, warm up your fingers and hold my head back as I choke, because now I can wait. Now I can't wait to shut your voice out; stop it from repeating when you're not here. You never are. I held my temper back once, but not lately. Can I stop myself from exploding? I missed that old world, the one ruled by you. But right now I don't. You held my head back and I choked because now I can't wait. Now I can't fucking wait to shut that voice out. Stop it from repeating when you're not here. You never are.
