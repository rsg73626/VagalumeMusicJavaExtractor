CAREER SUICIDE

Run, motherfucker, Run. 
Will you jump with me through the fire? 
In these dark places evil hosts pad their savings, spent on younger faces   .
It kills me to act surprised, so why don't you just say no? 

If you're mad at the world, no matter, 
As my fake heart concedes to your fake love.
Jump motherfucker, Jump. 
Will you burn with me on the pyre? 

When the fires have died, you gotta lengthen your stride. 
You better run, motherfucker, Run.
