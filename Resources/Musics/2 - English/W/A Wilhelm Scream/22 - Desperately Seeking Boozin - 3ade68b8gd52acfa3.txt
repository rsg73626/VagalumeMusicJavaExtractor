DESPERATELY SEEKING BOOZIN

Friday night we get our checks,
we call Teves and he wakes up Jay.
In the smelly caravan we had the keg sitting there all day. Is the tap broken or did Nuno smoke it?
And what the fuck is up with John C? (He's grumpy!) Where has Nick been lately? He's out being shady and everyone forgot to call Soapy. We keep paging Ricky and you know that Curt's drunk already; he'll be on the floor and then he'll drink a shitload more. Craig brings his black Cave In shirt, Miller Lite and a deck of cards and when the Moose ain't around, Shamus is a football star. You may see Matt and Steve and get a glimpse of Dave Neitz and Eric smokes a dime. Snake might drive by with the Beans by his side and Jarrett's drinking wine. And Trevor has a fit over a Umass girl that has nice tits and Ricky's still not here. It's drama, drugs, dropped shots and beer. When the world bears down, it says get in motion. I've fallen on this love for being lost. When the world's calling and we're not answering, I think that we'll make it after all.
