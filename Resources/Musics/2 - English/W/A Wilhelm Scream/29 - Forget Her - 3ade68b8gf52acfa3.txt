FORGET HER

All those times she dissed you.
All those times she never kissed you when her friends were around.
well i know as well as anyone that sometimes girls can get you down.
You've got to stand up for a reason when she's got you lying on the ground because every so often you'll get a glimpse of me. I'm here, now you're gone. I'm with my friends where I belong. So go on, live your life. iíll play tekken friday night. There's a call from your best friend just when you thought you were alone. Just remember that there's a reason. We've got to show them something. We'll show them what brotherhood's about. Get on your soapbox and shout because every so often youíll get a glimpse of me
