FUN TIME

All day long, I sing this song
And it's driving me insane
All day long, I sing this song
Then I stop and sing it again

I don't know how it begins
I just know it never ends
I feel like singing this song
When I'm singing with my friends

When we're chasing every bottle in the room
Nothing to be embarrassed of
Gonna shout till my voice cuts out
I turn let me in
Why ride of the tracks
I can't relax
I can't hold down

All day long, I sing this song
And it's driving me insane
All day long, I sing this song
Then I stop and sing it again

Nothing to be embarrassed of
Gonna shout till my voice cuts out
I turn let me in
Why ride of the tracks
I can't relax
I can't hold down

I don't know how it begins
I just know it never ends
I feel like singing this song
When I'm drinking with my friends

When we're chasing every bottle in the room
Nothing to be embarrassed of
Gonna shout till my voice cuts out
Nothing to be embarrassed of
I turn let me in
Why ride off the tracks
I can't relax
I can't hold down

When we're chasing every bottle in the room
When we're chasing every bottle in the room
Chasing every bottle in the room

All day long
All day long
