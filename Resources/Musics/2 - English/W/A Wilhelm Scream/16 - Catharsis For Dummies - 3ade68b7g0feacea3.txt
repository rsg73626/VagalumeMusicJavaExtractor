CATHARSIS FOR DUMMIES

I can't tell which lights to go through
You can't want me like I want you
Tell me how you always
Tell me how you always...
Go!

I know when I awake in afternoon
It hurts to be so wrong
Cause drunk turns like to love in fucked up words
We always sleep alone

My ethyl army halts when I do
It stops like heart beats
Who do yours go to?
Tell me how you always..
Can stand here without falling

I know when I awake in afternoon
It hurts to be so wrong
Cause I can only wait for you to call
You'll never sleep alone

When it comes down, it's not easy
When it comes down, it's not easy, yeah
When it comes down, it's not easy
Why can't we stay gone?

Cause you've got a life!

Next time, I won't just speak if I'm spoken to
But it's hard to really want you
When everybody wants you, everybody wants you

It makes me wanna fail,
It makes me ignore you
It makes me wanna want you, anyway
