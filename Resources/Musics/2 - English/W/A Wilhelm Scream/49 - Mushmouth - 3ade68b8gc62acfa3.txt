MUSHMOUTH

It's been some time since
I heard you say "Fuck off, you fucking scumbag, give me my life back and let the dog in on your way out.
" I try to focus on what I want to say, but my four sentence diatribes turn into jumbled lies.
Can't I be like Mush Mouth and bullshit my way through? If only every day could be a day for me and noone else. Can't I do anything to make you want me? Why can't I make plans and be a real man, we'd play Parcheeze like psychopaths. I'm not as stupid or fucked up as you think. I'd be around all the time, but you'd just throw me aside. I'd rather go home alone. It won't be like this for long.
