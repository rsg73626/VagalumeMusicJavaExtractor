THE CHRIST CONSPIRACY

baby jesus went out to save the world, hitched a ride with ol st nick
he said im as real as you, and you're as real as me, do you think the world will ever believe
well if the magics there, and as long as we care we'll live forever using our lists to judge em real good
but they were flying to low and got clipped on a snow peak, made it a week screaming god saves us
but god never came, he said he didnt need to
we'll just give them your names and make up some stories
they'll all still fall for what we planned all along

its blasphemy to write this fuckin song
and you think this is easy, its killing me my family tree has roots wrapped around steeples
i had to face my demons, but what im finding out is everyones demons are themselves tryin to explain pain
i never felt so sane, then when i made that change, you see before i'd cringe at hell when id doubt the diety
in god i still believe, cuz god is me, just me, belief in oneself is what really moves mountains
and you can walk on water or fly like david blane
but trusting in a story with your whole heart will leave you holes
they'll all still fall, the tides still catch the best castles

i had to let it go so i could grow
religions so different yet one in the same, all miss the message love your brother, saved by grace
and never by works, but thats how christians work, righteous judges pulling planks out with blind eyes
you cant say god loves you, then faggotts go to hell, contradiction, cant you see it sorry hypocrite
no your schedules real full, you gotta picket the clinic, be a racist, sexist, homphobic catholic
gods love is like wind, if you feel it then prove it
but santas not real and children still feel him
they'll all still fall because they want to believe
they'll all still fall, not me i wont believe
they'll all still fall because they needs some kinda peace
they'll all still fall over and over and over
