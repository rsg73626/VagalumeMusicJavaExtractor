ELLIOTT'S LAST NOTE

i'm heartless, not to say that i'm cold blooded
i just lost my heart, and now it's getting cold
it just fell like the rain that just started falling today
my words they came out mean
but i swear i didn't mean a thing
for you, i know i'm not good enough
i can't give you what you need
i tried my best to resist the knife but it keeps calling out my name
apology, never meant to be a sad-story kind of boy
my flesh was weak, my heart was numb
a soul, my body came without one
so no one cry, i did enough for anyone in any lifetime
