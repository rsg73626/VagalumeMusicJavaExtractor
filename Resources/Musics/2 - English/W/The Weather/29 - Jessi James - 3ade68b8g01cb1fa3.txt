JESSI JAMES

jessica and james know how to make me feel oh so famous
i havent met them yet, but when i do i'll be like oh my god you guys
kept the weather close and now ill make sure it never rains again
unless you want it to, sometimes the mud puddle are to appreciate the blue
in the sky and the chucks, been wearin them bitches since about 1992
but now im losing track, this song is about that chicago wind
that lifted me up, happy to of met your mirrors in the mail
james listen to me, you never know the best
moments in your life, till you see it behind
but it wont be like that, now you know you'll look for it
and if your losing track constellations fix that
time now is video dream
