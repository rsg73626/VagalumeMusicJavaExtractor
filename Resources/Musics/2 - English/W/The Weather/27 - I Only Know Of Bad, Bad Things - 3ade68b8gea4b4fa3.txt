I ONLY KNOW OF BAD, BAD THINGS

everything i knows about everything that i shouldnt
if you could lend an ear then we could get into it
livin in the basement as a young teenager
gave me access to the night and the world my oyster
before i could drive i would bike through the night
never touch the pavement i was high as a kite
jumpin over fences undressing by the pool
diving in the water man i was so cool
then license time meant we'd never be contained again
i got a new job, 9pm to 5am
im searchin this city like im searchin for a killer
who's on the loose and deserves the noose
im tryin to help him, im tryin to help him escape
