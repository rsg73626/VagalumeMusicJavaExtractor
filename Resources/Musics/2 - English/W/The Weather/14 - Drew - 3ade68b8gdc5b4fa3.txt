DREW

drew i havent spoke to you oh gosh, its been some years
but you dont have to talk back now, this is for your ears
to hear and clear away the tears, hush now, rest now
in the clear light where everything feels right wrapped around you
i got the news in a hotel room at 5am in venice
i dropped the phone then picked it up slo-mo, is it the truth?
my god, i dont know what to say except life is precious
and you drew, you were precious too and worthy, maybe didnt see it
you didnt mean it, the way you left you thought why not the window
cuz that doors so far, stairs so long and bags are heavy as hearts
i remember tyson fight, you, nick and i we lit up the night
or the rock show, woke me up to shave my head, now we were crew
i see you drew in all these memories you're shining right through
and i know your brother knew how much he meant to his baby boy drew
your idol, face lit up when justins name was brought up, we couldnt shut you up
and thats love, you gave it all out and there's plenty now holding you up
and it dont break like heart aches and band aids, precious jewel, drew you are now safe
and ill remember remember the 5th of november the angels surrended a song called "try your new wings on, welcome home baby drew"
