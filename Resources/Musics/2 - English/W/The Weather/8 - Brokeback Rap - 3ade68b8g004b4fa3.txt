BROKEBACK RAP

i thought i came here to wrap burritos but now i'm in the booth rappin speakers
you see i came with the caterers and yeh we brought the tators but because i'm black they think i'm with the pack of hall of famers
so jdiz throws the beat on, turns it up and tells me get on, have some fun, loosen up and get your spit on
but im a first timer, see i like rap but you won't ever see me on a track
i'll tell you what i'm checkin double deckin friekin piece of shit man
im the shit man, for real like a heart attack, dont get caught smackin your wacker round me, im cool with fags but not with their peepees
i like them double digit bitches flippin for the grippin of the coke they gettin out my whip man
have to hold them with a kick stand, lay them out to strip them man, then a taxi for there dip man
cuz they aint my girlfriend i got a boyfriend he rapped before me
sike he just had a crush on me, i told i was straight g, but i won't tell nobody, oh shit, wait is this thing still recording?
i'll tell you what i'm checkin double deckin friekin piece of shit man, im the shit man
