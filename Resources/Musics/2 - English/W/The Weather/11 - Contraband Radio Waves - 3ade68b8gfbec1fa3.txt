CONTRABAND RADIO WAVES

I hold you dear, america
I wont get by, give me some reasons baby
You're holdin back, no straight facin
Im callin you, come out of the closet
I want to see your pretty face
Miss liberty oh my country tis of thee
I wanna love your burnin life
But im out here fightin a good fight of rights
Stop telling me "obey baby,
You mix too much, a hard heart would help you so much"
I wont get by, not day or night
Ive been losing you since the first day that i grew up
You burned with me and the stars and moon
But now we float around past you
