THICK LOVE

when i dont have enough love inside of me to heal you i'd call that a crisis baby, i cant stand to watch you bleed, you beat me so bad into my heart, you're all my needs
cuz heaven is for other people, we were workin so hard so that our love could breathe in, give us something to believe in, and thats rare cuz before i'd only pretend

so when you hear this song and im singing out my lungs, its a badge im holding up sayin "hey we belong"
and i will love you like i took out my own brain and replaced it with a picture framing lovely displays

when im not with you im blue, even if its for a few blocks, i feel so far away babe from the tube i breathe into, keeps me warm and works the pump for my lonely heart
you're like my sun its true, broke my rains in half, in twos, said you swept the clouds away and built us a brand new day, and i appreciate every little thing you do

so when you hear this song and im singing out my lungs, its a badge im holding up sayin "hey we belong"
and i will love you like i took out my own brain and replaced it with a picture framing lovely displays

so just remember what i said when im gone and you're in bed, know you're all thats in my head. and that's till im dead, and then i'll bunk with in your soul double bed

and i know we had our times, couldnt balance out our minds, leaving messages crying sayin "baby im dying"
we bounce back like a bear trap, kiss the skin on your bare back, hit the bed for a rare nap weld tight like an aircraft
its drugs when you stare back, feel it tingle my hair tips, seeing god in your swoll lips, holy visions so catholic
its love that im after and its thick in your laughter, half would last a lifetime, sunshine you are my pastime
