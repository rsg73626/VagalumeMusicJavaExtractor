FALL OVER! FALL'S OVER!

silence is razors, give 'em out enough, you cut, you hurt the situation
you owe it to yourself to speak only the purest, and learn your brain the fullest
you have to rush though patient, preach through generations, bridge the transformation, power to the people
no phony explanations, i'm one person, and we/i aint never gonna quit this shit
