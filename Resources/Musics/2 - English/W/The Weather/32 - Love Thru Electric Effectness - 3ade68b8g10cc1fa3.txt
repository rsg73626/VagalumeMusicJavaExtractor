LOVE THRU ELECTRIC EFFECTNESS

(ray p. and matt b., sound familiar?, love for you and the wait)
when i write a song its not hard to get excited
sometimes it just flows and other times i pry it
out of my heart and into my lungs, out my brain through my hands
dont get me wrong im not sayin they're all heartfelt
but some of them really are and some are hard to tell
but i dont write for anyone anyway and no i dont want to sell it
steal the music steal the lyrics and steal the melodee
steal the rights to my songs and go and flatter me
i accept my life and now i stack my treasures up in heaven
not to say im good im just sayin when you play this much
you're just bound to shit a gold egg
maybe i wont, who knows but hey even simple plan got a deal
but once again this aint for any kind of fame now
its just a little trick to keep my brain sane for now
cuz everyones got their own special way how
james you got to get them words out
(james Q. my blood, thick and true)
its 1982 and im just a baby and you're a baby too
we grow up on the same street but didnt me until 
until it was too late, not sayin it was too late
just wasnt soon enough
i want all of those years, i want your tears
i want our first beers together
i want to sell lemonaide and practice our karate and cannonballs
(and last but not least my baby baby baby)
