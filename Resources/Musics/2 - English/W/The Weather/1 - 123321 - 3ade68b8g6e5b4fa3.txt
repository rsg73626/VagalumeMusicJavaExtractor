lifes a round on a carousel, 
so hold on tight, dont hold
your breath, 
life is too short for debating "what for?"
sooner or later the spin takes its toll, 
you lose your grip, fall of the ride, d
rop like a fly into a dead night
everyone i know has a problem, 
so fake it fast and havea blast, 
worry bout that shit in the morning
lifes a round on a carousel, 
babies get backseats to their parents cars,
oh the 57 chevy
some of the kids take their own cars, 
but real men get cowboy, 
those white stallions flossing gold bars look at them ride now
everyone i know has got a problem, 
so fake it fast and havea blast, 
worry bout that in the morning
