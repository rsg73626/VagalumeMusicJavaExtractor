MY HAIR IS GETTING LONG

my hair is getting long, ball and chain says i need to cut it back down (i wont back down)
but i havent had it this long since middle school and kurt cobain

i need you up around my face, i want you in my place
i asked you today, how bout sometime away (north west)lets go to someplace nice and cold, a place like washington northwest (oregon, washington)
i need you up in my face, i want you all in my place, i breathe you, i dont know what to say, i love you
