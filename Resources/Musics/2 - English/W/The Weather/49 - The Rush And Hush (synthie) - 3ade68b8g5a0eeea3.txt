THE RUSH AND HUSH (SYNTHIE)

hey shorty, hold up, im missin you, its hard sometimes when i dont see you, we ride or die right babe, ride em high in to the night my sweetheart,
we opened up our hearts, it was a good move, i'd say the best move, i told you from the start how i got down, you was down
i taught you my trends, you was in, you was in
you know all of my deepest secrets
its freezing out tonight, im starvin marvin, i need a jacket and a piece of you, winds biting hard tonight, i bite back in fact, take a chunk of cloud and spit it in the moon spitoon
we took a chance on us, we rushed it hushed it, we made a secret, remember how we blushed? cheeks like roses eyes like nervous children,
don't bat an eyelash, your redemption comes in a wine glass, take my oyster heart and get that pearl, cuz i've been grindin sand just for you
