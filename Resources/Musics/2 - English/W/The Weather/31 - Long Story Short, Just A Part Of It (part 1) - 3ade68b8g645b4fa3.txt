LONG STORY SHORT, JUST A PART OF IT (PART 1)

when i first started touchin on these strings, i had punk rock dreams, i was workin on my scream
i really thought id be on tour for weeks, i was putting out shit wasnt getting no hits, but i never let the music die
days were going by and i was wastin most i guess then i got sunny's diary, oh me jesus, 
it showed me i could make people feel things when i sing but id still pop the hell out of it

so i was giving up the 1212 beat, nation state occasionally, retired money tree
punk ideals never cease, still playin for peace, change the world and fuck the nazis
then i started slowing it down but kept the melodee, good riddance themes with woodson eps
deep elm was coookin in my books it really shook man, never mistaken planes for appleseeds

forget lifetime, oh no o o o
