LISTEN TO THIS ONLY IF YOU HATE REPETITIVE SONGS

this songs for a kid eric, i dont know his last name 
he wrote me an email and said most of my songs
are just the same thing over and over again
well i guess thats true, i just like jammin man
i wrap my head around the beat and lyrics start flowin
but you wouldnt know about me just chillin out
everything i knows about everything that i shouldnt
if you could lend an ear then we could get into it
livin in the basement as a young teenager
gave me access to the night and the world my oyster
before i could drive i would bike through the night
never touch the pavement i was high as a kite
jumpin over fences undressing by the pool
diving in the water man i was so cool
then license time meant we'd never be contained again
i got a new job, 9pm to 5am
im searchin this city like im searchin for a killer
who's on the loose and deserves the noose
im tryin to help him, im tryin to help him escape
hows that for over and over, i love you eric
