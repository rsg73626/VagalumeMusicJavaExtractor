I GUESS THIS ISN'T GROWING UP

little babies cry without their way
grown babies act half their age
20-something screaming like a 20 month old
pobre cita, tu es muy lastimoso
cry baby, cry. i guess you think life works that way
sad baby, you're sad, did you learn nothing from those 2-bit years
facts are facts, cant argue with that
emotion will never win the debate
just because you say something at the top of your lungs only proves you're young, wrong is still wrong
cry baby, cry, try to prove a point, get someone on your side
sad baby, you're sad, try to get some ground with a pouting sound and frown
laugh baby, i laugh, in fact we both laughed, its kinda hard not to
wrong baby, you were wrong but there is still time
to change your diaper
to take your bib off
to think for yourself
and to grow up
