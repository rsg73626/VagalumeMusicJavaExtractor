BE FREE, AND BE HAPPY

happy and free, what else could we need
no place to be, where should we start tonight
backs facing east, my heart left long before i did
we're breaking knees, run so fast we can't keep up
oh if you could please, watch over me as i watch you
then it'd be real peachy, lookin after another

we'll run away from nothing chasing us just to feel like a kid again its what we want
to be anonymous, with no one callin us, before i needed insurance on my life
its so strange to us to have to play adults, time took my life and left me in the dust

keep my nose clean, and i'll be sure to brush your teeth
give me no grief, that's for all the old folks we meet
be sure to release, all that energy inside
plenty of sleep, for all our lazy friends who died
drink a forty, up and down the railroad tracks

before i leave, got to tell you one more thing
try not to breathe
will we see peace?
oh try not to breathe
