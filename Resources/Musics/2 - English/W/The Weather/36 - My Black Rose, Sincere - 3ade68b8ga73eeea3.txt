MY BLACK ROSE, SINCERE

this song is for my black rose, my dear Sincere
there has been some confusion about this, i got to clean the mirror
the way you died broke my mind, i wonder if you mind these simple
songs
our plans would fucking cross themselves, you said just forget it, i said remember when i said,
"if we cannot stop the bullets shooting holes up in the sky, then it is going to rain, Sincere, forever. and you will wonder why?"
but now i am praying heavens real, not that i would ever get in, but it is the only place you deserve to be
because im somewhere between the bottom, and i keep on dropping, far more than often, if i could just stop and live happy
it would have made your life real easy, but my ideals were sharp and they were cutting up your leg, you were bashing in my face saying, "Love you baby!"
and i love you, baby you were bleeding to death, i was tearing at your flesh, just trying to do my best at a rescue attempt
and i took your life, slowly but surely, bloody and messy, i can't not confess this, you were my best
