RAINISH

the devil's been haunting my dreams again, and he's always leaving dirty footprints
his 2nd stop left me feeling hot, he stepped 'this is the end' in sand with his sandals
i try to wake up sometimes to make it end, but he feeds me a valium and says "just watch this"
then he puts my life movie on, fast forwards to yesterday, then he says
"you fit into polished society like a puzzle piece, a brain on a leash
your attitude is gettin you thru the door, your bullshit' n handshakes, suckle from the big man
scrapin together all the money you can stand to just spend it on fire, burnables and flammables
