THE LOVE TEST

if you're not here now, then i might as well 
fake my death no other day
i'll walk in my funeral, disguised as someone else
and see what you people got to say
cuz im going to hell, just got to know first
with me dead will you be off the curse
you say i put you in, that's just your opinion
i know i gave you the best that i had
it seems you're doing fine, maybe you were right
the worlds a better place without my face
im doing it for real, here it goes again
this time the knife won't miss
