WHAT'S WITH THE WEATHER

the tempatures changin in my town, its mid january and car tops are comin down. me of course, live with no windows in, rocks hit my knuckles and they scratch through the skin
oh mr weatherman tell me bout the heat wave thats blowin through my town today, rocks to knuckles and im bleeding on the freeway, oh my god what a lovely day
my ideal weather would have to be a little bit of snow mixed with a little heat. i know it doesnt make sense but thats me, just like my favorite colors would have to be black and blood
sunday yeh it'll be a little cloudy, monday its the start of the heat wave, tuesday gonna drive until your empty, wednesday got to get some gas money, thrursday gonna get a little cloudy/chilly, friday gonna rain alot today, saturday i hope you enjoyed the heat wave
