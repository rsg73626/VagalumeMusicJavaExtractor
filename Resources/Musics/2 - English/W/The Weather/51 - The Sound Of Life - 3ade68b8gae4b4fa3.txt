THE SOUND OF LIFE

the sound of life goes boom boom doom
keep up with the beat and you'll be done done soon
cuz what you're going thru now 
seems like you don't know how you'll ever make it out
but you will they say just cant see it today
just take a half step at midnight
and another tommorrow
you always out of your bad bad dreams
but sometimes it will seem you died in the dream
or at least on the insides, cuz they aint workin right
time is a doctor, he'll heal your pain
and put you to sleep when you need the grave
just know this while you fantasize extinction
i got your back for good and that requires no thinking
where ever you go or dont, it will be the same
when you see me again, blood tride and true
