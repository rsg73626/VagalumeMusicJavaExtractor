CADENCE' FATHER

christmas once again and im wasted, 
when your life hasnt gone
quite where you expected it, 
its easier to kill than care,
im not one for caring now so 
i guess ill do some killing. 
tell the familys to piss off, 
i could do without them, 
i could do without anyone. 
its ok get a good look, 
stare close at the failure, 
you'll be this way one day if you dont look out,
you had better get in their club quick, 
dont waste time cuz its so exclusive, 
i told you to come by when i know you'll never know why
