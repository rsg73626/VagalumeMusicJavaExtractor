TERROR IN FREEDOM

I've seen you forward but never backwards, is your pride heavier than 21 grams plus a million, save your speech for the one unjaded
now youve got us all tapped in wire traps, guess were all prime suspects, the terrorist plot got our country locked up in fear
i fear the terror in freedom, i feel your terror freedom, i feel a terrible freedom
guess what we got? blackwater cops, rockets poppin, loppin heads off, all private contracts, dont expect a call back, for some justice for the innocent
no court marshal, no tribunal, no background check, felony, anger, ok, got bad cops policing bad cops, boy throws a rock and kill em 50 bullets shot, boy sets fire catchin hell out the flame thrower
so what are you changing? what are you shooting for? get a foothole then the oil starts to roll, is it all worth it if you have to curse it, dogs on no leash biting holes in humanity
your legacy will tell it, you started fast and fell in, so much blood on your hands that it cant be covered, if you are for liberty then fuck the federal id 
microchip us next so they can keep us in their nexus
