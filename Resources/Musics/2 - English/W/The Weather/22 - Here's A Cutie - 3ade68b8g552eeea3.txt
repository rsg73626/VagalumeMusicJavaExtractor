HERE'S A CUTIE

i know you think that i dont love you that much
but thats in your head and you might be crazy
oh but in my bed, yours songs next to my head
so here is one song to keep you calm while we get married
you see its always been something like that
your away, my minds astray, yeh thats what you're thinking
believe me when i tell you im dreaming of you, of blue stars to I'm singing
maybe one day i'll finally say everything i cant make words for, but its there, i cant even explain it.
what if i said maybe its better to stay. well maybe you'll know what i've been trying to take/say
you see its always been something like that
your away, my minds astray, yeh thats what you're thinking
believe me when i tell you im dreaming of you, of blue stars to I'm singing
