H STANDS FOR HARDCORE/JONNY DOING CASH/FREE SPENCER BURNS

i got a little friend, he's doin 5 to 10
in virginia state pen, they got him locked in a pin
he was fuckin with the law, the judge had the last straw
he said "boy you better quit fuckin around or you'll be back again"
well spencer didnt like that sound
so he put his hits out from the pound
he said do the judge first, i want his ass in a hearse
drop cloths around the scene, then we clapped him up clean
took all the cash out from his crib, then we thru him in a pit
a lesson, you'll mess around with hardcore only once my friend
then we moved to the d.a., they had alot of things to say
before the bullets in the brains, make 'em feel no more pain
now spencer's smiling from his cell
now he can make it thru the day
without them problems outside
i think i'll stay for life
the lesson, you'll mess around with hardcore only once my friend
