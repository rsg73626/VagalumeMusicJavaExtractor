TWIST KIDS

We see nothing wrong with you maybe its all in your head,
It gitcha,
Gotcha goin crazy
You feel the weight of the world and you try and balance on ground so soft with tears you slip right down the mountain
One slip need to be caught beneath the tree of memories so deep they're holding up your feet
When thoughts start spinning round and you can't stop it, you know loves more than that rocket in your pocket

You feel like you gotta show all the world to sit back and watch the sun from up to down
Relax and think about that old fashioned feeling,
Tongue twist kiss kids kick start their sex for healing
So maybe if we could just pause our first kiss,
There'd be no war no more,
We'd want to share our breakfast
And thats the love we need to give out to the strangers, make them soften up and forget about their anger
We see nothing wrong with your baby,
Go ahead and have her on the table
