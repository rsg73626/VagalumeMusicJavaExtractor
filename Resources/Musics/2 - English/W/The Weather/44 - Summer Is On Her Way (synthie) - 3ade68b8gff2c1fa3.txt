SUMMER IS ON HER WAY (SYNTHIE)

you know about me, you did yourself some history
well ima tell you right now a story thats been brewin and stewin, its called not being scared
everything you see is what you get from me is my line for my family and friends that ask why
whats with sobbin all the time, you're cryin like a baby on the microphone, its so disgusting
i cant control the chords my hands happen to pick for my fingertips, let alone inkin
my life is just a freestyle and no it never takes too long, but when you could just try everything
and i know its coming from right now and its got me in it

this music is my tattoos on the world, its stapled in time and space, i said i was inkin
theres not too many things i know for sure except you oughta be good, dont get caught stealin
help each other if you can, always lend your healthy hands to stranger, you dont need a reason
and find a god and stick with him, dont forget about the end, or pretend or believe we'll see
cuz i believe all you see of me is just a shadow puppet, i got things inside, oh my god you wont believe, and so does everyone including you, just got to break on thru to the other slide
