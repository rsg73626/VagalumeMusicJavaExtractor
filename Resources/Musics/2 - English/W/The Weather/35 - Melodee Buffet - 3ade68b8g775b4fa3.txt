MELODEE BUFFET

i hope you're all hungry
i hope you came hungry
to my buffet of melodee
the music is the bread
and the lyrics are the meat, passion cooked to heat them
chew it in your brain and let them seep in
i'll try to keep it good for you
ill try to make it pure for you
i take pride in what i sing for you
and i take responsibility
cuz when i sing i want to move that mechanism in your brain
that makes you want to do the good good things
im not trying to be better
better than anyone
just trying to be average
just an average joe
who carves his name in the tree of life
in a heart shaped spot next to my wife
cuz when it's all over
death puts me in her covers
i'll still be waving goodbye
with my arm out thru the speaker
cuz death can't kill the ideas i left behind
the weather, the diary of my life
ideas are life not yet held outside
you got to make them count, you got to take them out
with the trash to create a slideshow
to where you want to go
there aint no mistaken
its half a block and then a left before you break em up fine
it doesnt always work out
how we planned
so we got to make do
got to make do with what you got in your hands
it's real when you squeeze it
