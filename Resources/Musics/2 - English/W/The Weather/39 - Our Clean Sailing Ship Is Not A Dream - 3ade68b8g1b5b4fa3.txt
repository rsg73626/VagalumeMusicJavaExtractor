OUR CLEAN SAILING SHIP IS NOT A DREAM

theres a hole in my heart and it hurts when i breathe like that hole in a tooth, you dig?
cuz i cant make peace with the angels and demons, theyre waging a 20 year war
and one keeps on pushin and one keeps on pullin, im stuck in an awful bind
so if you could lend me your scissors then maybe i could cut my body in half
and i can cure everything, my songs cure me quick, slick doc on the microphone

actions speak louder than words so im workin on keeping my attitude clean
and i got a book from a buddhist, i use it, compassion kills anger so clean
i really believe what im telling these teens and if you see me in public youd see
that i would be willing to give you the shirt off my back or a ride or tea
and im not just showing off, im going to leave the world a better place than what i got

we can patch our broken wings, our broken dreams they dont seem so bad anymore
we can fix our broken dreams, our broken wings they seem like they could fly some more

so i write some songs about death, sex, and drugs, little anger and lots of love
cuz i wanna make it so you can relate it to your life cuz this is mine
and we aint much different, cuz we all just humans, the truth we are all family
so listen my brothers and listen my sisters take are of another to see
that we can make make-believe into reality, i swear we'll see that ship sailin clean
