I'VE BEEN LYING TO YOU

not fiction but not the truth
is how i got to talk to you
be careful cuz words can weigh
more than meanings on how you take 'em

cuz if i gave you everything i got
it'd level you flat, have to scrape you off the pavement
its hard enough just keepin it inside
why do you think i'm sick all the time?

cuz i scare myself sometimes, oh jonny why you got to be that way
cuz i scare myself sometimes, oh jonny just say what you got to say

not fiction but not the truth
is how i tone it down for you
cuz i dont need the feds after me
for sayin shit i didnt mean

you know the weather, no you don't
half my shit goes straight to the vault
the other half are the songs you hear
havent been honest, just wanna make that clear

cuz i scare myself sometimes, oh jonny why you got to be so sick
oh jonny don't scare me, but oh jonny lets all see that brain
