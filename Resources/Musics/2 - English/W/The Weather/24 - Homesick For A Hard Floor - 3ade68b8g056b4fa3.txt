HOMESICK FOR A HARD FLOOR

bonds break, 
but steel bends and now i feel my sin was leaving and all my old problems are just little marbles
cuz when you work to eat you see theres bigger things that need me, 
and need you and yeh were tired but so is everyone
but still we manage to say please and thank you, 
and good job, you got it, we can do it if we all do it together
2nd harvest is coming, 
run on 2 cups of caffeine, 
but my team is strong, 
plus we got the light so well be alright
i miss josh, and luke, 
most i think, 
prolly cuz they are who i want to be, 
we all wish we could be but we cant sacrifice our tv
but that since that drugs left quite a sting, 
i workin hard to arrange things, 
and what will be we will see who knows maybe permanently
im goddamn home sick for a tent and a hard floor
