GOD DON'T CALL MUCH ANYMORE

if you want to find me, just go thru my songs
there is nothing behind it, just mixed in twisted
cuz this is my real life, i got nothing to hide
besides its not always easy living out lies
god doesnt ask me for much anymore
since i showed him the door
i just needed him out of the room
so i could clear my throat
