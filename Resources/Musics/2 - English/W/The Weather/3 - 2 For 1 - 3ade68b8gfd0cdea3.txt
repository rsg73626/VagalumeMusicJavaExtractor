2 FOR 1

1st song:
if you want to understand what's inside of me
if you could try and make something better of yourself then do it, 
go through, 
come on baby it's a reaction. 
if your getting old inside, 
just try and be alive, 
you got to do what got to do, 
try and test me, 
go and push my buttons oh baby. 
if you could see my point of veiw maybe you'd like it. 
i just wanna move, 
i just wanna be poor and i dont want anyone to know where
if you really love me then you should try and understand what i'm trying to do

2nd song:
hey angel, 
i can make my voice sound pretty. 
and you can stay for awhile tonight.
please dont ask me for something i'm not willing to give
