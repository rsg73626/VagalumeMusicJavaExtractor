EVERLASTING LOVE

thinking, what am i, oh yes im off to bed to rest my heavy head
feeling, out of touch, i thought about my range and how i need less
breathe in, almost done, i bet the clouds are soft as shit to lay and sit on
acting, like i know it all, yeh sure you came to grip, you got your soul in check now
wishing, i could settle down with idea, it'd all be clear, and i'd live sound
everlasting love is what im shooting for
