THE SHADOW DID ME IN

this was part of a live show/performance i did for an artist representation company in california 

one day i was walking through the ghost town when another shadow appeared on the ground, i stopped in my tracks and went to turn around and a sharp voice rang out "you turn back around"
so i kept on walking with the shadow on my heels trying to catch a glimpse through the broken window sills, i got to the end of town and whispered "what now?" and the voice said "boy i'll tell you what now"
the man grabbed my hand and stood face to face, his eyes were hollow and he had an elegant trunk, he said "reach in the bag" as he brought my hand down, said "go and feel around and pick your crown"
while i was reaching in the bag i said "hey whats that thing in your other hand" he said"oh just a pitch fork to keeps the ghost in line, how you think a town like this stays so nice"
well i picked out my crown it was gold and white, he said" an excellent choice to die in tonight" i said "whats all this about dying" he laughed in my face and said "put the crown on your head"
well i picked out my crown it was gold and white, he said" an excellent choice to die in tonight" i said "whats all this about dying" he laughed "boy once you come you cant never go back"
