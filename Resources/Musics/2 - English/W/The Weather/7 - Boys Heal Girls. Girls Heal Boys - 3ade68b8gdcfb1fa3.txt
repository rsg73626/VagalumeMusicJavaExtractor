BOYS HEAL GIRLS. GIRLS HEAL BOYS

little boys go out and play, littles girls stay away from boys who play too rough. don't be afraid just keep your distance from those bad boys
they ride too fast plus they take off their brakes, flying thru life no gret for safet's sake. if one ever stops and talks to you just run-a-way
but just a warning one day you'll meet a boy and he'll run after you while you're trying to avoid him. but he won't give up and you'll tire down, he'll slow everything around down and say,
"hold me, oh baby you can break both my arms, i mean really squeeze me like the heat on a summer's night
breathe me, cause you're breathing for me now
and please heal me, cause i know that i could just heal you and maybe you could just heal me
