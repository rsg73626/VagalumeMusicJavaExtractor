16 YEARS OLD

why try even once more, like the things you told me before on the floor but how could i walk away from you when i never could before, time to pass away my judgements i miss you
its been awhile since i wrote a song for you
and i miss the sideways smiley coming thru the glass
and the way you make summer fun indoors
the way i drove down your street
the black of night, the windows down
the music up dreams of you in the passenger seat
having me sing "i'll stop the world and melt with you"
over and over and over again until you think yeh that im real cool, but im really not, so anyway
