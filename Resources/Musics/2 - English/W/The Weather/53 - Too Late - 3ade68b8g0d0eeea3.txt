TOO LATE

i live life like a fat king on the outside
but on the insides im dying, im starving, a peasent eating shit
its so easy to float, but hard to swim
and goals dont come easy, and moneys still paper
i only get self-conscious while on amphetamines
if you take away my demons, i'll show you my angel
i lust after the luster left in the vast air
boy and i can see it all now, regrets equal misplaced choices
its so easy to choke when you want to die that bad
does heaven take give-ups? "not this time of year"
you'd better wait till summer, maybe a cloud will clear
then life could be better, i wish i could of told you this
where did you go charlie brownstone
where did you go uncle eli
