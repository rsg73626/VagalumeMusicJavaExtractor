THE BIG PICTURE

heaven doesnt wait for long, it something you got to hold when young, try not to lose it cuz once its gone, what the hell is this fresh hell?
i cant stop time its so so slick, the way it tocks and tick tick ticks, it makes me so sick sick sick watching life slip away
i remember a day when time stood still watching icicles from the window sill, dreaming one day i'll have the world, well i got it and you can have it back

now i got to worry about corrupt goverment and closing costs, my fathers health and takin wyl out, make sure to fill that bank account
jonny you got to have money, cuz without it there'd be no leash, no ties to a life you'd no doubt leave if free, but you're chained to loudoun county
i know you dont like the sound of that, you spend too much time in kerouac, daydreams dont weigh anything jack, one lived it, one read it, thats that

so what am i to do with life? well have some kids and love your wife, do your best to not cause strife, i'd call your world a perfect life
try not to think too much on past, the wish i could and wish i hads only add to no relax, take time to smell the roses man
cuz biting your time and nails is bad, so live life like todays your last, love everyone you can so bad and never stop the music man
