HIGH HORSE

the best summer i had was when i met her at the fair the animals were everywhere the fireworks were fillin the air with smoke, and so we smoked
we held hands on the ferriswheel and when we got real high i thought i'd try and steal a kiss from you and taste your soul inside and i'd let you lick mine
cuz right now it feels like everything that's criminal would be ok to try with you by my side
so she loaded up all her junk and showed me how to register, jumpin on the plunger, she changed my life forever
and of course you know this aint no every day thing, she told me a hundred times and i forgot the next day
she explained in detail and i still copped the next day
now i never see her much anymore but i still keep in touch with her buddy
