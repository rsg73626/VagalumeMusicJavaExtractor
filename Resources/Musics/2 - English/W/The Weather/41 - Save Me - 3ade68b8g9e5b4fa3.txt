SAVE ME

i'll reach around the world for you, 
i'd try and find ideas to use to cool out all the nervousness i get from when i think of you, 
if i could just apply for you and get my scores real high i'd prove i'm just the kind of guy for you, 
it's true
so come on, come on baby lets get out of here lets get laid underneath the shade we'll crawl away and have each other for the day away, 
a lifetime away together
so come on come on baby we're rolling down the river tonight, 
left our cares out of sight because we're still alive and it's about time we did something about it
