DREAMACHINE

cut up our lives and scatter all that matter
what do you see in the light with your closed eyes
a billion different lives sliced, diced twice
just keep looking through the light and first off
how many people you know do the dreamachine
so i know what i mean when i talk of these things
i put in my hours, started with shapes and flowers
i went through a tunnel and i saw my death

when the record starts to turn, sets fire to the engine yeh its starting to burn
i think i'd better keep my feet, go explore and do my best oh not to think
i got to unfocus my life, find a better one waiting behind the sun
everything is possible in heaven's light
anyone is anyone in that flashing circle
theres no such thing as real, pick your favorite color
let the picture come to you, let your mind out
