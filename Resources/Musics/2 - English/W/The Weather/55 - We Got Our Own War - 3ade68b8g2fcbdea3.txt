WE GOT OUR OWN WAR

if i could right all my wrongs with one song, this would be it
kids never know what they want to do, so they do drugs and drink and drive too
but dont worry momma, theyll be ok
because when youre growing up its all about the future
learning from mistakes, bandages and sutures
but when get future, youre gonna want past
see the 60's werent so cool for our parents
but we look back in aww, cuz that eras a legend
but hey kids! theres a war going on now
so maybe we are really all like our parents,
were making up history, just not apparent
but will your names be taught in a class?
see these moments right now are seeds and time is water
so plant something good or please just dont bother
we got enough thorns, we need flowers
because the presidents a prick and that comes from thorns
and if he really cared then what about darfur?
"because not on my watch, will you ever feel safe,
not on my watch will there ever be peace"
the problems of the world are not al queida, not niggers, spics, honkies, kikes, or towelheads
its not about flags or fags,
just love one another
cuz see there is no such thing as color in your skin,
its color in your heart that tints your eye-lens
so close your eyes, and now see clear my child
and dont let the news hardin' up your insides
because the worlds beautiful no matter who died
whats a thousand gangs when you got a million stars?
