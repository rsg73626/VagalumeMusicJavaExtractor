DOCTOR MOM PRESCRIBES MORPHINE FOR HEART-ACHE

feeling that death creeping back up my shoulders, it started with stress and i have no one i could cry with
im locked in myself and its tight and kinda hard to breathe, theres no kinda key to free me from my cell built in hell
now im back on the drugs, the only way to forget there is not enough love to keep me away from the drugs
its a circle i'll lose, and im anticipating the day i make my escape and be free from this so cold world

having enough is never enough until you've had enough of searching for something to make you feel normal again, say everything will be ok
having enough is never enough until you've had enough, im so sick of searching for something to make me feel normal again, i say i cant stand to see another day

its hurting my brain to try and deal with the feelings that are eating up my heart and my family's legs are falling apart
we used to be so strong but hey who really loves that long, 26 years i guess we're lucky she stayed that long
and i fear i can never please the ring, we both said forever but what if she change and say no more can i take
i cant do the things i did before and now i gotta quit our team, nice dream while it lasted

having enough is never enough until you've had enough of searching for something to make you feel normal again, say everything will be ok
