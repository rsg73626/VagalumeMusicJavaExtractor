OCTOBER 17TH

baby i may get a little crazy sometimes maybe all the time
i can't help it, 
i'm just a little afraid of the world, 
sometimes its pretty ugly
i cant help it, 
no one seems to
i feel helpless with people dying
if we could we should you see, 
would you want to help with me?
lets chase the land, 
find our way home somewhere else
baby lets get it straight love will pull us through right, somehow its got to
so lets see what we can do, 
pack our chutes with a rocket on the moon and
lets fly up and out of here and out past there and over those hills yeh
people calling, 
we're not there, 
theyll stop calling, 
everybody won't care
lets chase the land, 
find our way home somewhere else
lets chase the land, 
we'll eat each other to survive
my turn, 
your point of view, 
you say baby i want to make a little nest here
lets get this and put that in order, 
why does it matter, 
we can afford it
i want the american nightmare, 
you used to, 
what happened to you?
lets plant our roots, 
its about time you hang up your boots
lets chase the land, 
find our way home somewhere else
