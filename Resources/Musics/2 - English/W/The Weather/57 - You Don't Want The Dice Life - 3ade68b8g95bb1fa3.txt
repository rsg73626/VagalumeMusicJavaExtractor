YOU DON'T WANT THE DICE LIFE

lets take our skin off, lets get inside our insides, dont mind the mess i dont clean that much anymore
see here my soul, the problem i told you about, lost box of tarnish anyway im growing on the wear
it seems i got a rare case of epileptic knots, tied up in my heart, i dream about blood and love everynight
its getting clear, my purpose, what im to do here, relief to you if you only knew but ill never tell
i'll give you one thing, there is no heaven and hell
is when there's no more groceries on the shelves
life is that simple, its no big mystery
but dont go trying to figure it out like me, that is unless you want a die with me
that's if you want a die with me
