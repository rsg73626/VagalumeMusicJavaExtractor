1964

I´ll tell you something jack
You don´t know the real deal
What comes around may still go around
And that´s just how i feel

Better hear something jack
Life´s a piece of shit you know
Whenever you expect something of it
It turns out a horror show

Those were the best days of our lives
Were never real, and never right

Then you come around
And you´re not waiting much
But this is it my dear
You better hold a punch
Oh god you come like this
Just while she acts like that
And i say

Maybe you´ll wake up again
In 1964
We´ll be holding flowers in our hand
In 1964
