SAVE MY SOUL

Save my soul.
I'm digging holes.
We keep control.
But it's slow motion.

I play the fool.
Don't play too cool.
There are no rules.
But I'm still in school.

Save my soul.

Sweet riding.
My best laid things.
I'm outgrowing my favorite ring.

I don't like phones,
But stay on hold.
We've come so far,
Can't hang up now.

Save my soul.

Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
Save my soul.
