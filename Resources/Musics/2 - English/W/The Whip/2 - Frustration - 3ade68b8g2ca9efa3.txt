FRUSTRATION

Frustration is coming in
Frustration is over me
The spirals are guiding me down
But a new deck has issued this hand

Looking to doors that are fading
Suspended by hinges that lie
Taking away expectations
Giving the best that I can

Let it go
Everything you said I'd know
Let it go
Everything you said I'd know
As I feel dust all around me
Every time I close my eyes

Frustration is coming in
Frustration is driving me
Desire it carries me on
My exile has come and has gone

?essly clenching my fist I
I'm taking the paths that still count
Washing the walls we have painted
Applying myself when you call

Let it go
Everything you said I'd know
Let it go
Everything you said I'd know
Let it go
Everything you said I'd know
Let it go
Everything you said I'd know
As I feel dust all around me
Every time I close my eyes

It's cold outside
And it's later than you think
It's cold outside
And it's later than you think
It's cold outside
And it's later than you think
It's cold outside
And it's later than you think

It's cold outside
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
It's cold outside

Let it go
