DUBSEX

Underground the heat is rising
Casualties in need of hiding
Charity for cable dreamers
Every victim has the reasons

Open arms to come sit out of sight(?)
Just leech(?) it I've made heading for the light (the light)

Can you hear me underground?
Can you hear me underground?
Are you listening underground?
Electricity we need

Can you hear me underground?
Can you hear me underground?
We're surviving underground
In the hope of the start and the end

Footsteps(?) at my feet go forward
Future(?) tears you claim no reward
Left for dead and(?)
No great hurry
?? no longer a worry

Things are back to making more sense
To win or lose is no consequence

Can you hear me underground?
Can you hear me underground?
Are you listening underground?
Electricity we need

Can you hear me underground?
Can you hear me underground?
We're surviving underground
In the hope of the start and the end

Things are alright, we pretend
