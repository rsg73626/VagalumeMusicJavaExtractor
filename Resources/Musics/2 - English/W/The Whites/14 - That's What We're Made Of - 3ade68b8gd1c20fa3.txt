THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MADE OF

Troubled times when love's at stake the weakest of affairs will break
Stronger hearts a true love make that won't fall apart
Bonded by the ties that bind we can stand the test of time
Like diamonds in the dust of life that's what we're made of

We lay the groundwork stone by stone a wall of love can stand alone
Even when the ragin storms roll in
We have trust like an iron will faith as strong as solid steel
Invincible that's how we feel that's what we're made of

 We lay the groundwork stone by stone a wall of love can stand alone
Even when the raginf storms roll in
A fortess made of flesh and blood build upon the rock of love
And I thank the Lord above that's what we're made of
That's what we're made of that's what we're made of
