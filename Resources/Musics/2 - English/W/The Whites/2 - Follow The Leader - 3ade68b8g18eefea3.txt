FOLLOW THE LEADER

Follow follow come on let's follow the leader

Are you standing at the crossroads searching wondering just which way to go
Are chasing around in circles tossed by every angry wind that blows
There's a plain and a simple solution Lord just lift your head up follow the sun
Don't look to the left or right keep your eyes upon the light
If you ever expect to get to the other side

You got to follow follow the leader
He's traveled every road and he already knows the way
He's forged every river climbed every mountain
Walked on the water held back the rolling tide
You got to follow follow the leader
If you ever expect to get to the other side

 It's so easy to take the wrong road many a traveler has gone astray
Caught in a whirlwind along life's highway never heeding the signs along the way
There's a roadmap and simple directions
Lord take some time to help a traveler passing by
There'll be a few hills to climb pass with care and take your time
If you ever expect to get to the other side

You got to follow follow the leader...
You got to follow follow follow follow the leader
