WHEN THE NEW WEARS OFF OF YOUR LOVE

When the new wears off of our love
When the new wears off of our love
We'll be closer together still loving each other
When the new wears off of our love

We will still say I love you every day
With a kiss in the same sweet loving way
Just a little bit more than yesterday
When the new wears off of our love

When the new wears off of our love...

 When the new wears off of our love...
