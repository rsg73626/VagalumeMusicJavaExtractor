YOU PUT THE BLUE IN ME

I was alone when you found me nothing but grey skies around me
But with you I found a rainbow in the rain
Safe in your arms I discovered there was a world so full of color
But I never found the blue till you went away

You put the gold in the morning sunlight
You put the green in the willow tree
You put the red in the summer roses but you put the blue in me
You put the blue in me

[ dobro ]
 I've got a blue sky above me to remind me that you loved me
And the mem'ry of your blue eyes still remains
And there's a blue teardrop staining the picture that you painted
And now my whole world has taken a different shade

You put the gold in the morning sunlight
You put the green in the willow tree
You put the red in the summer roses but you put the blue in me
You put the gold in the morning sunlight
You put the green in the willow tree
You put the red in the summer roses but you put the blue in me
You put the blue in me

You put the gold in the morning sunlight...
You put the gold in the morning sunlight...
