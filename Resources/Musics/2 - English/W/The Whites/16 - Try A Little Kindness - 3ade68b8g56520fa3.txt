TRY A LITTLE KINDNESS

If you see your brother standing by the road
With a heavy load from the seeds he sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way
Just stop and say you're going the wrong way

You've gotta try a little kindness show a little kindness
Shine your light for everyone to see
And if you'll try a little kindness you can overlook the blindness
Of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets

[ piano - dobro ]
 Don't walk around the down and out
Lend a helping hand instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day
Will help someone along their way

You've gotta try a little kindness...
Of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets
