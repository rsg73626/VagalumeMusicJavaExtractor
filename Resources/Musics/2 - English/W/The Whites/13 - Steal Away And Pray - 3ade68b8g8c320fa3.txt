STEAL AWAY AND PRAY

Every time I do a deed I shouldn't do
Every time I say a word I shouldn't say
Let me tell you what I'd do it will bring a blessing too
I just steal away somewhere and pray

I just steel away I just steal away
And I ask my blessed Lord to lead the way
I just steal away I just steal away
I just steal away somewhere and pray

[ guitar - steel ]
 I know God will hear and answer all my prayers
And I thank him for my blessings every day
And when I'm burdened down with grief it will bring my soul relief
When I steal away to him and pray

I just steel away I just steal away...
I just steal away somewhere and pray
