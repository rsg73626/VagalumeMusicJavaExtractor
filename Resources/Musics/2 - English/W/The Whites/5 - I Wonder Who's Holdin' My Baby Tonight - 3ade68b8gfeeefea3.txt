I WONDER WHO'S HOLDIN' MY BABY TONIGHT

Tonight I'll be facin' a sad situation
I don't know how much more I could stand
Is he staying or leaving or making believing
That I don't know where he's been
Out with an old friend he's gone for the weekend
I wonder who kissed him good night
Don't he know that I miss him and need to be with him
I wonder who's holdin' my baby tonight

Dancing and drinking he's not really thinking
Of the love here at home he could find
I'm cold and lonely and think of him only
I wonder if baby's got me on his mind
I guess he feels lonely cause often he's told me
Just by the look in his eyes
Don't he know that I miss him and need to be with him
I wonder who's holdin' my baby tonight

 Don't he know that I miss him and need to be with him
I wonder who's holdin' my baby tonight
