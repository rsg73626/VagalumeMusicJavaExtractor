I'LL BE LOVIN' YOU

If the sun comes up tomorrow I'll be lovin' you
If it's dark and cloudy or if the skies are blue
You ask me if I'll love you love I'll tell you true
If the sun comes up tomorrow I'll be lovin' you

If there is tomorrow I'll be lovin' you
And I could never change this no matter what I do
So close your eyes my darling and act as though you knew
If the sun comes up tomorrow I'll be lovin' you

If there is tomorrow and if the sun goes down
If there's joy and sorrow and if the world goes round
You ask me if I'll love you love I'll tell you true
If the sun comes up tomorrow I'll be lovin' you

[ dobro ]
 If there is tomorrow and if the sun goes down...
I'll be lovin' you
