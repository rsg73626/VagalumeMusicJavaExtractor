I'VE CHANGED THE LOCK ON MY HEART'S DOOR

My girlfrieds say they've seen you round news travels fast in my hometown
Half a dozen calls on my machine why's everybody so worried about me
Don't they know I'm over you you don't get to me like you used to do
Don't bother comin' round here again cause this time boy you can't get in

Cause I've changed the lock on my heart's door
And you ain't welcome here no more
You don't own me like before
That key of yours don't work no more
I've changed the lock on my heart's door

[ steel ]
 You used to sweep me off the floor with the car you drove and the clothes you wore
Well honey I hate to burst your bubble but all you are to me is trouble
Countless heartaches and lonely nights I see things in a different light
Hey heartbreaker take a clue you don't impress me like you used to do

And I've changed the lock on my front door...

[ guitar ]
 Hey heartbreaker can't you see there ain't no way you're gonna get to me

Cause I've changed the lock on my heart's door...

That key of yours don't fit no more
I've changed the lock on my heart's door
