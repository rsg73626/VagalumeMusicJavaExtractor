GIVE A LITTLE BACK

Momma taught me a lot about livin' always be honest and kind
Take the gifts you've been given give a little back you'll do just fine
Give a little back give a little back
Give a little back you'll do just fine

Momma never had much education she went to work too young
But she made it up with pure determination
Cause back then in her day that was the way it was done

Momma taught me a lot about livin'...

Momma never was into keepin' up with everybody in town
She said the good Lord'll see that you always have enough
And what goes around comes back around

Momma taught me a lot about livin'...

Give a little back give a little back
Give a little back you'll do just fine

 Momma taught me a lot about livin'...
Momma taught me a lot about livin'...

Give a little back give a little back
Give a little back you'll do just fine
