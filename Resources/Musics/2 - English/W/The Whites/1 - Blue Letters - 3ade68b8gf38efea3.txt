BLUE LETTERS

Blue blue letters just how blue God only knows
Blue blue letters all tied up in ribbon and bows

Next to my heart are blue letters
All stained by the tears from my eyes
Blue blue letters letters when you said goodbye

[ guitar - piano ]
 Blue blue letters how they haunt my worried mind
Blue blue letters keep me losnesome all the time

Next to my heart are blue letters...
Letters when you said goodbye
