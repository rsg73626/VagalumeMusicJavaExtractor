WHOSE HEART ARE YOU BREAKING TONIGHT

Whose heart are you breaking tonight
Somewhere there's somebody crying
You don't care if it's wrong or right
Whose heart are you breaking tonight

Well love I tried but you told me lies you said I'd never be blue
How many dreams have you torn at the seams
The way that you tore mine in two

Whose heart are you breaking tonight...

[ steel - guitar ]
 Well love I'm through being hurt by you it's too high a price to pay
This time it's the end you won't fool me again
Oh no love at least not today

Whose heart are you breaking tonight...
Whose heart are you breaking tonight
