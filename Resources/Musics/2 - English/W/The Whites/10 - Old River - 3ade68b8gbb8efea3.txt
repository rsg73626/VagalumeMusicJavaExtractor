OLD RIVER

Old river lucky lucky old river
River everyday you just lay around Memphis and New Orleans

You don't worry bout the crops you don't drive the Interstate
You got no time for clocks cause you're never running late
You don't pass laws or worry if the mortgage payment's due
And old river lucky lucky old river
River I'm thinkin' you just roll along laughin' at the ones who do

Old river lucky lucky old river
How many times have I wished that I could be like you
You roll on to the music no matter what song they sing
And old river lucky lucky old river
River everyday you just lay around Memphis and New Orleans

[ dobro - guitar ]
 You never have fallen in love or looked into blue eyes
But you touch everything you see and you've heard all the lies
You're never gonna know what loneliness and heartaches are all about
Cause old river lucky lucky old river
River anytime you get to feeling blue you just head on south

Old river lucky lucky old river
How many times have I wished that I could be like you
You roll on to the music no matter what song they sing
And old river lucky lucky old river
River everyday you just lay around Memphis and New Orleans
