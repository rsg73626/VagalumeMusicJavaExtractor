GIVE LOVE AN INCH

I wasn't lookin' for love at all baby when you first found me
Swore I was happy all by myself wanted to be wild and free
Then you captured my soul that one fine day
Before I knew it I was swept away

Give love an inch it'll take a mile turn a shallow stream into the Nile
One little kiss one little smile give love an inch it'll take a mile

[ guitar - fiddle - dobro ]
 Your stubborn love would not give up till I let down my guard
I couldn't help it when I finally fell Lord I fell so hard
You got one foot through my heart's door
And now I can't live without you anymore

Give love an inch it'll take a mile...

[ guitar - steel ]
 Give love an inch it'll take a mile...
Give love an inch it'll take a mile
