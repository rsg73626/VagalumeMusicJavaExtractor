TILL THIS RING TURNS GREEN

Although she and dad were poor my momma had rich mem'ries
Of the day when the two of them were wed
He was savin' all his money for something very special
And on that day here's what my daddy said

My love for you is like this ring that I place on your finger
It's pure gold and it's my guarantee
That I'll love you when your golden hair may someday turn to silver
I will love you till this ring turns green

[ guitar - dobro ]
 I'm hopin' that the two of us truly be as happy
As mom and dad were blessed enough to be
I know that the love we share is something very special
I can hardly wait to hear you say to me

My love for you is like this ring...
My love for you is like this ring...
