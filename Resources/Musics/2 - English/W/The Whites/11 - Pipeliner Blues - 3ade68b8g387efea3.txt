PIPELINER BLUES

I'm an old pipeliner and I lay my line all day yeah
I'm an old pipeliner and I lay my line all day
I got four or five young'uns and a big ole fat wife
Just a waitin' to draw my pay Lawd Lawd

When you see me comin' babe you better raise your window high
When you see me comin' babe you better raise your window high
And when you see me leavin' you better hang your head and cry

[ dobro ]
 Well everytime I see you momma Lord you're always on the street
Everytime I see you momma you're always on the street
You hang around on the corner just like a policeman on the beat

She's got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
Eyes like two diamonds her teeth shine just the same
She's got sweet ruby lips and hair just like a hoss'n mane

[ bass - piano ]
 Lord I would walk from Dallas clear in to Wichita Falls
Lord I'd walk from Dallas clear in to Wichita Falls
But if I could see my babe that would be no walk at all
