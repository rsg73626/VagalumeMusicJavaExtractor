PROMISE LESS OR DO MORE

No need to fight about it,
No need to shout about it,
I'm sick and tired too.
I spend the hours searching
For better ways of working.
It's him and me and you.
So often taking your side,
So often slacking your line,
Hoping that you will grow.
Then get yourself together.
But it was now or never,
Already long ago.

Luck is a gift, but rarely only a random thing.
It's not enough to sit down and wait for a phone to ring.

A year a go somebody
Was here and now they tell me
Our issues were the same.
Whereas I've recently been,
We keep on keeping you in.
Nothing will ever change.
You must have heard it humming,
You must have seen it coming.
Your back had shown the belt.
Did you just never notice?
You know what high or low is,
You brought this on yourself.

Luck is a gift, but rarely only a random thing.
It's not enough to sit down and wait for a phone to ring.
