INTENTIONS

Announcing your
Intentions,
Easier
Said than done.

Announcing your
Intentions,
It's easier
Said than done.

But is it better to say nothing,
Than say something wrong?
When you only want someone
When that someone is gone.

Announcing your
Intentions,
It's easier
Said than done.

Hey, you can't own me.
Don't let that be a reason not to stay.
Hey, you can't own me.
Don't let that be a reason to run away.

Announcing your
Intentions,
It's easier
Said than done.
