FIGURES

There comes a time
For everyone
To sit down and assess what's there and what is not there
Eternally up in the air

And it seems that time has come for you
And it figues now
I was only the one who needed to appear and cause a turn of events
To force a turn of events

It's also fitting somehow
That I should be the last to know
And I'm blown away
When my friend tells me that it's so
What did I give you
That's harder to answer than what did I take

What did I mean to you?
