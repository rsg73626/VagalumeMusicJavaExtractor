ROLLERCOASTER RIDE

It's better that I believe
That it's over,
Waiting everyday for a line,
For a sign from you.

It's a rollercoaster ride
Of emotion
Paralyzing me,
Paralyzing me.

It's better that we build
On the dreams in our own world,
Than a bridge in between the two
That could never hold our weight,
That could never hold our weight,
That could never hold our weight.
