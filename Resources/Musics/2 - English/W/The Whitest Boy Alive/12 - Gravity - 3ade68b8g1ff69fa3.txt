GRAVITY

It's all fun,
Fun and games until,
Somebody sees what they should not see,
And the innocence is killed.
And not written,
Certainly not shown,
But eventually what's meant to be
Covered up gets done.

You only want to be with her because she's mine.
You will lose me as a friend if you cross that line.
She's the gravity my life circles around.
She's the gravity, my life circles around.

But how long
Can a cool cat keep his calm?
Despite the mounting evidence
That those cause for along
Cause for worry,
Cause for pain,
Physically threatening you,
Responsible alien.

You only want to be with her because she's mine.
(You're on)
You will lose me as a friend if you cross that line.
(So long)
She's the gravity my life circles around.
(Move on)
She's the gravity, my life circles around.
