LAND OF AGONY

No more tears to spill on
Diseased and dry ground
No rain tear to kiss this land
Nothing to look around
Just the pain and hopeless dreams
About lost paradises
Who wouldn't like to escape from this
Hell?
The white clothes' man is dying

Hear these women's cries
And see how her children die
There's no chance to live or dream
Just blood tears to cry

Time to time... darkness in their eyes
Waitin' for the light
No blessing from the sky!

No more hope to pray for the rain
The ground opens under feet
'cos the heart of god does not beat
Here
On the land of agony

No living-soul crawlin' on this land
Too dry, too hard and sick!
The punishment comes from above
For your pains... no relief!

Time after time... the sons of the lie
Just waiting to die

Time to time... darkness in their eyes
Waitin for the light
No blessing from the sky!
Cryin' and cryin'... no desire
Just the kiss of death
That's the answer of skies!

Time after time... when the vultures
Fly
Waiting' the end
Time after time... The sons of the lie
Just waitin' to die
