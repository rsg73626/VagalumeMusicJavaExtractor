JIL IS LUCKY

There are flowers in my room
And they don’t need a job
They just need time
To grow and die
And the lovers on their cloud
don’t give a shit about the money
They’re here to try
To stay side by side
But it’s so hard

‘Cause the morning always comes to kill the dream
You had the night before

Well I’m dragging myself all along the pavement
Up in the sky, there’s someone behind
And he’s guiding my steps
Up and down the life stairs
Helps me thereby leaving again

And I’m walking all damned day
Day after day
But it’s okay
I’m on my way
Wandering again from the West to the East
I try to resist
But it’s so hard not to fall

‘Cause the morning always comes to kill the dream
You had the night before

Well I’m dragging myself all along the pavement
Up in the sky, there’s someone behind
And he’s guiding my steps
Up and down the life stairs
Helps me thereby leaving again
