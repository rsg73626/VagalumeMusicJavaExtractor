NEAR FATAL EXPLOSION

I'd go running through the rain and snow, 
Just to make you mine, please give me a sign. 
Shoot a bottle rocket at your window, 
Got your attention now and then I'll give a shout. 
Remember when we sat around, 
The fire burned and my heart pounded. 
Go ahead and kiss me now, this could be the last time ever. 
Sometimes, I feel, nothing is for real 
And then sometimes, they'll say your love is to far away 
And then sometimes i feel like your mine, 
Do you believe that i'd do anything for you? 
What do you want? And i will take it for you.
Do me a favor, its nothing major, 
Could you hold me forever no matter what? 
Hold on.
