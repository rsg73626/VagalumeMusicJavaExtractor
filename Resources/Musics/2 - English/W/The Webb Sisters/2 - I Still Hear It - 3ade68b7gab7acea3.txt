I STILL HEAR IT

Something by the fireside flickers in the blue flame
Reflections of the midnight sky softly whispers your name

Your memory is calling to me
Though the days we had are gone
A song in my soul wherever I go
It lives on and on and on

I still hear it hear it in my head now singing
I still hear it hear it in my head now singing

Driving in the morning light as I look out the window
It's as though you're by my side when I feel the wind blow

Your memory is calling to me
Though I'm left to dance alone
Wherever I go I'm hearing your song
It echoes on and on and on

I still hear it hear it in my head now singing, you're in my head
I still hear it hear it in my head now singing, all that you said
You feel so near me everyting you said still ringing

It's not enough to feel you near I want you hear with me
I wish that you were somewhere I could be

I still hear it hear it in my head now singing, you're in my head
I still hear it hear it in my head now singing, all that you said
You feel so near me everyting you said still ringing
Where do I go from here?
'Cause you're never going to fade away
