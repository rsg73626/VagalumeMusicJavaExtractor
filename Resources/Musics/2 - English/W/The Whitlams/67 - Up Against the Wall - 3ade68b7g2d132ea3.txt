UP AGAINST THE WALL

To think it was going so well
We'd go out at night come home and fight like hell
Good fights about big things
You know just pushing around in the dark 

To think I was scared to open the box
New love on the doorstep isn't it funny there's nothing on how it works
Go on have a look inside
You won't know what you did without it 

Well you slept
You met interesting people
And you slept with them
I'm up against the wall now 

Hotel room, a silent phone
A packet of fags, a bottle of wine, a suitcase you call your own
When the darkness comes from the inside out
And even the barmen are pricks 

Vitriol, the cigarettes
A long night of thinking and the search for the best vignettes
Yeah well it was good wasn't it
Then it got bad,p> Some say love it only comes once in a lifetime
Well once is enough for me
She was one in a million
So there's five more just in New south Wales 

There's a show on the television now
A man in the jungle with monkeys, he's saying we've come so far
Yeah well it's news to me
I'd better go evolve now 

To think it was going to well
We'd go out at night come home and fight like hell
Good fights about big things
Like "who wrote the book on men?"
Well it was me 

I'm up against the wall now
And I'm afraid to say I must fail her
