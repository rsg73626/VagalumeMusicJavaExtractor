OUT THE BACK

I wake and the sun has returned
Trees with their majesty back
I walk down to the sea
Yeah, I'll borrow some wax

I can sit out here like a teabag
No more exercise for me
Now I've made it out the back

Breathing in the colors
The blue was resting up for today
While it was kicking back
They were glass-blowing these waves

Its how the gum trees 
Are stamped into the sky
I could be eight years old 
With these colors in my eyes

Waking up in a dream out here
Sun is so low
It's throwing its shimmers at me
Skimming its stones

I can sit out here like a teabag
No more exercise for me
Now I've made it out the back

Back there they're bitching
I'm guilty of it too
Out here if you want a wave
Theres another one coming soon

I'm not surfing
I'm sitting out the back
All the kids are dropping in
On the old man on the plank
The kids are dropping in
On the old man on the plank
