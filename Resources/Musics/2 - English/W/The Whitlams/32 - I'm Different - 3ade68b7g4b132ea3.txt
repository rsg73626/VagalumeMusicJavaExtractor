I'M DIFFERENT

I'm different I don't care who knows it
Something about me's just not the same
I'm different that's how it goes
I'm not going to play your god damn games 

Got a different way of talking
Got a different kid of smile
I got a different way of walking
Drives the women kind of wild 

(He's different) I don't care who knows it
(There's something about him) that's not the same
(He's different) that's how it goes
I'm not going to play your god damn games 

Not saying that I'm better than you are
Or maybe I am
All I know is when I look in the mirror
I like the man (we like the man!) 

I'm different that's how it goes
Something about me's just not the same
I'm different that's how it goes
I'm not going to play your god damn games 

I walk down the street in the morning and
blue birds are singing in the old oak tree
Yeah I sing a little song for the people
Little song from me (tralala lalala lalala laaaa) (He's different) I don't care who knows it
(There's something about him) that's not the same
(He's different) that's how it goes
I'm not going to play your god damn games 

(He's different) I don't care who knows it
(There's something about him) that's not the same
(He's different) that's how it goes
I'm not going to play your god damn games
