DON'T BELIEVE ANYMORE

I never counted on this
guess that's the way that it goes
you used to be, someone I knew
somebody I could understand

now I don't know what to do
and I don't know who you are
all those things, I hear you say
you talk that way, I'm a stranger to you

[Chorus]
I don't know where to begin, don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
and this is all I know, I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

I don't believe anymore
[/EC]


And I remember your voice
before this happened to us
when I could see, when I was sure,
when everything was young and new but..
we lost it too many times
and that's way that it is ends
yeah lovers come and lovers go
when you think you know, it just isn't true

(Chorus)

I don't believe anymore

[Bridge]

(Chorus)

I don't believe anymore

(Chorus)

I don't believe anymore

I don't believe anymore
