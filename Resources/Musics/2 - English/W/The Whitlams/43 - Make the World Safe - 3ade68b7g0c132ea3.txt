MAKE THE WORLD SAFE

I know they all want you
With your Desdemona's eyes
I'll keep you from danger
Save you from prying eyes 

I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad'll happen now 

I've got a problem
I think you know how I feel
Plans piling up in the corner
Eyeballing me every hour 

Got a balcony
And an orange tree
You can save up and visit New York with me
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad at all 

You've got no money
So I know how you feel
When you see the glitter
Turn around it's no big deal 

I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad'll happen now
