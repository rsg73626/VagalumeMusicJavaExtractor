I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY (DUFFY'S SONG)

I will not go quietly
I will not accept your rules
gonna live with myself
before I live with any of you

I will not go quietly
I will not behave myself
Itâ€™s not for sake of fighting
Itâ€™s not for you or anyone else
and I was the best, you all knew it
on the days I cared at all
you can all say I blew it, youâ€™ll be talking bout me for years

I was my own man
can yaâ€™ll say that?
I was my own man
can yaâ€™ll say that?
I was my own man, yeah I was the shit.

I donâ€™t believe in Bondi,
donâ€™t believe in rugby league
I believe in Yoko, John Lennon, last weekend and me

Well I was the best you all knew it,
on the days I cared at all
now you can all say I blew it, youâ€™ll be talking bout me for years

I was my own man
can yaâ€™ll say that?
I was my own man
can yaâ€™ll say that?
I was my own man, yeah I was the shit.

I will not go quietly
I will not go quietly
I will not accept your rules
I donâ€™t believe in Bondi
Donâ€™t believe in rugby league
I will not go quietly (repeat till fade)
