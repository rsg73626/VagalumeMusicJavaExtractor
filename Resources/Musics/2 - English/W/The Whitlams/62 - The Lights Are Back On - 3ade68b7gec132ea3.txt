THE LIGHTS ARE BACK ON

We made love for an album
Everything went quiet at once
So good to be lying
Happy and sane in your arms

I don't care what they do
'Cause being here with you
Is news to me
Tell everybody
The lights are back on

We made civic art
Under a streetlight
Something for the drivers tonight
Monday's my Sunday
I don't have a thing to do
But try and get up
While it's still light

Dearheart,
How I've been everywhere
