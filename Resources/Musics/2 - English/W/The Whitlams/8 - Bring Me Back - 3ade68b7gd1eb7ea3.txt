BRING ME BACK

You can see that I'm trying
But it doesn't come easily to me
I'm hard around the eyes
And like a gangster on the lookout
I know the ending now
Show me, bring me back to your love


I don't keep real good company
Thats all that keeps me sane
Show me can you bring me back to your love?


I can see you've been crying
I wish you could bring it on in me
I don't cry anymore
Outside the movies
and sometimes in my dreams
Show me, bring me back to your love



I don't keep real good company
Thats all that keeps me sane
Show me can you bring me back to your love?


I don't keep real good company
Thats all that keeps me sane
Show me can you bring me back to your love?


I don't keep real good company
Thats all that keeps me sane
Show me can you bring me back to your love?

I don't keep real good company
Thats all that keeps me sane
Show me can you bring me back to your love?
Show me can you bring me back to your love?
