FALL FOR YOU

Broad horizon as i walk from your embrace 
What i feel is nothing but the taste of you 
I get buried in your mouth 
I fall in, i don't care if i can't climb out 

Look at the moon but i see only you 
Three days away, i'm a man in a caravan 
By the sea 
Waving at the old folks waving at me 

I'll fall for you 
When i get on and shake my pride 
I'll call on you 
We can do better than i am tonight 

Be strong and you'll get strength back 
Feed the fire and you'll get warmth back 

I'm walking the plank, edging out, see the drop 
If i take a new step will you follow or stop? 
I look back from the ocean beneath to your eyes 
Are we in it together now? 

If you've got any doubt i'll cast them out 
I feel you close around me, i'm living for two 
And why i'm laughing i'll remember for you
