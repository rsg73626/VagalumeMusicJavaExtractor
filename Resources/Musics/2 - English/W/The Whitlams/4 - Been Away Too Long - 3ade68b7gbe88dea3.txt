BEEN AWAY TOO LONG

Everything looks strange to me like a recurring dream
I think I know what's coming, til it turns out wrong
I’ve been away, away too long 
I can’t change where I’ve been the bad I’ve done and seen 
But my heart has a home and it got here on its own 
I’ve been away, away too long 

Been away too long 
Through a doorway in the night towards the sound of cheering 
I’ll be gone at a minute to 12 
You don’t want to have to see me turn into myself 
I’ve been away too long 
There’s a warmth that I miss familiar like a kiss 
But the girls had no name and the singer no song
I’ve been away, away too long 

When we burn the cane the mice all run 
When the cane is burnt the mice all run 
When the fire burnt out I came back home 
When the cane was burnt I came back home 

There’s no gate and no wall in my way at all 
And if Janis died for my sins even I can start again 
I've been away too long
