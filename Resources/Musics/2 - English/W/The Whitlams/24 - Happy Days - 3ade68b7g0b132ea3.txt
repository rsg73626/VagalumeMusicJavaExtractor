HAPPY DAYS

Monday - my day of rest
Tuesday - I do my best
Wednesday - I wander round the town 

Thursday - I get depressed
Friday - my hair's a mess
But then the weekend comes around 

Yeah, I'll borrow ten bucks and go out drinking
There's a party going on and I've been thinking
We'll grab a case of beer and go down there and see what it's all about
Gonna get myself wiped out 

Then Julie phoned and this is what she said 

She said ain't had a holiday in the past five years
Working my fingers to the bone
Forget that grease and grime, for now it's party time
Come and leave that nine to five alone 

Yeah, I'll borrow a car, we'll go out speedin'
There's a party going on and I've been needin'
Have a drink and talk with you to see what you're all about
Come and get yourself wiped out 

Five days a week in the workforce is just enough to drive anyone mad
But stick with me Julie baby
It's more fun being poor than sad 

(Gotta get in, gotta get out and lose some skin) 

Yeah, borrow ten buck...
Party going on...
Drink some beer...
And see what it's all about 

Gonna get myself
Gonna get myself
Gonna get myself wiped out
