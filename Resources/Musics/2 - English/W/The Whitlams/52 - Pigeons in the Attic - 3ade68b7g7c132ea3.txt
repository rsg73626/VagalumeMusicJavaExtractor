PIGEONS IN THE ATTIC

Well I hate to have to tell you this
But there were pigeons in the attic room
When you left me standing gasping that afternoon
And where the floorboards left their splinters
As you left me so soon 

And me, I'm drunk again
And when I'm drunk I make no sense
But I crack more jokes and that's my self defense
You caused me to think
And I thought about what I had done without you
You drove me to drink
And I never had the courtesy to thank you
