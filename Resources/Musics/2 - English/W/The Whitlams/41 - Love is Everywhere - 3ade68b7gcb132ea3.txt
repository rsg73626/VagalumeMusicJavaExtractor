LOVE IS EVERYWHERE

Love is everywhere, I don't want to bend down and pick it up
Love is everywhere, a shocking week but can Sunday bail me out
Love is everywhere, I want to sit here and hear the sound of that thing 

What can an elfin do, put on a kettle for you?
Leave your mother in the cupboard, the writing's on the wall
I'm not coming back here no anymore 

Take it all from me, I don't want it
Love is everywhere, I don't want to bend down and pick it up
Love is everywhere, I might just sit here and look around 

Watching the day go by, putting all your eggs in the sky
Catch a bus and read a poem, look around there's no-one home
I think that I might stay here for quite a while 

Love is everywhere, my mum's got a new boyfriend and I like the man
Take it all from me, je ne veux pas coucher avec toi ce soir
Love is everywhere, I want to sit here and hear the sound of that thing
