BUY NOW PAY LATER (CHARLIE NO.2)

Charlie you're not my Charlie anymore
You're screwing it up
You're killing your soul with an audience looking on 

If I hadn't left early last night
I would have made a speech to you
How you're not the only one you're going to hurt 

If you don't believe me I don't believe in you
Makes it all feel better does it?
Makes you feel like heaven does it?
You loved it and you spent accordingly 

You can't afford it now
You'll try and you'll fail
And love it like a little dog
And feed it on the scraps you find
And kiss it while you're still asleep
You buy now and pay laterp So where's the problem you can ask if you keep your head up
But the road is long and you're falling asleep at the wheel
Here's a girl going crazy about you and I'm not far behind
Can you care about your friends anymore?
You buy now and pay later
