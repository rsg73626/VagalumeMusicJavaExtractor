TIME

It's been some months and here she is again
In the room where we did it all
Careless reminders of another girl staying here 
Are hard to ignore 

She don't feel jealous no, she just feels strange
Time is doing well by us 

Beautiful when love fades slowly
And we talk with the ease of old
Later on, cooling down slow
Nothing between us solved 

Our love is fading, but how could you tell?
It's killing the pain, sparing the love
It's doing well by us 

Time
Time
Time is doing well by us 

It's been some months since she came around
Lying where she used to lie
She's so beautiful I could eat her
Been some months, making me love too slow
Making me love so, so long
