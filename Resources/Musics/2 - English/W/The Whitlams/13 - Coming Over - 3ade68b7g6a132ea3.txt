COMING OVER

Can you divide the meaning
by the number of your words?
The money in your pocket
by the masters that you serve?
Its not the destination,
Its whats around the curve

Coming over to come down
Gotta talk to you before I hit the ground
Yeah I think its gonna take all night

The week is slippin' away from me
Something isnt right
Might be better to sweat it out
But I dont know how to fight myself anymore

Coming over to come down
Gotta talk to you before I hit the ground
Yeah I think its gonna take all night

Takes me a while to taper off
I like a long ramp down
So I am a little shaky
A little moisture on my brow
