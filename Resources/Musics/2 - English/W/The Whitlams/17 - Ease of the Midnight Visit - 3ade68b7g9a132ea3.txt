EASE OF THE MIDNIGHT VISIT

Show me a way to stop lovin you
And I'll stop coming 'round
Your flatmate in the front room,
He thinks he may have found - 
The last of the teenage lovers
Surprised by what I feel
The last of the teenage lovers
I'm learning how to deal

With the ease of the midnight visit
The ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith
That you might be alone

I was dreamin of you this morning
Dreaming all last night
Your greedy new manoeuvres,
They moke me up in fright
I watched the sunlight climbing up my bedroom door
Who had taught my sweetheart to ask for so much more

Ahh with the ease of the midnight visit
The ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith
That you might be alone

Born again to die again
My soul is in this body
Born again to die again
My soul is in this body
Better give it a bit of peace

I was trying to save your flatmate
From getting out of bed so late
Like a big old clumsy cat
Perched on top of your side gate
The last of the teenage lovers thinks
"What a way to go"
I'd call the ambulance myself
if  could reach the phone
The last of the teenage lovers
"What a way to go"
Its not enough to be in love wth you
I want to be loved too

Yeah thats the ease of the midnight visit
Takes a leap of faith that you might be alone
Whens a fool like me gonna drive straight home?
