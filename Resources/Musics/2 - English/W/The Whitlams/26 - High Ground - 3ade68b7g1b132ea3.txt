HIGH GROUND

You've got your favourite programmes
The bird, the dog, two cats
One of your babies will always
Ring on the weekend for a chat 

A beautiful garden
Too easily getting out of hand
How can you concentrate at all? 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground 

And from down here we can feel it
You can move the mountain with your pain
They all want to be near you
And then too soon drive home again
'Cause grief is like that
And you're like a captain on her ship -
In the end you stand alone 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground
You see the mourners have gone home
On the high ground
You're there on your own 

The city is spreading
Soon only numbers will be pure
And you are retreating 

And now I walk between tables
Hide in the bathroom for some peace
They want to know what has happened
We can't tell the truth it must be lived
Over and over
'Til it floats up into the sky
To your beautiful baby 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground
You see the mourners have gone home
On the high ground
You're there on your own 

Days of our Lives and Dr Katz
You've got a few friends left
But she's never coming back
She was the one with the questions
And the big blue eyes
On that high ground
