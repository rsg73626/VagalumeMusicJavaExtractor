CHUNKY CHUNKY AIR GUITAR

She came from the Cocos Islands with a limp and a snow-shaker huh
Hocked by a fine Arabian ginger Monsignor
He said, "You aints gets nothing 'cause nothing gets made by Koreans"
He had dubbin in his hair and he played the tambourine 

They gave him a medal, they caught him shaving his hairpiece
Locked him in confinement wired like a banshee with a blade
She came to him in a dream disguised as a bus crash
Through the mud, the blood and the tears they kissed
And then they slipped away, they were singin' 

Chunky chunky air guitar now
Chunky chunky air guitar 

He was getting down like a freak show
She was going off like a whale
Chunky chunky air guitar now
Chunky chunky air guitar 

Bellhop blues with a midget butt-boy in Sweden
Chockfull of puss and wolved by a little French maid
Eloped with his sister, married in a tag-team wedding
Sticky like a girl undercover of a Japanese glade 

She came from the Cocos Islands, she came from the Cocos Islands
She came from the Cocos Islands, she came from the Cocos Islands
And they were singing 

Chunky chunky air guitar now
Chunky chunky air guitar
He was getting down like a freak show
He was getting down like a freak show
He was getting down like a freak show
She was going off like a whale
