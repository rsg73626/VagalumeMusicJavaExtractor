IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN

I could while away the hours
Conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain
And my head, I'd be scratchin'
As my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain 

I'd unravel ev'ry riddle
For every individ'le
In trouble or in pain
In my head I'd be thinkin'
I could be another Lincoln
If I only had a brain 

Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I'd never thunk before
Then I'd sit, and think some more
Oh I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I'd never thunk before
Then I'd sit, and think some more 

I would not be just a nuffin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
And perhaps I'd deserve you
And be even worthy of you
If I only had a brain 

Ohh.....
