1995

My sweet thing is pretending
Does a fine line in deception
What night did she fall
Or does it mean more
To know what I did the night before 

There's nothing I can do
No way that I can hurt myself 

My sweet thing reveals nothing
Does a fine line in deception
My sweet thing is pretending
Caught her on the phone last night 

There's nothing I can do
No way that I can hurt myself
There's nothing I can say
And I'll be going out tonight 

It's 1995
You can talk to beggars to feel alright
You got a hundred dollar bill to spend tonight
Her husband's in Florida looking for life
While a drunk Australian's in bed with his wife
You're allergic to cats, you better crash out
Here's an American sleeping pill in your mouth
