SHINING

I can see it shinin'
It's coming for me comin' out of the night
Everything is hummin' it's scarin' me now
It ain't feelin' right 

Think I might just hide a while wait for the night to return
Dark and cold and lonely
Is how I feel and it feels nice
Don't want any company it just wouldn't feel right 

I used to be so happy I could smile
And everything seemed to work out
Now my eyes are starting to close down
I can see you again in my dreams
You're starring my lost and lonely friend 

We used to have such good times
Why did you leave before our time was through? 

Everything looks pretty we're far from the city
And I'm holding you in my arms
You feel so alive and so do I
Isn't it a pity that soon I'll wake and soon I'll cry 

I can't stop reminiscing about what is missing in my life
I'm scared of everything
I got nothing to hold onto
If I believed in God then maybe I could give myself up too 

But I'm not too sure about the after-life
So I'm just gonna go on dreamin' of you
