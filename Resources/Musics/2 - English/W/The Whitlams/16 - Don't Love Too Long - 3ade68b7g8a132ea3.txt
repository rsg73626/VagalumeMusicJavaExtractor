DON'T LOVE TOO LONG

Don't love too long, I loved too long
And fell out of fashion like an old song
Over the years our thoughts were the same
Then in a minute she changed
And you remember you saw me there
I was feeling so lucky sinking in my chair
Don't love too long I loved too long
And fell out of fashion like an old song
