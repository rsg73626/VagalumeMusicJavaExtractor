WE MADE CIVIC ART

There's no-one to call from a country town
It's not a bad thing
I don't have anyone lovely to call
And it's not a bad thing

I'm not doing the dirty, breaking a vow
I'm not a tomcat doing the rounds
And if I were there'd be no-one to complain

There's no-one worrying at home
Ringing to see if I'll answer the phone
Happy if after the show I'm alone

There's no-one to call from a country town
And say I got a tan
Or we played under the biggest pergola
This side of Japan

The mountains are hazy - the mist from the sea
Is it good luck for dolphins on the same wave as me?
Or, honey-child I miss you just same

There's no-one worrying at home
Ringing to see if I'll answer the phone
Happy if after the show I'm alone

It's strange to be happy if your boyfriend's lonely
But that's the way they are
It's strange to be happy if your girlfriend's lonely
But that's the way we are
But no-one's worrying at home
