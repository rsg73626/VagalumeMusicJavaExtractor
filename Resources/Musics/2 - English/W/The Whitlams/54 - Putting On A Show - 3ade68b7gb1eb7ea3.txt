PUTTING ON A SHOW

So you see no future
You stopped seeing any hope
Get your ass over here
We're putting on a show

I'm going to show you
How I learned to cook and sew
We can laugh at all the fools we know
We can laugh at all the fools we know

So he left you quickly
With no time for any tears
Now you're on your lonesome there
With the passing of the years

Get your ass over here
I'm putting on a show
We can laugh at all the fools we know
We can laugh at all the fools we know

Get your ass over here
Get your ass over here
I'm putting on a show
