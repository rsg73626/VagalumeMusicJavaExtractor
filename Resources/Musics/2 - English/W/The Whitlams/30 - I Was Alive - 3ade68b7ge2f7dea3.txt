I WAS ALIVE

The night I met you were a fucking disgrace 
Tripping over people falling flat on your face 
I thought I’d dance with you ‘cause you wouldn’t remember 
A year ago now yeah that was the end of December 
There’s been blood, and there’s been biting 
There’s been Lizzie Taylor Richard Burton fighting
It’s all gone bad, that’s alright 
‘Cause god I was alive 
God I was alive 

You found your schoolgirl French somewhere in the haze 
And I was gone by the middle of the very first phrase 
All’s fair in love and war in the Eastern Suburbs I suppose 
So I emptied the contents of my pocket in your nose 

Well here’s been blood, and there’s been biting 
There’s been drunk and disorderly fighting 
All down the street and through the night 
God I was alive 
God I was alive 

She don’t know which one to buy 
Australian Shooter or Australian Bride 

I throw my head up into the sky 
Thank Dionysius for a little while I was alive 

Using up fast the last days of my youth 
Trying to see if you were coming from my hot tin roof 
And rolling down the highway looking like an evil child 
40 hours later you’d be back in the wild 

There’s been blood, biting, Lizzie and Richard, fighting 
It’s all gone bad, but that’s alright 
All down the street, all through the night 
And god I was alive
