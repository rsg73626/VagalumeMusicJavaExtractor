GOUGH

Little song about a man called Gough
and a little boy who wanted to be tarred with the same brush
He learnt Latin, held his head up high and he hated the
Liberals tho' he didn't know why 

There were reasons - how long have you got?
There are always reasons - how long have you got? 

The little boy he's on the stage tonight, his name is Anthony Hayes and he's doing alright
They both went to the same local Canberra school, but Stevie was nine in 1972 

What a party - a big day for both of us
A big reason to party - a big day for both of us 

Come over have dinner with me, we'll play chess and drink claret
Walk slowly down my little street, you can bring Margaret 

November 11 was Armistice Day
A bushranger was slaughtered and Gough was betrayed
November 11 - he wouldn't survive the Governor General in '75 

November 11 - a big day for all of us
I said November 11 - Ned Kelly died
Shame Fraser shame and we all cried
For you Gough you Gough you Gough
Edward Gough Whitlam
You Gough you Gough you Gough
Edward Gough Whitlam 

Days of wine and roses, days of wine and roses
All the artists flew in and all the arseholes flew out in '72
For you Gough you Gough you Gough
Edward Gough Whitlam
