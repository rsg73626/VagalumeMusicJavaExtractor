YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME

I've been watchin' you
For so long now
You know I feel just
A little ashamed
You know I follow you
Wherever you go
Hoping one day
Things might change 

Maybe someday you will notice me
And this won't be just a game 

You know I've seen every show
You've ever done
You don't even know my name
You don't even know my name 

Maybe Monday hopefully someday
Yeah all my luck will change
'Til then I'll just follow you
Wherever you go
You don't even know my name
You don't even know my name
