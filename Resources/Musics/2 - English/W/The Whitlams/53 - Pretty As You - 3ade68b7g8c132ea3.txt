PRETTY AS YOU

He's better looking than he looks
His music is better than it sounds
When he won't speak
Still waters run deep
All of this is true
When you're as pretty as you 

Yeah anything is true
When you're as pretty as you 

He likes the same bands as you
It's getting stranger but it's true
Didn't you see him up the front
When they were starting out? 

He had a picture of you
In his head before you met
And all of this is true
When you're as pretty as you 

Yeah anything is true
When you're as pretty as you 

But when you get a look at his life it's too late
Yeah when you get a look at his life it's too late 

Ah the evening leans forward
On the edge of its seat
'Cause you're laughing with him
Yeah you're nearly in bed 

He's better looking than he looks
My music is better than it sounds
All of this is true
When you're as pretty as you 

Yeah anything is true
When you're as pretty as you
