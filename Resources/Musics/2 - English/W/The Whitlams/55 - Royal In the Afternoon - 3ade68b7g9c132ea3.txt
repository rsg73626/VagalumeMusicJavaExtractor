ROYAL IN THE AFTERNOON

I won't drink, I won't smoke
Won't get home at a hundred o'clock
Nobody's gonna satisfy me
Except you and the baby and the colour TV

I was always in my prime
Now I'm falling over the line
The boys are sad they have let me go
But you got it all to get me home

You quiet me down
Been all over the place and I ain't found anyone
Keep my feet on the ground, no

We can be bigger than my old habits
Over my dead body but still
If I am awake in the morning
We'll be royal in the afternoon

You be the Queen,
And be the Mad King of it all!

The words of a drunk fade with the light
Satan delivers and the goods are alright
He's at home now counting the dough
I'm standing here for another last throw

You quiet me down
Been all over the place and I ain't found anyone
Keep my feet on the ground, no

We can be bigger than my bad habits
Over my dead body but still
If I am awake in the morning
We'll be royal in the afternoon

You be the Queen,
And be the Mad King of it all!
