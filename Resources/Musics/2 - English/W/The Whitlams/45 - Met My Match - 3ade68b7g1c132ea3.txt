MET MY MATCH

Met my match she was five foot one
Face goes red bouncing up and down
Takes her pleasure eyes wide open
Big green eyes looking through me 

Met my match she was pretty as a garden
Gap-toothed as bright as a button
So tiny curled up warm in bed
Big green eyes looking through me
I met my match 

And she's coming 'round to me and all my funny ways
I'm never friendly on the phone
It pays to remember that the boy she had before me
Well he couldn't have been perfect or she'd be with him still 

I met my match pretty as a garden
Met my match bright as a button
I met my match 

Light the candles I'm coming over
I met my match five foot one her face goes red bouncing up and down
Close the curtains I'm coming over
I met my match
