LIFE'S A BEACH

Burning all the photos, sorting through the clothes
You bought this new for me and now it's full of holes
Remember babytalk in the morning
What's the hurry my girl?
You don't need any coffee if you take the day off school 

We're all over and I'm all over town
We've got work here tearing it down 

You know it's quicker packing for a holiday
'Cause I'd see these things again
I loved you in this T-shirt of mine
You can have it - it says "Life's a Beach" 

There's a beach umbrella, couple lying in the sun
And for once in my life it's not the people from the suburbs
It's me's got it wrong 

On through the evening and into the dawn
Journey me, journey me
Where love keeps on 

Burning all the photos, they have a habit of mocking a single man
I'm keeping the first one, we're not even holding hands 

We're all over and I'm all over town
We've got work here tearing it down
There's a beach umbrella, couple lying in the sun
And for once in my life it's not the people from the suburbs
It's me's got it wrong
