WHERE IS SHE

Where is she? I've been driving 'round this town
Poking my head in the corners we used to sit
Stop for a bottle, there'll be trouble wherever I go
Some neat and sensible girl screaming for order 

Who would've known I'd be lonely
Here on my own she's so lovely
Lovely, lovely 

Loved her room, sleep all day with no doorknocks for me
Let the phone ring and suburbs away my one ringing along with it
Stop for a bottle, there'll be trouble wherever I go
Some neat and sensible girl screaming for order 

Who would've known I'd be lonely
Here on my own she's so lovely
Lovely, lovely 

Not together or 'sleep by her side
Get me someone to get her out of my mind
Not together or 'sleep by her side
Get me someone to get her out of my mind
