YOU'LL FIND A WAY

No doubt you're crying three suburbs away
Life goes on me I'm walking around the block
You said we never should have bothered
But I looked into your heavy eyes and I said "No"

You'll find a way to be happy again my love
You'll find a way to be happy again my old love

You can't say they were bad times
Remember you laughing
yourself off the bed?
Ain't sex funny
something to be done
Occasionally with
someone you don't hate

You'll find a way...

We had a fine time
dancing with the fairies
But time has left me
so reserved again my love
Time has left me
so reserved again my old love

You'll find a way...
