JUMPIN' LEPRECHAUNS

Back in the park, nearly dark
What do I now hear, hark hark
Is it really leprechauns have come back to rock and roll?
Oh yes it's them out on the lawn
Been so long since they've been gone
Mother nature's leprechauns have come back to rock and roll 

Um ba da da da da dia da
Um ba da da da da dia
Um ba da da da da dia da
They've come back to rock and roll 

Um ba da da da da dia da
Um ba da da da da dia
Um ba da da da da dia da
They've come back to rock and roll 

We'll see them rockin' and a rollin'
They're wobblin' and a wiggling
They're stompin' and a giggling
They hear rock 'n' roll 

Well yes it's them out on the lawn
Been so long since they've been gone
Mother nature's leprechauns have come back to rock and roll
With a how you doing? Where you been?
Oh it's so good to have you back my friends
I know right now it was never meant to end
They've come back to rock 'n' roll 

Um ba da da da da dia da
Um ba da da da da dia
Um ba da da da da dia da
They've come back to rock and roll 

Um ba da da da da dia da
Um ba da da da da dia
Um ba da da da da dia da
They've come back to rock and roll 

We'll see them rockin' and a rollin'
They're wobblin' and a wiggling
They're stompin' and a giggling
And they're hear rock 'n' roll 

Well, yes it's them out on the lawn
Been so long since they've been gone
Mother nature's leprechauns have come back to rock and roll
With a how you doing? How you been?
Oh it's so good to have you back again
I know right now it was never meant to end
They've come back to rock 'n' roll
