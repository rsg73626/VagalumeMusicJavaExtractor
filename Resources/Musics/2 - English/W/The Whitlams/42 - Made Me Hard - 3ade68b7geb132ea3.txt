MADE ME HARD

You made me hard, you made me cold
I was simple, but now I know 

Nobody wants to be the weak one
We all want to go from strength to strength 

You made me hard, you made me strong
I was simple but not for long 

Nobody wants to be the weak one
We all want to go from strength to strength
If I could go back in time, well I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing 

I brought to you a kind disposition
You led me on and you rejected me
It took a while but I've accepted
I learnt a slow and painful lesson 

You made me hard, you made me strong
I was simple but not for long 

I wonder what you find so attractive
I've never seen you looking this excited
So let's just leave it at one third each
'Cause we both want something so far out of reach 

You made me hard, you made me cold
I was simple but now I know
Now I know
