I GET HIGH

I get high when trouble arises
Something in me surrenders and falls
Say my goodbyes when trouble arises
I smell trouble I look to the door
I used to think I'd been down for so long
Then I get back my health it don't seem right
Some of us are just born to be wrong
And you and me Stevie
We were wrong from the start 

When I get worried
I'm usually worried about Tim
Maybe too much maybe the lack of him
I call up all my friends and say
Why don't you help me
I need a reason to get out of bed
Why don't you remind me? 

I got home and I look in the mirror
Puff out my cheeks - I'm still the man
I get home and look through my pockets
Where's all the money gone? 
Numbers and no faces no names in my head
Numbers and no faces no names in my head
I'll say goodnight to me goodnight to me
Goodnight tockley...
