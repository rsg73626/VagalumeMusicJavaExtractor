THE CURSE STOPS HERE

Stevie left on a Friday too
They made the easy way look hard
We never thought too much about letting go
They took it all too far again

My first days back and I was rolling round the town
Saying stay away from edges and from ropes if you can
'Cause I am the last one...
And the curse stops here
The curse stops here

Ghosts dont drag you towards their light
They make it brighter here for you
Seeing Stevie helped me through from over there
But will his friend now help him out?

My first days back and I was rolling round the town
Saying stay away from edges and from ropes if you can
My friends said I was saying it, too many times
Leave the gallow humour for the gallow people that it finds

'Cause I am the last one...
And the curse stops here
The curse stops here
