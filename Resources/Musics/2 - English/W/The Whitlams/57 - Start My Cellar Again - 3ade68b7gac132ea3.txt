START MY CELLAR AGAIN

That was the longest weekend on record
And friday seems like a year ago
There are broken glasses all over the place
And you've gone home

You know that I love you nearly every day
Looks like I'm going to have to
Start my cellar again

You deserve better
Maybe I am the best for you right now

Tuesday is on the phone again
But I got a couple of days o get well
And then we'll start our engines again
Try and ignore where we fell

You deserve better
Maybe I am the best for you right now
Or you could try leave the anchor
Where you left it

Yeah and I want an intervention
But no-one has got the guts
I suppose we can hide a lot from our friends
Me? I just dont come home from lunch
