BREATHING YOU IN

I'm awake
You sleep on and on
When you wake my head is resting on your shoulder
I'm breathing you in
I'm breathing you in

Don't get up I'm in heaven
Close your eyes it's only half past seven
The day's as small as the window
And I'm an inside-outted pillow

Breathing in my, my sleepy girl
Breathing in my, my sleepy girl

What's that over there?
It's nothing at all
We lie awake and listen to the birds in my aviary
I'm breathing you in
I'm breathing you in

Don't get up I'm in heaven
Close your eyes it's only - eleven
The day's as small as the window
And I'm an inside-outted pillow

I'm breathing you in

Breathing in my, my sleepy girl
