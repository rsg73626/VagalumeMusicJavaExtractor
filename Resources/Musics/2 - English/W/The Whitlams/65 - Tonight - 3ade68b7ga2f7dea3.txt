TONIGHT

You can go to bed Wednesday you’re a wanted man 
And wake up someone else 
Your oldest friends on the sweetest night 
Now even they can’t help 

And you run to stay still 
You hope your heart explodes 
Your beating wings 

Tonight is made of all the space 
In all the empty arms where lovers left their place 
Before the love had passed 

All drowning men are cowards out at sea 
She wouldn’t cry with you 
Try and be kind to yourself when you’re feeling bad 
‘Cause there’s no better way through 
And you wander down the hill 
And you’ve lost it all 
Into the sky again 

Tonight is made of all the space 
In all the empty arms where lovers left their place 
Before the love had passed.
You spin the lover’s curse 
And trapped without the words to get her to agree 
Together you’d be free 

Sometimes you got to look into the sky and become small again 
The note of a single star, it don’t matter where you are 
It’s an arrow saying goodbye, goodbye
