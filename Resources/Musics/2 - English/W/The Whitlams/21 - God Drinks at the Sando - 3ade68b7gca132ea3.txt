GOD DRINKS AT THE SANDO

He'll come in and sit by me
In the grainy light of four o'clock
He sits on his hands a lot
He's kind of nervous 

I don't think he's got much money
But he's got the time of day 

'Cause God drinks down at the Sandringham these days
Since the Shakespeare changed its name
He drinks down at the Sandringham these days
He's what we call alright around here 

Talks a bit, he likes to sit
Watches people come in and smiles
Somehow we're part of him
We nod and chat a while 

He drinks slowly like it's holy
>From a glass that always looks half full
