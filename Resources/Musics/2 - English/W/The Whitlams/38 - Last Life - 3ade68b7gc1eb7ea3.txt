LAST LIFE

Can't say anything's gonna be alright
I'll lie here and look at you on my side
Wait for night to let the earth turn
And not take anymore
Not take anymore

I must have been alright in the last life
to be lying here with you
Someone in the last life to get
this second chance with you

Can't say anyone's gonna be alright
We'll lie here and look at each other on our sides
Wait for night to let the earth turn
And not take anymore
Not take anymore

I must have been alright in the last life
to be lying here with you
Someone in the last life to get
this second chance with you

I dragged you into this hole that I fell in
I'll get us out of here again
if you believe in me

Can't say anyone's getting out of here alive
We'll lie here and look at each other on our sides
Wait for night to let the earth turn
And wait for the signs
Of life to return

Hair of the bulldog day
