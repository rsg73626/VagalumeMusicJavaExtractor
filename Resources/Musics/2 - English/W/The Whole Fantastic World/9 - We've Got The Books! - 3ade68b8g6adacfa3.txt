WE'VE GOT THE BOOKS!

Is this the right tie?
I’ve got to look so good tonight.
I’m meeting the ambassador’s friends
Are my teeth white?
It’s got to be the perfect night.
I’m meeting her mysobic friends
I think I’ll wear the ostrich skin instead.
We’re set to meet at ten.
Let's go I’ve got your medicine
My you’re looking thin.
How do you do it?
One time is all that it takes.
Which is the right wine?
If I choose wrong I’ll be crucified.
We’ll have the Chateau Lafitte ‘88
What a year for Bordeaux!
One time is all that is takes.
Two times is all…
Three times…
