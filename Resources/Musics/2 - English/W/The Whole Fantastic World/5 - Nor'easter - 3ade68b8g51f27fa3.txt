NOR'EASTER

Dated 11/19/02.
I’d gathered the post by nine.
I sat down to read it,
Curiously bent on taking its contents to mind.
I shuddered when the kettle spoke.
It read like a novel of uncertain intent.
A gentleman’s cursive for sure.
It told about the winds and pressures of our atmosphere.
It was sent by a man of science.
