FROM ASPIC TO ZOO

He swam across the channel
Parasols extended high above his head
Cautious of the animals
Who had reason to believe
They all had right to feed
Upon his failing legs

July fifth for all God’s people
A summer death for Robert Cleveland
Laid to rest in Amphitritie’s arms
Blanket church bell laughter ringing
Starting children’s choirs singing
Little tenors singing from the heart.

We will part but I’ll always keep you close to my heart

Blindly sunshine beaming
on a slightly greening garden past the car
A quiet summer evening
Gently being drowned by a thousand worker’s sounds
In the sweetest labor

Keeping bees was just a hobby
Although the honey was good for his body
A lonely life but it helped sustain his art
Although the bees won’t be receiving
Further keeping from Mr. Cleveland
They’ll continue each to do their part

We will part but I‘ll always keep you close to my heart
Everyday people returning back to that from which they came
Understand things couldn’t be any other way
A summer’s night contently sinking through the deep without a fight
Doing his part helping nature restore order through its art.
