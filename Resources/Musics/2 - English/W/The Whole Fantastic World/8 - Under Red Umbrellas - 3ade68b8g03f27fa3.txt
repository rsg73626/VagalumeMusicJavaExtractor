UNDER RED UMBRELLAS

"How have you made out?
Was it everything youÂ’d hoped?
I noticed when you left,
You left something behind.
Did it lack that lustrous shine?"

"IÂ’m surprised it outlasted the season.
Still, I see youÂ’ve found a reason to move on.
WhatÂ’s wrong?
Was it not everything youÂ’d imagined?
When will we learn that this idea of grow or perish can harm?
The larger we build it the sooner we realize our resources are gone."
Graffiti voices demonstrate a cause for alarm.
The wiser heed warnings.

"IÂ’m surprised it outlasted the season.
Still, I see youÂ’ve found a reason to move on.
Ou non, attend."

"Under red umbrellas IÂ’ve been told my skin looks brighter."
