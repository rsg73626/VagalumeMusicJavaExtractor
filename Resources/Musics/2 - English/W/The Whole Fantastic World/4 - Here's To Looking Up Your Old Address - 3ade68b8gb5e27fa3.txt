HERE'S TO LOOKING UP YOUR OLD ADDRESS

Some officious member of the bank
Spotted Dreary as she passed the tank.
His whole life.
Her last night.

Dreary wiped a tear across her eye.
For such a tough girl she sure did cry.
Her whole life.
Her last night.

Dreary think it over, this time.

All too polite,
She raised up her arms and released it.
All the while.
Breaking her legs just to meet me.

Dreary think it over this time.

As she made her way out of the bank,
To see a sea of Turinâ€™s finest steady their aim,
With one shot.
Her last night.

Dreary think it over, this time.
