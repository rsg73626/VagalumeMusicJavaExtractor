OSIEKI

From office chairs and chartered flights,
behind our desk’s day and night,
all winning small victories.
On fishing boats and playing fields,
with single strokes and daily builds,
all winning small victories.
Ooo.
In hotel bars and future cars,
in factories and aging streets,
all of us winning small victories.
But like all of those who came before,
these battles will not win the war,
all of us leading these vacant lives.
Ooo…
