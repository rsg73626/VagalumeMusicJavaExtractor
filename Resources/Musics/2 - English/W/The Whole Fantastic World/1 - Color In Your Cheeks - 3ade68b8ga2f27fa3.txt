COLOR IN YOUR CHEEKS

Suddenly as she lay reading,
Arthur burst in, one hand on his chest, catching up with his breathing.
"Follow me, you'll never believe it.
Pull yourself up El, Anna's arrived escorting Stephen"
Arthur, I beg you my love,
a moment's peace.
you're so exciteable."
"Who's this i hear? Eloise you look so nice. Goodness dear, pull your nose from that book.
For someone so meek you'd do well to exercise. A little color in your cheeks might be nice."
"Anna, I beg you my love.
a moment's peace.
you're so excitable."
