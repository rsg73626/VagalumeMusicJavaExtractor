TAKE ME DOWN

I once woke up
And I felt
Like rising hope
When I see
The light
Shine down on me
I like to be

In the summer
Breeze
Trying to keep
The strength in me
Light of day
And death
Of night
Fire and ice

I knew you where
Gonna take me down
OOh noo!
You are gonna take me down
I felt alone
I was going down
In the dark
Always feeling scared

It's so unfair
You make me
Feel this way
I need to turn
It all around
Light of day
And death
Of night
Fire and ice

I knew you where
Gonna take me down
OOh noo!
You are gonna take me down
I knew you where
Gonna take me down
OOh noo!
You are gonna take me down

I can't take this pressure
Anymore
Must have hope
I can't give up
Staring down at
Broken glass
I'm alive
And I'll survive

I knew you where
Gonna take me down
OOh noo!
You are gonna take me down
I knew you where
Gonna take me down
OOh noo!
You are gonna take me down
