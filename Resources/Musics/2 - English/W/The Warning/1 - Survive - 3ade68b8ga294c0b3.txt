SURVIVE

Don't come to me saying that you cared
That I was the one who was never there
Don't come with your lies in the air
You keep blaming me and it ain't fair
Don't come telling me that you worried
That I'll be hurting if you're gone
Don't come to me saying that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing
Your words mean nothing at all

You said that we were gonna be together
Forever and ever
But now I'm lying on the floor
With my broken heart and all

You said that I was the one of your dreams
That your heart belong to me
Now I believe I must move on
Because I think you won't come home
Come home

Oh I know I will survive
Even if you're not by my side
Think this time I'll say goodbye

Don't come to me saying that you cared
That I was the one who was never there
Don't come with your lies in the air
You keep blaming me and it ain't fair
Don't come telling me that you worried
That I'll be hurting if you're gone
Don't come to me saying that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing
Your words mean nothing at all

You said that we were perfect for each other
That I was like no other
I never knew this was a game
And when I lose I'd be replaced

You said that you were gonna keep your promise
Of loving me always
But now I know that it ain't true
And I'm so glad that I left you, left you

Oh I know I will survive
Even if you're not by my side
Think this time I'll say goodbye

Don't come to me saying that you cared
That I was the one who was never there
Don't come with your lies in the air
You keep blaming me and it ain't fair
Don't come telling me that you worried
That I'll be hurting if you're gone
Don't come to me saying that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing
Your words mean nothing at all
