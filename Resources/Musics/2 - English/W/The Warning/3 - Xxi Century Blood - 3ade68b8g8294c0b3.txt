XXI CENTURY BLOOD

We're the new generation
Lost our salvation
Another problem to be solved
We ÃÅre the groundbreakers honey living for the money
21st century blood
Immortal souls dying
Empires are falling
We are just waiting to be crushed
Politicians trying but we know they're lying
Every truth has been sold

Eah eh eh eh yeah eh eh eh eh

We make buildings
When what we need are bridges
We are stuck within these walls
Everyone with blank faces
Trying to fill the blank spaces
That we left a long time ago

Yeah! Yeah!
What will our future hold?
Will we regret our addiction to the rush
Yeah! Yeah!
We've always been crazy so
Let's fly away
And roam through the world
that is slowly burning in the flames

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

Everyone's in depression because of an obsession
With stereotypes around the world
Worldwide starvation
But in this situation
No one seems to care at all

Our communication
Replaced by animation
Television has control
Every question answered internet demands us
To worship it like a God

Yeah! Yeah!
What will our future hold?
Will we regret our addiction to the rush
Yeah! Yeah!
We've always been crazy so
Let's fly away
And roam through the world
that is slowly burning in the flames
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

Yeah! Yeah!
What will our future hold?
Will we regret our addiction to the rush
Yeah! Yeah!
We've always been crazy so
Let's fly away
And roam through the world that is slowly
burning in the flames
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh yeaah
