SUPERSTAR

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Marty McIntosh)

She left Arizona like her father had before
She took a bus cause she hated planes
She prayed the trip would ease her pain
And lead to open doors
She landed out in Nashville
And she taught herself to play
Cause country was the music that her daddy loved
And she thought it might bring him back someday

La de da, la de da
Here comes another superstar 
La de da, la de da
Here comes another superstar

She fell for a producer with a wife back in LA
She knew that she was wrong but she needed him
To get her songs to the man at RCA
Her first cut went top 40
And the next went number one
Even though she felt the same before the
Fortune and the fame
The papers all said she was having fun

La de da, la de da
Here comes another superstar 
La de da, la de da
Here comes another superstar

She never found the answers, 
She never really asked
So she just numbed it all with money, drugs,
and alcohol
Sacrificed the future for the past

La de da, la de da
There goes another superstar 
La de da, la de da
There goes another superstar
La de da, la de da
Who wants to be a superstar 
La de da, la de da
Here comes another superstar, a superstar

Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,
Whoa, Baby there she goes, another one
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,
Oh, there she goes baby
