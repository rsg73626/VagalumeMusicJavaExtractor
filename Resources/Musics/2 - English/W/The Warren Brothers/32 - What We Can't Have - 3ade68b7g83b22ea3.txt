WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren)

Itâ€™s a small crowd here again tonight
Iâ€™m playing these old songs I write
Nobodyâ€™s listening but a rich guy in the corner booth
And I think Iâ€™d like to be just like him
To get off work before two a.m.
Order what I like and dress real smooth

And then the rich guy he comes up to me
Picks up the tip jar and drops a twenty
And says â€That last song it really hit homeâ€
He said â€If I could have just one thing 
I would play guitar and sing
and then Iâ€™d never really feel aloneâ€
And I thought to myself

We all want what we canâ€™t have
Itâ€™s enough to drive you mad
Make you happy, make you sad
Ainâ€™t it crazy
We all want what we canâ€™t have

Businessman sits at the bar
Lights up the end of a cigarr 
And says â€Bartender, pour me one more Crownâ€
He says â€I should be getting home tonight
Iâ€™ve got two kids and a wife
But you know me, Iâ€™d like to stick aroundâ€

And Bartender says â€If I were you, Iâ€™d get out of here
Iâ€™m tired of selling wine and beer
Iâ€™d sure love something nine to five.
No wife no kids no place to be
You sure you want to be like me
It feels like I have been here all my lifeâ€

We all want what we canâ€™t have
Itâ€™s enough to drive you mad
Make you happy, make you sad
Ainâ€™t it crazy
We all want what we canâ€™t have

Thank God for this old guitar
I wrote a song for a country star
Made enough money to leave this little stage
But I come back here every now and then
I love this new guy sitting in
Heâ€™s probably half my age

We all want what we canâ€™t have
Itâ€™s enough to drive you mad
Make you happy, make you sad
Ainâ€™t it crazy
We all want what we canâ€™t have

Itâ€™s enough to drive you mad
Make you happy, make you sad
Ainâ€™t it crazy
We all want what we canâ€™t have

Baby ainâ€™t it crazy
We all want what we canâ€™t have
Baby ainâ€™t it crazy
Baby ainâ€™t it crazy
Oooh, na na na na na
We all want what we canâ€™t have
We all want what we canâ€™t have
