THE ONE I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT

Yes I 've been with someone new
She's a good woman too
But she can't compare to you
Chorus:
The more time that I spend with her
The more I see what it's about
She's someone I can live with
but you're the one that
I can't live without
She has brown eyes like you
Picks me up when I'm feelin' blue
Showers me with her love
But somehow it's not enough
Chorus
I know we said it's over
But I just can't let you go
'cause no one compares to you
Chorus
The more time that I spend with her
The more I see what it's about
She's someone I can live with
You're the one that I can't live without
You're the one that I can't live without
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
