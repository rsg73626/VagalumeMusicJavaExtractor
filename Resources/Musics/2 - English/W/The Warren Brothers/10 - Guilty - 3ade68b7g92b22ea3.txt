GUILTY

I don't want nothin' serious
and you said I understand
no commitment that's for sure
I always need that open door
that's just the way I am
Chorus:
Now you say I can't make it babe without you
Is that how you see it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you go I won't know how to forget about you
Is that how you believe it to be true
If you're accusing me of needing your sweet touch
Accusing me of loving you too much
Guilty
Yeah, yeah, I'm guilty
And I never thought there'd be someone
Who could ever do what you've done
Oh baby how'd you do it
You broke the walls around
This heart you turned upside down
Like there was nothing to it
Chorus
If you're accusing me of needing your sweet touch
Accusing me of loving you too much
Now you say I can't make it babe without you
Guilty
And if you go I won't know how to forget about you
Guilty
You say my arms need to be around you
Guilty
And you say I never knew love 'til I found you
Oh baby, I'm guilty
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm guilty
Yeah, yeah, yeah
