ENEMY

I know it's true but I guess nobody has to tell you
I don't always listen and I talk too much
I think I'm in tune when I'm out of touch
Baby
Don't tell me I've done it again
There's a tear on your face with my name on it
And at this moment it must be hard to see
but I am not the enemy
Chorus:
Lay your defenses down
I'll put my arms around you
put your arms around me
Baby I'm on your side
Someday I'll get it right
How can I make you see
I'm not the enemy
I don't call when I'm comin' home late
And there's three little words that are hard for me to say
I'm not so good at all those little things
But baby I am not the enemy
Chorus
Lay your defenses down
This ain' no battleground
How can I make you see
I am not the enemy
