SURVIVING EMILY LYRICS

Beyond the cost of diesel fuel
And the tearing down of my old high school
I still think about her
The nation's rising deficit
And my fatal crave for cigarettes
They all make me think about her

CHORUS:
My life's one big catastrophe
So don't expect too much from me
I'm just hanging on, surviving Emily

My t-shirt that she always wore
Her makeup in the bathroom drawer
I can't get away from her
Her perfume on my pillowcase
When I close my eyes,
I always see her face
Sometimes I wish I were blind

CHORUS

Emily can you hear me
I'm callin' out your name
Rescue me from these lonely days and sleepless nights
They're driving me insane

I tried to stop this endless search
Even started going back to church
But I still feel the same
and my friends all say I'm doing fine
It's just gonna take a little time
Yeah nothing's changed

My life's one big catastrophe
So don't expect too much from me
I'm just hanging on
Surviving
Just hanging on
Surviving
I'm barely hanging on
Surviving Emily
