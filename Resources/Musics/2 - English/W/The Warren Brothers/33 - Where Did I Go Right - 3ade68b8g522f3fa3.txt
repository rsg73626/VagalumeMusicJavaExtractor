WHERE DID I GO RIGHT

We all make decisions, and some you've got to live with
And some you just pretend they don't exist
Me I've made some bad ones, in the name of havin' fun
You pay the price it's just the way it is
When I look back on my life I think 
Where did I go right?

I've never been to prison, but sometimes the way I'm livin'
Feels like a cage is wrapped around my soul
The problem of problems, sometimes you just can't solve them
And if you've never lived you'd never know
You're still here with me tonight
Where did I go right?

How'd I dodge the bullets, with my name on every one
When better man than me haven't had my love

Oh I've hurt the ones that love me, and love the ones that hurt me
I'm trying hard to be somebody else
Where the road was leading, it had no rhyme or reason
There were times I stopped believin' in myself
But I'm still singing here tonight, 
Where did I go right?
Where did I go right?
