NO PLACE TO GO

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Marc Jordan)

Why you wearing that dress
With your hair all down
Are you meeting some friends
Mind if I come

Will you be home late
Again tonight
That nothing youâ€™re doing
Sure takes a long time

Nobody jumps
With no place to fall
Nobody runs
Before they can crawl
When you walk out that door
Baby I know
Nobody leaves
With no place to go

Youâ€™re taxiâ€™s waiting out in the drive
We said if this happened
Baby weâ€™d never lie
Now Iâ€™ve been here before
All by myself
But thatâ€™s when I believed
There wasnâ€™t anybody else

Nobody jumps
With no place to fall
Nobody runs
Before they can crawl
When you walk out that door
Baby I know
Nobody leaves
With no place to go

So baby keep running from the simple truth
But I wonâ€™t be waiting when heâ€™s leaving you

Nobody jumps
With no place to fall
Nobody runs
Before they can crawl
When you walk out that door
Baby I know
Nobody leaves
With no place to go

Nobody leaves baby
With no place to go
Nobody leaves baby
