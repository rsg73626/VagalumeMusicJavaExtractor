RUNNIN OUT OF HEROS

Gotham heard the news today
Batman up and moved away
He said he couldn’t bare to stay
In a lonely cave no more

The Daily Planet pitted Lois Lane
Had to get an order to restrain
Less than Superman who went insane
When she said she needed more
Walked right out the door

I guess I really need
Something I can see, something I can hold
Someone to hold me
I’m sorry if it scares you
That I need to be rescued
But you’re my only hope
‘Cause I’m runnin’ out of heroes

Always thought that I could be John Wayne
Come sunset I’d sweep you away
But I don’t feel much like him today
I can’t fake it anymore
The way I did before

I guess I really need
Something I can see, something I can hold
Someone to hold me
I’m sorry if it scares you
That I need to be rescued
But you’re my only hope
‘Cause I’m runnin’ out of heroes

I guess I really need
Something I can see, something I can hold
Someone to hold me
I guess I’m trying to say
You’re the only way
You’re the only one
Who could come and save the day
I’m sorry if it scares you
That I need to be rescued
But you’re my only hope
‘Cause I’m runnin’ out of heroes

Runnin’ out of heroes
Yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yea

Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
