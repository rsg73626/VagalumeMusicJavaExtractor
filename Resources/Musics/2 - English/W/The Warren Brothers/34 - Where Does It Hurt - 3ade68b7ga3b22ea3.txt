WHERE DOES IT HURT

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Tom Douglas)

Every Saturday night
I watched Roy Rogers on TV
Back when everything was black and white
And easy to see
But now everything has changed
Except my memory
Of my daddyâ€™s voice when Iâ€™d fall
And skin my knee

Tell me where does it hurt
Where is the pain
You know if I could Iâ€™d make it go away
Itâ€™s not the end of the world
Not heaven on earth
Did I make it better
Where does it hurt

Itâ€™s thirty years later
And my little girl sheâ€™s not quiet grown
In tears she calls me up one night
Says Iâ€™m gonna have a child of my own
And the boy that I love
Daddy heâ€™s gone away
And of the million things that ran
through my mind
Only one I can say

Tell me where does it hurt
Where is the pain
You know if I could Iâ€™d make it go away
Itâ€™s not the end of the world
Not heaven on earth
Can I make it better
Where does it hurt

My headâ€™s turninâ€™ gray
And I walk really slow
And itâ€™s harder to see, and get by on my own
And I wonder if anything Iâ€™ve said has
ever meant anything
And my daugther says those healing
words to me

Tell me where does it hurt
Where is the pain
You know if I could Iâ€™d make it go away
Itâ€™s not the end of the world
Not heaven on earth
Can I make it better
Oh, where does it hurt

Itâ€™s not the end of the world
Can I make it better
Where does it hurt
