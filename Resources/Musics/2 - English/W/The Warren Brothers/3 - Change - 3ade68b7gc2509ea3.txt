CHANGE

Went to see a shrink 
Cause my life is such a mess
Thanks Mr Freud
Now I'm broke and depressed
I had to start smoking to get off Nicorette
I put the top down just in time to get wet

One of these days my luck is gonna change
They'll think I'm brillant instead of insane
Everything will be different
But I'll be the same
One of these days my luck is gonna change

Bought a new shirt as it was going out of style
Stood up a blind date
It was Nicki Dial
Bought a message so i could relax
Big man massuse almost broke my back

One of these days my luck is gonna change
They'll think I'm brillant instead of insane
Everything will be different
But I'll be the same
One of these days my luck is gonna change

Stand in line pass the time
Live and learn wait my turn

One of these days my luck is gonna change
They'll think I'm brillant instead of insane
Everything will be different
But I'll be the same
One of these days 
One of these days my luck is gonna change
They'll think I'm brillant instead of insane
Everything will be different
But I'll be the same
One of these days my luck is gonna change

ahh could you spare a little....change
