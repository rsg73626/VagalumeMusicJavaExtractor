MOVE ON

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Danny Wilde)

Weâ€™re wastinâ€™ all our time and energy it seems
To mend our broken hearts as if they were machines
There ainâ€™t a tool around that could make us tight

Hell I donâ€™t know where all the good times went
Had a pocket full of love now there ainâ€™t nothinâ€™ left but lint
A handful of good times donâ€™t make it right

So move on
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces donâ€™t fit 
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it
So move on

Youâ€™ve got to be you and baby Iâ€™ve got to be me
And I donâ€™t wanna stay just because I donâ€™t wanna leave
I got one foot out the door
I got one foot in my mouth

Weâ€™re always sayinâ€™ things that we donâ€™t really mean
Like I love you and Iâ€™ll be with you for all eternity
We donâ€™t have that long to work this out

So move on
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces donâ€™t fit 
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it

And I tried to find the answers
And Iâ€™ve read all the books
Watched all the daytime shows
Sometimes weâ€™re the victims
Sometimes weâ€™re the crooks
Thatâ€™s just the way it goes
Oh, yeah

So move on
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces donâ€™t fit 
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do
So move on
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it
Come on
Love is like a puzzle when the pieces donâ€™t fit 
There ainâ€™t nothing you can do about it
Move on
Move on
Just move on
