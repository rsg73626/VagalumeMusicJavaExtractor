DO-YA

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Bob Dipiero)

Iâ€™m tired of waking up every morning without you
And you thinking Iâ€™m down with it
Normally Iâ€™d try to choose my words carefully
But today I ainâ€™t gonna fool with it

I ainâ€™t ashamed, I ainâ€™t afraid
To tell you how Iâ€™m feeling
I gotta know, you gotta show me
The hand youâ€™re dealinâ€™

Do you love me, do you want me, do you need me
Like I love you, like I want you, like I need you
Come on and tell me
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya

Every man likes a game of hard to get
Every once in a while
But Iâ€™ve been waiting so long for an answer
My clothes are almost back in style

Iâ€™m holdinâ€™ on, youâ€™re holdinâ€™ out
And Iâ€™ve just gotta know
Tell me yes, tell me maybe
But baby donâ€™t tell me no

Do you love me, do you want me, do you need me
Like I love you, like I want you, like I need you
Come on and tell me
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
Come on now

Tell me yes, tell me maybe
But baby donâ€™t tell me no

Do you love me, do you want me, do you need me
Like I love you, like I want you, like I need you
Come on and tell me now
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
Oh, yeah
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
Do-ya, Do-ya, Do-ya
