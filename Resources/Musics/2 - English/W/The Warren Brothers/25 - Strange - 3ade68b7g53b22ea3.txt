STRANGE

(Brett James/Troy Verges)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well I headed to Atlanta for the weekend
Just to step out of my boring little life
I was going to my best friendâ€™s brothersâ€™ wedding
Thought Iâ€™d eat and drink for free for just one night

I was sittinâ€™ in the pew behind the Grandmas
When the bridesmaids all came walkinâ€™ down the aisle
She was the second from the last I still remember
Because I knew Iâ€™d seen forever in her smile

Oh, life all comes down to a couple of moments
When just like that everything can change
You open up your eyes and in an instant
Nothing will ever be the same
Ainâ€™t life strange
Ainâ€™t it strange

We had a wedding of our own that next December
Somehow I made that little bridesmaid my bride
I guess no one really ever sees the future
Oh but you can just imagine my surprise
When nine months later we were down at the County General
We were watching little Liza join the world
Well Iâ€™m not sure but I think I might have kissed the doctor
When he said congratulations Daddy itâ€™s a girl

Oh, life all comes down to a couple of moments
When just like that everything can change
You open up your eyes and in an instant
Nothing will ever be the same
Ainâ€™t life strange
Ainâ€™t it strange

I said life all comes down to a couple of moments
When just like that everything can change
You open up your eyes and in an instant
Nothing will ever be the same
Ainâ€™t life strange
Ainâ€™t it strange

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ainâ€™t life strange, baby
