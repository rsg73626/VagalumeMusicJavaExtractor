I TRIED

You say you're alone when
you're with me
and I don't care about the way
you feel inside
You say the weight's all on
your shoulders
Baby you say I never tried

CHORUS:
But I tried runnin' from the way
I feel about you
and I tried walkin' away from
all the lies
I tried leavin' but I couldn't live
without you
and I never said goodbye
But baby I tried

We judge ourselves by our intentions
and others by the way
they live their lives
I always meant to do the right thing
how can you say that I never tried,
'cause

CHORUS

Baby I tried

Whatever it is about you
keeps pullin' me back into your web
I can't put my finger on it
Whatever it is I ain't figured
it out yet

CHORUS

Baby I tried
