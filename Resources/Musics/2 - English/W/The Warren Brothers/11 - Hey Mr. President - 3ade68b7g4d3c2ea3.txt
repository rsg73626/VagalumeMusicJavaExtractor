HEY MR. PRESIDENT

(Tom Douglas)

Hey, Mr President I don't think I'd want your job
I can barely handle the simple one I got
Hey, Mr President how cool is Air Force One?
Are those guys in the House and The Senate ever gonna get anything done?

I ain't no Democrat,I ain't no Republican
We're fathers and mothers we're wives and husbands
And we pray that we dance at our daughter's weddings
And our sons grow to fine men
And for peace on our land

Hey, Mr President how about that money I sent
Must take a lot of pork barrels to run the government
And hey, Mr President our kids in the middle east
I guess you gotta fight sometimes to find a way to keep the peace

I ain't no Democrat,I ain't no Republican
We're fathers and mothers,sisters and brothers,wives and husbands
And we pray that we dance at our daughters weddings
And our sons grow to fine men
And for peace on our land

I cannot imagine how hard it must be
To tell some soldiers mother
That they died for their country
Mr President won't you thank her for me

Hey Mr President do you ever feel alone
Surrounded by all those ghosts in the White House
Bet you wish you could move back home

We ain't just Democrats,we ain't just Republicans
It's all for one and one for all were Americans
And we pray that we see our children's children
And our sons grow to old men
And for peace
Yeah, peace on our land

Hey, Mr President
