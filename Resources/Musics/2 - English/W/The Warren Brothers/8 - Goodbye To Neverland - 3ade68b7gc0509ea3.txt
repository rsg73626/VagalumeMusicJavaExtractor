GOODBYE TO NEVERLAND

There is a map that I once followed
Its all in pieces on the ground
Times are drug and cant say no two
Love is a treasure seldom found
Youre the hand that I was holding
But you slowly pulled away
There were words I contemplated
Never had the guts to say

Ohh ohh goodbye to neverland
Im sailing off into reality
If theres good in every man
I wonder if theres any good in me

Youre the song that I was singing
But I lost the melody
Hate to leave it so unfinished
Thats how its gotta be

Ohh ohh goodbye to neverland
Im sailing off nito reality
Theres good in every man
I wonder if theres any good in me

Theres a time when we were flying
High above the winds of change
Lookin up I cant help thinkin
The world will never be the same

Ohh ohh goodbye to neverland
Im sailing off into reality
If theres good in every man
I wonder if theres any good in me

Goodbye 
Goodbye
Goodbye to neverland, yeah
if theres good in everyman
I wonder if theres any good in me
