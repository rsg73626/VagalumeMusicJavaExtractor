KING OF NOTHING

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/James House)

I live in this castle all alone
I must have built these walls with a heart of stone
Whoa canâ€™t you see
Whoa what youâ€™re doing to me

Iâ€™m standinâ€™ on top of the world tonight
But I feel like jumpinâ€™
I had it all when I had you in my life
But now that youâ€™re runninâ€™
Without your love Iâ€™m the king of nothing

I got a lot of things money can buy
Iâ€™d sell them all just to get you off my mind baby
Whoa canâ€™t you see
Whoa what youâ€™re doing to me

Iâ€™m standinâ€™ on top of the world tonight
But I feel like jumpinâ€™
I had it all when I had you in my life
But now that youâ€™re runninâ€™
Without your love Iâ€™m the king of nothing

Whoa canâ€™t you see
Whoa what youâ€™re doing to me

Iâ€™m standinâ€™ on top of the world tonight
But I feel like jumpinâ€™
I had it all when I had you in my life
But now that youâ€™re runninâ€™
Without your love Iâ€™m the king of nothing

Without youâ€™re love baby
Oh, Iâ€™m nothing
Iâ€™m the king of nothing my baby
Without your love baby
Ooh baby
