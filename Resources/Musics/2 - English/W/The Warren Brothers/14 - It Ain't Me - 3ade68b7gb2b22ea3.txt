IT AIN'T ME

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Rob Stoney)

Youâ€™re Daddyâ€™s little girl
Born with a silver spoon
I could tell somebody told you 
you hung the moon
You look so good I had to look the other way
You need a man thatâ€™ll do everything you say

I know baby what you need
I know baby what you need
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
It ainâ€™t me

At first you were different
Actinâ€™ like the shy type
You blew it baby you blamed it on the wine
I should have known that was the beginning of the end
But I took you back baby you did it all over again

I know baby what you need
I know baby what you need
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
It ainâ€™t me

You donâ€™t think Iâ€™d leave you standing in the rain
Girl you think my love for you itâ€™ll never change
Oh, no, no, no
It used to be enough drinkinâ€™ from your lovinâ€™ cup
But tonight itâ€™s really over
So shut up and get out of my truck

I know baby what you need
I know baby what you need
I know ba-ba-ba-baby what you need
Yeah I know baby what you need
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, yeah
It ainâ€™t me
