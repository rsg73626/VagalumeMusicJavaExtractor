SELL A LOT OF BEER

My name ain't up in lights
But I'm a hero in this bar
And I play four big shows a night
With just me and my guitar
I don't make a lot of money
And I don't have a lot of gear
I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

If you wanna hear Bob Dillon
I'll play like a Rollin' Stone
If you wanna hear Bob Wills
I'll play the Rose of San Antone
I'll even play Happy Birthday
If that's what you wanna hear
Cause I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

Chorus
So it's hey hey what's your favorite song?
Hey hey everybody sing along
We're just one big red neck family
Aw, at least while we're in here
Cause I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

I wake up every Sunday morning
So I can go to church and pray
But after some of my Saturday nights
Things just don't turn out that way
I think even the Good Lord, he understands
I'm at that point in my career
Where I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

Chorus
So it's hey hey what's your favorite song?
Hey hey everybody sing along
We're just one big red neck family
Aw, at least while we're in here
Cause I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

I don't sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer
