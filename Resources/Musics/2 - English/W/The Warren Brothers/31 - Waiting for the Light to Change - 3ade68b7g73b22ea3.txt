WAITING FOR THE LIGHT TO CHANGE

(Brett Warren/Brad Warren/Benmont Tench)

Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ in car in southern California
Just like I do every day
Thinkinâ€™ â€™bout my life
And waiting for the light to change
Told her I was leavinâ€™
She said I donâ€™t believe you
Thatâ€™s what you always say
Now Iâ€™m gonna prove her wrong
Iâ€™m just waiting for the light to change

Just outside my window
The world keeps rolling by
It makes me think of whatâ€™s ahead
And what Iâ€™d leave behind

I was all but gone when I heard
her favorite song
Cominâ€™ down those radio waves
Now itâ€™s getting harder
Waiting for the light to change

Just outside my window
The world keeps rolling by
It makes me think of whatâ€™s ahead
And what Iâ€™d leave behind

Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ in car in southern California
Just like I do every day
Thinkinâ€™ â€™bout my life
Whether I should go or stay
Guess Iâ€™ll turn this car around
Iâ€™m just waiting for the light to change
