DEAR MR. GOD

Dear Mr. God,
I'm writin' You today
Because it seems like lately
I've forgotten how to pray
I know I don't need this pen
Everybody likes to get
A letter now and then
I'm sorry for not writin' more

Chorus:
'Cause I need you
But it's hard to see
Why anyone as big as You
Needs anything from me
I know You're there
So how ya been?
I'm alright but I can't lie,
Sometimes I feel like givin' in
You're all I've got

Dear Mr. God,
Sometimes I wish
You lived next door
So over coffee You could tell me
What You started all this for
I guess you saw
That sunrise yesterday
Thanks for the reminder
That You're never gone away
It gives me hope
Telling You what You already know

I need you
But it's hard to see
Why anyone as big as you
Needs anything from me
I know You're there
So how've You Been?
I'm all right but I can't lie
Sometimes I feel like givin' in

Dear Mr. God,
Tell me do You ever cry
When we forget to thank You
For the good things in our lives?
I know I can't always understand
Why You do the things You do
But I know in the end
I'll make it through
If I stand next to You
So here I am

Dear Mr. God,
I'm writin' you today
Because it seems like lately
I've forgotten how to pray
