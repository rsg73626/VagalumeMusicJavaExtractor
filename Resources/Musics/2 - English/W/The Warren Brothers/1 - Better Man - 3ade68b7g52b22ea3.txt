BETTER MAN

I saw some old friends the other day
And all they could talk about was how I've changed
They thought I'd be the last one to ever settle down
They can't believe I'm flyin' so high with both feet on the ground

Chorus:
And you make me wanna be a better man
And you make me wanna be the best I can
I feel a little stronger every time you hold my hand
You make me wanna be a better man

Now there was a time when I ran wild as a Texas wind
Never slowin' down enough to ever let that party end
Woah, then your love surrounded me like the shelter from the storm
Woah baby you believed in me like noone has before...

Chorus:
And you make me wanna be a better man
And you make me wanna do the best I can
I feel a little stronger every time you hold my hand
You make me wanna be a better man

Well you know sometimes I stumble...
Yeah, everybody does
But you keep me reaching for the man I can be...
And not the man I was, no

I feel a little stronger every time you hold my hand
You make me wanna be a better man, oh baby
You make me wanna be a better man
