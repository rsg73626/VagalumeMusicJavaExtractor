SANCTUARY

When we begin
We're all looking for the promise land
And in the end
We just need someone to hold our hands

Everybody needs some kind of refuge
Something to run to
Someone who loves you

I'll be the light guiding you through the night
When the stars just refuse to shine
And I'll be your shelter that safe place to hide
Your sanctuary

When I look at you
There is a strength in your eyes shining through
There will be days
When even the strong ones need shelter too
Honey let me shelter you

Everybody needs some kind of refuge
Someone to run to
Someone who loves you

I'll be the light guiding you through the night
When the stars just refuse to shine
And I'll be your shelter that safe place to hide
Your sanctuary
I'll be your sanctuary

I'll be the river when your lips are dry
The water that keeps you alive
I'll be your shelter that safe place to hide
Your sanctuary
I'll be the light guiding you through the night
When the stars just refuse to shine
And I'll be your shelter that safe place to hide
Your sanctuary
I'll be your sanctuary
I'll be your sanctuary

Cuz everybody needs some kind of refuge
Something to run to
