THE HIGHEST TIDE

If you knew me back when I was younger
The world at my feet was what mattered
Oh well I thought everything it was beautiful
And I loved you much like a mother
If you merely is the thing I've been needing
Well I've got enough to last
Maybe it's time that
I tried something dangerous

Only if you have my back
During the highest tide
While the water is rising
Will you still keep me in your side?
All I want is to feel my heart beating
I'm beating it to death
I remember when running forever
Was the only escape I could get
If only I knew what that meant

During the highest tide
While the water is rising
Will you still keep me in your side?
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh

During the highest tide
While the water is rising
Will you still keep me in your side?
During the highest tide
While the water is rising
Will you still keep me in your side?
During the highest tide
While the water is rising
Will you still keep me in your side?
