CAPABLE

He says, "you're awful young for 21
You've got some work to do
Bite your pencil harder than
You were planning to"

"you daydream slow, you sleep too quick
You need a sharper view
There's much more out there than someone
Who's lying next to you"

He said, "you're capable of so much more
Than these people give you credit for
And you just need to show it"

Growing up was not an easy movement for me
You nudge and nudge
You push and shove
And I might still stay asleep

And it's a struggle to think on my feet
I fear the harsh regard
But friend, if you'd encourage me
I know I'd make it far

You said I'm capable of so much more
Than these people give me credit for
And I just need to show it

And my anger surrounds me
Like a coat when I shiver
I let it surround me with
These thoughts often so bitter
But friend, if you'd help me
I think I'd make it through this winter

You said I'm capable of so much more
Than these people give me credit for
And I just need to show it

Oh, I'm capable of so much more
Than you people give me credit for
And I just need to show it
