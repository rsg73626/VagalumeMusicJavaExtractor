EVERYTHING LOOKS BETTER IN HINDSIGHT

When you wake up in the morning
Are you lonely
To find only the items I had left

By your bedside
On the table to your right hand
Little traces are the proof that I exist

Looking back now I can see
Your clear green eyes
In that old shed with
The string lights you reside
With the swing set stuck
Above you in the rafters
And the books and the records on each side
And the books and the records on each side

I knew I could grow to love him
But his walls came up too fast
I was strong in his presence
But he left me for the past
Now will he ever stop haunting me
And let me go

My mind should lose their memories
My mind should lose their memories
I only remember the sweetest of things
I only remember the sweetest things

Keep her close now
Keep her happy, keep her wanting
Don't desert now the way that you did me
Cook her breakfast
Share your music, tell your secrets
Give it all like you never plan to leave
Oh did you plan to leave

And I tell your friends it was easier then
To give your heart away
Before it all became broken and eager to love
I gave it all with hate
So if you're telling your story
Especially of heart ache
It better ring out true
To pass down your blood line
And travel through song
In an honest remembrence of you

Cause I knew I could grow to love him
But his walls came up too fast
I was so strong in his presence
But he left me for his past
Now will he ever stop haunting
And let me go
Will he ever say goodbye to me
I've been on my own

So when you wake up in the morning
Are you lonely
To find only the love that you had left
By my bedside on the table to my left hand
Little traces are the proof that you exist
