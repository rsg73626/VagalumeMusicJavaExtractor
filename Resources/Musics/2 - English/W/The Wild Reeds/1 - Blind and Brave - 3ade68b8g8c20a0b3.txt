BLIND AND BRAVE

What's the difference between
night and day besides the people
that come and the people who stay
the feeling of love
and the feeling of hate
the big light in the sky and the darkness of age
the time that is passed
and the time that you wait

You really must love it all
don't go out at night
don't walk down that lane
the people from this place
they're all afraid
but you are new here
so blind and so brave

so you'll see the lights
and you'll hear the parade
so go join their call
indulge in their praise

do it 'cause you love it all
do it 'cause you love this city
'cause you love it all
do it 'cause you love this city
'cause you love it all
well you really must love it all

I won't waste your time
and I won't rid you of your pride
if you don't rid me of mine
yeah if you don't rid me of mine
I ain't moving out I ain't moving on
my feet are on the ground
hear the voices of the young

do it 'cause you love it all
do it 'cause you love this city
you showed me how to love it all
