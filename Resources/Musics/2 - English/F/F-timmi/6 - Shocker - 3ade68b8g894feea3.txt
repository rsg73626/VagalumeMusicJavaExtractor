SHOCKER

Well it's been so hard living here since you've been gone 
And when you left i never felt so empty 
The change of season hasn't changed me so much, cause i still want to see you. 

I'm at the bar with a beer in my hand and I'm thinking of you and a plan so I could...

Wake up and see you for awhile like it was before 
And this is a shock, but i won't let this end. 

Well i've been so tired, didn't get much sleep last night 
He picked me up and we spent all night drinking 
But if you were here then i'd go straight home tonight 
Cause nothing else mattered with you here. 

I'm at the bar with a beer in my hand and I'm thinking of you and a plan so I could...

Wake up and see you for awhile like it was before 
And this is a shock, but i won't let this end. 

The only reason I stayed here was you.
I never knew that until I met you.
I'm at the bar with a beer in my hand and I'm thinking of you and a plan so I could...
