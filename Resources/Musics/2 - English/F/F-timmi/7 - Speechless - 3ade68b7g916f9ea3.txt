SPEECHLESS

Try to speak my mind, but I am speechless,
what I've lost I've found, was maybe everything.
Then this all comes back to you with him, But maybe I could say..

Woke up cold and by myself.
That's my condition since I heard your voice.
It's alright 'cause we all know how these things end;
a little closer with your new best friend.

And I know, things can't be like they used to.
For right now, just tell me what I want to hear.

Try to speak my mind, but I am speechless,
what I've lost I've found, was maybe everything.
Then this all comes back to you with him,
But maybe I could say, "I won't let you down"

I know he's got things I don't have
Like how about everything I won't put faith in.
But maybe I could change your mind.
We always miss the ones we left behind.

And I know, things can't be like they used to.
For right now, just tell me what I want to hear.

Try to speak my mind, but I am speechless,
what I've lost I've found, was maybe everything.
Then this all comes back to you with him,
But maybe I could say, "I won't let you down"

Don't leave yet, it's too early.
What do they know? Stay the rest of the day.

Try to speak my mind, but I am speechless,
what I've lost I've found, was maybe everything.
Then this all comes back to you with him,
But maybe I could say, "I won't let you down"
