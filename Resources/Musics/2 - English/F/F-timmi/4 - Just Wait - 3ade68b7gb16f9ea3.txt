JUST WAIT

The road looks narrow tonight,
and my clock reads slow
Cause I've been drinkin now for three days straight,
To shut things out, like your voice.
And I've been holding on for,
the years to bring a change
With you it seems that nothing helps,
I can't let go...but I try

Would you listen if I said "you're killing me?"
Or did you even care at all, like I believed?
Just wait

Assume the worst you told me
Well that's what I did
Except for feeling howI feel for you
You're in my plans, forgive me
Proceed with caution right now,
cause your back's turned around
And I've been waiting for this very night,
To cut you like....you did me.

Would you listen if I said "you're killing me?"
Or did you even care at all, like I believed?
Break this bottle across your face,
just to watch you bleed.
You push me further than I'll go,
I swear just wait.

I've been thinking tonight.
Just wait.
