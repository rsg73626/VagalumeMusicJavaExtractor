HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL

I have one mouth and words just for you
so shut up and listen cause this one's for you
never again will things be the same
I left my opinion of you in the trash where i found you

feels like i lost everything that i had
and the tip of my finger points back to you
wait up, i've been following you, and i'm not scared

Things are the same, then different with you
I realize that i don't understand these changes
Never again? Well take my advice.
Decide to believe in something that is fact, not just fiction

Feels like i've lost everything that i had
and the tip of my finger points back to you
Wait up, I've been following you

Have a gun, will travel.
