SEE YOU AROUND

In certain light, you look like a ghost
from the downfall of something we never quite thought we could be
so i'll be here, just to let you know

that you should not believe me, cause i do not deserve you know
it's way too late for sorries, so i'll see you around

with arms so wide, but careful not to close
we make due with the fact that things aren't what we want them to be
and all my life, i've never let you go

And you should not believe me, cause i do not deserve you know
it's way too late for sorries, so i'll see you around again

it's a longer ride than i had planned to make
hold me close so we can make mistakes, and not plan to tell anyone
if you leave tonight, then i will still be here,
listen close to what i'm saying. What i miss most in my life

so you should just be with me, cause i'm the one who'll be around
it's too late not to miss you
