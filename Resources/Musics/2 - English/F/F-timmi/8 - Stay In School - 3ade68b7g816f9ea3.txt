STAY IN SCHOOL

Please give up to us your guilty persons
for said conduct, regarding those with purpose
You promised me we'd never fall again, yet each time i fall, it's a fall i won't forget

So i layed back and stared across my ceiling
And it's so late, but this voice keeps repeating
"Hold faith please", I placed a picture to a face
You kept us far from safe

We had our whole lives
You took back everything
We need some help to make things right, cause i'm sick
Somebody gave up, Someone can finally see
And we'll say "Who's gonna stop us now that we're on our own?"

You need to know that i did everything that you asked me to,
even though it was killing me. We had a chance that is given just once in a lifetime.
