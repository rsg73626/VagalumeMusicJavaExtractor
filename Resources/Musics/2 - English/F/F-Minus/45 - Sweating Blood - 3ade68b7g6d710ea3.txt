SWEATING BLOOD

Pressures in life seems like work
Like a job that will only get worse
So we look back and never forward
It's all better once its over
So we'll search search the past for meaning
For moments to spend our lives repeating

Dont understand
Won't ever learn
why things keep changing for the worse
We'll learn to see things one by one
With nervous endings and sweating blood

I'm all thumbs, i'm at sea, and im feeling
Half eaten, half empty
With no reason to leave or stay
Or not reason to be awake

Dont understand
Won't ever learn
why things keep changing for the worse
We'll learn to see things one by one
But until that day, ill be sweating blood

We'll learn to see things
One by one
Nervous endings and sweating blood
