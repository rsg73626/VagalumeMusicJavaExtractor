THE MIND

Destruction is the name of the game
Set your sights on everything
Delusions - walls closing in
Cross the line and back again
Disorder - your life is a mess
Slash your arms to relieve the stress
The pressure can't take anymore
Put your fist through the bathroom door

Your mind - breaking the code
Your mind - breaking away
Collapsing under its own weight

Obsession with a negative trend
Is it the beginning or is it the end 
Obsession - don't need any help
Don't need you to save me from myself
