Cheap to employ and easy to sever

Give us your guys - we'll give you relief
Give us your minds - we'll give your belief

Loyalty till the end - Thanks to your trusted friends
Quality you can depend on - brought to you by your trusted friends

We cut the deck, you're losing the game

Give us your guys we'll give you relief
Give us your minds we'll give you belief
