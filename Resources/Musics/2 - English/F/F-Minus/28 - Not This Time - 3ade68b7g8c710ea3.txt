NOT THIS TIME

Can't feel the pills no more
Put my arm through the fucking window
Brought it to the bone
Another day gone, another wasted
Let go of me...

Gimme more rights to wrong
This sick joke has gone on too long
Inflictions thier reason to live
While taking all you got to give
Let go of me...

*Not this time. Im too busy living my life
The day is already cold, tommorow's getting old

They say They're gonna make me pay
Say they got what i need
Spent all i have to spend
Time to throw it all away
