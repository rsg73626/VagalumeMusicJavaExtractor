OUT OF REACH

[1st Verse:]
Nothing in this world that Money won't buy.
Nothing that can't be packaged.
No one that can't be bribed.
It's their job to steal your life and sell it back to you.
And leave you with an empty mind.
You never even had a fucking clue.

[Chorus:]
They don't offer answer it's sell or be sold.
You can't call your soul your own.
At the end of the day do you feel like you've won?
You're too far out of reach.

[2nd Verse:]
No time to tear it down or take the rap.
You can try the upward, the upward path.
But it's never gonna give and it's a fucking lifetime long.
Only So many ways.....
You can be told you're wrong.

[Chorus]

Lost sight of the reasons.
Got lost in the crowd.
You're already knee deep in the shit.
That they're swimming in.
By the time you've given up.
You're past the point of help.
You're too far out of reach.
