FINAL BULLET

blindness is stupidity.  can't you see the fate.  you caused yourself is blasphemy.  repulsed nu being alone.  can't stand yourself.  cover your eyes there's no place to hid.  no salvation.  no reason for hesitation.  you're cure.  decide to die.  waiting for the final bullet.  no time, just crime.  you blame them.  convicted by the conspiracy to commit.  your life rut got you down.  no salvation.  no reason for hesitation.  you're cure.  decide to die.  no law, no order, no truth, just slaughter.
