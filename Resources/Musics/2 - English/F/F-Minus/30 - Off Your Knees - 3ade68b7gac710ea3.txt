OFF YOUR KNEES

if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  that's what they're telling me.  but i ain't ever goin' back there.  back down on my fucking knees.  time is running out.  what have you got?  they use you till you're wasted.  your scared and pretend you don't see.  they use you cause you let them.  scared just like i used to be.  you know technology's a weapon.  got my finger around a trigger.  this axe swings both ways you see.  and we're onto something bigger.
