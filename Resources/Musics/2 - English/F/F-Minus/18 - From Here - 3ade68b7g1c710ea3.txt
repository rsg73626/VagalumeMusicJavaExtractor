FROM HERE

To the blinded you're quite the vision
You're just a creation
You're just another version
Another way for them to
Use a front for a problem
Your pain and suffering is really just
Another slogan to your product
No time for your lessons
Who calls the shots when i have questions?
I dont see how you dont get it
You don't see it. you and your
Plan succeeded. From here we do not
See them they do not speak or listen
I see things and i believe them
Have problems and i dont see them
and i never needed you there
