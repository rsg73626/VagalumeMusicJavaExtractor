WHITE COLLAR CRIME

by the ties that bind you in the eyes they lie to.  all the lies that find you set on kill.  choices cause confusion and make the sad illusion.  you can decide when that's a lie.  when you're six feet under, will you ever wonder why you died for white collar crimes?  in the end, who sees you at this hour zero, as a man not part of their plan?  there is no... tie left to bind you.  there is no... more that you do.   there is no... lies left to hide you.  there is no... more.
