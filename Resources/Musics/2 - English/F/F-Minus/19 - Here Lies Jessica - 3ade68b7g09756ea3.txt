HERE LIES JESSICA

I can see - the beginning of the end
In your sad eyes - lies the doorway to revenge
Not really living - you can only hope
To find solace - at the end of a rope
Is this a dream - or reality?
A painful illusion - that we never see
A lifetime of silence searching for a place
Where are you going - there's no way back
No way back...
You're fooling yourself
Thought you found what you needed
But you'll get what your deserve
