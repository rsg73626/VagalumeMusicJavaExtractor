SURVIVAL

This is survival wearing you down
Stripping your mind killing your time
This is survival right to the end
Losing your grip you can't pretend
This is survival - staring you down
This is survival lord of this slum
Time to pay up nowhere to run
This is survival, not politics
Beyond transgression, beyond all of this
This is survival - staring you down
