NO CHANCE FOR CHANGE

There's a sickness on the street
So what'cha gonna do?
It's the fascist army
The boys in blue

California police state
In time they'll re-fucking segregate
Nazi government
White-bred child
They blind us with a plastic smile

No chance for change
This life ain't free
I'll kill myself if they don't kill me

This life i call disease
They tax you on your time
You can push me all you want to
But you can't touch my mind
