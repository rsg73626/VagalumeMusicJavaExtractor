FOOD NOT GOD

another day trampled under your feet.  weeds of discord.  we're your disease.  a brick through your window so you know we care.  just step outside, we're waiting out there.  exile on market street.  look outside.  push comes to shove in a rat's race that's going nowhere.  you think you're safe from the suffering.  you ignore the weak and the poor.  a violent opposition is at the door.
