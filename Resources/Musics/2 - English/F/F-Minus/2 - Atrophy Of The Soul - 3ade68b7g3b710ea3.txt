ATROPHY OF THE SOUL

i pledge allegiance to the demise of this empire of delusion.  and take with it your mind, murder and shackles of retribution.  atrophy of the soul.  convicts of a senseless order.  we hold the keys in our hands.  step outside into the darkness.  as the spires crumble into sand.
