SPIT AT THE TRUTH

my yellow press of immoral greed.  to sell their lies you can't see.  your life for sale.  fuck their way.  distorted truth sucks you in.  the love of death at ones cost.  spit at the truth.  you can't read the fine red print.  my yellow press of guns of death.  immoral greed that you can't see.  spit at the truth until your dead.
