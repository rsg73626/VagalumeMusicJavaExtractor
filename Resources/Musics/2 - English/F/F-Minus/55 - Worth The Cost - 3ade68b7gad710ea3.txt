WORTH THE COST

fallen angel from the unknown.  tell yourself lies to get home.  detonate your fear of the last days.  never a reason to change your ways.  a need of redeeming what's lost.  with dreams of blood and sloth.  tell yourself it's worth the cost.  blast it to pieces for this end defeat.  knowing he will retreat.  a need of redeeming what's lost.  with dreams of greed and sloth.  tell yourself it's worth the cost.  try to find the other side.  painful fantasy everything.  to hide gentle ride through fire and ice.  the way to hell by falling from grace.  a need of redeeming what's lost.  with dreams of lust and sloth.  tell yourself it's worth the cost.
