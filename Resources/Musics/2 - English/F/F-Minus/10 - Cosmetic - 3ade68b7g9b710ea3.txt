COSMETIC

obsessed with the images of how your lives should be.  you take the bait.  wasting your time running from time.  dreading the mirror's gaze.  there's an agency hiding behind your worst fears and your working for them.  but we've got the power and we got the vision to see through the bullshit.  hate yourself cause they tell you that you'll never really measure up.  the pressures on from the outside in.  and you know they don't care how you live or how you die, as long as a sale is made.  but we know better cause we can see beauty from the inside out.  wasting your time, running from time.  wasting your time, you take the bait.  wasting your time, you work for them.  wasting your time, fuck 'em.
