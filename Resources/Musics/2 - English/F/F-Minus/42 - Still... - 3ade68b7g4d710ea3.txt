STILL...

chaos, brutality, and pain.  families slaughtered and children maimed.  death for the sake of fame, or propaganda staged in vain.  close your eyes but it won't go away.  realize it's happening today.  hollow cheeks, empty eyes.  murder, torture, we despise.  nothing to eat.  no escape.  when will this nightmare end?
