CONTROVERSY (WORLD OF SHIT)

Too many people to please
That won't amount to shit
And reasons for controversy
and reasons to avoid it

With nothing to offer
And nothing to teach
They'll be sure to give your the world to reach
And the world is full of shit
They love to throw your in it
And watch you drown

It follws you like the blackets cloud,
that live its life to hit you
When you're down
too many people to please
and reason for controversy
