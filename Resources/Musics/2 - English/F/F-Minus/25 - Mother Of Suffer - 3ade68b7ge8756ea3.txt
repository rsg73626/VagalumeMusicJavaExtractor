MOTHER OF SUFFER

We lay our childrens minds to waste
And begin with our own sanity
Avoid looking into our hearts
To ever think or really ever feel

Together saying what's been said
Bleeding every revolution
Forever lying its wake
Another bureaucratic institution

This too shall come to pass
Hold on to the pain
