LIGHT AT THE END

the place where you are, a place to begin.  before you can say they're draggin' you in.  light at the end.  so you come from a place deep underground where it's dark and it's better the worse things are.  the more insane, the more to say.  light at the end.  when they hand out the roles you will play the thief.  who will fight to be liar?  who will fight for cheat?  i will never again care or see the things you are that ruin me.  light at the end.  no way to escape all the ways we offend.  the ruins of you, my light at the end.
