OBSECION

Antony: 
They are the five and the morning 
and I have not slept anything, 
thinking of your beauty, lunatic will stop. 
the insomnia is my punishment, 
your love will be my relief 
and until you are not mine I won't live in peace. 
Today I met your boyfriend, small and non buenmozo 
and you that the he/she doesn't love you, for their form of speaking. 
Also your you don't love him, because the one doesn't give the size, 
he/she doesn't know how to delight as he/she would make it me, 
but I will have patience because the one is not competition,
for that reason there are not reasons, for me to respect it.

Coro:(Yudy Santos) 
No, it is not love, that that your you feel, he/she calls himself obsecion, 
an illusion in your thought that makes you be things, this way 
the heart works. 

Antony: 
Very dress and in my lexus, 
go by your school, they inform me 
that you fuistes, as crazy went you to alcansar, 
it looks for you and he/she didn't find you, 
and that me procupaba, 
to calm my longing, I wanted to call you, 
but non taenia your I number, 
and your friend already denied it to me, 
that beautiful one a lot helps myself, 
and that brought me the solution, 
me you that he liked, 
and that I gave him a look, 
with a couple of words 
your I number he/she gave me, 
of the cellular one he/she called, 
and your you didn't answer, 
then I put you a pager 
and there was not connection, 
my only hope, 
it is that you hear my words 

(yudy) 
I am not able to, I have boyfriend 

(antony) 
don't please hook me 

Yudy:  choir 

I made appointment pal psychiatrist
to see if he/she helped me, 
because I no longer have friends 
for alone to speak of you, 
what I want is to speak to you, 
to try to kiss you 
to be passion of an obsecion that he/she cannot die. 
And quisas thinks that I am silly, rascal, and also crazy, 
but it is that in the love I am very original, 
I fall in love as others, 
I conquer to my way, 
to love is my talent, 
I will fall in love, 
it excuses if I offend you 
but it is that I am honest 
with luxury of particulars 
he/she listens my version 
pure cream and chocolate, 
huntarte and devour you, 
to take you to another world 
in your mind heart.
They come adventure he/she lives 
let us make a thousand madness
I will make you caresses that have not been invented.

It is not love, it is not love, it is an obsecion(repeat til fade)
