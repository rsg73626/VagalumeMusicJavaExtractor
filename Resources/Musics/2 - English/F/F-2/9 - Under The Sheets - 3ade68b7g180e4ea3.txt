UNDER THE SHEETS

They are two of the morning
I don't get to sleep to think in you
Awake dream, I enter in the car
And I will have with you.
I want you for me
I close the eyes and I let to happen
I feel your mouth, I see you without clothes
Everything is that I want.
Your sweated body to go obstacle to mine
I will take you with me to the sky
He/she tells me if it is like this that you like
And when you think that it ended
He/she returns to the I begin again
It will be perfect
It is in the morning I will be there for you... to love...

Chorus:
Me and you lying in a bed nudes (in a bed nudes)
Under the sheets the world is mine and yours (the world is mine and yours)
The time for the wind stops blowing
To do love, to do love

Me and you lying in a bed nudes (in a bed nudes)
Under the sheets the world is mine and yours (the world is mine and yours)
The time for the wind stops blowing 
To do love, under the sheets
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing else matters
If you are to my side I am happy
Not of the for explaining 
He/she sees my glance and he/she tells me that see
Complete my being
You are the piece that lacked in me
Without telling anything your body he/she says everything
In a sincere hug.
Your sweated body to go against mine
I will take you with me to the sky
He/she tells me if it is like this that you like
And when you think that it ended
He/she returns to the I begin again
It will be perfect
It is in the morning I will be there for you... to love...

Chorus:
Me and you lying in a bed nudes (in a bed nudes)
Under the sheets the world is mine and yours 
The time for the wind stops blowing
Me and you, you and me coiled in the bed nudes

Me and you lying in a bed nudes (baby you and me)
Under the sheets the world is mine and yours (the world is mine and yours)
The time for the wind stops blowing
To do love, under the sheets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me and you lying in a bed nudes
To do love.......
Me and you, you and me coiled in the bed nudes

Me and you lying in a bed nudes (baby you and me)
Under the sheets the world is mine and yours (the world is mine and yours)
The time for the wind stops blowing
To do love, under the sheets

Me and you lying in a bed nudes
Under the sheets the world is mine and yours
The time for the wind stops blowing
Me and you, you and me coiled in the bed nudes
