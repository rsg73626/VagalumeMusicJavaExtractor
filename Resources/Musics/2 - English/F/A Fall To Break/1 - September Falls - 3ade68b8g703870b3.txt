SEPTEMBER FALLS

Well I remember the day
When they both came down
And I remember the way
And I remember the sound

Cause silence breaks through grounds
I feel my heart stand still
The city's changed its life
The season's changed to make the leaves fall down

Don't leaves fall down?
When leaves fall down
Don't leaves fall down?

Well I remember the night
When the cold came through
And I remember the cries
To realize I've lost you

And only fourteen years
To have to face these fears
A father's death now shared
After two long years

September
It falls again
Do you remember?
So hard to forget
September
A day we shared
Forever
The lives are left

And now it's two years past
I guess I take years, too
I thought these feelings would pass
And in time I would forget you

But I can feel it gets chill
Whenever this day comes around
The year has changed
But the emotion stayed to make the tears fall down

September
It falls again
Do you remember?
So hard to forget
September
A day we shared
Forever
The lives are left
