BLACK FOREST II

No people no trucks no cars 
no movies no TV stars 
Humanity is erased 
Black forest left in its place 

No burgers no sports no jokes 
civlization was a hoax 
Fire, smoke rain ash and death 
Black forest the afterbreath 

No churches no garbage cans 
no punk, no garage bands 
no organisms left to grow 
Black forest and fall-out snow! 

Black Forest (x12)
