DEATH TRAIN

Death train slogging through the dusty land
pale blue water and growing sand
no passengers no engineer
no destination, far or near

Coals are burning heating up the tank
pistons churning and the wheels they clank
pressure building, throttle open wide
death train rolling on its final ride.

Coals are burning heating up the tank
