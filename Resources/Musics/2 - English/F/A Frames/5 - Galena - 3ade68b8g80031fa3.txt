GALENA

With no free breath
I crouch and stare
a dead machine
to take me there
the worst of prisons
in barren stone
the saddest depths
I work alone

A burning lamp
to give me light
It's poison gas
to aid my plight
A pick and hammer
are my only tools
I search for treasure
I search for fools

With no free breath
I crouch and stare
a dead machine
to take me there
the worst of prisons
in barren stone
the saddest depths
I work alone
