VOTE FOR ME

I was quietly watchin’ my T.V
When a man appeared and said to me
If you wanna live in harmony - Hey man - Listen
You must vote for me - Right now

You don’t have to believe the opposition
Always expressing their sour opinion
Surely I was born to be number one - Hey man - That’s why
You must vote for me - Right now

For all promises they made before
I swear I will make a better score
You know for you nothing’s gonna change
Make up your mind I’m your only chance - Hey man - Comeon
You must vote for me - Right now

There’s no time to spare anymore
There’s no time to lose like before
Time is coming for you to decide
Vote for me - Right now - Vote for me

There’s no time to spare anymore
There’s no time to lose like before
Time is coming for you to decide
Vote for me
Right now - Right now - Right now
