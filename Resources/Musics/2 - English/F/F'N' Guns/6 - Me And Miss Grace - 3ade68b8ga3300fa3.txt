ME AND MISS GRACE

In my 6 by 8 foot room - Sittin’ into the gloom - I’m bitin’ my nails
Seein’ sparklin’ the stars - Diamonds in the sky lightin’ up my face
In the beam of light I can touch the dust flyin’ in the air
I would like to be a toon - On the edge of the moon - Away from this place

All I still remember - She said « squeeze me strong! » - And I gripped her neck
I couldn’t control my hands – ‘cos I was not myself - Just losin’ my head
Ouh Yeah ! - I’m a hard lovin’ man
Miss Grace was her name - She was the kind of girl I’ve never loved before

I shall remember this in years to come
For sure I will remember till my very last bone

I hear my neighbours laughin’ - When I’m screamin’ loud - You make a big mistake
Nobody found miss Grace - Disappeared in the haze - The witness was a fake
Ouh Yeah ! - I’m a hard lovin’ man
Miss Grace was her name - She was the kind of girl I’ve never loved before

I shall remember this in years to come
For sure I will remember till my very last bone

Me and Miss Grace - We had together
Me and Miss Grace - Love story
Me and Miss Grace - Ever and ever
Me and Miss Grace

I shall remember this in years to come
For sure I will remember till my very last bone

I shall remember this in years to come
For sure I will remember till my very last bone

Me and Miss Grace - We had together
Me and Miss Grace - Love story
Me and Miss Grace - Ever and ever
Me and Miss Grace
