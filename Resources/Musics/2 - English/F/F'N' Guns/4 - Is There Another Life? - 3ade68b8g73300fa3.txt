IS THERE ANOTHER LIFE?

Sometimes I wonder what is my mission - Why I was born what I’m doing here
Yes I believe in reincarnation - Anyway - Is there an other life after the last breath ?


That’s my question - Who’s got an answer ? - Have I an option ? - To be back here on earth
Do I have the time ? - To finish all I started - This obsession blows my mind
Is there an other life after the last breath ?

Is there an angel by my side taking care of me ?
Is there a special ticket to the Heaven’s door ?
Is there a friend of mine waiting to receive me ? - Is there a Heaven - Heaven ?
Have I an option to be back to relive my life ?
Is there any chance of return to finish all I started ?
Too many questions I’m going crazy

Sometimes I think about the people I use to love
Where are their souls are they waiting for me above ?
What about the new-born in her mother’s arms
Is he a parent or a friend of mine ?

Is there an angel by my side taking care of me ?
Is there a special ticket to the Heaven’s door ?
Is there a friend of mine waiting to receive me ? - Is there a Heaven - Heaven ?
Have I an option to be back to relive my life ?
Is there any chance of return to finish all I started ?
Too many questions I’m going crazy

Is there an other life ? - An other life ? - After the last breath ?...
Is there an Heaven ? - Is there an Heaven ? - Is there an Heaven ?...
