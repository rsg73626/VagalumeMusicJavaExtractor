THE GUN

Tonight - It’s too dangerous - He’s got an eye on you do not walk in the dark
He likes - To dominate the news - For him you are just a score against the F.B.I

If you don’t wanna be his victim
Watch out he’s on all fronts
If you don’t wanna be a victim
You’d better go back where you belong

Mercy - He doesn’t know that word - Proclaiming to be the biggest serial killer of the world
Tinny - Is the sound of his voice - I sware he’s got one you’ve never heard before

If you don’t wanna be his victim
Watch out he’s on all fronts
If you don’t wanna be a victim
You’d better go back where you belong

Run – Run - Run - He’s got an eyes on you
Run – Run - Run - He’s at the rendez-vous

If you don’t wanna be his victim
Watch out he’s on all fronts
If you don’t wanna be a victim
You’d better go back where you belong

Run – Run - Run - He’s got an eyes on you
Run – Run - Run - He’s at the rendez-vous
Run – Run - Run - Take care of yourself
Run – Run - Run - The shadow’s got a gun
Run – Run - Run - The shadow is on the run
