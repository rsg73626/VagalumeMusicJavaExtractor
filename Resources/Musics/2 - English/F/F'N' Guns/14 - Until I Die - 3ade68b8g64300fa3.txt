UNTIL I DIE

There’s a desert on my mind I don’t understand
I see nothing of what I have done
And I try in vain as strong as I can
I am lost like dead leaves on the ground - Listen to my song

Poor man in disgrace looking for a place
Where I can jump and run in the sun
Would you mind to show all I want to know
A million questions whirl into my head - Listen to my song

If I had the time to relive my life
For sure I will take you away
The only one thing that I know tonight
You’re the one - The only one

Hand in hand as strong as we can
We’ve been together for a long time
Side by side with you I feel fine
Until I die music you’ll be my friend
My best friend - Woh - ouh - oh - oh

There’s a desert on my mind I don’t understand
I see nothing of what I have done
And I try in vain as strong as I can
I am lost like dead leaves on the ground - Listen to my song

Listen to my song...
