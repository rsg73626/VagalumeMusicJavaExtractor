SHE GOES ON

Like a snake she’s turnin’ around me
I don’t know why but I love her style
She makes me love till I’m crazy
Her hot blast blows my mind

Her fingers workin’ on me drive me mad
Burnin’ kisses and thrill is come
Sometime I’m afraid but it’s not too bad
She take me for a joke all night long

I feel my body heat
She’s a woman on fire
She has fixed her choice upon me
To gratify all desires

She turns around
She turns around
She turns around me till I come
And I’m so tired
Yes I’m so tired
But she goes on

She makes no bones about my pillow
I’m screamin’ « stop ! » but she don’t care
Now she is ready to do the great show
I’m travellin’ between Heaven and Hell

I feel my body heat
She’s a woman on fire
She has fixed her choice upon me
To gratify all desires

She turns around
She turns around
She turns around me till I come
And I’m so tired
Yes I’m so tired
But she goes on
