SEXY LIZZY

I still remember when I was young
They always asked me where I came from
I couldn’t tell what was the name
The name of the place where I came
So they called me the stranger
They called me the stranger any time

They were laughing every day
I didn’t understand what they said
Sometimes kids are so bad
I remember it left me so sad
When they called me the stranger
They called me the stranger any time

But you came to me with your smile
Opening your arms holding me tight
Since that day I stay with you
‘cause I trusted - I trusted you
You’re in love with the stranger - You are right

I can see you night and day
I can touch you - C’mon miss Lizzy
I can love you everywhere - So I say - Yes I say

Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight
Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight - Tonight

They were laughing every day
I didn’t understand what they said
Sometimes kids are so bad
I remember it left me so sad
I can see you night and day
I can touch you - C’mon miss Lizzy
I can love you everywhere - So I say - Yes I say

Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight
Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight - Tonight

Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight
Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight
Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight
Gimme your love - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight - Tonight - Tonight

Oh Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight - Sexy Lizzy - Gimme your love tonight -
Gimme your love - Tonight - Gimme your sex sex sex Sexy Lizzy...
