TODAY (IT'S MY DAY OFF)

Today - It’s a lovely day - Watch the sunshine

Today it’s my day off - It’s amazing to sleep late
Laying on my bed - I appreciate

Looking at the ceiling - I’m lost in my thoughts
Thinking ‘bout the little things - I can’t do the week

Today it’s my day off - I promise to repare everything
Darling your man is home – Preach out your will

Anyway there’s plenty of time - House is not on fire
I’m gonna make a planning of the day - I’m gonna do it methodically

We don’t need to be nervous there’s no hurry
There’s a place in the sun for everyone
It’s a lovely day and the sun is shining - Shine - Shine

Today it’s my day off - I’m gonna wash my car
I’ll have to mow the lawn – ( Take the dog a walk!)

Anyway there’s plenty of time - House is not on fire
I’m gonna make a planning of the day - I’m gonna do it methodically

We don’t need to be nervous there’s no hurry
There’s a place in the sun for everyone
It’s a lovely day and the sun is shining - Shine – Shine

Today was my day off - It was amazing to sleep late
Laying on my bed - It was x-rated

Today was my day off - And time was passing by
I didn’t see the hands of time - Here comes the night
