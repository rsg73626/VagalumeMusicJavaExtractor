HERE WE GO AGAIN

He ran everywhere - And his tongue was hanging out
But we did not care - ‘Cause he sounded a long way off - Yes he was

‘Cause we knew we would be together - With all our friends
Yes we knew we would be together - And here we go again

He’s in a hole - Somewhere living in the gutter
Belzebuth took his soul - He ought to have known better - Yes indeed !

‘Cause we knew we would be together - With all our friends – again
Yes we knew we would be together - And here we go again

Sometimes we know it’s damned hard to play - We often take so many dirty tricks
But a real friend stay always on the way - Now go to Hell – Here we go again

We heard the calls of our friends
And here we go

Oooh here we go again - Oooh here we go again
Oooh here we go again - Oooh here we go again
Oooh here we go again - Oooh here we go again
Oooh here we go again - Oooh here we go again
