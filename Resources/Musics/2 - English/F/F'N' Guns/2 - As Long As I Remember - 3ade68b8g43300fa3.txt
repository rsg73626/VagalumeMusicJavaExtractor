AS LONG AS I REMEMBER

As long as I remember
When I was younger at school
I use to rag the teacher
Always breakin’ the rules
Playin’ hookey with friends of mine
Off the beaten tracks all the time
As long as I remember I was a fool

Mother told me one day
Listen to me little boy
You’d better go the right way
If you really wanna be someone
I was hearin’ all your advice Mum
Goin’ in one ear and out of the other one
As long as I remember I was a fool

Time is passin’ by
I can’t relive my life
And the hands of time
Are runnin’ runnin’
Time is passin’ by
And now I realise
How much I was a fool

As long as I remember
I was proud to be wild
I thought I was the winner
Playin’ chess with my life
Like a boss rulin’ the roost all around me
Fightin’ for nothing always disagreein’
As long as I remember I was a fool

Time is passin’ by
I can’t relive my life
And the hands of time
Are runnin’ runnin’
Time is passin’ by
And now I realise
How much I was a fool

As long as I remember – I was a fool
