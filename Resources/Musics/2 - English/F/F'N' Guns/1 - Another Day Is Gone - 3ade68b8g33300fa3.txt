ANOTHER DAY IS GONE

Another day is gone
Another one will come
When I look all around me
Do you know what I see ?

My world is upside down
Without you in my home
And my life seems so empty
Is this my destiny ?

Every day I try to be strong
- But it’s so long long long long long
I’m waiting for another day
- The one I’ll see you on my way

I do the best I can
I’m just a simple man
I wish I could read your mind
I’m running out of time

You’re out of my sight
- Am I wrong or right ?
But I give you a rendez-vous in another life
This is not a lie
- Till the day I die
- You’ll always be the one

Another day is gone
Another one will come
When I look all around me
Do you know what I see ?

As I look all around me
- No-one looks for me
