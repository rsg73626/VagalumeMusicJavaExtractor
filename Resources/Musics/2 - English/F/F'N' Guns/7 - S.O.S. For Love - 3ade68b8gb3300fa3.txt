S.O.S. FOR LOVE

A fuzzy picture is floating on my mind
I’m trying to remember your hair and your smile
Mist in my brain I only remember your name

You were my first love first passion one
Wanted to be yours but you didn’t come
You left me there with my s.o.s for love
S.O.S for love

Looking back now over my shoulder
I find myself cold and older
Looking for a new sun a new horizon

I thaught it was forever it was a dream
We’ll never be together you disappeared
You left me there with my s.o.s for love
S.O.S for love

S.O.S - S.O.S for love
S.O.S for a smile
S.O.S - S.O.S for love
For love

We have it all our destiny to share
Life goes on and today I don’t care
I’ve got a wife who looks after my heart

No regrets and no more tears
Don’t need to cry again for you babe
Now I forget my s.o.s for love
S.O.S for love

S.O.S - S.O.S for love
I don’t need anymore
S.O.S - S.O.S for love
For love
