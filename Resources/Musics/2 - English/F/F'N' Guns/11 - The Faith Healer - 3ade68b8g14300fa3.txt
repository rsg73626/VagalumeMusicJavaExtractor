THE FAITH HEALER

If your body's feeling bad - And it's the only one you have.
You want to take away the pain - Got out walking in the rain.
You watch the flowers go too bad - Asked the man inside your head.
Your spirit never has to grieve - All you've got to do is believe.
The faith healer - The faith healer
All you've got to do is feel - Your body's goin' to start to heal.
Fingertips and holy fire - Everlasting sweet desire.
It don't matter what the doctor said - The healer man sail away,
Immortality for two - Miracles begun to you.
The faith healer - The faith healer

Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?

Faith and hope and charity - Simple relativity.
He can make you understand – All you’ve got to do is take his hand.
It don't matter what’s your mother said - Asked a man inside your head:
Fingertips and holy fire - Everlasting sweet desire
The faith healer - The faith healer

Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands!……
Let me put my hands on you
Let me put my hands!……
