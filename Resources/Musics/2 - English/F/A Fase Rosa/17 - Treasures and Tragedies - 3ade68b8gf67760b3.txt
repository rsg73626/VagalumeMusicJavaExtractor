TREASURES AND TRAGEDIES

I see all the flowers and the flying bees
All the do's and don'ts, don't you see
What I've been trying to do to you and me
I see all the treasures and tragedies
All the melodies and harmonies
Harmonizing you and me

Eu que nunca quis mais nada al√©m
Seu colo, minha mulher
Eu nunca quis sair daqui
Seu colo, minha mulher

I see all the mornings and the more I see
It becomes so clear that life begins
In the exact moment you make with me
