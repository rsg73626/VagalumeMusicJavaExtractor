DEAD IN MY EYES

how foolish we can be
to think that your portrait became the epitome
an angel inside your heart
i still remember that day that you blinked three times
when three months were erased in three days and three nights
such a beautiful facade / the repetition ceases to amaze me
three weeks away could not bring perspective
for friendship once thought cherished
now just a candle falling victim to your cold breath
you say that angels can't die
i saw one hiding motionless beneath blood stained sheets
dead in my eyes
