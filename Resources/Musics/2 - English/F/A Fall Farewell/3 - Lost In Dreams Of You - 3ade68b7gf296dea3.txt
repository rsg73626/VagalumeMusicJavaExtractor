LOST IN DREAMS OF YOU

close my eyes so tight it hurts
hurt is better than hollow
void of feeling, of life
a leap away from freedom
sometimes here, without even a whisper
empty and broken, the gift of death tempts the lonely / it's cold again
not even the steam can hide the space
this voice is dying
the more i give, the less of me remains
now i'm yours alone
tucked away, dreaming of purpose
belonging nowhere / lost in dreams of you
your face erased by time
will these eyes know the sight
that opened them for the first time
since that season of death
