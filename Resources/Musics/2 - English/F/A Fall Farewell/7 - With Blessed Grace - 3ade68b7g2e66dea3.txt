WITH BLESSED GRACE

a face so weathered and abused
eyes are constant / wide open but blind
desperately seeking
with every grasp falling farther
screams break the silence
his words echo, haunting every move
i never heard your heart break
as it fell from my hands
your tears are mine
dying with every empty night / so lucid now
selfish ambitions shielded truth
saving myself i watched you fall
and with this blade i close my eyes
will my blood rushing save your life
you bear the force of every storm
with blessed grace
you are the river, i am the rain
