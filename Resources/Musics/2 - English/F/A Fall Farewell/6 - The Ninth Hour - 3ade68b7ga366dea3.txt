THE NINTH HOUR

overwhelming fallacy / blinding all but one
sick of the screaming / fearful of truth
when the oceans part again
and the dust is all that has ever been
premonitions verified / and this is all we are
i am nothing just like you
centuries of conflict
so this is progress
growing smaller with every life
dancing around the fire
i'd rather bury my head / than the bodies in the sand
so this is progress
tearing down pleas / standing on dreams
washing their suits / in innocent blood
