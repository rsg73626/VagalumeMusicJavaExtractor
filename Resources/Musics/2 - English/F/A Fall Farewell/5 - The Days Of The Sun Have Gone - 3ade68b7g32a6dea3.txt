THE DAYS OF THE SUN HAVE GONE

i used to pray for the winter
now frozen in regret
it's been so long
life without cold
now no more than a dream
the sky hangs broken overhead
the days of the sun are gone
the clouds not only in my mind
failed attempts to substitute new light
only compounding the cold
darkness overtaking
blood running cold / skin begins to crack
the journey is dead
there is no light at the end of the tunnel
