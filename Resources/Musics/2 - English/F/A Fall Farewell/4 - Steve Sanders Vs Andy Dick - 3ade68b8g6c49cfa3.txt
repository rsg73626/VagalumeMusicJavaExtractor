STEVE SANDERS VS ANDY DICK

I know, that i owe you at least
A novel or two
But now
I'll try, to charm and burn away this song instead

Since youve left, i havent had
More than i've had full of moments
That reached the high point of hapiness
I felt before you fled.
Youre the hole in myself,
I havent been able yet,
To fill with toxins and sex.

And i promise that one day
I'll stop trying
Maybe today will be the day when i stop
Lying to everyone except myself
Maybe today will be the day when you call
Maybe tomorrow,
Because its "one of those days"

Why does yesterday always seem
So long ago?
Youre the only one who keeps me honest
Or at least youre the only one who tries

I'm not quite sure if this is sober
Or if youre just a quiet high.
And i promise,
That one day- i'll stop lying.

I know that i owe you at least a novel or two
But now i'll try
To charm and burn away this song instead.
Why does yesterday always seem
Youre the only one who keeps me honest
Or at least youre the only one who tries
Im not quite sure if this is sober
Or a youre just a quiet high.
Running away for comfort
You seek the safety of your side
