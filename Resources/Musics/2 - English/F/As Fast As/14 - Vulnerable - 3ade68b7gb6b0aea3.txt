VULNERABLE

Saw your face in a photograph 
pinned up on my wall 
dropped a disc on the phonograph 
sang the words to it all 

pick up the pieces and run away 
I feel so numb since you called 
there's a nail in my chest 
my head's full of cement 
how far can I fall? 

I’m so vulnerable 
so vulnerable 
so vulnerable 

[chorus:] 
was it a lie 
was it a fake 
a sad and beautiful mistake? 
now I know you don't know where I’m coming from 
eye for an eye 
give me a break 
I lost everything at stake 
now I know you don't know where I’m coming from 

wrote you a letter the other day 
I just ripped it in half 
I had to watch it all drain away 
choke on all the thoughts of the past 

yeah you're vulnerable 
so vulnerable 
so vulnerable 

[chorus] 
now I know you don't know where I’m coming from 

[chorus] 
and I know you don’t know where I’m coming from 
now I’ll never know where you are coming from
