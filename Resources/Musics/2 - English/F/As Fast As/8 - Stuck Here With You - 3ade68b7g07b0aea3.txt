STUCK HERE WITH YOU

Never imagined I’d feel so low 
I’m confused and it's starting to show 
a finger-painted poster-board 
for crippled smiles and empty joy 
has left the building once again 

[chorus:] 
what can I say? 
what can I do? 
I can't believe I’m stuck here with you 
what to believe? 
what is the truth? 
I’m putting all my faith into you 

now that you mention my solemn face 
I know it seems so out of place 
a laughing stripe(?) with painted claws 
is tearing up my precious cause 
I’ll displace for impact again 

[chorus] 

spring’s the time for somersaults 
that fall upon the winds a waltz 
keep me counting days in my room 
evening brings the morning doves 
that end an afternoon of love 
to watch the midnight stars on my roof 

[chorus]
