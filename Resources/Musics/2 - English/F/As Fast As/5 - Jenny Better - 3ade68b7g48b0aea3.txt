JENNY BETTER

Jenny better make her mind up fast 
choose between what's fun and what will last 
never wants to go to work 
never wants to go to church 
Jenny better make her mind up fast 

[chorus:] 
what's wrong 
was it something that I said? 
(so long) cuz you're acting like she's dead 
(this song) is just what's inside your head 

[chorus two:] 
I bet you’d say no way 
I’m feeling much worse today 
when will you be here to stay 
I’ll say, Jenny I’ll stay 

Jenny just will not get out of bed 
can’t get past the demons in her head 
never wants to talk to you 
never wants to talk to me 
Jenny better make her mind up fast 

[chorus] 
[chorus two] 

Jenny better make her mind up fast 
choose between what’s fun and what will last 

[chorus] 
[chorus two] 

Jenny I’ll stay
