ALL THESE WORDS

You want to grow so badly 
you want your space so much 
that you’d leave me behind 

I want to reconcile 
and I even wait awhile 
but you're too different now 

[chorus:] 
all these words can mean no harm 
and all these words can kill 
all I want is you my love 
but now I’ve seen you kill 

you want to push me down 
and I want to kick you 'round 
but what would that achieve? 

you think your friends are right 
so you left me overnight 
but I’m the only one 

[chorus]
