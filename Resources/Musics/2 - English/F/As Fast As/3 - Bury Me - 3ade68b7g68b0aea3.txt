BURY ME

Bury me where the flowers don't grow 
I’m dead and gone but you'll never know 
you'll never, you'll never, you'll never know 

facedown in a riverbank 
she spits a mouthful of mud 
cold kill, red stains and greasy streaks 
washed away by the flood 

all I have is this photograph 
it reminds me of you 
it reminds me 
1000 crippled words in this photograph 

bury me where the flowers don't grow 
I’m dead and gone but you'll never know 

blood on bone rings a desperate bell 
one hand tied, screaming like hell 

all I have is this photograph 
it reminds me of you 
it reminds me 
1000 crippled words in this photograph 

bury me where the flowers don't grow 
I’m dead and gone but you'll never know 
bury me where the flowers don't grow 
I’m dead and gone but you'll never know 

blue tear-streaks leave a crystallized glow 
they rip, they rip, my cheeks the faster they flow 
the faster, the faster, the faster
