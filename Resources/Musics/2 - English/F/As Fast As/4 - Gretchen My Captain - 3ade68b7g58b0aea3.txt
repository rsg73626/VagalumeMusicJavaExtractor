GRETCHEN MY CAPTAIN

Frost on the port hole 
it doesn’t look so angry after all 
we’re low on water 
it was a one-way mission after all 

Gretchen my captain 
so strong I never noticed your blue eyes 
never look hungry 
I guess I shouldn’t have been so surprised 

[chorus:] 
what would your mother say to that 
if she found out about your friends 
what would your father think 
if he knew you and I have before and will again 

I find it painful 
to see your face and finally know that I 
don’t have what you need 
I never will, not even up so high 

six months till we die 
you love me 
yes I know 
and so do I 

red rock, like concrete 
can swing into my side and change your mind 
you know it can but 

[chorus]
