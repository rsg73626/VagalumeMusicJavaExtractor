AT LEAST I TASTED LOVE

One good kiss deserves another 
fix my hair and wash my hands 
vanity meets common sense 
never got to know your mother 
I suppose that had I tried 
I’d be pleasantly surprised 
and I would be a better man 
nothing great but everything I am 

flying fists just call for cover 
don’t let your pretty face take the heat 
it’s best avoided on your feet 
why try keeping up with the Joneses? 
they make more money than you can 
and having things won’t buy you friends 
and I could be a better man 
nothing great but everything I am 

[chorus:] 
I’m a grown man 
and I’m to blame 
I pull my head up from the sand 
and the world takes aim 
but hey, at least I tasted love 
if even only once 
at least I tasted love 

business people bearing flowers 
suck you dry and leave you dead 
now paranoid with fucked up heads 
won’t be a corporate sucker 
I wear my heart on my sleeve 
you can stay or you can leave 
cuz I’ve become a better man 
nothing great but everything I am 

[chorus] 

at least I tasted love 

a casualty of a useless war 
in a back no-name 
a fool with a lousy poker face 
just lost the game
