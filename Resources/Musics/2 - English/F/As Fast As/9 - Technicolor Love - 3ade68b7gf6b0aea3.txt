TECHNICOLOR LOVE

Mis'rey loves company 
that's why I found you 
just because I can see 
that you're a shade of blue 

[chorus:] 
open up your eyes and see 
a battered grey society 
when you come sit next to me 
we’ll finally be 
a technicolor love 

we’ve become jaded to the bright and happy days 
we got lost behind the wheel and blinded by the haze 

[chorus]
