OPEN LETTER TO THE DAMNED

You think you’re playing your cards right 
you can’t believe you’ve grown so tight 
she’s so hard to please 
even down on your knees 
you can beg ‘baby please’ 
but it’ll just make a scene 

you can give her your time 
but she’ll turn on a dime 
what’s your story here’s mine 
she’s got a social disease 

she said she liked my fucked up hair 
she liked my cold, come hither stare 
she loved that I was dumb 
she loved my rough first note 
she told me she’d always be there 

[chorus:] 
open your eyes and avoid the surprise 
before she fucks with your head 
and a part of you dies, oh no 
you’ll be feeling my pain 
and I’ll tell you again 
and again and again and again 
you better run while you can 

[Chorus 2] 
cuz that woman’s made a fool of me 
for the last time 
I’m no fool 
that devil’s kept me up all night 
for the last time 
hallelujah 

and now I look into her eyes 
ice cold and blue as autumn skies 
I feel so much regret 
for what’s not happened yet 
in fact step back because she’s mine 

[chorus] 

[chorus 2](x2)
