THIS IS REAL

Frost on the door 
melts away like butter in the noontime sun 
like before 
you ape around and fell over cuz you're having fun 

it's in your town, it's on your streets 
it's in your house, it's on TV 
it's in your papers, books and magazines 
we don't need no jets or submarines 

it's what you want it to be 
will it sneak up on me 
it's the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 
pass the time 
punch a clock with a hammer that you had in line 
solve the crime 
pinch yourself to find out you woke up and died 

it's in the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 
it's in the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 
it's so wrong that it's real 

it's what you want it to be 
will it sneak up on me 
it's the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 

it's what you want it to be 
will it sneak up on me 
it's the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 

it's in the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 
it's in the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real 
it's so wrong that it's real 

it's what you want it to be 
will it sneak up on me 
it's the way that you feel 
it's so wrong that it's real
