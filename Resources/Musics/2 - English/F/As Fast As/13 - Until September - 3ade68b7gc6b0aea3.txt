UNTIL SEPTEMBER

Yellow finger cigarette 
raccoon socket black regret 
if summer was a pill 
I’d be doped up still 
January marches on 
still you linger in my song 
thought I’d moved along 
but every time I see you 
I remember 

[chorus:] 
Saturdays it’s raining in your room 
I kiss you while you sleep 
until September 
watching out for you leads to my doom 
you say it’s for the best 
but I suppose 
we’ll never know 
I suppose 
we’ll never know 

try and try to force myself 
to think about somebody else 
the dead come out at night 
a colossal waste of time 
I pour myself a cup of tea 
it’s peppered bees and scalding heat 
try to see your face 
but every time I think I can’t remember 

[chorus] 
terminal velocities on hold 
cuz what you say to me 
I contemplate but shrug 
and walk away 
tell me what you want is 
just to nail me to the cross 
so I can finally breathe a sigh 
while I remember 

[chorus]
