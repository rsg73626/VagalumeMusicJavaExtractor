THIS TIME

You clutch 
you gasp 
you don't know what it was 
but sure enough you’re running for the door 
you slip 
it passed 
it hurt so bad 
please leave me alone 

[chorus:] 
this time I can feel the tiny little hairs 
on the back of my neck stand up 
wake up screaming in the night 
this time you came too close 
but your number ain't up 
so stand up, stand up, stand up 

eyes of 
relief 
you don't know what it was 
but you don't have to worry anymore 
so close 
my god 
so close 
to leaving 
leaving me alone 

[chorus] 

no I can't face it alone 
I’m so accident-prone 
who will bail me out? 
no I’m not ready now 
keep it steady now 
don’t you dare check out 

[chorus]
