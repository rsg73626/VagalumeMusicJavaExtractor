WASTED YOUTH

[chorus:] 
Can you tell me the truth 
it’s what you wanted to do 
blame it on my wasted youth 
it’s what you wanted to do 

I’ve licked the garbage queen divine 
now I’m gonna watch it turn 
you kicked the habit and you’re fine 
now show me what you’ve learned 
you cut your hair and so did I 
you’re a fox and I’m a fern 
I’m so happy now that I’ll 
watch it burn, watch it burn 

[bridge] 
big truck, sharp knife 
fast car, a hot wife 
long legs, big heist 
high heels, short life 
red brick, cold steel 
big dick, oatmeal 
cold cash, concrete 
insert, repeat 

[chorus] 

I stuck a magnet in your eye 
now you're fucked like Laura Dern 
I never lived before I died 
so show me some concern 
I should’ve quit before I tried 
now my belly’s full of worms 
I’m so happy now that I’ll 
watch it burn, watch it burn 

[bridge] 

insert, repeat (x4) 

[chorus]
