SANDAZ 4 SHOES

Maybe you love me 
maybe I’m a monkey 
maybe you're just bored 
with a belly full of drinks 
so you wanna take me home and fuck me 

maybe I’m a puppet 
maybe I’m a prophet 
maybe you're just bitter at your own shortcomings 
so you're gonna do your best to stop it 

[chorus:] 
either way you seem so confused 
why I don't wear sandals for shoes 
think you'd better focus your view 
till the show expires 
I’ll be your messiah 
do what I say, I say what you do 

maybe I’m the greatest 
maybe you don't know it 
maybe you just over think my simple songs 
and review me as a second-rate poet 

maybe I’m the flavor 
maybe I’m your savior 
maybe I just got inside your fucked up head 
and told you what to think about your neighbor 

[chorus] 

either way you seem so confused 
why I don't wear sandals for shoes 
think you'd better focus your view 

[chorus]
