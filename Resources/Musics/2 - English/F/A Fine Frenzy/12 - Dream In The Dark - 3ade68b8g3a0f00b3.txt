DREAM IN THE DARK

Bye, bye darlin?
It?s time to go
Got lost in your magic
Oh I
Longed for you so

Spent my life waiting
For a sight of the sea
Been sitting beside it
And you?re
All that I?ve seen

It?s hard to grasp
It all will pass
If you wanted my love then
You would have asked
So?

Bye, bye darlin?
(W)hole of my heart
In dreams you follow
But I dream in the dark
