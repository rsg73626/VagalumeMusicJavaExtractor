LOVE SICK

You’re sweet as a fruit
That’s coming to ground.
Go with the spotlight, she is out.
Out to be yours and I am a detail miner.
Detailed so it seems planning the seas.
A doubt in your mind,
You’re playing for keeps but so am I.
But I am fighting for keeping us together.

I need to believe you,
Lovesick only you can fix it.
I need you, I need you to stay.

You say she’s a friend, but no friend of mine.
I’ve never been called the jealous kind
But I got a cause ‘cause I am a detail miner.
And you are the price, she’s aiming to win
I fell in a sea where I fit in.
Cause there is a room for three in two, no is there?

I need to believe you,
Love sick only you can fix it.
I need you, I need you to stay.
The panic’s distracting.
Love sick only you can fix it.
I need you, I need to stay.

Bang Bang Bang - and the walls are falling, falling.
Bang Bang Bang - to the dusty road.
Bang Bang Bang - but she keeps on calling, calling, calling.
Bang Bang Bang - why don’t you let her go?

I need to believe you,
Love sick only you can fix it.
I need you, I need you to stay.
The panic’s distracting.
Love sick only you can fix it.
I need you, I need to stay.
