NEAR TO YOU

He and I had something beautiful,
But so dysfunctional, it couldn't last
I loved him so, but I let him go
'Cause I knew he'd never love me back

Such pain as this
Shouldn't have to be experienced
I'm still reeling from the loss,
Still a little bit delirious

Near to you, I am healing,
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you

But you and I have something different
And I'm enjoying it cautiously
I'm battle scarred,
But I am working, oh, so hard
To get back to who I used to be

He's disappearing, fading steadily
Well, I'm so close to being yours,
Won't you stay with me, please

'Cause near to you, I am healing,
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you

I only know that
I am better where you are
I only know that
I am better where you are
I only know that I belong
Where you are

Near to you, I am healing,
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on

Near to you, I am healing,
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you
Yet, I'm better near to you
