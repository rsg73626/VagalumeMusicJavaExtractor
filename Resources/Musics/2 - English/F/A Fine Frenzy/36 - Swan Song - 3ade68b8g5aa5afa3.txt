SWAN SONG

Wretched, look at me, I've lost it, melting on the table
In parking lots and markets
I cant help it, I love you like a starfish loves the salty water
Like a selfish daughter

But I wrote the words to the swan song
The author of the wrong
And I said what I said and I meant it
But now I regret it

Foolish, how was I so careless
Pawning off my treasure, the envy of an heiress
Now my dollars are crumbled in my pocket
How can I reclaim it?
What if someone's got it?

I wrote the words to the swan song
The author of the wrong
And I said what I said and I meant it
But now I regret it

How could the world have turned so ugly
I am dying
Could you touch me again?
Touch me again

When I wrote the words to the swan song
The author of the wrong
And I said what I said and I meant it
But now I regret it
