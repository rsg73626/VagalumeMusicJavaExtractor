THINK OF YOU

Its one hundred and nine degrees
In this crowded room
No room to breathe
With walls as cold as a gallery
This is no place for me

Such hard faces set in smoke
The smell of anger's in my clothes
It's a bad night to be alone
But that's the way it goes

And I think of you
Whenever life gets me down
I think of you
Whenever you're not around

And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Yeah, but you still pull me home

I thought I had it figured out
In a brand new life with great big house
And grey initials on the towels
I should be happy now, well

You got yourself a family
And you planted roots down by the sea
I saw you once on the street
You didn't notice me

But I think of you
Whenever life gets me down
I think of you
Whenever you're not alone

And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Yeah, but you still pull me home

Just to put your mind at ease
You don't owe me anything
You paid me with you memory

And I think of you
Whenever life gets me down
I think of you
Whenever you're not around

And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Yeah, but you still pull me home
Yeah, but you still pull me home
