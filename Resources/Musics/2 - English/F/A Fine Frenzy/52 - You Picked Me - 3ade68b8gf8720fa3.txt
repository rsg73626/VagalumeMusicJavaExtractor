YOU PICKED ME

One, two, three, 
Counting out the signs we see 
The tall buildings 
Fading in the distance 
Only dots on a map 
Four, five, six, 
The two of us a perfect fit 
You're all mine, all mine 

And all I can say 
Is you blow me away 

Like an apple on a tree 
Hiding out behind the leaves 
I was difficult to reach, 
But you picked me 
Like a shell upon a beach 
Just another pretty piece 
I was difficult to see, 
But you picked me, 
Yeah, you picked me 

So softly, 
Rain against the windows 
And the strong coffee 
Warming up my fingers 
In this fisherman's house 
You got me, 
Searched the sand 
And climbed the tree 
And brought me back down 

And all I can say 
Is you blow me away 

Like an apple on a tree 
Hiding out behind the leaves 
I was difficult to reach, 
But you picked me 
Like a shell upon a beach 
Just another pretty piece 
I was difficult to see, 
But you picked me, 
Yeah, you picked me

Like an apple on a tree 
Hiding out behind the leaves 
I was difficult to reach, 
But you picked me 
Like a shell upon a beach 
Just another pretty piece 
I was difficult to see, 
But you picked me, 
Yeah, you picked me

Like an apple on a tree 
Hiding out behind the leaves 
I was difficult to reach, 
But you picked me 
Like a shell upon a beach 
Just another pretty piece 
I was difficult to see, 
But you picked me, 
Yeah, you picked me
