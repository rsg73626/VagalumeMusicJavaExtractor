THE WELL

Standing still I'm gonna stand still, stiller than the stones
You know I will, oh you can test my will
It won't go breaking with my bones
Take a picture, take a lasting look of the girl you once adored
Hide it somewhere in your secret book, think of me no more

Following my wish into the well, down into your deepest dark I fell
Drowning with your kisses in the well
I look to you for saving but you're saving someone else

Go on home, won't you go home, go where you belong
Left alone I'm better left alone, the one you didn't want
Standing still I'm gonna stand still, stiller than the stones
You know I will, oh you can test my will
It won't go breaking with my bones

Following my wish into the well, down into your deepest dark I fell
Drowning with your kisses in the well
I look to you for saving but you're saving someone else

No one knows
No one knows

Following my wish into the well, down into your deepest dark I fell
Drowning with your kisses in the well
I look to you for saving but you're saving someone else
