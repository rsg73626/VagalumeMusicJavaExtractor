DEVIL'S TRADE

Under the night coat and over the skin,
turn all the lights out and let us begin.
Gather this falling, a bird to your breast
should sing you a song if you take her to bed.

Oh, the devil's trade freedom for all our days.
The apple had the price of a snake.
And I will pay.

Soft as a dormouse, untangle our limbs.
A kiss on the knee, now you're gone with the wind.
Everything's different and I don't belong.
I'm cold as a kitchen in the breaking of dawn.

And though it hurts to breathe, I'd die before I'd leave.

Oh, the devil's trade freedom for all our days.
The apple had the price of a snake.
But I will pay.
