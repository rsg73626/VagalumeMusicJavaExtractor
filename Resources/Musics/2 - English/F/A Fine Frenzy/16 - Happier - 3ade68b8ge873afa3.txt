HAPPIER

Quick kid quips, so harsh and cynical
Touches stricken cold and clinical
Such a transformation to behold
I don't like this new, I like the old
It's not the words that make it final
You've said such things before to rival them
But it's how you say them now that's changed
Cold but sympathetic all the same

You'd like to convince me that I'll be better off

So you go on and I'll be happier
I'll be happier
You go on, yeah, you go on
You'll be gone and I'll be happier
Shoot me with your rubber bullets
Your finger's on the trigger, pull it
I know you want the suffering to end
And so, it is forgivable my friend

All to convince me that I'll be better off

Say what you mean, what you mean
Is you'll be happier without me
Without me
Without me
