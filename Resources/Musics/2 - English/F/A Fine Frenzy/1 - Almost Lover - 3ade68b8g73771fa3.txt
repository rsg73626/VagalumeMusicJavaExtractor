ALMOST LOVER

Your fingertips across my skin,
the palm trees swaying in the wind, 
images
you sang me spanish lullabies, 
the sweetest sadness in your eyes
clever trick.

well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

goodbye my almost lover
goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
can't you just let me be
so long my luckless romance
my back is turned on you
should have known you'd bring me heartache
almost lovers always do

we walked along a crowded street,
you took my hand and danced with me, 
images
and when you left you kissed my lips,
you told you'd never, ever forget these images

well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

goodbye my almost lover
goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
can't you just let me be
so long my luckless romance
my back is turned on you
should have known you'd bring me heartache
almost lovers always do

I cannot go to the ocean
cannot drive the streets at night
cannot wake up in the morning
without you on my mind
so you're gone and I'm haunted
I'll bet you are just fine
did I make it that easy to you to walk
right in and out of my life?

goodbye my almost lover
goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
can't you just let me be
so long my luckless romance
my back is turned on you
should have known you'd bring me heartache
almost lovers always do
