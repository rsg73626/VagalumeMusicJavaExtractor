AVALANCHES (CULLA'S SONG)

We found ourselves atop of a mountain peak
The air was thin as a beggar?s sleeve
The city lights were miles away
The hush was as thick as your winter coat
And you wrote our names in the morning
Snow with fallen twigs and berries saved

Well, don?t be scared of avalanches
Tucked up in my snowy branches
I will
Oh I will
Oh I will
I will keep you safe

The sun is overhead and you lift your face
Up to the sky and you sing this place
The sweetest song it's ever known
Then slowly the deer and the rabbits crept
Outside to hear, the grizzlies left
Their great big teeth and their claws
At home

Don't be scared of avalanches
Tucked up in my snowy branches, I will
And look how well the gray wolf dances
You bring light and second chances
I will
Oh I will
Oh oh I will
Oh oh I will
Oh oh I will
Yes, I will

I will
I will
Keep you safe
