WE STOOD UP

We are not frightened anymore,
we stood up, we stood up
and there are two of us there will be more,
they'll show up, yeah they'll show up
they'll show up

blame a change of mind
a seismic shift in times
they told us not to fight
but we'll fight it till we die

cos' we are not frightened anymore,
we stood up, we stood up
and there are two of us there will be more,
they'll show up, yeah they'll show up
they'll show up

and so they sunk every ship we sailed
but we stood up, we stood up
and they fought hard, but somewhere fighting failed
they're all shook up, they're all shook up
all shook up

steel and concrete break
beneath the steady waves
of fearless hope and grace
in kindness there is strength
