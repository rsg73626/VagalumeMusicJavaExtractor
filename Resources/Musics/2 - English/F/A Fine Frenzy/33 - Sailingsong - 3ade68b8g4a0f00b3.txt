SAILINGSONG

Dawn breaks on the cool waves
See the bright face of a new day

And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades away
And we?

Sail set sail
Sail set sail

Salt taste and the dolphins play games
And the sea birds race
As the old flag is raised

And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades away
And we?

Sail set sail
Sail set sail

And the weight of the world is lost
And the blues in the blue we cross
Everything gone is gone

Good man with the capable hands
Sails for new lands
And he understands

That you can?t go back
No, no you can?t go back
No you can?t look back
No, you can?t look back
When you

Sail set sail
Sail set sail
