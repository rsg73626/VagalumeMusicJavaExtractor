ELECTRIC TWIST

You should be wilder, you're no fun at all
Yeah, thanks for the input
Thanks for the call

With dull knives and white hands
The blood of a stone
Cold to the touch, right
Right down the bone

But you give me the electric twist and it kicks like a pony
And true, you might get away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk yeah

Picked from a hot grove, packaged for sale
It drips down the sleeve
Gets under your nails

A loss of the senses
A chip off a tooth
The smells of the city
They ride in your suit

He says don't think don't talk
Don't think
Don't think don't talk
Don't think
Don't think don't talk
But I don't think I want to
?cause you give me the electric twist and it kicks
like a pony
and true, you might run away with it, it's a risk it's a risk yeah

and the touch of your lips it's a shock not a kiss
it's electric twist, it's electric twist

He says don't think don't talk
Don't think
Don't think don't talk
Don't think
Don't think don't talk
But I don't think I want to
?cause you give me the electric twist and it kicks
like a pony
and true, you might run away with it, it's a risk it's a risk yeah
