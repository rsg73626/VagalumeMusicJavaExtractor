BLOW AWAY

One of us is gonna be here and
One of us is gonna be running off alone into the
great unknown
You're not me, you're a model of freedom
All you need are your kicks when you need ?em
Come and go, caught that slow alright

With one hand off the side
We get farther away in the blink of an eye

And it's the time we waste swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow away
To blow away
To blow away

Hey, hey you, yeah you gotta be leaving,
Say what you want, what you say, say anything
No one knows just how deep it goes
We are old in your teenaged tyranny
And all you need is a hunger to feed
I've got my own secrets though, say what?

With a heart full of mess and lore
We are doomed but we wanted more

It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow away
To blow away
And we blow away

One of us is now retreating
You knocked me down so hard I'm seeing a thousand
stars
Come out where you are
?Cause I won't ever be caught crying and I will
Not be taken lying down
It blows into smoke

The time we waste swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow
It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow away
To blow away
It's the times we say that no one's gonna take
your place
It's a mistake to blow away
To blow away
