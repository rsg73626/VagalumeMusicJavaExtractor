WINDS OF WANDER

Lay lazy sun
Hanging heavy up above
Drown in the drowsy afternoon
In the green grass where yellow flowers bloom
The heart beats slow
And eyes will close? they?ll close

Vise hands, loosen up the reins
That tight grasp won?t save you any pain
Rock back and forwards with your breath
From this stone house, the home you?ve never left
The heartbeat slows
And eyes will close

Learn to float
Don?t you worry so
Let the winds of wander blow
Up and away we go

Up and away we go
Where the winds of wander blow
Up and away we go
Where the winds of wander blow
