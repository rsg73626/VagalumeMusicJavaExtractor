INSIDE MY HEAD

I can hear them now 
A thousand voices inside my head 
Can you hear them now? 
Screaming loudly your name 
I can’t keep your pain 
A black poison inside my heart 
Driving me crazy 
In the abyss stands before me 

And I feel and understand 
But I don’t know where to go 
And I feel and understand 
But I don’t know where to go 

I am running fast 
In the darkness 
Hope that someone 
Stop me falling down 
And my mind is going 
Away from me 
I pray for my soul 
But no one bother me 

Crying like babes 
A thousand voices tear me inside 
Sharp like a blade 
Your anguish cut my feelings 
While I am sleeping 
Slowly comes to me and 
While I am dreaming 
She takes me all my fancy
