IN MY GRAVE

Oh my God 
I’m entrapped 
Six feet under in a grave 
I can’t breathe 
I must stand still 
Please open the coffin 

I don’t know how 
I don’t know when but 
I will return to life for my sweet revenge 
And see again the light 
I’m inside this dark and silent coffin 
Without understanding why 
I’m not ready to die! 

Damned bastard closed inside 
It’s time to die!
