AGAINST THE WIND

Marching 
To dawn from sunset 
Marching 
Under the burning sun 
Marching 
Against the wind 

We are soldiers of doom 
We fight to conquer the enemy land 
Nothing can stop us 
Marching and marching 
into the shadow, 

Marching 
To dawn from sunset 
Marching 
Under the burning sun 
Marching 
Against the wind 

Still marching altogether 
To the end of our lives 
To face certain death 
As it was ordered us 
It is an ordinary story
