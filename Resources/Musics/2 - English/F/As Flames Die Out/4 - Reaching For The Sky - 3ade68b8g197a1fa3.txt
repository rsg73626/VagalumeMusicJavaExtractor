REACHING FOR THE SKY

God please bring her back, I know it was stupid
Because she needed me, and I just disappointed her

Now I just can cry to death
No way, but I should fight for her to be alive
I threw away my life alone
I'll close my eyes and spread my broken wings to fly

(God please bring her back)
God please give me a second chance
I promise, I'll never leave her, never again
(So can you see my tears?)
It seems like blood running from veins
This could be the last time I see the light of the sun

Now I got the poison you left inside my heart
Now I got questions. Where are you now? How could I see you?
I'm crawling in the dark cause poison is getting my eyes blinded
And you're the only one who can turn the lights on

It's cold tonight, I wish I never burned that bridges 
I see an angel fly, a little voice inside my head 
Calls my name and drags me fast from somewhere I belong 
So tell me, am I going to hell?

And now I just can cry to death
No way, but I should fight for her to be alive
I threw away my life alone
I'll close my eyes and spread my wings!

(God please bring her back)
God please give me a second chance
I promise, I'll never leave her, never again
(So can you see my tears?)
It seems like blood running from my veins
This could be the last time I see the light of the sun

Now I got the poison you left inside me
Now I got questions. Where are you now? How could I see you?
I'm crawling in the dark cause poison is getting my eyes blinded
And you're the only one who can turn the lights on

You never made things easy
I wonder what I did wrong
You never tried to fix it
I can't figure it out
Why?

I'm crawling in the dark, your poison is getting my eyes blinded
And you're the only one who can turn the lights on.
