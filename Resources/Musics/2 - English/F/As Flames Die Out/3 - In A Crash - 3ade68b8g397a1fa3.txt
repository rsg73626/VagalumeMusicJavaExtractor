IN A CRASH

Everybody screaming
I try to move but I can't 
I hear so many voices
I think I broke my legs
I saw the face of death 
I can't remember what happened 
The blood is soaking my shirt
Just see the light at the end

Have you ever seen the life pass before your eyes?
Like a collage you made through your mind and heart.
Did you ever feel that everything is gonna fall apart? 
So tell me what was on your mind
Did you think you were going to die?

(Here I am waiting for a sign)
Waiting and waiting for someone to tell me what happen
Why can't I move? Did I take the wrong way again?
Why is the bottle still intact? While I'm torn to pieces
If someone wrote this story, please stop playing with pencils.

Did you ever wonder who will (cry for your death when you're gone?)
Wholl think of you all the time (remembering how did you grow?)
Your eyes remain so close cause theyre blinded by the white light
Its too late, you've lost control
Your soul wants to escape from this world

Waiting and waiting for someone to tell me what happen
Why can't I move? Did I take the wrong way again?
Why is the bottle still intact? While I'm torn to pieces
If someone wrote this story please stops playing with pencils.

Thinking (In a crash) and losing (In a crash)
Living (In a crash) the worst day of my life (In a crash)
Crying out (In a crash) and no one seems to care

In a crash
