ANOTHER HATE CONFESSION (BLENDIN' EMOTIONS)

There goes again, its my real enemy
(She knows what I feel, she knows what I did)
Splits my world from what is real
(Shes breaking all the walls that build my mind again)

I think I heard again the angry voice inside me that is
Leading me to kill, that painful words inside of them 

(Right now shes disturbing me)
I feel like my body is been hurted
(Someday this pain will grow!)
Leaded by the anger

(Just to make it disappear from me)
(Killing me is the only way to be free)

I tried another lonely night 
To die and save myself from this world 
To blend ingredients I found deep inside my pain

Another way to fly
Cause Ive got all the keys and wings
I get destroying your life and mine; I just hope to reach the sky.

Dear mom: I know I was bad, but Please forgive me, Id changed the past if it was in my hands cause you know life has not been fair to me and now it comes back asking for revenge.

You have no fucken clue of what I feel so cant you hear it like I do
Through out the night she invades my dreams
I wish it never comes true.
