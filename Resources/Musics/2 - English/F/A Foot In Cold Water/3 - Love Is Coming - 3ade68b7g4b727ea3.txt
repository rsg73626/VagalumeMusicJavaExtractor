LOVE IS COMING

Color in your eyes reflects the perfect 
Love that I long to see 
Tell me where you're going and I will follow 
Wherever it may be 

It's simple yet its sad that I can't be glad 
If you're not here with me 

I wonder if your happy so far away 
Without me 

'Cause Love Is Coming that I know 
Love Is Coming, thats for sure 

A simple song not too long is all I have to give 
Memories on a passing breeze, is that all there is ? 

'Cause Love Is Coming that I know 
Love Is Coming, thats for sure 

Don't you feel that you need my love 
Do you want to break it ? 
Its getting harder all the time 
I just can't take it 

(solo) 

Color in your eyes reflects the perfect 
Love that I long to see 
Tell me where you're going and I will follow 
Wherever it may be 

It's simple yet its sad that I can't be glad 
if you're not here with me 

I wonder if your happy so far away 
Without me 
I wonder if your happy so far away 
Without me 
without me 
Without me 
Without me
