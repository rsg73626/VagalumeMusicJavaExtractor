(ISN'T LOVE UNKIND) IN MY LIFE

No matter where I go 
It just seems to show 
I need, a helping hand 

No matter what I do 
I'm still feeling blue 
Do you know, where I can go ? 
To find the kind of love 
I've been needing for some time 

(Isn't Love Unkind) 

I thank you for showing me a way to unwind 
Something is lacking in my life 

No matter what I do 
I'm still feeling blue 
Do you know where I can go ? 
Today I'm just waiting for a change in my/our life 
Keep my eyes open for what might be 
There might be a change/chance in my life, and I know 
I've got so much love for you 

(solo) 

To find the kind of love 
I've been needing for some time 

(Isn't Love Unkind) 

I thank you for showing me a way to unwind 
Something is lacking in my life 

(Isn't Love Unkind) in your life 
(Isn't Love Unkind) in your life 
(Isn't Love Unkind) in your lives 
(Isn't Love Unkind) 
(Isn't Love Unkind) in your life
