(MAKE ME DO) ANYTHING YOU WANT

In the morning lights
Feels so good, by me
It could be so right
You and me, tonight

Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want

Work hard in the daytime
For our dinner at night
Comfort me at the right time
Everything's gonna be alright

Make me do anything you want
Make me be everything you want
Make me do anything you want

In the morning lights
Feels so good, by me
It could be so right
You and me, tonight

Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do anything you want
Make me do....
