REST FROM THE STREETS (FEAT. CARLY RAE JEPSEN)

The clock's been running fast, fast tonight
We made your love bed crash in the light
And you look perfect and I
I'm spinning around
I'm way off the ground tonight

The fire's working
I like your beat
I'm in here searching a rest from the streets
Your Emily eyes, your curvy bits
The smell of white lies
A rest from the streets

I like the firework baby
I like the way that it saves me
I like the firework baby

The clock's been running fast, fast tonight
Forget the future and the past
I'll make you feel alright
And you look perfect and I
I'm spinning around
I'm way off the ground tonight

The fire's working
I like your beat
I'm in here searching a rest from the streets
Your Emily eyes, your curvy bits
The smell of white lies
A rest from the streets

I like the firework baby
I like the way that it saves me
I like the firework baby

I like the firework baby
I like the way that it saves me
I like the firework baby yeah

The fire's working
And I like your beat
I'm in here searching a rest from the streets
Oh and your Emily eyes, and your curvy bits
The smell of white lies
A rest from the streets

I like the firework baby
I like the way that it saves me
I like the firework baby
