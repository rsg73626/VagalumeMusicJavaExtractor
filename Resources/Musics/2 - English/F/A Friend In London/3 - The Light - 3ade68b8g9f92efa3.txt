THE LIGHT

I can’t stand the light
It’s killing me inside
And I’m getting…oh well…
Out of here

The beauty of the night
Is getting out of sight
And the way I’m moving
Is not right

This is how I live
In this working seas
The clock, ticking
While the heart beats

And still the beauty of the night
Is getting out of sight
And the way I’m moving
Is just not right

And would you stay
For a while
Would you stay
For a while

I can’t stand the light
It’s killing me inside
And the way I’m moving
Is not right
