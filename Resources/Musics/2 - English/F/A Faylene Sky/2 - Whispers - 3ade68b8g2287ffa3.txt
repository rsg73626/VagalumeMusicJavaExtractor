WHISPERS

Listen for the whispers to show us the way. (the way)
Back to another place. (another place)
Where we can stay the same, stay the same.

We built our lives, with your lies.
Our throats exposed, to their knives.

We've seen and had enough, and its come to this.
They can't tell us, what to believe. believe.
They can't tell us, what to believe. believe.
We'll carry on..

We'll carry on, but its over.
Now its over. x2

Listen for the whispers to show us the way.(the way)
Back to another place.(another place)
Where we can stay the same, stay the same.

Ive seen this world, ive seen it all.
To believe I'm not alone.

(ive seen this world, ive seen enough.
To believe I'm not alone.)

And we will prosper and become the ones to show them light.
Never see, they'll never see. the plot against them.

We're side by side, with love in our hearts
We were meant for this. x2

We'll carry on, we'll carry on..

Listen to the whispers to show us the way. (the way)

Back to another place.(another place)
Where we can stay the same, stay the same.

Parasites will try again, to feed again.
But we will know, and we will know.
And it wont be long till they repeat.
