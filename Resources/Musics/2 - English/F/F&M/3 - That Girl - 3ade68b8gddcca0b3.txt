THAT GIRL

When the words she says turn out lies
And desperation fills your eyes
Hold her in your arms and don't let go
Can you taste defeat will you lose the game
Fight 'til you win don't give in
Hold her in your arms and tell her so

That girl
Always takes the best of you
That girl
Will you ever let her go

When you hear her calling out your name
Thinks about you, cries without you
Hold her in your arms and don't let go
You've tried so many times before
Smell the fear, as she closed the door
Just to hold her in your arms once more

That girl
Always takes the best of you
That girl
Will you ever let her go
That girl
Can't you see she's using you
That girl

Will you ever let her go
When the words she says turn out lies
And desperation fills your eyes
Hold her in your arms and don't let go

That girl
Always takes the best of you
That girl
Will you ever let her go
That girl
Don't you kow she's gonna break your heart

That girl
That girl, that girl
That girl, that girl
Don't let her go
That girl, that girl
