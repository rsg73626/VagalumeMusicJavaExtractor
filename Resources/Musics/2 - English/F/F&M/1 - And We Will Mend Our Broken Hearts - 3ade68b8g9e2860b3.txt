AND WE WILL MEND OUR BROKEN HEARTS

I was in the background sitting sorta softly in my shell
Humming slowly sipping, sipping on a drink I will dwell
Dim the lights, turn on the stereo
I place my hand in yours it's on your lap

Take your eyes off mine, turn them to the street down below
People flashing by, people flashing by their in our eyes
Most days we always rush but not today

Pour another glass, I choose to stay

Saunter in the streets, Saunter in my mind, I saunter well
Saunter with a hat, Saunter in a scarf, I wear it well
People buzzing past that's not my way
People fussing much it's not my way

And I'm standing in the rain, as It hits the dirty ground
It cleans the filthy streets
And I'm picturing your face
It's a painting that I trace, you're always on my mind

And we will mend our broken hearts
In a year of broken dreams, a year of broken words we heard

And we're fading into black
Fading into black... fade the lights to black
