WORDS

Words don't come easy to me.
How can I find a way
To make you see - I love you?
Words don't come easy.

Words don't come easy to me.
this is the only way for me to say
I love you, words don't come easy.
Well, I'm just a music man

Melody was so far my best friend,
But my words are calling I'm wrong
And I, I reveal my heart to you
And hope that you believe it's true - 'cause

Words don't come easy to me.
How can I find a way to make you see
I love you, words don't come easy.
This is just a simple song

That I've made for you on my own.
There's no hidden meaning, you know
And I - when I say I love you, honey,
Please believe - I really do - 'cause.

Words don't come easy to me.
How can I find a way to make you see
I love you, words don't come easy.
It isn't easy, words don't come easy.

Words don't come easy to me.
How can I find a way to make you see
I love you; words don't come easy,
Don't come easy to me.

This is the only way for me to say -
I love you; words don't come easy
Words don't come easy.
