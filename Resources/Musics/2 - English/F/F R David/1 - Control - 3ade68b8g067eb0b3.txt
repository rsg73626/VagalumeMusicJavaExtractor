CONTROL

Crazy love
That's what we got
Oh when we started I thought I was
The one on top
Now I find
As time has passed
Love doesn't care who come first
Or who comes last

She got control of me
She got a hold on me
She doesn't even know
If I let it show
How deep she gets inside
She got control of me
The things she's showing me
Are turning loose all of
The things I used to hold inside

Crazy love
That's what we got
We keep on going never knowing
Why it's gotta stop
To let someone else
Take the wheel from you
Do all the drivin' and arrive
At a place so new

She got control of me
She got hold on me
She doesn't even know
If I let it show
How deep she gets inside

She got control of me
She got hold on me
She doesn't even know
If I let it show
How deep she gets inside

She got control of me
The things she's showing me
Are turning loose all of
The things I used to hold inside
