MUSIC

Music you're making me blue
While I'm alone without you
Fill my heart and fill my soul
With tenderness
Music fill my loneness

Music is still all around
It's time for changing all the sounds
How about your inspiration
It'll never end
Seasons all will choke a man

(chorus)
When spring is near the end
I hear reliefs of summer
Autumn brings rhythm of the rain
Then it's hazy shade of winter

Music I love you so true
I'm just crazy about you
Without you I'd feel so sad
And full of pain
Music please come back again

(chorus)

Music you're making me blue
While I'm alone without you
Fill my heart and fill my soul
With tenderness
Music fill my loneness

Fill my heart and fill my soul
With tenderness
Music fill my loneness
