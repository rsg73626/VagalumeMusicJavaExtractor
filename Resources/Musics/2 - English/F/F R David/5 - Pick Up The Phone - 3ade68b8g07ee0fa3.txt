PICK UP THE PHONE

Said goodbye when I left
To your answering machine
Then you jumped in a plane
Girl, you know what I mean

Pick up the phone, oh yeah
Pick up the phone, oh please
I need your voice again
Hearing your voice again

Waiting so many years
Feeling closer to you
Not a sign, not a trace
Baby, what can I do?
Pick up the phone, oh yeah
Pick up the phone, oh please
I need your voice again
Hearing your voice again

Pick me the phone
Let me know
I don't want to lose you, girl
Don't hang up, get in touch
Fill the shadow in my life
What you're doing to me now

Intercommunication via satellite
You can call me long distance
Whatever you like
Pick up the phone, oh yeah
Pick up the phone, oh please
I need your voice again
Hearing your voice again

Pick me the phone
Let me know
I don't want to lose you, girl
Don't hang up, get in touch
Fill the shadow in my life
What you're doing to me now

What you're doing to me now
Can't we straight in it out?
Won't you speak your heart
What you're doing to me now
Can't we straight in it out?
Won't you speak your heart.
