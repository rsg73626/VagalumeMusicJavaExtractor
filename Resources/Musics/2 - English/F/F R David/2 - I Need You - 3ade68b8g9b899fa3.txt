I NEED YOU

If you change
change your mind
if you think it's worth it
Just call me
you'll find me - I need you.
If you get mistreated
if your heart is bleeding
I still want you so bad - I need you.

I tell you words that no one will hear
Make a diamond out of tears believe me.
Forget it all it will break your heart. Come to me and trust in me baby
You will never find a love like mine.
I need you, I need you
if you think it's worth it
Day and night I'll be there - I need you.
If you get mistreated if your heart is bleeding
I still want you so bad - I need you.

You'll never find a love like mine.
I need you. I need you
if you think it's worth it
Day and night I'll be there - I need you.

I need you, I need you
if you think it's worth it
Day and night I'll be there - I need you.
If you get mistreated, if your heart is bleeding
I still want you so bad - I need you.
