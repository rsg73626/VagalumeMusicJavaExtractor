LONG DISTANCE FLIGHT

I see the rising sun
This is a special day
Driving my car
Already on my way
 
You travel in the night
Gliding over the earth
Long distance flight
I think of her
 

You're flying high
High in the sky
Over the clouds
Bright shooting star
You're flying high
High in the sky
Oh you're coming back
 

The highway's coming fast
Rushing under my wheels
Somewhere up there
You're heading back to me
 

I want to hold you tight
I got so much to say
Long distance flight
I think of her
