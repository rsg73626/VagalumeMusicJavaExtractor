NO SUBSTITUTE LOVE - ESTELLE

You know who it is
Oh boy Oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover (said I'm not)
Said boy I'm not your substitute lover

I know it would have been nice if I could have had
your body
Knowing that everybody ain't been with you
But you told me lies you made me give my heart away
But now I know the games you play
So I'm thru with you

Oh boy oh boy
I'm not your substitue lover oh no
Said boy oh boy I'm not your sub lover oh no

You know there's gonna be a fight if these chicks keep calling you at night
I see that text you're tryin to hide see I know the truth
Must be outta your mind you thought you'd never see the day
You thought I'd let a player play but Imma upgrade you, listen boy

Oh boy oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover oh no
Said boy oh boy I'm not your sub lover oh no

See there's not much you can say
He said he's done changed and I finished today
Cus I can't do it no more I will be there when you
call
So you besta move on (move on)
Because I couldn't be your sub anymore

Listen, I see you called my name like I'm going outta fashion
And turn around and act like nutting ain't happen
Like nar nuttins crackin
Only when you need a chick only when you think about dis
Hotness you get itch
That's when you get the itch baby let me be a bitch
Boy who you think you is Bad gal nar tek dis
Actin like a little boy play me like a decoy
You need to grow a couple boy

(You ain't bout nuttin boy)

Oh boy oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover oh no
Say boy oh boy I'm not your sub lover oh no

Oh boy oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover oh no
Say boy oh boy I'm not your sub lover oh no
