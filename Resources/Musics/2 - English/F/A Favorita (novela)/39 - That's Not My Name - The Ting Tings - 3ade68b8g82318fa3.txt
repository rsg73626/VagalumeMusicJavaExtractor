THAT'S NOT MY NAME - THE TING TINGS

Four letter word just to get me along 
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue and I 
I keep stalling, keeping me together 
People around gotta find something to say now 

Holding back, everyday the same 
Don't wanna be a loner 
Listen to me, oh no 
I never say anything at all 
But with nothing to consider 
They forget my name (ame, ame, ame) 

They call me 'hell' 
They call me 'Stacey' 
They call me 'her' 
They call me 'Jane' 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 

They call me 'quiet girl' 
But I'm a riot 
Maybe 'Joleisa' 
Always the same 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 

I miss the catch if they through me the ball 
I'm the last kid standing up against the wall 
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring 
Getting glammed up and sitting on the fence now 

So alone all the time at night 
Lock myself away 
Listen to me, I'm not 
Although I'm dressed up, out and all with 
Everything considered 
They forget my name (ame, ame, ame) 

They call me 'hell' 
They call me 'Stacey' 
They call me 'her' 
They call me 'Jane' 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 

They call me 'quiet girl' 
But i'm a riot 
Maybe 'Joleisa' 
Always the same 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 
That's not my name 

Are you calling me darling? 
Are you calling me bird? 
Are you calling me darling? 
Are you calling me bird?
