SWEET ABOUT ME - GABRIELLA CILMI

Ohh watching me, hanging by a string this time. 
Ohh easily, the climax of the perfect lie. 
Ohh watching me, hanging by a string this time. 
Ohh easily, smile worth a hundred lies. 

If there's lessons to be learned, 
I'd rather get my
jamming words in first 
so tell you something that
I've found, that the world's 
a better place when it's
upside down boy. 

If there's lessons to be learned, 
I'd rather get my
jamming words in first so, 
when you're playing with desire, 
don't come running to my place 
when it burns like fire boy. 

(Chorus:)
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 

Blue, blue, blue, waves they crash as time goes by
So hard to catch
Too, too smooth, ain't all that, why
Don't you ride on my side of the tracks. 

If there's lessons to be learned, 
I'd rather get my jamming words in first 
So, when you're playing with desire, 
Don't come running to my place 
When it burns like fire boy

(Chorus:)
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
(fading out) 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh 
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, Yehh
