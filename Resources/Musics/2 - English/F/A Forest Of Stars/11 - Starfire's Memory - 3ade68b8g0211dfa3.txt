STARFIRE'S MEMORY

Dusk, she is the calming influence, making ends meet in a place of concentric corners.
She cleanses these gutters with her utmost purity. Onrushing dark leaves your false light lonely.
Her frozen kiss devoid of apology. Setting cleansing fires to guide the rest of us through the night by.
When we once again arrive in struggling shine of dawn, memories of her ice shall gird us on our way...
For all the friends we left behind, for lost summers and eyes gone blind. For the kiss of blade on desperate flesh, for light shrouded only in funeral dress. For all tears mingled with bad blood, awaiting sentencing for hearts taken, but not understood.
For all mislaid foundation stones, for all smiles cracked wide open. For all beauty turned to ash, for all flames in deluge doused. For all fear all encompassing.
One for sorrow. Two to destroy.
