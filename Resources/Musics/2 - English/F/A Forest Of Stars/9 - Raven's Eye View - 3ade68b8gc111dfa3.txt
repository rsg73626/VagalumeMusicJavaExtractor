RAVEN'S EYE VIEW

I won't just steal your thunder, I'll have your lightning as well.
As crushing blow of hammer, annihilating those grating steeple bells. As hairline cracks to fragments!
Standing up on high, spraying golden rain down on to the waiting faces of you pious, worthless swine...
Hear my sermon splashing down all around you, children. We would not even waste one single match on you trough-fed, hook-lined, soul-sunk bottom-feeders. Never mind chapter and so-called verse.
I shall instead content myself with loosing my bowels upon youâ€“ to drown your herd in a flurry of slurry. Soul starved bodies crushed, throats stuffed with my falling angels.
Yours, in mocking memory! After all, you are only worthwhile as fertilizer...
To the gallows with your lack of humour! You, who do not play well with words!
Hammer blow upon hammer blow. Hammer blow upon hammer blow. Upon Eternity's Anvil!
