FEMALE

The moon pushed the sun down the spiral-staircase of time
Bright neck broken, twisted beyond repair
So now there's only darkness standing there
Arms outstretched/predatory parasite
Vacant light
From the tunnel of night.

It's colder here since the war, all colours took on a shade of grey
The streams have run slower since you went away
Even the summer is slouching now
Sun not waxing, but waning - walking disappointedly away
Moon with no hope of saving the day

-It's time I remembered that I have forgotten-

Rainy season beyond sense and reason
Endless sheets of glass
Streets awash with horror
Bullets in the back of summer
Filthy water everywhere
Not saved by incantations

Summer sun always gone
Left my smile all alone back there
Forced to simply sit and stare
At nothing
Nothing

Summer's always gone
Temperance overrule
Temper under ruled
Time - Oh, she's short
Wait - Oh, she's long
Where she went I'll never know
All I know
Is she's gone
Gone?
