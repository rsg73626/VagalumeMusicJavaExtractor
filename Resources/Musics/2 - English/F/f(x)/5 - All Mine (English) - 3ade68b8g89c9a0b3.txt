ALL MINE (ENGLISH)

Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine

My heart isn't acting like I want
The sound of my heartbeat gets faster
I can't talk the way that I want
I can't follow my heart
Baby Baby when I look into your eyes
My heart jumps over the wall of time and space
I'll hold you in my arms and dive

All Mine, the rainbow
All Mine, the ocean
All Mine, even the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine

All Mine, the whole world
Your lips bring magic
A fantasy has bloomed (a picture of a dream)
Hold it tight in your small hands
Without knowing (My Heart)
With scented words
You whispered in my ears
All the fantasies that I see right
It's all mine
Baby Baby, hold tight to my hand
We're jumping over the wall of time and space
Hold my hand and fly

All Mine, the white cloud
All Mine, the wind
All Mine, even the scent

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine
Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine

It's a love that I dreamed of
Above the sky, the end of the ocean, wherever I look
It's so beautiful
I can't take my eyes off of it
It spreads even in my dream
My heart flutters all night, can't fall asleep
Please be forever
Even if I close my eyes

All Mine, your voice
All Mine, your eyes
All Mine, even your embrace
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine
Your love brings magic
A fantasy has bloomed (a picture of a dream)
Hold it tight in your small hands
Without knowing (My Heart)

Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh All Mine
