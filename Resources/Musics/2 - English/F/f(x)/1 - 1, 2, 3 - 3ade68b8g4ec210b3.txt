1, 2, 3

1 step more, 2 3 4
Love's around the corner!
Left and right, by your side
Boy you're getting warmer!

Up the street, move your feet
See you coming closer
You better run to my door
Into my arms, say you're mine forever more!

Ooh~ yeah!

You better run to my door
Into my arms, say you're mine forever more!

Don't act so shy boy
There's no need to play coy
Tell me why you leave me hanging
Why you taking so long?

You keep me waiting
And anticipating
Open up your heart and tell me
I'm the one you adore

So 1 2 3, i put a spell on you
That's what i gotta do
So you can finally see that
You belong with me!

Got no time to waste
No hesitation
I can't stop dreaming
Some day you will feel the way i'm feeling now, hey!

See you coming closer
You better run to my door
Into my arms, say you're mine forever more!

Ooh~ yeah!

You better run to my door
Into my arms, say you're mine forever more!

Say: 1 2 3
Won't you stay with me?
Complete our destiny
When you hear me calling, you should hurry!

There's nothing you can do
No turning back, cause
It's now or never
And if the fates allow, we'll be together now!

Mountain high, valley low
I know you will find me
Ocean wide, flowing tide
It won't stop my baby

Step by step, in your stride
One for every heartbeat
Come to me, set me free
I hear you knocking at my door~

Doo doo do doo doo doo doo
Oh, lalalalala

You better run to my door
Into my arms, say you're mine forever more!
