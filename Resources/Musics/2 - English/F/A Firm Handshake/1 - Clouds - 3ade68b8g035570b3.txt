CLOUDS

I fell down, down, down into this dark and lonely hole
There was no one there to care about me anymore
And I needed a way to climb and grab a hold
On the edge you were sitting there holding a rope
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear, it won't be long now
It won't be long now

When we get back on land but I'll never get my chance
Be ready to live and it'll be ripped right out of my hands
And maybe some day we'll take a little ride
Go up, up, up and everything will be just fine
We'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear, it won't be long now
It won't be long now

If only I had a little bit more time
If only I had a little bit more time with you
We could go up, up, up and then take that little ride
We'll sit there holding hands
And everything will be just right
And maybe someday I'll see you again

We'll float up in the clouds
And we'll never see the end
We'll go up, up, up but I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear, it won't be long now
It won't be long now
