YOU'RE MINE

I'd like to know you
Much better than I do
I'd like to show you
Everything you need to know

I'd like to wrap you
Tightly in my arms
To keep you safe and
Free from all the harm

Baby I will never hurt you
I will never make you cry
Never leave you or desert you
You know why

I'd like to take you
Although I'm far away
You know I love you
For this, forever and one day

Baby I will never hurt you
I will never make you cry
Never leave you or desert you
'Cause you're mine

Oooh, la la la la la la
You're mine
Woah, woah oh-hoh
La la la la la la la la la
You're mine

Baby I will never hurt you
I will never make you cry
Never leave you or desert you
'Cause you're mine

Oooh, la la la la la la
You're mine
Woah, woah oh-hoh
La la la la la la la la la
You're mine
Woah, woah oh-hoh
La la la la la
You're mine girl
Woah, woah oh-hoh
La la la la la la la la la
You're mine
