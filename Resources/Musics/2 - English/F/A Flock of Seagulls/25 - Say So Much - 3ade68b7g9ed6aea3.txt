SAY SO MUCH

Young girl I saw you walking right up my stair
Your eyes are making promises that you can't keep
There you go sweeping to the rhythm of some unknown beat
I love the way you body tell me cause it says so much

Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much
Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much

Wish I could take you home and lay you in my bed
Wish I could teach you all the thing you mother never did
And every morning I could give you sweet champagne
I love the way you body talks cause it says so much

Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much
Oohh so much
So, so, so, so

Your just sweet sixteen
And I still love you
Your just sweet sixteen

Oohh your stay nervous child
Make love to me
Before I die
Oohh your stay nervous child
Make love to me
Before I die

When I look in you eyes
Doesn't need to be shy
No more need to fantasize
Let your body talk to me

Cause it says so much
Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much
Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much

Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much
Oohh so much
So, so, so, so much
