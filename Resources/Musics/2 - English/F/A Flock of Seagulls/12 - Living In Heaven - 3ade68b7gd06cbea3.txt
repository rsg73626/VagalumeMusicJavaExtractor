LIVING IN HEAVEN

So tell me how does it feel?
You're at the end of your time
No future, no past
No reason, no rhyme
All you friends will arrive
So you have nothing to fear
And you think your desire
Is already up here

How does it feel?
How does it feel?

You got your head in the clouds
Yes, you're walking on air
You can forget all your worries
You can forget all your cares
Touch the wings of an angel
Everything becomes clear
Touch my heart and discover
When you're living up here

Living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven

So how does it feel
When you find all your dreams
Intertwining up lovers
Spinning wheels within wheels
With just one look in your eyes
With just a touch of your hands
All the walls they will come down
Turn your body to sand

Living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
You're living in Heaven
