THE STORY OF A YOUNG HEART

This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
It only seems like yesterday
We were walking in the rain
It only seems that our own soul
Since I looked into your soul
Is tearing me apart
To tell the story of the young heart
The story of the young heart
It only seems that we got to say
Maybe it's been near two years
Since we were burning down the days
Neither happiness nor tears
The story in your eyes
Is the story of the young heart
The story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart
This is the story of the young heart (this is the story)
This is the story of the young heart
You know they gotta break your young heart (this is the story)
This is the story of the young heart
