SAY YOU LOVE ME

Say you love me
Come on say you do
Say you need me
Just like i need you

It's in your eyes
I see it in your smile
Say you love me
If only for a while

Won't waste my time
On other love
If you were mine, lord above
I still remember

When our eyes first met
There's something about you
That i just can't forget

You made my heart
Into an open door
Say you need me
Can't take it anymore

Don't waste your time
On other love
When you are mine, lord above
My heart's been tossed

Like a ship on the ocean
I'm beaten and driven
On waves of emotion
That carry me

Carry me
Carry me
On to your shore
You stand like a statue
Of pure alabaster
Surrounded by sirens
On rock of disaster

They're calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Into your heart
Where i'm torn apart
Say you love me
Come on say you do
Say you need me

Don't treat me like a fool
It's in your eyes
I know it's in your touch
Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
