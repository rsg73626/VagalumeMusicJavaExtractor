BURNIN' UP

You cut me to the wire
You shook me to the bone
My object of desire
Don't leave my heart alone
With one look in your eyes
I saw the raging fire
I'm burnin' up I'm burnin' up
With such desire
Took one step in the dark
Across forbidden lines
Into the danger zone
You took my mind
But you make me feel like I'm on fire
You make me feel like I'm alive
Love knocked me at the door
Pinned me up against the wall
You said you play with fire
You're gonna fall
I took one look in your eyes
Across the danger line
Now I'm burnin' up
Love's blind
