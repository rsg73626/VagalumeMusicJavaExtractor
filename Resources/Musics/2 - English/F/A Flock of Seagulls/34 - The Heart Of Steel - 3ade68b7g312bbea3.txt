THE HEART OF STEEL

Heart of steel
Heart of stone
What I feel
I don't know
You can turn water
Into wine
You can make a hell
Out of this paradise
With your heart of steel
A heart of steel
Breaks a heart of glass
What I need
I don't breathe to ask
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
Behind a heart of gold
You can say
What you want to
You can fly high
Where the angels sing
You can be
Anything that you want to
Where the captive ego brings
You can stay
If you want to
You can hide
Behind your angel's smile
You can make
Anything that you want
A heart of steel refuses you
A heart of steel refuses
A heart of steel refuses you
A heart of steel refuses
A heart of steel refuses
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
Becomes a heart of stone
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
The heart of steel
The heart
