SUICIDE DAY

I've got a question
I've got a question you should know
Give me the answer
Give me the answer for my sobs
Give me a reason, it's for the things you said and done
Give me the answer
Why did you leave me alone
You got to tell me
You got to tell me what's gone wrong
Give me an idea so I can carry on
Haven't got a reason for the crying
Haven't got a reason for the pain
Haven't got a reason for you lying
C'mon and tell me
C'mon and tell me what's gone wrong
Why did you use me
Why did you use me up to now
We had a wild heart
We had a love that was so strong
C'mon and tell me so I can carry on
Haven't got a reason for the crying
Haven't got a reason for the pain
Haven't got a reason for even living
One more day
I need an answer
Give me the answer to my praying
I need to hold you
I turn around and you're not there
C'mon and tell me
That what you did was planned
Why don't you want me now
I just don't understand
Haven't got a reason for the crying
Haven't got a reason for the pain
Haven't got a reason for even living
One more day
Suicide day
Suicide day
Suicide day
Suicide day
Suicide day
Suicide day
Suicide day
