COMMITTED

Take your time for book changing before rearranging
Don't you know that it's cold in here
It's been a long time since I've heard from you there
Let me tell you about the place I live
Four walls and a wooden fence
I get a letter from you every week
You want to tell me it's a recommence
When you're committed there's a hole in the wall
Committed
And I'm bustling it all
Committed
There's a hole in your head
Committed
Makes me wish I was dead
Every day I walk in the field
I see the grass and the trees so real
I look up at the sky so blue
I wonder why I never hear from you
Well I'm committed
There's a whole in the wall
Committed
And I'm bustling it all
Committed
There's a hole in your head
Makes me wish I was dead
Every day I exercise
In a yard with a big high wall
There's a man with a nice green coat
He gets his pencils and he makes a note
And I'm committed
There's a hole in the wall
Committed
And I'm bustling it all
Committed
Like a hole in your head
Committed
Makes me wish I was dead
Committed
Committed
Committed
Committed
Committed
Committed
