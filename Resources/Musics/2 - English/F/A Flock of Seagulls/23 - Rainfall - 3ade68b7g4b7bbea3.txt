RAINFALL

Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
Like crystal teardrops to the floor
It's even raining in my heart
I'll close my eyes and let it pour
Now see how the rain falls
Now see how the rain falls

And in the darkness of the night
A trace was left by your perfume
The only thing you couldn't take
Are the golden memories of you
Now see how the rain falls
Now see how the rain falls

Across an ocean wide a voice that calls your name
A love that never dies like an eternal flame
Across the great divide for all eternity
Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine
Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
But now the sun shines high above
And I won't miss you anymore
'Cos I've found another love
Now see how the rain falls
Now see how the rain falls
