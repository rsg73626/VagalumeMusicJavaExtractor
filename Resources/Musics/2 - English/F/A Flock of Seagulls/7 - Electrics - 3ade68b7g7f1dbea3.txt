ELECTRICS

I've got information,
'something you should hear,
Electrical motion
Is in the atmosphere.
Something in the air has
Given me a scare,
Electric in my fingers,
Electric in my hair.
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Thinking of the future,
Living in the past,
Electric interference,
Disturbance from the blast.
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
Electrics ev'ry where
