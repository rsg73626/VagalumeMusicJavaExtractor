THE END

It's five o'clock in the morning,
Where the hell have you been ?
I've been watching I've been waiting
Six times I've read this magazine
Looking out the window
Walking down the long and lonely road
Is there something happening
Is there something that I should know
Should I stay should I go

It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me

Oh baby we should talk it over
Maybe we can work it out
I haven't really got an answer
so tell me what do I do now

It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
It's alright when you say you love me
Standing up on the fourteenth floor

looking at the dirty street below
I've been hanging out for years
thinking it's time I let you go
So go on your way
This is the end
