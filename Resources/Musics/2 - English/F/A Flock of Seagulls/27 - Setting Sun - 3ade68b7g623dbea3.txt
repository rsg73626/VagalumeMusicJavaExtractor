SETTING SUN

I don't wanna lose control
Of this beating heart
Never wanna let you go
Loved you from the very very start

I don't really understand
I love your eyes so blue
I'll take it to the very end
I wanna give my life to you

My poor heart was true
As true as setting sun
Making love to you
Meant you and I were one

I never wanna see you sad
I will never make you cry
I never gonna make you bad
For you I'll take the stars out of the sky

My poor heart was true
As true as setting sun
Making love to you only you yeah you
Meant you and I were one
We were one
We were one

My poor heart was true
As true as setting sun
Setting sun
Setting sun

Making love to you only you yeah you
Meant you and I were one
My poor heart was true
As true as setting sun
Setting sun
Setting sun

Making love to you only you yeah you
Meant you and I were one
We were one
We were one

I don't wanna lose control
(I don't wanna lose control)
I wanna set you free
(girl I want to set You free now now)
Only wanna make you hot
(only wanna make You hot)
So now you gotta bring your love to me
(now you gotta bring your love to me)
My poor heart was true
(my poor heart was true)
As true as setting sun
(I love that setting setting sun)

Making love to you only you yeah you
Meant you and I were one
We were one
We were one
My poor heart was true
(my poor heart was true)
As true as setting sun
Setting sun
Setting sun

Making love to you only you yeah you
Meant you and I were one
We were one
We were one
My poor heart was true
(my poor heart was true)
As true as setting sun
(I love that setting setting sun)

Making love to you only you yeah you
Meant you and I were one
Just like setting sun
