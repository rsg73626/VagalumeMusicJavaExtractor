(IT'S NOT ME) TALKING

I hear voices but there's no one there,
You speak to me in another language.
Computer says it's a binary code,
It's such a pity I can't understand it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

I see a ship from a golden sky,
I sent a message. Will they understand it?
Computer's ready but to overload,
This isn't happening the way I planned it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.
(sending messges)

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

I made a contact with another world,
Another being from another planet.
Another time and another place,
Another galaxy, another planet.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.
(sending messages)

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

You got me talking, talking,
Talking, talking.
You got me talking, talking,
Talking, talking.

You got me talking,

You got me talking, talking,
Talking, talking.
