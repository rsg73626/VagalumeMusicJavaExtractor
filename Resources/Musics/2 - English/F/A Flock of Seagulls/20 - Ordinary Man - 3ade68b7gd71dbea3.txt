ORDINARY MAN

wasting your life away in a factory
doesn't make it right
there's a price to pay for what you need
so you better start to fight
you have the eyes to see what's going down
but you can tell if it's a lie
if you had the power to change this world around
would the innocent still die
but I'm just an ordinary man
I'm doing everything I can
I just want to raise my family
I'm just an ordinary man
are you blinded by what you see on the TV screen
to the devils and their plans
does the blood of a dying man
or a starving child wash right off your hands
but I'm just an ordinary man
I'm doing everything I can
I just want to raise my family
yes I'm just an ordinary guy
and I'm not reaching for the sky
it don't make no difference to me
but I'm just an ordinary man
I just want to raise my family
yes I'm just an ordinary guy
and I'm not reaching for the sky
it don't make no difference you see
cause I'm just an ordinary man
something you'll never understand
why can't you just let me be
I'm just an ordinary man
