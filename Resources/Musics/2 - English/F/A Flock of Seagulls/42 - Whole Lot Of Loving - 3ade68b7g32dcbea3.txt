WHOLE LOT OF LOVING

It takes a whole lot of loving
To keep you by my side
If you can understand what I'm trying to say
Well you know how I try
It takes a whole lot of loving
To make you feel like I do
I know you can understand you don't feel the same
I never expect that you do
I've got to say if it takes all day
It takes a whole lot of loving
It takes a whole lot of loving
Well we've got a love you can't find everyday
So don't throw it away
It takes a whole lot of loving
To make this world go round
Maybe one day you'll look in your eyes
And you will see what I found
I read the papers everyday
Of people throwing their love away
You don't want to join that fight
You'll lose all love that feels so right
I ask people everywhere
Give your love and show you care
What I really got to say
I need you love right away
A whole lot of loving
Makes the world go round
A whole lot of loving
Can't you see what I found
If you understand what I'm trying to say
Oh baby please please please
Don't throw it away
Oh oh oh oh
I need a whole lot of loving
I need a whole lot of loving
We got a love you don't find everyday
Well baby please please
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away
I read the papers everyday
I read the papers everyday
Of people throwing their love away
Of people throwing their love away
I find people everywhere
You gotta give your love
Show you care
You gotta give your love
Show you care
Oh oh oh
Oh baby please please please
You gotta give it to me
A whole lot of loving
A whole lot of loving
A whole lot of loving
Don't throw it away
I got love you got love we got love we all got love
