MAGIC

magic magic magic
is that magic
is that magic
another lonely day another lonely night
here we go again out of touch and out of sight
this is the story of a boy meeting a girl
lost and alone in a great brave world
lonely downhearted feeling the pain
I never thought I could be this way
it doesn't matter what you say
it doesn't matter what you do
you feel the thunder
then you're under the spell
and only time will tell
if it's magic magic magic
I'm talking in my sleep
living in a dream
first you cast your spell
one kiss and I fell
now only time will tell
if it's magic magic magic
all my life I was waiting for a girl like you
now that you're here what can I do
since you came along you said it all
how was I to know that I could fall
into your magic magic magic
only time will tell
