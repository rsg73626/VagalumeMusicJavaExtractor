NEVER AGAIN (THE DANCER)

I walked alone through the city streets
I hear the shadows calling my name
Lost in the glow of the neon lights
My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

Dancing alone under the cloudy moon
Feeling the rhythm, feeling the heat
No one can see all the tears I cried
Dancing alone, lost to the beat

My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again for the dancer
I am the dancer
I'm the dancer
I am the dancer

Dancing alone here in this crowded room
Millions of faces, but no one I see
Dancing alone, the shadows call too soon
My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

I'm just a dancer...wo oh...wo oh oh
I'm just a dancer who needs more...wo oh
I'm dancing in and out of time
You keep me waiting on the line...wo oh
I am the dancer

My heart is calling
Say you will answer me
Never again

I'm just a dancer...wo oh...wo oh oh
I'm just a dancer who needs more...wo oh
I'm dancing in and out of time
You keep me waiting on the line...wo oh
I am the dancer
I am the dancer
I am the dancer
I am the dancer
I am the dancer...
