EUROPEAN (I WISH I WAS)

I wish I was
A European
I wish I had
European style
Designer cars
And that way of living
With burning eyes
I could watch you smile

I wish I was
An Afghan
Standing on a hill
Spear and shield in hand
I wish I had
Black zulu pride
And maybe then
I wouldn't need to hide

I wish I was
A better man
But as it is
This is how I stand
So don't you leave me alone
Fighting for the cause
Do I stand alone
When that cause is yours

A European...
