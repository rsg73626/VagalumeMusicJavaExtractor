WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

You're giving me a hard time.
What am I supposed to do with a hard time,
Especially from you?
The way that you smile
Reveals a shadow from the past
When I thought I knew you,
but you lied.

If I see you walking,
If I see you talking,
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?

You say it's over this time,
Emotions in the past.
Remeber last time?
You said it wouldn't last.
The look in your eyes,
Another shadow from the past
When I thought I knew you,
Don't know why.

If I see you walking,
If I see you talking,
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
Yea!

The way that you smile
Reveals a moment that can't last.
I hear the door close.
Goodbye.

If I see you walking,
If I see you talking,
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
Yea!
