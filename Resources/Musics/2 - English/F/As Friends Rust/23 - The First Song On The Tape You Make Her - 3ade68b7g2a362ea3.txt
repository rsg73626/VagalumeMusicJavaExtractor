THE FIRST SONG ON THE TAPE YOU MAKE HER

You are the only good suggestion. 
Truth in an age of question. 
And in my compassless digression, 
you give me sense of direction. 
I got it bad for you. 
So bad for you. 
The naughty what nots for you. 
A deep soft spot for you. 
I wasn't sure how I should tell you, 
and all my other ideas fell through. 
This is the best way I could tell you... 
you look like Love. 
So just pop it in and play. 
I'll be around in a couple of days to find out if you feel the same way. 
You look like Love. 
There is no greater weapon than her name. 
No chemical toxin quite the same.
