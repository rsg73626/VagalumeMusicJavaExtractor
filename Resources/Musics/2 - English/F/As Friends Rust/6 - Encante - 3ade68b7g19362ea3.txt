ENCANTE

As the evening rolled, we couldn't wipe the smiles from our faces if we'd wanted to... but you had a different plan, involving words. You spoke of gold, but offered only coal. We are fighting ourselves, and we love to lose. I refuse to head down this road again. I found no verity in their bloated maxim... they are just sounds that shape lives. She did it again. Slice the lie, dice the lie... until I'm left with sand. Too late for apprehension. Feel at home within the stone, don't you? You don't have to say for me to know it, you don't have to draw. As the evening rolled, we finally wiped the smiles from our faces. It wasn't as hard as we'd thought all the while. Erase you from this day, you made it ugly, anyway.
