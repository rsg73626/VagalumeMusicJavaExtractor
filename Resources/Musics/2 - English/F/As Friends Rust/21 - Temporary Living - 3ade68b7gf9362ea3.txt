TEMPORARY LIVING

Temporary living for a temporary life.
( I thought you knew ) Temporary living.
Blanketed in bubble wrap, kept my heart in a doggie bag.
9 to 5 in the portolet, hold my zip-loc dreams while I styrofoam.
Opened up the mail-order wife with a plastic knife and she mp3'd.
She was beautiful, like one of them Real Dolls.
Laid down the terrycloth on the astro-turf.
Set up the paper plates, the inflatable dates, for a rewinded picnic.
Can't keep a love like this just anywhere.
Gotta keep a love like this in tupperware.
It's temporary living for a temporary life.
