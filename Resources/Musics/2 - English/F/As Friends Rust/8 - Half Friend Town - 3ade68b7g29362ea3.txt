HALF FRIEND TOWN

Here it is I hide,
independently confined to this Half Friend Town.
Prisoner where I reside,
cower from the Gainesville eye.
Welcome to Half Friend Town.
And we all know what that means.
It means giving up and selling out on all of our dreams.
Here I think in song,
here I speak freely of my flaws (and my excesses).
I pray it won't be long.
I pray I will move on,
while the rest regress.
Out-punk or punk out.
Those are your only options here.
