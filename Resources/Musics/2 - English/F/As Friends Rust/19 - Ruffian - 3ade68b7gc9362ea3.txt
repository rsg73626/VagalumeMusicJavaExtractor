RUFFIAN

Ruffian, bear your scar. So you came to prove your might, and it's such a brutal sight. Jab right, left, uppercut... and on your face is pure delight. You are the ones too hard to back from any fight, and yet you never grow older. so stop denying there's war in every breath. You know what's right Why are you here (macho fuckhead)? Either keep your hands in your pockets, or don't show up at all. You're tearing apart my dream. Unlike you, I still have faith... so don't come screwing it up for the rest of us. This place is only for those who are concerned. You're pushing them away, you won't turn me away. It's all testosterone... go!
