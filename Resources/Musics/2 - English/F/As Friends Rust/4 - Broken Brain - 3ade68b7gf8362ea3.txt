BROKEN BRAIN

Holy Shit, I think we've gone too far to turn back now. There's no thread to mend this tear, so now your face just turns to stone. I've gotta let it waste away, become a remnant of a dead age. No rejection, you always saved the day.... came flying out to me, untied me from the tracks. Wasn't my intention, but I've got no room for you. Me wait for light turn green, and then me go again. I'm sorry. I'll go. Without warning came this feeling lacking reason, just the kind I hate. Found no good strategy for change. I can tell you now that I am broken brain. Got a fist full of hair, so now me go again. I can tell where I stand. I can tell where. I can tell.
