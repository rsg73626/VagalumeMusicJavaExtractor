THE MOST AMERICANEST

I'm gonna be red, white and bluer then you.
I'm gonna be the proud and the fewer than you.
The most star-spangledest you ever knew.
I'm the most Americanest ( Americanist ).
When we become afraid,
will we admit to the role we play in these darkened days ?
The folly of all world leaders, the blessed and the damned, bottom-feeders.
Apathetic, untill the things we've ignored come knocking at our door.
I'm gonna snatch you right out of that fucking comfort zone.
Because the things you've ignored don't wana be ignored no more.
Wear your flag like a badge, like it matters.
You just happened to be born here.
