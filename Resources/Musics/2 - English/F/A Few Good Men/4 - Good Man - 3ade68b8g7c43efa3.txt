GOOD MAN

Baby its been too long
Since he made good love to you
Now tell me how long has it been
Well baby the feeling's gone
And there's nothing he can do
To make you feel good again

And I know that you love him
Baby but he doesn't keep it coming
If he doesn't satisfy you
Make you feel the fire
Then baby you've gotta move on

You need someone
To feel you up
You need someone
Givin it up
You need a good man

You need someone
Touching your soul
A man like me
Taking control
You need a good man

I'll love you with so much sweetness
And I'll kiss you everywhere
I'm gonna make you talk to me
Make you talk to me baby
Now once that I found your weakness
Gonna kiss you good right there
I'm gonna make you lose control

Cuz you never had another
Another who completely takes you over
Baby I can satisfy you
Make you feel the fire
Baby you better come on

You need someone
To feel you up
You need someone
Givin it up
You need a good man

You need someone
Touching your soul
A man like me
Taking control
You need a good man

Gonna lay your body down
Gonna stroke you up and down
Make you hot, hit the spot
With all that I got
Whatever you want from me

Girl I'll show you ecstasy
When you lay down next to me
I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be so damn good to you

You need someone
To feel you up
You need someone
Givin it up
You need a good man

You need someone
Touching your soul
A man like me
Taking control
You need a good man

So let me give it to you
I know you need it
I'll send it to you
I know you'll feel it baby
You need a good man
Yes you do, yes you do

I'll show it to you
I know you need it
I'll give it to you
You gotta have it
You need a good man

You need someone
To feel you up
You need someone
Givin it up
You need a good man

You need someone
Touching your soul
A man like me
Taking control
You need a good man
