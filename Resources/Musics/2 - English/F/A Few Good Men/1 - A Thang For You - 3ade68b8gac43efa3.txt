A THANG FOR YOU

A thang for you baby
I don't know what it is you do to me
Something I really like it you know

You're the kind
You're the kind
You're the kind
You're the kinda lady

Pretty lady
You look so fine yes
The way you look at me really turns me on
So what would it take for me to make you my girl
Cuz the way I feel for you is very strong

You're the kinda lady
I can call on
Who'll be there whenever I'm in need

I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong
I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong

When I'm alone
I like to dream about
Dream about me making sweet love to you
Just kissing you up and down
All over your body
And you're holding me tight
Making me come to you

You turned me out
And now you've got me under your spell

I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong
I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong

You turned me out
And now you've got me under your spell

I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong
I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong

You're making me feel so good inside
From the first moment I saw you
You make chills run up and down my body baby
And I've got a thang for you baby

I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong
I've got, a thang for you
It's very strong
