LET'S TAKE A DIP

You ready for this baby
You ready to get soaking web
So soft, so warm
And most of all, so wet
Come on baby, let's take a dip

Let's take a dip my baby
Just you and me my lady
Can we get soaking wet tonight

Time's a running out on love tonight
Cause it's all about taking something
Lets have it all, take me to your place
And kick it to me slow so slow

Let's take a dip my baby
Just you and me my lady
Can we get soaking wet tonight

I been thinking about all
The things I been known to get to baby
You've got that way
And out of all the things, out of all the things
If you'da let me take a dip baby

Let's take a dip my baby
Just you and me my lady
Can we get soaking wet tonight

Baby baby lets find a place
That's nice and wet
A place where we can get a little crazy
If the temperatures right tonight
Slip down with me baby and squeeze real tight
Now that you're with me
So I say to you

Let's take a dip my baby
Just you and me my lady
Can we get soaking wet tonight
