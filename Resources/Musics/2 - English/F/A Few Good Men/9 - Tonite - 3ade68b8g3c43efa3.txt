TONITE

You know I really wanna love you honey

I wanna show you lovin
You know I really wanna love you honey
Can I get to know it baby

And I know you feel it to
Thinkin about you
Can I see you alone

And girl it's so good

So howsa possibility
Of you getting intimate with me
Baby

And howsa possibility
Of love getting into you and me

Don't wanna stop this feeling
But it makes me want you more
To be with you
Is my only satisfaction
So maybe this time baby
Relax and give your mind

And howsa possibility
Of love getting into you and me
