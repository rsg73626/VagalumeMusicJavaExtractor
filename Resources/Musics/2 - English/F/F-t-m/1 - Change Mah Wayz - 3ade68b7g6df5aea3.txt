( verse 1 )
I sittin' alone in the dark feelin' hopeless
Now i slowly sleepin' into the darkness
I fighting 4 mah life it's my only ability
Lord doezn't help me becuz i'm guilty
Livin' az a sinner, god bless me....
Should i get on mah kneez
Band my handz and start to pray?
I don't think so cuz god can't help me anyway
Will i get the chance to live and see the next day
What should i do i'm just saying what i feel
Now they keep on attackin' me without no reason...
I couldn't juzt stand there and take shit and stare
I did selfdefence, lord are you there?
My lord, i know that you ignoring me
I ain't complety blind i can see, plez god....
Give me some diresctionz once again
I think mah fall iz the devilz plan
I have never ever hurt an innocent man
Even if i can i'm not doin' it
My whole life have been basiced in one big game
All i ever felt was pressure and pain


( f-t-m )
Lord show me the way
Help me change mah wayz
Before the judgement day

( f-t-m )
Lord show me the way
Help me change mah wayz

( verse 2 )
I close my eyez picture back in the old dayz
In thoze memboriez i want forever stay
Tell the whole world i'm guility to be in agez
Ey there.. i can never be the greatest
Lord take me to another peaceful place
Before itz 2-late..here i juzt see the black devilz face
Full of hate i walked the right way
The way to heavenz stair
I missed one step and failed
The lord doezn't care
My whole life basiced on sinz what can you do thoze dayz?
We killing eath other all fallin' into the hell'z cavez
We all becoming the victimz of the devilz slavez
I livin' in my own living hell the one called earth
I felt nuthin' but pain ever since mah own birth
One day mah blood gone run the streetz in a race
I shouldn't get born in the firzt place
In worze wayz some timez i wonder
If i'm god'z son or satan'z creation
I know itz soundz crazy
But the only reason i live iz for mah baby
I'm fallin' to the floor begin' the lord
To let me into heavenz door
Can't take it anymore if i live to morning
And see the sun plz forgive me for mah sinz
For there i come...
