Lovers divided
Get co-incided.
Something for everyone--

A comedy tonight!

[pseudolus]
Father and mother
Get one another.

[domina]
Something for everyone--

[senex]
A tragedy tonight!

[miles]
I get the twins, they get the best.

[erronius]
I get a family.

[hysterium]
I get a rest.

[soldiers]
We get a few girls.

[lycus]
I get some new girls.

[pseudolus]
I get the thing i want to be:
Free!

[all]
Free! free! free! free! free!
Nothing for kings, nothing for crowns.
Bring on the lovers, liars and clowns!
What is the moral?
Must be a moral.
Here is the moral, wrong or right:

Morals tomorrow!

[all]
Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy,
Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy tonight!
