LOVELY (REPRISE)

[pseudolus]
You're lovely,
Absolutely lovely.
Who'd believe the loveliness of you?
Perfect,
Sweet and warm and winsome,
Radiant as in some
Dream come true.
Now venus would seem tame,
Helen and her thou-
Sand ships would have to die of shame.
You're so lovely,
Frighteningly lovely,
That the world will never seem the same.
