IMPOSSIBLE

[SENEX]
Why did he look at her that way?

[HERO]
Why did he look at her that way?

[SENEX & HERO]
Must be my imagination.

[SENEX]
She's a lovely blooming flower, he's just a sprout--
Impossible!

[HERO]
She's a lovely blooming flower, he's all worn out--
Impossible!

[SENEX]
Just a fledgeling in the nest...

[HERO]
Just a man who needs a rest...

[SENEX]
He's a beamish boy at best.

[HERO]
Poor old fellow!

[SENEX]
He's a child, and love's a test he's too young to pass--
Impassible!

[HERO]
He has asthma, gout, a wife, lumbago and gas--
Irascible!

[SENEX]
Romping in the nursery...

[HERO]
He looks tired...

[SENEX]
Son, sit on your father's knee.

[HERO]
Father, you can lean on me.

[SENEX & HERO]
Him? I'm- Possible!

[HERO]
But why did she wave at him that way?

[SENEX]
Why did she wave at him that way?

[SENEX & HERO]
Could there be an explanation?

[HERO]
Women often want a father, she may want mine--
It's possible!

[SENEX]
He's a handsome lad of twenty,
I'm...thirty-nine--
It's possible!

[HERO]
Older men know so much more...

[SENEX]
In a way, I'm forty-four...

[HERO]
Next to him, I'd seem a bore.

[SENEX]
All right, fifty!

[HERO]
Then again, he is my father;
I ought to trust--
Impossible!

[SENEX]
Then again, with love at my age, 
sometimes it's just 
Impossible!

[HERO]
With a girl I'm ill at ease...

[SENEX]
I don't feel well...

[HERO]
Sir, about those birds and bees--

[SENEX]
Son, a glass of water, please.

[SENEX & HERO]
The situation's fraught,
Fraughter than I thought,
With horrible, impossible, possibilities!
