LOVE, I HEAR

[HERO]
Now that we're alone, may I tell you:
I've been feeling very strange.
Either something's in the air, or else a change
Is happening in me.

I think I know the cause--
I'm sure I know the cause--
From everything I've heard, there's only one cause it can be.

Love, I hear, makes you sigh a lot,
Also, love, I hear, makes you weak.
Love, I hear, makes you blush and turns you ashen,
You try to speak with passion
And squeak, I hear.

Love, they say,
Makes you pine away,
But you pine away with an idiotic grin.
I pine, I blush, I squeak, I squawk,
Today I woke too weak to walk.
What's love, I hear, I feel, I fear I'm in.
Ahh...

See what I mean?
Da da da da da da dum...
I hum a lot too.
I'm dazed I'm pale, I'm sick, I'm sore,
I've never felt so well before!
What's love, I hear, I feel, I fear,
I know I am-- I'm sure--I mean-- I hope--I trust--
I pray I must
Be in!

Forgive me if I shout,
Forgive me if I crow.
I've only just found out,
And--well,
I thought you ought to know.
