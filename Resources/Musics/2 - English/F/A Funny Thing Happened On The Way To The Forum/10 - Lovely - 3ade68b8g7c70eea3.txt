LOVELY

[PHILIA]
I'm lovely,
All I am is lovely.
Lovely is the one thing I can do.

Winsome,
What I am is winsome,
Radiant as in some
Dream come true.

Oh, Isn't it a shame?
I can neither sew
Nor cook nor read or write my name.
But I'm happy
Merely being lovely,
For it's one thing I can give to you.

[HERO]
You're lovely,
Absolutely lovely.
Who'd believe the loveliness of you?

Winsome,
Sweet and warm and winsome,
Radiant as in some
Dream come true.
Now Venus would seem tame,
Helen and her thou --
Sand ships would have to die of shame.

[HERO & PHILIA]
And I'm happy,
Happy that you're/I'm lovely,
For there's one thing loveliness can do
It's a gift for me to share with you!
