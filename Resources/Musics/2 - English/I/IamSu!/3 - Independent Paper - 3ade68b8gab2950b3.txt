INDEPENDENT PAPER

(Hook)
We the heartbreakers, aye
We the heartbreakers, aye
On tour with the tailors
Gettin' independent paper
We the heartbreakers, breakers
We the heartbreakers, breakers
On tour with the tailors
Throwin' up the game like a banger
We the heartbreakers, aye
We the heartbreakers, aye
We the heartbreakers, aye aye aye aye

(Verse)
All I know is spread love, smoke weed
All I know is motivate my young G's
Skip the bullshit, that's what I don't need
Haters fall down from a nosebleed
I be swagged-up, nigga swagged-out
Bitch, I'm the president, I'm fin' to get a white house
Lame nigga, you a kid on time-out
I got a runner round the block every time out
Lil nigga, you can get too, get yo team straight
You can use the gang as a template
I be mixin' break with the heartbreak
I don't need a chase, drink a lick straight
The only way, hey

(Hook)
We the heartbreakers, breakers
We the heartbreakers, breakers
On tour with the tailors, uh
Gettin' independent paper, uuh
We the heartbreakers, uh
On tour with the tailors, aye
All this independent paper, aye

(Verse)
People think I'm on the major
And we some gangchangers
Her pardon ain't no doughs, Jeep Mangler
Party's rung on me, now a nigga famous
It's dangerous, but you don't see me complainin'
My game thick, neva lane switch
I don't got no breaker wound, always on some new shit
Neva what you think I'm on
Diamond in my teeth and I got my Cuban
Started out the bedroom now we got a movement
We gon' change the whole game
All my niggas on, boi, so plain
Run my name always in a nigga mouth
We up in the bed and make you move out
When you want a radio, I tune out
So deep, make the gamers zoom out
All these damn dummies they pursue amount
Every single shark bring a grill out
Yay, nigga

(Hook)
We the heartbreakers, breakers
We the heartbreakers, breakers
On tour with the tailors, aye
Gettin' independent paper, uuh

We the heartbreakers, breakers, uh
We the heartbreakers, breakers
On tour with the tailors
On tour with the tailors, uuh

We the heartbreakers, breakers
We the heartbreakers, breakers
On tour with the tailors, uh
Gettin' independent paper, nigga
