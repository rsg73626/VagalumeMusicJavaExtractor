IF U WANT

All the chickenheads, be quiet
Not a sound, not a sound
Shaking fast, start riots
Set it off, set it off in this bitch girl
I'll put you in a plane if you want
I'll put you in a game if you want
All you gotta do is tell me what you need
And I proceed to do everything you don't

Big dog, chop in the same spot
Everytime I wanna stop, they say keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop
Big bank, Sudi Mane make a big withdraw
Full speed, can't stop, I mean that
Pockets on Fat Joe, lean back
Brand new Benz, oh, seat back
Word around town I got the streets back
Back, back like my spine
I was just like you once upon a time
Forgiato when I ride
All up in my business like a suit and tie
She hit the red light like a real Roxanne
Ten minutes later, texting me the address
[?] with the front and the back end
All she want is a young, rich, black man

All the chickenheads, be quiet
Not a sound, not a sound
Shaking fast, start riots
Set it off, set it off in this bitch girl
I'll put you in a plane if you want
I'll put you in a game if you want
All you gotta do is tell me what you need
And I proceed to do everything you don't

All the chickenheads, be quiet
Not a sound, not a sound
Shaking fast, start riots
Set it off, set it off in this bitch girl
I'll put you in a plane if you want
I'll put you in a game if you want
All you gotta do is tell me what you need
And I proceed to do everything you don't
