YOUNG BOY

Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Can you dig it

I just wanna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side cause he watching me

Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
No stock on the semi

Tryna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side cause he watching me

And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same

Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
