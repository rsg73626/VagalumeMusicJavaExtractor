ALL I HAVE LEFT

Is this how it's going to be
These expectations laid in front of me
Holds me down, then sets me free
Is this how it's going to start
With this emptiness inside my heart
Over time pulls me apart

Don't break this thread
It's all I have of you
Don't break this thread
It's all that I hold onto

This is what's in my head
This is how I feel about you
This is what's in my head
And this is what I do

Is this how it's going to end
With so many letters left to send
It's not enough just to pretend
Is this all I have left
I'll never forget you
I sat with you as we looked out on the water
And I knew it was right

Don't break this thread
It's all I have of you
By this string I've been led
It's all that I hold onto

This is what's in my head
This is how I feel about you
This is what's in my head
And this is what I do

-

I still remember that morning when the sunlight hit your eyes
I made you feel guilty, but I never made you cry
I know you don't believe me when I tell you the truth
And I know you look right through me when I'm looking through to you
I'm never going to realize, I'm never going to understand
I'm always going to be a boy, I'm never going to be a man
I held you in my arms, and I swore I'd never leave
