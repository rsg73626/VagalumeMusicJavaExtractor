IT TAKES THREE (MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY)

My whole life, I've watched you
You're everywhere on my TV
And I dream, about you
While I read your magazine

You told me that beauty is on the inside
I'm sure it's beautiful inside of you
Remember when you taught me how to count to five?
As far as I could see, there were only two

Mary-Kate and Ashley
Mary-Kate and Ashley
Mary-Kate and Ashley
And I'll never think of anyone but you
Unless your sister wanted to

Every 1 Saturday
Your faces fly across the screen
I wish I, could tell you
Just how much you mean to me

You told me that beauty is on the inside
I'm sure it's beautiful inside of you
Remember when you taught me how to count to five?
As far as I could see, there were only two

Mary-Kate and Ashley
Mary-Kate and Ashley
Mary-Kate and Ashley
And I'll never think of anyone but you
Unless your sister wanted to

You told me that beauty is on the inside
I'm sure it's beautiful inside of you
Remember when you taught me how to count to five?
As far as I could see, there were only two

Every night on my TV screen
