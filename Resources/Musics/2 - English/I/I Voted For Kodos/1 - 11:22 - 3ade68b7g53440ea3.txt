This candle, this flame
I'll sit and watch it burn, slowly
It burns away the memories of the pain I've felt
So soon, so far away

Don't try to hold it for a day
It just makes things worse, I've learned
If you try, you'll try to hold it close to you
The more it slips away

I feel numb from the neck down
My arms hang useless, my feet drag on
I'm staring straight
I'm staring straight ahead
Inside of me, I'll hold it down
I know I can kill this with time
Don't fight, don't fight it
It makes it all worthwhile

When I stare into the sun
I just can't look away
Thought it starts out warm
I've learned it can burn me
It seems I'll never learn

Don't try to hold it for a day
It just makes things worse, I've learned
If you try, you'll try to hold it close to you
The more it slips away
Don't try to hold her for a day
You'll just make it hurt, I've learned
Though you'll try, you'll never hold her close enough to you
The more she slips away

This candle, this flame
I'll sit and watch it burn, slowly
It burns away the memories of the pain I've felt
So soon, so far away

Don't try to hold it for a day
It just makes things worse, I've learned
Oh I've tried, I tried to hold her close to me
And now she's slipped away
