SUGAR HIGH

They all say she's just another groupie slut 
(she's just a hoe, she's just a hoe)
Said I thought you anything but, think again
Sometimes reputations, out live their applications
Some times fires don't go out, when you're done playing with them
Feels so funny deep inside
When you kiss me goodbye
Sugar High
We'll go out, not even leave the house
TV set and a bottle of wine's just fine
Making out on my old pull out couch
Watching Saturday Night Live
Feels so funny deep inside
When I lick between your thighs
Sugar High
I have searched both far and wide
I've explored the deepest caverns of my mind
Trying to find explanations why
I get this funny feeling deep inside
When you kiss me goodbye
And I like between your thighs
Sugar High
