WISH I WAS AARON

Well here we are now, we're playing a show
Seems like we've got such a long way to go
'cause we want to be big stars, don't you know
19 seems so old, 
when I see a little girl that I want to hold
she's so young, but that's alright
'cause I still might take her home with me tonight
and all the kids are jumping up and down
been so long since I've seen a rude boy in this town
'cause he traded in his strips for a Hawaiian shirt
he's got his new Doc Martin's to kick the dirt, well
I'm not old school (but I still wear my chucks)
Probably always will ('cause our band really sucks)
Want to make it big (is that so bad?)
Want to be Reel Big Fish

Wish I was Aaron, I'd take the stage
All the little girl's would be amazed
And the kids would listen to every word I say 
Wish I was Aaron (and I wish I was Scott)

Well Reel Big Fish you know they've got it made
Because they signed with the record company,
they're going to get paid
Well they mess up all the lyrics and they've got no style
I say they're going to get it right but it might take a while
So, don't touch that dial (I'm talking behind your back)
Well I love the band, they're a great bunch of guys
But looking at her brings tears to my eyes
Said I'm watching her shake,
she's going to give me a heart attack now, baby

Wish I was Aaron, I'd take the stage
All the little girl's would be amazed
And the kids would listen to every word I say 
Wish I was Aaron (and I wish I was Scott)

Promise I'll still sing
When we get Reel big
Won't forget our fans
When we're your favorite band
And I'd do anything that you want me to
Just give me all you're money, I'll sing for you
We'd sell out any day
It's the American way (It was like that when I got here)

Wish I was Aaron, I'd take the stage
All the little girl's would be amazed
And the kids would listen to every word I say 
Wish I was Aaron ( and I wish I was Scott)

I wish I was Aaron, he's wishes he was Scott
You know we wouldn't drink, and we wouldn't smoke pot
We'd just play our hearts out every single night
