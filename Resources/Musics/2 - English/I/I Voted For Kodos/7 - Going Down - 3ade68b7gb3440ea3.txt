GOING DOWN

They always told me you shouldn't play with gasoline
all it takes is just one spark and you'll start a fire
but I said fuck it and I doused myself and lit a match and
now Iâ€™m burning up, now Iâ€™m going down and....

I feel it, itâ€™s coming, itâ€™s draping over me
Blocking out all of the light, touching everything that I see
I used to dream about you, now I canâ€™t dream without you
But I find that day by day, it goes away

On the second day, God divided the light
One to rule the day, and one to rule the night
And when I look at her, I see her shining down, I think out loud
Now Iâ€™m going down, now Iâ€™m going down and....

Itâ€™s not the path that I choose, itâ€™s just my destiny
If youâ€™d bring it back to me, if youâ€™d listen to what I say, girl
Wreak everything he gave you,
shun from the light that saves you
Still I find that day by day, it goes away

Every time, every time Iâ€™m walking home
Every single time, I walk alone
See her standing, see her sitting, see her laying, see her go
Now Iâ€™m moving on, now Iâ€™m going down and....

I draw the shadows around me, I push the sun light away
And it affects the way I feel, and thatâ€™s the way I feel today
I used to dream about you, girl I canâ€™t dream with out you now
