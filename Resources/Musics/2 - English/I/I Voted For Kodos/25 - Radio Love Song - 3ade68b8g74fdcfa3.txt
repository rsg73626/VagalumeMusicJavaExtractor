RADIO LOVE SONG

There's this girl that I met at school
Not the one I go to but the one that's cool
With most girls I have no fear
But she looks just like Britney Spears
If I had her number I could call her up
Tried to write a song but my band still sucks
Guess my only shot is to call the station
I hope she owns a radio

Just one kiss, is my request
Send it off to you, with the weekly hits
A long distance dedication
My heart to yours, straight to number one

Couldn't find Kasem so we're calling up Daly
There's no doubt that some day he's going to play me
Our on-line totals hit 53
standing right next to NFG
Still this girl that I can't stop thinking
She's SE so I better stop drinking
She thinks we've sold out
I wonder if she's seen my video

Just one kiss, is my request
Send it off to you, with the weekly hits
A long distance dedication
My heart to yours, straight to number one
