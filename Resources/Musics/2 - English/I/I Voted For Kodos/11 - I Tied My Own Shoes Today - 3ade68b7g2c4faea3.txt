I TIED MY OWN SHOES TODAY

I tied my own shoes today
I tied my own shoes today
Because we're not famous,
and I can't afford to pay somebody else

I tied my own shoes today
I tied my own shoes today
No one votes for our video
and we'll never meet Carson Daly

but if we did,
I promise we would not change at all
except Paul could afford better lawyers
and I could pay some one
to tie my shoes
'cause I tie my own shoes

I tied my own shoes today
I tied my own shoes today
Because we're not famous,
and I can't afford to pay somebody else

I tied my own shoes today
I tied my own shoes today
and Nick can't afford medicine for his syphilis
and we're still not famous

and no one comes to our shows
'cause we don't live in southern California
and everyone hates us
'cause we play ska
and ska really sucks

I tied my own shoes today
with some help from Lee
