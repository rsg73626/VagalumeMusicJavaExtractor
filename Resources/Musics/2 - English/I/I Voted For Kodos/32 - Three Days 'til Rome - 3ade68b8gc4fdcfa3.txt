THREE DAYS 'TIL ROME

She's been looking over at me all day
tried to think of something to say
But I just can't make it right
And she's been following me everywhere
I can see the sunlight shining in her hair
Long after darkness has fallen

She was waiting by the door when I showed up at three AM
She said - I waited for you.

We'll make it home tonight, she'll make it right
Three days 'til Rome we'll make it home
Three days 'til Rome we'll make it home

Sorry if I seem a little tired from
All the time that we spent in the van
But I never learned how to say "no"
Lee told me to let it go
And save the story until we're back out on the road

She was sleeping on the bed when I showed up at three AM
She said - I waited for you.

We'll make it home tonight, she'll make it right
Three days 'til Rome we'll make it home
Three days 'til Rome we'll make it.

I found a note sitting by the phone when I showed up at three AM
It said - I waited for you.
