YOU'RE MY FAVORITE

Every time I see you, my thoughts turn to that night
When I held your hand in mine, and I looked into your eyes
And everything just felt right
Do you think about me the way I think about you
These are all the things I wonder when I can't sleep in my room
And if I could just close my eyes, I know I'd see you soon

Will you still be here, when the summer finds its end
If I talk to you in August will we still pretend that we're just friends
That we're just friends

I still remember the first time I made you laugh
The way you looked at me and everything it was
Got into my car and drove for hours just to see you
Just because

Will you still be here, when the summer finds its end
If I talk to you in August will we still pretend that we're just friends
That we're just friends

My heart won't learn
My heart won't learn

She wrote me a letter and she sent me her picture
Now I miss her
Would you notice if these words were about you
If I told you the meaning, would you still have no feeling?

Will you still be here, when the summer finds its end
If I talk to you in August will we still pretend that we're just friends
That we're just friends.
