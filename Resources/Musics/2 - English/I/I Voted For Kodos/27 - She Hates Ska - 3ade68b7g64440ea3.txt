SHE HATES SKA

Hanging around before we played when I saw her across the room
Yeah well, she's mighty cute, so I thought I might make my move
I saddled up beside her, to see what she's about
I introduced myself, but then, I found out that

She hates ska, she won't dance
Guess that I don't have a chance
When we play she won't stay (Oi Oi Oi)
She hates ska, she won't go
Out with me after the show
by the second song she's gone far away (oh yeah)

she said annoying horn riffs, after beats are so lame
she said the horns are so boring,
all the songs sound the same
she said she wishes Aaron would die,
and flipsyde and the specials too
when I heard that I almost cried, yeah, I felt so blue 'cause

She hates ska, she won't dance
Guess that I don't have a chance
When we play she won't stay (Oi Oi Oi)
She hates ska, she won't go
Out with me after the show
by the second song she's gone far away (oh yeah)

If I ever, asked her to skank
She'd probably think I called her one
Just 'cause I play, in a ska band
doesn't mean that I'm no fun (LET'S GO!)

now she's all over the guy from the metal band
hey jealousy, I've had about all I can stand
there's just one thing that I don't understand
why the hell was she wearing Vans if...

She hates ska, she won't dance
Guess that I don't have a chance
When we play she won't stay (Oi Oi Oi)
She hates ska, she won't go
Out with me after the show
by the second song she's gone far away (oh yeah)
She hates ska, and I saw her
Making out in the back
Of the metal head's car (Oi Oi Oi0
She hates ska, She hates ska
