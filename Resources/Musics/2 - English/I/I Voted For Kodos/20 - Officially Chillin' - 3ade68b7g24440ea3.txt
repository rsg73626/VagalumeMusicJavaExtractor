OFFICIALLY CHILLIN'

Sometimes I find, cuando [some Mexican crap]
My mind unwinds, takes me away to a different kind of place
Feels like I'm floating through space and I feel the sun in my face
And it's all right

And I'm Chillin'
Officially Chillin'
Unwilling
To do much, in particular

When I reach south beach, I see oh baby (hey baby)
Buxom blond beauties in bikinis everywhere, oh yeah
Then I'm looking, finding, running in the water flailing
And I stop, in the Hammock

And I'm Chillin'
Officially Chillin'
Unwilling
To do much, in particular

When I reach north beach, I can do or have whatever I want
Esta bien when the pyramid comes crashing down again
Dive and you catch the Frisbee (hey nice one man)
Hey, who's Bikini top is this anyway (dude, check that out)
Whoa, never mind

And I'm Chillin'
Officially Chillin'
Unwilling
To do much, in particular

Maybe I'll layout in the sun
Smiley face on my stomach, that'd be fun
