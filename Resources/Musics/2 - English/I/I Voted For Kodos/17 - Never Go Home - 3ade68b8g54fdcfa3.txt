NEVER GO HOME

So did anybody tell you?
It looks like we got let down
and I don't know if you even care
but I just thought you might cause you were there
You know what I say about it
I know you say that I say too much
but don't try to tell me I was wrong
when I told you that you're going to look back
you'll look back

I won't think about it this time
we'll get by 'cause we'll never go home and
I won't think about it this time
we'll get by, we'll get by

now you're turning on the radio
turn it up, and we'll sing real loud
do you remember that song that we used to play
we wrote about this town, it seems like it was yesterday
you know what I think about her
I know you think that I think too much
I can't believe that a week from now
you'll close your eyes and you'll feel just fine
just fine

I won't think about it this time
we'll get by 'cause we'll never go home and
I won't think about it this time
we'll get by, we'll get by

On that night when we were driving home
In Colorado, I could hear you breath
Tempers flared and tempers flaring
I never wanted anything so bad

We'll get by, we'll get by
