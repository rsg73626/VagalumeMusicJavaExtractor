PASTARONI

Six o'clock, I'm hungry and alone
So I call you on the phone
'cause I know that you'll be home
I made enough for two
Yeah, I made enough for you.
Still I wonder why

Why I'd want to share my Pastaroni
With anyone I don't know
But especially why......
Why I'd want to share my Pastaroni
With anyone I don't know
But especially why......why with you.

Three hours later, I'm still hungry 
and I'm still alone
'cause I sent you home
wanting
I shouldn't have used you
But she used me, and as usually
My spite has made me

Why I'd want to share my Pastaroni
With anyone I don't know
But especially why......
Why I'd want to share my Pastaroni
With anyone I don't know
But especially why......why with you

Tripping, trying, to get to you
