SHERRIE'S SONG

Do you really want to go outside
It's so cold out there
Wouldn't you rather spend the night
I'll keep you warm
In here

Laying next to you
Your skin on my skin
Wouldn't you rather pretend
That this night doesn't have to end
And I
I'll take you home in the morning
I promise, I swear
In the morning
I'll take you home

And maybe you'll stay
And maybe you will stay
And maybe you'll stay with me

To wake up next to you
And watch you sleeping
Is all I want right now
Is all I want right now
And I know I can't keep you
And this night has to end
But if we just hold on to tonight
If we just never fall asleep
Maybe this won't end
Maybe this won't end
Maybe this night won't end

If we hold on to tonight
Then maybe this won't end
If we never fall asleep
Then maybe this won't end
Then maybe this won't end
Then maybe this won't end
Then maybe this night won't end
