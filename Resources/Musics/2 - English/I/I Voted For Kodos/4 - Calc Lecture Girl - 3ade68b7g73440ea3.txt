CALC LECTURE GIRL

There's 400 people in my calc lecture
there's only one that I think about
I don't give a damn for the others
but there's one girl  who makes me wanna twist and shout
 
One day she sat next to me
nowhere could I see a girl as fair as she
Maybe one day she'll sit by me again
Maybe I could even start a conversation

I don't even know her name but I think I love her all the same
The girl in my calc lecture

The girl in my calc lecture 
there's no u-substitution for her
I guess for now I'll wait and see
If I can integrate her and me

I don't care about Rolle's Theorem
or the Half-Angle Formulas, who needs them?
I wish the prof would give it a rest,
I'm just staring at the sine curve of the girl's brea...

I don't even know her name but I think I love her all the same 
The girl in my calc lecture
 
Maybe if I got the courage 
To talk to her
Maybe she could help me out with
My math homework
I could ask her out at gunpoint
but she'd probly think I'm a jerk...let's go!

I don't even know her name but I think I love her all the same 
The girl in my calc lecture
I don't even know her name but I think I love her all the same 
The girl in my calc lecture
