BROKEN WING

Well there once was a bird named Sammy
Who had a yellow head
You might say this bird is crazy
Why can't he fly straight ahead?
Well, he never seems to know
Exactly where he will go
Is he smashed or smoking hash?
I don't know, but he sure crashed
How can he be flying
When his right and left wings
Aren't compromising
Not deciding where to go
Is his head in the gutter?
Both wings are the same
A bunch of light weight feathers 
With a hollow bone as a frame
Well they're easily replaced
Sammy sheds but he hasn't changed
He's not making much progress
The snail's having more success
How can he be flying
When his right and left wings
Aren't compromising
Not deciding where to go
Why, does he, try to fly?
Why don't he just die?
How can he be flying
When his right and left wings
Aren't compromising
