XENA

Xena Xena you're the best
I would like to palm your breast
Shove your ass onto the floor
Make you holler, scream for more
Maybe when we're done with the set
All night long I'll keep you wet
Xena Xena, you're so great
I think about you when I masturbate

Ba ba ba ba ba

Me so H-O-R-N-Y
When I'm looking at your thighs
Your B-R-E-A-S-Ts
Really make me so happy
M-A-D-F-U-C-K
All night long, everyday
D-O-G-G-Y-S-T-Y-L-E
Come on Xena, get down on your knees

Ba ba ba ba ba

Now they've gone and put me in jail
Just because I read your mail
Staking out in your back yard
Looking at you undress makes me hard
Gabriel is nice and fine
But you're the one who's on my mind
