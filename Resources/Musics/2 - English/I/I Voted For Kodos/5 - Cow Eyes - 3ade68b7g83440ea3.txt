COW EYES

I'm giving up on you 
'cause of all the thing you do
you wear your hair up in a spike
always do things that I don't like
like the time you slashed my tires
then you lit my clothes on fire
I really don't mean to whine
but I was wearing them at the time

I'm giving up on you 
'cause you never come through
like the time that your aunt
needed a kidney transplant
you were supposed to be there at five 
but you just had to see Weezer live
hope you really liked Butterfly
'cause during that song, poor Edina died
Whoa, live like the world was meant for you 
Whoa, act like I was too
Whoa, seems like it's never good enough for you
Whoa, Whoa yeah!
Well I can't say that I'm sorry, 'cause that would be like a lie
And I can't say that I like you, 'cause I don't, but I sure as hell try
But I can say you're forgiven, even though you did nothing wrong
Now it's time to pick it up (pick it up), and move along with this song
Whoa, live like the world was meant for you 
Whoa, act like I was too
Whoa, seems like it's never good enough for you
Whoa, Whoa yeah!

I'm giving up on you
'cause you won't stop sniffing glue
you know that stuff messes up your brain
I really think that you're going insane
'cause you told me that you're going to 
sell your car and buy a gun
move on out to Hollywood
hook up with a Wayens bro
crash the Jerry Springer show
stop the big conspiracy
and save the world from Kathy Lee
Whoa, live like the world was meant for you 
Whoa, act like I was too
Whoa, though I try it's never good enough for you
Whoa, Whoa yeah!
