PERFECTING THE ART OF PERSUASION

Picked up the paper today, just like any other day
But today I got more news than I was expecting
And Blondie wasn't as funny today, 'cause it said that you had gone away
On the hand written note that was scrawled from Peanuts to Ziggy

I don't want to fix your heart, when everything falls apart on you
And I don't want to be the one who you come crawling back to

What did he say, what did he say that changed your mind?
What did he say, what did he say that changed your.

So I sit by myself perfecting the art of persuasion
And all my plants and my dog have agreed to follow me
Now I could try to convince you, or I could try to convince myself
That everything happens for a reason

But I don't want to play that part, 'cause I'll just end up like you
And I don't want to be the one who you come crawling back to

What did he say, what did he say that changed your mind?
What did he say, what did he say that changed your.
