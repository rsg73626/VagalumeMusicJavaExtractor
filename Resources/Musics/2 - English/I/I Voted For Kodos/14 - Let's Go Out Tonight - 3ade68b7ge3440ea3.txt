LET'S GO OUT TONIGHT

Hey yeah it's Saturday evening
I don't have to worry about anything
Got nothing on my mind
Except havin a good time
123 come on throw me the frisbee
145 feels good to be alive whoa-oh

oh yeah oh yeah alright alright come on let's go out tonight
oh yeah oh yeah alright alright let's go out tonight

Something's comin on that I can't prevent
Like the bubbles in my beverage so effervescent
Like when I crank the car stereo
Sing along Hey Ho Let's Go whoa-oh
123 hit me with a melody
145 feels good to be alive whoa-oh

oh yeah oh yeah alright alright come on let's go out tonight
oh yeah oh yeah alright alright let's go out tonight

Like when that pretty girl's dancing all alone
Your eyes meet as you approach
She smiles at you and holds you close
Yeah it's really the most whoa-oh
123 Come on baby dance with me
145 Feels good to be alive

oh yeah oh yeah alright alright come on let's go out tonight
oh yeah oh yeah alright alright let's go out tonight

pick it up now keep it goin pick it up the juices flowin all night thru
i don't care where we're goin it's just fine not knowin as long as it's with you

oh yeah oh yeah alright alright come on let's go out tonight
oh yeah oh yeah alright alright come on let's go out tonight
oh yeah oh yeah alright alright let's go out tonight
