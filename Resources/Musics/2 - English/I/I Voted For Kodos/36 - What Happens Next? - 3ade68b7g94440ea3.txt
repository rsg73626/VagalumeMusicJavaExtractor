WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Come on, say something please
What do you want me down on my knees
I don't know what to do
To make this all up to you
And the situation's really got me down
It gets worse when ever you're around

I know I've been bad
But are you really still mad?
What happens when sorry's not good enough
What happens next
This guilt sucks
Come on now, I've had enough
I want things the way it had been

I know I'll mess up again
After all I'm only human 
What will you do
The day you mess up too
They say that time heals all wounds
I guess that's all that I'm hanging on to

I know I've been bad
But are you really still mad?
What happens when sorry's not good enough
What happens next
This guilt sucks
Come on now, I've had enough
I want things the way it had been
But are you really still mad?
They say that time heals all wounds
