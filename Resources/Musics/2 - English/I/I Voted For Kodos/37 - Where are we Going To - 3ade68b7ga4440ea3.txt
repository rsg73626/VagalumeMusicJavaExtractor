WHERE ARE WE GOING TO

You're asking me about myself
You're looking in my eyes
You're lauging at the stories I tell
You say you sympathize

Back at my place we lay on the couch
You like Sunday mornings, too
Wondering if it's gonna all work out
Wondering if you're something new

And you said you like to watch the stars
Early in the morning
Just as the sky is turning blue
And I said if Jupiter and Mars
Saw us lying here
They'd wonder just where we're going to

Where are we going to?

You shudder when you sleep at night
You touch me and you cry
When I ask you if you feel alright
You say it's something deep inside

Is this just another summer fling?
Are you messing with my head?
I know when a girl says anything
You never know just what she's said

And you said you like to watch the stars
Early in the morning
Just as the sky is turning blue
And I said if Jupiter and Mars
Saw us lying here
They'd wonder just where we're going to

Where are we going to?
