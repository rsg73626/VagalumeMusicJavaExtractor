YOU NEVER ASKED ME TO

You could never think, of just what to say
You never asked me to, now I've gone away
I wanted to tell, what I felt for you
But when the time came round, you never asked me to

Now look what's happened to you
Fourteen is my lucky number
Why did you make me choose?
Fourteen is my lucky number

I would have been with you, not the other way
You never asked me to, so I didn't stay
Remember all the times, that I spent with you
Though I was leaning in, you never asked me to

Now look what's happened to you
Fourteen is my lucky number
Why did you make me choose?
Fourteen is my lucky number

Remember all the times, that you drove me home
You never asked me to, so I slept alone
The opportunities, that you let slip through
I never said a word, you never asked me to

Now look what's happened to you
Fourteen is my lucky number
Why did you make me choose?
