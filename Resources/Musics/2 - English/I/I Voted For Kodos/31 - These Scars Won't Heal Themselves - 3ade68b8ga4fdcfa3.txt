THESE SCARS WON'T HEAL THEMSELVES

Bright eyes, maybe you ought to take this down
Or keep doing all the things that make you happy
While I'm bleeding on the ground
Like the sky that night (the sky that night)
Seen from the lake was turning red
Like the blood that's running from my head
I should have run away, I should have just run away

This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
No one bleeds as much as I do
Cut myself to feel just like you
This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
Wrap this cloth around my face 'cause
These scars won't heal themselves

What would you do if I cut you?
I want you to feel something that feels like I do
You'd probably just stand there
Stand there and stare at me with your blue eyes, and
Now I know just what to do
I'll draw a line through me and you
I'll draw a line through me and you, and
Hope that your hands can't find the matches

This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
No one bleeds as much as I do
Cut myself to feel just like you
This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
Wrap this cloth around my face 'cause
These scars won't heal themselves

And in the dream I had
I felt the blood with my own hands was cold
I never really meant to hurt you (I never really meant to hurt you)
I never really meant to (never meant to, ever hurt you)

This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
No one bleeds as much as I do
Cut myself to feel just like you
This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
Wrap this cloth around my face 'cause
These scars won't heal themselves

This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
This is the way you break my heart
