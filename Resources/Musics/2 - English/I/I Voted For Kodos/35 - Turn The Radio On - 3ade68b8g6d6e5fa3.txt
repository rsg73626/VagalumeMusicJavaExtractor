TURN THE RADIO ON

Telling your life story across the radio waves

Lock yourself in your room
'cause nothing's going right this year
Make sure that stereo's loud
It'll be just like I'm right here

I wont give up on this 'cause it's what makes me happy
And now you can't resist because it makes you happy

When you turn the radio on you'll hear me sing to you
No one else understands you quite the way I do
When you turn the radio on you'll repeat every word that I say
Telling your life story across the radio waves

Before you drowned out this ocean
I think that you should leave this room
Get in your car and drive to the city
Go anywhere that you hear my voice
And hope I'll be there. . .

What can I do?
I'd do anything for a girl like you
I'd do anything for a girl like you
I'll tell you lies if you tell me that you're listening

When you turn the radio on you'll hear me sing to you
No one else understands you quite the way I do
When you turn the radio on you'll repeat every word that I say
Telling your life story across the radio waves
