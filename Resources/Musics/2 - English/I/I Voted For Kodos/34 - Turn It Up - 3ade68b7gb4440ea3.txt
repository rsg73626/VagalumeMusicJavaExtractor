TURN IT UP

come on baby turn it up 1234 
come on baby turn it up 5678 
come on baby don't say maybe yeah 
when I say when turn it up again 9 10 

feel the rhythm, pulsing through my veins 
sweet music and melody takes away the pain 
it's a drug all on its own 
I don't need nothing else and I'm ready to go (GO!)

so come on baby turn it up 1234... 

Bass, Guitars, drums and amplfiers 
yeah nothing can put out this fire 
oh girl do you feel it too? 
does the rhythm and the melody move you

so come on baby turn it up 1234...

unity, you and me, sharing this moment together right now 
make it last, leaves so fast, but now the speaker's loud 
Those words, bass lines, lyrics, resonate 
yeah something that makes life worth living 

so come on baby turn it up 1234...
