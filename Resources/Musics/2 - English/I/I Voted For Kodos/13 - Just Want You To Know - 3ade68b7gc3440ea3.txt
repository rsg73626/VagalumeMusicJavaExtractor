JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

Called me up again late last night
Said you and your boyfriend had got in a fight
Saw him with another girl today
He was never good to you anyway
You know your friends always hated him so
Should have left his ass long ago
You know I'll try to make it better

I just want you to know, that's going to be alright
And I just want you to know, it's okay if you stay for the night
And I just want you to know, that I want to make love to you
And I just want you to know, girl I'm going to get with you

From the very first time we kissed 
You're talking about relationships
Well you know that I want more
But it's just never felt right before
And all those girls that I've abused
You know they walked away feeling used
But it's about time that I quit
'cause you're to good for it.

I just want you to know, that's going to be alright
And I just want you to know, it's okay if you stay for the night
And I just want you to know, that I want to make love to you
