FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS OUT

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

I don't know a damn thing about you
But I'm coming through to infect your stereo
I've been waiting here to give you a message
I've been waiting inside here to get your attention, yeah

I see you making eyes
You make them almost as poorly as I make excuses
I've got a guarantee and twenty thousand uses
A life time warranty and twenty thousand uses, yeah

Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
(That's what you said)
Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
(I've got nothing)
Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
Relax, 'cause you're turning me on

You've got me in your room
Between your printed sheets and your Tori Amos poster
It's okay 'cause I think I've done this before
It's okay honey, I've done this before, yeah

Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
(That's what you said)
Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
(I've got nothing)
Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
Relax, 'cause you're turning me on

Yeah Yeah Yeah

Relax, 'cause you're turning me on
