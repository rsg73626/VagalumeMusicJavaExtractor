GUNPOINT

Well  this crush, it hurts so bad
I really wish that I had you
When you're not around I wish I was dead
I know, I'll hold a handgun to your head
'cause it's the only way
to make sure you'll say, okay

I'm going to ask you out at gunpoint
I know it'll work
Ask you out at gunpoint
Please don't think I'm a jerk
Ask you out at gunpoint
We'll start with a gun
Ask you out at gunpoint
It will soon grow into love
Now I've got you in my sights
When your around I feel so right
I know you'll see that I'm the one
I won't take your rejection
'cause it's the only way
to make sure you'll say, okay

I'm going to ask you out at gunpoint
I know it'll work
Ask you out at gunpoint
Please don't think I'm a jerk
Ask you out at gunpoint
We'll start with a gun
Ask you out at gunpoint
It will soon grow into love
There you are and here I go
I've got plenty of a-a-a-a-ammo
I'll aim the gun
