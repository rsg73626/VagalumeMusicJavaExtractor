BURN THE BODIES TO THE GROUND

It's ten degrees inside the house tonight
I'm seeing corpses drawing on the walls
And drinking themselves to death
They're playing games and fighting late
Smoking their cigarettes and choking on the fog
Breathe in, say hello, i'm alive again in these walls
Let's drink 'till we're dead! so dramatic...
I press my face against her chest, can't feel a heartbeat
But her hands are warm; she's singing that song again:
"love misery, how much she hates..."
I'll light a match and burn the bodies to the ground
Breathe in, say hello, i'm alive again in these walls
Let's drink 'till we're dead! so dramatic, i do it so well!
Breathe in, say hello, i'm alive again in these walls
Let's drink 'till we're dead!
I'm so dramatic...
As the fire dance surrounds, all the pictures burning, longing,
Waiting, release the memories of you
As our house burns to the ground, i will breathe you in, remember
You loved me, release the real...
Let's burn this place down
Breathe in, say hello, i'm alive again in these walls
Let's drink 'till we're dead! i'm so dramatic, i do it so well!
Breathe in, say hello, i'm alive again in these walls
Let's drink 'till we're dead! i'm so dramatic... i do it well
Let's burn this place! let's burn this face!
