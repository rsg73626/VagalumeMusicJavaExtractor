CROSSING THE RIVER STYX

Requiem...
Kyrie Elesion
Gratia tua illis succurrente
Mereantur evadere judicium
Fac eas de morte transire ad vitam
Et in memoria aeterna erit
Requiem...


Lord, have mercy
By the help of Thy grace
May they be enabled to escape the judgement
Grant them to pass over from death to life
And they shall live in memory everlasting.



Tantus labor non sit cassus
Ne me perdas

Such travail must not be in vain
Do not let me be lost


Cor Contritum quasi cinis
Quem patronum rogarturus?
ne me perdas

My heart is as though ground to ashes
To which protector shall I appeal?
Do not let me be lost.
