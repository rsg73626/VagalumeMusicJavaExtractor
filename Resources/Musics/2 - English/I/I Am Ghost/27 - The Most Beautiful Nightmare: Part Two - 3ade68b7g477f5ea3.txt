THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NIGHTMARE: PART TWO

Yesterday ignites a star that is burned and dead, 
we are looking for this heartbeat laying cold upon my chest, 
as I hold you for the very last time, we will burn together, 
just say enough to show me... yea, it was the first time, and the last time
Heads Rolling, Heads Rolling, it never felt so good!
Heads Rolling, Heads Rolling, it never felt so good!
The Killer prays, lights a match with his own eyes, 
he is still looking for that heartbeat, as the coffin burns out bright, 
as i hold you as they burry us in gold for the last time, 
just say enough to show me your eyes... 
that was the last thing that she sold...
Heads Rolling, Heads Rolling, it never felt so good!
Heads Rollling, Heads Rolling, it never felt so good!
In these arms would you care enough to dance? 
I'm searching for this heartbeat, and i know it will not last, 
but would you care enough to say that i know that i am ok with you, this is the last time... so please dont make a sound.
That was the first time, and the last, 
these broken pictures of a face i can not ignore you eyes, 
yes your eyes, so blue!!!
Yesterday ignites a star that is burned and dead, 
we are looking for this heartbeat laying cold upon my chest, 
and I hold you for the very last time, we will burn together, 
just say enough to show me... with your eyes.
