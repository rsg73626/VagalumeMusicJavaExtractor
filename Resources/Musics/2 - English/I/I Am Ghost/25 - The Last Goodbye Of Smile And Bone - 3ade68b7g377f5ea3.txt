THE LAST GOODBYE OF SMILE AND BONE

Can I lay my wings up high? Ten long years of being ugly, but tonight we¹ll
learn to fly like angels. The morning comes and goes, we try, across the
valley with dreams that weigh us down. She falls, I soar too high and crash
the sun
Say goodbye (thank you for what you've given me) in the hollow we will make
it.
So divine (the lonely hearts club will never fade away). Tonight we dance.
Dear God, I wrote a letter drenched in my own blood. Upon the message it
read, "I loved, I loved"
We will unite, and I¹m thanking you for loving me.
But never, never, never again. I'm thanking you for loving me.
A first kiss and a last goodbye, ten long years with a paper cut that's cold
and dead to me. Just open up the window, and see the coffin, remember who we
were and where we go tonight, just like the movies we grow, we grow
Say goodbye (thank you for what you've given me) in the hollow we will make
it.
So divine (the lonely hearts club will never fade away). Tonight we dance.
We will unite, and I'm thanking you for loving me.
But never, never, never again. I'm thanking you for loving me.
The last goodbye of smile of bone‹why did the love fade away?
We will never be apart, we will never fall, it will never be the same. Why
did the love fade away?
As you died in my arms, we will never fall...we dance...we danced...we
danced...for
you...
We will unite, and I'm thanking you for loving me.
But never, never, never again.
I'm thanking you for loving me.
As you died in my arms, it was the last goodbye of smile and bone.
