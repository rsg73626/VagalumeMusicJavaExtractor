THIS IS HOME

Close your eyes, it's easier that way
A golden cup and a toast to kings
Lost and decayed, we are cut beyond our saving
But we are home now, the room is still warm

Fell in love with an angel, a heart that isn't cold
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on
I've blessed these shadows and tasted every one
They can't steal our love tonight

A century of open arms that shield the light
This battle scar is healing
Cast all the pain to the tourniquet that binds me
We are home now, the sun won't hurt you anymore

Fell in love with an angel, a heart that isn't cold
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on
I've blessed these shadows and tasted every one
They can't steal our love tonight

Love has given me a reason to live
And love has given me a reason to die

Fell in love with an angel, a heart that isn't cold
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on
I've blessed these shadows and tasted every one 
They can't steal our love tonight

Fell in love with an angel, 
A heart that isn't cold, isn't cold, isn't cold
I can feel the pain of the sun as it lights up the air
I can taste the hope, it's everywhere...

Love has given me a reason to live
And love has given me a reason to say goodbye
