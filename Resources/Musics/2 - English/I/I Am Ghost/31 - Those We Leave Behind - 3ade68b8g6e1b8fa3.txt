THOSE WE LEAVE BEHIND

I've suffered more in this city, where ashes fall
A living tombstone that takes your mind
In bliss tattooed voices where we all fall down...
Broke down the door to masks and stairs
Dropped in the toxic ugly air, like gasoline it stings my face
And lungs, pulled back the red sheets from her eyes
I never said my last goodbye and it rips my heart out...
I'm half the man without you so take the missing pieces from my heart!
Hold me like you did when we were younger, your eyes speak to
Me it's the truth, our haunting; the days of my surrender
I kissed you head and said goodnight, I raised the dead and said goodbye
Hid all the knives that killed the sun, cut all the wires and now I'm done
And picked apart the soul, just leave the skin and bones
This one and only where time steals you, drink up and hold me down
I'm half the man without you so take the missing pieces from my heart...
Hold me like you did when we were younger, your eyes speak to
Me it's the truth, our haunting; the days of my surrender
I kissed your head and said goodnight, I raised the
Dead and said goodbye, goodnight... goodbye!
Let go, let go of me... now!
Hold me like you did when we were younger. your eyes speak to
Me it's the truth...
Hold me like you did when we were younger. your eyes speak to
Me it's the truth. our haunting; the days of my surrender
I kissed your head and said goodnight, lets raise the dead and say
Goodbye
