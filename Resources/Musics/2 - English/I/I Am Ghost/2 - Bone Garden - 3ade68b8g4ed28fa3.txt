BONE GARDEN

I am the man they couldn't hang 
A forced-fed son of romance dressed in hooks who kissed your 
head, killed 12 dead baby 
I am an addict burning winter, a closed-door annihilator 
Motherfucker burned who was married in your bone garden 

It's feeling hot outside lately and I'm not alone 
Feels like I'm back inside your hell (how does it feel?) 
It's gonna rain, I'm gonna rain tonight, rain on your parade 
And I'm just getting started (so how does it feel... again?) 

These ugly mall-rats burning Shepard whores 
(hide and seek) banished the walls of dying jackals who sit in 
chairs, Tonight, tonight I'll drink until I drown, take all but 
seven pills then love me in your bone garden 

It's feeling hot outside lately and I'm not alone 
Feels like I'm back inside your hell (how does it feel?) 
It's gonna rain, I'm gonna rain tonight, rain on your parade 
And I'm just getting started (So how does it feel?) 

When it rains it pours, when I rain you pour delicious 
When it rains it pours, when I rain you pour delicious 
You say you love me? But you don't know me! I can't feel anything 
(This sick mud, sick mud, this sick mud covers me)

It's feeling hot outside lately and I'm not alone 
Feels like I'm back inside your hell (how does it feel?) 
It's gonna rain, I'm gonna rain tonight, rain on your parade 
And I'm just getting started (so how does it feel?) 

It's feeling hot outside lately and I'm not alone 
Feels like I'm back inside your hell (how does it feel?) 
It's gonna rain, I'm gonna rain tonight, rain on your parade 
And I'm just getting started (So how does it feel?) 

When it rain it pours, when I rain you pour delicious
