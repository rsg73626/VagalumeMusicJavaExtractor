BURIED WAY TOO SHALLOW

This place, still can't believe it.
I'll never ever talk of this photograph:
A still frame of your lips
This killer, he danced, i kiss and tell.
Followed me for seven months
And talked about our death for several years
(i can't stop him)
There's nothing more to us than fear.

We are buried way too shallow, but it's okay.
They'll find us here holding each other tight
The search party is over now,
In our last picture the two of us never really died.

Your face was so scared to breathe in,
I feel your heartbeat like a storm.
The cut across your eyes is turning gray
This last day, our last night, i whispered slowly in your ear,
"i love you more than life to disappear" (and i can't stop him).

We are buried way too shallow, but it's okay.
They'll find us here holding each other tight
The search party is over now,
In our last picture the two of us never really died.

This face is buried shallow; this place is okay,
Our birthday, our last day...
Mother, father... carry your son home tonight.
I'm buried shallow, carry your son home...
It doesn't hurt, this kiss will carry me.

We are buried way too shallow, but it's okay.
They'll find us here holding each other tight
The search party is over now,
In our last picture the two of us never really died.
