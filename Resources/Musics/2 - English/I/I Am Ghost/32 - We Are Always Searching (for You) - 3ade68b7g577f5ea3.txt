WE ARE ALWAYS SEARCHING (FOR YOU)

It's a cold dark night, Hallows Eve upon the crest, in a parking lot of
vampires in suits to look their best, and the music, next to coffins made of
gold, with friends and lovers freshly buried.
Her beauty washes over me, so let us hide and we'll dance the night away.
Kiss the rise of the sun, then we'll melt away, that's who we are: we are
always searching, always searching (for you).
In a white dress, with no eyes, black suit red devil bow tie, the King and
Queen are crowned Victorian. "Is this the last of our haunting?" she says as
she floats like an angel. "You will never know until you let me go, I'm
hoping this will never end!"
Her beauty washes over me, so let us hide and we'll dance the night away.
Kiss the rise of the sun, then we'll melt away, thatÂ¹s who we are: we are
always searching, always searching (for you).
The haunting: where we fell in love.
