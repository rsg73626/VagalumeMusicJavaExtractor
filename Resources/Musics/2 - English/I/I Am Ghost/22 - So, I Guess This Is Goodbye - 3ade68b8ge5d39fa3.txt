SO, I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE

So i drew a goodnight kiss,
I said it was all for you
Held your face in time
But the miracles came crashing down

But it was too late; the killers came
With knives and dressed all in blue
As they xxxx me in
I take your hand, well, isn't this romantic?

He's learned a lot from watching you and i (lovely)
Just wish these dreams would follow through

Don't ever be afraid, 'cause i'm never letting go
Of your face since i knew there would be...
Blood spilling from your cut,
The ropes enwrapped you in love
Memories feed this disease
And i hate it

But it was too late, the killers home
And knows you well i assume
As my luck grows thin i take your hand
Well, isn't this romantic?

He's learned a lot from watching you and i (lovely)
Just wish i already knew

Don't ever be afraid, 'cause i'm never letting go
Of your face since i knew there would be blood.
Take these words i say, "will you marry me?" to your grave
I knew you were the one.
This blood is love

You, me, i do, let's float away and die
You, me, i do, let's float away and die

He's learned a lot from watching you and i (lovely)
Tell the preacher to give our last goodbye

Don't ever be afraid, 'cause i'm never letting go
Of your face since i knew there would be blood.
Take these words i say, "will you marry me?" to your grave
I knew you were the one,
The one, the one!
I knew there would be blood
