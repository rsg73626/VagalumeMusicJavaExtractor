SMILE OF A JESUS FREAK

Jesus mother mary won't approve of this xxxx and now i hate you
She's testing me lays still beside the music
Sweet kerosene i'm paralyzed, this loaded gun to my head says,
"it's over..." then she pulls the trigger, i've dreamt of this before
She licks the tears that run down my face
She said i'd be so pretty dead
I'm feeling fully cheated as i'm lying in the backseat
My eyes and lips are sewn; it's love you'll never know
The music keeps me breathing as she's smiling in the backseat
(so sit around and watch me burn, watch me burn motherfucker)
Jesus mother mary what should i do? the booze and pills will heal
And love you. i'm fast asleep just kissed and killed a stranger
Sweet kerosene, i'm paralyzed, this loaded gun to my head says,
"it's over..." then she pulls the trigger, i've dreamt of this before
She licks the tears that run down my face
She said i'd be so pretty dead
I'm feeling fully cheated as i'm lying in the backseat
My eyes and lips are sewn; it's love you'll never know
The music keeps me breathing as she's smiling in the backseat
(and all the king's horses, and all the king's men,
Couldn't put her face back together... again!
There's something wrong inside this room, so pretentious! )
So kiss the addict now, she's got a gun and a lonely lonely picture,
She'll kill and laugh out loud, yea!
She said i'd be so pretty dead
I'm feeling fully cheated as i'm lying in the backseat
My eyes and lips are sewn; it's love you'll never know
The music keeps me breathing as she's smiling in the backseat
She says i'm so pretty dead
I'm feeling fully cheated as i'm lying in the backseat
So dead, i'm so dead, i'm feeling fully cheated as she's smiling in the backseat
