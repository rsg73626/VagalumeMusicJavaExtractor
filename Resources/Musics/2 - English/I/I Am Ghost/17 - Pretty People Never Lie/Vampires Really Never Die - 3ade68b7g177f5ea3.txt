PRETTY PEOPLE NEVER LIE/VAMPIRES REALLY NEVER DIE

Look how you've grown, it's etched in skin and bone, 
dressed in make-up and
bleached out in the roses. 
That's hollow and tasteless, 
where spirits make
love and pretty corpses hold their brides.
Do you know I'd never hurt you? 
(I loved you so much, we are not broken, we
are deathless.)
So taste "it" and we will never be alone, 
I'll take the first bite, 
yeah, I am Ghost, 
say goodnight to you, my darling, my darling.
Few words can kill me, 
they inspire in your hands!
The sun outside these glass-shaped walls will burn the flesh off paper
dolls, 
my lips and tongue they bleed... We won't fall, 
we'll be together,
just the two of us. That's hollow and breathless, 
it kills me slowly, 
I'm lost and lonely!
Do you know I'd never hurt you? 
(I loved you so much, we are not broken, we
are deathless.)
So taste "it" and we will never be alone, 
I'll take the first bite, yeah, 
I am Ghost, say goodnight to you, my darling, my darling.
I am so sorry, so take this rose and break this bottle of aged pills,
taste the blue ones and we will sleep through December. 
Awake to the birth of an angel, she has your eyes, 
and I will hide them, don't worry. 
And soon she will grow, I can't believe this is all my fault, 
yeah, soon she will grow, unbury me, 
and put me back together again. 
Taste it! Sad rose for life
because I am already dead!
So taste "it" and we will never be alone, I'll take the first bite, 
yeah, I am Ghost, say goodnight to you, my darling, my darling.
