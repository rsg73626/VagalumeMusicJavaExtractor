DON'T WAKE ME

I was alone wasting away, true son do not die
I was the poison and you were the kiss
angel take a breath now
this ghost inside you hurts,
and I never said goodbye
Don't wake up (don't wake up); there is a sickness in the roses
(that you hold) hold me and drown
unfortunate kiss is too close to see
true son do now cry. yea, fly away, this is war
angel take a breath now, this ghost inside you hurts
and I never said goodbye
don't wake up (don't wake up) there is a sickness in the roses
(that you hold) hold me and drown
don't wake up (don't wake up) there is a sickness in the roses
(that you hold) can you stay for a while? take my hand and let's
set ourselves on fire. they say that love is war...
(pictures light the dead, we don't need them anyway)
I can feel the headlights burning; we descend as the glass stops
breaking, Angel sweet angel don't wake up. don't wake up.
don't wake up...
don't wake up (don't wake up) there is a sickness in the roses
(that you hold) hold me and drown
don't wake up (don't wake up) there is a sickness in the roses
(that you hold) can you stay for a while? take my hand and let's
set ourselves on fire. they say that love is war...
(let go of winter) they say that love is war...
