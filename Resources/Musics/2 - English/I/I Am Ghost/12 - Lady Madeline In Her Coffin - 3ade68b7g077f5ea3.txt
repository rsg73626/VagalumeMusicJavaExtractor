LADY MADELINE IN HER COFFIN

There was a time when stillness meant nothing to me.
Once, silence meant lack of sound; Fall came once a year.
I danced, redcheeked, each year's first snow,
tongue out to taste each flake's welcome sting.
I laughed, distinct from nature's cycles,
A scrap of wonder, floating in a torrent of sorrow I couldn't grasp.
That laugh, mouth open, sums up my past.
I craved fulfillment, too shallow to know
I could never be fully filled again.

Here we are and it's open. I lay her down in the glow (half of creation's
destruction). Replaced the moon and the stars with candles. Black and Grey
is to drown, when yesterday
Fades (through broken glass). Hate (what I've become).
Enclosed, please find Silence.
Fade (through broken glass). Hate (what I've become).
Enclosed please find Silence,
Everything's shallow, we're chasing ourselves beneath a stone,
I am covered in make-up that won't wash away beneath a stone.
We are joy. I was just a boy. Goodnight.
Beauty scar, powdered make-up, melting eyes, smile of bone. I replaced the
moon and the stars with candles. We are all the same when everything
Fades (through broken glass). Hate (what I've become).
Enclosed, please find Silence.
Fade (through broken glass). Hate (what I've become).
Enclosed please find Silence,
EverythingÂ¹s shallow, we're chasing ourselves beneath a stone,
I am covered in make-up that won't wash away beneath a stone.
We are joy, so take my hand.
Sing inside the shadows she surrounds the love I hid. The beating of a god
that won't let go. I know, Black and Grey is to drown in yesterday.
We are joy, so take my hand.
