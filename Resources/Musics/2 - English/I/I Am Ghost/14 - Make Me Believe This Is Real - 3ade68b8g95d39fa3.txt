MAKE ME BELIEVE THIS IS REAL

Make me believe that this is real
A touch of skin that hides the dying, i've lost the feel
That breaks up the living from the dead
I've lost you in this place of nightmares that scream inside my head
Separated from the body, hand over your soul please
Don't scream, just tell me what is real
Let's seize the day; dark thunder will light my way
Lovers left under stars to hang
I'm never ok, it's never ok
Bring out the ghosts from bodies that will haunt you
Taking the life left from this room
Of ballet dancers without faces as they move
(so cold) slowly pretty lover sure to drown,
Too late to realize that i was the one buried in the ground
Separated from the body, hand over your soul please
Don't scream, just tell me what is real
Let's seize the day; dark thunder will light my way
Lovers left under stars to hang
I'm never ok, it's never ok
Bring out the ghosts from bodies that will haunt you
Separated from the body, hand over your soul please
Now scream, and tell me what is real...
Make me believe that this is real
A touch of skin that hides the dying, i've lost the feel
