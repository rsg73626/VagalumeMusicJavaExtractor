SET ME FREE

I need someone to hold onto and cry,
It was you but now your dead and gone, baby,
I need a new pair of shoes
A place to hide how ugly i am,
Tonights the night,

This is the best day ever

Pain, of a love i gave to you
But never spoke to me
Believe the kiss was better than i
Stay with me
I alone am by myself
Will this set me free?
Take my hand
I jump into the sea,

I need someone to hold onto and die,
It wasn't you
So now i think i'm done with life,
The mirror has no reflection
But a curse
I know i'm so ugly
It hurts,

This is the best day ever,

Pain of love i gave to you
But never spoke to me,
Believe the kiss was better than i
Stay with me
I alone am by myself
Will this set me free?
Take my hand,
I jump into the sea

So, i know it's been so long,
I know it's been so long,
Killing me,
It's wrecking me,

Pain of a love i gave to you
But never spoke to me,
Believe the kiss was better than i
Stay with me
I alone am by myself
Will this set me free?
Take my hand as i jump into the sea,

Pain of a love i gave to you
But never spoke to me,
Believe the kiss was better than i
Stay with me
I alone am by myself
Will this set me free?
Take my hand,
I jump into the sea
