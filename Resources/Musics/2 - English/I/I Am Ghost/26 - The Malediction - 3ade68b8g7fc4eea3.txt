THE MALEDICTION

Kiss this girl of stone
My regrets are thin and corse
They are soaked outside the sea
This ship has sailed through fantasy

Create this beautiful... memory of love
A Dance with the dead
It does exist
We still remain

Black vale and cross
Cut away this mist and fog... 
and follow your heart 
Frozen past and tears from God
Kiss these nightmares; my enemy
Dark angel clouds
Thieves and the wicked
they do not make a sound...

We will love... we will love...

Create this beautiful... memory of love
A Dance with the dead
It does exist
We still remain

... still remain.... still remain.... 
(scream) LOST!!!!

kiss these nightmares
ugly sounds
from the sea as she cries....
Don't give up!

Create this beautiful... memory of love
A Dance with the dead
It does exist
We still remain
Create this beautiful... memory of love
A Dance with the dead
It does exist
We still remain... 
I still remain... with you
I remain with you
... with you
