ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL MURDER

Crashed through the window going way too fast
Sized up the bodies,
Just cuts and bruises shot to the head relapse,
It's nice to see you're standing over me, and you're not smiling
(you're not smiling! ) taking pictures like i'm already dead
This whole living thing is way too over rated (just relax)
Pissed away the luck i had, a menu full of sex and drugs and poison
Would have stopped it all just to hear them scream
It's nice to see you're standing over me, and you're not smiling
(you're not smiling! ) taking pictures like i'm already dead
This whole living thing is way too over rated...
So cover us in sheets, and move a little closer
Our high school murder is over
So can we rest in pieces? just cover me in roses
Our high school murder is over
We had it all, then died by the gun,
Cover me in sheets, don't come any closer now
It really breaks my heart for you to see what i've become
Crashed through the window just to hold your hand
So cover us in sheets, and move a little closer
Our high school murder is over
So can we rest in pieces? just cover me in roses
Our high school murder is over
So cover us in sheets, and move a little closer
Our high school murder is over
