I saw you out the window, 
as the blood-line fills this town with razors, 
I saw you out that window... 
it is not the same... 
her face was gone and dead.
You said you can not love, 
instead you fade away, 
we will dress her up in fairy-tales, 
yes to me it is all the same, 
and i am sorry for the love you gave to me... woa
I saw you out the window, 
as the blood-line fills this town with razors, 
I saw you out that window, 
it is all the same, 
this town is gone and dead.
I saw you there, 
as the day turns to night, 
but please forgive and give me a chance to see me rise, yes, 
to see me rise again... again, yes again... again... 
yes you will see me rise.
I saw you out the window, 
as the blood line fills this town with razors,

her face is gone... and dead.... 
i'm dead, i'm dead, 
this town is gone and dead, 
i'm dead, i'm dead!!!
