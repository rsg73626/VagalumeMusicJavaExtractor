THEY ALWAYS COME BACK

I brushed away the sticks and mud that covered your face.
A pretty smile stares directly at the sunlight
You skin has turned blue, your not alone.

I found a place where they could never hurt you
A place where everyday is halloween
A lovely state of mind where we can run free
Let's bring back the colours then take our picture
This coffin meant for you and me
We'll sing to the others and dance in pictures
We'll live again for everyone to see

It doesn't seem to scare you like it did me
This love's a virtue
Never seemed so fun
(never seemed so fun)

I found a place where they could never hurt you
A place where everyday is halloween

Let's bring back the colours then take our picture
This coffin meant for you and me
We'll sing to the others and dance in pictures
We'll live again for everyone to see

This place where we died
I'm such a sucker for a pretty girl in black
An skin so white

Let's bring back the colours then take our picture
This coffin meant for you and me
We'll sing to the others and dance in pictures
We'll live again for everyone to see

A place where everyday is halloween
A lovely state of mind where we can run free

We'll live again for everyone to see
(to see.)
