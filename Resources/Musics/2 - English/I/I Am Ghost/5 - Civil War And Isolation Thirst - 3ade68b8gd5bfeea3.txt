CIVIL WAR AND ISOLATION THIRST

Two in the morning and it is last call, the taste of wine that's tattooed on
my collar, yeah, and I am sober, and the bouncers are all dead, with a
lonely kiss from the love I missed, I will drink tonight!
She says, "Lets put this stake right through our heart," to kill all the
loneliness babe? We'll never be apart!
Soon we'll see the sun rise, soon we'll see the sun again.
(I have my best suit on!)
I'm so tired, it's killing me as she slits my throat with the pen I wrote,
"Civil War and 13." So sever the letter, you love it, you need it, I can't
die tonight, no, no, no, no, no, no!!! And I'm still sober, and the
bouncers are all dead, with a lonely kiss from the love I missed, I will
drink tonight!!!
She says, "Lets put this stake right through our heart," to kill all the
loneliness babe? We'll never be apart!
Soon we'll see the sun rise, soon we'll see the sun again.
We'll see the sun, we will fall in love...again...
(Thanks for the memories), last dance with The Silence, I was so, so in
love, you know I appreciate it but I can not take it, never, NEVER again!
Never again, never again, never again, so, I will drink to you...
She says, "Lets put this stake right through our heart," to kill all the
loneliness babe? We'll never be apart!
Soon we'll see the sun rise, soon we'll see the sun again.
