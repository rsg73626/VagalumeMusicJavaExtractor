WE DANCE WITH MONSTERS

It´s the making of our story
A passing, dead and gone
Fairy tales, weird mistery and monsters
Sang an song
Even know this lives are ended
Theyr memory Will carry on
A beautiful mirror Will Begin
And our heroes will stand strong
There´s a place only thedead know
Real corpses dance and our true heart
it´s the making of our story
Where the dead they do not hide
