BATTLEFIELD

My body is a battlefield
Everyday under fire
Light me up like the 4th of July
Powder and paint
Trim, buff and stain
A face you don't recognize
My body is battlefield

Won't you come out and play tonight
Baby, you'll get the fight of your life

You say
Ooh, you'd be better off if you could learn
to love what you've got, love what you've got
Nip, tucking your shit it won't make the pain stop
You say
Ooh, you'd be better off if you could learn
to love what you've got, love what you've got
fucking with your body won't make you hot

For all of the fame
For all of the glory
This fight's a game
The most tragic story
It's a war for the shallow
for the empty, for the cruel and the vicious
For the plastic crown
Detox and pluck
mold, stuff and suck
A woman in full disguise
My body is a battlefield

Baby I'm out for blood tonight
I don't care if I'm wrong or I'm right

You say
Ooh, you'd be better off if you could learn
to love what you've got, love what you've got
Nip, tucking your shit it won't make the pain stop
You say
Ooh, you'd be better off if you could learn
to love what you've got, love what you've got
fucking with your body won't make you hot

Ring the bells, sound the horns
Tell everyone you know
Take a bow
All hail the Queen of the Battlefield
Baby all is fair in love and war
And I never play to lose
