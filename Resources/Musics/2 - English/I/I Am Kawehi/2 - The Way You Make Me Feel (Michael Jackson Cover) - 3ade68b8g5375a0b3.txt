THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL (MICHAEL JACKSON COVER)

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(The way you make me feel)
You knock me off of my feet
(The way you make me feel)
My lonely days are gone
(The way you make me feel)

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby
you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(The way you make me feel)
You knock me off of my feet
(The way you make me feel)
My lonely days are gone
(The way you make me feel)

I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(The way you make me feel)
You knock me off of my feet
(The way you make me feel)
My lonely days are gone
(The way you make me feel)

Go on girl!

Give it to me
Give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl
I wanna be with mine
(The way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business but mine and my baby
(The way you make me feel)
Go on girl!
