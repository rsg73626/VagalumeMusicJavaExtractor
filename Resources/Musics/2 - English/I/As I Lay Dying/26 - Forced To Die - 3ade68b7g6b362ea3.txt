FORCED TO DIE

Exhausted beyond repair 
Stripped of all I had 
Forced to die inside 
Nw Ibreathe a renewed Life 
I is now I see without my eyes 
If this is what it takes 
To bring me to my knees 
Then feed me pain until 
I realize I am but a slave 
Remind me of my need for You 
Remind me of who I am
