THE PAIN OF SEPARATION

how can i bear this any longer
arms stretched out only to hold separation
take me away
iâ€™m dying inside, emptied before you
take me into your arms
i will fight until the day when i will see
sight given to these blind eyes
when will i be taken from this life?
take what is Yours
you deserve more than my life
