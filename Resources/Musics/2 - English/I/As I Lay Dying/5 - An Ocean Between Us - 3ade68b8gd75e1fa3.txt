AN OCEAN BETWEEN US

How many years have we waited
for a ship that never set sail?
And how many days have we wasted
chasing a love that was not our own?
I sat ashore and watched
as one hopeless wave crashed upon another
while my thoughts ran to the highest hills
my heart never reached the sea
with only delusions of an endless journey
I am left with an ocean between you and me

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
of someone else’s dream

The gate to my heart has been weld shut
with the splendor of my aspirations closed in
how many years have we waited
for a ship that never set sail?
And how many days have we wasted
chasing a love that was not our own?

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
of someone else’s dream
