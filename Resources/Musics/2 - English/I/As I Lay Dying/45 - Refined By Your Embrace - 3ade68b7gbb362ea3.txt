REFINED BY YOUR EMBRACE

I cannot make it without You 
All my efforts have failed 
So that I will cry out in the need of You 
Restore the strength of my Dependence 
Send me through the fire 
Make me pure again 
Everything I am 
I give it all to You 
In Your arms I wait 
I lay down my life 
I am nothing without You
