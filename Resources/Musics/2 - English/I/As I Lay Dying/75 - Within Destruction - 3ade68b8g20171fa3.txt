WITHIN DESTRUCTION

If music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart
Then i will write the darkest song
For without forgiveness my soul is lost
All that is hope within destruction comes from You
For i have fallen, and there is nothing good within me
Yet i've been given life i will never deserve
For without forgiveness my soul is lost
