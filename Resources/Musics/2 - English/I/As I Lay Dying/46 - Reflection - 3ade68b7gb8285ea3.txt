REFLECTION

I laid the night before me.
Unraveled the tangles of my heart. 
All I felt was stale hollow air.

These streams of uncertainty
They are collapsing upon my mind.
Torments fill my veins until I burst
With mistaken guilt and shame.

My battered bones try to keep 
fighting against this endless 
ocean of self denial.

As time goes on
Some months are yet to pass.

Puddles of ink surround this tired chair.
All of my sorrow has been spilled into
My reflection.
