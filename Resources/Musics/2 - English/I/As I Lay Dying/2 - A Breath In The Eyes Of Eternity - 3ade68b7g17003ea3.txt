A BREATH IN THE EYES OF ETERNITY

Emptiness running through me 
Taking all that i am 
Leaving me this blinding mask 
Grasping for the wind 
Everything I've done 
Everything I've gained 
It all means nothing 
A mere breath has passed away 
Sadness I embrace 
Left with empty promises 
I look at myself and see the scars 
That are brought to me by this life 
Then I ask myself 
Is that all this world has to give 
The chase is over I am finished 
Stripped of every reason I cry out to You 
From my knees I scream
