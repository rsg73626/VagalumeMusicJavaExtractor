REINVENTION

you brought existence to what i never thought could be
a world where eternity finds description
i followed a dream only to be left in reality
you reminded me of the unexplainable
and then reshaped me by your beauty
knowing you has reinvented love in my heart
the perfection of loveâ€™s true existence experirienced for the first time
i tried so hard to wake from this dreamâ€¦
but instead realized that i never fell asleep
