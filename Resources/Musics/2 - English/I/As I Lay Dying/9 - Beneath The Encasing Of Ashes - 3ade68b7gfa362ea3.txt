BENEATH THE ENCASING OF ASHES

Reach inside of me 
Far beneath the encasing of ashes 
Bleeding red 
Still showing signs of life 
Remove the darkness 
Take me away 
A Stream of Hope destroy this corrupted cell 
Purification 
(Leaving me desolate in the face of perfection) 
Unable to hide I am drawn to the fire 
It is this pain that brings me likely do
