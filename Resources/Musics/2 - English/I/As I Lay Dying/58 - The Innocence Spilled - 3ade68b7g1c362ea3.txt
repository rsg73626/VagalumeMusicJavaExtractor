THE INNOCENCE SPILLED

For so long I was deceived 
Enslaved by these chains 
Blinded to Your forgiveness 
If only I knew Your love 
Giving Your life to save me from this pain 
Broken and bleeding I turned You away 
Now I have seen the scars inflicted by my hands 
The Innocence spilled to save me 
Reaching to the hand that brought You this pain 
And now I am on my knees 
Crying the way You wept for me 
Crying, crying tears of shame 
Dying, dying to take away their pain 
I hear the screams of those who call from the grave 
Dying for me to take their pain
