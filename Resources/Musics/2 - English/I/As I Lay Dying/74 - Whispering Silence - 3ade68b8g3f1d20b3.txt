WHISPERING SILENCE

Each little piece begins to stack up
Now suffering under the weight of my choices
And i hardly recognize myself
Somewhere along the line
There stopped being lines at all
(whispering silence)

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who i once was
Slowly changing
Who i once was

Each moment seemed so small
When looked at by itself
But it adds up
And it has torn me down
All lines are gone
(whispering silence)

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who i once was
Slowly changing
Who i once was

So close the truth
But still impossible

It was never one thing
And too many to try to add up
Fueled by faint deception
Conflict without acknowledging opposition

All because i had taken pride in my hidden lies

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who i once was
Slowly changing
Who i once was
It was never one thing
And too many to try to add up

All because i had taken pride in my hidden lies
