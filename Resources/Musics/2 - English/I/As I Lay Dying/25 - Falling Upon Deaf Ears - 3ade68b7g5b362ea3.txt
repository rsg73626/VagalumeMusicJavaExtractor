FALLING UPON DEAF EARS

the sound of silent voices surveying my thoughts 
regularity defining perfection 
neither sorrow nor contentment 
whispering emptiness, frail words collapse 
my weight only stirs the ground 
how long can i hold your hand as you walk over graves 
you search for tears of compassion 
yet find the comfort of winter 
reassurance dead like the falling leaves 
losing hope in your unchanging ways 
all of my strength cannot save you 
if you are unwilling to help yourself
