PARALYSED

What is certain I have ignored
I have spent most of my live trying to complicate everything that I believe
So that while paralysed in thought I will always have an alibi
Just another excuse to hesitate delaying the progress with passivity

The answers that I've found are all the same
They uncover questions that still remain
The answers that I've found are all the same
They uncover questions that still remain

What is certain I have ignored
And what I know is simple if I am honest with myself
My soul is broken yet easily fixed
And what I know is simple
I must die if I truly want to live

The answers that I've found are all the same
They uncover questions that still remain
The answers that I've found are all the same
They uncover questions that still remain

The greatness of us have become the least
I must be reborn to revive a heart that hardly beats
Keeping alive this hollow frame

I must be reborn
I must be reborn.
