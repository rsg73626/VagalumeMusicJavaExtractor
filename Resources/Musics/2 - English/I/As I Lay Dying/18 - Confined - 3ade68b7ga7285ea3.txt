CONFINED

That night I never came home
Wandering souls captured my thoughts
Emptiness filled my mind
Urgency spoke her lies 
in the confines of these grey walls

I watched them move together
Taking me places I cannot remember
We have been poured out into a loveless bride

How quickly I forget that this is meaningless?

In a world passing through my fingers
I still chase the wind

What have I learned from yesterday?
