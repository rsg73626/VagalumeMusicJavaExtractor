MY OWN GRAVE

The lies, the weight
It's clear I've lost my way
Deceit, decay. Decomposing

I thought I was an architect
But I was just moving dirt
Stacking mud over malice
Covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt
I hadn't been building (building)
The time was spent digging (digging)
Boring the barriers that kept others away (away)
The deeper the walls
the less anyone could hear (hear me) fall
So now I know there is no one else to blame

Buried alive inside my own grave
And there is no one else to blame
Buried alive inside my own grave
*Inside of my own grave*

Beneath my lies
Delusional enough to think I'd designed something great
Like a giant headstone inscribed
to describe my shameful fate
I hadn't been building (building)
The time was spent digging (digging)
An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape
(escape)
Nowhere left to hide
and then finally forced to face
What I've become
