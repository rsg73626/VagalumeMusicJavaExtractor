EMPTY HEARTS

I've watched them build upon these empty hearts.
False hopes of lossless paradise.
Gathering together the dead hearts beat as one.

Stillborn comfort feeding lies
Through the lies of self denial.
Devided between a dissolute self
And the sorrow of sincere devotion.

What is it that you find peace in now?
Where is your hope in this dark night?
