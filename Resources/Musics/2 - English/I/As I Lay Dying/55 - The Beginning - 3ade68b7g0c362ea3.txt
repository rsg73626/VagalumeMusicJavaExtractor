THE BEGINNING

i see who you are and who else can compare
i meant what i said
i promised to stand by your side
until the end, thatâ€™s where we begin
from here to eternity
we begin understanding
it is our hearts that define what has meaning in life
some will ask how can this be
but it was you who made me feel
