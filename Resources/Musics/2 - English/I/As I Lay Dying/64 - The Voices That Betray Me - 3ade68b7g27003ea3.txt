THE VOICES THAT BETRAY ME

Shatter my emotions 
Take them all away 
Left alone to face You 
Now You know my heart 
Left only to speak what is true 
See through this plague of flesh 
With truth I say that I love You 
Yet my heart betrays me 
Be not far from me 
For these voices 
They must soon cease 
Despite their betrayal 
You died for me
