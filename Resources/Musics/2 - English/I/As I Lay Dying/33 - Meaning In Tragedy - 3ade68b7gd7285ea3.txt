MEANING IN TRAGEDY

I have traveled so far to find so little
Meaning in tragedy or tragedy in the search for meaning.
Dark clouds have lead me here.
Confined freedom guides us to security.

What if everything I have been taught is a lie?
And all my teachers have been wrong this whole time?

Compelling us to fight the battles,
They would not.
They have already won and we have already lost.
If we do not learn from their mistakes
We have already lost.
If we do not learn to change.
