94 HOURS

94 hours of regret for me to realize what I held 
Unfading beauty, not just a face
I held its innocence within my heart
Go!
Now I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
Now I
I won't let go
Now I
I won't let go
The torment of your eyes has awakened my soul.
The torment of your eyes has awakened my soul.
The pain of a moment's time will forever beg your forgiveness
Forgiveness
94 hours for me to realize
I held unfading beauty
I held your innocence
