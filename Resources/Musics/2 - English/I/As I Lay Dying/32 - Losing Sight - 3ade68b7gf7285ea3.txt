LOSING SIGHT

How could we lose sight of what matters most?
Trying to love what cannot love us back.
All we have is not worth living for
If we do not know when to let go.

What is this life that we cling to it so tight
Afraid that it will take from us these fading sentiments?

Can we die to live another day?
