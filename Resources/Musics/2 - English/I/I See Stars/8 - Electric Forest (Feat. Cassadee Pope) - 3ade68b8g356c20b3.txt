ELECTRIC FOREST (FEAT. CASSADEE POPE)

Let go of everything you have inside
Let it show, you no longer have to hide

I'll be there with you 'til the end's upon us
when our eyes collide, I know you well
Your stare sees directly through me

It's almost dead silence when the lights go out
I like to make believe that I have the show shut down
'Cause then I feel relieved when the bass slowly sounds
A crystal light shines and echoes through the crowd

The people erupt and I become a part of the
machine that moves directly to the beat and I
am one with you and everyone who's heart is here
Let yourself go, this is the only time to feel alive
This brings me out to you and I'll say

I'll scream it 'til my heart comes out of my chest
and leave it to the music to transcend the rest
This life is just a perfect fit... for a mess like me
(So many reasons to live; I need to to let them show
I've made the hardest mistakes; I need to let them go.)
I feel the tempo rise. My eyes open wide
I feel the well that is my heart overflow
and now I'm losing control

These flashing lights got me lifted off the ground
What could go wrong? What could go wrong
when all of us are together?
Never thought it would come down to this

For the first time in my mind
everything's coming to life

I'll paint a picture in my head
for the best
I'll be the person to let us all see
everything hard to define
