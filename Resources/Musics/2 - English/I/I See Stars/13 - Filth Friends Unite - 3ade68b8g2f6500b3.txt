FILTH FRIENDS UNITE

You all know the fucking score
Everybody on the floor

Put 
your 
hands
where I can see them
We're not playing around

One little move
And you're in the ground

We live on our own set of rules
Take everything and everyone down with you
We are a desperate kind
But this is a ruthless time

When I hit rock bottom
I go looking friends in the filthiest places
Yeah, yeah
I make ends meat cause I'm a bad bad man
When I hit rock bottom, the party has arrived
We won't be taken alive

We live on our own set of rules
Take everything and everyone down with you
We are a desperate kind
But this is a ruthless time

What if they just shut the lights out
You're so stuck in your digital world
What happens now?

What if they just shut the lights out
And all the city lights go black
What happens now?

What if they just shut the lights out
Your so stuck in your digital world
What happens now
Lights out

Lights out
