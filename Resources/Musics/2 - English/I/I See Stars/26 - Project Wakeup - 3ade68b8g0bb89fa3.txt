PROJECT WAKEUP

Don't make me say this twice
You know I'm right,
It's time to, its time to wake up
I can't stress this enough

You stare at me like I don't care,
I just don't want to fall asleep to another nightmare
To another nightmare

Whatever helps you sleep

I don't have any intentions
Of spinning you from this direction
So live on and don't ask any questions

You say that everything's okay,
But is everything really okay?
I don't think that everything's okay

You stare at me like I don't care
I just don't want to fall asleep to another nightmare
To another nightmare

No, the revolution is now
