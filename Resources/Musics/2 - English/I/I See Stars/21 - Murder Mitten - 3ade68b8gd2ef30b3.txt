MURDER MITTEN

You won't see me die here!

You always say I need to get as far away as I can
While I've got time to play with and any risk, I'll take it
Or fade away in this suburban wasteland 
And watch all your plans sink right under your feet
Sink right under your feet
Watch all your plans sink right under your feet

Under your feet is the ground to break
You only get what you take
So don't just sit and watch the atrophy of it

I have stood back for way too long
You are broken... You are so broken!

I can see that
We may be running out of time
The curtain's falling in slow motion
I can feel that the sense has left your mind
The curtain's falling in slow motion

Why did you go? I can't watch
So quiet and peaceful where did I go wrong
Say you can stay I can't look away

You won't see me die here
You won't see me die here!

Now! Now!
Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
Now! Now!
Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
Why? Why?
Ask me why?
Go ahead and act like you... don't know why
Why? Why?
Ask me why?
I'll scream it... you blow me away

You blow me away
You blow me away

Can you give me my breath back? [x4]

Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
[x2]

Do you hear me now?
