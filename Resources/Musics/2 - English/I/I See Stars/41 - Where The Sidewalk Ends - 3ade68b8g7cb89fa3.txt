WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS

My eyes shut and head faced down
Sick, hurt, turned upside down
Was this worth the waiting
In the past when I was living it up
And now I'm broken up screaming how I'm so sorry
Just show me this once [2x]
And would you show me a sign and I'll decide
If you are real for me
Brave man seeks through dark alleys
Without love his spawn arrives
I see that I am so sorry
Please just forgive me for taking lives
Is this real
I can feel it but I can't see it [2x]

Can't seem to explain the speed of my heartbeat
Can't help but smile can't help but stay for a while
I am so lost without you
Why every time I run your there
You end up right there behind me
Were not alone

It's not mine
