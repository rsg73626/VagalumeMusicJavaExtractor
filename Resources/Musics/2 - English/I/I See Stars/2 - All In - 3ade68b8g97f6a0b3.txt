ALL IN

Hands on my face cause I'm all in
double zeros I am all in
I'm just a kid come from nothing
I see your family got something
Dragging your feet like it's nothing
all cross the board yeah I'm all in
All cross the states yeah you fallin
we takin' risks yeah we all in

We disappeared from all the lights
There was nothing left, so we went right
Remember the days we were callin
no word when we needed you all in
Mobbin' the house that we all in
we takin' risks yeah we all in

You say the water's under bridges
but you know the bridge is burning
The clock is tickin by the second
I know that time is turning
I see the people you fuck with
they holdin' a knife to your back
Hands in the air cause they all in
we takin risks yeah we all in

Mobbin' the house that we all in
we takin' risks yeah we all in

I can tell that everybody in this room is really scared
No one round me giving feelings like they really care
I know my people at home yeah they be really there
I know my people at home

Breathing in, I'm having trouble
trying to bite my tongue again
Breathing in
don't think that I can just bite my tongue again
Who are you at heart, who are you at all, we'll see

I can tell that everybody in this room is really scared
No one round me giving feelings like they really care
I know my people at home yeah they be really there
Mobbin' the house that we all in
we takin' risks yeah we all in

We takin' risks yeah we all in

You say the water's under bridges
but you know the bridge is burning
The clock is tickin by the second
I know that time is turning
I see the people you fuck with
they holdin' a knife to your back

Breathing in, I'm having trouble
trying to bite my tongue again
Breathing in
don't think that I can just bite my tongue again
Who are you at heart, who are you at all, we'll see

Hands on my face cause I'm all in
double zeros I am all in
All cross the board yeah we all in
We takin' risks man we all in
