ELECTRIC FOREST

Let go of everything you have inside.
Let it show, you no longer have to hide.

I'll be there with you 'til the end's upon us;
When our eyes collide, I know you well.
Your stare sees directly through me.

It's almost dead silence when the lights go out.
I like to make believe that I have the show shut down.
'Cause then I feel relieved when the bass slowly sounds.
A crystal light shines and echoes through the crowd.

The people erupt and I become a part of the
Machine that moves directly to the beat and I
Am one with you and everyone who's heart is here.
Let yourself go, this is the only time to feel alive.
This brings me out to you and I'll say.

I'll scream it 'til my heart comes out of my chest
And leave it to the music to transcend the rest.
This life is just a perfect fit... for a mess like me.
(So many reasons to live; I need to to let them show.
I've made the hardest mistakes; I need to let them go.)
I feel the tempo rise. My eyes open wide.
I feel the well that is my heart overflow,
And now I'm losing control.

These flashing lights got me lifted off the ground.
What could go wrong? What could go wrong,
When all of us are together?
Never thought it would come down to this.

For the first time in my mind,
Everything's coming to life.

I'll paint a picture in my head,
For the best.
I'll be the person to let us all see
Everything hard to define.
