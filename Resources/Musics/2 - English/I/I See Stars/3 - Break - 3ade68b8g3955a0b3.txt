BREAK

We all lose ourselves along the way
Sometimes we lose ourselves along the way

Did your heart let someone in now
Always waking in your sleep
Your mind's so sick of always asking how
I always end up cutting deep

I'm standing out here in the rain
The whole damn world has gone insane
There's only so much my mind can take
Your heart's about to break

Rest now my muse
The worry is only temporary
Hold all of you for me

Did your heart let someone in now
Always waking in your sleep
Your mind's so sick of always asking how
I always end up cutting deep

We all lose ourselves along the way

I'm standing out here in the rain
The whole damn world has gone insane
There's only so much my mind can take
Your heart's about to break

Leave me
Leave me

There's only so much my mind can take
Your heart's about to break
Our hearts were made to start the healing
Bring back the pain I want to feel it
