SING THIS!

(Featuring Bizzy Bone)

Come on girl, you've got one shot to be with me
You know you drive me crazy,
But I know how to take your breath away, so let's go
Well I don't care what's going down here
You can see me, and I can see you
So let's skip this game, we both feel the same
And I'll show you enough to use

All you do is run through my head
Are you getting tired yet?

Everyone's jumping up and down,
I'm starring at the crowd,
And the dream girls singing the words
And she looks like she needs me
Dance with me and I'll show you what you're missing
And everybody's in town, put your hands up all around
And sing this, sing this 

[Bizzy Bone part]

Everyone's jumping up and down,
I'm starring at the crowd,
And the dream girls singing the words
And she looks like she needs me
Dance with me and I'll show you what you're missing
And everybody's in town, put your hands up all around
And sing this, sing this (2x)
