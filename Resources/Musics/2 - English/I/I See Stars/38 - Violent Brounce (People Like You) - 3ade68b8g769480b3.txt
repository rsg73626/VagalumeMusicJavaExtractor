VIOLENT BROUNCE (PEOPLE LIKE YOU)

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
I see right through you

How many people do you plan to burn?
And all the damage left at every turn
You watched us struggle
And now your parched with a thirst for attention
To fuel the fire of your self obsession
We'll watch you crumble
You are the scum of the world
And we'll watch you fall

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
And we intend to
Let the world know the truth
Let the world know the truth

You sit there and smile so smug in your skin
Second and third chances gone in the wind
I lied, and I begged, I swore I would change
What do expect of me!
Fuck
You'll never know true unity

Look around you
Look around you
Everyone is terrified
One wrong move
One wrong move
And their dream won't survive

You said

"You better keep your fucking mouth shut
I gotta closed mind and no time to lose"
Bow to the stronger element
The truth will outweigh you
All it took was a spark right?

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
I see right through you
People like you are the reason I keep the good so close

People like you are
The reason I keep the good so close
And here you are so impressed with yourself
I see right through you
And we intend to
Let the world know the truth
Let the world know the truth

Watch your back when your out on the town tonight
At every corner I lurk in the dark
like the shadow on these very walls
Put the man on trial
I bet he turn colors that he's never shown

Watch your back when your out on the down tonight
At every corner I lurk in the dark
like the shadow on these very walls

Put the man on trial
I bet he turn colors that he's never shown
