MYSTERY WALL

Your scream it... your scream:
It makes me sick,
And I refuse to bow down to it.
Yes, I refuse to bow down to it.
Yes, I refuse.

I have given up my word;
Have given up it all.
The worst has won, just let me go.
You will never know the worst,
Just giving up with all.
My time is done, just let me go.
All the days I've wasted on you,
I'm moving forward.
I am saved, am saved.

I'll walk away,
And I never plan on looking back.
I'm safe, I've won, I've lived your life
And now I want mine back.

Your scream it... your scream:
It makes me sick.
I won't back down.

I have given up my word;
Have given up it all.
The worst has won, just let me go.
You will never know the worst,
Just giving up with all.
My time is done, just let me go.
All the days I've wasted on you,
I'm moving forward.
I am saved, am saved.

Every single word you say:
Take them back
And shove them down your throat.
If you're looking for reasons to run
Then run back home.

Is there something I can do
To make me new?
Is there something, anything I can say?
Life is here to say.

You told me (what are we waiting for)
That you were there,
And that you'd never regret.
