WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME

Between you and me
I think it's pretty sad
How we're singing the same song
Humming the same songs
Oh wah oh, oh wah oh oh
Don't you see what this meant to me

These are the hard times here to inspire
Convenient how it always works out this way
The message you'll find, heart on a wire
It'll make you say, it'll make you say

"Oh my god, there must be something left to write
The two best words to sum up my whole life."

This is the story of our lives
From the road we sit and watch it pass by
Is this the best use of my time?
Don't worry my love, everything's alright
I'd give just about anything to know she's waiting for me
An eye for an eye, a dream for a dream

The life that I am force fed
I'm scared of the road ahead
Have you listened to a word I've said?
The big picture is my dream is dead

These are the hard times here to inspire
Convenient how it always works out this way
The message you'll find, heart on a wire
Don't you see what this meant

I think it's pretty sad
How we're singing the same song
Humming the same songs
Oh wah oh, oh wah oh oh
Don't you see what this meant to me

(I'd give just about anything to know she's waiting for me)
(An eye for an eye, a dream for a dream)

It'll make you say "oh god, why was I wrong.
I missed all the meaning while it was spelled out all along."
