EVERYONE'S SAFE IN THE TREEHOUSE

I'm just a man with a vision
Who's growing more blind everyday
Eyes of a child now in ruins
Scared of everything he became

My voice wasn't loud enough for you to listen
Your words weren't strong enough for me to stay here

Cause I feel your love has always been empty
Just a way to sink your teeth into me
But the truth is we built our house in a tree
We build the roads we walk upon

I feel you have the worst intentions
Controlling everyone but me
My voice wasn't loud enough
Your words weren't strong enough

Cause I feel your love has always been empty
Just a way to sink your teeth into me
But the truth is we built our house in a tree
We build the roads we walk upon

Are you alive or are you just living?
Are you alive or are you just living?

You don't get it! You'll never get it!
Do you have a life or are you just living?
You don't get it! You'll never get it!
Do you have a life or are you just living?

I feel your love has always been empty
Just a way to sink your teeth into me

Cause I feel your love has always been empty
(Been empty)
Just a way to sink your teeth into me
But the truth is we built our house in a tree
We build the roads we walk upon
We build the roads we walk upon
