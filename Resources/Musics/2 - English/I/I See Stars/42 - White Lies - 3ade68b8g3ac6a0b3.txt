WHITE LIES

You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there

You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there

You said you'd be there 'til the bitter end
Your voice feels bitter now
The world I'm fighting for just plays pretend
I'm surrendering
I'm surrendering
I'm surrendering
Way too long, way too long
Way too long, way too long

I'm not gonna turn my head
You play the part I'm holding out my hands
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight
I feel you in the air. You haunt me everywhere

You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there

White lies
You do this every time
We fall in familiar places
Drift apart and don't know why
Breaths we take, like breaths we take
You're gone. Gone
Breaths we take, like breaths we take
You're gone. You play the part I'm holding out my hands

Way too long, way too long
Way too long, way too long

You said you'd be there 'til the bitter end
Your voice is bitter now
The world I'm fighting for just plays pretend
I'm surrendering

White lies
You do this every time
We fall in familiar places
Drift apart and don't know why
Breaths we take, like breaths we take
You're gone. Gone
Breaths we take, like breaths we take
You're gone. You are the reason for the life I live

You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there

You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
You said you'd be there
Be-be-be-be-be there, be there
