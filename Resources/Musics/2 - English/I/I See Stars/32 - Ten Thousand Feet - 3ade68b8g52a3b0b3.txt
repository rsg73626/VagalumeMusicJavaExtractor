TEN THOUSAND FEET

I swear this plane is going down
Brace yourself, this is not a drill
This is the way that I dream of going out
And in this moment, I see my life flash before my eyes
Before my eyes
And the best I'll be dead til they see
That I waste, everyday

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster
the thought of you begins
Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster
the thought of you begins
Woah
Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster, the thought of you begins
I wish there was a way, to let you know
A way to let you know
I wish there was a way to let you know

I am the living dead
I see my fate
And yours look just like mine
I know you think that their still upon us
I got news for you
We're so fucked
We are the living dead [x4]

I'm writing you a letter
I hope it falls right down in your hands
At least you'll know exactly what the fall goes to plan
I see you know the better tear
in every single bell of lies
No delusion will save your senses
Hope in disguise

Why can't you see, that I fear for the worst
This is what I gave
I'm on your side
Bleh

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster
the thought of you begins

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster
the thought of you begins
Woah

Brace yourself, this is not a drill
This is the way that I dream of going out
And in this moment, I see my life flash before my eyes
Before my eyes
And the best I'll be dead til they see
That I waste, everyday

Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster
the thought of you begins
I wish there was a way, to let you know
I wish there was a way to let you know
Ten thousand feet in the air
And as we're falling faster
the thought of you begins
