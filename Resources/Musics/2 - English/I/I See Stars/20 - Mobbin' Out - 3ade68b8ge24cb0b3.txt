MOBBIN' OUT

It's almost light, I'm laying my head down
I try to smile, but I'm weighing myself down
I'm losing faith everyday that I'm running with you
I'm losing faith everyday
I will not go, I'll make it through the night
I will not go, I'll shine my brighter lights
I will not go, I'll make it through the night
I will not go, I'll shine my brighter lights

If I walk with you, a life of second glances
I gave you hope, you buried your chances
Aren't you the one who said you bled for this?
No, you're the one who left in the first place

How can you just stand there with a straight face telling me
You did the best that you could?
I'm giving up on you, but I'm not giving up on me
Your horse is higher than a skyscraper
Your shadow is starting to fade
Giving up on you, but I'm not giving up on me

I see the light, I think I'm gonna make it out
I miss the times we didn't even have a doubt
The things you said disappear when it's convenient for you
It's time for you to do the same
I will not go, I'll make it through the night
I will not go, I'll shine my brighter lights
I will not go, I'll make it through the night
I will not go, I'll shine my brighter lights

I watched words fall out of your face
Always so numb to the impact you made
Tried so hard to make you see
That you've become invisible to me

I will not go, I'll make it through the night
I will not go, I'll shine my brighter lights
I will not go, I'll make it through the night
I will not go, I'll shine my brighter lights

How can you just stand there with a straight face telling me
You did the best that you could?
I'm giving up on you, but I'm not giving up on me
Your horse is higher than a skyscraper
Your shadow is starting to fade
Giving up on you, but I'm not giving up on me

Aren't you the one who said you bled for this?
No, you're the one who left in the first place
