LATCH

You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me
Even when you're not around
If there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe
Now I know what I have found

I feel we're close enough
I want to lock in you love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm so en-captured
Got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored
Hold me tight within your clutch

How do you do this
You got me losing every breath
What did you give me
To make my heart bleed out my chest

I feel we're close enough
I want to lock in you love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love

I feel we're close enough
I want to lock in you love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
