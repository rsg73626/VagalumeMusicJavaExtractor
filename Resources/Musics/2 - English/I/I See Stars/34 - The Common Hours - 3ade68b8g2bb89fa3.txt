THE COMMON HOURS

As I recall
To the events caused prior to this murder
Why would a good boy do something like this?
Why would a good boy do something like this?
This massacre
No one could've seen this coming
All it took was for them to say
Don't pack your bags cause you're here to stay.

So watch your mouth around the misses
My secrets have been told
I want to reign upon thee
As my case unfolds

She screams my name
As she runs away
My hearts so vicious
You'd do the same

She screams my name
Nothing left to say
There's nothing left here
There's nothing left home

The time to grow up is now (4x)

You just step right into this picture
Expecting things to change
It's not happening

You'll never change
You'll stay the same
You'll never change
At least not for me

The time has come for your
Elimination! Elimination!
Your dead!
