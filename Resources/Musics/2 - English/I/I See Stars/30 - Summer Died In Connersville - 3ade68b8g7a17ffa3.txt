SUMMER DIED IN CONNERSVILLE

I found hope in the world again
And for the first time I feel alright.

Never again.
You can try to scream, but no one's listening.
Never again.
You can try to scream, but no one will hear you.

Life's just a stage.
If just given the chance to save, words could save you all.
I've got the time if you see the light in me
And the words could save us all.

Life's just a stage. Life's just fuckin stage.
If given the chance, words could save us all.
You need to open your eyes;
Expose them from disguise.
This isn't a game, this is our lives.

No, you won't be saved
Unless you're willing to help yourself
To fuel the fire for once.
Let's go.

I will not be controlled.
How's this for a twist of fate?

Life's just a stage.
If just given the chance to save, words could save you all.
I've got the time if you see the light in me
And the words could save us all.

I found hope in the world again
And for the first time I feel alright.
