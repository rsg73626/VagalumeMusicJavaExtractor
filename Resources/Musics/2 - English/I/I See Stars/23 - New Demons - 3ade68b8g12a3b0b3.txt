NEW DEMONS

I'm not your true love
I'm your knight in shining armor
All of these games you play
And all this bullshit drama
I'll be free to be me
And find my path in life

You think I'll die alone?
Well, I'm not alone tonight

Our love was a waste
This much is true
I pray I'd forget you

Yeah
Fuck you

You're no better than anyone
You want respect you have to earn it
Your jealousy won't fall me
Why are you so heartless?

Open up you eyes and you'll see
That I'm not perfect
That's what I'm trying to be

Open up your eyes and you'll see
That I'm not perfect
That's what I'm trying to be
'Cause I know you're worth it
These new demons are changing me inside
Changing me inside

Lock me down to pick yourself back up
Because you hit the depths
In your heart you're still nothing
Always sinking down

I bet you put yourself through hell
You did this to yourself
I can't believe I wished you well
I wished you well

Lock me down to pick yourself back up
Because you hit the depths
In your heart, you're still lost and
Always sinking down

Open up your eyes and you'll see
That I'm not perfect
That's what I'm trying to be
'Cause I know you're worth it
These new demons are changing me inside
Changing me inside

These new demons
They're eating me alive
Pushing and pulling
The heart out from inside

If I can't have you
Then nobody else can
Now

Just the thought of you
Walking hand in hand
With somebody else
Reinventing things we do
But they'll never match
To the love thrown down the well

If I can't have you
Then nobody else can
