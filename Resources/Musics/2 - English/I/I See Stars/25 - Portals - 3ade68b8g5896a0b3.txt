Say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved

I'm just trying to breathe fire
The news took the wind right out of me
There's no relief in the silent
Ways we grieve

One reason for the pain you caused
Two words to mend the damage done
Three left in the chamber of your gun
Four seconds to run

You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
I can feel centered and the world comes with it
I can feel centered and the world comes with it

I just want the world to know it's real

I just want the world to know it's real

It's the colour they see; fire
Never knowing the face behind the name
It's always easy staying quiet
But red's the colour we bleed

One reason for the pain you caused
Two words to mend the damage done
Three left in the chamber of your gun
Four seconds to run

Say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved
You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved

I can feel centered
And the world comes with it
I can feel centered
And the world comes with it

Pinch yourself, shed a tear
Remind yourself the world is real

It's always easy staying quiet
But red's the colour we bleed

I just want the world to know it's real, whoa oh
I just want the world to know it's real

So say you don't believe!
You say you don't believe
It's human nature to me
The moment a bullet leaves
A fool's future is weaved

I can feel centered
And the world comes with it
I can feel centered
And the world comes with it
