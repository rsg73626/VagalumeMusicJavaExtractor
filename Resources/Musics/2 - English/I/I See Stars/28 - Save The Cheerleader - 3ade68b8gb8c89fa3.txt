SAVE THE CHEERLEADER

The hands come from the ground
The hands come from the ground
Don't fear life
We came and saw
This has no meaning
I touch the sky
As it's burning

This bottles half way empty
Cause your glass is half way full
Can you please go without me
I swear that everything's alright
(It's not my money he owes)

And you say
The way we go
It's just as terrible
I can't turn around
Yeah!
Beware, before I allow them running away
Can you run

O whoa o, o whoa o, o wha-ah-oh-o-ah-o

Can't stop while the rhythm is going
Just say the first words that come along to your head
One touch and it's already over
I'm not ready, I'm barley sober
I just can't forget you,
I'd do anything to get you
I don't want to get you,
I just want to forget you.

We can't go back
(And we can't go back)
Take a deep breath
And go for her
And two weeks have past
(I've haven't seen you since)
In spreaded letters
Just forget her

One thing remains
Save the cheerleader,
Save the world!
