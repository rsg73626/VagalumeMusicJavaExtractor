YELLOW KING

I've had this dream before
It's just the ghost of the once was
A fool just like before
The same exact sad outcome

I've meant my enemy
And it seems we tried to work it out
You're just the ghost of the once was

But the stars aren't far enough
For you to grab them
Right out of the sky
There ain't no doubt about it

You ain't no child trying to drive the car, no
You ain't no friend of mine

Nobody seems to fear the truth more than me
It seems I have a darkness
But I can leave it all behind if you let me
Only if you let me
Only if you let me

So lay it on me
So lay it on me
It seems you're so scared of taking chances I'm not
So lay it on me
So lay it on me
I feel the rain

Reoccuring dreams
Pulling out my teeth
In a crowded white room

I try to run or yell
This is my hell
My legs won't move

I've had this dream before
It's just the ghost of the once was
A fool just like before
The same exact sad outcome

I've had this dream before
You're just the ghost of the once was

But the stars aren't far enough
For you to grab them
Right out of the sky
There ain't no doubt about it

You ain't no child trying to drive a fast car, no
You ain't no friend of mine

Nobody seems to fear the truth more than me
It seems I have a darkness
But I can leave it all behind if you let me
Only if you let me
Only if you let me

All this time
I've been waiting to let you go
All this time
I've been waiting to let you go

All this time
I've been waiting to let you go
All this time
I've been waiting to let you go

So lay it on me
So lay it on me
It seems you're so scared of taking chances I'm not
So lay it on me
So lay it on me
I feel the rain
