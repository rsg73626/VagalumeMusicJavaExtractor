THE HARDEST MISTAKES (FEAT. CASSADEE POPE)

So many reasons to live
I need to let them show
I've made the hardest mistakes
I need to let them go

I'll be there with you 'til the end's upon us
when our eyes collide, I know you well
Your stare sees directly through me

Let yourself go
This is the only time to feel alive
This brings me out to you and I'll say

I'll scream it until my heart comes out of my chest
And leave it to the music to transcend the rest
This life is just a perfect fit
