UNDERNEATH EVERY SMILE

So sick of screaming my lungs out;
We both lose.
You're never making a damn sound;
Can't keep my cool.
And I'm thinking it's my time
To crawl back inside my mind;
Am I wasting a second of air?

It's getting hard at the nights grow darker
I realized suffering is far from done;
My dreams have won.
What a waste of my precious time you've been.
I have to give up, I have to give up.

When the cards are down
And the space finally clears,
Hopefully you know...
I'd go trough hell and back for you.

So sick of screaming my lungs out;
We both lose.
You're never making a damn sound;
Can't keep my cool.
And I'm thinking it's my time
To crawl back inside my mind;
Am I wasting a second of air?

Why was it so easy to let me down?
I always thought better of you.
It's coming back around.

You let me relieve my very worst nightmare.
I tried so hard. I tried so hard.
Why was is so easy to let me down?
I tried so hard. I tried so fucking hard.

Speak now or forever be deceived.
I tried so hard. I tried so hard.
Why was it so easy to let me down?
I tried so hard. I tried so fucking hard.
It's coming back around.
