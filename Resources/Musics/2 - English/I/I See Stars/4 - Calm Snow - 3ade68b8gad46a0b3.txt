CALM SNOW

Don't you tell me all them lies
We both know
Don't you tell me how time flies
I'ts so slow

All the love in the world
We both show
But when it comes to something real
We both choke

So tell me how does it feel, to know
That your lies (your lies)
Won't save you now

To know, your lies
Your lies, your lies
Won't save you now

Sorry, sorry

We're watching thing unravel slowly
You're just trying to get away from yourself
Its obvious you're speaking languages I can't read
You just had to get by with someone else

Don't you tell me all them lies
We both know
Don't you tell me how time flies
I'ts so slow

All the love in the world
We both show
But when it comes to something real
We both choke

So tell me how does it feel, to know
That your lies (your lies)
Won't save you now

To know, that your lies
Your lies, your lies
Won't save you now

We're watching thing unravel slowly
You're just trying to get away from yourself
Its obvious you're speaking languages I can't read
You just had to get by with someone else

Your lies, your lies, your lies
Your lies
