ENDLESS SKY (FEAT. DANNY WORSNOP)

I'll take my stand and ask you all to fight
To come together as one
Before they take our rights
You should have known from the start
that some day they'd try
And I told you before
You're all living a lie

Knowing the truth is like a different dimension
There's no going back once you see the lies
I don't know about you
I will rise, I will rise, I will rise

This is our time!
Rise up!
Stand your ground!
We can conquer the king of the world!

Take the time to open up your weary eyes
Are blind to the all the things around us
This is our time
This is our time
To set things right
Get on your feet before it's too late
And tell everyone I know

Sir can you spare some change for me
In this world today
Where people fear the very power that's given to them
You should have know from the start, that some day we'd try
And I tried to tell you before
You're all living a lie

Knowing the truth is like a different dimension
There's no going back once head the lies
I don't know about you
I will rise, I will rise, I will rise
Take the time to open up your weary eyes
Are blind to the all the things around us
This is our time
This is our time
To set things right
Get on your feet before it's too late
This is our time
This is our time
to set things right

Allow me your undivided attention
Let us bring you to the next dimension
I am the alpha omega sent here to expose your lies I am your God now
We'll bring the end to them all
We can conquer the king of the world
