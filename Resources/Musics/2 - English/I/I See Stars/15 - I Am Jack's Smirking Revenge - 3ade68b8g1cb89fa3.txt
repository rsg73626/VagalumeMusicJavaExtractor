I AM JACK'S SMIRKING REVENGE

I know you didn't mean this
As far as I know
Dreams of me, fear of waking, sense of closeness
Goes to show

Your looking for love in all the wrong places
Seeing empty faces, awkward situations
Everything you said was a lie
Who are you pretending to be tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Your looking for love in all the wrong places
Seeing empty faces, awkward situations
Everything you said was a lie
Who are you pretending to be tonight, tonight
(I know you didn't mean this, but something was wrong)

Trying not to think to hard
'Cause I won't wait for you
Times just getting overrated
And this room is getting colder and I know
It's only once you've lost everything, you are free to do anything

All eyes on me, depressants are just the beginning
All I loved, I loved alone
All eyes on me, this won't end with a happy ending
Cause all I loved, I loved alone

Your looking for love in all the wrong places
Seeing empty faces, awkward situations
Everything you said was a lie
Who are you pretending to be tonight, tonight (2x)

And every single word you say
How could I believe
