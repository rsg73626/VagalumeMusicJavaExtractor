ENDLESS SKY

I'll take my stand and ask you all to fight,
To come together as one
Before they take our rights.
You should have known from the start
That some day they'd try,
And I told you before:
You're all living a lie.

Knowing the truth
Is like a different dimension:
There's no going back
Once you see the lies.
I don't know about you,
I will rise [x3]

This is our time, rise up.
Stand your ground.
We can conquer the king of the world.

Take the time
To open up your weary eyes
Are blind to all things around us.
This is our time, this our time
To set things right.
Get on your feet before it's too late
And tell everyone I know.

Sir can you please spare some change for me
In this world today.
Where people fear the very power
That's given to them.
You should have known from the start
That some day we'd try.
And I tried to tell you before:
You're all living a lie.

Knowing the truth
Is like a different dimension:
There's no turning back
Once you hear the lies.
I don't know about you,
I will rise [x3]

Take the time
To open up your weary eyes
Are blind to all things around us.
This is our time, this our time
To set things right.
Get on your feet before it's too late.
This is our time, this our time
To set things right.

Allow me your undivided attention;
Let us bring you to the next dimension.
I am the alpha omega sent to expose your lies.
I am your God now.

We'll bring the end to them all.
We can conquer the king of the world.
