LIGHT IN THE CAVE

It's easy to find the answer
It's always been there I'm always running
To the back of my mind I gather thoughts
And shades I haven't shown yet

Oh how the tables turn
I had my mind made up like a story
That you knew the ending of
I always knew that you were pretending

Yeah, I always knew that you were pretending

Just hold on me
And I'll wipe away the marks they drawn on you
Here it's you and me cause I

I'm holding on by the tips of my fingers
I'm not afraid of the fall
The only thought that the silence the triggers
Is the time I went wrong
Oh, I know I made a fool of us all
Oh, I'm sorry, so sorry. I'm not sorry at all

It's always running, always running
It's easy to find the answer
It's always been there
It's always been there

Oh how the tables turn
I had my mind made up like a story
That you knew the ending of
I always knew that you were pretending

I'm holding on by the tips of my fingers
I'm not afraid of the fall
The only thought that the silence the triggers
Is the time I went wrong
Oh, I know I made a fool of us all
Oh, I'm sorry, so sorry. I'm not sorry at all

It's easy to find the answers
It's always been there I'm always running
To the back of my mind I gather thoughts
And shades I haven't shown yet
