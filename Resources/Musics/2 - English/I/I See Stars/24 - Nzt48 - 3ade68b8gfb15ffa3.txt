NZT48

We are surrounded by harlots
Not today bishop not today miss nuclear
I wish this greed never started
But now we're here and it's time to stand up

You can't really believe
Anything you're hearing, can you?
You can't really believe
Anything you're seeing, can you?

The time to move is now
The fire in my gut
I feel it in my heart
On the tip of my tongue
The time to move is now

No we're not gonna run from truth
It's the world vs one
We're not scared of you
And after all where did the pieces go?
We're here to bust this whole thing wide open
We're here for you reveal the truth

You can't really believe
Anything you're hearing, can you?
You can't really believe
Anything you're seeing, can you?

We're back with a sense of vengeance
To our leaders that let us down
We're not leaving till we get what we want
Own up to your lies and your disregard

We'll charge the throne
We'll set the tone
We'll leave nothing but skind and bone
We'll start the show, reap what we so
We aren't taking this anymore

In god we trust that you'll all be dealt with
You can't escape
You can't escape judgment

Some men just want to watch the world burn
(watch the world burn)
Watch the world burn

The only verdict is vengeance
There's no stopping me now from calling you out
The only verdict is vengeance

No we're not gonna run from truth
It's the world vs one
We're not scared of you
No we're not gonna run from truth
It's the world vs one
We're not scared of you

And after all where did the pieces go
We're here to bust this whole thing wide open

The time to move is now
