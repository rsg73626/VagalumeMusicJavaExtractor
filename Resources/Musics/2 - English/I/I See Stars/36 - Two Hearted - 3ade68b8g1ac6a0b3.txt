TWO HEARTED

The wreck is all
We have to know that this has to end
If there's a chance, the light may follow you home
You know where to find me

You can call it what you want
You can call it moving on
You know it's for the better
I know it's for the better

The past is all we had
When I think about the way we used to be
You seem to think you're invincible
I've waited for change, but now I'm convinced
That this has to end

You can call it what you want
You can call it moving on
You know it's for the better
I know it's for the better

When you least thought I followed you
Followed you
Now I see that I can't follow you
Follow

If there's a chance
The light may follow you home
You know where to find me

You can call it what you want
You can call it moving on
You know it's for the better
I know it's for the better
