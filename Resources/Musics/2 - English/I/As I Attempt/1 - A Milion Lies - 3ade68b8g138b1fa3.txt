A MILION LIES

Cruel intention, cold demension, re-difying defenitions
Re-allowing penentration, 
stimulating novitaction

(Chorus)
Die, I look into the heart of a demon's eye
Going back in time, time
And I can't deny what's on her mind
What's on her mind?

(Hook 2x)
Just leave me, deceive me
Take out my heart and please me
Will never, return here
Won't die and I won't burn here

(Verse 2)
Souls invating, incarnating
Death awaits, it's still awaiting
Ask for answers they're evading
Lovely world of bitter hating

(Break)

And if I told you a milion lies would you still believe me

Die, I look into the heart of a demon's eye
Going back in time, time
And I can't deny what's on her mind
What's on her mind?

Just leave me, deceive me
Take out my heart and please me
Will never, return here
Won't die and I won't burn here
