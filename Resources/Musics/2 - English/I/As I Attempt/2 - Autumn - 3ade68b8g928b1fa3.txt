AUTUMN

(Intro)
She's a wreck with dirt on her face
Her life's a mess, a lost case
She's nervous an endless chase
It's worthless, a sealed fate

(hook)
This autumn wasn't met for you
You won't take this one too
This time you stand acused
This autumn won't be used by you

(chorus)
Take away these memories
This autumn's just to much for me
And as I sing for remedy
I feel them fade away so clean

(Verse 1)
I open my heart for her
Is this what she returns?
Cold rust dripping cold pain
Memories from blood stains
2x

(chorus)
Take away these memories
This autumn's just to much for me
And as I sing for remedy
I feel them fade away so clean

(bridge)
Fear, Hate, Destroy, Repeat

(verse 2)
So when you're not here
And I fear that you're not near
I won't feel any shame
I won't feel the smallest pain

But some times I think of you
And theres not much that I could do
I know you never felt this way
So I just get along with my day

(chorus)
Take away these memories
This autumn's just to much for me
And as I sing for remedy
I feel them fade away so clean

(hook)
This autumn wasn't met for you
You won't take this one too
This time you stand acused
This autumn won't be used by you

(chorus)
Take away these memories
This autumn's just to much for me
And as I sing for remedy
I feel them fade away so clean
