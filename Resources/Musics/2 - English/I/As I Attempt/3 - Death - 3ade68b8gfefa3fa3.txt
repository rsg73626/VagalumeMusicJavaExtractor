DEATH

(hook)
Fake: people that you hate, everything they say
Can you feel it rise; blowing up inside; taking over
mind
Left turns; looks to.. rise again boy
Crimes; what the fuck is right?
Join the other side, repeat.
Rise; blowing up inside taking over mind
Left turns; looks to.. rise again boy

(verse 1)
Chain it up, fuck it up. Live to thrive.
Fucking survive: burn.
Hold it down, throw it out. Live to die
Die to try: burn
Chain it up, fuck it up. Live to thrive.
Fucking survive: burn.
Hold it down, throw it out. Live to die.
Die to live, we live to die!

(chorus)
You're raping your fucking mind.
You can't see; you won't survive.

(hook)

(verse 2)
The world is dying, your children are crying.
Hope; lost; fucking unhuman.
The world is dying, your children are crying.
Hope; lost; Die to live we live to die!

(chorus)
