USELESS

If I was to listen to all
Of the things you told me
Oh so lonely I would feel forever more
If I was to say all
The wonderful phrases you throw me
Would you hold me tell me I'm all you adore?
Running around all the sights
And the sounds overthrow me
Oh so lonely in the city of all open-eyes
All the words that pretend
To be heard over-loath me
They control me, too much matter over mind

'cause I'm all to the useless
Totally stupid now (x2)

Cause I'm all to the useless
Healthy and putrid now
I can try to use my head
But it's not
No it's not
In my heart

If I have to succeed
Then I'll desperately need an opinion
All my thinking won't ammount too much long
Needless to say
I'm a terrible waste of existance
Keep your distance
It's a long, long way to fall

Cause I'm all to the useless
Healthy and putrid now
Yeah, I'm all to the useless
Healthy and putrid now
Well I can try to use my head
But it's not
No it's not
In my heart

No, no it's not
No it's not
In my heart
(in my heart)
In my heart
(in my heart)
