BLACK LABEL

It's time to drain the bottle again
Embrace a new damnation
We'll burn it down so hide your kids
Drink, destroy, repeat

There's no end, we're the black labels
No one here is safe

The road ends so suddenly
No trace of salvation
Take a breath, chug it down
Drink, destroy, repeat

There's no end, we're the black labels
No one here is safe
Living on the edge, with a black label
Tattooed on our hands
