TO FEEL ALIVE

Like a dream, the tree of life
Covers me and dulls my eyes
I fall asleep a thousand nights before I wake

Rising towards the sun
A voice whispers I'm the only one
Who will teach us how to keep
The vows we make

When the stars start to shine
The gods above are smiling in the night
Like spark to a flame
Feel it as my fear begins to fade

Free to rise again
Hand in hand against all odds
We'll overcome
Together we are one
For the first time in this life
Don't have to fight to feel alive

Love Unnerves my limbs
I fall into the water
Spirit free from care
as beauty wakes

As my hope comes alive
A feverish embrace that I can't hide
Like spark to a flame
Feel it in my heart that this won't fade

Free to rise again
Hand in hand against all odds
We'll overcome
Together we are one
For the first time in this life
Don't have to fight to feel alive

Up Down, Up Down
Up Down, Up Down
Just Believe, Just Believe

Free to rise again
Hand in hand against all odds
We'll overcome
The Future we've begun
For the first time in this life
Don't have to fight to feel alive
