TEMPTRESS

She lives in marble halls
The Temptress
Behind those castle walls she waits in silence
For you to lose yourself in her siren's song
and then she's gone

And in the night you'll hear her whisper softly
Words you can't repeat
You find yourself in a sea of love
With nothing but the stars above

Awake! It's dangerous
Oh, she's a temptress
Maybe if you catch her
She'll sweep you off your feet
And you know if she asks you to
Nothing's gonna stop you
Oh oh oh she's a temptress

Your dreams are built upon a rock of ages
A story that's rewritten on blank pages
The hunt is in your blood
There's nothing to be done
Until you've won

You pray to god that if he brings you to her
Til eternity you'll cherish her

Awake! It's dangerous
Oh, she's a temptress
Maybe if you catch her
She'll sweep you off your feet
And you know if she asks you to
Nothing's gonna stop you
Oh oh oh she's a temptress

You pray to god that if he brings you to her
Til eternity you'll cherish her
The Temptress
You pray to god that she'll never roam
Then you take her in your arms
And it feels like home
The Temptress

Awake! It's dangerous
Oh, she's a temptress
Maybe if you catch her
She'll sweep you off your feet
And you know if she asks you to
Nothing's gonna stop you
Oh oh oh she's a temptress
