NAH NAH

Fed up of excuses
Thereâ€™s nothing more to say
Sands of your patience have surely drained away
Backed into a corner built of my design
Peer into the future entwined is yours and mine
I know it 

Nah nah nah nah nah 

Although we realise it
I hope itâ€™s not too late
Begginâ€™ all the pardons please donâ€™t lock the gate
A spiderâ€™s web was woven full of much deceit
I know you re exhausted too much to repeat
I know this canâ€™t go on if things remain the same
Drastic change is needed, itâ€™s driving me insane 

Nah nah nah nah nah 

Iâ€™m too embarrassed to look you in the eye
You stuck your neck out, gosh at least a thousand times
Thereâ€™s no more courage just to ask the reason why
Why, why, why?
Talking about a real thing, talking about a real thing
