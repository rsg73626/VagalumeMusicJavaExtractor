WHAT HAPPENED TO YA, PT. 1

Full of decision laden with choice
Cast in a picture that is better than most
And while you work on your big master plan
The pawn's around you were not part of the plan
Extended visions distorted dreams
All based on image, it's not all that it seems
You'll walk on water if they told you they lied
There's just one problem, you just missed the tide

What happened to ya
Did you change your mind
What happened to ya
We were one of a kind
Did you bury your face
Like an ostrich
You can't seem to hold on
You can't seem to get it on, get it on, get it on

Cast iron illusions, feelings locked in a safe
I saw you running to your own secret place
So very trusting of those people around
A new safe haven is the place that you've found
Extended visions distorted dreams
All based on image, it's not all that it seems
You'll walk on water if they told you they lied
There's just one problem, you've just missed the tide

What happened to ya
Did you change your mind
What happened to ya
We were one of a kind
Did you bury your face
Like an ostrich
You can't seem to hold on
You can't seem to get it on, get it on, get it on
