CAN'T SEE ME

Down by the river side I waited there for you
Take you back in time
Youâ€™re in suspension, hey I caught you
You cannot hide, itâ€™s all inside, easy
She knows you canâ€™t see me 

Yes Mr Miser, Mr, Mr Mystery sheâ€™s saying to me
Saying he canâ€™t see you, he canâ€™t free you, he canâ€™t be you
He just wanna be you
He needs a dealer as a healer 

Iâ€™ve seen that expression on your face
I could have sent you to that place
Expression canâ€™t see me 

Yes, Iâ€™m reminded of those days
Take you back in time, itâ€™s all unite
Here comes a reason to my rhyme
The man used to fly, he used to fly easy
But know you canâ€™t see me 

I know mine, mine know me
I can sail upon your sea
I can sail upon your sea so easy she knows you canâ€™t see me 

Iâ€™ve seen that expression on your face
I could have sent you to that place
I know you canâ€™t see me
I know you canâ€™t see me
