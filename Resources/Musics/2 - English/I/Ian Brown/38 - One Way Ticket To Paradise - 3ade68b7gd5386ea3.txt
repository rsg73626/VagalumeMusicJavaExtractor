ONE WAY TICKET TO PARADISE

all this creation
many many roads to your destination
none of these warmongers can really talk at all
so we'll see all that glitter isn't always gold

threw a dice came up as seven
now i'm on my way to heaven

two situations never are the same
no two situations
im in seventh heaven 
my place in the sun
where I'l stay until i get to kingdom come

all this temptation 
all this desire
this celebration baptism of fire

threw a dice came up as seven
now i'm on my way to heaven

im on a way way ticket to paradise
i got a one way ticket to paradise

threw a dice came up as seven
now i'm on my way to heaven

im on a way way ticket to paradise
i got a one way ticket to paradise
