GETTIN' HIGH

I could have found you if I wanted
I wouldn't even have to try
Saved you if I longed it
But you didn't wanna see me by
You were gettin' high
You were gettin' high
I could have found you if I wanted
Wouldn't even have to try
Saved you if I'd longed it
You didn't wanna see me by
You were gettin' high
Gettin high
I could astound you if I wanted
Wouldn't even have to try
Saved you if I longed it
But you didn't wanna see me by
You were gettin' high
You were gettin' high
