SOLARIZED

Her heart gets broken
It's something she can't hide
She's cut like a diamond
From a mine as deep as time
The words that she's spoken
Have energised my mind
A sheer elevation so like eagles high we'll glide

Hot love it smoulders
It's something she can't hide
A manifestation of a force as old as time
Now morning has broken
And solarized my eyes
Her sheer dispensation
Says like eagles high we'll glide

Solarized in the sunrise
Rise with the sunrise
Soul rise in the sunrise
Solarized in the sunrise
Rise with the sunrise
Soul rise in the sunrise
The light that she lives for in the dark she'll always find
