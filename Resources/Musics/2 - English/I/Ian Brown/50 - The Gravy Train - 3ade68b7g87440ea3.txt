THE GRAVY TRAIN

Way a little baby wraps the hand around your finger 
Sunshine on your face, in the first dawn light 
Way she waits to let the moment linger 
Way the future`s always bring surprise 

It aint cocaine running through your veins 
Blue caviar on the gravy train 
It aint cocaine as you sip champagne 
As you toast hightimes on your Gravy Train 
So many vampires in the night 
All of the riches in this time, I know you`re mine 

Waiting for the lightening so exciting after the thunder 
Twinkle in your eyes, the starlight shines 
The diamond in your mind is cut from wonder 
I know how your feeling and you`re feeling fine 

It aint cocaine running through your veins 
Blue caviar on the gravy train 
It aint cocaine as you sip champagne 
As you toast hightimes on your Gravy Train 
So many vampires in the night 
All of the riches in this time, I know you`re mine 

I know you`re mine 
And we got all the time in the world
