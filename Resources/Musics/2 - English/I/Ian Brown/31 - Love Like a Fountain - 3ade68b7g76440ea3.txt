LOVE LIKE A FOUNTAIN

I could climb every mountain
For your love is like a fountain
Let it shower down over me
Soak me to the bone
Pour all over me
Am I coming home?
I could climb every mountain
For your love is like a fountain
Let it shower down over me
Soak me to the bone yeah
Pour all over me
Am I coming home yeah?
I could glide across the ocean
For your love rubs like a lotion
Shower down over me
Soak me to the bone
Pour all over me
Am I coming home?
Your love is like a fountain
For your love
It's like a fountain
