GOODBYE TO THE BROKEN

You couldn't have planned it
I don't understand it
Don't know why you went and threw it all away
Yesterday
We had it all and you threw it all away
I don't know why you couldn't stay
Yesterday

You should have believed it
You would have recived it yeah
Hello to the woken
Goodbye to all the broken
Word is spoken yeah

You couldn't have planned it
I don't understand it
Don't know why you went and threw it all away
Yesterday
We had it all and you threw it all away
I don't know why you couldn't stay
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday

Hello to the woken
Goodbye to all the broken
Word is spoken yeah
You were all wrapped up in a blizzard
Coke choked up to the gizzard
On a snowy summer day

You were all wrapped up in a blizzard
Coke choked up to the gizzard
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
