ICE COLD CUBE

Brother fire I got to verse with you
I just ran into this ice cold cube
Thought its ways could freeze me out
So I left it melting there no doubt hey
I suggest you think again my friend
Love is a circle with no end
A message given heaven sent
I've seen you cause your own descent (hey)

I smell a fox all alone at night
Ten thousand footsteps out of sight
I turned your darkness into light
Get down she'll blind you
Get down, she'll hypnotise you
She'll see clean right inside your plan
And turn to say that ain't no man

Sister fire, I feel your glow
Walk on true cause they don't know
Sister ice I felt your chill
It must have been a bitter pill

I smell a fox all alone at night
Ten thousand footsteps out of sight
I turned your darkness into light
Get down she'll blind you
Get down, she'll hypnotise you
She'll see clean right inside your plan
And turn to say that ain't no man
