LIONS

Iâ€™m alone in the country
Took a walk in the country
All alone in the country 

Blade of grass in the country
Sour mash in the country
All the cash in the country 

There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England no, no, no 

Iâ€™ll call you home
Then you start delivering
Taking my time then you start your quibbling
Now I know your meddling, youâ€™re still back pedalling
I should have quit you a long long time ago 

There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England no, no, no 

There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England no, no, no 

There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England
There are no lions in England no, no, no
