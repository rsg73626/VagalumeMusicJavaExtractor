NORTHERN LIGHTS

I love to see you free and dancing 
You are my angel and my plaything 
Your many ways have set my heart ablaze 
It`s you who puts my soul in ecstacy 

You are my angel and my plaything 
Your motion I find so entrancing 
Shall I stand next to your fire? 
Smoke rings raise higher and higher 
You are my angel and my plaything 

If I`m your rose you are my sun and rain 
And the northern lights will shine again and again 
If I`m your rose you are my sun and rain 

In the heat of the night in the light of the day as is given can also be taken taken away 
In the heat of the night in the light of the day I remove anything that can stand in our way 
I`ll be your rose that sets your heart ablaze 

If I`m your rose, you are my sun and rain 
And the northern lights will shine again and again 
If I`m your rose, you are my sun and rain 
And the northern lights will shine again and again 
If I`m your rose, you are my sun and rain
