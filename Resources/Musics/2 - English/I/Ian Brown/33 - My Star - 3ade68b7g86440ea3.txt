MY STAR

Space exploration for nuclear stations
NASA corrupters, jewelled abductors
Space exploration, excursion to the stars
On a military mission on a military mission to Mars
I'll see you in my star
I'll see you in my star 

Solar system bases, the new world order
Lust for space dust, forming galaxy borders
Never seeking new life, only planning war
Sending satellites at new height, satellites to destroy
I'll see you in my star
I'll see you in my star 

Space exploration for nuclear stations
Nasa corrupters, jewelled abductors
Space exploration, excursion to the stars
On a military mission on a military mission to Mars
To boldly go where no man's ever been before
Astronauts the new conquistadores
See you in my star
I'll see you in my star (x3)
