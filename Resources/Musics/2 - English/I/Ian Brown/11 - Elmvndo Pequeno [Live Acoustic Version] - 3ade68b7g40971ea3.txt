ELMVNDO PEQUENO [LIVE ACOUSTIC VERSION]

What do you want 
What do you want 
When the world is so big and yet so small at the same time 
What do you want 
What do you want 
When the world is so big and yet so small at the same time 
What can i do for you that has everything 
I can only love you 
I can only love you 
When the days have passed 
And the night has begun 
As the stars start to fall from the sky 
I can only love you 
As the sun and the rain come together to create a rainbow 
I can only love you
