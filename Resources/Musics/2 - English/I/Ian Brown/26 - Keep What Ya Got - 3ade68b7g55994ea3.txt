KEEP WHAT YA GOT

Yesterday came suddenly. 
Tomorrow will we see? 
Today now you’re at the wheel. 
I’ll ask “how does it feel?” 
Yesterday when heaven's gates I contemplate. 
They seem so far. 
Today they ain’t so far away and almost seem a drag. 

Keep what yer got by giving it all away. 
Keep what yer got by giving it all away. 
Keep what yer got, hold it don’t stop. 
Keep what yer got, by giving it all away. 

When your halo slips for good you’ll have to wear your hood. 
Good to feel the breeze of fear on all the cynics. 
And you mimic all you losers all abusers wasting all my precious energy. 

Keep what yer got by giving it all away. 
Keep what yer got by giving it all away. 
Keep what yer got, hold it don’t stop. 
Keep what yer got, by giving it all away. 

Remember where you came from. 
Sister she told ya on a rainy day. 
It’s said that heaven holds a place for all of those who pray. 
And if you don’t believe in agony then you don’t care anyway. 
Nobody or nothing’s ever getting in your way. 
Even as you cradle on but don’t think you’ll be long. 
No-ones gonna notice if yer never right or wrong. 
And if you and your next neighbour, yeah you don’t quite get along. 
No-ones gonna notice if your singing anyway. 
Those not coming with with the few well then they gotta pay.
