SHADOW OF A SAINT

Sat in the grass, up on a hill 
The air so still, you came to me to say 
"I`ll take away your tears, and stay with you for years" 

Sat in the grass, up on a hill 
The air so still, you come to me to say 
"I will wash away your fears, and stay with you for years" 

I lay beneath the wings of an angel 
I`m standing in the shadow of a saint 
All roads are long and no one can deny them 
Everything will come to those who wait 

And in the time it takes a man to fall 
I`ll stand up & take it all, I`ll take you all with me 
Put you on your seat 

I lay beneath the wings of an angel 
I`m standing in the shadow of a saint 
All roads are long and no one can deny them 
Everything will come to those who wait 

I`ll stay beneath the wings of an angel 
Im standing in the shadow of a saint 
I`lls tay beneath the wings of an angel 
IM standing in the shadow of a saint 
I`ll stay beneath the wings of an angel 
I`ll stay beneath the wings of an angel 
I`m standing in the shadow of a saint 

I`ll stay beneath the wings of an angel
