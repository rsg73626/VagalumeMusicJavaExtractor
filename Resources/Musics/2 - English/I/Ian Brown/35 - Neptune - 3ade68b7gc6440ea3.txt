NEPTUNE

Ladies and gentlemen
On our left is Neptune
Wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace
This grace can help you wander
Wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace
The smile on a little childs face
Ladies and gentlemen
On our right we have Mars
Wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace
This grace can help you wander
Wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace
The smile on a little childs face
Wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace
Ladies and gentlemen
On our left is Neptune
