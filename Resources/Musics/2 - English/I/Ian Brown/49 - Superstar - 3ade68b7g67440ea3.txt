SUPERSTAR

Hey, I see you from afar
You're a living superstar, that's what you are yeah
Hey, I see you from afar
You're a living superstar
You are yeah

Some people living like they won't get very far
Some people living like they're living life on Mars
The naked eye can only see so many stars
Some people living like they're living life on Mars

Hey, I see you from afar
You're a living superstar, that's what you are yeah
Hey, I see you from afar
You're a living superstar
You are yeah

I'd sooner eat the snake than have to eat the sand
The desert wind creates Stone Roses underland

All things shall be revealed, all crazy laws shall be revealed
All things shall be revealed, all crazy laws shall be revealed
All things shall be revealed, all crazy laws shall be revealed
All things shall be revealed, all crazy laws shall be revealed
You're a living superstar (Repeat to fade)
