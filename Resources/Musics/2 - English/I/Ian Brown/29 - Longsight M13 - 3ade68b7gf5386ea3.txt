LONGSIGHT M13

Here's your gift wrapped easter egg
You're scented like a rose
Got so many dreams
I think my head might explode

Let the stars shine on
Until the break of dawn
Let the stars shine on

Seen so many happy faces
Waving back at me
Been so many places
Even rich don't ever get to see
Got ex-friends in a frenzy
Green with envy jealous eyes
With far to many demons now
Yo ever exorcise

Let the stars shine on
Until the break of dawn
Let the stars shine on
And let her move, move like a queen
Of Longsight M13

You and I
Now we are together
Love will fly
Love will fly
We will live forever
You don't have to justify

Let the stars shine on
Until the break of dawn
Let the stars shine on
And let her move, move like a queen
Of Longsight M13
