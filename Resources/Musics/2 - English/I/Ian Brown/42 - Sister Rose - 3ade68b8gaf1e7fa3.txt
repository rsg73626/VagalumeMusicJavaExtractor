SISTER ROSE

Free That Girl,
The One That Glows She Knows,
She Rules The World,

Free That Girl,
The One That Glows She Knows,
She Rules The World,

She Said Call Me Sister Rose,
I'm At War With All These Posers And These Frauds,
I Want Â‘Em Out,
Let Freedom Reign,
Let Hope Stand Firm On Fields Of Doubt,

Then She Led Me By The Hand,
And Took Me To The Promised Land,

Free That Girl, The One That Knows She Glows, She Rules The World,

She Said I'm Just Like A Rose,
I'm Beautiful And I Can Hurt You With My Thorns,
Don't Squeeze Too Tight,
Â‘Cos I Can Blow Up In Ya Face Like Dynamite,
