GOLDEN GAZE

Through the haze of the smoke in the room
I caught your golden gaze
I knew there were better days
With the rays of the sun through the roof
I caught your golden gaze
Knew there were better days
Your golden gaze
Golden gaze your golden gaze
Your golden gaze
Star spangled shades shade your eyes
But could never hide your golden gaze
Your golden gaze
Red summer skies bright your smile
And could never hide your golden gaze
Your golden gaze
In the dawn of the morning rain
I caught your golden gaze
Golden days
Your golden gaze
Through the haze of the smoke in the room
I caught your golden gaze
I knew there were better days
Your golden gaze
Your golden gaze
