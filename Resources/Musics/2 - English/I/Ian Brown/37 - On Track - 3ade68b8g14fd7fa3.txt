ON TRACK

You can't erase or re-arrange
You can't rewind you can't go back
You gotta get your life on track
Nor pontificate nor contemplate your fate
We're all walking in the dark
Just pray you're gonna get to heavens gate

Just as life is for living
So love is for giving
Life's no simple situation
There's the added complication
That the reason that we're here nobody knows
In all creation

You can't erase or re-arrange
You can't rewind you can't go back
You gotta get your life on track
Nor pontificate nor contemplate your fate
We're all walking in the dark
Just pray you're gonna get to heavens gate

Just as life is for living
So love is for giving
Life's no simple situation
There's the added complication
That the reason that we're here nobody knows
In all creation

You can't erase or re-arrange
You can't rewind you can't go back
You gotta get your life on track
Nor pontificate nor contemplate your fate
We're all walking in the dark
Just pray you're gonna get to heavens gate
You lit a fuse
You can't return
You might get burned you can't go back
You gotta beck your life on track
Reactivate and celebrate the day
Don't hesitate to step over all obstructions
In your way

See that life is for living
So love is for giving
Life's no simple situation
There's the added complication
That the reason that we're here
Nobody knows in all creation
