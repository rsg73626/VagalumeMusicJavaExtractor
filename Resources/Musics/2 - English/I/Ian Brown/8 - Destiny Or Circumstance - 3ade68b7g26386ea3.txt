DESTINY OR CIRCUMSTANCE

It was when you smiled
And from the corner of your eye
I could see the sunrise shone on for miles

I've seen it all
I've never seen anything
So beautiful as you you're so gracile

The steps you take
And all the love you make
I can hear your words so clear ring out for miles
I've seen your tall
I've seen you without anything at all
No one can hold a candle to you
I'm just trying to reach you
Love your smile

Is it the questions or the answers
That'll lead you to the Lord of the dance?
I admire your style
Love your smile
Cross the street
Is it your destiny or circumstance
Leads you to the lord of the dance?
I admire your style
Love your smile
Cross the street
See you using all your guile
So our eyes our eyes would meet
Soul arise love your smile
Soul arise
Love your smile
