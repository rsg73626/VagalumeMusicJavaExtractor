CORPSES IN THEIR MOUTHS

You tell lies when the truth will do
You are the social chameleon what on earth we gonna do with you?
Slip your neck into a rope, show me a smile
Youâ€™d run a mile
Then you are free, so whereâ€™s the goal?
Whereâ€™s the style? You want the dough
Got dead sea scrolls for you and your women too 

Sheâ€™s got corpses in her mouth
Still sheâ€™s holding hands with you
Itâ€™s cut like crystal chandeliers
Iâ€™ll shine like diamonds in her ears 

She smokes crack, itâ€™s off the beaten track
You are the social chameleon, you change to suit the people around you
Itâ€™s like the waves that hit the shore
You cannot stand the force of law
Look man, I know it from your nature
Hit the deck 

Hit the deck, as the creator
Got dead sea scrolls for you and your women too 

Sheâ€™s got corpses in her mouth 
Still sheâ€™s holding hands with you 
Itâ€™s cut like crystal chandeliers 
Iâ€™ll shine like diamonds in her ears
