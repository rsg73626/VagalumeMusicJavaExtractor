BUBBLES

Mercy mountain crevices hold treasures buried deep 
A blizzard or rain can`t wash any memories that you keep 
I just came in on the banana boat, got born only yesterday 
Came down through the stars, I landed from Mars 
Make my way through the Milky Way 
Last I saw you metamorphasized, chrysalis into a butterfly 
You opened your wings, such beautiful things and then I saw you fly away so high 
A birds eye view up to the stratosphere, all the universe reflected in your eyes 
I came to despise, your seek through the skies, your web of lies, and all the empty words you say 
I see you like a bubble in the air 
But bubbles can rise 
But pop when they reach the top 
I see you like a bubble in the air 
But bubbles can rise 
Last I saw you change inside, a chrysalis into a butterfly 
You open your wings, such beautiful things and then I watch you fly away to die 
I just came in on the banana boat, got born only yesterday 
Came down through the stars, I landed from Mars, made my way through the Milky Way 
I see you like a bubble in the air 
But bubbles can rise 
But pop when you reach the top 
I see you like a bubble in the air 
But bubbles can rise 
But pop when they reach the top 
I see you like a bubble in the air 
But bubbles can rise 
But pop when they reach the top
