HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS

Home Is Where the Heart Is
I'm so glad you've found your way
And should you find yourself in disarray
I got a place in my heart where you can stay
I made a space in my heart where you may wanna lay

Home Is Where the Heart Is
Thoughts of free life birds wake up a sing

Home Is Where the Heart Is
I'm so glad you're here to stay
And should you find yourself ever drifting away
I made a space my heart where you can stay
I saved a place in my heart where you may wanna lay

Cause theres always gonna be another day
