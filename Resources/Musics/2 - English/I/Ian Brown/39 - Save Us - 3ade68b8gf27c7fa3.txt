SAVE US

Until I draw my last breath on this earth
And death it takes me as is promised from your birth
I know I got so much living to do
I'll be so long asleep the lord I'll pray my soul to keep

A place to stay the lord shall grant me sanctuary
For peace of mind the lord I'll ask for sanity
Seek and I shall find a place of rest for sanctity

Save us from imbeciles who think they rule the world
Save us from hypocrites whose twisted plans unfurl
Save us from warmongers who'd bring on Armageddon
Save us from all of those whose eyes are closed
To the plight of the African child

We get along it's all about the chemistry
Up there way beyond the mere exchange of pleasantries
Please don't she'd no tears it's all about the energy

Save us from imbeciles who think they rule the world
Save us from hypocrites whose twisted plans unfurl
Save us from warmongers who'd bring on Armageddon
Save us from all of those whose eyes are closed
To the plight of the African child

A place to stay the lord shall grant me sanctuary
For peace of mind the lord I'll ask for sanity
Seek and I shall find a place of rest for sanctity

Save us from imbeciles who think they rule the world
Save us from hypocrites whose twisted plans unfurl
Save us from warmongers who'd bring on Armageddon
Save us from all of those whose eyes are closed
To the plight of the African child

And so when all is said and done
I'll count my blessings spread my wings and fly, fly home
