ME AND YOU FOREVER

Good day to you my friend
Me and you forever
We will be together
Until the very end
And if there is not end my friend
Through fire we'll walk and start again
My precious friend

Come into the lions den
We'll see what you're made of then
Step out in the morning light
Come in where the lights so bright
Come into the lions den
We'll see what you're made of then
Step out in the morning light
And see my friend
You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
Yeah you might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
With a gun up in your hand
All your heat is canned
What a trip before the fall

And so it is my friend
Me and you forever
So sure we'll meet again
My precious friend

Come into the lions den
We'll see what you're made of then
Step out in the morning light
And see my friend
You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
Somebody point the finger
Yeah you might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
Just to put you in the picture
Somebody point the finger

You might as well be hanged for a sheep
As for a lamb

The youth been demonised
The young criminalised
By society despised for being young
Neither cherished nor recognised
Lionized or even prized
By their govermental guide to being free
Just you and me
