ALL ABLAZE

Caught you in a ring of fire
All surround me, such a blaze
Got you in a ring of fire
Lift me as you, say my name

Who you gonna get to bring you water,
When your well runs dry
What you gonna gonna tell your little daughter,
Is the reason that her daddy makes her cry

Caught you in a ring of fire
Happy days are all ablaze
Happy days in a ring of fire
Lift me as you, say my name

Who you gonna get to bring you water,
as your well runs dry
What you gonna tell your little daughter,
Is the reason,
That daddy makes her cry

Sayin Jesus never died at crucifiction,
So Mother Mary never suffered so much pain
Masqueraders paintin pictures flip the scriptures
Dont even know his name

I.... I say the same again, happy days are here and...
Bells.... just dont stop ringin in the rain...
Happy days are,
All Ablaze

All Ablaze

I.... I say the same again, happy days are here and...
Bells.... just dont stop ringin in the rain...
Happy days are,
All Ablaze
All Ablaze

Caught you in a ring of fire
Caught you in a ring of fire
