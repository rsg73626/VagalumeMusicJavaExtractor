FREE MY WAY

Jingle jangle here's the jailer
Heaven's here right now on earth
Legal wrangle Holy Papers
You gotta know your worth
I'm gonna free my way
Gonna be my way
Wonder can you see me laughing in this place
Jingle jangle here's the jailer
Heaven's here right now on earth
Gonna free my way
Be my way
Wonder can you see me laughing in this place
Be my way
Got to free my way
Wonder can you see me laughing in this place
Thou shalt not bear false witness
Against they neighbour
I was your neighbour
So now you're in danger
