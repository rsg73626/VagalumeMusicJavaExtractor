WHISPERS

You`re waking in the morning 
Spent the night trying to bond with the moon 
She never loved you 
Just a whole wild, two scene, chopped up, splitscreen, dream machine 
An alibi for lonesome dreams 

I hear a lot of rumours 
I hear a lot of stone cold rumours 
I hear a lot of whispers 
I hear a lot of easy talking, given whispers 
About you 

She only wanted you 
For what you could do to get her picture in a sunday magazine 
She`s just a whole wild, two scene, choppped up, splitscreen, dream machine 
An alibi for lonesome dreams 

I hear a lot of rumours 
I hear a lot of stone cold rumours 
I hear a lot of whispers 
I hear a lot of easy talking, given whispers 
About you 

I hear a lot of rumours 
I hear a lot of stone cold rumours 
I hear a lot of whispers 
I hear a lot of easy talking, given whispers 

What a pleasure it is to receive 
And what a God given gift it is to the air that we breathe 

I hear a lot of rumours 
I hear a lot of stone cold rumours 
I hear a lot of whispers 
I hear a lot of easy talking, given whispers 
About you 

I hear a lot of rumours 
I hear a lot of whispers 
And they`re all about you
