ETERNAL FLAME

Beauty's only skin deep
And the body is a shell
If somebody shares a secret
Then you're not supposed to tell

Everything is changes
Nothing stays the same
No one can extinguish this eternal hallowed flame

Some men spring surprises
And some are good as gold
It's gonna take until hell freezes
Before I'd ever sell my soul

Everything is changes
Nothing stays the same
No one can extinguish this eternal hallowed flame

Stay close be free
Free like the fishes in the see
Stay close together
Be as one
The works of wonder still to come

Those who say they know so
Well they don't know a thing
'Cause those who know don't say so
It's the joy of love to bring

Everything is changes
Nothing stays the same
No one can extinguish this eternal hallowed flame

Stay close be free
Free like the fishes in the see
Stay close together
Be as one
The works of wonder still to come
Another day has just begun
The treasures of the night to come
The victory already won
The works of wonder to be done yeah

Everything is changes
Nothing stays the same
No one can extinguish this eternal hallowed flame
