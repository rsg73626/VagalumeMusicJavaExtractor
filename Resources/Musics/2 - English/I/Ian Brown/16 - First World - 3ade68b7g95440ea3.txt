FIRST WORLD

Swansong over the rooftops
Call to the kid next door
Let it be proclaimed in the wind and the rain
Gotta do that
Do you really think so
Do you really think so
Hope that the light of the first world
Won't dark the light of the third world
Wash the darkness from your eyes
It's time to let your nature rise
Roses in the garden
Hummingbirds and butterflies
