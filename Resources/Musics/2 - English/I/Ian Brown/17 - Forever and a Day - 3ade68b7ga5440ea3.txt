FOREVER AND A DAY

What you gonna do when you just found forever ?
Where you gonna go when you cant get it together ?

Forever and a day

A fly gets caught upon a spiders web
The snake still has another skin to shed

Forever and a day

Is it all a dream or have you just found forever ?
Get it all together, get like birds of a feather

Forever and a day

The truth be told
You're more than stones and rings of gold
You can't be bought or sold
What'chya gonna do when you just found forever ?
Where you gonna get to when you get it together ?

Each and everyday

Forever and a day
