UPSIDE DOWN

Wars and Famine 
Plauges and pestillence 
There is an answer to be found 
If all thats meant to be was meant to be 
I know the world is upside down 
I know the world is upside down 
I know the world is upside down 

A desert rose cascading waterfalls 
The sands of time will blow my mind 
The real wealth to hold is with your health 
You were beside me all around 
I know the world is upside down 
I know the world is upside down 

Seven percent own eighty four percent 
Of all the wealth on earth 
Oil is the spice to make a man 
Forget man's wealth 
Right here on earth 
Upon this turf 
Earth is spinning round 
I know the world is upside down This line 
Is upside down
