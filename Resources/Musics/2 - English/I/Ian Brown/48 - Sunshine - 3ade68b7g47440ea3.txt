SUNSHINE

Is the sun yes
The size of a beach ball
The earth shall be the size of a sweet, sweet pea
Let it be so it goes blow your nose
Yeah, yeah, yeah I hear you, I hear you calling
Electric lightning lights the night until the morning
I caught you stalling on me every day, no way 

Itâ€™s the moon yes
That turns the tides
On the ocean bed a starfish starts to slide
Into the sand the way it planned right on time 

I can see the sunshine in the rain
Itâ€™s all be done before, thatâ€™s what she says
I can see you got the sunshine in the rain
