DEEP PILE DREAMS

Iâ€™ve seen you
Youâ€™ve never been yourself
Thatâ€™s what you pay your shrink for
Youâ€™re mean, you thinking of no one but yourself
What do you think all the loveâ€™s for? 

I only ever wanted the one with the flag
But all you ever wanted was a sixty dollar bag
And a cheap limousine for your deep pile dream
On the highway 

Shut your mouth and bend down low
Sit back and watch the flowers grow
People change but it was never a game
Go wash your face and your hands cause we all look the same 

I only ever wanted the one with the flag
But all you ever wanted was a sixty dollar bag
And a cheap limousine for your deep pile dream
On the highway 

See no hear no, so why do you go and speak so
Talking pouring scorn on the bold
I closed the door on your cold breath wish
You went and gave your tongue to a devil on a dish 

I only ever wanted the one with the flag
But all you ever wanted was a sixty dollar bag
And a cheap limousine for your deep pile dream
On the highway 

I only ever wanted the one with the flag
But all you ever wanted was a sixty dollar bag
And a cheap limousine for your deep pile dream
