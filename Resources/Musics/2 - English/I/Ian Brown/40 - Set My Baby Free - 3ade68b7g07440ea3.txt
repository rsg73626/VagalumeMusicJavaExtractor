SET MY BABY FREE

Said he was man
What did he know?
Spent his time living in a casino
Never know
Couldn't get away, couldn't ever get it anyway
Couldn't ever level 'cause he's living like a devil
Hey you ugly people
I want you to set my baby free
Hey people
Set my baby free
Came upon a man
In tune with his libido
Took another's wife
To help him get to sleep
Couldn't get away, couldn't ever get it anyway
Couldn't ever level cause he's living like a devil
Hey you ugly people
I want you to set my baby free
Hey people
Set my baby free
When she turns to smile
And lights up from inside
Walking miles
And you ain't got nobody by your side
Hey ugly people
Set my Baby free
Hey you ugly people
I want you to set my baby free
When she turns to smile
And lights up from inside
Walking miles
You ain't got nobody
By your side
Hey people, set my baby free
Set my baby free
Set my baby free
