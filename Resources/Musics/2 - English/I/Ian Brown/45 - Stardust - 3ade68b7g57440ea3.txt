STARDUST

If you`re picking up a pen, imagining a sword 
If you think I`d never flown to the heights at which you soared 
Picking up a pen, its like picking up a spade 
To plant or sow a seed, or digging your own grave 
I`m made from stardust 
Like a planetary sun 
Same DNA as stardust 
Like an elephants trunk 
Is a snorkel full of water 
Picking up a pen, imagining a sword 
If you think I`d never flown to the heights to which you soared 
Picking up a pen, its like picking up a spade 
It`s a planet so it seems, or digging your own grave 
I`m made from stardust 
Like a planetary sun 
Same DNA as stardust 
Like an elephants trunk 
Is a snorkel full of water 
Is a snorkel full of water 
Who`ll feed the young `cause they`re starving 
In this beautiful world that you marvel in 
Who`d feed the young `cause they`re hungry 
In this beautiful world in that you live in for free 
Same DNA as stardust, carbonated to less 
Same DNA as stardust, from a time that has passed 
I`m made from stardust
