SHE CRIES

Without you her anguish grows
You're living with your life on hold
When all she wants is a little of your time
She doesn't want to cause you pain
Or make you feel that you're to blame
For all the hurt that she's known in her life
Don't you think some things in life
However hard are worth the fight
The story has gone on too long
She's getting tired no one's that strong
You must know that it is wrong
She√¨s spent her whole life at your door
Always hoping you would welcome her with open arms
But something always holds you back
The scars your heart bares from the past
Always keeping her from being there at your side
Chorus
And she cries, oh she cries
She cries, oh she cries
The love you have, only you can give
And this is what she needs
Until you learn to share your love
There will always be tears
