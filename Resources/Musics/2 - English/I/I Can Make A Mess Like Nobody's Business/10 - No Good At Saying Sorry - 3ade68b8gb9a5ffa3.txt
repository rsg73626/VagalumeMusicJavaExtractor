NO GOOD AT SAYING SORRY

What was I to say I'm already all alone,
And there's nothing here except a hole in the wall.
What was I to do and how should I know,
I was never good when times are changing.

One more chance
I'd never would react like this.
One more time
It'd be time enough to think about it.
And one last straw
Could be strong enough to make this work
Or throw away everything.

It's time that I go, I can sleep on the road,
It wont be soft but it will be on my own.
I'm sure that last time I couldn't have been wrong,
Besides I'm not good with saying sorry.

One more chance
I'd never would react like this.
One more time
It'd be time enough to think about it.
And one last straw
Could be strong enough to make this work
Or throw away everything.
(throw away everything)

Just one time is all it takes
One time is all it takes
(timing shows I needed to prove that I was)
Just one time is all it takes,
(strong enough to be on my own)
One time is all it takes
(so we're taking time with bad excuses)
Just one time is all it takes.
...got to show it to know that everything is all right.

One more chance
I'd never would react like this.
One more time
It'd be time enough to think about it.
And one last straw
Could be strong enough to make this work
Or throw away everything.

One more chance
I'd never would react like this.
One more time
It'd be time enough to think about it.
And one last straw
Could be strong enough to make this work
Or throw away everything.
