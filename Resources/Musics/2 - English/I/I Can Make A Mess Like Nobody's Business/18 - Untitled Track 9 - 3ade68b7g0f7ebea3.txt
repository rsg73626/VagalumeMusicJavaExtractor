UNTITLED TRACK 9

You're always in control, you never make a big deal. 
You always are your own, you never need someone to feel good.
For yourself. 
You always watch yourself, after everyone else. 
You never change shoe, because it's on the right foot. 

And we're all finding ways, to find ourselves. 
Through these, broken, fallen walls that we call, we call our own. 
And we're never looking away. 
Hopefully someday we can just stay young. 

I'm too afraid to talk, i never even curse... 
Well, i think them all the time. 
Is this the reason i'm so built, up inside? 
Dreams went off the screen, i save the world with my toys. 
I have another girl, for every adventure. 
Oh yeah, i try. but that's me. 

And we're all finding ways, to find ourselves. 
Through these, broken, fallen walls that we call, we call our own. 
And we're never looking away. 
Hopefully someday we can just stay young. 

Take a look, and see what you'll find. 
Maybe look and see who you'll find. 

And we're all finding ways, to find ourselves. 
Through these, broken, fallen walls that we call, we call our own. 
And we're never looking away. 
Hopefully someday we can just stay young.
