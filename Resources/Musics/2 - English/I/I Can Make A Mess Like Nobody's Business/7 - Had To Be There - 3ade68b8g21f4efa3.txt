HAD TO BE THERE

I hear the drips and drones of a nightmare
I let you slip in my head now I'm almost ready for
A night laced with oceans and hot air
Your mind's a cold crazy place now I'm almost ready for you

All I've been thinking all night is how I wanted to be there

And there's nothing I could say that can sway your eyes you had already faced it
While I'm draggin up the lines that you had be there
And there's nothing I can say that could change your mind you were already wasted
By thinking of the times that you'd rather be there
You had to be there

I say alright lets wake up from this nightmare
Its time to let it all go and just hold on tight and ride it
Back the same way that it came here
Where we're lyin awake prayin for the wave to take us

All I've been thinking all night is how I wanted to be there

And there's nothing I could say that can sway your eyes you had already faced it
While I'm draggin up the lines that you had be there
And there's nothing I can say that could change your mind you were already wasted
By thinking of the times that you'd rather be there
You had to be there

Old lines they fade with time in the salty air
Those cold nights where feelings change in the summer air
Old lines they fade with time in the salty air
Those cold nights where feelings change in the summer air

And there's nothing I could say that can sway your eyes you had already faced it
While I'm draggin up the lines that you had be there
And there's nothing I can say that could change your mind you were already wasted
By thinking of the times that you'd rather be there
You had to be there.
