THE BEST HAPPINESS MONEY CAN BUY

Time goes by, 
And we watch our lives,
As they're sadly slipping away.
Alone, we cry.

So follow that tune quickly 
Or you'll lose the melody you never heard 
When you were young you didn't care.
It's the one that stole your fathers pride,
That mighty mighty dollar sign.
These are the things that matter now,
So sing along and be...

Prepared to jump,
When the ship has sunk,
And you're slowly watching it drown.
Alone, you cry.

So follow that tune quickly 
Or you'll lose the melody you never heard 
When you were young you didn't care.
It's the one that stole your fathers pride,
That mighty mighty dollar sign.
These are the things that matter now,
So sing along and be prepared.

Maybe we, care about too much 
Time we lost in in spite we run,
That night, but you know i'm wrong.
