COMPLICATIONS

All I know is it's hard for me
Can't tell what's left and right this time-ime
And I don't know where directions lead
Then move from side to side while blinded

It's the life that I lead inside my head
That's killing me again
That kid living life in the moment then
Is drowning in regret

My heart's been through some complications
It's usually alright but
I don't see a sign of life
My mind's held up on conversation
And I don't know if it's right but
I bite my tongue and try to be nice

The doctors say there's still good in me
But I can't wait around inside here
And still we search for our meaning
We're just not meant to find right now oh

It's the life that I lead inside my head
That's killing me again
That kid living life in the moment then
Is drowning in regret

My heart's been through some complications
It's usually alright but
I don't see a sign of life
My mind's held up on conversation
We never should have had
I bite my tongue and try to be nice

I used to think I say some things with meaning to the world
But you will say I lost my voice, my passion, my desire

The world has changed up its mind
The world has changed up its mind (mind)

My heart's been through some complications
My heart's been through some complications
My heart's been through some complications

My heart's been through some complications
My mind's held up on conversation
I am usually alright
So I bite my tongue and try to be nice.
