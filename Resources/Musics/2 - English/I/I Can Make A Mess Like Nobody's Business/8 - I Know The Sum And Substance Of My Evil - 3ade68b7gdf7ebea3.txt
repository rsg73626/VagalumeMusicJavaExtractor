I KNOW THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF MY EVIL

We all knew this day was coming 
Our bitter hearts can hear it calling 
So proud of what youve done so proud of who you are 
Standing tall next to all the buildings 
And filling up with all the reasons why you should never trust yourself 
The way to fool yourself....im fooled

Its those nights alone where your driving
And the sky just looks a little funny 
Your thinking of the worst you figure out the worst
Right after you figure it all out you find a way to straighten your head out 
But what if you are wrong and the world is adding up 
Its throwing signs from random places 
To keep you at your toes so you dont figure it out 
Before you figure it out 

We fall to our knees and beg 
The words are gone 
Its just a thought 

And we fall and we fall 
And we fall to our knees 
And we fall and we fall
(Our bitter hearts can hear it calling 
So proud of what weve done)
