WHEN I HIT THE GROUND

I tried my best to leave the broken parts of me
In the hallway where I wait to watch you walk away
I wonder if I'll run if I chase you would you come?
I just know that something's wrong

So if you leave this town I would follow you right out
The dark of every road to hold you afloat

Cut me deep so you can see
Everything's not what it seems
On my knees I'm breaking down
Just know I loved you when I hit the ground

I wander through these streets a drifter no one sees
Collecting memories of you and me
I never meant to lose control I know I hurt you I was wrong
I should've never let you go

So if you leave this town I would follow you right out
The dark of every road to hold you afloat

Cut me deep so you can see
Everything's not what it seems
On my knees I'm breaking down
Just know I loved you when I hit the ground

Cut me deep so you can see
Everything's not what it seems
On my knees I'm breaking down
Just know I loved you when I hit the ground

Come down I'm always around
So if you fall down I'm always around
Just come down I'm always down
So if you fall down I'm always around

So if you leave this town I would follow you right out
The dark of every road to hold you afloat

Cut me deep so you can see
Everything's not what it seems
On my knees I'm breaking down
Just know I loved you when I hit the ground

Cut me deep so you can see
Everything's not what it seems
On my knees I'm breaking down
Just know I loved you when I hit the ground

Oh I'm choosing us
Oh I'm choosing us
