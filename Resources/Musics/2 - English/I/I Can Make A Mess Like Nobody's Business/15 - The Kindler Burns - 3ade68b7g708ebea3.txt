THE KINDLER BURNS

See james he loves to walk,
It's he all he knows from them
It's all he wants, and some day someone said, 
"james if you run for me, i can make your dreams come true."
He said,"it's not quite what i want, but sign me up."

Well think before you write.
You will see when you left but you hate your life.
And you dont want to be that some day.
You'll thank me tomorrow.

But james said,"no, i will go, and run many many miles."
And he had always be someone he didn't want to be,
But james thats tough
He says," oh no what have i become."
He says," oh no what have i become."

But look at what you'll find.
You can't see that he loves, but he hates his life.
Cause he hides it so well when he smiles,
And he knows that you'll never find out.

What have i become, 
What have i become, 
What have i become, 
He says,"what have i become",
What have i become, 
He says,"what have i become",
What have i become,

See what james didn't know, that it's a shadey business out there.
And everyone is punching up your back, while they took everything you had.
