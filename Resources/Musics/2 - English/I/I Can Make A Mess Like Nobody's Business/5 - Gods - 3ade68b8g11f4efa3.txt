GODS

It was a long haul
It was a dark road
We were fighting for a light
We had to row the boat
Before we sank it in the river
And the mud, it sank deep in my skin
Watching you crawl from the corner looking in
You said, "we are gods."

It was a long night
Through the desert ride
Before our wheels were sinking in
We didn't know much where we were
Our feet were flying toward the ceiling
And a bird, he said, holding his breath
Looking at me cause he thought we cheated death
He said, "we are gods."

Yeah, we own the road
Oh, got control
We had a chokehold on the rest of the world

Until we slow down
And then we go down round

Yeah, we own the road
Oh, got control
We had a chokehold on the rest of the world
We own the road
Oh, got control
We had a chokehold on it

Cause we are gods.

Until we slow down.
