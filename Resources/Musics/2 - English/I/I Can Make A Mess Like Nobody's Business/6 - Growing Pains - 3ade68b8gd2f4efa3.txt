GROWING PAINS

Like a seed I was dropped
On the ground growing up
And that's where I lay

You took me by surprise
And I was lost in your eyes
And that's all I see

And you let me know
I'm not alone
'Cause I'm getting old here
Yes, I'm getting old for
These growing pains

Young enough lost my way
Couldn't talk so I played
Now thats all I know

Watching life from the side
Writing down people hide
And thats where I stay

But you let me know
I'm not alone
'Cause I'm getting old here
Yes, I'm getting old for
These growing pains

Let me go
Let me go

You let me know
I'm not alone
Casue I'm getting old here
Yes, I'm getting old for
These growing pains
These growing pains
