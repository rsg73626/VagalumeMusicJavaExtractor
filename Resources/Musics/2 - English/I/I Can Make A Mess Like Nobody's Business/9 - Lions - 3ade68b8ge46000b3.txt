LIONS

If the sky goes gray and water falls
If I get washed away when the tide goes
If breath becomes a task and punishment
I remember all the things I understand

You had it all, all
If I could spark like a fire, but be as calming as matches
And I would rule like a lion and just go off like a cannon
I could kill like a tiger, and push away all the feeling
But I will run like a coward, go away with the seasons
If I could shine like a diamond, but live alone on the streets
I'd be my best as a lover, and be as cruel as a thief can
You had it all, all

If the sky becomes all smoke and fire burns
Before my lungs give up, I take it in
Breath becomes like tax and punishment
I tried to say the things worth holding in

You had it all, all
If I could spark like a fire, but be as calming as matches
And I would rule like a lion and just go off like a cannon
I could kill like a tiger, and push away all the feeling
But I will run like a coward, go away with the seasons
If I could shine like a diamond, but live alone on the streets
I'd be my best as a lover, and be as cruel as a thief can be
You had it all, all along
You had it all, all
You had it all, all

You had to go from somewhere to be here
