TIMSHEL

I sink into the wall,
And staring up i saw,
Im alone in all my thoughts,
Too afraid to be crazy i run,
It always finds me driving right through town,
With the windows down i fly,
Its the feeling spring has brought,
But an eye for the winter's what i got,
It always finds me...

So tonight,
When i left here,
All i said was goodbye and thats alright,
No "i'll see you later",
I've been trying my whole life,
And if its an eye for an eye why cant i get this right,
Im too slow to go fast,
Im too nervous to do that,
So i run, run away why should I...

I take my chances slow,
After all it's no one's fault,
But the pain seems to crave my life,
So ashamed of my weakness i lie,
It always finds me...

So tonight,
When i left here,
All i said was goodbye and thats alright,
No "i'll see you later",
I've been trying my whole life,
And if its an eye for an eye why cant i get this right,
Im too slow to go fast,
Im too nervous to do that,
So i run, run away why should i...

Why should i?
Why should i? 
Why should i?
