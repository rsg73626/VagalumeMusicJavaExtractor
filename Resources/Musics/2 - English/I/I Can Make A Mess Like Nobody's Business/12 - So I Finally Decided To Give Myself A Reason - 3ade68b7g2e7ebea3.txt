SO I FINALLY DECIDED TO GIVE MYSELF A REASON

It's a night of many frightening things to take in
It's not the way we please ourselves or our friends
It's what we won't accept
It's what will scare us now
Is ourselves, it's ourselves

So tonight as I walk
The moon makes faces at the trees
It's so nice to make fun of everything that I lost,
And I miss, and I love but never had

Tonight I'm gonna take a test to grow up
So I'm sorry for the things I've done to everyone
It's not your face I can't tell
But I try to be this way
It's my own

So tonight as I walk
The moon makes faces at the trees
It's so nice to make fun of everything that I lost,
And I miss, and I love but never had

It's what I can't accept
It's what I can't accept
It is what I can't accept

So tonight as I walk
The moon makes faces at the trees
It's so nice to make fun of everything that I lost,
And I miss, and I love but never had

I'm so happy I could...
Do do dodo
Do do dodo
Do do dodo
Do do dodo
Do do dodo
Do do dodo
Do do dodo
Do do do do
