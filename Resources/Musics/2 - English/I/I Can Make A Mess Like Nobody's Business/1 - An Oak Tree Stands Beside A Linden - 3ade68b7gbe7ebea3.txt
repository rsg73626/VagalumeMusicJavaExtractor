AN OAK TREE STANDS BESIDE A LINDEN

She's so smart today
She thought she could be right here again, but
She can only see, what she's afraid to see
She's now scared...

She says, I, I can't please myself
(Applause please..)
And it's you who I can't be from, unless

Empty stares, did you find it there..
Always by your side, knowing nothing well it's always right
And we've come oh so far to gain some strength and now we've pulled too hard
Now all you want is gone [x2] 
And now I'm all I've got

So he tested time
It's time he thought she'd meet again
It's his selfish mind
That gives him this empty life
He now escapes, he said "I, I can't please myself"
And it's you, your all I want, unless..

Empty stares, thought we'd go down there
Always by your side, knowing nothing, well it's always right
And we've come oh so far to gain some strength and now we've pulled to hard
And now all you want is gone [x2] 
And now I'm all I've got

Wait and see, that it's not 'cause me
It's everything.. in our lives..
I'll make some space but it's hard, 
But I can't do anything to make this wait

And if all you want is gone
And now all you want is gone
And now I'm all I've got...
