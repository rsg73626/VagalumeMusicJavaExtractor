SOMETHING THAT PRODUCES RESULTS

Clever is a general word
While always showing that she's hurt,
But never wrong but never wrong
It takes a lot to make the end
It takes a lot of smart thinking
But never wrong, but never wrong.

And she shows off her skill
Right as she takes it all
Out of her hat you make sure that it's real
And it's all you thought you had and now you're scared
And now you're scared.

Clever, clever is all,
But you're never wrong.
Clever, clever is all,
But you're never wrong.

All I can see is the smiles fall asleep.
And now I'm scared,
And now I'm scared,
And now I'm scared.
