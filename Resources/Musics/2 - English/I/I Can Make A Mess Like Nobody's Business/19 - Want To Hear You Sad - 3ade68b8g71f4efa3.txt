WANT TO HEAR YOU SAD

These eyes they're strongly covered in disguise
They're waiting on the real time again
You'll see that no one knows for sure

For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all
Your loneliness?

This ride is drifting slowly to the side
We're swerving off the road
Going past the cones, that warned us from the start

For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all
Your loneliness?

Everyday goes, Everynight goes
On and on we sing this song for you
Everyday goes, Everynight goes

The entire day that's oh so long

For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all
Your loneliness?
