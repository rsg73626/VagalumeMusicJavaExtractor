WISHPERING ACTUALLY

"So we take the night
If we fall then we're done
So then take it right
This one chance we've got
Don't mess up

Fight with pride
And fight to the end
Strike on
This is your chance
Make it worth your life

So be careful what you see
It can mean the end
Be careful what you read
They're planning the end of you

Fight with pride
And fight to the end
Strike on
This is your chance
Make it worth your life

Fight with pride
And fight to the end
Strike on
This is your chance
Make it worth your life

Fight with pride
And fight to the end
Strike on
This is your chance
Make it worth your life"
