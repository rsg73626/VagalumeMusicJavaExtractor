UNTITLED TRACK 12

So now think of fear, as a person who, wants to know everyone, and what they love, 
And he comes at nite, while you're laying there, he just knows, oh he knows, he gets in your head 

Now walk through the door, the same one you came in, so we can go back, to how things used to be, 
And just walk through the door, the same one, you came in, so we can go back, to how things used to be 

He holds the key, to your smile and he, won't let you, too close to half of what you want, 
But not I, think of it, we've known him our whole life, and we still don't know who, or what he wants 

Just walk through the door, the same one, you came in, so we can go back to how things used to be, 
And just walk through the door, the same one, you came in, so we can go back to how things used to be 

So now walk, through the door, the same one, you came in, so we can, go back, how it used to be, 
And I'll wait, right here, with my arms, by my side, till I can, have back, what I loved before 

Now walk through the door, the same one you came in, so we can go back how things used to be, 
And I will wait right here, with my arms by my side, until I can, have back, what I loved before
