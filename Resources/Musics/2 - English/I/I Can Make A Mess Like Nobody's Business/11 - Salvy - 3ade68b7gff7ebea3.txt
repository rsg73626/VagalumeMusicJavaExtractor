SALVY

Everybody wants to be the person be who you look up to
And you see on t.v. but you know you're not, 
Yeah you know you're not.
No rather, he's been running since the day he was 12
He knew he could be something, he just couldn't tell.
Cause' he was too cool, but he knows he could.

I think it gets him everyday.

Look at yourself, tracing circles of life.
That everybodies on.
Walk on your own, trip and you'll fall. get up.
But you love who you've become.

Maybe it's the people that you see on t.v.
Like the doctor who thinks that he knows everything.
Oh i'm sure you do, you should live it too.
Now deby she's been wrong since the day she was born,
There's always someone telling her of how shes wrong.
She knows she's not, yeah i know you're not.

At least listens everyday.
Look at yourself, tracing circles of life.
That everyones on.
Walk on your own. trip and you'll fall. get up.
But you love who you've become.

Look at yourself, tracing circles of life.
That everyones on.
Walk on your own. trip and you'll fall. get up.
But you love who you've become.

Now salvy he's been yelling for about 50 years,

But i'm still unasigned, well i know you're right.
