I will commit suicide at the very peak of our desperate love
So it will never get the chance to weaken or fade
And you will do the same
Only to immortalize our unified hearts
And so that every moment
Will remain fresh in both our minds

And this will be ours
(Forever like the stars)
And this will be ours
(Forever like the stars)
And this will be ours
(Forever like the stars)
And this will be ours
(Forever like the stars)
