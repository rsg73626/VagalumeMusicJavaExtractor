NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE

How we running out of enough time
Should we looking to the light
Cause this be the day we die
This could be the final fight

I feel the instinct to survive
Today is not the day we die

You'll never take me
You'll never take me
You'll never take me
You'll never take me alive

You'll never take me
You'll never take me
You'll never take me
You'll never take me alive

Ohh ohh
You'll never take me alive
Ohh ohh
