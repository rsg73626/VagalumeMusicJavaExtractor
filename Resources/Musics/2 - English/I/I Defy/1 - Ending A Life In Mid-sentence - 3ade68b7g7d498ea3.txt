ENDING A LIFE IN MID-SENTENCE

So they, make believe;
They don’t know they fool themselves.
Embarrassed, but not ashamed
to admit that I don’t know.

F*** the stars – burn the books – 
Race yourself to the beginning.

And nothing that I say will be remembered
unless it’s written down; unless it’s carved in stone.
Uncertainty is all that’s sure.
Does it really matter?! Does anybody care?!
The stars will fade in time; Our voices fade with years.

So I push away
these earthly things - my humanness.
There has to be something else. 
Born into the wrong world.

F*** the stars – burn the books – 
Race yourself to the beginning.

And nothing that I say will be remembered
unless it’s written down; unless it’s carved in stone.
Uncertainty is all that’s sure.
Does it really matter?! Does anybody care?!
The stars will fade in time; Our voices fade with years.

And nothing that I say will be remembered
unless it’s written down; unless it’s carved in stone.
Uncertainty is all that’s sure.
Does it really matter?! Does anybody care?!
Uncertainty is all that’s sure.
The stars will fade in time; Our voices fade with years.
