YOUR AMERICA

Red white and blue
they inject in our minds;
It's on the evening news
and it's making us blind.
A picture perfect image
where everything's fine;
You'll never see the curtain
they're hiding us behind

This is your America!

This is your America for which you would die
this is your America, WHY? 
(X2)

They tell you that it's freedom
expecting no question. 
They tell you that you need them. They hide their true intentions;
cause if you knew the truth 
that you weren't a drone
then you'd know you were able
to stand on your own.

This is your America!

This is your America, 
for which you would die.
This is your America, 
WHY?
(X2)

the tree of liberty 
must be watered by blood.
Watered by blood, 
Watered by blood,

This is your America,
for which you would die.
This is your America, 
WHY?
(X2)

The tree of liberty must be watered by blood
(Repeated several times)
