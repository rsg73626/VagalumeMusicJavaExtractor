NEVER BREAK

Never, will I abandon
what I've fought so hard to keep.
The light that guides me
will never be put out.

Call me narrow-minded, call me strange.
I have my convictions and they'll never change.
Call me old-fashioned, with no appeal.
At least I have something to keep me real.

Fighting on my own!
Never give up hope.

I live for myself,
never breaking for anybody else.
I'll fight alone, a one man army;
Never giving in, never giving up.

Call me narrow-minded, call me strange.
I have my convictions and they'll never change.
Call me old-fashioned, with no appeal.
At least I have something to keep me real.

Fighting on my own!
Never give up hope.

Never, will I abandon
what I've fought so hard to keep.
The light that guides me
will never be put out.

Fighting on my own!
Never give up hope.
