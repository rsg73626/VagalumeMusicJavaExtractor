I watched you slip.
I watched you fall.
(X2)

I watched you slip
right through my hands.
Even though I've tried 
to put things right.
You didn't even fu**ing try.
Did you even care at all?

Reflections tell the truth. 
Your eyes hold no lies.
Buried emotions screaming out. 
Let go of chains that bind.
Trapped in your own prison.
The walls you've built 
have shut you out...
Drag you down,
Strips you away,
Bit by bit, 
all that was you....

Self righteous now. 
Self righteous now.
Lost you some how. 
Look who's self righteous now!

Just you and yourself, 
all by yourself.
You've picked your battles
and lost your ground.
Now which side of the fence do you stand on?
Don't put the blame on me.

Watched you...
slip away...
Never give...
you just take
away from me...
All I see...are tainted red visions of someone I knew....

I watched you slip.
I watched you fall.
