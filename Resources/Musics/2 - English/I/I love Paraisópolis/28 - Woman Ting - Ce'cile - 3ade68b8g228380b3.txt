Let me tell u something
Low woman things, low woman things

Chorus
We cant hot again cause a di man dem
Dema a buy off we blouse and we pants dem
Them thief we pink colour my god then
Dem nu soon start want wear wi thong then

My youth why u pants fi tighter than mine
And why u pants no de a you waistline?

A group a man a buy dem off fi go a dancehall go pose

Chorus
We cant hot again cause a di man dem
Dema a buy off we blouse and we pants dem

And di crawl up pan di box to stacy dem
And di bruk out bruck out to junkoo dem
