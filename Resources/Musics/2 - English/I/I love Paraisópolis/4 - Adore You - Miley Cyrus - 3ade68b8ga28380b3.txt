ADORE YOU - MILEY CYRUS

Baby, baby
Are you listening
Wondering
Where you've been all my life
I just started living
Oh baby
Are you listening

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy I adore you-u-u-u
I adore you-u-u-u

Baby
Can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you
I'm scared oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
I am armed with weapons

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy I adore you-u-u-u
I adore you-u-u-u

I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When he led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy I adore you-u-u-u
I adore you-u-u-u

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy I adore you-u-u-u
I adore you-u-u-u
