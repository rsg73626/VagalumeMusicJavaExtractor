I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU - FRANK SINATRA

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol it doesn't move me at all
So tell me why should it be true?
That I get a... kick, out of you!

Some like the bop-type refrain
I'm sure that if, I heard even one riff
To would it bore me terrifically too
Yet, I get a kick out of you

I get a kick, every time
I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet, I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time
I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet, I get a... kick, yes
I get a... kick, yes
I get a kick... out of you!
