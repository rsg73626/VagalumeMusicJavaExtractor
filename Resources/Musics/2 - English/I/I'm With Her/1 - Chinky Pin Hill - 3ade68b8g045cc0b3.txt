CHINKY PIN HILL

Come along with me and we will get away from it all
We'll go through the mountain's pass, shiny waterfalls

And the only sound we'll hear at night will be the [?]
And the chirping of the crickets on Chinky Pin Hill

We'll stop in the Rainbow Valley where the church is standing still
Then we'll be newly-wed married on Chinky Pin Hill

And the road is so confusing as I go from day to day
And sometimes I get worried that I'll lose you on the way

I looked up at the stars as I leaned on the window sill
I've dreamed up I hide awake up on Chinky Pin Hill
Chinky Pin Hill, Chinky Pin Hill
