I BELIEVE IN LOVE

I believe in love 
And in my dreams you're so romantic 
I got this feeling in the middle of the night 
'Cause baby 
I believe in love 
And with your joy you make me frenzy 
Somebody help me in the middle of the night 
Of the night 

Suddenly 
You just broke my heart 
No time to run 
No place to hide my soul 
You're so deep inside my mind 
And now I need your love 
Close your eyes, baby 
Come to me 
I'll love you more than yesterday 
My love, without you life's black and white 
Don't let me down tonight 
I don't know what the people say 
I don't know why my heart is so weak 
Could it be you? 
Now I'm loosing my mind 
Please take my hand 

Cause baby... 

Close your eyes, baby

Don't let me down tonight 
I don't know what the people say 
I don't know why my heart is so weak 
Could it be you 
Now I'm loosing my mind 
Please take my hand 

Cause baby...
