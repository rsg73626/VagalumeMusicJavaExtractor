LET ME TAKE YOUR LOVE

Oh babe I wonder why you set me free 
Your love is tender like a lovely melody 
Don't find another. It will never be the same 
Don't say it's over, let me try with you again 
Honey stay with me. Your love is like a mistery 
I don't wanna break your heart again 
Please don't take your love away 

Baby let me take your love 
Oh baby I just need your love 
Everyday the beat of my heart is near me 
Baby please don't go. Baby let me take your love 
Oh baby I just need your love 
Night and day it's you that I'm dreaming of baby 
Take a place in my heart and my soul 

It's not so easy to find the best in me 
I know you miss me. Love is like a mistery 
I'm not a liar and my heart is not insane 
You're my desire, let me tell you once again 
Honey stay with me. I try to play your melody 
I don't wanna break your heart again 
Please don't take your love away
