WHEN YOU GO OUT

When you're going out
When i'm staying in
Keep your head above
Head above water

You could start again
Keep your head above
We don't want each other
We don't want our love

Start from one and two
Count from one to five
We can't change this feeling
We can't change this time

Learn to, learn to trust
Let no one else in
Start from one and two
Count from one to five

When you go out
And i'm staying in
Little has changed
But it's just enough
WHEN YOU GO OUT

When you're going out
When i'm staying in
Keep your head above
Head above water

You could start again
Keep your head above
We don't want each other
We don't want our love

Start from one and two
Count from one to five
We can't change this feeling
We can't change this time

Learn to, learn to trust
Let no one else in
Start from one and two
Count from one to five

When you go out
And i'm staying in
Little has changed
But it's just enough
