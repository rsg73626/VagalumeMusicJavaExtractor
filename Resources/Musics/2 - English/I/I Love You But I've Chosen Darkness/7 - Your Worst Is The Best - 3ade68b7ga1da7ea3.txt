YOUR WORST IS THE BEST

So arrogant
Your worst is the best
It's so easy
To make a fucked-up mistake
And walk away
Just like it was
Or move away
Miles between us

If i ever forget
It was never so perfect
Such a boring story told
You make me feel so old
But confident

So arrogant
Your worst is the best
It's so easy
To make a fucked-up mistake
And walk away
Just like it was
Or move away
Miles between us
