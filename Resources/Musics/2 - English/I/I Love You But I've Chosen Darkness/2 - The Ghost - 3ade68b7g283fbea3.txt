THE GHOST

A fire swept through
Everyone rushed for the door
Boards were used to carry the impaired
The rescuers had withdrawn

The building is virtually black now
That's what the witness said

I think about how I miss you
And how I will remain
I think about how I miss you

A fire swept through
Everyone rushed for the door
Boards were used to carry the impaired
The rescuers had withdrawn

I think about how I miss you
And how I will remain
I think about how I miss you
I think about how I miss you
I think about how I miss you
I think about how I miss you
I think about how I miss you
