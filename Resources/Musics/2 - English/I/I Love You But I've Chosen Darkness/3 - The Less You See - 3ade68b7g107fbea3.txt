THE LESS YOU SEE

I tried to work up 
The nerve to say
I didn't think
It happened this way
How could I know?

Imagine what matters the most
Getting by to spite you

I know your boundaries
You make it so clear
And the worst is still
Always near

I know your boundaries
You make it so clear
And the worst is still
Always near

I tried to work up
The nerve to say
I didn't think
It happened this way

I would quit it
In a second
I would quit it
I would quit it
