WE'RE STILL THE WEAKER SEX

There's no reason to stay
And there's nothing to say
It's been over, we've been through
For so long, for so long

And I don't understand
Why you take it so
So hard
So hard

It's the last
We won't change
It's self abuse
To stay the same

I can't figure out
Why you take so much
So much time
So much time

It's the last
We won't change
It's self abuse
To stay the same

I can't figure out
Why you take it so
So far
So far

You wear your heart on your sleeve
(You wear your heart on your sleeve)
You don't want to believe
You wear your heart on your sleeve
(You wear your heart on your sleeve)
You don't want to believe
You wear your heart on your sleeve
(You wear your heart on your sleeve)
You don't want to believe

It's the last
We won't change
It's self abuse
To stay the same

And I don't understand
Why you take it so
So hard
So hard

It's the last
We won't change
We won't change
We won't change
