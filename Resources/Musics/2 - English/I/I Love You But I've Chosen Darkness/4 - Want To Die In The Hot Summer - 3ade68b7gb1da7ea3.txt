WANT TO DIE IN THE HOT SUMMER

A moving stream
It's time to go
Torn apart
Once again

Disturb and resolve
The memories of you
Wearing down that we're through
Moving in circles
Watching your eyes
Balance on my part is lost again

A moving stream
The memories of you
Sleeping at night
Now we're through
Moving in circles
Glisten outside
Torn apart
Once again
