DEATH OF YOU

I'll be the death of you
When I feel like there's nothing to lose
Oh, no, there's nothing to lose

I'll be the death of you
There's a killer out on the loose
Hangman tying the noose

We'll never know the reasons why
Between the lines and classified
And through these mirrors and cracks
You'll never come back alive

I'll be the death of you
When I feel like there's nothing to lose
Oh, no, there's nothing to lose

I'll be the death of you
Riding faultlines heading for you
Hitman lighting the fuse

We'll never know the reasons why
Between the lines and classified
And through these mirrors and cracks
You'll never come back alive
Through these mirrors and cracks
You'll never come back alive

Cut the cables of time
And you'll never know it owns you

You'll never feel it's breath
Cold upon your neck
You'll never hear it's voice
As it cracks with death

You'll never hang from the years that fly
As they wash you ashore
Never hiding the face of fear
As the age cuts through the core

You'll never know where I've been
You'll never know where I've been
Cut the cables of time
Cut the cables of time
Cut the cables of time
And you'll never know it owns you
And I'll be the death of you
The death of you
