ELETRIC THRONE

Your king was just a con-man
And the crown you found,
Was not more than a beggar’s bowl,
Turned upside down.
But it’s still intoxicating
And you wear it well
A halo that could bring the devil,
Right out of you.

Electric throne it gets me high
(To hang you high)
A beggar’s soldier is taking over my mind
(To hang you high)

[Kim Benzie]
Your saints were just a signpost,
Somebody turned around.
Still wearing the same addiction,
Turned inside out.
You break the bones of history,
You break the speed of sound,
For not more than a beggar’s bowl,
Turned upside down.

Electric throne it gets me high
(To hang you high)
A beggar’s soldier is taking over my mind

[Kim Benzie]
Your head and heart become estranged
Bodies hanging on the high-road
And maybe they, gave you away
And left you hanging on the high-nail.
They left you high.
It left you high.

And do the pearls of wisdom form a noose?
To hang you high,
To pull the more you move.
And maybe it gave you away.
And maybe it gave you away,
And left you hanging high

And maybe it gave you away...
Or does the crown wear you?
Corrupting hands hold you.
A devil by your side

This cosmonaut
Of the soul.
But are you still wearing the crown?
Are you still wearing the crown?

Electric throne it gets me high
(To hang you high)
A beggar’s soldier is taking over my mind
(To hang you high)
