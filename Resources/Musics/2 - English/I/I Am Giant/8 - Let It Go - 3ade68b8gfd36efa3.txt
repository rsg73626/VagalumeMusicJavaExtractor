LET IT GO

Masquerade,
A mask of steel.
Winding life,
Onto the reel.

And playing back now, the scenes that you looked away from.
As they burn your eyes,
And leave you blind.

Let it go now
Living the lie,
With so much love tonight.
Let it go now
Living the lie,
With so much love tonight.

She concedes,
That change is calling.
He’s not the man,
She thought she fell for.
He wants her so bad that heaven could be inside her
A silver touch.
From golden gloves.

Let it go now
Living the lie,
With so much love tonight.

Frozen on the figurine
Credits rolling up the screen
It’s over now
It’s over.

Frozen frames of beauty queens
Reaching through the silver screen, of this lie.
It’s over.

Why are you so cynical living in the mess you made?
Why are you so cynical, can’t prove yourself to everyone
It’s over.

Let it go now
Living the lie,
With so much love tonight.
Let it go now
Living the lie,
With so much love tonight.
