AND WE'LL DEFY

A moment of your time, please.
It’s the need to belong.
A movement that defines you.
A city where you won’t have to feel alone.

Searching for the new world,
And sailing over the edge.
I’m paying off the preacher,
And paying off his debts.

I’ll close my eyes forever.
I’ll close my eyes forever.
I’ll close my eyes and follow you.
I’ll close my eyes and follow you.

The blind leading the blind, now
Holding nuclear hands.
I’m slipping on the blood-stained,
Stairs to heaven’s gate.

I’ll close my eyes forever.

I’ll close my eyes forever.
I’ll close my eyes and follow you.
I’ll close my eyes and follow you.
And we’ll defy.
And we’ll defy.

Sell me a vision for love is blind.
Falsely imprisoned,
Where love is blind.
My love is blind.
And I’ll follow you
I’ll close my eyes
And follow you

And we’ll defy
And we’ll defy
And we’ll defy (Sell me a vision, for love is blind)
And we’ll defy (Falsely imprisoned, where love is blind)
And we’ll defy (My love is blind)
And I’ll follow you
And we’ll defy (My love is blind)
And I’ll follow you
