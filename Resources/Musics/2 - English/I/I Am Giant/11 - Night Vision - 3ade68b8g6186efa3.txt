NIGHT VISION

Black water,
The thrill of the unknown.
Blindfolded,
Pulling me out overboard.
Unspoken,
But sitting inside all our words.
Unfolding,
The future from around my core.

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

Slow motion,
Iâ€™m showing all my fears.
Forgotten,
Fingers running through her hair.
And time,
Has ceased to matter anymore.
And time becomes imagined,
Like shadows reaching out from the wall.
Slowing down it almost
Stops.

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

A shot goes
Am I your ricochet?
Am I falling?
Am I your ricochet?
Where do we go from here?
Am I falling
Am I your ricochet?
Where do we go from here?
Am I falling?
Am I your ricochet?
