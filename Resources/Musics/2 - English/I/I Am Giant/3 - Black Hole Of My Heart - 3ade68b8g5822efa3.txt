BLACK HOLE OF MY HEART

You’ll wait for a miracle,
So you can turn it inside out.
You’ll cut the umbilical,
And float into the lion’s mouth.

Killer clown.
Lost inside this hall of mirrors.
Killer clown.
It’s the guilt that really kills you now.

Welcome to the black hole of my heart,
Where you float
Helpless through the black hole of my heart
And you float.

Corroding old carousel,
Your passengers are all long gone.
Spinning a lonely tune,
The only one you’ve ever known.

Killer clown.
Screaming at your own reflection.
Killer clown.
It’s the guilt that really kills you now.

Welcome to the black hole of my heart
Where you float.
Helpless through the black hole of my heart
And you float.

You can paint your face,
But you know you’re going to do it again.
You can swear you’ve changed
But you know you’re going to do it again.
And again.

Welcome to the black hole of my heart
Where you float.
Helpless through the black hole of my heart
And you float.

Welcome to the black hole
Of my heart.
Welcome to the black hole
Of my heart (of my heart)
Where you float
Where you float
