LIFE IN CAPTIVITY

So tell me I'm living
Not merely just standing on the gallows
On the gallows

So where are my angels?
When I'm drowning my demons in the fire
In the fire

Life is standing here and waiting for a ride
A ride that never comes
Time is standing still whenever I'm with you
But you will never know

So who am I fooling?
I keep feeding the fire with these home truths
With these home truths

And what if I told you
Life only begins here
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

Feeding the fire
Drowning my demons
Say I'm just raising my glass now to life
So this is life in captivity
