DRAG MY NAME THROUGH THE MUD

Drag my name through the mud,
Wipe me off your screen.
Ye-eah-eaah
Wipe my name from the board,
Drag me over the broken glass.

Handing me the grenade,
And keeping the pin.
Ye-eah-eaah
Drag me over the coals
Taking over control of me.

And now this dream becomes decay.
Just waiting for the birds of prey.

Drag my name through the mud,
Go on and cut the cord.
Ye-eah-eaah
Wrap me up in decay,
Like a lovers embrace gone bad.

Handing me the controls,
And cutting the wires.
Ye-eah-eaah
Running over my face,
Like the hands of disgrace have done.

And now this dream becomes decay
Just waiting for the birds of prey
And now your son becomes the sin
Just waiting for the birds of prey
(birds of prey)

You look for signs of life
In the bones
Check your pulse (check your pulse)
(for signs)
(check your pulse)
(check your pulse)
(for signs)

Drag my name through the mud,
And tie me up in chains.
Ye-eah-eaah.
Drag me through your parade,
Bleeding over the broken glass.
Woah-ohh

And now this dream becomes decay.
Just waiting for the birds of prey.

You dragged me through the mud,
By my name.
Dragged me across the coals by my name.
You dragged me through the mud,
By my name.
