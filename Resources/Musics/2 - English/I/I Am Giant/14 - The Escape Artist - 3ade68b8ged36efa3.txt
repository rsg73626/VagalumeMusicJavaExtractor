THE ESCAPE ARTIST

I don’t know why,
I can’t explain.
An artist of,
The great escape.
I don’t know why
I levitate,
Above the rest of the cabaret.

I don’t know why,
I can’t explain.
You’re on the trail of a renegade.
The work of an, illusionist.
I never thought I’d get away with this.

A trapdoor that opens in the real world,
And lets in,
The arcane.
A trapdoor that opens underneath you,
Each time,
You lie.

I didn’t think I’d get away with this.
I didn’t think of an escape.
I didn’t think I’d get away with this.
I didn’t think of an escape.

I don’t know why, I can’t explain.
Lock me up and throw the key away.
Sleight of hand;
Parlor tricks.
A drinking game with the alchemist.

I don’t know why
I can’t explain.
I’m vanishing, without a trace.
And falling for,
This fantasy.

You’d fall in love with a murder scene.

A trapdoor that opens in the real world,
And lets in,
The arcane.
A trapdoor that opens underneath you,
Each time,
You lie.

I didn’t think I’d get away with this.
I didn’t think of an escape.
I didn’t think I’d get away with this.
I didn’t think of an escape.

If this is the real world,
Then I become an illusion.
If this is the real world,
Then I become an illusion.

I become an illusion
I become your illusion

I didn’t think I’d get away with this.

I become an illusion.
(A trapdoor that opens in the real world) I become an illusion.
