PURPLE HEART

You’re starting to feel,
You’re not bulletproof.
Breathe it in,
Breathe it out.
Wiping the blood,
From your purple heart.
Breathe it in and breathe it out.

You don’t wanna look,
But you just can’t help yourself.
You know that it could,
Someday be the death of you.

Is this what it feels like to find out?
Is this what it feels like?
Is this what it feels like to find out?
Is this what it feels like?

You’re starting to feel,
The years in your bones.
Breathe it in,
Breathe it out.
The face in the mirror is starting to fade,
Breathe it in and breathe it out.

You don’t wanna look,
But you just can’t help yourself.
You know that it could,
Someday be the death of you.

Is this what it feels like to find out?
Is this what it feels like?
Is this what it feels like to find out,
Just what it feels like?

You’re holding up,
Your own halo.
Your purple heart.
Your halo.

You don’t wanna know,
But you still can’t look away.
You’re hanging the hope from,
The ribbon of your purple heart.

Is this what it feels like to find out?
Is this what it feels like?
Is this what it feels like to find out?
Is this what it feels like?
