LIVING THE CRASH

As lucid as the dream,
Where you wake behind the wheel.
Strange that you should feel,
Paralyzed.
The dream where you can fly,
And you rise above your hometown,
And tell them they can keep,
Their gravity.

Are you wide awake?
Caught in the crossfire, caught in the crash.
Are you wide awake?
Born in the crossfire, living the crash.

As lucid as the punch,
You’re throwing in slow-motion.
A fist you cannot lift.
A fight you cannot win.
And would you really die,
If you hit the bottom?
If the ground didn’t wake you up,
In the falling dream.

Are you wide awake?
Caught in the crossfire, caught in the crash.
Are you wide awake?
Born in the crossfire, living the crash.

Smashing your way through the looking-glass.
Fantasy can still be razor-sharp...
For you.

For you who wanted everything,
For you who promised everything.

Something followed you back,
And woke up in the crash.
Somehow, followed you out of your domain.
Something followed you back,
Out through the looking-glass,
Somehow bringing a cloud of the surreal.

Are you wide awake?
Caught in the crossfire, caught in the crash.
Are you wide awake?
Born in the crossfire, living the crash.
Now are you,
Are you wide awake now?
Now are you,
Are you wide awake now?
(Are you wide awake now?)
Are you wide awake now?
