RUSSIAN DOLL

I don't want you to worry
I'm not gonna say
The words I've repeated
Many times in my head

I want you to see me
Only with monochrome eyes
To see trough the shadow
To somehow change your mind

And even now
You see the signs
In black and white
And even now
You can't believe

You've done this to yourself (self)
The cracks begin to show
The devil that you know
You've done this to yourself (self)
The only love you know
Lying cold
Inside a russian doll

I want you to see me
With yesterday's eyes
A view to believe in
Magnified in your mind

I want you to find me
Where only the chosen can go
Where I'm keeping a secret
That only you would know

And even now
You see the signs
In black and white
And even now
You can't believe

You've done this to yourself (self)
The cracks begin to show
The devil that you know
You've done this to yourself (self)
The only love you know
Lying cold
Inside a russian doll

In black and white
This proof of life
Before

You've done this to yourself (self)
The cracks begin to show
The devil that you know
You've done this to yourself (self)
The only love you know
Lying cold
Inside a russian doll
