BUT COMON IM USELESS

Build it up tear it down, turn round, turn round, oh comon
what am i doing wrong?

Been so long that ive been waiting
is it wrong that im complaining?
is it nice not having to talk to me?

you know exactly how to make me feel like im worthless
these thoughts are keeping me awake, i wont, wont ever give up

pay attention;
cant you see me wondering what, what im doing wrong?
your not satisfied, your not satisfied, what am i doing wrong?
oh what i do to get anything but lies out of you

why do you make up excuses?
i do too, but comon im useless
is it nice not having to talk to me?

I'm feeling like a polaroid; static and out of date
your smile is making me avoid saying a thing to your face

pay attention;
cant you see me wondering what, what im doing wrong?
your not satisfied, your not satisfied, what am i doing wrong?
oh what i do to get anything but lies out of you

build it up, tear it down
out of luck? turn round
lead me on
oh comon its just like were in the movies
were in the movies
where do you get off
laughing at the way you never could like me
you don't notice how hard i, how hard i try.

you know exactly how to make me feel like im worthless
these thoughts are keeping me awake, i wont, wont ever give up

pay attention;
cant you see me wondering what, what im doing wrong?
your not satisfied, your not satisfied, what am i doing wrong?
oh what i do to get anything but lies out of you

pay attention;
cant you see me wondering what, what im doing wrong?
your not satisfied, your not satisfied, what am i doing wrong?
oh what i do to get anything but lies out of you

to get anything but lies out of you
