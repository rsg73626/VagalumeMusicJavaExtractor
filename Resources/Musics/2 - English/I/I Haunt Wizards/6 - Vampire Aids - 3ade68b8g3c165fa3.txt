VAMPIRE AIDS

The tide won't sink us all. 
It's like a bad dream but no one wakes me or pulls me out. 
I could watch but i wouldn't laugh as she screams his name. 
I know it - I know that I know.

So lets turn a page and darken bright days, 
it's not your problem now 
but i just dont know how i don't.

I feel like broken windows can't, 
they won't stab her in the side. 
In between her thighs isn't dignified; 
just like the way that she spoke to me.

But its not the same she won't sigh this way 
I can't taste the floor, 
this doesn't have a cure. 
She loses her breath indifferently, I dont.

I don't think that i'll bother anymore, it's hopeless. Invisible candles are all I have left now
