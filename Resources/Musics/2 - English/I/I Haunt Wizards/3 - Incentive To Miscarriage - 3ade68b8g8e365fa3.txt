INCENTIVE TO MISCARRIAGE

i'd like nothing more than nothing;
nothing to do with someone looking so
dank, spawning a miscarriage.

i aint always out at dawn if nobodies alturistic
it wont ever change, kind of like incest infecting
children cry, dont care why

make up all your problems
no-ones gonna solve them
im wasting time, wishing its what I had
lasting a while longer, il always wonder why

The moon is something i dont
understand anymore, lakes are flooding
into my path and i dont like it

dank, spawning a miscarriage.

I aint always out of phase with other thought
as if I could never problem solve
I don’t see where anyone gets off
Thinking they’re perfect
Children die, yet your alive?

make up all your problems
no-ones gonna solve them
im wasting time, wishing its what I had
lasting a while longer, il always wonder why

The moon is something i dont
understand anymore, lakes are flooding
into my path and i dont like it
The moon is something i dont
understand anymore, lakes are flooding
into my path and i dont like it

Nothing compares to the sound
Of laughing at you trying to think aloud
I will always wonder why

The moon is something i dont
understand anymore, lakes are flooding
into my path and i dont like it

Nobodies incentives are quite as they might seem
i'd like nothing more than nothing;
nothing to do with someone looking so
