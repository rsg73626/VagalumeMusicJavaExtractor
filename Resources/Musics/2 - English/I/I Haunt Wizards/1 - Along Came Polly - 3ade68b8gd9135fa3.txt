ALONG CAME POLLY

I am not as i am portrayed darling
I stand minutes away from discovery
A victim of social pressure
There aint no pleasure

Idle hands start work tonight
The schedules too tight
I cant compare no
I loom into the stars
But i can never have them
I can never have them

In my life i dont have anyone
To get to know and it will probably stay that way

I know i'm not afraid to take away the darling
Im an anomaly, as you undress whats left
I think im going home, think im going home

I dont make sense anymore
Im pacing the floor
Thinking what i'm supposed to say to you
Im wasting my time now
Im wasting my time now

In my life i dont have anyone
To get to know and it will probably stay that way
I know in my life i dont have anyone
To get to know and it will probably stay that way

I know im not half as worth your time of day
When it could be all spent with that idiot
My stars cant compare to his universe, i give up.

I never said i dont not need anyone
Your the one that i thought i could trust.
