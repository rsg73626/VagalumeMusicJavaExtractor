SAILOR MOON

Somehow make her feel like a princess then sever her castles. Her kingdom can just lay broken. I wouldn't tell it straight its better this way. Only believe it; scars and lifeless hopes only come of it, theres no concern so long as she melts.
I don't need advise; I taste just like your best friend two days ago. I'm not who you think I am, i'll always wear masks to hide picasso
