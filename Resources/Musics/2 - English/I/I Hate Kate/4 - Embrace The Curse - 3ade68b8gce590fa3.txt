EMBRACE THE CURSE

I am a hologram
I am the ghost that's laying next to you
Watching you breathe
I am a wanted man
Feels so electric as they're chasing me
Still I can't sleep

It's me against the world today
And that's fine
It's me against the world

And so I stand
I embrace the curse
I embrace the song
I embrace what I feel
When I feel what's wrong
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse
I embrace what I am
I embrace the curse

Tonight is our escape
Today integrity is killing me
Still I can't see
The choices that we make
Are not the choices they want us to make
Who asked them anyway

It's me against the world today
And that's fine
It's me against the world

And so I stand
I embrace the curse

I embrace the song
I embrace what I feel
When I feel what's wrong
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse
I embrace what I am
I embrace the curse

I know you know exactly what I mean
I know you know what I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel

It's me against the world today
And that's fine
It's me against the world

I embrace the curse
I embrace the song
I embrace what I feel
When I feel what's wrong
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse
I embrace what I am
I embrace the curse

I embrace the curse
I embrace the song
I embrace what I feel
When I feel what's wrong
I embrace the hurt
The hate and what's worse
I embrace what I am
I embrace the curse
