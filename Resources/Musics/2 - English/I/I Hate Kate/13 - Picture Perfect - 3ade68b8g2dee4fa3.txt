PICTURE PERFECT

Picture perfect eyes of abandon 
Cry a river to drown me in 
Picture perfect lies on the table are you in? 

And it’s eating me alive 
Eating me alive 

Take me 
Take me far away 
From all the shit that’s going on outside 
I need a better place 

Break me 
Break me free from these chains 
That keep me bound to your riot deep inside 
I need a better place 

Picture perfect disguise on your face 
One mistake and it’s all black 
Let’s decide not to divide and get it back 
It’s the footsteps I hear in the hallway 
The silhouette on a foggy night 
Your scent left on my pillow I still find 

And it’s eating me alive 
Eating me alive 

Take me 
Take me far away 
From all the shit that’s going on outside 
I need a better place 

Break me 
Break me free from these chains 
That keep me bound to your riot deep inside 
I need a better place 

Take me 
Take me far away 
From all the shit that’s going on outside 
I need a better place 

Break me 
Break me free from these chains 
That keep me bound to your riot deep inside 
I need a better place 

Take me 
Take me far away 
From all the shit that’s going on outside 
I need a better place 

Break me 
Break me free from these chains 
That keep me bound to your riot deep inside 
I need a better place to 
Place to find
