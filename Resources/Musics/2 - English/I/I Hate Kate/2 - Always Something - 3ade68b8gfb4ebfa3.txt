ALWAYS SOMETHING

Well, it's friday night and it seems to me
Tonight's not going down in history but
I'll tell you something honey
It's always better when I'm with you
Cut the glamour and all the fame
all the big stars trying to make a name
I'll tell you something else...
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you

Tonight
I just don't wanna say goodbye to you
I just don't wanna say it's over too
Get me through tonight
Tonight
Be part of me

Well, call the records and stop the press and
Did I tell you how I'm impressed by your
Beautiful smile and your plastic dress but
I got a girl for me at home
The kids are hanging out lester square
Looking at me like I don't care
I'll tell you something else...
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you

Tonight
I just don't wanna say goodbye to you
I just don't wanna say it's over too
Get me through tonight

Tonight
I just don't wanna say goodbye to you
I just don't wanna say it's over too
Get me through tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Be part of me

woah woah woo-o-woah

Tonight
I just don't wanna say goodbye to you
I just don't wanna say it's over too
Get me through tonight

Tonight
I just don't wanna say goodbye to you
I just don't wanna say it's over too
get me through tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Be part of me

Tonight
Be part of me
Tonight
Be part of
part of me
