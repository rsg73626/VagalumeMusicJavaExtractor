BED OF BLACK ROSES

In my bed of black roses 
Where I dream secrets the back of my eyelids keep 

So you wanna believe all the things you've been told 
And all the promises that you won't grow old 
In the life made up of strings 
Being pulled by secret beings 
And now I know my falls and fights that brought me here 
Of things that seem to disappear you can't understand my sane nightmare 

In my bed of black roses 
Where I dream secrets the back of my eyelids keep 
In my red sky hypnosis 
It’s only my beginning 
And I have the feeling I’ll go 
Down my own road 

Everyone still walks with fear in their lives 
Past the place movie stars go to die 
Streetlights filter through my blinds 
Knowing life's a real short time 
And now I shake the hands of all my old enemies 
I ignore the threat of their disease 
I choose the road ahead I please 

In my bed of black roses 
Where I dream secrets the back of my eyelids keep 
In my red sky hypnosis 
It’s only my beginning 
And I have the feeling I’ll go 

If this is what you are 
Than this is where I am 
If this is where you are 
Than this is where I stand 
I stand alone 
Alone 

Bed of black roses 
Where I dream secrets the back of my eyelids keep 
In my red sky hypnosis 
It’s only my beginning 
And I have the feeling that I’ll go 
I’ll go down my own road 

Bed of black roses 
Where I dream secrets the back of my eyelids keep 
In my red sky hypnosis 
It’s only my beginning 
And I have the feeling I’ll go 
Where ever it is I want to go 

Woah, woah
