IT'S ALWAYS BETTER

Well it's 4 AM and it seems to me
Tonight's not going down in history
But I'll tell you something honey
It's always better when I'm with you

The glitz and glamour and all the fame
All the big stars trying to make a name
And I'll tell you something else
It's always better when I'm with you

It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through
Tonight, tonight, tonight you're part of me

Well call the records and stop the press
And did I tell you that I'm impressed with your
Beautiful smile and your plastic dress
But I've got a girl for me at home

The kids are hanging out in Leicester Square
Looking at me like I even care
But I'll tell you something else
It's always better when I'm with you

It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you
It's always better when I'm with you

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through tonight

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through
Tonight, tonight, tonight you're part of me

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through tonight

Tonight I just don't want to say goodbye to you
I just don't want to say it's over to get me through
Tonight, tonight, tonight you're part of me

Tonight you're part of me
Tonight you're part of
You're part of me
