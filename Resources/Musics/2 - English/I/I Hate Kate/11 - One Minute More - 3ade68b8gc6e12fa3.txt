ONE MINUTE MORE

One Minute More
Can we pretend we feel alright one minute more as you hold me under water just one minute more

you got alot nerve you got alot of desire pretty young vampire
you got alot of love alot alot of direction creating this affection i wanna make you bleed wanna make you sing i got nothing to say for myself you gotta lot to say never wanna listen whoahh

[chorus]
can we pretend we feel alright one minute more as you hold me under water just one minute more and when i take a friend that saves me and the seats better on the other side i wake up screaming at the news as the reckless worlds collide

turn up tune in turn it upside down this is life this is life i dont wanna know

i took alot of pills i took alot of chances and failed romances i threw my picture away i threw it all in the past life its haunting me this time but in reflection it fails regection my letters returned with your corrections i got alot hear dont wanan hear it.

[chorus]
can we pretend we feel alright one minute more as you hold me under water just one minute more
and when i take the friend that saves me and the seats better on the other side i wake up screaming at the news as the reckless worlds a collide

turn on tune in turn it upside down if this is life this is life i dont wanna know
turn on tune in turn it upside down if this is life this is life i dont wanna know
turn on tune in turn it upside down if this is life this is life i dont wanna know
turn on tune in turn on tune inturn on tune in tune in tune innnn

[chorus]
can we pretend we feel alright for one minute more as you hold me under water just one minute more and when i take the friend that saves me and the seats better on the other side i wake up screaming at the news as the reckless world,

can we let chips burn into our eyes one minute more as you strum my heart strings with a knife one minute more and if i let you make it on the list ill see you on the other side its the color inside of my mind

turn on tune in turn it upside down if this is life this is life i dont wanna know
