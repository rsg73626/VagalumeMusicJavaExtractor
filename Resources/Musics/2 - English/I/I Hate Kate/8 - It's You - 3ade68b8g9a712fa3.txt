IT'S YOU

It's You
Go
Let it go
Let it go
Put it all behind
For you

Show
Let it show
Let it show
That you’re not afraid of this
For you

And there’s only one person I know
That is worth all the time in the world
It’s you

Life
This short life
This sweet life
Is all I've got
I’ve got for you

And there’s only one person I know
That is worth all the time in the world
It’s you
It’s you

It’s you that makes me feel it
You that makes me feel so alive
So alive
It's you
It's you

Born
We were born
We were born in this world of hope
I hope it's you

And there’s only one person I know
That is worth all the time in the world
It’s you
It’s you

It’s you that makes me feel it
You that makes me feel so alive
So alive

It's you
It's you
It’s you that makes me feel it
You that makes me feel so alive
So alive

Don't call off all your feelings
And sew off all your clothes
To forget me
To forget me

All dried up in this weather
Been tied up since forever
So let me
Just let me

It’s you
It’s you
It’s you that makes me feel it
You that makes me feel so alive
So alive

It’s you
It’s you
It’s you that makes me feel it
You that makes me feel so alive
So alive

It’s you
It’s you
It’s you
It’s you
