LOVE ASSOCIATION

When I say love
Tell me what comes to mind
Is it your love to watch me suffer all the time?

When I say regret
Tell me what comes to mind
Is it not scratching out my eyes when you have time?
The time to lie to me, pleasure me, then suffocate me in my sleep
Would you tell me all the things you know I wanna hear?
And lead me to believe

When I say fall
Tell me what comes to mind
Is it October first when we first had the time?
The time to kiss me, miss me, fuck my friends make me naïve
Would you tell me all the things you know I wanna hear?
And lead me to believe

I admit we’re sick and we breathe the chaotic eye
I find the beauty in the comma psychotic
In this universe it goes from bad to worse
Only if you let it
Only if you let it
In this universe it goes from bad to worse
I won’t let it
I won’t let it

When I say complete
Tell me what comes to mind
Is it the kind of life that I could never find?
Would you lie to me, pleasure me, then suffocate me in my sleep
Would you tell me all the things you know I wanna hear?
And lead me to believe

I admit we’re sick and we breathe the chaotic eye
I find the beauty in the comma psychotic
In this universe it goes from bad to worse
Only if you let it
Only if you let it
In this universe it goes from bad to worse
I won’t let it
I won’t let it
