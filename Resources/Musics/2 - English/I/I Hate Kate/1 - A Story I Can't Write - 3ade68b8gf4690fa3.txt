A STORY I CAN'T WRITE

Well, it's been three weekends in a row
That I've been sitting at home
Not going out at all
Sometimes I get the feeling
That's how it's gonna be for the rest of me

It's like a little taste to pass time by
Or a leader who falls and you ask why
I ask why we're here
And you are gone
You are gone
And that's a story I can't write

A story I can't write
A story I can't write
A song I can't sing
A battle that I just can't fight
A story I can't write
A story where you'd be here
You and I
And everyone would know
They'd know it's our world
It's our world
It's our world

Well, sometimes I see some friends around town
Pretend I'm fine and everything's alright
They still talk about bringing it back
And I don't know if I'm down with that

It's like a little taste to pass time by
Or a leader who falls and you ask why
I ask why we're here
And you are gone

You are gone
And that's a story I can't write

A story I can't write
A story I can't write
A song I can't sing
A battle that I just can't fight
A story I can't write
A story where you'd be here
You and I
And everyone would know
They'd know it's our world
It's our world
It's our world
Our world

I can bring you home
Bring you home
And that's a story I can't write

A story I can't write
A story I can't write
A song I can't sing
A battle that I just can't fight
A story I can't write
A story where you'd be here
You and I
And everyone would know
They'd know it's our world

Story I can't write
A battle I can't fight
Story I can't write
A battle I can't fight
