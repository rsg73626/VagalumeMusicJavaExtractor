INSIDE INSIDE

Pretend I'm not alive
Pretend to fall in line
Pretend that you are not pretending
Detached from comprehending
As you sleep alone
As you sleep alone tonight

I feel the urgency
I feel you next to me
I feel that happiness is boring
She's drinking all the chlorine
As I sleep alone
As I sleep alone tonight

On the inside
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
The movie in your mind
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Slow motion suicide
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Is it safe to hide on the inside?

On the inside

The time will pass us by
The time of cheap surprise
The time of reckoning is coming
So spend your whole life running
And don't sleep alone
And don't sleep alone at night

I feel the urgency
I feel you next to me
I feel that happiness is boring
She's drinking all the chlorine
As I sleep alone
As I sleep alone tonight

On the inside
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
The movie in your mind
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Slow motion suicide
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Is it safe to hide on the inside?
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
The movie in your mind
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Slow motion suicide
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Is it safe to hide on the inside?

On the inside
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
The movie in your mind
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Slow motion suicide
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Is it safe to hide on the inside?
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
The movie in your mind
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Slow motion suicide
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Is it safe to hide on the inside?

On the inside

On the inside

On the inside

On the inside
