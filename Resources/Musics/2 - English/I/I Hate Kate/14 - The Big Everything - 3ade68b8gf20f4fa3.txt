THE BIG EVERYTHING

Oh silence silence my friend 
Won’t you ever listen? 
As I wait for you to grow 
Oh violence violence is this 
It’s a sign I can not miss 
As I wait for you to know 

Oh God it feels like 
I’m naked on chemicals in the cold 
Every time I wanna look right into your eyes 
This is what I’m told 

That it’s time to make a move and 
It’s time to break on through 
Echoing inside me 
Is this all that we can do 

It’s time to turn the page 
And it’s time to crush the mold 
I know I can’t wait till tomorrow 
What if there’s no tomorrow 

Underwater she moves under black lights turn blue 
As I wait for you to show 
Who’s the enemy who’s the lie? 
Conversations crucify 
As I wait for you to grow 

Oh God it feels like 
I’m naked on chemicals in the cold 
Every time I wanna look right into your eyes 
This is what I’m told 

That it’s time to make a move and 
It’s time to break on through 
Echoing inside me 
Is this all that we can do 

It’s time to turn the page 
And it’s time to crush the mold 
I know I can’t wait till tomorrow 

It’s time to make a move and 
It’s time to break on through 
Echoing inside me 
Can’t wait till tomorrow 

And it’s time to make a move and 
It’s time to break on through 
Echoing inside me 
Is this all that we can do 

It’s time to turn the page 
And it’s time to crush the mold 
I know I can’t wait till tomorrow 

And it’s time to make a move and 
It’s time to break on through 
Echoing inside me 
Is this all that we can do 

It’s time to turn the page 
And it’s time to crush the mold 
I know I can’t wait till tomorrow 

Time to make a move and 
It’s time to break on through 
Echoing inside me 
Is this all that we can do 

It’s time to turn the page 
And it’s time to crush the mold 
I know I can’t wait till tomorrow 
What if there’s no tomorrow 
No tomorrow
