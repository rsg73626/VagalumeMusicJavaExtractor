THEN YOU KISS

What you're cooking in the kitchen
Is it more of your bitchin' attitude
That you give, that you give, that you give
But I don't want it
I won't have it
Oh, not today

Well I saw you in the city
You were looking really pretty
All your friends, all your friends, all your friends were acting very strangely towards me
You're up to no good
Oh, not today

Pull me from this paranoia

Well you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
Miss then you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
Miss then you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss other boys

You know you make me laugh
You know you make me sick
Telling all my friends that I got a small attention span
That's not what you told me, not what you told me
Not what you told me when you told me you loved me
No, oh, oh

And now we never walked down that street
And we never danced to that beat
And we never bring it down
Down, down, oh like we used to
You're up to no good
Oh, not today

Pull me from this paranoia

Well you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
Miss then you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
Miss then you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss other boys

Is it a girl?
Is it a girl?
Is it a girl?
You're getting under my skin
Is it a girl?
Is it a girl?
Is it a girl?
Fingers pointing back at me no more

Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
Miss then you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
Miss then you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss other boys

Well you lie
Then you kiss, then you kiss
Then you kiss, then you try
Then you miss, then you miss
When you lie
Then you kiss
Then you kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
