OUTTA MY HEAD

Attraction
Traction
More than your reaction
Action to the touch
Imagine, magine you've given up so much

I keep making all the same resolutions
Remaining nameless for the sake of confusion
The future's got me worried about postulation
Get you out of my head, my head, out of my head

There's no word that don't get said that confuse me
Every good intention left to abuse me
Set the world on fire waking up screaming
Get you outta my head, my head, outta my head

Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head
