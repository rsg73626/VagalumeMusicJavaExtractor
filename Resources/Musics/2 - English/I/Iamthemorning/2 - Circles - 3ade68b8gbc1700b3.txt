CIRCLES

Here I lay on the broken glass
It hurts like shapes of past
This is right the way
That I used to say
"please, please calm down

Cause
Nobody hears all the stories and
Nobody hears all the voices and
Nobody hears all the sounds you fear, so
Can you reveal them?"

What if I have disappeared?
What if I have gone forever?
Look at me, am I still here?
Or maybe I have gone forever

Here I lay all the mornings after
And I wonder how did I get there
This is my mistake,
I don't want to take
All the responsibilities and be

Someone who hears all the stories and
Someone who hears all the voices and
Someone who fears all the sounds he hears but
I can't reveal them

What if I have disappeared?
What if I have gone forever?
Look at me, am I still here?
Or maybe I have gone forever, gone forever
