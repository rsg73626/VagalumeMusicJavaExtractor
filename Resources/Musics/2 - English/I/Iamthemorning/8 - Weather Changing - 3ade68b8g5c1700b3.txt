WEATHER CHANGING

Who said
That this is not the answer?
And who said,
That this is not the end?
Well, I say it is,
I say it is.

Who tells you
There is no escapement?
Who tells you
There is nothing left?
Well I say there is,
I say there is.

Can you
Remember your worst nightmare?
Can you
Remember how it was,
To face the fear,
To disappear?

Have you forsaken your desires
Or were you betrayed by your own mind
Prepare for the worst
As it comes and it goes

Cause this is what you'll get here
This is what you take
This is what you take for real
This is where it ends

Our hearts
Are trembling inside,
Trembling inside,
Our hearts,
Like molecules collide
It's time to decide
If our hearts
Prepared to be saved
Or will be betrayed
Our hearts
Are dying inside,
Dying inside
