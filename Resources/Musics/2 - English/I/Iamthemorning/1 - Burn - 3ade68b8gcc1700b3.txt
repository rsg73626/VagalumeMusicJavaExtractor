BURN

Oh, watch how it burns,
How it dies on your eyes
Nice
Oh, what for
Have you done this for their
Lies,
It's so nice

Oh, watch how it burns
How it dies in your eyes
Oh, what for
Have you done this for them?
Watch it disappears
You will never have to hear
How it cries, how it murmurs in your ear

Why are you here?
Why are you
There's nothing left to,
There's nothing to talk about
Why are we here?
How did we get..
There's nothing left to regret and to talk about.
Nothing to talk about

I can tell you
What is really, really going on
I can tell you
Whether things are going right or wrong
I can tell you that sometimes it doesn't feel the same
Nothing's wrong but doesn't feel right.
