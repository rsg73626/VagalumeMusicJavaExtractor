SERENADE

How do you manage to feel?
Do you imply that the pain is appealing?
Quietly crying you are overwhelmed with this feeling
Seems that your burden is real,
Do you believe that it may disappear?
Quietly crying you are more alive with this feeling,
It seems

Things that I've learned
(what a lucky man you are)
Things that I keep burned
(what a desperate world it is, try)
Seems that I've learned
How to escape my burden
Try

It's the first of July,
And the world is cruel, and the cruelty is stable
And there's no need to deny
That I don't want to live in the world like this,
What illogical, desperate world it is,
I don't want to walk all the obscure traces,
See gloomy faces

Things that I've learned
(what a lucky man you are)
Things that I keep burned
(what a desperate world it is, try)
Seems that I've learned
How to escape my burden
Cause this pain is never-ending
Try
