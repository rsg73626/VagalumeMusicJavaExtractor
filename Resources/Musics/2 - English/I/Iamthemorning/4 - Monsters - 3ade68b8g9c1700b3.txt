MONSTERS

When the mirror breaks
Take another chance to try again and leave the rest
And then you count mistakes
You see other ways
To escape your fate and still remain unconscious nonetheless

Behind your mask
Your face is hidden
But I see what's inside you
Within yourself
You realize, my dear
Your inner monster's what you fear

And this is where it ends
You got to think of what to say before you fall asleep
Will you cry for help?
Will you blame the others who closed your eyes and left you?
Easily let you fall apart?

Within yourself
You are the monster
Within ourselves we all are
Within yourself
You are the monster
Within ourselves we all are

Monsters are here,
They're not under your bed, they're near
Monsters are here, inside you

Within yourself
You are the monster
Within ourselves we all are
Within yourself
You realize, my dear
Your inner monster's what you fear
