WOULD THIS BE

Would this be my only way
When I fall through the memories
When I fall through the hollow of loss and disgrace
Is the only way to erase?
Would this be
My only one
Right choice
So that I escape
From the toss of the world
So that I put a cross on it's grave
It's all in my head
Though I can feel tha pain
I can feel the rain falling down
It's all in my head
Though I can feel the shame
For going back in the rain
That keeps falling on my head
That keeps falling on my head
That keeps falling on my head

Rain that keeps falling down
Rain that keeps falling down
