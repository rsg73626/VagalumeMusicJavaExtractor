SCOTLAND

Are you here?
And do you still hear my voice?
And who is out?
Are you out?

Are you here?
Are you hanging in between
In or out?
In or out?

Are you here?
And do you still hear my voice?
And who is out?
And who is out?

I'm pleased to hear
I'm pleased to see your presence near
Do not go out
Do not go out

It's not that I've been rejected
It's not that I've searched for truth
But I see you being affected
By outside spirits I disapprove
Becoming closer you can't see further
Becoming nearer you can't defend
I see that you are becoming colder
There's nothing really outside
