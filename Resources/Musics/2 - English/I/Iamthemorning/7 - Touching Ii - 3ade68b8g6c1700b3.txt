TOUCHING II

Before I forget
The only thing I have
What will you tell me to make me stay?
Before I throw away
The only thing I have,
Then what will you tell me to make me stay?
If there is a meaning in things we do,
Then where can I and how can I find the clue?
If there is a meaning in things we do, then
Where can I and how can I find

Who touches and why touch,
Who touches the sky above us?
