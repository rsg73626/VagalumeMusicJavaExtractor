TERRE D'ORU (FEAT. STING)

You'll remember me
When the west wind moves
Upon the fields of Barley
Di u sole fieru
Ti ne scurderai
Caminendu in terre d'oru

So she took her love
For to gaze a while
Upon the fields of Barley
È d'una carezza
Si sò strinti à pena
Mezu à quelle terre d'oru

Will you stay with me
Will you be my love
Among the fields of Barley
Di u sole fieru
Ci ne scurderemu
Una notte in terre d'oru

See the west wind moves
Like a lover so
Upon the fields of Barley
Ci sarà l'amore
Nantu à e so labbre
Mezu à quelle terre d'oru

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I have broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in the fields of gold
We'll walk in the fields of gold

Many years have passed
Since those summer days
Among the fields of Barley
È issi zitellucci
Mentre u sole ciotta
Mezu à quelle terre d'oru

You'll remember me
When the west wind moves
Upon the fields of Barley

You can tell the sun
In his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
D'una volta in terre d'oru
When we walked in the fields of gold ...
