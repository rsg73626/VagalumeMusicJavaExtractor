RIVER

I've held up one too many throwaways,
Done things that tell me always, keep distance from the river.
I grew up with no sense of anywhere,
With people that will always be swept up in the river.

At least if I go, take me over, that river.
At least if I go, take me over, that river.

Made a deal with the devil, who made a deal with the undead.
You made a deal with the devil, now my cards are all red.
You made a threat with the blackmail, 
you made a deal with guns instead.
You made a deal with the devil, and my cards are all red.
You took a stab in the dark sun; you told a lie to save your head.
You made a deal with the devil, and my cards are all red.

Dump me in the river, tie a brick to me.
Dump me in the river, tie a brick to me.
Dump me in the river, tie a brick to me.
Dump me in the river, tie a brick to me.
