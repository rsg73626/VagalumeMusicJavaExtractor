STREET SCENE

You didn't know -
Look out!
This is paradise.
Life-long show -
Get up!
And I will meet you where it is....
Real low.

As good as gold -
Cry out!
Waste is still devised,
Who know the scene?
Break loose!
Or keep on livin' like a Chimpanzee.

All to the streets,
Alright now beat your feet
Speak load, it should be said
That I'm young but I'm already dead.
