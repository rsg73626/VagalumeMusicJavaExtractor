GIVE'M A HAND

Hey man you ain't got no money
Hey man I'm a broke like you
God damn, you're livin' like a convict
But this con's collar is blue...

Yeah, his collar is blue

Twelve hours, singin' with the chain gang
Twelve hours, fightin' on the line
Run down, battered and bloody
Without a doubt, all out of time

Dyin' at dawn, Dyin' at dawn
Gettin' up payin' them dues
Dyin' at dawn
Diggin' a ditch, Diggin' a ditch
Breakin' your back, goin' insane
Diggin' a ditch
Drained all day, Drained all day
Slowing you down, drowning you out
Drained all day
Death at dusk, Death at dusk
Give him a hand, he never complains
Death at Dusk

Hey man you ain't got no money
Hey man I'm a broke like you
God damn, you're livin' like a convict
But this con's collar is blue...
