SKELETON DANCE

Smell you soul it curbs the appetite.
Bed of nails, how'd you sleep last night?
You make me,
You break me,
Your blade always shines.
You hold my neck upon it while I'm bleeding in time.

Skeleton dance
How is it workin' in hell?

Long knives
Surround you
No mas, no more can't take this and I
Never learned a thing from you.

One step closer, gone
That's the way it goes.
Where's my stop man?
I don't know.
Is it right here or right on?
It ends all the same -
In a box that's six feet under,
Where the worms pick your brain.

Skeleton dance
How is it workin' in hell?

Long knives
Surround you
No mas, no more can't take this and I
Never learned a thing from you.

Long knives
Surround you
No mas, no more can't take this and I
Know I got a job to do...

And maybe you will find,
That baby, I'm alive...
Keep on feeding me them knives.
Just stick 'em real deep
Or carve me up like meat,
Either way, I think you're doin' fine.
