RIOT IN THE NEON LIGHT

I got a light to light the way
And though it's in my soul it says
We can't tomorrow, we must today

We've got to keep moving on
We've got to move the night is young
We work overtime but we won't get paid

Whoa, tell me that my heart was in my hand
An entire sound that is coming through my head

We've got to keep on moving on
We've got to move the night is young
Our hearts, on fire, will light the way

A riot in the neon light
The guns all fire into the night
They're coming for blood but they won't get any

You have been on the mountainside
â€˜Neath cold black desert sky
That covers you on the mountainside
Where the sun will never shine
