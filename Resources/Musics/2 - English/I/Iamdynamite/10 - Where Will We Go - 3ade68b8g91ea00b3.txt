WHERE WILL WE GO

She asked me what my name was
I said I've got no name
And though she knew the answer,
She asked me once again.

I said I got no questions
Under the bright blue sky
I know that I could tell you something
and I'll tell you why.

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
I've got no bright idea
Where we'll go this time

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea where we go
I don't know
till the last good time

And all my friends they come to me
They say "you're gonna die boy, better believe it"
I said so it's just like this
Take your time and when you get there
Grab the fire and grab the matches
People on the loose and they never catch us
I'm gonna tell ‘em just like this
Take their time and when they get there

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
I've got no bright idea
Where we'll go this time

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea where we go
I don't know
till the last good time

And all my friends they come to me
They say "you're gonna die boy, better believe it"
I said so it's just like this
Take your time and when you get there
Grab the fire and grab the matches
People on the loose and they never catch us
I'm gonna tell ‘em just like this
Take their time and when they get there

Hey, I don't mind (4x)

Whoa (16x)

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
I've got no bright idea
Where we'll go this time

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea where we go
I don't know
till the last good time

And all my friends they come to me
They say "you're gonna die boy, better believe it"
I said so it's just like this
Take your time and when you get there

She asked me what my name was
I said I've got no name
And though she knew the answer,
She asked me once again
