HEY GIRL

Anywhere we go,
They'll be pumping it through on the radio
Anywhere we go,
They'll be there in our room so we're not alone

And anywhere we go,
All our friends will believe it but we'll know that they're wrong
And anywhere we go,
We could try to fit in, but we will never belong

Hey girl
Oh, the world that I could tell
Oh that sound,
It's getting close we better get down
Oh, The world that I could tell

Anywhere we go,
They'll be pumping it through on the radio
Anywhere we go,
They'll be there in our room so we're not alone

And anywhere we go,
All our friends will believe, but we'll know that they're wrong
And anywhere we go,
We could try to fit in, but we'll never belong
And anywhere we go, we will run
And anywhere we go, we will run

Anywhere we want to, 
We would tell you
If the old man knows if I was 
Anybody's asking, 
we would tell them
Id the old man knows if I was
