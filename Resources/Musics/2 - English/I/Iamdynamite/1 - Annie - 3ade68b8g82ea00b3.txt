ANNIE

Annie my love, won't you come back?

I guess it's all been a lie
Last night the moon was high
And the twinkling in your eye
Gave you away

Another day
Another mess that we have made
No water will wash the stain
Never again, it's up to me my friend

Annie my love won't you come back?

Still
I guess I'd like to feel
Just an ounce of heart
But I don't knowâ€¦

So here we go
Out there, the wind it blows
Howling, full of ghosts
Take me away
Come take me away

Annie my love, won't you come back?

Annie my love I swear that I will
Recall my favorite places I will 
Recall my favorite places I will
Yeah I've been underneath it all
