Miss Jones
What have you done?
Seen you standing over your son
Now stand aside and keep a lookout
For the father when he comes

I said Hey, alright
Bobby, come outside
Light a fire
Keep it burning high
Dig a grave
For the poor child who's
Mother's left 
Us for a while

What she want is what she get
And what she get is what she want

Mama,
What would you say, if you had not passed away?
I still see your face when I close my eyes and pray
