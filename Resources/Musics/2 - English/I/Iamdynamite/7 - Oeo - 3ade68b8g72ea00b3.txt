OEO

No time to celebrate
It's hard to meditate
When all I've got is some paper money, and a big fat Cuban cigar to burn

I'm out there on the dance floor
I can't dance much when I'm feeling sore
Fell in love with disco queen that'd been loved too much before

Woke up this morning, grabbed my gun
Told my mama what I had done
