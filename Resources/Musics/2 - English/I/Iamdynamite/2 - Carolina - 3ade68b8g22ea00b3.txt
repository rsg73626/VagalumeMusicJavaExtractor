CAROLINA

Oh Carolina, where you been?
I've been down in the desert callin'
Though I know I ain't no saint I promise you dear
We'll be together again

Stood by the grave of my dear friend
Then I went to the church and the preacher was there
You know that preacher said to me
“Son you better be scared, this is God's land”

We were standing there like a freight train coming and
We don't even care
We were swaying to the sound like a back door swinging and 
We don't even care

Say what you will
My heart on the floor
Down, following down
