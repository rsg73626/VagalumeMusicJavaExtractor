STEREO

I was blinded staring at the sun
I was tortured but it felt so good 
And as I lay awake tonight
Kept alive by the pouring of the moonlight

Here's the devil coming up to me
Said “you look like a friend in need”
I said “I've got some things to say…”
As he listened he began to sing

Turn off the lights and turn on the stereo

I know we fall, I know we burn
She died in the bedroom of the last man's son
And so we fall and so we burn
She died in the bedroom of the last man's son

So a mighty wind began to blow
Taking all not bolted to the floor
And as my heart began to fear
Up came wind, screamin in my ear

Turn off the lights and turn on the stereo
