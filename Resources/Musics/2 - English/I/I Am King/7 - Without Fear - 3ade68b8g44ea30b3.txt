WITHOUT FEAR

No longer you will have to be afraid
I'm here to guide you
Here to show you the way

They're plotting against us
This blood is on your hands
They're plotting against us
We speak of brotherhood
It's just another trend
From the begining our humanity
Has signified the end
We are a nation of whores!
Selling ourselves
Selling ourselves

This is the last time that i'm not
Giving in to letting go
Why can't I see
The light in front of me
Why can't I let this go

Let the rain pour down
And let this feeling take hold
We've lost control
We've lost control
Nothingness
We will all dissolve into nothingness
Nothingness

Into nothingness
We all fade
Nothing you can do will make this go away
So tell me why are you afraid?
So tell me why are you afraid?
The time for us to change is now!
So let nothing stand in our way
It's time to let your demons out
And let the light wash them away

This is the last time that i'm not
Giving in to letting go
Why can't I see
The light in front of me
Why can't I let this go

This isn't over
It's just begun
With hearts like black diamond
We run
Ask yourself what you believe
Because the man behind the mask
Is pulling us back in!
