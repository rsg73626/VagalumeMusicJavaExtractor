TELL ME THE TRUTH

Something doesn't fell right
I can't sleep
I keep tossing and turning
And I'm dying in my dreams
I know it's there
I feel it like a splinter in my mind
It's almost like a nightmare
But I'm not waking up this time

Am I the only one
Who thinks that we are only going
Backwards from the place we need to be?
And I will find my way
If you could just trust me
Maybe I could show you
I'm not the crazy one

Retrace the steps and pick up the pieces
Both yours and mine together we can find
That in a broken sort of way
Everything is perfect here
I feel it in my bones and I'm not sure
That we can make this out alive
Oh baby, not this time

The further away from where I was
The harder things become for me
Who am I now without a world whispering in my ear?
The son rises high in the sky but
The clouds of our past are all blocking
The light from shining through

Am I the only one
Who thinks that we are only going
Backwards from the place we need to be?
And I will find my way
If you could just trust me
Maybe I could show you
I'm not the crazy one

Retrace the steps and pick up the pieces
Both yours and mine together we can find that... (2x)

So tell me the truth when you look out your window
Do you think that everything is ok?

Am I the only one
(Think for yourself)
Who thinks that we are only going
(With your heart)
Backwards from the place we need to be?
(Your mind, your soul)
And I will find my way
If you could just trust me
Maybe I could show you
I'm not the crazy one
