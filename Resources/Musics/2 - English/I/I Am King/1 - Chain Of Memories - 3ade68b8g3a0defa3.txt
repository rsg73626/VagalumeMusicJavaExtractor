CHAIN OF MEMORIES

Tell me why we have to be so selfish
In the way we think
And in the way we breathe
Aren't we better than our machines?
Our hearts have turned to stone
We walk away from everything we've known

We build our lives on these moments
And haven't you noticed that it's never enough?
They left you scarred and broken
Now that your eyes are open
Hold on tight
(hold on tight)
Tight

I wish you could feel waht I've felt
And see what I've seen
As the colors of this life
(blend before me)
If I could turn back time
I'd tear down that tree
That separates the love
In front of you and me

There I see you standing at the edge
Trying so hard
(trying so hard)
To find our remedy
We need to find the answers
Despite the questions you perceive
(you perceive)

And I have come to find and realize
I can do nothing about the way we live our live
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one
And this has just begun
The sky is crying for the son
Can you feel me?

I wish you could feel waht I've felt
And see what I've seen
As the colors of this life
(blend before me)
If I could turn back time
I'd tear down that tree
That separates the love
In front of you and me

This is the side of me I never wanted to see
I tried to fight it off
The roots are taking hold of me
We put on these blindfolds so willingly
This is the side of me I never wanted to see
