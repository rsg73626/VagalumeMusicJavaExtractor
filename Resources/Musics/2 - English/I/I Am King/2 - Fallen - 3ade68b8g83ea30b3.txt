FALLEN

Though your mouth did smile
your eyes proclaimed
I could see through your heart
you didn't feel the same
You should have learned how to lie
learned from the best
learned from me
?Cause when you told me the truth
baby it killed me

I traced a figure eight in the sand there where we laid
as you looked into my eyes and said forever and always
I still lose my sanity from the mistake I made that day
when I reflected in your eyes and said forever and always

If I could only wish you away
erase the memory of your ghost
Did we ever even happen?
Was I ever welcome in your home?

A slow dance with a gruesome romance 
that made time stand still
You swore you'd never forget me
but I'll make sure you never fucking will
These days it's so hard not to notice me

If I could only wish you away
erase the memory of your ghost
Did we ever even happen?
Was I ever welcome in your home?
You should have learned how to lie
learned from the best
learned from me
?Cause when you told me the truth
baby it killed me

Where my dreams once stood
now lies the cynics of a bitter man before you
Now that I've become all the things I hate
I'm free to live my life in this prison 
and just take, take, take it all
I lost myself in the light
but found myself in the dark
If you come close
I swear I'll tear you apart

If it's a wound that never heals
then it's a love that never fades
Baby you're the greatest mistake I've ever made
So tell me how?
How can it be?
So many suns have set, yet it's only you I see

If I could only wish you away
erase the memory of your ghost
Did we ever even happen?
Was I ever welcome in your home?
You should have learned how to lie
learned from the best
learned from me
?Cause when you told me the truth
baby it killed me

Though your mouth did smile
your eyes proclaimed
I could see through your heart
you didn't feel the same
