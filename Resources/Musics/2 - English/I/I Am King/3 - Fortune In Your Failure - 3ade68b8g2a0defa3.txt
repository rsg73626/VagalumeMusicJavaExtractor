FORTUNE IN YOUR FAILURE

The tides of man crash upon the rocks of relativity
Creating delusions of grandeur
I can't understand her
She's gone where I cannot follow
And she picks out my insides
Twisting, contorning her way in
While her mask of deception is painted by our sins
(I have eaten of the world)

I'm not asking for a second chance,
I just want you to make what you need me to be

Face yourself for time is an illusion
Tomorrow we die in vain
You've been misled
You are so hopeless and easily led
Break down these walls with truth

I'm not asking for a second chance,
I just want you to make what you need me to be
I won't bend, I won't break
For I'm saved by your grace, and your love
It overwhelms me

Destroy, create, rebuild! (2x)

I will not take part in this depravity
This blood belongs in my body,
You'll never take it from me
(take it from me)

Destroy, create, rebuild! (2x)

Close your eyes and find the fortune in your failure
And swallow your pride
And dig deep inside
To find the piece in the storm
(that is your life)
Destroy, create, rebuild!

I'm not asking for a second chance,
I just want you to make what you need me to be
I won't bend, I won't break
For I'm saved by your grace, and your love
It overwhelms me
