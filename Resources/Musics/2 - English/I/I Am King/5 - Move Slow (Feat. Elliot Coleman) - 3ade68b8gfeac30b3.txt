MOVE SLOW (FEAT. ELLIOT COLEMAN)

Sometimes, it's like the air after midnight
Is a little bit harder for me to breathe
Sometimes, I just need a little bit of time
To find some piece of mind
Sometimes, I just need you to move it
Nice and slow for me

Because I am only a man who crumbles
And fades as the weight of the world takes it's toll on me
And right now I need your touch
Will you be my sanity?

Move slow
Like the seasons take time to change
I know what it takes to make you shake
So come close cuz I know that you feel the same
I know that you feel the same

I feel your breath on my skin
Your heart's paper thin
But that won't stop you no
You want to feel what's wrong
Girl you know I'm right
Baby, don't pretend to fight me
On this fake love here tonight

Let the clocks melt from these walls
As we lose ourselves in something
That we make believe is real
If only for a moment suspended in night

Move slow
Like the seasons take time to change
I know what it takes to make you shake
So come close cuz I know that you feel the same
I know that you feel the same

I've got this feeling deep inside
It's getting hard to fight
Lets not fight
Close your eyes
And closer
So baby
Don't you be afraid
Lose yourself tonight
Lose yourself tonight

Come close
Let the walls begin to quake
I feel your heart beating faster with every move you make
Don't be afraid
Lose yourself in me tonight

Move slow
Like the seasons take time to change
I know what it takes to make you shake
So come close cuz I know that you feel the same
I know that you feel the same
