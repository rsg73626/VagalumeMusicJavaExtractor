SONG 1

Now i'm so lonely
you've gone and turned this way
now i'm so lonely
you've gone and turned this way
i thought to myself
what you have done to me
i thought to myself
what you have done to me
if only god could take my own life
i don't think i, will have any use for it
and i would say everything's not ok
i don't think you will have any use for me
now i'm so lonely
you've gone and turned this way
now i'm so lonely
you've gone and turned this way
everything's crazy don't ever turn away
