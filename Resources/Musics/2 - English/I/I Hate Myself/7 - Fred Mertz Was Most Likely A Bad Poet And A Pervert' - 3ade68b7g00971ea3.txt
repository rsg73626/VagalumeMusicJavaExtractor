FRED MERTZ WAS MOST LIKELY A BAD POET AND A PERVERT'

oh! she looks trodden upon in the most prettiest way,
in the most funniest gray.
red, red hair. faded red underwear.
is it red under there? is it red under there?
lucy; my, my. lucy; my, my.
I'm losing my mind..losing my mind.
you laugh when i cry; lucy..my,my.
