SONG FOR ALL THE YOUNG CASANOVAS AND CASNOVETTES

i suggest you only ever tell lies.
because once you tell the truth they'll break your heart.
don't ever look them in the eyes.
because those eyes are gonna rip your heart apart.
i recommend you keep your distance,
becuase once you get too close, you'll lose control.
don't ever fall in love; just stay buried in your lonely hole.
take it from experience: desperate acts are ridiculous.
