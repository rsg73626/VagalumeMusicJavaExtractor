MORE THAN JUST A MAN

I can hear it fading, looking at the streets..
Crawling in the silence of my soul's abyss
Become alive again by a little misbehave
Tired of the game of these hipocryts..

I grow tired of been alone for far to long
They rip my heart but now they never do again 
No more
release
My soul
And let me scream
I have
Become
More then just a man.

Will you ever find me
Will you do someday
gonna make you anxious
Gonna make you stay.
I'll fit your dreams girl
I'll crush your game...

Lets make this loud girl
Let's forget our shame..

I grow tired of been alone for far to long.
They rip my heart but now they never do again no more.
release my soul and let me scream
I have become more then just a man.
