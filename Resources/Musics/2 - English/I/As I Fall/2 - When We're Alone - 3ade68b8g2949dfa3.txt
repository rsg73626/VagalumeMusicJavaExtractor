WHEN WE'RE ALONE

She seems so lonely when i find her.
Like a wanderer, just like me.
I've whispered my name then she smile at me.
I've showed i care the way i know.

When her eyes started to shine at me
I start to press her soul against the wall
So surreal we can barely breath
She shows she care the way she knows.

Clothes flying
Desire fill the room
The door is closed we dont care how we are!

Bring me closer
Show me how you see
The world around when we're alone.

The world around when we're alone...

The orange light of the streets seems so bright
we will run from the light as we purchase the night...
When we're togheter and our...

Clothes flying
Desire fill the room
The door is closed we dont care how we are!

Bring me closer
Show me how you see
The world around when we're alone.

You Motherfucker want to cage us just to stare..
I dare you to try man, really i dont care...
I give you all my best so you can rest assured
That i will free myself and Then consumes you...

Clothes flying
Desire fill the room
The door is closed we dont care how we are!

Bring me closer
Show me how you see
The world around when we're alone.
