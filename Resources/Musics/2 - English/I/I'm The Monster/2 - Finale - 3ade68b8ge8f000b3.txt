FINALE

Replace my broken body parts
And put pieces back together with anything
To make us whole again
Replace my nerves with wiring
I'll swap my heart with a driving beat
Unlike before with this new body
I can see clearly

Oh I can see clearly

To keep this song from stopping
(Let's just go, let's just go)
Everyone's on to something
(I'll meet you there)
The news streams over the radio
(Loud and clear, loud and clear)
If I'm to come around I'll burn this down
I'll burn this down
