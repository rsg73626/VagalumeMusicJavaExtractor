THE LOCK

I hear cars stopping by, and the people coming in
I can't see any of them,
Between the pauses and coughs are heavy breathing
I'm sitting here in silence,
My heart is sinking deeper inside of me
And the air I'm breathing is getting caught in my throat
And I think I might be breaking down

My mouth is dry, I'm overcome with the weight of the world
And I have misleading hopes that you will drive up
Oh this can't be real
Oh this can't be real

If only I can find a way to keep you here with me
Give me the time and place, I'll find a way to meet you there

I'll meet you there
Give me the time and place, I'll find a way to meet you there

I'll meet you there
