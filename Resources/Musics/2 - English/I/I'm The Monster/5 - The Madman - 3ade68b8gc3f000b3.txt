THE MADMAN

It's the way my leg shakes to the click
Of the gears in the clock
I'm staring into the future but I can't see
Past the sea of constant tapping

You can tell me to let it go
But you know it's not that easy!

It's the sound of pacing footsteps
Echoing through the hall right up to my throat
As it catches the flaunting of her hair
And he's mouthing all the right words

You can tell me to let it go
But you know it's not that easy!

Breathe in slowly counting backwards down to one
More pill ill take to bring me up and out of this
Breathe in slowly
Breathe in slowly

So what's it gonna take?
To keep this frantic beating, from beating out of my chest

You know I can help you, you're safe here with me
I want to get to know you a little better now
Forget what you've been told because they're a bunch of liars
Tell me who, tell me who gets you better than I?

Stop with all the talking! the talking!
It makes me want to scream out loud and let the whole world know
And let the whole world know that they mean nothing!

Breathe in slowly counting backwards down to one...
Breathe in slowly! Breathe in slowly...
