THE SCRAP POET

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
Like it matters now you're free, its lost its hold on me

Please tell me what I want to hear
Wake up, wake up!
Your moment's here
Please tell me what I want to hear

So what happens now?
Be honest with yourself
Where do I fit in?
Don't look back, don't look back now
I feel like I've been caught under dressed
The unimpressive me, oh the unimpressive me
If I start going through the motions what will be left?

Please tell me what I want to hear
Don't give up right now, you're better off without it

What happens now?
What's happening, what's happening?
Where am I, why is he still here
Who's here?
Just tell me what I want to hear

Please tell me what I want to hear
Don't give up right now
Please tell me what I want to hear
Because it's over now
It's over now
