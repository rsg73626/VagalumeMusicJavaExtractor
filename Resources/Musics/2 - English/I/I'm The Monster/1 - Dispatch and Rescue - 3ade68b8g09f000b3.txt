DISPATCH AND RESCUE

Sleepless, the clouded mind
I can't see anything
But your broken face match your falling star
I'm colder than the ice caps, but you're melting
Melting away

Dispatcher on the line
I'm on it who needs rescue?
Where falling stars go to die
We'll need back up
We'll need back up

Follow the tail lights right back to the street
Where we grew up with intentions to light up our streets
If only we could focus,
Oh we've lost focus,
Don't lose focus, or you'll never make it out alive

Dispatcher's on the line
