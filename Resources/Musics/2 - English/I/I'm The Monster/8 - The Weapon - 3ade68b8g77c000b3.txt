THE WEAPON

Don't quit I think he's alive!

You've got your medic team on a stand by
And the latest news is going live on the air,
I've got a million questions for you better focus now
While this barrel's in your mouth

You better make this count
You better make this count

(I've got a million questions for you better focus now)
(While this barrel's in your mouth)
Oh what a nerve you've got
Who are you, who are you to tell me anything
If I'm to come around I'll burn this town
I'll burn it into the ground,
If I'm to come around I'll burn this down
Until you both go down with me

Don't quit I think he's alive!

Is that what you call an answer?!
Why can't you realize?
That what! you stitched him up and left his engine to die!
Keep this up and you'll never be able to move on
Move on!

So is this what its come down to?
Reduced to simple words?
Words that could never describe you,
We've got a flat line!
Stop giving up!
Please give me something to hold on to
Your medic terms they cut it close
To my heart to your throat

Just wait I think he's alive!
