START AGAIN

Woke up sad
When am I ever gonna learn?
It's in my head
But I can't say the words 
I had it in my hands
Lost my nerve
Gave it and I got it
In return
One day
I'll come around
Wonder when
I'll turn around
And start again
My fingerprints
Have left their traces
On all the things
The people and the places
I ever felt
And felt a part of
I touched the life
And kissed the heart of
One day
I'll come around
Wonder when
I'll turn around
And start again
Nothing dies
Nothing ever dies
Woke up sad
When am I ever gonna learn?
It's in my head
Time to take my turn
I had it in my hands
Lost my nerve
Gave it and I got it
In return
One day
I'll come around
Wonder when
I'll turn around
And start again
Wonder when...
