POTS OF GOLD

I'm gonna roll down the mountain
I tried so hard to climb
And choose a different ambition
This time

One by one goes everyone
In search of little pots of gold
When each little pot is gone
They look for something else to hold
Heads in the sand
Sinking sand

I'm gonna jump in that fountain
And drink it 'til it's dry
'Til all that I've been missing
Is mine

One by one goes everyone
Believe it all, we're taught and told
The human race in the marketplace
I'll be bought and you'll be sold
Heads in the sand
Sinking sand

Don't tell me that you're happy
No-one's happy with themselves
We all want to be somebody
Somebody else

Pots of gold...
