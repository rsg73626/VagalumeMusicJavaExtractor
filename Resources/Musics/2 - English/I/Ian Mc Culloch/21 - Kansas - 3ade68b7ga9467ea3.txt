Coming up
Coming into view
Come and see what I've become
I'm saving up my souvenirs for you
You can take them when I'm gone

Where I'm heading I can't tell
Down to Heaven
Or up to Hell
And if who we are is who we love
Then who put all this hate inside me?
And if who we are is written in the stars
When's someone gonna come and find me? 

I'm growing up
Growing into me
Knowing now where I come from
I'm going back, going back to see
How going right could go so wrong.

Where I'm heading I can't tell
Down to Heaven
Or up to Hell
And if who we are is who we love
Then who put all this hate inside me?
And if who we are is written in the stars
When's someone gonna come and find me?

Where the jewels will be revealed
Where the jewels the river gives in the pool where we live
In the glow of shadows magic waters flow

Burning up
Burning up inside
I don't want to feel the cold
I'm turning 'round
Turning 'round to find
All that glitter turned to gold
Where I'm heading I can't tell
Not to Heaven
And not to Hell
And if who we are is who we love
Then who put all this hate inside me?
And if who we are is written in the stars
When's someone gonna come and find me?
