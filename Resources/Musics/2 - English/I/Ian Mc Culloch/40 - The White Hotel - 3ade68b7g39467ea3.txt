THE WHITE HOTEL

I want to be on that white-capped mountain peak
Above the lake, above my station
A moving carriage
The perfect marriage
Of life apart from destination 

Ringing all the bells 
Down at the white hotel 
Tonight

I want to write the letters of persecution
To someone I don't know who doesn't know me
I want to be the dust inside a vacuum
An ice cube frozen in the melting sea

Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Tonight...
