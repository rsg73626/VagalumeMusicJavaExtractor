DAMNATION

Got my suit of armor on
Trynna find some kind of meaning
A peg to hang a hope upon
Something real to stop me dreaming
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
And thinking starts me feeling 

Damn damnation
Damn damn nation
Damn damnation
Damn damn nation

Snowflakes on the oven top
Drumbeats in the wild blue yonder
Didn't hear the penny drop
Shenendoah I'm doomed to wonder
I'm hoping
I'm hoping
No more no longer

Damn damnation
Damn damn nation
Damn damnation
Damn damn nation

Got my ticket to the game
Bullets in a darkened chamber
Every one a different frame
Each an old familiar danger
I'm changing
I'm changing
No more the stranger

Damn damnation
Damn damn nation
Damn damnation
Damn damn nation
Damn damn
Nation
