SHE SINGS (ALL MY LIFE)

It's over; she's certain
The lies that they told her just made her feel older
She's running; her time is coming
It's over; she's certain
A bargain's been struck now
She knows that her luck is changing 

She sings
All my life
Must I wait all my life?
Why does it take all my life?
When is it coming?
When is it coming?
When is it coming?

She's lying in darkness and silence
The radio's playing
She lies there praying to no one
Saying to no one

She sings
All my life
Must I wait all my life?
Why does it take all my life?
When is it coming?
When is it coming?
When is it coming?

She sings
Do do do do doot do doot do do
It's over; she's certain
The lies that they told her just made her feel colder
She's running; her time is coming

She sings
All my life
Must I wait all my life?
Why does it take all my life?
When is it coming?
When is it coming?
When is it coming?
