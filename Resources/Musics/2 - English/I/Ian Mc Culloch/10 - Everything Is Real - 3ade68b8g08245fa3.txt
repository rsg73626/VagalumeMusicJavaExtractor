EVERYTHING IS REAL

Don't try to hide, don't try to run
We can and shall overcome
Never conceal but don't you reveal
What you think and believe

Nothing lasts forever
Everything is real...

Blow up balloons, blow up the world
It's the same old heartache
Just as I thought, it just goes to show
I wish I knew then, 'cos now I know

Nothing lasts forever
Everything is true...

Oh God, where am I now?...
