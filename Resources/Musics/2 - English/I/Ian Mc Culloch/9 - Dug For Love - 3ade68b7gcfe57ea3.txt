DUG FOR LOVE

Lost horizons and tomorrows
Disappeared along the way
Led me on and on
I followed up
Got sent to yesterday
Leaves are falling down from Heaven
Autumn in the auburn skies
One and one and five is seven
One and one and three is five 

All my love
Buried it deep and you dug it up
All my love
Buried it deep and you dug it up

Destination: life and living
Use the privilege of birth
All you need is all you know is
All you'll get is all you're worth
Dot-to-dot I'll take what's given
Golden apples of the sun
Forbid
For bitten
Ending that just begun
Just begun...

All my love
Buried it deep and you dug it up
All my love
Buried it deep and you dug it up
All your love
Buried it deep and you dug it up

All my love
All your love…


Looking for the piece to put me together
Link the link, link the chain
Time for the priest, for the man for all weather
Never ever ever gonna think it again
Leave me all the scrapings from the dregs of Heaven
Just don't leave me waiting at the gates of hell
Only wanna go where the great are heading
Between the falling and the fully felled

All my love
Buried it deep and you dug it up…
All my love
All your love...
