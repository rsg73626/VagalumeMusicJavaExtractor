FEAR OF THE KNOWN

When the night descends because of you
And the darkness is your point of view
Loneliness belongs only to you
Nothing is the only thing to do

Fear of the known
Walking the pavement

When the road's a voyage you can't make
And the role's a part you've had to fake
When godliness has sucked away your hope
And hopelessness is hanging by a rope

When will it happen?
How does it end?
Never to happen
Ever again

Fear of the known
Walking the pavement
Fear of the known
Slipping and sliding

Loneliness belongs only to you
Nothing is the only thing to do

When will it happen?
How does it end?
Never to happen
Ever again
