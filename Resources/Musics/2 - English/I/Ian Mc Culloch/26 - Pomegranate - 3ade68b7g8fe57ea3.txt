POMEGRANATE

On one
Stretching dimensions
My brain so full of tension
And things I cannot mention
That got me on my knees 

Far forgone
Along with my conclusions
That came with much confusion
And led to my delusion
But got me on my way
Got me on my way...

Yes
And the world fell down
When the moon was blue
And you wore a crown
And the word was true

Stop it
Don't live in the gutter
Spread your bread with butter
Enunciate don't stutter
And think before you say

Drop it
String it up and eat it
Be so glad to meet it
Turn around and greet it
Make sure you get your wayâ€¦

Yes
And the world fell down
When the moon was blue
And you wore a crown
And the word was true
True...
