IN BLOOM

Think twice
And do it
Stale life
Don't chew it
Cloud lands
Fog reason
Blue skies
Wrong season 
So soon
Vanishing days
Perfume
Of old bouquets
Rice fields
Feet soaking
Minefields
Here's hoping
So soon
Vanishing days
Perfume
Of old bouquets
In bloom...
Think twice
And do it
Stale life
Don't chew it
Cloud lands
Fog reason
Blue skies
Wrong season
So soon
Vanishing days
Perfume
Of dead bouquets
In bloom..
