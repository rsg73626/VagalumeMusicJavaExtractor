ARTHUR

Fill the skies with stars of wonder
And don't you cry
I don't like it like that
Fill my dreams with love forever
And I'll believe
I'll believe in all that 

Live and die with me
Live and die with me
What I wouldn't give now love?
What I wouldn't give now
What I wouldn't give now love?
What I wouldn't give now, now now

Fill my life with moons and moonlight
And shine up my nights
Yeah, I like it like that

Live and die with me
Live and die with me
What I wouldn't give now love?
What I wouldn't give now
What I wouldn't give now love?
What I wouldn't give now, now now

Fill the skies with stars of wonder
And don't you cry
I don't like it like that
Don't like it like that
