PROUD TO FALL

Here you come again
Acting like a saviour
There you go again
Talking like a stranger
You said we all must learn to face
What we're becoming
And then I saw you in the distance
Off and running 

But from start to finish
I was proud to fall
And I fell so deep within it
I got lost inside it all
Inside it all
Inside it all

Looks like rain again
Feels like it's rained forever
Can't remember when
Don't remember whether
I ever really told you who I was
It must have been because because
Because

From start to finish
I was proud to fall
And I fell so deep within it
I got lost inside it all 
Inside it all
Inside it all

I fell between the bruises
And the red curtain call
I prayed you'd light the fuses
And we'd burn and torch it all

Long day's journey into
Long night's journey out
Knee-deep, so deep within you
I kept and keep without

You said we all must learn to face
What we're becoming
And then I saw you in the mirror
Off and running

But from start to finish...
