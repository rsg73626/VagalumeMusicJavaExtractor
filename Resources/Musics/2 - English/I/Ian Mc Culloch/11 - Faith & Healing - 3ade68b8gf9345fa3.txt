FAITH & HEALING

Everyone was running scared
Someone talked and someone heard
The twisted end to all the words
That I'd hung on to
One more time inside the dream
Where nothing has to be this real
And I don't ever have to feel
What I don't want to 
You once said I thought too much
But never thought enough to touch
Eyes so sad
Evergreen
The saddest eyes I've ever seen
Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith healing healing healing
Faith and healing...
Pick me up and hold me there
Leave me hanging in the air
'Til I promise I will care
The way I used to
Diamonds in the pool tonight
Reminds me of what nights were like
Before I fell into a life
That I got used to
The shining sea, the silver sky
A perfect world before my eyes
Don't be scared, don't you cry
If all the world goes passing by
Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith, faith and healing
Faith and healing...
You once said I thought too much
But never thought enough to touch
