VIBOR BLUE

Jigsaw man where have you gone?
Melted into morning
Don't believe in don't belong
Death-defying dawnings 

Vibor blue
The have-nots and the have-to's
The frozen chosen few
Destined to see it through
Born to vibor blue

Estoy candalabarar
Obligoing brightly
Voy e vamos a las stars
Twice nightly never lightly

Vibor blue
The have-nots and the have, too
The frozen chosen few
Are here to take us through
Gateway vibor blue

Limitless forsoothiay
Yo tengo muchos nada
Vaya con Dias all the way
Your madness made me sadder
Estoy candelabarar
Obligoing brightly
Voy e vamos a las stars
Twice nightly never lightly

Vibor blue
The have-nots and the have-to's
The frozen chosen few
Are here to take us, too
So is vibor blue
Destined to see it through
Born to vibor blue
