TOAD

Feeling strange and unsure
In the place where I'm standing
Feeling stained and impure
And I'm frightened of landing
Tie a flag on my head
Take a walk on a moonbeam
Just forget what she said
She doesn't know what she means

Five fingers and four divisions
That was all I ever counted
Love provided with all provisions
That was all I ever wanted

No escape from the truth
No return from the deep
Just a failure in faith
And a hunch in a heap
Stop the light coming in
Tell the day not to break
Let the night draw me in
And the walls not to shake

Call out the fire engines
Let's go down in a blaze of glory
Turn all the hosepipes on and
Bring in the hanging jury
Hang 'em high

We're cleaning the city now...
