HEAVEN'S GATE

All the holes in my head are the holes I made
Deep and deeper
Holding me holding me hold
Afraid
Weak and weaker will
You deliver me?
And turn me into someone
That I want to be? 

'Cos all I want to do
All I want to do
All I want to do is be a part of you

Take love as you find it
You lose your love breaking underneath the weight
Give love like you take it
You'll find your love hanging 'round Heaven's gate
Heaven's gate

I'm taking what's rightfully mine 
By birth
Not giving to you my skin and what's left of my mind
Less worth
Are going with me, too
Going with me, too
They're going with me, too
Going with me, too

Take love as you find it
You lose your love breaking underneath the waves
Give love as you take it
You'll find your love hanging 'round Heaven's gate

Hanging 'round Heaven's gate
Hanging 'round Heaven's gate

Is it true what I heard you say
There's nothing going right in your world today?
The glitter and the gold never come your way
Your starbound ride is still delayed

Coming out
Spinning round
Let you in and
Let you down

Take love as you find it
You lose your love breaking underneath the weight
Give love as you take it
You'll find your love hanging 'round Heaven's gate

Hanging 'round Heaven's gate
Hanging 'round Heaven's gate
