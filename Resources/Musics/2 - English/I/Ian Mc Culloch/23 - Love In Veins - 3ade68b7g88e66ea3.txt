LOVE IN VEINS

Really, really want you
Yeah I really, really need you
And I really, really got you under
My skin
In my skin, in my skin, in my skin

Early in the morning
And nearly every evening
I get those early, early warnings
Coming in, coming in, coming in

Chorus :
Can you feel it
Is it living
Can you touch it
Is it loving
Is it loving

Got you in my sun sun
Yeah got you in my rain
And I got you in my blood, blood
Love in veins, love in veins, love in veins

Chorus
