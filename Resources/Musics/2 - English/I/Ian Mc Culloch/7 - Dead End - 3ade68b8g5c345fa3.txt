DEAD END

Is it real or imitation
Life, the big and black dead end
All these hand-me-down emotions
Just a mask to help pretend
That I'm gonna leave this station
A happy man among sad men

Take your chance
It's now or never
And then it's passed
Forever

Are you planning to remain
On the outside looking in
'Cos everything be all in vain
And all the chances be so slim
Sad to see you all still waiting
For your boat to come back in

Take your chance
It's now or never
And then it's passed
Forever
Hold this time
And capture it
And make your final wish
