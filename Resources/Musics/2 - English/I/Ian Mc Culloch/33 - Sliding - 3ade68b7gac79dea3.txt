SLIDING

If you see me sliding
Say we're gonna slide together

If you see me hiding
Tell me I can hide forever

Come
With me now
As now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

When my clouds are crying
Say your gonna change my weather

If you hear me lying
Its never when we lie together

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

If you see me sliding
Pray that I wont slide forever

If you see me hiding
Say that we can hide together

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

your sun (x16)
