I KNOW YOU WELL

Is your mind made up or willing
To be changed or to stay true?
Are you primed to make the killing
Or too scared to follow through?
When all the blood is spilling
Will it be to real for you? 
I know you well
I know you well
I know you well
Yes I know you well
When everything is hollow
Holiness will call for you
And I will have to follow
And you will follow too
Will all those silver dollars
Be enough to see us through?
They know us well
They know us well
They know us well
Yes they know us well
Is your mind made up or willing
To be changed, stay true?
Are you primed to make the killing
Or too scared to follow through?
When all the blood is spilling
Will it pour right out of you?
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
Yes you know me well
You know me well
