MAGICAL WORLD

Raining down on me and it's no wonder why
I feel so low
'Cos it's down to you
You sucked away the faith I used to have in me
And it's fallen through
Yeah it's fallen through
You pump me full of holes
You pump me full of holes 

And all I want to know is
Is it really such a magical world?
Is it really such a magical world?
Magical world...

Swept out in the wind it's me as castaway
There's no ship to sail
Washed me up on shore
You pointed to my star and then it blew away
And you said to me
That's what stars are for
They fill you full of holes
Silver shining holes

And all I want to know is
Is it really such a magical world?
Is it really such a magical world?...
Magical world...
