HIGH WIRES

I'm still trippin' on high wires
My mind is frozen, but my soul's on fire.
I'm still wishing on the stars above
Just to give you what I'm dreaming of. 

To be found, to be found, to be found
Going down, going down, going down
To be found, to be found, to be found
It's some kinda love; it's working me over
It's some kinda love; it's working me out
It's some kinda love; it comes out of nowhere
It's some kinda love; you know what I'm talking about

Can't feel the way I should
Never ever thought I'd feel that good
No direction and no way in
Playing games I knew I'd never win
Going down, going down, going down
To be found, to be found, to be found
It's some kinda love; it's working me over
It's some kinda love; it's working me out
It's some kinda love; it comes out of nowhere
It's some kinda love; you know what I'm talking about
