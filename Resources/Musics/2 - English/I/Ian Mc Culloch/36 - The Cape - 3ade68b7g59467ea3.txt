THE CAPE

All confused and all-consuming
Scaled the heights of dizzy love
Didn't know how vertigo
Could leave me in the balance of
My heart and all the gods above
Stung and all strung up 

It's only navigation
So I'm moving overground
Past the cape of levitation
I'll keep hanging in when all the chips are down

Wooden houses, telegraph poles
Gave me reason and my shape
Casting shadows, marking pathways
Signposts showing our escape
Signposts showing our escape
The day, the time, the place

It's only navigation
So I'm moving overground
Past the cape of all temptation
I'll keep hanging in when all the chips are down

All aboard and all or nothing
All for one and one for all
The information must be hidden
Not not not for one and all
Not not not for one and all
One push and we will fall

It's only navigation 
So I'm moving overground
Past the cape of levitation
I'll keep hanging in
When all the chips are down
