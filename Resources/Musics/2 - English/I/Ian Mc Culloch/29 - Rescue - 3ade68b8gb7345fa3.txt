RESCUE

If I said I'd lost my way
Would you sympathize?
Could you sympathize?
I'm jumbled up
Maybe I'm losing my touch
I'm jumbled up
Maybe I'm losing my touch
But you know I didn't have it anyway

Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my
Rescue

Things are wrong
Things are going wrong
Can you tell that in a song?
I don't know what I want anymore
First I want a kiss and then I want it all

Won't you come on down to my
Won't you come on down to my
Rescue

Things are wrong
Things are going wrong
Can you tell that in a song?
Losing sense of those harder things

Is this the blues I'm singing?....
