HONEYDRIP

It's in my mind
In my body and soul
Stuck in the I can't understand
They're selling me views
Wave my flagpole
Don't need my eyes
Tie my hands

Drip honeydrip, drip your innocence
Drip, honey, drip through the night
Drip honeydrip, drip your inner sense
'Cos I'm feeling guilty tonight

Madness comes and then madness goes
Another warship in the night
Know your god, hope Heaven knows
Your wrong from his right

And drip honeydrip, drip your innocence
Drip over me through the night
Drip, honey, drip, drip your inner sense
'Cos I'm feeling guilty tonight

It's Guy Fawlkes night, pistols at dawn
Let's walk upon the misty moors
If luck runs out I'll go and buy some more
Chance for the chancers 
Fate for the poor

It's in my mind, in my body and soul
It's in my mind, body and soul...

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
No you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
You just might find
That it's in your mind
Body and soul
It's in my mind 
Body and soul...
Body and soul
