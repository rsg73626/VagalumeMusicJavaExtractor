IN MY HEAD

Round and round
(Deliver)
All the things in my head
(Me from good)
Round and round
(Deliver)
Did the things you said
(Me from good) 

On and on and on and on
(A to Z)
On and on and on...
(Good as dead)

In my head 
Things went 'round
In my head
I fell down

Come and gone
All the things we did
Nights so long
Those things well hid

On and on and on and on
On and on and on...

In my head 
Things went 'round
In my head
I fell down
Down...

In my in my in my head
In my in my in my head
