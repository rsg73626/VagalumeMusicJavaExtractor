STAKE YOUR CLAIM

Stake your claim and take your touch
Make this pain not hurt so much
Come and save me
Come and save me
Come and fix me up like new
Come and save me
Come and save me
Do those tricks you used to do 

I'll take my aim and place my bet
I know this game's not over yet
Know what I want now
Know what I want now
Know what I want now
Know what I want now

Come and save me
Come and save me
Come and fix me up like new
Come and save me
Come and save me
Do the tricks you used to do

Gotta be there when you get the call
Got to be the dust that falls from stars
Got to walk it like you know it all
Take the universe and make it our baby
And just maybe
And just maybe
You can fix me up like new
Come and save me
Come and save me
Do the tricks you used to do

Don't be late
Don't waste a beat
I'll lick your plate, it tastes so sweet
I will I will I will I will
