ANOTHER TRAIN

Too late, I know, the time to let it go
Don't wait, you know you've got to let it out, to let it show
And you know that something's coming
The writing's on the wall
The winds of change are starting to blow
I know 

Baby's on another train
She's gonna make this trip alone
Baby's on another train
She's going home, going home, going home

Can't take it slow
Cos yesterday's today's tomorrow
The stakes seem low
Until you have to pay for what you borrow
Cos you know that something's coming
The writing's on the wall
The wind of change is starting to blow
I know

Baby's on another train
She's gonna make this trip alone
Baby's on another train
She's going home, going home, going home

Too late, I know, it's time to let it go
Don't wait, you know you've got to let it out, to let it show
Cos you know that something's coming
The writing's on the wall
The wind of change is starting to blow
I know

Baby's on another train
She's gonna make this trip alone
Baby's on another train
She's going home, going home, going home
