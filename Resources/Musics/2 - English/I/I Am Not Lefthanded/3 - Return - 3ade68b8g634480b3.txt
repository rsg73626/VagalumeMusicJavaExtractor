RETURN

Oceans deep and two more sleeps from home
I pull my car to the right lane
The stars have dipped their lights and flown
What if I stayed? (I strayed, I stayed)

But there is no word
No glance returned
No soft concern or thought
That warms me like this place
No coat I've worn
One catch, I'm torn
This house that I'm built for
On my own I'm just water, wire and clay

Queues of people form their ranks to go
They're making thunder in the rain
My bags are weighted, stuffed and thrown
Sometimes I feel that way, this way

But there is no word
No glance returned
No soft concern or thought
That warms me like this place
No coat I've worn
One catch, I'm torn
This house that I'm built for
On my own I'm just water, wire and clay

I'm water, wire and clay

In the air there's a whisper of rain
But it's low in the sky and I'm safe
In the days when my memories run grey
I'll have dreams of return to sustain

But there is no word
No glance returned
No soft concern or thought
That warms me like this place
No coat I've worn
One catch, I'm torn
This house that I'm built for
On my own I'm just water, wire and clay

I'm water, wire and clay
