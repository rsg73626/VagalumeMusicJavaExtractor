BOATS (SWEPT AWAY)

Make a wish on whispered stars
For a road and faster car
And wait, see if it comes true
For a house on distant streets
Dream of nights in softer sheets
This beach, will wait

So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide
And at next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home

Let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side
I'm on your side
When weather's right
Come sailing home again
Walk the land and see the shore
Think of less and want for more
And wait, to keep the grey from blue

In a house on distant streets
Someone dreams a distant beach
And waits, they wait

So I know you're tired
So leave it to the tide
And at next light
When weather's right
Come sailing home

Let the dark subside
Just leave it to one side
I'm on your side
When weather's right
You'll see it swept away
You'll see it swept away
