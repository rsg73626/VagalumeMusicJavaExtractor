ALONE

It's not so bad alone
My fridge makes a noise that lets me know I'm home
The milk in my bones
Says this isn't the darkest night I've known

I know that this isn't the darkest night I've known

I'd walk some miles to sleep
But there's nowhere to run and no lights on my street
And my shoe with the stone
Says this isn't the darkest night I've known

I know that this isn't the darkest night I've known
I know that this isn't the darkest night I've known

And this is where I'll lie, this whole night
The fire and the sigh, threw no light
And this is where I'll hide
And this is where I'll hide

It's not so bad alone
The crack in my wall let's me know I've grown
'Cause stronger winds have blown
And this isn't the darkest night I've known

I know that this isn't the darkest night I've known
I know that this isn't the darkest night I've known

And this is where'll I'll lie, this whole night
The fire and the sigh, threw no light
And this is where I'll hide
And this is where I'll hide

In silence, I'm silent
Rewriting untitleds
Half-light it, burns brighter
In silence, I'll lie

And this is where I'll lie, this whole night
The fire and the sigh, threw no light
And this is where I'll hide
And this is where I'll hide
