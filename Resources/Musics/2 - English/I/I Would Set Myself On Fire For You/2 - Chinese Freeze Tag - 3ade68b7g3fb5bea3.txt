CHINESE FREEZE TAG

Colorfully black and white, rigid and whispered; blind to me are tears unfed and time means nothing to me. untoucable, unspeakably gone, yes i am empty. where history and memories meet i find confusion, glaze simple my dying light and all that's left is beauty.

traveling by a rule of thumb I'm coming to you at the speed of headlights. again i dream that canvas dream as autumn dances across the blacktop. enjoying fleeting moments as if they were forever pending as life chases us through a thousand tomorrows. but for now shine for your moment. it's still a moment to soon for us to shine together forever. worry not my dear, i'll be here watching you from only an arms length away.

tell me how to heal, help us tear the walls down. twisting and choking, we found the truth in love; lost in a field of promises we never meant to keep. broken, we had to reach the end to find a new beginning. we had to let go.

"just tell me that you'll try to/ call me to follow through. (i have missed my chance). i need to see someone else have to crawl to set me in motion again." 4am can hollar through the halls all it wants to. only the walls have ears and they went to sleep long before you arrived. (so tall they are: so cob-webby and sterile off-white).
