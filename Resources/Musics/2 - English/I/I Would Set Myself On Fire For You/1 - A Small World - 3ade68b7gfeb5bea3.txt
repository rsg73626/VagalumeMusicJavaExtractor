A SMALL WORLD

stephen: remember that you're in love. and the sun only rises when you stretch yourself forever west. when fingertips curl to parallel jawlines, remember you're in love. (you'll never find my fingerprint on the flame, dear darling god)

justin: i am not ashamed to have loved her for lesser things have caused the fall of greater men than me. but i have no more tears for her, so the sky cries for us tonight. i can't help but yearn for the love we once had and have now lost.

lindsey: love is a picture of glass, broken framed and held.

(stephen/justin/lindsey are members of the band and each paragraph is what they scream/sing individually)
