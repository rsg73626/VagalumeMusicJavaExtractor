ANIMOSITY

I'm sick of burning coffins just to prove
That I'm alive but I can still see
The dead every time I close my eyes
How many sick lonely nights carving
My name into the paint, until the voices
In the walls can convince me that I'm saint?
I'm counting down the days until I'm just another grave
Each year another nail as my body wilts away

Like a river that's shallow or a road that is deep
I've climbed to the top but the hills are so steep
Why feel so worthless when you've done what you can?
I know I deserve this. I will until the end
I'm not complaining cause I live for these
Sounds but it's hard to move forward
with your eyes to the ground

Sometimes I wonder how long it would be
Before someone came looking for me
I swear we're all dead, we've been dead for years
How many bodies can we turn before we notice the tears?
How many people can we hurt?

Like a river that's shallow or a road that is deep
I've climbed to the top but the hills are so steep
Why feel so worthless when you've done what you can?
I know I deserve this. I will until the end
I'm not complaining cause I live for these sounds
But it's hard to move forward with your eyes to the ground

I hope your actions leave you
in a world of solitude and loneliness
Because what you've left behind
is pure dysfunction and heart break
One day you'll feel it in your bones
You are worthless and soon my voice
will echo through your dreams
Is this an order? Or is this a plea?
How the fuck could you know what is wrong with me?
Sometimes I wonder how long it would be
before someone came looking for me
