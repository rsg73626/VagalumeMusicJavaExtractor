DREAD

We cover our sorrows with one gentle smile
How else could we live if not for denial?
I've seen this before, I've walked in those shoes
With a gun in my hand and nothing to lose

A few drinks down my throat, one thought on my mind
How simple it is to leave life behind

And as I sat at the edge of my bed
My left hand the gun, my right hand the lead
A boy walked through the walls in tears
Crying to me every one of his fears
Laying in bed in a room with no light
A mother and sister who fight every night
The thought of a father he hopes isn't there
Praying to someone who won't seem to care

This is my chance to leave it all behind
I'm at the end I'm running out of time
A few drinks down my throat one thought on my mind

We cover our sorrows with one gentle smile
How else could we live if not for denial?

So there I sat at the edge of my bed
My left hand the gun, my right hand the lead
The last thing he said before leaving me be
Is "I won't forgive you if you're the death of me. "

Am I sleeping? or am I dead?
Is my heart beating? is this the end?
