DISDAIN

I am the hand of madness
I am the end, I am the beginning
I am the hand of madness
So here I am, strapped to a body
and a mind I can't stand
I'm crying out, give me a hand
How do I brace myself solely on the man I am?

How can I be happy with myself?
Is there a point? Is there meaning?
Everyone's consumed with themselves
We've lost it all because you're fucked in the head
If life was black and white
with better times and far better people
We've lost it all, we've sent this place to hell

So here I stand, strapped to a body
and a mind I can't stand
I'm crying out, won't you please, give me a hand?
Give me a sign, I need an explanation
Give me some sanity to stand up to these fears
that I'm facing
If were stronger than I'd stand with some dignity
But it's harder when you're looking
in the face of your enemy

All I feel is hate, just get out of my mind
You say you feel the pain, it's just another lie
Take a second to sink to my level
I hold it in, but it's making me sick
I swear to God I'm releasing a devil
You let it out, and now you have to answer to it

So here I stand, strapped
to a body and a mind I can't stand
I'm crying out, won't you please, give me a hand?
Give me a sign, I need an explanation
Give me some sanity to stand up to these fears
that I'm facing
If were stronger than I'd stand with some dignity
But it's harder when you're looking
in the face of your enemy
All I feel is empty, so I'll make this place my home
What is there to care about? When nothing cares for me
