WARPAINT ON INVISIBLE CHILDREN

Far away from this factory town we won't be surrounded
I run into this with burning eyes
searching for that one thing that i know you hide
You know, these things... they hurt
Far away from this empty hole we will find just everything
I know you feel it beating inside
hiding that one thing that you know I will find
