ON/OFF

On and off
You can see the lights go on and off
And inside my apartment
You're like a stranger in the night
I know you don't care if the words comes out right
Cause I'm just someone just someone
Save everything that you were talking about
We're building storms inside
Save everything that you were talking about
Its time to kick it all out
On and off
You can hear the sounds go on and off and outside
This window I'm like a stranger in the night
And now we're building storms inside
Times like these makes you wonder
