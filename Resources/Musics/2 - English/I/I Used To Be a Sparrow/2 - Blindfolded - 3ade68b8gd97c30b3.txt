BLINDFOLDED

Maybe you don't know me
But I would jump blindfolded just to see
If the fall would crush me down
Or if the wind will take me somewhere now

This isn't what I long for. this isn't what I m looking for

I tried to bring it all down here
But its caught in between us now
I know I cannot run forever
Cause I will only run blindfolded

Those scratched out 45s
And all those drunken nights that I carry inside
I could disappear into a black hole
But I know they'll hunt me down
