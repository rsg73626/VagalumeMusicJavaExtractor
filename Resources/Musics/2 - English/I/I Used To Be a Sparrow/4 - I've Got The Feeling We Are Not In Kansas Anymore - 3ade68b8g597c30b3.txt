I'VE GOT THE FEELING WE ARE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE

Remember those rock and roll songs and endless nights
Remember the burning fire we held so tight
Those candles that we lit forever ago
The echoes of our steps as we move forward
Our racing hearts, they skip before the fight
We'll let september take the pain away as the story goes
