LAURA

Must have been something
That I kept inside
That wanted to get out of here
Cause now every word has got your name
Its all glowing inside glowing in here
We move like wolves on the run
Chased by the morning sun
I remember how we killed the night
By falling in love so easy
Everything was easy back then
But now my body aches
From falling in love so easy, too easy
Its 4 am and my head is still on
I wonder where you might be tonight
Cause this city will swallow me whole
