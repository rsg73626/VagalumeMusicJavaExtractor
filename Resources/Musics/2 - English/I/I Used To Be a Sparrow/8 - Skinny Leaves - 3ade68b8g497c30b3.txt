SKINNY LEAVES

While we count everything that we forgot
You and I, we shake like skinny leaves
I noticed something about you
That couldn't be seen
Before this box of mine opened up
Are we going to the place soon
That we used to dream about
Are we feeling everything we should?
It's not easy for anyone
While I watch everything around me disappear
You will shake this ground for me
I noticed something about you that couldn't be seen
Before this box of mine opened up
