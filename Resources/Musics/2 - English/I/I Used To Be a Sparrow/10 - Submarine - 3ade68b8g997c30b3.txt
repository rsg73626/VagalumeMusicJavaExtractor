SUBMARINE

I've been living in a submarine all along
but it's quite alright
I've been living in a bubble beneath the sea
but If felt just fine
until I looked up and stared at the sunset
Until I woke up, and wanted something more
We had it all, you and I
I've been living in a submarine all along
but it's quite alright
I've been living in a submarine all along
and the sonar scans these depths, but no land in sight
I've been drifting far away from the coast
cause up above it's all the same
