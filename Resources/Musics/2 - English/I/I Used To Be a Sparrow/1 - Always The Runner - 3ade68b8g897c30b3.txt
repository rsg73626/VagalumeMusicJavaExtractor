ALWAYS THE RUNNER

I've got this big hole in my head
And I filled it with things that don't belong there
I'm always the runner
Even if you create a home for me
And then I dive into something
That I really don't know anything about
Just give me a kick man
So I know what its all about
Cause I'm always the runner
I've got this strange feeling inside my chest
But I won't let anything get in
I'm always the runner
And spring is the one
Who saves me from darkness
