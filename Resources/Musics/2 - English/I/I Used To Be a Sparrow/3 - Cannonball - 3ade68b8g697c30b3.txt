CANNONBALL

It's always something stuck in between
I can't seem to get it right
Been chasing ghosts here before
Oh so many times before
Its like it had me already from the start
All caught up inside if these trees could talk
I would stay here forever
Don't follow me if you wanna stay safe
I'm just a cannonball
No need to climb higher
Cause the words will never reach out
Forever longing those golden beaches
Where you always forget the time
I know these fences can't keep me apart
Apart from what I really want
But inside they are building walls around me
Until then I just break ice
From the beginning to the end
