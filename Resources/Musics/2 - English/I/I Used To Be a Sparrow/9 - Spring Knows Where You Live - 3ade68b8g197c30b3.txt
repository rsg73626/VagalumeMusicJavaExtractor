SPRING KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE

Tell me everything tell me all at once
I'm getting bothered by the light of the sun
Tell me everything that I need to know
Cause then we sink into the ocean

This is not what we wanted, no
But this is what we turned it into
I'm running for better times., but my legs are to tired
I'm reaching for the sun
But my eyes won't open
Darling keep your hopes and dream for another day
We're just staring at the sunset tonight
Don't you ever feel you wanna get away?
Stuck on repeat like the crashing tide
