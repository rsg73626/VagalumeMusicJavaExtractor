THE LAST THING I NEED

CHORUS 
You're the first thing I want 
And the last thing I need 
You know if I was smart 
I would tuck in my heart 
And tell it to leave 
Don't you know I could fall 
I could fall so easily 
Everyday it goes on 
You're the first thing I want 
And the last thing I need 

What makes it so hard 
Is that it feels so good 
You're everything I dreamed of 
Feels just like it should 
There's just one thing more 
I got somebody else 
So I wake up each morning 
And I say to myself 

Chorus 

The thought of your kiss 
Is all that it takes 
I start imagining 
The love we shouldn't make 
Tried to forget you 
But I can't get enough 
No matter what I do 
When I wake up 

Chorus 

In a different space 
In a different time 
I could hold you in my arms 
And you'd be mine 

I wish there was a way 
(Spanish line) 
But I belong to someone else 
(Spanish line) 

Chorus 

You're the first thing 
You're the last thing 
You're the first thing 
Yes you are 
You're the last thing 
Don't you know I could fall 
I could fall so easily 
Everyday it goes on 
You're the first thing I want 

*Fade Out*
