They Say love will drive you crazy (crazy)
They say love aint black or white
They think they know it all, They got some crystal ball
This time i know they're right

They say keep your since of humor
No way that I can, u make me so mad
But your the best the best i ever had
So i guess its only natural, i should feel so irrational

Sometimes i hate you, But i love you too
Wanna run away, then run to you
Got to push me til i pull through

It makes me feel good, til i wanna scream
It's a nightmare in my sweetest dream
Makes me insane in the membraine
They say thats what love will do

They say (they say) love is complicated
They say thats what makes it work
Monday you make me cry
Tuesday you dry my eyes
Someday we'll laugh until it hurts
I get so upset 
but you know thats just how i get
So I'll give u both sides of my heart 
even though there miles apart

Sometimes i hate you, But i love you too
Wanna run away, then I run to you (wanna runaway)
Got to push me til i pull through (gotta push me tell I pull through)
They say thats what love will do (they say thats what love will do)
It makes me feel good, til i wanna scream (til I wanna scream yeah)
It's a nightmare in my sweetest dream
Makes me insane in the membrain (membrain)
