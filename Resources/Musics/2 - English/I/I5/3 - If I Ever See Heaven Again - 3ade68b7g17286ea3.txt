IF I EVER SEE HEAVEN AGAIN

You're leaving now 
I won't try 
Try to change your mind now baby 
I won't say 
The words designed to make you stay 
You've gotta live your life 
I won't stop you 
You've gotta do what's right for yourself 
I know 
No matter what you do 
I won't forget you 
I only know 

CHORUS 
If I, if I ever see heaven again 
It will be in your eyes, your eyes 
If I ever feel heaven again 
It will be in your arms, your arms 
It will be with you 

You walk away 
And I pray 
I pray our boats will cross again someday 
Deep in this heart of mine 
I still love you 
Deep in this soul of mine 
You'll be there 
I swear 
The sweetest time I knew 
Were times I had you 
I only know 

Chorus 

I'll wait for your heart baby 

You've gotta live your life 
I won't stop you 
I know 
No matter what you do 
I'll always love you 

Chorus x2 

It will be you and me 
It will be with 
It will be with you baby 
It will be with you
