SWEET N' SASSY

I am all-girl,
In this boy's world
But that's okay 'cause
I don't think of it
In those terms
I just give 'em mine
Don't even think 'em twice
When it comes to what I do
I make my moves right
And even though sometimes
I may seem kinda shy
Don't let this impulse
Let me feel like
I don't care why

I'm a sweet and sassy girl
I've got what it
Takes to change the world
Holding on to what I believe
I'm in control of my destiny

I just keep it real
I always know the deal
No matter what they say
It don't affect
The way I feel
I see nothing wrong
With having a little fun
When I want someone
Don't hesistate to
Turn him on
That's just the way I am
Most people don't understand
Secretly they wish they
Could be just like me

I'm a sweet and sassy girl
I've got what it takes
To change the world
Holding on to what I believe
I'm in control of my destiny

I'm a sweet and sassy girl
I've got what it takes
To change the world
Holding on to what I believe
I'm in control of my destiny

Sweet and sassy you see
No gravity or anybody
Will hold me back from
What I truly believe
There's no stopping me

I'm a sweet and sassy girl
I've got what it takes
To change the world
Holding on to what I believe
I'm in control of my destiny
(Repeat to fade)
