LADIDI LADIDA

I wanna see you come
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
Before I give you some
Oh oh oh oh

Here we go

Baby you can touch my
If I can get a taste of your
But you only seem
To care for money
And I don't wanna wait
A minute more
(Can't buy my love)

If you don't give it up
I swear I'm gonna stop it
Cuz I'm never gonna
Spend it on you

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some
Oh oh oh oh
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida

Baby you can drive my
Maybe I could ride your
If you're messing
You'll become my ex
We ain't never gonna have no
(Don't play around)

If you don't give it up
I swear I'm gonna stop it
Cuz I'm never gonna
Spend it on you

I wanna see you
Come into my life
Before I give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you
Come into my life
Before I give you some
Oh oh oh oh
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
I wanna see you come
I wanna see you come

I wanna see you
Come into my life
Before I
Give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you
Come into my life
Before I give you some
Oh oh oh oh
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida,
Ladidi ladida

I wanna see you come
