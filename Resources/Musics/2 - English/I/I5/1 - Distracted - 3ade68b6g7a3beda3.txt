DISTRACTED

All the time
It's always on my mind
All the time
It's always on my mind

The things that are runnin
Through this young girl’s head
When I get up in the morning
When I’m goin’ to bed
When I’m drivin’ in my car
When I’m talkin’ on my cell
Crammin' for a final
When I’m watchin TRL

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about
Hookin up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
You got me in a daze
I get distracted

When I’m standin in a
Line at the ATM
When I’m stirrin my sugar
In my café mocha blend
When the radio is playin’
A song like this
I float away suddenly
Dreamin of your kiss

I know it’s crazy
Livin’ in this fantasy
But I don’t know how to
Break this spell
You put on me
Tryin’ to stay focussed
On the things
I’m supposed to do
But before I know it
My attention’s back on you

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about
Hookin’ up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
You got me in a daze
I get distracted, yeah

Disconnected, yeah
Distracted, yeah
(Can’t help myself)
You got me in a daze

I know it’s crazy
Livin’ in this fantasy
But I don’t know how to
Break this spell
You put on me
Tryin’ to stay focussed
On the things
I’m supposed to do
But before I know it
My attention’s back on you

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about
Hookin’ up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
You got me in a daze
(Come on, baby)
I get distracted, yeah
Disconnected, yeah
(It’s what I do,
I think about you)
Distracted, yeah
(Can’t help myself)
Disconnected, yeah

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about
Hookin’ up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
(Preoccupied)
You got me in a daze
(In daze)
I get distracted, yeah
Disconnected, yeah
I get distracted
Disconnected, yeah
(It’s what I do,
I think about you)
I get distracted
