ATMOSPHERE

Hey, it isn't love you came here for
You know what I adore
But you're such a mystery
I'll take you to the stratosphere
A floating weightless feeling
We'll elevate this evening
So lets just get out of here

Chorus:
Take it up to outer space
And you won't ever come down
And I feel light years away
Cosmonaut take me up, take me higher
In the atmosphere

Eyes fixated, focus baby now I'm in a trance with you
The scene moves in slow motion anticipating what you'll do
The floor just disappears, we're in another place
You've got me hypnotized
I just want to feel your body touch my body now

Such a weightless feeling, just floating so high above the world
And the feeling's fleeting cus' in the morning we go home
So take it up to outerspace
