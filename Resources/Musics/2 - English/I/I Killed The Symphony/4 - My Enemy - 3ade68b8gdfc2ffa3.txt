MY ENEMY

I was living in a doll house
Where I used to feel so safe
Now I'm locked inside a prison
Where I just wanted you, I just wanted you

Confessions from the guilty
Commit my body to the flames
Innocence has been tainted
How is it pleasure can cause so much pain?

I just lost the best of me
Is there anything, anything?
You hurt me like you never could

You are my true addiction
Can't think straight in this condition
Human behaviors like this
Hard to trust my intuition
My Enemy

So you got just what you wanted
And we're both chemically insane
I'm missing my reflection
In the mirror now all that i can see's your face
In a true addiction, a compulsive dance with pain
There's no cruel intentions
But we both know we'll go back again and again

I just lost the best of me
Is there anything, anything?
Innocent and so naive
I lost everything, everything
You hurt me like you never could before
You hurt me like you never could

Chorus:
You are my true addiction
Can't think straight in this condition
Human behaviors like this
Hard to trust my intuition

And i don't know what's coming over me
I'm not the heroin I used to be
I'm fighting in a losing war
And sleeping right beside the enemy
My enemy

You are my true addiction
Is there anything, anything?
Human behaviors like this
Is there anything, anything?

And I don't know what's coming over me
I'm not the heroin I used to be
I'm fighting in a losing war
And sleeping right beside the enemy
My enemy
