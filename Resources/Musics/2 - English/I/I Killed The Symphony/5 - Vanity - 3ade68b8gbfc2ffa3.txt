VANITY

My eyes we're drawn in by a stranger
A pretty face within the crowd so you became my vice
I let you cut me like a razor
I let you pin me on the wall in ultraviolet light

Pre Chorus:
Focus, we shiver I'm freezing
You're like a deer in my headlight
You know I'm not afraid of anything

Chorus:
And when the music's over in the dead of the night
In a requiem dream where the symphony dies
It's vanity, it's tragedy

Verse 2:
A crimson letter on the mirror 
A clue to stop the vertigo and curb the appetite 
My fix of danger reappears
I'll keep you captive in my game until I'm satisfied

Pre Chorus:
Focus, we shiver I'm freezing
You're like a deer in my headlight
You know I'm not afraid of anything

Chorus:
And when the music's over in the dead of the night
In a requiem dream where the symphony dies
It's vanity, it's tragedy

Post Chorus:
And when it's gone, and this ghost leaves us haunted
The dawn washed away all the traces
Their gone, vanished out of existence
There's nothing to save us, nothing to save us now

Bridge:
Focus, we shiver I'm freezing
Your like a deer in my headlights
You know I'm not afraid of anything

Chorus:
And when the music's over in the dead of the night
In a requiem dream where the symphony dies
It's vanity, and it's you and me
A perfect tragedy

Post Chorus:
And when it's gone, and this ghost leaves us haunted
The dawn washed away all the traces
Their gone, vanished out of existence
There's nothing to save us, nothing to save us now
