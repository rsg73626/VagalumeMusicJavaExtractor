ALIVE

So many moments all spent carelessly
While you let them slip through your grasp
You know you sold yourself subconsciously
There's a question you forgot to ask

And you, your hanging by a thread
It's just a little time that we have left

Chorus
Are you feeling alive? Tell me are you
If you think it's a lie, tell me your truth
Are you pawns on the scene?
Where's your voice can you scream?
Are you onlookers just passers by?
Are you really alive?

So you tell yourself it's not happening
While your house of cards has just collapsed
All the nightmares we're not imagining
Are just faceless shadows of the past

And we are flies inside this web
It's just a little time that we have left

Are you feeling alive? Tell me are you
If you think it's a lie, tell me your truth
Are you pawns on the scene?
Where's your voice can you scream?

Are you onlookers just passers by?
Are you really alive?

Back to life again
We resuscitate

Are you really alive? Tell me are you
If you think it's a lie, tell me your truth

Chorus
Are you feeling alive? Tell me are you
If you think it's a lie, tell me your truth
Are you pawns on the scene?
Where's your voice can you scream?
Are you onlookers just passers by?
Now it's time to decide, are you really alive?
Cus' the hand of times counting down
Are you really alive?

Back to life again
We resuscitate
