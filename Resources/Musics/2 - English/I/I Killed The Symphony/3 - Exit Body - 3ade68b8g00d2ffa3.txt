EXIT BODY

Our sweet poetic life, I knew is now yesterday
I watch with darkened eyes, our resurrection has failed
Now I must pay the price, I've come unglued and derailed
I'll pretend denial, in denial

Chorus:
And I still scream in the night, 
Call your name as the resurrection fails
Left to bleed, nullified
Exit body, love dissolves away
Exit body, love dissolves away

Verse 2:
Drown, sinking in these lies
Were casualties of betrayal
Loss of love prescribes the hardest pills i could take
I'll dress in black for life, never lifting the veil
I'll confess that I'm in denial

Bridge:
(Dissolves away?)
(Exit body, love dissolves away)
