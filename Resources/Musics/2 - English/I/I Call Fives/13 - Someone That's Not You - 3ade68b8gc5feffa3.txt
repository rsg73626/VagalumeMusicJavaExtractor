SOMEONE THAT'S NOT YOU

I watched the light stream in through my window
Feel the sun beat down on my pillow
I haven't closed my eyes yet, still trying to forget
It's never easy to move on when it's taking you so long
Ii just thought that you should know

Time to get my conscience clean
Where I am not where I want to be
I know just where you hide
I hope you think about this every time
You've got to see that you're nothing to me
And all the games that you play are worthless
I just thought that you should know

We all make mistakes
And you were the worst one
Don't care what it takes
It's goodbye, so long
And I'll be looking for something
Yeah I'll be searching for someone
Someone that's not you

Lets take it back to a better time
A place stuck inside my mind
I just thought that you should know
It's always been so easy for me
To let go of the things that hold you back
You hold me back

Anyone but you
Anyone but you
Don't care what it takes
It's good bye, so long
And I'll be looking for something
Yeah I'll be searching for someone
Someone that's not you

Anyone but you
