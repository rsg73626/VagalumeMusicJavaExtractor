TRY HARD TO REMEMBER

I remember when you said
Growing up would come in time
But I'm still waiting here
You've been touching my life
You made so right
I say I swear
That someday I'll do something with my life
Someday I'll do something with my life

So try hard to remember
All the people you once called friends
And you'll find me
Waiting with a smile once a part of me
Will you miss me
When I swear that I'm gone

I remember when we said
We won't live for nothing
And I'll give anything
To be where I want to be cause
Second chances only come so often
And we're running out
We're running out of

So try hard to remember
All the people you once called friends
And you'll find me
Waiting with a smile once a part of me
Will you miss me
When I swear that I'm gone

I had the perfect life in front of me
And I threw it away
Cause I want to be everything
Other than what they'll expect
I hope that someday you'll forgive and forget
So try hard to remember
So try hard to remember

So try hard to remember
All the people you once called friends
And you'll find me
Waiting with a smile once a part of me
Will you miss me
When I swear that I'm gone
So long
