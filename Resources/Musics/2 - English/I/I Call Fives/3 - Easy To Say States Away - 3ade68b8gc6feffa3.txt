EASY TO SAY STATES AWAY

Just let it go
You're never gonna know
What's going on inside my head
Cause they're bound to work themselves down
Apparently I wasn't enough
To keep you caught up in the moment
Apparently I wasn't enough
No, I was never enough to keep you honest

Don't lose sleep living it up
Cause you were just always right
Just breathe slow taking it in
Cause I've been waiting for all my life
Don't fall so far from this road
Don't fall so, living it up
Cause you were just always right

As I run recklessly in place
Hoping just for the moment
This lie could replace
That smile on your face (Let's go!)
To say that this is in my head
(I won't put up, I gave you up instead)
I said this all before
But I'm giving it up
Cause you were just always right

Don't lose sleep living it up
Cause you were just always right
Just breathe slow taking it in
Cause I've been waiting for all my life
Don't fall so far from this road
Don't fall so, living it up
Cause you were just always right
Cause you were just always right

I've been waiting for a reason to trust you
But it's not so easy
Give me just a reason to trust you
And it's not so easy
It's not so easy

Apparently I wasn't enough
No, I was never enough
Cause you were just always right

Don't lose sleep living it up
Cause you were just always right
Just breathe slow taking it in
Cause I've been waiting for all my life
Don't fall so far from this road
Don't fall so, living it up
Cause you were just always right
