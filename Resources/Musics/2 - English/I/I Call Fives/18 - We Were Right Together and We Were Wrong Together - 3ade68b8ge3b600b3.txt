WE WERE RIGHT TOGETHER AND WE WERE WRONG TOGETHER

We've watched you sink, and its 
A little more than sad that you've lost all trust
Was it really all that bad?
Now your eyes are pinned shut and your tongue has been stuck
Its hard to see this end
Today I lost a friend

Long story short we can see right through you
You don't know what you've gotten yourself into now

Its hard to make amends when you turn your back on your friends
Its hard to make amends when you turn your back on them
Its hard to make amends when you turn your back on your friends
Its hard to make amends when you turn your back on them

Long story short we can see right through you
You don't know what you've gotten yourself into

So lets hear the excuse I won't believe
Tell me what I'm too blind to see
Well this is more important than the people we're supposed to be
