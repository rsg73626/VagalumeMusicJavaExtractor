OBVIOUS

Certainly obvious and you don't care
With all the things you say you know I'm there
I'm so falling behind again
I'm convinced that this is the end for me

Can't get this bad taste out of my mouth
I'm lost in something and I've gotta get out
I should have seen this coming
Still stuck and left with nothing

I'd have to climb into a casket to get as slow as you just went
I'm sick of giving into something (Is this the best that I can get?)
When it all comes down to the facts 
you can't admit when you're wrong
When it all comes down to the facts 
you can't admit when you're wrong

I'm fading in and out
There's some words that won't come out
So whats left to say?
When you're not listening, not listening anyway

I'd have to climb into a casket to get as slow as you just went
I'm sick of giving into something (Is this the best that I can get?)
When it all comes down to the facts 
you can't admit when you're wrong
When it all comes down to the facts 
you can't admit when you're wrong

I've given up on everything and started letting go 
of all the reasons I've held on for too long

I'd have to climb into a casket to get as slow as you just went
I'm sick of giving into something (Is this the best that I can get?)
When it all comes down to the facts
 you can't admit when you're wrong
When it all comes down to the facts 
you can't admit when you're wrong
