ENEMY

Show em' one thing used to be
I've become friends with the enemy
Not sure what happened here but everything seems insincere
I'm digging my own grave
I'm into deep for you to save
So go, just walk away
Save your shit for another day

Sometimes you just can't wait
I'm more than happy to not fit in (with your friends)
I hope you don't make it home
Someday that you'll face it
Cause the world doesn't spin for you

There's not one thing that used be
You can't keep your eyes on the enemy
