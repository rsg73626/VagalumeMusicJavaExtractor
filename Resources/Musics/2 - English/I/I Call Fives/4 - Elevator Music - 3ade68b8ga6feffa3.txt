ELEVATOR MUSIC

I hope this song is the elevator music
On your way to hell
And here's to all the stories that you told so well
And knowing every one was a lie
Now I think I'm ready to try

You've got the rest of your life
To figure out that everything was gonna be fine
Don't try to tell me you were right
When all I know is everything you said was a lie
And I can't breathe
Cause I don't feel the same
As I did when I first heard your name
And I've got no reason left to stay
And I'm sorry

I hope this song is the elevator music
On your way to hell
And here's to all the stories that you told so well
And knowing every one was a lie
Now I think I'm ready to try this out

And I still don't have a clue
Cause I don't know what I thought when I heard you
The worst words that ever left your lips
Was the first time you meant it

I hope this song is the elevator music
On your way to hell
And here's to all the stories that you told so well
And knowing every one was a lie
Now I think I'm ready to try this out

And on the ride I hope you hate this

I hope this song is the elevator music
On your way to hell
And here's to all the stories that you told so well
And knowing every one was a lie

Are you ready to try this out
It's complicated cause the words you say
Don't have a clue
And now I'm overestimating my whole life
And now I think I'm ready to try

I hope this song is the elevator music
On your way to hell
And here's to all the stories that you told so well
And knowing every one was a lie
Now I think I'm ready to try
