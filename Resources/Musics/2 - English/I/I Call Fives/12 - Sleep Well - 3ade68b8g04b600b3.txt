SLEEP WELL

I drove by your house last night only to remind myself what never was,
What could have been, but you left me for dead and I'll tell you something.
I hate the way you make it seem like I never meant anything.

Sleep well tonight
Sleep well tonight
Cause when your lies catch up to you
You know there's nothing I can do but pull the knife in my back and give it back to you

You're a mess and you're alone this time
The world is moving and you're whats left behind
And every word I ever wrote in every song
I let them go with you that buried deep and gone

So take a breath and hold it deed cause you never meant anything.

Sleep well tonight
Sleep well tonight
Cause when your lies catch up to you
You know there's nothing I can do but pull the knife in my back and give it back to you

And while your eyes are closed I'll tell everyone so you're exposed
The bright light creeping through the crack in the dark
You can't stop whats next in store

Sleep well tonight
Sleep well tonight
Cause when your lies catch up to you
You know there's nothing I can do but pull the knife in my back and give it back to you
