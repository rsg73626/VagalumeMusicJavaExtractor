LATE NIGHTS

If I don't hear from you by two Am
I can assume that you found something better to do
It's easy to see what's happening
You're so lost at twenty-three
You can't argue with the truth when no one really knows you

Not moving forward
Looks like I'm just missing you again
You have to find what you left behind
If you ever want to see me again
I never want to see you again
I never want to see you again
I never want to see you again
I never want to see you again

I can't depend on you to leave me anything but all alone and empty
I'm sorry you're not sorry
And if you think I'm going to let this slide
You've got another thing coming
Aren't you tired of running?

Not moving forward
Looks like I'm just missing you again
You have to find what you left behind
If you ever want to see me again
I never want to see you again
(I want to see you around)
I never want to see you again
(I want to see you around)
I never want to see you again
(I want to see you around)
I never want to see you again
(I'll forget what you did)

You know I've been waiting for you
You know I've been waiting for you
You know it all went wrong
I tried to save it all for the sing along
I've gone through hell and back with time to spare
I'd do it all again just to leave you there

Not moving forward
Looks like I'm just missing you again
You have to find what you left behind
If you ever want to see me again
Not moving forward
Looks like I'm just missing you again
You have to find what you left behind
If you ever want to see me again
