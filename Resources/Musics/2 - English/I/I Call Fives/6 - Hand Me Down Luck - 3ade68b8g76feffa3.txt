HAND ME DOWN LUCK

Keep asking questions and you might get some answers
I assure you it's not easy
This was just a disaster
But that's just what you'll get
When you put your faith in me
I'm sure you all would agree
That almost everything I've ever said
Was just to bring the conversation in a better direction
That's all I've got
And I've been hanging by a thread

I don't want to remember
I don't want to remember
Every chance I get, I fail
I don't want to remember

So here's the thing
I wouldn't wish my luck on anybody else
And I've been trying to change for three years
But every time I attempt, things go to hell
Now in the past three years
I've made some mistakes that I regret today
Now it's time to change
Cause everything I want is only a step away

I don't want to remember
I don't want to remember
Every chance I get, I fail
I don't want to remember

Two, three, four
I don't want to remember
I don't want to remember
Every chance I get, I fail
I don't want to remember
