THE FALL GUY

We were kids so long ago
But as time caught up to us we refused to let go
You make it so obvious
Why are you so obvious?

And I think that the hardest part
You lack the heart that it takes so you just keep taking from me
It didn't have to be that way
It doesn't have to be this way

This time you did it again
You'll blame it on everyone else
Directions
And speak loud and clear
You fucked it all up again and no ones there

So hide your face cause you just wished I'm him
And after all the time and said you're an embarrassment
Its sad to say that I ever put the time in you
You just lack the ability to come through

You make me miserable
Sometimes its more than I can take
I hope you're comfortable
Just watching as you throw your life away

This time you did it again
You'll blame it on everyone else
Directions
And speak loud and clear
You fucked it all up again and no ones there

I'm not sorry for a word I said
I'm not sorry for a word I said
I'm not sorry for a word I said
I'm not sorry

This time you did it again
You'll blame it on everyone else
Directions
And speak loud and clear
You fucked it all up again and no ones there
