WRONG THINGS

I won't lose out anymore
I won't live that way
Seems sad to see that this was wasted on nothing at all

I've been putting too much emphasis on the wrong things
Yeah, the wrong things
So what if it doesn't work out
I'll keep faith that that's not what this is about
It's good to realize it's who you're with, not what you've done

I won't lose out anymore
I won't live that way
Seems sad to see that this was wasted on nothing at all

Our chances never gone
Keep moving on and on
I'm chasing my dreams
I'm saddling for nothing
On and on and it's the same old songs that hope for nothing
You won't have to wait for me
Don't wait for, don't wait for me
I'll end this hopeless mentality

I won't lose out anymore
I won't live that way
Seems sad to see that this was wasted on nothing at all

This time, let's start it all over
This time, I know I'll do better
But now, I think I learned enough to shut my mouth and let go
Somehow, if it doesn't work out
I'll keep faith that that's not what this is about

I won't lose out anymore
I won't live that way
Seems sad to see that this was wasted on nothing at all
