ALL YOU'VE GOT LEFT

Its too late to wake away from this now
You're too late and I'll start telling you how
You never had it
You never had it anyway

Not looking back now
I can't afford the gas it took to get me here
Life's too short for pointless beer
I'm giving everything I've got so take these words 
with more than open ears
I've given six whole years to this
And I'm tired of this shit

Don't forget
Don't put your guard down yet
Its a game we play, so tired of losing everyday

Haven't we gone over this before?
We tried a million times so whats once more?

Its too late to walk away from this now
I'm over this and our played out tracks
Its just all the same
Can't wait till this ends

Another day feeling like this
Another day feeling like life's all the same
And I'm not sure if I can take
When every chance I take just comes right back to me

And I'll say for once how I really feel
I wanted you to know that I can see through you

Haven't we gone over this before?
We tried a million times so whats once more?
And I'll you now, no more bringing me down
Not today
Not today

No more chances (that's what you've got left)
No more chances (that's what you've got left)

I don't think I've got the time
I'm done wasting my mind
I'm done wasting my time
I'm done

No more chances (that's what you've got left)
No more chances (that's what you've got left)
No more chances
