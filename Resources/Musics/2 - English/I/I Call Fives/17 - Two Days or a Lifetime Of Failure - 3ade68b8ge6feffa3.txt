TWO DAYS OR A LIFETIME OF FAILURE

Well I hope I'm making my way with each note
I'll pull together the pieces I wrote
There isn't a doubt I'm on my way down
We get up, we get out, and we go
We're making our way to the coast
Together we found out
That all we lost was a little hope
But for now we're fine
Because we're following our own road

Yeah, if we ever hit the ground
We'll get right back up
Just like we're doing now
And in the city of strangers
We'll be waking up the neighbors
And it's too early to go home

With all this pressure building up
We never learned our lesson
Now we're stuck
With only two days left and our eyes are sore
In a hotel room in Baltimore
We're making our way to the coast
Together we found out
That all we lost was a little hope
But for now we're fine
Because we're following our own road

Yeah, if we ever hit the ground
We'll get right back up
Just like we're doing now
And in the city of strangers
We'll be waking up the neighbors
And it's too early to go home

Let me tell you
We've all been there before

Yeah, if we ever hit the ground
We'll get right back up
Just like we're doing now
And in the city of strangers
We'll be waking up the neighbors
And it's too early to go home
