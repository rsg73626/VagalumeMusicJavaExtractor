STUCK IN '03

I was listening to Take This To Your Grave,
So Long Astoria and Nothing Gold Can Stay
You said I'm filling my head with nonsense and 
I'm throwing my life away
Its nice to know you're here
I'm glad that you still care
How the hell do fix a problem that you were the cause off
The songs we sang, the words we wrote
And all the personal pain for them coming out my throat

I'm used to being bloody, broken down and beaten
I can show you all the scars that you've been leaving
Its plain to see there's nothing left between you and me
Useless memories
You're so wrong

Remember the time you told me good things 
come to those who wait?
You were wrong
And I'm still trying to let you know how much this sucks, 
it makes me sick

So finally I'm starting to see how little you think of me and it hurts
Couldn't care less but it couldn't be worse

I'm used to being bloody, broken down and beaten
I can show you all the scars that you've been leaving
Its plain to see there's nothing left between you and me
Useless memories
You're so wrong

You know you're so wrong
You know you're so wrong
You know you're so wrong
It makes me sick
You know you're so wrong
You know you're so wrong
You know you're so wrong
It makes me sick

So finally I'm starting to see how little you think of me and it hurts
Couldn't care less but it couldn't be worse

I'm used to being bloody, broken down and beaten
I can show you all the scars that you've been leaving
Its plain to see there's nothing left between you and me
Useless memories
You're so wrong
