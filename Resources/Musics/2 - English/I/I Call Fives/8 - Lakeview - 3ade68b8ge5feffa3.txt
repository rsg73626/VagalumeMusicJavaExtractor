You like to think
You like to think that nothing's changing
But you're alone in this and there's a reason
It's hard to admit when you know that you're wrong
When every line and every lie is piling on
Now I ask of you, just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Now I ask of you, don't be sorry now
Don't be sorry now
Don't be sorry now

I'd rather be homesick than warm in my bed
Far away from the world and the things that you said
I won't stand by your side and beg for affection
I shouldn't have to scream just to get your attention
And I'll save revenge for another day
I'll save revenge for another day

I'm losing sleep again
And I'm constantly reminded of the times that we tried to be friends
You never cared
So where were you when no one else was there?
(Where were you when no one else was there?)

I'd rather be homesick than warm in my bed
Far away from the world and the things that you said
I won't stand by your side and beg for affection
I shouldn't have to scream just to get your attention
And I'll save revenge for another day
I'll save revenge for another day

I'd rather be homesick than warm in my bed
Far away from the world and the things that you said
I won't stand by your side and beg for affection
I shouldn't have to scream just to get your attention
I'd rather be homesick than warm in my bed
Far away from the world and the things that you said
I won't stand by your side and beg for affection
I shouldn't have to scream just to get your attention
And I'll save revenge for another day
I'll save revenge for another day
