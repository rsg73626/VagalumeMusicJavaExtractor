REGRETS AND SETBACKS

I'm still taking steps back
And I feel it all the time
Just another setback
Another useless day behind
I've been dwelling on my weakness, and it's been getting to me
How long can this go on?
Come to terms with the fact that you can't go back
There's always something to hold you down 
if you won't get off the ground

When you don't know which way to go
When you feel like you've lost all hope
Don't give up
Don't give anything those thoughts in your mind
Get over saying sorry for overthinking all the time

The last chance is now
We're running out of time
Don't ask me how, but if life is slipping by
All those nights and all those drives
Watching as all their dreams just died
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like for me

When you don't know which way to go
When you feel like you've lost all hope
Don't give up
Don't give anything those thoughts in your mind
Get over saying sorry for overthinking all the time

Someday, you'll see how easy it is to forget
The ones not worth remembering in the first place
Someday, you'll see how easy it is to forget
The ones not worth remembering in the first place

When you don't know which way to go
When you feel like you've lost all hope
Don't give up
Don't give anything those thoughts in your mind
Get over saying sorry for overthinking all the time
