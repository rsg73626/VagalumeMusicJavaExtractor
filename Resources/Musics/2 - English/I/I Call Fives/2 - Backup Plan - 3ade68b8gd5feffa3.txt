BACKUP PLAN

So let me tell you a story of how it all began
You're fake, fucked, and boring
The same as all your friends
The same as all your friends
And while you stand there looking to heaven
I'm moving on again cause I've had it

Don't make a sound
(Don't make a sound)
Cause you were another one that just kept me around
And I don't think that I can stand
Knowing I was a backup plan
And I told you once before
I don't want to feel that way anymore
So I'll let you go
And give it everything I've got to never come back home

You had it all
And it's hard to watch you throw this all away
I can't believe how much you changed
You became everything I hated
I think you're fully overrated
Proving once again how much you can get underneath my skin

Don't make a sound
(Don't make a sound)
Cause you were another one that just kept me around
And I don't think that I can stand
Knowing I was a backup plan
And I told you once before
I don't want to feel that way anymore
So I'll let you go
And give it everything I've got to never come back home

Don't make a sound
You kept me around
Don't make a sound
You kept me around
You kept me around

Don't make a sound
(Don't make a sound)
Cause you were another one that just kept me around
And I don't think that I can stand
Knowing I was a backup plan
And I told you once before
I don't want to feel that way anymore
So I'll let you go
And give it everything I've got to never come back home
Never come back home
