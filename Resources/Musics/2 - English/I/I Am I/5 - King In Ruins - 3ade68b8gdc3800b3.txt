KING IN RUINS

Close together,
Miles apart inside..
Differences, we cannot seem to hide..
Fear and anger,
Overcome your pride..
Messed up way of life,
You need to get by...

You know forever?
It's such a long, long time..
To live your heart must beat,
To stay alive..!
Why the heartache?
Why the mindless crimes?
Stand outside the box,
And open your eyes...

Still the blood runs through my veins,
There's a place that I belong..
Roots in foreign soil,
Still my heart beats on..
Reach inside your soul,
Fight the anger you control..!
It's time, oh, it's time..!
Leave the world behind..

Not a place that we ain't been..
Conquered all the world,
What a scene..
The past will haunt us,
The future won't be kind..!
Don't say what you will,
Don't say that we cannot survive..!

Still the blood runs through my veins,
There's a place that I belong..
Roots in foreign soil,
Still my heart beats on..
Reach inside your soul,
Fight the anger you control..!
It's time, oh, it's time..!
To leave it all...

What's the price?
When will you realize?
You're a King In Ruins!
Why can't you see,
that there is not one thing left, for me..?

Still the blood runs through my veins,
There's a place that I belong..!
Roots in foreign soil,
Still my heart beats on..
Reach inside your soul,
Fight the anger you control..!
It's time, oh, it's time..!
Leave the world behind..
