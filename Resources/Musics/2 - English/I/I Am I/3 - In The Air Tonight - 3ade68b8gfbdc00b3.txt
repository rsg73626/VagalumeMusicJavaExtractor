IN THE AIR TONIGHT

I smell a mutiny, I feel it in the air
Still a million miles away
And don't fit anywhere
Just a piece of destiny,
Our futures to be told!
We raise our arms in unity,
Our fortunes to behold!

There's no sanctity, no place for me
No ordinary man,
It's no mystery, you know I can!

There's a chill in the air tonight!
Nothing can ever be alright
Close my eyes, I see the signs
They've been there for all my life!
There's a chill in the air tonight!
Gone are those walls you hide behind
Say your prayers and make it right!

I was caught between right and wrong!
With no where to belong
Choked up on the words I thought,
My mind keeps growin strong!
Raise your head among the livin dead,
The endless mind control!
Still trapped inside this universe,
No comfort for my soul!

There's no sanctuary, no place for me
No shelter from this storm
Lost our unity, we see the world reborn!

There's a chill in the air tonight!
Nothing can ever be alright
Close my eyes, I see the signs
They've been there for all my life!
There's a chill in the air tonight!
Gone are those walls you hide behind
Say your prayers and make it right!

There's a chill in the air tonight!
Nothing can ever be alright
Close my eyes, I see the signs
They've been there for all my life!
There's a chill in the air tonight!
Gone are those walls you hide behind
Say your prayers and make it right!

There's a chill in the air!
