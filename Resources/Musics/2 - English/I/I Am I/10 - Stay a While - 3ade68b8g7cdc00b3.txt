STAY A WHILE

Stranger in this town,
Always on the lookout, on the run
You almost couldn't care,
Yet loneliness is there

Drowing on the seas of madness,
Broken heart to weigh you down,
You desperately try, 
But you cannot deny!
Say goodbye, it will bury you under!

Stay!
Stay a while as you cross your heart
And you hope to die
Stay!
Stay and watch it all fade away

Moment of truth,
There's a moment to behold!
Creation come undone,
As you watch the past unfold

Now here and forever
Don't let in your way
It's one and the same,
They preach their gospel in vain!
No time to waste!
Time waits for no one!

Stay!
Stay a while as you cross your heart
And you hope to die
Stay!
Stay and watch it all fade away

Stay!
Stay a while as you cross your heart
And you hope to die
Stay!
Stay and watch it all fade away

Ooh, just stay!
Stay a while as you cross your heart
And you hope to die
Stay!
Stay and watch it all...
Fade away, yeah, ooohh...
Fade away, yeah, ooohh...
Fade away!
