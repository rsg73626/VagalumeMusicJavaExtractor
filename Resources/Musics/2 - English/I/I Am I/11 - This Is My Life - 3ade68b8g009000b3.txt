THIS IS MY LIFE

Here I stand, I'm ready for another day.
When everything you know may never be the same.
Now's the time, to say what's really on my mind!
Reality is lurking through these eyes of mine!

Now! Through this world and through the skies,
And the truth's so hard to find!
Spend your life walking the line,
While you crucify mankind!

This is my life!
(There's no fear in my soul!)
This is my life!
(Only I have control)

All this time, you were there, right by my side
To help me up and give me hope to be alive,
Days gone by, but still you resurrect my pride!
Simply could not fight my away against this time

Now, that they've paid for all their crimes,
They have nothing left to hide,
No redemption will you find,
Just a broken man inside!

This is my life!
(There's no fear in my soul!)
This is my life!
(Only I have control!)
This is my life!
(Taking back what they stole!)
This is my life!
My life, wooooooah!

*Solo*

This is my life!
(There's no fear in my soul!)
This is my life!
(Only I have control)
This is my life!
(taking back what they stole!)
This is my life!
