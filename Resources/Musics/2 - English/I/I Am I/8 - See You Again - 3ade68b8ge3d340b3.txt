SEE YOU AGAIN

Say never in a thousand years, do we shed the tears
Do we know the price of war
Forever and a single day
Would it end this way, I never ask you for more

Didn't have the words to say, like a child at play
You are the one I adore
Spread your wings into the sky, as you say good bye
You make me come back for more

I see you again, I see you again
Gone are these days together
A season in vain, a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever

Tears won't get you sympathy, only you and me
I can feel it more and more
Nothing to replace our shame, but a burning flame
It melts you to the core

Never will you feel my pain?
Will it be the same?
One day I'll be back for more
Standing in the pouring rain
Only me to blame
Let my ship sail from the shore

I see you again, I see you again
Gone are these days together
A season in vain, a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever
I see you again, I see you again
Gone are these days together
A season in vain, a lifetime the same

Don't let it pass you by, I wanna see you try (see you try)
There's no escaping this, I'll hold my head up high

Never will you feel my pain
Will it be the same
One day I'll be back for more
Crying in the pouring rain
Only me to blame
Let my ship sail from the shore

I see you again, I see you again
Gone are these days together
A season in vain a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever

I see you again, I see you again
Gone are these days together
A season in vain a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever

I see you again, I see you again
Gone are these days together
A season in vain a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever

I see you again, I see you again
