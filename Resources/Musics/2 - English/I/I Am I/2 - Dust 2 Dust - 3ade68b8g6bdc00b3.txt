DUST 2 DUST

Now it's the best you've ever had
Oohh..
How times have changed!
Here is something to remember me
You live, you don't even care!

All this time, I can still recall
Here and now, as you watch angels fall

Hit the lights, don't wait forever!
Destiny is all but a friend to me
Lonely nights, won't last forever!
Once again hit the lights!

I can recall the memories
They all...
Slowly fade away!
You get consumed by all the things
I am still living day by day!

Once again, from the dust I came
Twice remain, from the dust all the same

Hit the lights, don't wait forever!
Destiny is all but a friend to me
Lonely nights, won't last forever!
Once again hit the lights!

Hit the lights, don't wait forever!
Destiny is all but a friend to me
Lonely nights, won't last forever!
Once again hit the lights!
