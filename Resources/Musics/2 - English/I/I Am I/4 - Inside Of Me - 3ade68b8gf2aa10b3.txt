INSIDE OF ME

Talk to me, say what you will
You are the voice that keep me still
You're inside of me
You're inside of me

So many times
So many times it's hard to lie
I'm alone with you
You're alone with me

Places and faces they all come and go
Only one constant you stay with me

We both came together as one
I'm in charge of the run
Sometimes regret things still
Life that's where our journey's begun
When they ask I'm the one
God of my own creation

You are the one my loaded gun
Break every rule under the sun
You're the best of me
You're the rest of me

And every time
And every time I can't deny
You belong to me
I belong to you

You are my conscience, my guilt, my remerse
Some day I'll leave, will you follow me

We both came together as one
I'm in charge of the run
Sometimes regret things still
Life that's where our journey's begun
When they ask I'm the one
God of my own creation

We both came together as one
I'm in charge of the run
Sometimes regret things still
Life that's where our journey's begun
When they ask I'm the one
God of my own creation

I know that you're inside of me!
I know that you're inside of me!
I know that you're inside of me!
I know that you're inside of me!
I know that you're inside of me!
