KISS OF JUDAS

There are places in our world
There are things that we don't know,
No one can tell us

Common sense your only friend
And my right to question all those answers 
I can't find

Just a ripple in the pond
A way of telling you what we want to see
Telling you what we want to see

More and more each day
Most of your suspicions start to
Fade away, again and again

There was no beginning 
And there will be no end
Together you stand
Together you will fall in your promised land
Again and again
May the sun always shine
On your dreams, on the days of your life
It's not what you spend
But what you do with the knowledge you can't comprehend
Again and again

Nothing tastes as good as rain
You are the one, devour all our wisdom

We've come a long, long way
You are consumed by all the things you hide in vain

Still it ripples through the pond
And still there's nothing there to remind you
Nothing there to remind you

The kiss of Judas again...

More and more each day
Slowly all of your ambitions
Fade away, again and again

There was no beginning 
And there will be no end
Together you stand
Together you will fall in your promised land
Again and again
May the sun always shine
On your dreams, on the days of your life
It's not what you spend
But what you do with the knowledge you can't comprehend
Again and again

Again and again
Again and again!!

The kiss of Judas again...

More and more each day
Slowly all of your ambitions
Fade away, again and again

There was no beginning 
And there will be no end
Together you stand
Together you will fall in your promised land
Again and again
May the sun always shine
On your dreams, on the days of your life
It's not what you spend
But what you do with the knowledge you can't comprehend
Again and again
Again and again
