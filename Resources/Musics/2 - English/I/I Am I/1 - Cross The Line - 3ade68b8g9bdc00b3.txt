CROSS THE LINE

No communication
You don't know the steps you take,
It's a violation
Every sing move you make
It's a strange sensation
You can feel it, in the air

You tell me that I crossed the line!
The thought that never crossed my mind,
You tell me that I crossed the line!
You leave it all behind

Cover my eyes, tell all your lies!
Make me believe, there's a light tonight
It will be alright

No association
I don't know the steps you take,
It's no consolation
Every single rule you break
It's a strange sensation
I can feel it, in the air

You tell me that I crossed the line!
The thought that never crossed my mind,
You tell me that I crossed the line!
You leave it all behind

Cover my eyes, tell all your lies!
Make me believe, there's a light tonight
It will be alright

Cover my eyes, tell all your lies!
Make me believe, there's a light tonight
It will be alright
Cover my eyes, tell all your lies!
Make me believe, there's a light tonight
It will be alright
