PAVE THE WAY

Another casualty, another of your crimes
A fake reality intentions in disguise
A cross we have to hear a curse upon these times
One more victory a heartbeat lost in time

You never, you never
Hear your childrens cries
Forever and ever
Feed upon these lies

Run Away
We know you can't save the day
The youth of tomorrow
Don't let em slip away

Run Away
You know you can pave the way
You're dead in the water
As is has been before 
What was will haunt you once more

Another memory, another day's begun
A freak discovery a nation on the run
To gather all you can befalls the prudent man
You bury history it's written in the same

You never, you never
Hear your childrens cries
Forever and ever
Feedupon these lies

Run Away
We know you can't save the day
The youth of tomorrow
Don't let em slip away

Run Away
You know you can pave the way
You're dead in the water
As is has been before 
What was will haunt you once more
