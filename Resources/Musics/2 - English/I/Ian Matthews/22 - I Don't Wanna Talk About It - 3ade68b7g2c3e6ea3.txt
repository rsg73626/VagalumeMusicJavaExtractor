I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT

I can tell by your eyes you've probably been crying forever and the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you they're a mirror i don't wanna talk about how you broke my heart if i stay here just a little bit longer if i stay here won't you listen to my heart my heart if i stand all alone can the shadows hide the colors of my deep blue tears black the nights we're apart and the stars don't mean nothing to you they're a mirror
I don't wanna talk about
How you broke my heart if i stay here just a little bit longer if i stay here won't you listen to my heart my heart
