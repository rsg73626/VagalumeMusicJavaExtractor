COVER GIRL

I'malive 
I was only dreaming 
you arrived when 
I was hardly breathing 
Come inside 
I'm alive cover girl 

In awhile 
you will know the meaning 
you and I will 
Recognize this feeling 
Come inside 
Stay awhile cover girl 

We are in big trouble 
You'd never know 
It's silent it's subtle 
Just let it go 

Let it go 
Let it run forever 
Cover girl you'd 
Better warn your mother, 
your sisters, your children 
Come inside 
Let it go cover girl 

Bye and bye 
It will seem too easy 
Once you know it 
you will know completely 
Come inside 
Bye and bye 
I'malive 
Let it go cover girl
