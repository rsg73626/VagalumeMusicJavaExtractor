ROOTED TO THE SPOT

I was staring backwards as you were 
Tearing loose a scream 
I can't fix this coffee 
It won't make no steam 
I can't believe what I just walked into 
Now I'm rooted to the spot just 
watchin' you 

You say I should count my blessings 
'Stead of giving you advice 
You are my cohabitator 
Not my sacrifice 
My mind's so clear I don't know what to do 
I'm rooted to the spot just 
Watchin' you 

I was dancin' dancin' indiscreet 
I could not groove 
I could not find the beat 
You shook me up and set me on my feet 
Stopped this fumblin' fool 
From dancin' indiscreet 

I was cryin' mercy 
Livin' off the gold we mined 
Fifteen teams of horses could not 
Make me tow the line 
You keep askin' what I'm gonna do 
I'm rooted to the spot just 
Watchin' you 

I was leaning back 
While you were choking down a scream 
You said, I cannot work miracles 
Despite how it may seem 
I can't believe what I just stepped into 
I'm just rooted to the spot 
Watchin' you
