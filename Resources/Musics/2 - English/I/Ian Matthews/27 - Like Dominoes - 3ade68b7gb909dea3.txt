LIKE DOMINOES

I was riding in an old black Rover 
You were sleeping at the bus stop 
Didn't see a thing until the night exploded 
Just like a picture just like a photograph 
Mama warned you this could happen 
Never in her wildest dreams did she leave you 
cal!ing 

I was sitting on the back porch freezing 
You were jawing with the night watch 
Didn't know a thing until we lost that feeling 
Just like a picture just like a snapshot 
She never let you have a losing season 
Never in her darkest hour did she leave you 
cal!ing 

And when it blows we're gonna fall 
Like dominoes you won't believe it's happening 
And when it goes they're gonna call 
You domino just like I pictured 
Just like I pictured it 

I was dead to the radio blaring 
You were playing at the bypass 
Didn't know a thing until the room was clearing 
Just like a picture just like a photograph 
She never kept any secrets from you 
Never in a mil!ion years did she leave you calling 

Close as a heartbeat cold as a star 
High as the heavens you are
