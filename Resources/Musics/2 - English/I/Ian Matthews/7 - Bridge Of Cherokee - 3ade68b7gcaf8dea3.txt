BRIDGE OF CHEROKEE

You fall, she cries so softly 
Oh wait for me 
I know she cannot hold you 
From the bridge of Cherokee 

In the dark a dream will crumble 
Even disappear 
I wave, but you don't know me 
All you find is darkness here 

In the night the bird is wailing 
What a lonely sound 
Soaring soaring 
Floating down 

In the dark y ou will go under 
What a rendezvous 
I wait, there is no lifeline 
Only me and only you
