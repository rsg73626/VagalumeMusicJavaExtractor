BEAT I WALK, THE

Power lines buzzing, ten to the dozen 
Can't get it right at all 
CIock says two-thirty, I think itâ€™s early 
Who says that time won't crawl 
You and your brother, close to each other 
Your world is still so small 
I'm undecided which horse I'm riding 
This is the beat I walk 
Living in stages, this soft parade is 
Starting to wear me down 
You are a beauty, I mean that truly 
I am like Cathy's Clown 
So unbelieving, I'm bobbing and weaving 
I need to leave my mark 
I'm undecided which horse I'm riding 
This is the beat I walk 
Coyotes are fussing, storm must be passing 
I never heard it start 
This book I'm reading says once more with feeling 
Love with your head and heart 
You and your pages of building in stages 
Me and my crazy talk 
I'm undecided which horse I'm riding 
This is the beat I walk 
God, it's so quiet, I don't feel tired yet, 
Life is a pantomime 
When I was twenty, the turn of the century 
Rarely would cross my mind 
Lips touching ankles 
Fingers in tangles 
We are a world apart 
Still undecided which horse I'm riding 
This is the beat I walk 
I'm undecided which horse I'm riding 
This is the beat I walk 
This is the beat I walk
