LIVING IN REVERSE

I saw a man shoot an eagle down 
Hit him once, maybe twice 
Thought it was an omen for things to come 
Cut him up with his knife 

He took those little bits of innocence 
Mailed them off to his friends 
Hung them in their hallways and living rooms 
And thought their luck woufd not end 

There's arrows and there's aeroplanes 
There's men and there's mice 
There's rabbit's foot and eagle's claw 
There's living and there's life 

Now everybody's superstitious 
It's a blessing and a curse 
Believing everything is black or white 
It's living in reverse 

Watched a man shoot an eagle down 
Saw it fall from the skies 
It took a little light from inside of me 
It put a shine in his eyes
