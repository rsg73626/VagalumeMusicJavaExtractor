COMPASS AND CHART

Oh there once was a sailor marooned on dry land 
A voyageless captain a crewless command 
With the wind in his hair he's a sight to behold 
But an oceanless sailor will not be consoled 

He once was a young man and not unlike me 
With the chart and the compass for his guarantee 
With a hand on the wheel and a full magazine 
If you'd known young Riley you'd know what l mean 

Oh he would not hold fast there was no compromise 
It was full speed ahead take them all by surprise 
The greatest ot sailors changed course and heaved to 
For Benjamin Riley, his ship, and his crew 

Oh oh anchors away 
Live for the giving day after day 
Oh oh laugh and be sad 
Just believe in yourself and trust in your God 

Now most men I know you would not see for dust 
As their passion tor treasure turned into a lus 
t And Ben the adventurer was still unprepared 
When purely by chance he discovered it there 

Oh it danced and it sparkled, it beckoned, it cried 
Please keep me and take me along for the ride 
For you know I can make you a young millionaire 
Come now, Captain Riley, you don 't have a prayer 

Oh for all of your shining I don't give a damn 
And you will not distract me from what I've begun 
For the stars are my sisters the sea is my heart 
And I will not be drawn from this compass and chart 

Oh oh anchors away 
Live for the giving day after day 
Oh oh laugh and be sad 
Just believe in yourselt and trust in your God 

So they hoisted the anchor and folded the chain 
As he pointed her eastward and back home again 
It was seventeen days it was sixteen long nights 
Before he encountered the strangest of sights 

They came down to meet him and took him by force 
And they questioned his morals for leaving that purse 
Saying we made you a captain a company man 
But now seaman Riley y ou don't suit our plans 

Oh oh anchors away 
Live for the giving day after day 
Oh oh laugh and be sad 
Just believe in yourself and trust in your God 

Oh they've taken his vessel and paid off the crew 
And they've taken his charts and his compasses too 
But Benjamin Riley he still has the heart 
And the will and the spirit he's had from the start 

Oh there once was a sailor marooned on dry land 
A voyageless captain 
A missionless man
