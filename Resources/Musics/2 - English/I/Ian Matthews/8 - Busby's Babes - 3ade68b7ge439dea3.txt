BUSBY'S BABES

I'll see you again my red devil friends 
I'll hear you around my door 
Touching my life like so many memories before 

I was a child and so easily led 
You were the leaders of men 
Now I doubt in my life if this ever happens again 

Oh how I cried when my mama said 
Busby's babes son, they're dead 

Oh how I remember that miserable day 
When something was taken from me 
Out on a snow covered runway in West 
Germany
