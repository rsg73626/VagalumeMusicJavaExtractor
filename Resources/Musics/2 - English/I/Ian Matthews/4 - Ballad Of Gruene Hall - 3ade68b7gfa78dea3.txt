BALLAD OF GRUENE HALL

Said she felt like a spare wheel 
On that Fourth of July 
She just needed to talk to somebody 
And he caught her eye 

She was in from San Angelo 
On her very first try 
She thought he looked pretty cute out there 
For a local guy 

He was fresh out of high school 
Never been with no girl 
He thought she didn't belong 
In that caked-up dance hall world 

She said, I don't know what possessed me 
It got me up on my feet 
I had a vision of the two of us out 
there, she said 
Rosa and Pete 

It was a July night when the blues came down 
A July night in that one-horse town 
A July night when the blues came down 
In Gruene Hall 

They’d been out in El Paso 
On a third honeymoon 
Why is it always the quiet ones 
That leave so soon 

She said, I won't forget my confusion 
Turned to smile, he was gone 
He'd been hummin' some gospel tune 
About some glad morning 

They said he fell in slow motion 
I just heard him hit the floor 
Idon't recall ever seein' them boys 
Around here before ! 

Refrão

She said, It's my dance of remembrance 
It' s my dance of regret 
It's my dance of forgiveness 
I ain't about to forget 

Don't wanna talk about Texas ; 
Don't wanna talk about trust 
Don't wanna talk about family, Can't even think about blood 
Don't wanna talk about salvation 
True love or defeat 
Just wanna think about him and me, she said 
Rosa and Pete 

Refrão
