THE RAINS OF '62

Grew up with a borrowed name 
A little heart of porcelain 
Here a hustle, there a shove 
A kid to take advantage of 
I guess it was a big surprise 
When I appeared before your very eyes 

Brothers yea, I had a few 
I know they thought the world of you 
In your eyes they could do no wrong 
Me, that was a different song 
My life was a compromise 
As I grew up before your very eyes 

I know your life was misery 
So deep and wide 
My life's a memory, ten stories high 

When I left for London in the rains of '62 
When I left home it didn't mean that much to you, 
Now I look back on all the changes 
I went through, growing up in the rains of '62 

I still remember coming home 
Running to the telephone 
In time to hear somebody say 
You'd better get here right away 
Your dad he left us in the night 
He's disappeared before our very eyes
