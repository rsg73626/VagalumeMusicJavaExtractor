GIRL WITH THE CLOUDS IN HER EYES

On a road late at night 
your heart is a mirror 
You reach back in time 
But you hardly can see her 
There's a dress on the back seat 
And a far away smile 
See how she flies 
She's the girl with the clouds in her 
Eyes 

There's a box by your bed 
Where you bury good intentions 
Hidden in your memory 
It vanishes in seconds 
And you wake up with a feeling 
That she was by your side 
See how she flies 
She's the girl with the clouds in 
her eyes 

She's there for a second 
And then gone like a vision in the night 
There's a trace of her here 
In the light of dawn where I wait 
Out of time, out of focus 
For the clouds to disappear 

There's a lake on a map 
That you always must visit 
In a boat made of crystal 
You're the only one in it 
There's a storm all around you 
And only one way to survive 
See how she flies 
She's the girl with the clouds in 
her eyes 

Like a snake in the grass 
They offer you temptation 
You reach out for help 
But you're bitten with frustration 
They tell you to look for her 
The one with love on her side 
See how she flies 
She's the girl with the clouds in 
Her eyes
