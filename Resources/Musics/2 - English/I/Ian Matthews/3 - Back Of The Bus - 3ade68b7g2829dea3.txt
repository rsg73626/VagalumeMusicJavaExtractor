BACK OF THE BUS

Well you talk about disease 
Like it's part of the plan 
Another God sent plague on the 
common man 
You talk about love 
The way you think about lust 
Like it's something obscene 
You don't wanna discuss 
Like it doesn't exist in your 
Neck ofthe woods 
You think it's over-rated 
And misunderstood 
You'd rather ship 'em like cattle 
To the Hindu kush 
I'm gonna write it all down 
In the back of the bus 

Oh oh I feel the heat 
Oh oh I feel the rush 
Oh oh I feel the heat 
I'm gonna move on down 
To the back of the bus 
I'm gonna make my stand 
In the back of the bus 
I'm going to write it all out 
In the back of this bus 

They got forty-six thousand 
Less today 
In the name of freedom 
In the U.S.A. 
We gotta stick it to them 
Before they get to us 
They got enough heat stashed 
To blow us all to dust 

You got control greed confirmity 
Just three little words 
That don't apply to me 
In a couple of summers 
When you all adjust 
You'll be riding with your buddies 
In the back ofthe bus 

Refrão 

Man, look at that monkey over there 
I bet you think you're tough 
Well, I ain't scared 
You got a face like that damn 
Sun Yung Moon 
I saw you praying to the East this 
afternoon 
Well you've taken our women 
And you got our jobs 
With your Chinese writing 
And your foreign gods 
I don't want you sitting down here 
next to us 
Why don't you take that 
Seat in the back of the bus 

Refrão 

Well, tv's flashing the subliminal lie 
They're gonna bend you shape you 
And crucify you 
If you know your wines 
Then it's understood 
You don't need a good reference 
You can join the club 
But before you even know it 
There's a couple of kids 
It's a fine line you're walking now 
But God forbid 
You wanna talk to him 
You gotta give to us 
Man I think I'm gonna throw up 
In the back of the bus 

Well this ain't no time to celebrate 
We got too much sorrow 
And too much hate 
We got too much them 
And not enough us 
Man there's too much heat 
In the back of this bus
