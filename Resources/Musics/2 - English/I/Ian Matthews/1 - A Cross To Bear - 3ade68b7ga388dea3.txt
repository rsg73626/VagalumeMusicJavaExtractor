A CROSS TO BEAR

I died one night when the sky was a blanket of stars 
And you sounded as clear to me then as I'd heard you in years 
As I lowered my eyes understanding the news that I'd heard 
You just turned away taking your smile and those crippling words 

Then you blew from my life like the southern wind stealing a flame 
'Til all I had left were the tears at the drop of your name 
And I know I'm just blinding myself into thinking you care 
Maybe one day I'll rush in and discover you there 

Love is an anchor 
Love is a knife 
Love is the healer in my liife 

And I know that it seems like sometimes I howl at the moon 
But it's something that happens when loneliness steps in the room 
Though I know I'm just fooling myself in this sorry affair 
One night I'll awake from a dream and uncover you there 

Chorus 

Though I know I'm just hurting myse1f  it's a cross I can bear 
Cause I died one night when the sky was a ribbon of stars and you 
were there
