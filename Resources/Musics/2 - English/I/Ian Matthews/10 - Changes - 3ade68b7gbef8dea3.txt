CHANGES

She says howdy do, I says what's your number 
She says you know that, I says I can't remember 
She says I know you, you're just tryin to twist it 
I says there it is, I don't know how I missed it 
She says you're so indiscreet 
Why don't you look before you leap 
I say more tnan that I think we need some changes 

She says take me home, I says you can walk it 
She says don't be cruel, I says look who's talkin' 
She says honey please tell me what you're thinkin 
I says pour me three of what she's been drinkin 
She says you are so bizarre 
Better count your lucky stars 
I says more than that, I think we need some changes 

Changes falling thick and fast 
Changes never built to last 
Change has got his slippery grasp on you 

She says look here, I says baby stop it 
She says what's that thing stickin' out your pocket 
She says let's get tight, i says we just tried to 
But I got something here that's gonna pacify you 
She says better safe than sorry 
Now you're in my territory 
I says more than that, I think we need some changes 

Changes come and changes go 
Changes humming sweet and low 
Change has got his spiney claws on you 

She says bye bye love, I says baby whoa now 
She says down the road, I says where'd she go now 
She says see you then, I says you got to wonder 
She says wonder what, I says I can't remeber 
She says you're so adolescent 
I guess there's no time like the present 
I says honey let me help you make some changes 

Changes twist and changes spin 
Changes fake and genuine 
Change has got his nasty sting in you 

Changes falling thick and fast 
Changes never built to last 
Change has got his slippery grasp on you 

Changes come and changes go 
Changes humming sweet and low 
Change has got his spiney claws in you
