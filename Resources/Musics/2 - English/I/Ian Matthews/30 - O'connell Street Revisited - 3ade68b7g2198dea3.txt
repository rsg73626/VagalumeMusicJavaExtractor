O'CONNELL STREET REVISITED

Will you meet me in the city tonight 
Oh now you've got me hoping 
Say you'll meet me in the city tonight 
We'll have some fun, go dancing on O'Connel! Street 

Will you meet me in the city tonight 
Oh look you've got me hoping 
Say you'll meet me in the city tonight 
We'll have some fun, go dancing on O'Connel! Street 

O'Connell Street 
You've left your mark 
O'Connell Street 
Give back my heart 

Will you meet me in the city tonight 
Oh now you've got me hoping 
Say you'll meet me in the city tonight 
We'll have some fun 
Go dancing on O'Connell Street
