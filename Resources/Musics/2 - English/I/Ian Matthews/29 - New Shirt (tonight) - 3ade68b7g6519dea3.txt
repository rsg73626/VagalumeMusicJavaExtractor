NEW SHIRT (TONIGHT)

What is the point in keeping on so deathly quiet 
You know nobody lives here 
What's in your pocket come on let me see 
I'll buy it. There's nobody at home tonight 

Tell me the one about the laughing politician 
That's a funny story 
I don't know where you get so many lies 
About me. I should have left you at home tonight 

I traded your heart for another one 
I thought I' d told you before 
I bought a new shirt so I'd be recognized 
Now I don't wear it no more 
I told you a lie, said I needed you 
I never needed you less tonight 

Right in the middle of my favourite piece 
You started, man I need a new number 
I don't care who's invited 
I don't want your party 
Why don't you leave me alone tonight
