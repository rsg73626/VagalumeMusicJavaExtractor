ROLL AWAY THE STONE

She stepped out of the back door 
In her old brown travelling shoes 
She had a dream last night 
And it's left her so confused 

She woke up with an angel 
Sitting on her front porch swing 
Said theangel to Mary 
Are you ready to go travelling 
Said Mary to the angel 
Just tell me whence you come 
Tell me what is your purpose 
And how do you know my name. 

She said I'm a desperation angel 
Although some might say heaven sent 
I've got some money in my pocket 
And a letter from your president 

We've got to roll away the stone 
Roll away the stone 
Forgive them for they know not what they do 

She sat down on the front porch 
She was puzzled to a fine degree 
She said I know he's in trouble 
But what can he need of me 

Said the angel to Mary 
He calls you his Tennessee belle 
He says they know all abou tyou 
And that night in that Memphis hotel 

And there are those among us 
Who are evil to the bone 
He's no angel, Mary 

And Ive got to carry you home 
We've got to roll away the stone 

Roll away the stone 
Forgive them for they know not what they do 
So throw your coat on Mary 
We've got to leave while it's dark outside 
You don't need no protection 
Cause I'm gonna be your guide 

So she stepped out of the back door 
In her old brown walking shoes 
She had a dream last night 
And it's left her so confused
