GET IT BACK

Ooh you glide like a cat, You're a diplomat 
You've got nothing to prove you've been 
Living like a little girl. 
Ooh you're so discreet. You've got dancer's feet 
You've got lines in your face 
You've been living in your little world. 
Ooh you singe my soul, you got such control 
You're just reeling them in 
'Til you got 'em in your littte world 

You're electric I'm affected 
I refuse to be rejected 
I'm a learner- wait your turn 
You'll get it back 

You're the Chinese line, You're a Red Cross sign 
You're afraid of dying and you're mine mine mine 
You're the St.Paul's step you're a sure fire bet 
It's not over yet, it's not over yet 
Ooh you glide like a cat, you're a diplornat 
You've got nothing to prove 
Living like a little girl
