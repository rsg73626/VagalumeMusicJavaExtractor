DAVEY'S STUNG

Davey's stung, he's got that bug again 
Davey's stung, he's fallen in lust again 
Davey's stung and hurting 
Davey says he needs a woman in his life 
Someone to make him feel whole 
He says I can't imagine what it's even like 
He's out of control 

Davey says this ain't the way it's supposed to be 
Without a leg to stand on 
And what's a man to do with all that 
misery after she's gone 

Refrão

Davey says he had the real thing years ago 
Full of peaks and valleys 
She pushed him places he was not prepared to go 
Opened  his eyes 

Now wait a minute, Davey 
It's me you're preachin' to 
Not some pretty face 
For you to come on to 

Davey says his world 
Is such a phony place 
It runs on who you are and who you know 
What's it worth if she can't 
Say it to your face 
The girl has to go 

Refrão
