CAVE IN

Better call the neighbors 
telephone the kids 
I think there's been a cave in 
'cause of what I said 

Home is where the pain is 
ain't that what they say 
I've gone and caused a cave in 
and you were in the way 

Cave in 
Cave in 
Keep away 

Look inside it's raining 
It's coming down in sheets 
It always takes a cave in 
to get me on my feet 

I've thought about escaping 
Just going round the bend 
If there's gonna be a cave in 
I've gotta leave again 

Cave in 
Cave in 
Keep away 

This talking leaves me crazy 
I know it drives you up the wall 
There's been another cave in 
and I can't talk at all 

Cave in 
Cave in 
Keep away 

Cave in 
Cave in 
Keep away 

Cave in 
Cave in 
Cave in
