DRIVE

Drive, I must drive 
I'm a singer with a guitar 
And I'm learning to survive 
Drive, I must drive 
And I hope these four wheels 
Get me there tonight 

Car sickness is a state of mind 
Some doctors would imply 
I carry this affliction like a sore 
If I was in a higher earning bracket 
I would fly 
Confusing my condition all the more 

Oh I cannot for the life of me 
Remember where I've been 
I sure remember how much I've been paid 
When gasoline's a dollar thirty 
And you stay in a motel six 
Reality just rears back 
And kicks you once a day 

Drive, I must drive 
I'm a singer with a guitar 
And I'm learning to survive 
Drive, I must drive 
And I hope these four wheels 
Get me there tonight
