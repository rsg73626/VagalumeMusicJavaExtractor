THE BREATH OF LIFE

Sometimes I go to pieces 
Clear out of my mind 
Sometimes I got no reasons to give 
For doing what I'm doing 
But only sometimes 

Sometimes words cut the deepest 
Still your love's all I can find 
Sometimes I feel no right at all 
Belonging or believing 
But only sometimes 

Sometimes I go crazy on you 
And I whine just like a child 
Sometime my imagination runs wild 

Sometimes I'm under water 
Out of sight and out of mind 
Sometimes I feel the breath of life 
upon me 
Surrounding me, caressing me, yes 
anf holding me 
But only sometimes
