JUMPING OFF THE ROOF

When Sam and Jean were growing up they didn't give a hoot 
They had a game they loved to play called jumping off the roof 
One Sam had learned from his old man, a Vietnam marine 
And when he knew it absolute, he taught the rules to Jean 

Now Jean she was an only child a few doors down the street 
And when the two were introduced Sam didn't miss a beat 
When Jean displayed her interest, well he wasn't fireproof 
So he showed her all there was to know 
'Bout jumping off the roof 

Jump said Sam 
Oh, I don't know said Jean 
Come on jump Sam said 
This may be your only chance to be my beauty queen 

Now jumping off the roof it was a game made up of parts 
The first step comprised of taking hold of Jeanie's heart 
Second stage was easy once y ou had that perfect fool 
And Sammy knew the torture weIl, cause he'd made up the rules 

Next came the important part, he had to make her cry 
And he set free the meanest, cruelest stunts he could untie 
And when he felt for certain Jean was just about to sink 
Then he unleashed that velvet tongue and snatched her from the brink 

Refr√£o

In time they found that jumping was a blessing and a curse 
Love without a blindfold can be suicide or worse 
Sam became an expert in the art of lies and truth 
And Jeanie loved to play that game called jumping off the roof 

Jump said Sam 
WeIl alright said Jean 
I'll jump, she said 
Because this could be my only chance to be your beauty queen
