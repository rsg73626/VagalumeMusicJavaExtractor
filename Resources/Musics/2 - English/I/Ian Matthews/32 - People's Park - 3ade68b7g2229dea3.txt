PEOPLE'S PARK

Mary's crying, drowning in her tears 
She stuck a piece of cotton in the little one's ears 
Woody left town six days ago 
He ain't a-coming home for all he knows 
Mary's crying, trying to stat calm 
Kneeling in the red dirt, screaming up a storm 
And Woody don't care, sleeping in the fields 
Says he gotta stay put till the conflict heals 

And Woody's song splits the dark 
To peel  away the years 
Mary's gone to people's park 
To reel in Woody's fears 

Mary's crying, it's on uphill climb 
She's tearing at her roots for the thirteenth time 
Woody's got a handle on what's going wrong 
He's gonna light a fire with a union song 

Still Mary' crying, pining for her man 
Says she's gonna write him every chance she can 
But Woody don't care, he's taking his time 
Just praying for the boys on the government lines 

And Woody's song splits the dark 
To peel away the years 
Mary's gone to people's park 
To reel in Woody's fears 

Mary's crying, poking at her fear 
It'll all seem distant this time next year 
Woody's in deep, it's a pretty big deal 
Carving out a groove for the kids next meal 
Thought she heard his song on the radio 
It was something 'bout a fight 
'bout a migrant war 

And Woody's song splits the dark 
To peel away the years 
Mary's gone to people's park 
To reel in Woody's  fears
