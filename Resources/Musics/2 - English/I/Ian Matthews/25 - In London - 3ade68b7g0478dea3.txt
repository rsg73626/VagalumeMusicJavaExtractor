IN LONDON

London that I used to know 
The one from 30 years ago 
Declares it's lifeless status quo, and 
so it goes 

In London they got subway trains 
The House of Lords and acid rains 
The Albert Hall, it still remains 
In London where I spent my prime 
Youth was king that summertime 
I thought I'd pulled the perfect crime 
Being there, sleeping by your side 

In Lodon we were scatterlings 
When consciousness meant everything 
Now we choke on bigger things 
And who said grow them wings and fly 

In London where the city jeers 
At architecture's golden years 
Where no man steps or interferes 
In London 

In London we had high ideals 
A sense of style and Cuban heels 
You don't forget how good that feels 
In London town the money screams 
At long forgotten kings and queens 
From strike intensive union teams 
And who sais grown men never cry 

In London where she hung her head 
I only work here, Sir, she said 
I didn't weave this tangled thread 
In London where you feast your eyes 
As dreams are born and passions fly 
But, brother, are you satisfied 
And who said dreams they drift like snow 

In London where commandments drool 
Like wisdom from the mouths of fools 
They didn't learn that stuff in school 
In London 

Oh, London that I've grown to hate 
I've seen your class evaporate 
Signed Disillusioned, Sad, Expatriate
