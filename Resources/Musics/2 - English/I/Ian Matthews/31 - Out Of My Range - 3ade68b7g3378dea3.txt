OUT OF MY RANGE

There you go what a sorry sight 
You've been around the back laughing at 
The ground all night 
You're gonna waste yourself on a thing like that 
She's an independent you know where that's at 
You'd say 
Let her run they're all the same 
Let her fade away don't try to play that game 
Where's the fire will y ou concentrate 
It's a littler version of everything you hate 
I think I'm losing you 

You're out of my range again 
You're making it plain 
You're out of my range again 

J know you cry it's the damndest thing 
You've exercised your option now reel me in 
I see you found the door weIl here's the key 
Are there any more out there like me 
I think they're fooling you 

Show it don't be a hero 
Go ahead show it nobody's near you 
Why don't  you take it 
Why don't you take it
