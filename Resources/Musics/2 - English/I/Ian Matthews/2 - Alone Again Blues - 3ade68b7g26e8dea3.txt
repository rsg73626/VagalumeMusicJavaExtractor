ALONE AGAIN BLUES

She slipped out of the door in her traveling shoes 
Got a man on her mind, not a minute to lose 
She's so well intentioned, but hardly a clue 
And she just can't shake these alone again blues 
Just the night before last she awoke with a start 
After falling asleep by the fire in the dark 
She felt something was wrong 
Something strange and bizarre 
And she needed to stop it from tearing apart 

When they met it was brief, he was cool and so loose 
She  walkingon air in some other girl's shoes 
In a moment of weakness, he'd tried and she knew 
There'd be nothing to show but alone again blues 

And she sings, 
"Red sky evening, now he's leaving 
Grey sky morning, now he's gone" 

WeIl she let him walk out without even a fight 
By convincing herself they were too much alike 
When he cursed her and left her, it seemed only right 
They'd just bitten off more than they'd planned in one night 

WeIl she broke down and cried, but it wasn't no good 
For the thought of him leaving just darkened her mood 
Till the rage she was feeling polluted her blood 
And she could not believe how he'd misunderstood 

She raved and she ranted, it wasn't her fault 
And she could not abide a man not worth his salt 
It was something much deeper than pride could undo 
It was poetic justice, alone again blues 

And she sings, 
"Red sky evening, now he's leaving 
Grey sky morning, now he's gone" 

So she drove through the city all over the place 
She was feeling rejected, feeling disgraced 
She finally gave up, parked outside of his place 
With this mask of bewilderment covering her face 

She's the kind of a girl he won't ever forget 
A little mistake that he couldn't correct 
It's "finders are keepers," it's "merci beaucoup" 
When you just can't shake those alone again blues 

And she sings, 
"Red sky evening, now he's leaving 
Grey sky morning, now he's gone"
