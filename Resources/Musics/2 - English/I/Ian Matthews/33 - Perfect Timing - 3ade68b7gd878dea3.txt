PERFECT TIMING

Oh girl are you really leaving now 
Not on my account don't blame me 
Oh girl are you gonna stand or fall 
'Cause after all it won't hurt me 
Oh girl you don't hear a thing I say 
communicate 

There's no such thing as perfect timing 
Nothing's wrong but nothing's rhyming 
There's no such thing as perfect timing 
Nothing's deeper than what I'm in right now 

Oh girl are you heading underground 
Are you upside down, weIl not by me 
Oh girl give me just a tiny clue, I'd kill for you 
Just talk with me 
Oh girl you don't hear a word I say 
communicate 

So you felt the power and the glory 
You divided our whole world in two 
Is there anything left you remember 
I'll remember you 

Oh girl how did we get into this 
Just luck I guess, it's not like me 
Oh girl don't turn and walk away from it 
Communicate
