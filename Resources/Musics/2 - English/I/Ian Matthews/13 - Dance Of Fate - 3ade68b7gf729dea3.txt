DANCE OF FATE

We call it love, it may be so 
It might be love, for al I know 
We call it love, and we pay the price 
Apologise, yes and compromise 

We call it love, but it don't take much 
To wake up feeling like it's not enough 

It's just an everyday, 
In every way, 
Just an everyday revelation 

We call it love, this dance of fate 
Around and around we go, 
Until someone breaks 
We call it love, but stil I find, 
What's on my lips, is rarely on my mind 

It's just an everyday, 
In every way, 
Just an everyday revelation 

We call it love, this dance of fate 
Around and around we go, 
Until someone breaks 

It's just an everyday, 
In every way, 
Just an everyday revelation 

It's just an everyday, 
And in every way, 
Just an everyday revelation
