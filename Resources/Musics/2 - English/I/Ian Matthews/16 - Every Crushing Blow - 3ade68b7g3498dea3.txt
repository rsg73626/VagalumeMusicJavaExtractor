EVERY CRUSHING BLOW

You know when you go back to that place 
That you left in such a hurry 
Your heart remebers everything so clear 
And you'd love to rerun all the times 
When you could have said I'm sorry 
Then you spot that car same colour make and year 

You know that song about leaving on 
The midnight train to Georgia 
I can't stop it running through my mind 
So what is all this hesitation 
Goahead and call her 
But you know she's not coming back this time 

We run so far when it's time to go 
We fall so hard with every crushing blow 
'Til there is no light  it's all we know 
We fall so hard and we learn so slow 

Now it's why and how and what if you'd just 
Learned to face the music 
Leaving always complicates this life 
You know when you go back to that place 
You left in such confusion 
And everything just seemed so black and white
