IF IT'S NOT ONE THING

If it isn't our last warning, then what is it 
Is mother nature laying down to die 
If we had to start again from the beginning, you and I 

Would we really have the faith to move a mountain 
If we covered every angle in the book 
Do you realize how long we have been dangling on this hook 

If it's not about the winding Orinoco 
And it's not about the feuds that never stop 
If it isn't for our childrens' childrens' children 
Well, then what 

You don't need an invitation 
You don't need a passion or a cause 
You just need the inclination, it's yours 

If we make it to the turning of this century 
If we make it to this magic carpet ride 
If we can change our twisted way of thinking 
We'll survive 

But you say you're only living for the minute 
You say we'll never change it over night 
You say if it's not one thing, it's another 
Man, you're right 
You say if it's not one thing it's another 
WeIl, you're right
