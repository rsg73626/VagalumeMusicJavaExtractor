THE POWER OF BLUE

Ridiculous, it's getting so ridiculous 
I need to kick myself 
Before you do 
Impossible, ii's practically impossible 
To find myself a hole 
To crawl on through 
Let's just get one thing straight 
You don't underestimate 
The power of blue 

Ridiculous, it'sgetting so ridiculous 
We're not talking kids' stuff 
We're talking taboo 
Fortunate, you know, I guess we're kinda fortunate 
We know how to put an end to it 
At least you do 
I know you'll disagree 
But nobody's saving me 
From the power of blue 

Ridiculous, it's getting so ridiculous 
You need to call my bluff, you know that's true 
Anytime, stop down and see me anytime 
And meet this friend of mine 
He's a lot like you 
The question is why, of course 
Signed regretfully yours 
The power of blue
