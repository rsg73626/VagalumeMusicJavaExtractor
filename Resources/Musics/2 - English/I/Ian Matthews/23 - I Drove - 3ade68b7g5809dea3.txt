I DROVE

I drove into the fading light 
Until there were no cars in sight 
Until there was no center stripe. 
I drove 
Eyes fixed on the road ahead 
My rnind convinced of what it's fed 
I could have turned around 
Instead. I drove 
Just put yourself into my shoes 
Consider all the avenues 
All the don'ts and all the what 
you does 
When everything she ever said 
Carved lazy circles in your head 
Some things are better left for dead 
And nothing you can say will 
change that 

I drove until I met the dawn 
The questions in my mind's eye formed 
My sense of space and time 
Were gone without me 
I drove beneath the desert sun 
Just contemplating why we run 
The sign said US Highway 31 
When time allowed and time between 
Are seldom heard or rarely seen 
Imagine it's a time machine or 
something 
Asplinter of the life we spend 
Together measured end to end 
Is equal to the time it takes 
To rock your little world and say I 
knew that 
  

Anxiety, my shotgun friend 
Would not shift or fade or bend 
Steered my rnind from start to end, 
I drove 

I reached the point of no return, 
my body ached, my spirit burned 
All objections overturned,I drove 
I drove until the passion died 
Then I popped the clutch and let 
her glide 
As all that stuff unglued inside of me 
you start to wonder what it is 
That locks the hand into a fist 
And dives into that little twist of fate 
A penny earned, a penny wise 
Holy Jesus, damn your eyes 
When conversation slowly dies 
Takes that long to realize she means it 

I drove into the fading night 
Until there were no stars in sight 
Until there was no center stripe 
Until there was no center stripe 
I drove
