BREAK A WINDOW, BREAK A HEART

If I ever lose my mind 
and find I'm out of line 
If a night would see me gone 
and lost with all the wine 

If I ever lose my wings 
and find that I can fly 
Come the day of reckoning 
at least you'll know I tried 

Tell me, was it a game 
Tell me, who's in a daze 
There's a way, and I've known it from the start 
Break a window, break a heart 

If I ever lose my mind 
and find the coast is clear 
Come the day of reckoning 
at least you'll know I cared 

If I ever lose my fear 
and find I'm still at sea 
If a night would see me drown 
in all our history 

Tell me, was it a game 
Tell me, who's in a daze 
There's a way, and I've known it from the start 
Break a window, break a heart 
That's a way, and I've known it from the start 
Break a window, break a heart
