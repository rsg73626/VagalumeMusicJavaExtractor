THE DARK RIDE

So I got up and I checked the door 
It was nothing more than fear 
I waited 'til I really knew for sure 
And the pain disappeared 

I heard you moved up to the rain 
and snow 
Drew a bitter line between us 
If I saw you now you'd surely know 
It took a lot of miles to free us 

Don't leave me dangling 
Don't end it here 
Don't leave me dangling so near 

So I got up and I wrote a line 
It'll come in time, it's my song 
I saw the misery I'd hid inside 
And I let it hide for so long 

Refrão

I heard you found a way to pass the time 
With a friend of mine no doubt 
Here the river it keeps thundering 
And I would rather drown than shout 

Refrão
