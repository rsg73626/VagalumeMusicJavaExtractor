HORSE LEFT IN THE RAIN

I have screamed for mercy 
I have learned the long goodbye 
I'm soaked in controversy 
I have moved to mystify you 
I'm not a bitter man 
I'm not a lucky man 
I'm just a shadow across your mind 

I've been kissed by lightening 
I have brushed the hurricane 
I have been divided 
and I could be them all again 
I'm not a bitter man 
I'm not a lucky man 
I'm just a moth cought in the flame 

Tell me who I am 
Tell me what you see 
I can understand, if you're sick of me 

I have cause to wonder 
how I missed that grand parade 
Did my boat slide under 
as I turned to walk away 
I'm not a bitter man 
I'm not a lucky man 
I'm just a horse left in the rain 

I have screamed for mercy 
I have learned the long goodbye 
I'm steeped in controversy 
I have moved to mystify you 
I'm not a bitter man 
I'm not a lucky man 
I'm just a shadow across your mind 

I'm not a bitter man 
I'm not a lucky man 
I'm just a shadow across your mind 
I'm just a horse left in the rain 
I'm just a horse left in the rain
