BILLY BENTLEY (PROMENADES HIMSELF IN LONDON)

(One, two, three, four ........)
Hello, playmates
Here's a little London song
All about a young man's adventures in the big city
Here we go

Billy Bentley, bought to London early in the day
Half a quid, mate
Stand to reason
Hold your horses
How's your father?
Well, cor blimey
Wotcha, cheeky
Move along there
See the show, sir
Nice time, ducky
You'll be lucky
Billy Bentley, he's a course and a flippin' state

Billy Bentley, take your father in the afternoon
Down the Grove
Up the Archway
Kilburn High Road
Dalston Junction
Clapham Common
Ealing Broadway
Cambridge Circus
Hyde Park Corner
Covent Garden
I beg your pardon
Billy Bentley, golden platter and a dirty spoon

Billy Bentley, day in London soon to disappear
Shocking headache
Well despondent
Starving hungry
Bleeding taters
What a karma
Double lonely
Fucking Ada
All me marbles
Charming weather
Bloody clever
Billy Bentley, all the winners don't you like it here?

Hold very tight, please (ding ding)
