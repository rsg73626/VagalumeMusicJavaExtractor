QUIET

Excuse me, excuse me
Get right out of the way
Quiet! (plop-plops)

I'm sorry, beg pardon
The fault's entirely yours
Quiet! (big jobs)

Your Highness, your Worship
You silly pompous ass
Quiet! (ar-arse)

Quiet! You're making such a racket
Quiet! Why must you be so loud?
Quiet! It's costing me a packet
Quiet! Persistent louts and clowns

Hello there
How are you?
Pee off!
Quiet! (three drips)

Look, honest
Really
Lies
Quiet! (prune juice)

How lovely!
How charming!
Horrible
Quiet! (wee-wees)

Quiet! Or else there will be measures
Quiet! Stop this unholy row
Quiet! Shut up, you little treasures
Quiet! When you've been told, and how

Alright little chap
Get back on mummy's lap
There may well be chastisements if you do not shut your trap
Just sit quite still
Fold arms face front

Quiet! You're making such a din din
Quiet! Why don't you please keep quiet?
Quiet! No one else is listening
Quiet! Utterly sick and tired

Quiet!

Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh
