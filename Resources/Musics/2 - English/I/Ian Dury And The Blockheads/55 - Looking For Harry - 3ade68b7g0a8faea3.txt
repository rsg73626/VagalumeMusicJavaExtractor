LOOKING FOR HARRY

Looking for Harry
Looking for Harry
Looking for Harry
Looking for Harry
Looking for Harry
Have you seen him around?

The minute I find him
I'm going to unwind him
It's time to remind him
Not to put me behind him
Looking for Harry
Perhaps he's gonna come round

Loving me is going to be
Beautiful, beautiful
All night long
Beautiful, beautiful
All night long

Checking for Johnny
Checking for Johnny
Checking for Johnny
Checking for Johnny
Checking for Johnny
Oh, wherever's he been?

Been trying to bell him
In order to tell him
The minute I smell him
I'm going to unshell him
Checking for Johnny
Since he's been off the scene

Loving me is going to be
Beautiful, beautiful
All night long
Loving me is going to be
Beautiful, beautiful
All night long
All night long
All night long...
