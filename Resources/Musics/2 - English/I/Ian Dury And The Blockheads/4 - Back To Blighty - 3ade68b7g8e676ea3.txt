BACK TO BLIGHTY

when faced with a hinderance
the brave mountainier
turns and walks back into the wind
but my hesitation
in strange hemisphere
makes me quit before I begin

intrepid explorer
his reason extremes
persues the unknwo we perefect aplone
behaves like a trooper
who brags and blasphemes
tell the truth, I wanna go home

back to blighty
back to blighty
back to blighty
back to blighty

the poor navagator
the siren that calls
hes not a warning of coming distressed
although youre a chamer
the prospect appals
going back to my former address

back to blighty
back to blighty
back to blighty
back to blighty

there is a green hill far away....
