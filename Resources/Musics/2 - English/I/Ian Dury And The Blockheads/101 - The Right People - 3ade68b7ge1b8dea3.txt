THE RIGHT PEOPLE

People think it's easy being a crook
But I got done for everything I took
There's people who could keep you out of schtuck
But you've had it if you don't know where to look

People think it's easy being a thief
But all my major tickles came to grief
The only way your talent is revealed
Is working with the top men in their field

It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people

People think you've only got to ask
Turn up with your crowbar and your mask
"Good morning, I'm a burglar. What's the haps?"
Well, you've had it if you haven't met the chaps

It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people

It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people

It's hard to find the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
It's hard to find, the right people
