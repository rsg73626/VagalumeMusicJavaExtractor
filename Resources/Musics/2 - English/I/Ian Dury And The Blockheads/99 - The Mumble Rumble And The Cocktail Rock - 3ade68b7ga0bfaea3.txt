THE MUMBLE RUMBLE AND THE COCKTAIL ROCK

Woke up this morning in a state of shock
I heard a mumble rumble and a cocktail rock
???? beat like a slide trombone
Goddess Diana plicking all alone

It's the mumble rumble
And the cocktail rock
You did the mumble rumble
And the cocktail rock
You do the m-m-m-mumble rumble
Cocktail rock

Ive laid around the weary drain
The mumble rumble got me up again
I climbed out of bed, I call a doc.
I don't need you

The mumble rumble
And the c-c-c-c-c-c-cocktail rock
I got the mumble rumble
And the c-c-c-c-c-c-cocktail rock
The m-m- mumble rumble
Cocktail rock

Well now I'm fit, I'm ready to go
My mumble fast, my cocktail slow
I'll keep mine going around the clock
M-m-m-m-mumble

The mumble rumble
And the c-c-c-c-c-c-
I got the mumble rumble
And the c-c-c-c-c-c-
The m-m-m-mumble rumble
Cocktail rock

Well now I'm fit, I'm ready to go
My mumble fast, my cocktail slow
I'll keep mine going around the clock
M-m-m-m-mumble

The mumble rumble
And the c-c-c-c-c-c-
I got the mumble rumble
And the c-c-c-c-c-c-
The m-m-m-mumble rumble
Cocktail rock
