LULLABY FOR FRANC(I/E)S

Go to sleep now, Frances
You've done all you can with the day
Safe and sound, that's a promise
You'll be welcome in the Milky Way

Tumble down, tired and true
Spirit to restore, a balance is due

Go to sleep now, Frances
Close your eyes

Hang your thoughts up, shut the index
It's time to impose a curfew
And you'll get up, fresh and ready
With a hundred and one things to do

Drowsy now, here comes a space
Call a halt to the steeple chase
Go to sleep, Frances
Close your eyes

If your life or some old lover cause concern
Or puzzle or perturb
The more you discover, the more you learn
Go to sleep, please do not disturb

Tumble down, tired and true
Spirit to restore, a balance is due
Go to sleep now, Frances
Close your eyes

Go to sleep now, Frances
Close your eyes
Go to sleep now, Frances
Go to sleep
Frances
