FUNKY DISCO (POPS)

I'll take you to the pictures
I'll take you to the show
Walking in the sunshine
Rolling in the snow
Stepping from the threshold
Out into the street
All you ought to do, my love,
Is dancing with your feet

To those funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky disco pops
Oh!

I went to see the doctor
Not so long ago
I told her all about you
I put her in the know
Tried to get you treatment
I didn't stand a chance
She turned on her radio
And she did the doctor's dance

To those funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky disco pops

When doctor doctors another doctor,
is the doctor doing the doctoring
doctor the doctor who's being doctored?
Just as the doctor being doctored wants to be doctored
Or does the doctor doing the doctoring
doctor the doctor who's being doctored?
Just as the doctor who's doing the doctoring wants to do the doctoring
Do the doctoring
Do the doctoring

I long to take you courting
but bopping is the boss
Hugging makes you angry
Kissing makes you cross
Your only installation
Is booty in the seat
In this position your disposition
Is always very sweet

Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky disco pops

Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky disco pops, funky disco pops
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky disc
