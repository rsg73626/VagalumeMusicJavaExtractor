YOU'RE MY BABY

Every day I look at you
And every day there's something new
About you
When I look into your eyes
There's many things I recognise
About you
Every time I hold your hand
I'm learning how to understand
About you
Got more than love enough to spare
And I'm not going anywhere
Without you
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby

Come excursions or alarms
I'll be there to put my arms
Around you
The joy I get to see you smile
There'll be gladness all the while
Around you
Proudly at your beck and call
I'll make sure that love is all
Around you
Loving you is purity
Blankets of security
Surround you
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby

Every day I look at you
And every day there's something new
About you
Got more than love enough to spare
And I'm not going anywhere
Without you
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
You're my baby
