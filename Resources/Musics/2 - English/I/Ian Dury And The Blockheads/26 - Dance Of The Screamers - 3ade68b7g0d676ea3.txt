DANCE OF THE SCREAMERS

So im screaming this to you -waaaaaaagh- 
From thr last place in the queue -waaah-, -waaah- 
I really think youd liek me given half a chance 
But since we aint got that ill do the screamers dance 

Some of us are ugly angel, some of us are only small 
Some of us are useless sailor, they havent got the where-with-all 
We went and missed the ending babe, we never quite caught the bus 
We never speak our minds my love, we aint got nothing to discuss 

Some of us are useless luv, it comes from facing up to facts 
Its hard to be a hero handsome, when youve had your helmet cracked 
Cheerfulness is catching sweetie, when the fevers you have got 
Weve got a tempreture my dear, but we simpley havent got the hots 

So im screaming this to you -waaaaaaagh- 
Silly season, skys are blue -waah-, -waah- -waah - 
I hardly ever think, ive made a small advance 
I keep my elbows in and do the screamers dance 
DANCE!! 

-Wawl-, Some of us are stupid sister, some of us are very shy 
Some of us get nervuos chicken, when you look us in the eye 
We're ever so pathetic, chickie, we know quite well that we try too hard
Some of us were born like this while others got it by the yard 

So im screaming this to you -waaaaaaagh- 
Coz I havent got a clue -wuuaaarrh- 
I really think id like you given half the chance 
As we ain;t got that ill do the screamers dance 
-Waaaaaaagh- -waaaaaaagh- 
-Waaaaaaagh- -waaaaaaagh- 
-Waaaaaaagh-
