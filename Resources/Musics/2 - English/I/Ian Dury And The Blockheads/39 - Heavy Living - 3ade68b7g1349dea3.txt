HEAVY LIVING

Heavy living is the life that I've led
See the daylight through a curtain of red
Stands to reason why I'm staying in bed
Heavy living off the top of my head
Heavy living, uh, I know it too well
Every creak on the stairway to Hell
Double vision and a terrible smell
Heavy living at the hard luck hotel


Heavy sausage is the price you pay
When you're on a corroder
Heavy bangers is another way
To let yourself go
Heavy living's the condition I'm in
I wished I hadn't if I knew where I'd been
The air is cold, the membrane is thin
Heavy living's getting under my skin


Heavy sausage is the price you pay
At the café doolally
Heavy bangers has a special way
Of saying hello
Heavy cricket on a cloudy day
Heavy chukkas till the close of play
Heavy living is the way I'll stay
As if I don't know


Heavy living is the life that I've led
Passion spent, nobility fled
Stands to reason why I'm staying in bed
Heavy living off the top of my head


Heavy shitters is the price you pay when
You're on a corroder
Heavy bangers is another way
To let yourself go
Heavy make-up for the matinée
Heavy curtains at the cabaret
Heavy living is the way I'll stay
As if I don't know


Heavy sausage is the dish of the day
Heavy bangers on the roundelay
Heavy living is the way I'll stay,
As if I don't know
