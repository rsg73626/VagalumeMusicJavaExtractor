LOVE IS ALL

When ecstasy ennobled our first kiss
I fell into an agony of bliss
I've never heard a person talk like this
I hope you don't think you can take the piss

The exhilaration of your touch
Ensnares my heart within its vice-like clutch
Now that may be a compliment as such
I'm not sure that I like you very much

Come to my arms
So put your hands
Oh, cherished love
Where they belong
As spirits soar
Although it's cruel
To worlds above
You must be strong
And while we play
Stop talking bullshit
Our hearts be true
In my ear
This perfect dream
You're not my cup
Of me and you
Of tea I fear
Cos love is all
Oh no it ain't
Love is all

The sweet unbridled urges you evoke
My fevered brow is bursting till I choke
Although you seem to think you're quite a bloke
I wouldn't want you - even for a joke

Come to my arms
So put your hands
Oh, cherished love
Where they belong
As spirits soar
Although it's cruel
To worlds above
You must be strong
And while we play
Stop talking bollocks
Our hearts be true
In my ear
This perfect dream
You're not my cup
Of me and you
Of tea I fear
Cos love is all
Oh no it ain't
Love is all

Love is all
Oh no it ain't
Love is all

I've just this minute got out of the mood
I wonder, could you show me to the Tube?
The understanding, it is just because
The Underground is where it always was

Come to my arms
Seeing it's you
My new-found love
I might as well
As spirits soar
You're all I've got
To worlds above
So what the hell
And while we play
In you or me
Our hearts be true
To hold you near
This perfect dream
Stop talking bullshit
Of me and you
In my ear
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all...
