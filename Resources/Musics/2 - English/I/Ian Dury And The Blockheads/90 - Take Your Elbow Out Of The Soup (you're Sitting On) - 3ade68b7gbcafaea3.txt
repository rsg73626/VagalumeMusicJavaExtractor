TAKE YOUR ELBOW OUT OF THE SOUP (YOU'RE SITTING ON)

To be simple and wise
Never tell lies
Always pick on someone my own size
Would be quite a thing
And when I make it swing
Ill write you a letter or Ill give you a ring

Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the chicken
Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the chicken
Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the chicken
Holding you tight is extremely all right
If aint called love then it aint like a light, sailor

To be sweet and true
To the likes of you
A promise that time will not undo
Would be truly smart
And when I make a start
Ill come and pick you up in my horse and cart

The mouse runs up your leg, its 1 Oclock in china
The mouse runs up your leg, ooh, its 1 Oclock in china
The mouse runs up your leg, oh, its 1 Oclock in china
Oh for the wings of a dove, goodness me, Im in love

Are they shut or open? Always all around you close
And theres poor darling and I love you
And I might one who cares

Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the kittens
Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the kittens
Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the kittens
Take your elbow out of the soup, youre sitting on the kittens

To be simple and wise...
