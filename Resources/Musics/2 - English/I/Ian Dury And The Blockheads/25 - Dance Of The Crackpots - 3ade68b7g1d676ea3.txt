DANCE OF THE CRACKPOTS

Oh, let's get up and let's get excited
It's a public party and you're all invited
Let's cut the custard, see the mustard
Please hold steady till we're maladjusted
Sing boop-ba-de-boop, sing twiddle-de-de
Invite the Germans home for tea
Let them mock and let them sneer
The wise young crackpot knows no fear

The emancipation that's sweeping the nation
When it seemed the world was sunk
You can bet your boots on your own pursuits
History is bunk

Let them stop and let them snore
We'll be glad that we were born

Motivation is the new sensation
The fantasy that keeps you fit
On the human assumption, you don't have the gumption
Get up and do your bit

Which sharpens up your wits
Totally enthusic about the music
and it shows in the face you sit, sit, sit

Oh, let's get up and let's get excited
It's a public party and you're all invited
Let's cut the custard, see the mustard
Please hold steady till we're maladjusted
Sing boop-ba-de-boop, sing twiddle-de-de
Invite the Germans home for tea
Let them mock and let them sneer
Wise young crackpots know no fear

Emancipation that's sweeping the nation
Worldwide tonic funk
You can bet your b
