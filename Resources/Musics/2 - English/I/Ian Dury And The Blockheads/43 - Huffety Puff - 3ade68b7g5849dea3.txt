HUFFETY PUFF

Huffety Puff do I love you enough?
Was it nice and slow or a little bit rough?
Amazes me when you do your stuff
You're so kind and I'm so tough

When the base is run and you're in the pack 
Do the lap of honour all around the track
When you're nothing done in the stadium
Do the lap of honour all around again

Twiddle-de-de is how it ought to be
When I rock and roll in your company
I keep the beat but I leave it free
Gonna win a medal if you medal with me

When the base is run and you're in the pack
Do the lap of honour all around the track
When you're nothing done in the stadium
Do the lap of honour all around again

Bip-ity-bop, I just can't stop
A poor old heart go clippety-clop
Well you came in first and stayed on top
Did the lap of honour 'til you had to drop

When the base is run and you're in the pack 
Do the lap of honour all around the track
When you're nothing done in the stadium
Do the lap of honour all around again

Huffety Puff do I love you enough?
Was it nice and slow or a little bit rough?
Amazes me when you do your stuff
You're so kind and I'm so tough

When the base is run and you're in the pack 
Do the lap of honour all around the track
When you're nothing done in the stadium
Do the lap of honour all around again
