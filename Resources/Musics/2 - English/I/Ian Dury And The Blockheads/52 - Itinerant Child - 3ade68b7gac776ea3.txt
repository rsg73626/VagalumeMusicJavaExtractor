ITINERANT CHILD

I took out all the seats and away I went
its a right old banger and the chassis bent
its got a great big peace sign across the back
and most of the windos have been painted black

the windshields cracked, its a bugger to drive
it starts making smoke over forty-five
its a phsychedelic nightmare with a million leaks
its home-sweet-home to ssome sweet arse freaks

slow down itinerant child, the road is full of danger
slow down itinerant child, theres no more welcome, stanger

soon I was rumbling through the mornign fog
with my long haired children and my one eyed dog
with the trucks and the buses and the trailer-vans
my long throw horns playing Steely Dan

we straggled out for miles along the Beggars Hill
when the word came donw that wed lost Old Bill
you can bet your boots im coming when the times are hard
thats why they keep my dossier at Scotland Yard

slow down itinernat child, youre still accelerating
slow down itinerant child, the boys in blue were waiting
itinernat child dont do what your doing
itinerant child youd better slow down

we drove into Happy Valley seeking peace and love
with a lone helicopter hanging up above
we didnt realise untill we hit the feild
there were four hundred cozzers holding riot sheilds

they terrorized our babies and they broke our heads
its a stone fucking miracle theres no-one dead
they turned my ramshackle home into a burning wreck
my one-eyed dog got a broken neck

slow down itinerant child, the road is full of danger
slow down itinerant child, theres no more welcome, stanger
slow down itinernat child, youre still accelerating
slow down itinerant child, the boys in blue were waiting
