COWBOYS

They say its tough out there and thats for sure
You pay your way twice over if not more
They say thats the proce of fame, and now youve made your name
Your freinds dont even treat you like they used to do before
They quote the man stars whove died so young
From the fermament you seek to walk among
They tell you who went mad, who went from good to bad
And they warn you of the dangers that await the highly strung

Who the hell are they?
And who cares what they say?
Who only seek to worry and alarm
Dont give those dogs thier day
Dont let them get thier way
Cos I can see that fames done you no harm

They say what you sacrifeced to be the best
Did you loose all other perpose in your quest?
They say that fames your only goal and it messes up your soul
And they mension Elvis Presley and youre supposed to know the rest
They tell you cherish every minute that youre hot
So at least yourll have some memories when youre not
They say wehn fame becomes dispair, you abandon what you learn
Which makes it that much harded to give up what youve got

Who the hell are they?
And who cares what they say?
Who only deal in envy and dismay
Dont give those dogs thier day
Dont let them get thier way
Im glad to see your picture everywhere

They say celebrity extracts a heavy tole
That the devil soon appears to take control
They say it leads you by the nose and they resite the names of those
Who bled apon the alter of the demon rock n roll

Who the hell are they?
And who cares what they say?
Who only seek to worry and alarm
Dont give those dogs thier day
Dont let them get thier way
Cos I can see that fames done you no harm
