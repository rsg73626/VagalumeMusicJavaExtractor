THE ROADETTE SONG

Shaken on her shoulder
Shaking on her arse
Ain't no doubt about it
She's a gamey lass
Jerking with her elbow
Clever with her knee
Way she move it over
That's the place to please
Diction very bad
Friction double rich
Brazen little hussy
Rock 'n' rolling bitch
When it come to business
Take off like a jet
Rocking's her vocation
She's a very high roadette

Young man
There ain't no need to hustle
Young man
Slow down your hustle bustle
You can take your time, young man
Some of this is muscle

Lightning in her leg
Spitfire on her hip
Rock 'n' roll's a habit
Guitar wrote the script
Messed up on her history
Won the scoring prize
Does her heavy thinking
Bristols under thighs
Never had a teacher
Messing with her brain
You should see her pupils
Music's in her veins
Shifting her transmission
Shipped a new corvette
Rock 'n' roll relations
With a very high roadette

Young man

Shaken on her shoulder
Shaking on her arse
Ain't no doubt about it
She's a gamey lass
Jerking with her elbow
Clever with her knees
Way she move it over
That's the place to please
Diction very bad
Friction double rich
Brazen little hussy
Rock 'n' rolling bitch
When it come to business
Take off like a jet
Rocking's her vocation
She's a very high roadette

Young man
There ain't no need to hustle
Young man
Slow down your hustle bustle
You can take your time, young man
Some of this is muscle
