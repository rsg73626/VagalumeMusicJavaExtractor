CLEVER TREVOR

just cos I aint never ad, no, nothing worth having
never ever, never ever
you aint got no call not to think I wouldnt fall
into thinking that I aint too clever
and it aint not having oen thing nor another
niether, either is it anything, whatever
and its not not knowing that thier aint nothign showing
and I answer to the name of Trever, however

Just cos I aint never said, no, nothing worth saying
never ever, never ever, never ever
things ave got read into what I never sad, till me mouth becomes me ead
which aint not all that clever
and its not not saying one thing nor another
neither, either is ist anything I havent said, whatever
and it aint not proving that me mind aint moving
and I answer to the naem of Trever, however

knock me down with a feather
Clever Trevor
widebrows wonder wether Clever Trevors clever
either have they got
nor neither havent not
got no right to make a clot
our of Trevor

why should I feel bad about something I aint ad
such stupidness is mad cos nothing underfoot
comes to nothing less to add to a load of old toot
and I aint half not half co theres nowhere to put it
even if I ad im a bit of a Jack the Lad

knock me down with a feather
Clever Trevor
widebrows wonder wether Clever Trevors clever
either have they got
nor neither havent not
got no right to make a clot
our of Trevor

also, it takes much longer to get up north, the slow way
