UNCOOLOHOL

The war cry of the raging drunken sot 
That sends unwelcome pangs right up your bot 
It bellows forth from open windows all night long 
Puts up on the thought of right and wrong 

Uncoolohol 
Uncoolohol 

The war cry of the drinker of the drink 
Can send your senses reeling to the brink 
What's your poison breath and outlook 
Puke and bile 
Lose all sense of reason, humour, style

Uncool 

The war cry of the boozer of the booze 
In normal state of little left to lose 
Pissed and witless blood and bandage 
Not a care 
Splashing noxious liquids everywhere
