SUEPERMAN'S BIG SISTER

Till I met her, I thought I knew the answers
I thought a bit of treatment was all a body needs
I'll take you where the haps are
All the handsome chaps are
Squeeze you till I make your feelings bleed

She put me right behind her in fifteen minutes
She could have had my things off, so sadly was I raised
I had a lot to learn, dear
If I'd gone on the turn, dear
It wouldn't be surprising nowadays

You know she's Sueperman's big sister
Her X-ray eyes see through my silly ways
Sueperman's big sister, superior skin and blister
It doesn't seem surprising nowadays... yeah!

Superman's big sister
(oh-oh-oo-oh)
Superman's big sister
(oh-oh-oo-oh)
Superman's big sister
(oh-oh-oo-oh)
Superman's big sister
(oh-oh-oo-oh)
I said she's Sueperman's big sister
It doesn't seem surprising nowadays

And now I've had the sense to keep her friendship
And though I nearly miffed it in many little ways
The story's got no sequel
Cos me and her are equal
Is that so surprising nowadays?

Because she's Sueperman's big sister
Her X-ray eyes see through my silly ways
I said she's Sueperman's big sister, his grown up skin and blister
Is that so surprising nowadays?
