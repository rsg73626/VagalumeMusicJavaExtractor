BILL HALEY'S LAST WORDS

(Rock, roc,k rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)

Alright! I'm calling you from Harlingen, Texas
I'm telling you, friend, that I've got a son named Scott Haley
Alright? You know all that jive, don't you, Jack?

We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna bop, gonna rock, around the clock tonight

I'm gonna have Captain Buddy Larrymore, the Chief of Police call you
'Cos now I've got your number
But you don't wanna listen, do you?

If a bobby needs a buddy, fucking from the right
If a body needs a buddy, make me sing it

I've got a lawyer in Philadelphia
I've got several lawyers in Philadelphia
I've got one of the things on Valley Brook
You tell me about the six foot seven guy that runs my publishing company

Thirteen women only one man around
There were thirteen women, only one running around

You tell me I didn't have the biggest Mexican record in Mexico?
Now, you see I collect loyalty from Mexico too, friend
'Cos I sing in the two languages

Everybody razzle-dazzle
Everybody razzle-dazzle
Everybody razzle-dazzle
The whole night through

I'm gonna have Captain Buddy Larrymore to call you
And if you want his phone number I'm gonna give it to you
You call him and tell him what you just heard
And he's gonna ask you how you got his phone number
And you're gonna be in jail

Hot-dog, maya maya
Hot-dog, maya maya
Hot-dog, maya maya
Hot-dog, all the time

Now, you'll keep your mouth shut, won't you?
'Cos I'm gonna give you a number in Miami Beach
And he'll shut your mouth
I seem to carry a little more weight tonight than I did, don't I?

He man, ho, the mambo rock
He man, ho, the mambo rock
He man, ho, the mambo rock
Everybody doing the mambo rock

Now, you hang on and wait just a second on this toll free line
Goodbye, don't ever call me, you don't have my number
I didn't give you any numbers
You cannot let Bill Hayley say anything and keep his mouth shut

Now, can I talk?
And when I'm finished talking then you can open your mouth
I do remember Philadelphia
Where's Buddy Larrymore? He's in Sicily
So if you see Lenny, tell him I wish you a Merry Christmas

See you later, Alligator
In a mambo bar
See you later, Alligator
In a mambo bar
