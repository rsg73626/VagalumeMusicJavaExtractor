(YOU'RE MY) INSPIRATION

Darling (yes, darling?)
Nothing, darling
Just darling, darling

You're my inspiration, so welcome to my heart
Since making your acquaintance I've made a brand new start
I'm telling you I love you, what else can I say?
'Cos you're my inspiration in every single way

You're always optimistic, you never be blas√©
And when I'm in a moody you make it go away
I've never had a minute of horrible jealousy, jealousy
Anyone that you like will be okay with me

'Cos you're my inspiration, my reason and my rhyme
From the first impressions until the end of time
I'm telling you I love you, what else can I say?
'Cos you're my inspiration in every single way

Well darling, that just about sums things up
And I'm sure you know by now, I think you're very special
So (lower darling) So..... snarling darling? (stop it pet), alright

(Inspiration)

You're my inspiration, my reason and my rhyme
From the first impressions until the end of time
I'm telling you I love you, what else can I say?
'Cos you're my inspiration in every single way

(Inspiration)

Since making your acquaintance (inspiration) the world's a better place (inspiration)
Your confidence is catching (inspiration) I can feel it in my face (inspiration)
It's almost out of order (inspiration) so beautiful with you (inspiration)

'Cos you're my inspiration (inspiration, inspiration)
You're my inspiration (inspiration, inspiration)
You're my inspiration (inspiration, inspiration)
