ALL THOSE WHO SAY OK

All those who say okay, say okay, okay
All those who say okay, say okay, exactly
All those who say okay, say okay, okay
All those who say okay, say okay, exactly

Oh, I see you're reading a book
Have you got to page one yet?

Can you spell your name forwards?

Can you, can you tell me the way straight on, please?

You're so stupid, you don't know you're not asking about what you don't know about
And now you're confused as well if you've got any sense at all - which I doubt

You're so lazy it's a wonder you haven't been castigated by the less fortunate for wasting your God given talents
Well, now you have, sucker

You couldn't hold a floor if you were laying on it

You're so negative that you've become a transparency which nobody wishes to view

Can you tell me one thing you can do with a pencil?
Make a stencil?

You're so selfish that if you had anything to say you'd keep it to yourself

If you were going somewhere, would you start from here?

How many beans make five, sucker?

(gibberish)
Oh, well done!

Philosophy? Horrible thought

Steady on!

I resemble that remark!


(gibberish)
That is it, n'est-ce pas? A-ha
n'est-ce pas? A-ha
(gibberish)
in my trouser
(gibberish)
Stop!
