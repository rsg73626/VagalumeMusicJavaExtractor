COMMON AS MUCK

You're not Bridget Bardot, I'm not Jack Palance.
I'm not Shirley Temple by any circumstance,
Or Fred Astaire---

You're not Sidney Taffler, I'm not Dirk Bogarde.
I'm not very stylish, and you're not avant garde,
Or Lional Blair---

We're as common as muck.
??? ??? ??? ???  Good luck!
Where bold is beautiful, we don't give a damn--.
Love a duck! We're as common as muck.

You're not Victor Hugo, I'm not Patience Strong,
I'm not Rodney Rygate or Yvonne Goolagong.
Shirley Abicair--         Oh!

I'm not Nellie Melba, you're not Nellie Dean
We do our best endeavours to keep our newbies? clean
Because we care!

We're as common as muck.
??? ??? ??? ???  Good luck!
Where bold is beautiful, we don't give a damn.
Love a duck! We're as common as muck.

We're as common as muck.
??? ??? ??? ???  Good luck!
Where bold is beautiful, we don't give a damn.
Love a duck! We're as common as muck.

[??? = foreign language, probably 'good luck' in other languages]
