THE CALL-UP

Let her go, let her go
When the look in her eye said,
"Cheerio, cheerio"
"I don't want you no more"
"Mosquito, mosquito"
"Get the hell out of my bed"
"You know, torpedo"
"I don't want you no more"

Join up

And join up
And sign up
Go to the call up it's all up with you

With regret, with regret
When the lady departed
Cigarette, cigarette
Can I see you once more?
Bayonet, bayonet
When the trouble had started
Tournequet, tournequet
Can I see you once more?

Can't defend my intended
You regroup, you regroup
I don't want you no more

The engagement has ended
Parachute, parachute
I don't want you no more
