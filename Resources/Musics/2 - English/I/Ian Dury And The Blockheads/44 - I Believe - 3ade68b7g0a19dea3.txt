I BELIEVE

I believe in bottle banks
And beauty from within
I believe in saying thanks
And fresh air on the skin

I believe in healthy walks
As tonic for the feet
I believe in serious talks
And just enough to eat

That's what I believe
Although it seems naïve
I believe in Santa Claus
To give is to receive
That's what I believe

I believe in 'Bob-a-Job'
And life in outer space
I believe an open gob
Does nothing for your face

I believe in being nice
In spite of what you think
I believe in good advice
And not too much to drink

That's what I believe
(laughs) Surprising as it seems
I believe that happiness
Is well within our dreams

That's what I believe
Although it seems naïve
I believe that peace and love
Are there to be achieved

I believe in being fair
St. Pancras station from the air
I believe in taking care
Moonshine sparkles in your hair

I believe in being true
In everything you try to do
I believe in me and you
And I hope you share my point of view

I believe in being kind
Especially when it's hard
I believe an open mind
Can show a fine regard

I believe that manners make
A person good to know
I believe in birthday cake
And going with the flow

That's what I believe
As strange as it may be
I believe this attitude
Is good enough for me

That's what I believe
Although it seems naïve
I believe it simplifies
The tangled web we weave

That's what I believe

That's what I believe

That's what I believe

That's what I believe

That's what I believe

That's what I believe

(That's what I believe), That's what I believe

(That's what I believe), That's what I believe

(That's what I believe, That's what I believe, That's what I believe)
