O.K ROLAND

OK Roland
Made a fuzzy beaver hat
Oh yeah Roland
You're so very good at that
When you eat that chicken
You can make it sense a time
Got the needy seat
In the real mean style
Honking on the corner
In alligator shoes
Swallowed baby Sue
OK Roland

OK Roland
OK Roland
OK Roland
Alright Roland

OK Roland
In a better waterproof
Oh yeah, Roland
When your beauty hit the roof
Routy touty routy
When the upper bee do fly
Stretching time and gentlemen
Make it 'til you cry
Siren tell the hornet
Go and sting the bees
If you want a scare in all the land
She can have it

OK Roland
OK Roland
OK Roland
OK Roland
