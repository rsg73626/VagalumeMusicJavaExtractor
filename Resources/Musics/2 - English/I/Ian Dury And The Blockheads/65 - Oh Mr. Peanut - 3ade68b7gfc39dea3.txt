OH MR. PEANUT

Oi!, Rotten hat!
Where'd you get that hair-cut?
Brent Cross Shopping Centre? 
I bet your mother fed you with a catapult 

Oh, Mr. Shag Nasty 
A bit of give and take 
You call me a divvy 
And I think you're a snake!

Oh, Mr. Knitting Crouch 
Come on for heaven's sake 
Stick your finger up your nose 
'Cos you give me the ache!

Oh, Mr. Peanut 
I don't like you at all 
Not only are they poisonous 
But your eyes are much too small

Oh, Mr. Pastry Draws 
You haven't got a clue 
So stick you finger up your nose 
And paint your money blue!

I saw Monsieur of course you must joking 
Oh yeah Mein Herr you must be up the creek 
What's more Signor the finger that you're poking 
That finger stands for reason so to speak

Oh, Mr. Horribleness 
That's enough of that 
You'll call me a ninny 
And you're a stupid twat!

Oh, Mr. Dog's Breath 
Why don't you piss right off!
Stick your finger up your nose, you toff 

I'm sure Monsieur I know that you're a jubbly 
Oh yeah Mein Herr for certainly you're cracked 
What's more Signor you look a little bit wobbly 
Let me suggest you put your finger back 

For all your life's offences you ain't nothing but a creep 
Your mouth is full of sugar, your guts are fast asleep 
So stick your finger up your nose and leave it there for keeps 
I hate you Mr Peanut you really make me weep

hahahaahaahahahahhahah
