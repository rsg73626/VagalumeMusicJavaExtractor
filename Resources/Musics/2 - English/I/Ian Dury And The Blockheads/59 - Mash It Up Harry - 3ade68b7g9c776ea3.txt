MASH IT UP HARRY

Hes got his little Y-fronts and his got his little vest
Hes got his little parting in his hair
Hes got his little trousers and hes got his little shoes
And he wants a bit of Wembley up you-know-where

Hes got his little jacket and hes got his little shirt
Hes got his little notif on his tie
Hes got his little raincoat and hes got his little hat
And he wants a bit of Wenbley up his I yi yi

Dont call Harry a human potato, dont call Harry a spud
Dont call Harry a walking King Edward, Harrys made of flesh and blood

Hes got his little office and hes got his little chair
Hes got his little cactus in its pot
Hes got his little memos and hes got his little job
And he wants a bit of Wembley up his you-know-what

Hes got his little pension and hes got his little plan
Hes got his little policy in hand
Hes got his little lap-top and hes got his little pen
And wants a bit of Wembley up his Rio Grande

Dont call Harry a human potato, dont fry Harry Tonight 
Dont give Harry a chip on his shoulder, Harrys doing alright

Mash it up, mash it up, mash it up Harry
Mash it up, mash it up, mash it up Harry
Mash it up, mash it up, mash it up Harry
Mash it up, mash it up, mash it up Harry

Hes got his little morgage and hes got his little lounge
Hes got his little bit of England to defend
Hes got his little telly and hes got his little phone
And he wants a bit of Wembley up his Ponders End

Hes got his little garden and hes got his little shed
Hes got his little mower on the grass
Hes got his little garage and hes got his little car
And he wants a bit of Wembley up his Khyber Pass

Dont call Harry a human Potato, dont roast him on a spike
I think Harrys a real Golden
