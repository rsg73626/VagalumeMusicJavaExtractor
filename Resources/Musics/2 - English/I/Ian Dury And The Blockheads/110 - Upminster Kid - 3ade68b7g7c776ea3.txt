UPMINSTER KID

When I was fifteen I had a black crepe jacket and sideboards to my chin
I used to go around in a two-tone Zephyr with a mean and nasty grin
Twelve-inch bottoms on my stardust flares and socks of dazzling green
Well Gene Vincent Craddock remembered the love of an Upminster rock 'n' roll teen

Well the silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down, oooooh
With a silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down
Amazing that the feeling's still around

My good friend Friar wore a powder-blue suit with criss-cross lurex thread
He turned seventeen bought a big motorcycle and started wearing leather instead
I could not afford a ruby snaffle tie or black suede clubbing shoes
Well Gene Vincent Craddock, the people still move
over when the Upminster Kid walked through

With a silver-dollar hairstyle, been cut down, oooooh
A silver-dollar hairstyle, been cut down
Amazing that the feeling's still around

Sunday afternoon at the Romford Geumont, alternte version 'strolling
down the road with my tight-sweater baby'
rum and black at the Bell Hotel
Hed strole into the park, for a chumber in the dark, little juvenile never-do-well
He'd run a steel comb along the Regent jukebox, a little bit of thieving now and then
Well Gene Vincent Craddock remembered to look on an Upminster kid again
alternate version well Gene VIncent Craddock i surely wish i were a Upminster Kid again

Well the silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down, ooooh
The silver-dollar hairstyle been cut down
Amazing that the feeling's still around

With a silver-dollar hairstyle, been cut down
With a silver-dollar hairstyle, been cut down
Amazing that the feeling's still around
