BROKEN SKIN

Share a good occasion
Hold the darkness in
Bear away abrasion
Free from broken skin
No pride is there to steal
Wounds that never heal

So close and there to wander
Confines wearing thin
Clear in where to squander
Such untroubled skin
Though ships will still collide
Tonight theyre side by side

Sources of affection
Mine have never been
I'm in your collection
Born with broken skin
