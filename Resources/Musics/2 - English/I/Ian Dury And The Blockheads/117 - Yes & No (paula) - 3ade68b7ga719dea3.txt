YES & NO (PAULA)

Hey Paula, come here
When I see you not to look at
And all that and so on
And that's a fact and so forth
And all that and thereabouts
And that's the truth
And not to look at either
No fear

You think I'm wrong I think
I think you're right
I think I think you're wrong
You think I think I think
And then again again
And then and then
And then and then
Again again and then
And then again again
And then and then again
Again again again
And if not why not
If
And if not why why
Why not
And if not why not
Of course it might be old
Course it might be busy
Being as it might be
As it could be new

 

Hey Paula
I'm hoping desperately
You will take me to see a good
And also you and me might want to share a flat together
If I get one fitted


And if not why not not
Not if or why
Or if not not
And then again again again
First thing first thing first thing to go
And why not if not if not why not why if not if if why why why

Yes and no
Yes and no
Yes and no

 

I'm not Jack Palance


Have you got a party hat?
Can't you show more restraint?
Have you got a clarinet?
Have you got a box of paint?
Yes and no
Yes and no
Yes and no
What what what what what what what what what what what what
what what what what what what what what what what what what
