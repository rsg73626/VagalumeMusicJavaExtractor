HAVE A WORD

Gotta sign the rent book
Gotta do the laundry
Then there's the electric
The water and the gas
Haven't stopped moaning
Since we had the phone in
The television rental
Another bloody hass

Go up to the top of a very high mountain
Go up to the top of a fresh air hill
You can never stop when the money is counting
Worry till you drop, till you pay your bills

Got a rotten head-ache
Ready for a breakdown
The pressure of the pressure
Is more than I can bare
The awfulness is spreading
It's really done my head in
I think I've been selected
For more than my fair share

Go into the heart of the fresh air valley
Go and have a drink from the mountain stream
Go and have a word before you go doolally
Have a Dicky Bird with your self-esteem

Putting pen to paper
Applying for a loan
Ain't got no collateral
Nor's a cat in hell
The bailiff's on the knocker
I'm going off my rocker
And as regards contentment
I haven't had a smell

Go up to the top of a very high mountain
Go up to the top of a fresh air hill
You can never stop when the money is counting
Working till you drop, till you pay your bills

Go into the heart of the fresh air valley
Go and have a drink from the mountain stream
Go and have a word before you go doolally
Have a Dicky Bird with your self-esteem

Go up to the top of a very high mountain
Go up to the top of a fresh air hill
You can never stop when the money is counting
Worry till you drop, till you pay your bills

Go into the heart of the fresh air valley
Go and have a drink from the mountain stream
Go and have a word before you go doolally
Have a Dick
