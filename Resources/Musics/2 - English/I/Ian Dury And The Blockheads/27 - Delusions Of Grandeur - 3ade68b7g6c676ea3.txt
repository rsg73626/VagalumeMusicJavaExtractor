DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR

Be-ah bickey ba bo-bo-bo 
I got a gal that I love so 

Delusions of grandeur, delusions of grandeur 
Im a dedicated follower of my own success 
I can handle the glamour, I can cope with the stress 
Deal with the doughnuts and please all the rest 
Im polite to the punters and sweet to the press 

I just won a trophy from a radio station 
Im leaving my bat and my balls to the nation 

Ive got megalomania Ive got megalomania 
To be a twinkle in the show-biz dream 
To which effect I could canive and scheme 
I dive into the dairy and I lap up all the cream 
Im up to the armpits in self-esteem 

Stiff me quietly up the charts 
Then I can go public with my private parts 

And here is me, oh look at me 
Just another pathetic pop star 
I love you Greta, what else is there? 
Wont you please accept my hand 

Delusions of grandeur, delusions of grandeur 
Megalomania, megalomania 
Delusions of grandeur, delusions of grandeur 
Megalomania, megalomania 
Delusions of grandeur, delusions of grandeur 
Megalomania, megalomania 
Delusions of grandeur, delusions of grandeur
