YOU'RE THE WHY

I shuffled through the modes of bad behaviour
And hankered for the desolated dawn
I couldn't cope with yet another saviour
To steer me from the way that I was born

Then like a ton of bricks the dawn descended
Recalcitrance was hurtled to the floor
The citadel lay breached and undefended
You brought a love I'd never known before

I want you 'til the seasons lose their mystery
I need you 'til the birds forget to fly
I love you more than anyone in history
Wherever there's a wherefore you're the why

Wherever there's a wherefore ..... you're the whhhhyyy
