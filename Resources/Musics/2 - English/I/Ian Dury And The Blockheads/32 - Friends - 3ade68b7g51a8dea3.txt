FRIENDS

When Freddy Frost was in my soul
And Tommy Tear was in my eye
Phillippa friendship took my hand
Said, "Baby don't cry"

When Tessie Trouble's on patrol
And Suzie Sadness makes you blue
Let Lennie Love come to your door
And pal up with you

Friends are something special
Friends are all we need
Friends with one another
I like you very much indeed

What Peter Panic can't put down
And Nelly Nasty can't destroy
When Harry Happy says, "Hello"
To Jennifer Joy

Friends are more than precious
Friends are guaranteed
Friends with one another
I like you very much indeed

Friends are more than special
Friends are all we need
Friends are so important
I like you very much indeed
