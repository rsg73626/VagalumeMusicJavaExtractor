DON'T ASK ME

Here I stand
With a doughnut for a brain
On my life, I must see you again
I should think that's made it very plain
Is it is
Is it is or is it ain't?

Don't ask me
To leave it out
Or turn it up
Or pack it in
Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask

Don't ask me
I'm an ignorant, I'm afraid
On my life, I believe we're tailor made
I should worry if the weather spoils the trade
I'm a crumb
And I'm in your lemonade

Don't ask me
To knock it off
Or cut it short
Or jack it in
Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask

Let me offer you
My life and all my love
Let me offer you a bargain
What a lovely range
Don't forget the change
Don't ask
Don't ask
Don't ask

Don't ask me to make a sacrifice
On my life, I'm cheap at half the price
Won't you try a portion or a slice?
Slightly warm
But very, very nice

Don't ask me
To leave it out
Or turn it up
Or pack it in
Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask

Don't ask, Don't ask, Don't ask, Don't ask, Don't ask, Don't ask, Don't ask
