UNEASY SUNNY DAY HOTSY TOTSY

Bankrupt the banks
Withhold the rent
Shitters are a wank
And the landlord's bent
It's time that the babies kept quiet
No it ain't

Open up the nicks
Close down the schools
The law is a prick
Not fit to write the rules
It's time that the babies kept quiet
No, they're cool
Time that the babies kept quiet
No it isn't, don't be silly

Uneasy sunny day hotsy totsy
Uneasy hotsy totsy sonny Jim

Question your besotment
With a manky job
Squat on your alloment
For thirty bob
It's time that the babies kept quiet
Shut your gob!

Melt the guns
Dismantle the bombs
Love your neighbour
Wherever they're from
It's time that the babies kept quiet
Up your bum!
Time that the babies kept quiet
No it isn't, don't be silly

Uneasy sunny day hotsy totsy
Uneasy hotsy totsy sonny Jim

London going junkie
Young and full of spunky
Don't care what you tell us
Old and fat and jealous

Uneasy hotsy totsy sunny day

Pills for fun
Damn the news
Different choice
Different things to choose
It's time that the babies kept quiet
Drink your booze!

Time that the babies kept quiet
No it isn't, don't be daft

Uneasy sunny day hotsy totsy
Uneasy hotsy totsy sunny
Uneasy sunny day hotsy totsy
Uneasy hotsy totsy porkie pies!
