NO SUCH THING AS LOVE

There's no such thing as heartache
Tomorrow you'll be gone
There's no such thing as yesterday
The memory lingers on
There's no such thing as thank you
When no one hears your please
There's no such thing as helping out
But kneeling on my knees

There's no such thing as change your mind
Salvation from above
There's no time like the present
There's no such thing as love

There no such thing as lonely
The well's been dry too long
There's no such thing as turn around
Back where you belong

There's no such thing as easing out
When squeeze becomes a shove
There's no change out of sixpence
There's no such things as love

There's no such thing as heartache
Tomorrow you'll be gone
There's no such thing as yesterday
The memory lingers on

There's no such thing as change your mind
Salvation from above
There's no time like the present
There's no such thing as love
