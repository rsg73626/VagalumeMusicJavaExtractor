IT AIN'T COOL

You think it's cool to make me wait with bated breath for what you'll say
You think it's cool to be the overlord of all that you survey
You think it's clever being clever that you wear your fortune well
You think it's cool to be the foxy one, but time alone will tell 

That it ain't cool
(It ain't cool)
It ain't cool
(It ain't cool)

You think it's cool to be the comic, making cracks at my expense
You think it's cool to sit in judgement when I ain't got no defence
You think it's witty being witty when you know my tongue is tied
You think it's cool to be a prankster but your jokes are passing wide

It ain't cool
(It ain't cool)
It ain't cool
(It ain't cool)

It ain't cool to count your blessings one by one (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool to say you've done what you ain't done (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool to claim your winnings when you poop on your beginnings
And another person's innings has begun

You think it's cool to be a sharpy as you cut me down to size
But it ain't cool (it ain't cool)
You think it's cool to brush aside the little people you despise
But it ain't cool (it ain't cool)
You think it's nifty being nifty, and you think you're no-one's fool
But you ain't cool (you ain't cool)
You think it's cool to hold your victim up to cruel ridicule
But it ain't cool (it ain't cool)

It ain't cool to be a cucker
It ain't cool to be a crut
It ain't cool to make your mucker
Wait upon their if, you, but
It ain't cool to think you're pucker
When you're tearing off a sheet
It ain't cool to make a sucker out of everyone you meet
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)

It ain't cool to count your blessings one by one (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool to say you've done what you ain't done (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool to do subtraction, when you're checking every fraction
Now your little piece of action has begun

It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool (it ain't cool)
It ain't cool
