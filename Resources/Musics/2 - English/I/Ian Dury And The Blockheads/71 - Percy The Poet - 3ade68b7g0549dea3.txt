PERCY THE POET

Hello babies
I'm sharper than splinter
I'm meaner than Minter
I'm cooler than winter
And smarter than Pinter

From coast to coast I'm the most verbose and my royal boast is I'm the ace
When I rhyme on time I'm so sublime that your troubles will climb right out of your face
Hypnotise your ears and eyes while your booty flies to outer space
Percy the Poet, I know it 'cos I show it, I'm aglow when I bestow it - on the bass

Stepping to the rhythm
Dressed in baby blue
Mr. Flash & Fancy
Mr. You Know Who
I'm Percy the Poet
I'm Percy the Poet
I'm Percy (yeah) the Poet
Percy

If going to the library was as important as going to the lavatory
Doing art would be just as natural as (thhhhhww)
So speaks the Royal Noble Overlord of Amazing Phrasing
Prince, Duke, Sir, King, Poet Laureate, Count Dracula of Spectacular Vernacular
After you, my dears

Stepping to the rhythm
Dressed in baby blue
Mr. Flash & Fancy
Mr. You Know Who
I'm Percy (yeah) the Poet
I'm Percy the Poet
I'm Percy the Poet
I'm Percy the Poet

Without a doubt I'm the King of Sprout so I jump about 'cos here I come
Tout de suite my beat right up your street I will unseat your very bums
As I speak of my technique for those who seek delirium
Poetry Percy, it's a controversy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy

I'm Percy the Poet
Alright, babies?

He's Percy the Poet, he's Percy the Poet, he's Percy the Poet

He's Percy the Poet, he's Percy the Poet, he's Percy the Poet
