SINK MY BOATS

I've got the feeling but I ain't got the skill
And I don't like your suggestion
Will you still love me when I'm over the hill
Is another stupid question

Don't deny that I show disrespect
Ask me why I don't change the subject
Justify but it has no effect
My reply is that I've been ship-wrecked

You try to be sly but you're so overt
And you know the main objection
It's the passionate pressure that you exert
In the opposite direction

I'm afraid that it seems evident
Though you stay now it's time that you went
Don't persuade me with your blandishment
The old maids had her bad accident

Sink my boats! (Sink my boats)
Once again! (Once again)
Sink my boats! (Sink my boats)
Crash my plane

Justify, but it has no effect
My reply is that I've been shipwrecked

Sink my boats! (Sink my boats)
Once again! (Once again)
Sink my boats! (Sink my boats)
Once again! (Once again)
Sink my boats! (Sink my boats)
Once again! (Once again)
Sink my boats! (Sink my boats)
Crash .....
