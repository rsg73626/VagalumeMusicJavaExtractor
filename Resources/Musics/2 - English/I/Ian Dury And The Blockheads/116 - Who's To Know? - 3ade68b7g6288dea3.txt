WHO'S TO KNOW?

If you smile private things
Who is to know?
If you dance in the rings
Who is to know?
If you run with the mill
And you stay very still
Like you've written your will
Who's to know?


You know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know


If your loves stays inside
Who is to know?
If you lay down and die
Who is to know?
If decisions were made
Looking on from the shade
At the boring parade
Who's to know?


Who the hell needs to know
Who's to know
We can look at ourselves when you go
We can shoulder the blame
Take a note of your name
And you know all the same
Who's to know

 

You know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
