TWENTY TINY FINGERS

She put on the light in the middle of the night
The wet stuff's here let's go
I grabbed a sock, I called the Doc
He told me "Don't be slow"
I got down there with time to spare
And then I sat on pins
Until the doctor shook my hand
And told me "You've got twins"

Twenty tiny fingers
Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces
Each with a turned up nose

One looks like the mummy
With the cutest little curl on top
The other one got a big a bald spot
Exactly like his pop
Pop, pop, 
Pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

Oh, we got the bibs and the bottle and cribs
'Round our dear old flat
No time to see what's on TV
Nowhere to hang my hat
We won't go wrong, we are never done
It's like a steeple chase
Well they came in, and they took over
Like they own the place

Twenty tiny fingers
Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces
Each with a turned up nose

One looks like the mummy
With the cutest little curl on top
The other one got a big a bald spot
Exactly like his pop
Pop, pop, 
Pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

Twice the laundry, twice the bibs
Twice the baby-grows
Double this and double that
Oh, how the money goes

Mum and me we both agree
When all is said and done
We've got twice the headache
And we got double fun

Twenty tiny fingers
Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces
With a turned up nose

One looks like the mummy
With the cutest little curl on top
The other one got a big a bald spot
Exactly like his pop
Pop, pop, 
Pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
