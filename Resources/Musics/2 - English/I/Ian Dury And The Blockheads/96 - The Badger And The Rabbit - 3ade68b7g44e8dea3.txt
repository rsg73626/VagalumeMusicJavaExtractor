THE BADGER AND THE RABBIT

Squirrel gather nuts in May
And he shuts his nuts away
There's a quick brown fox
In the hollyhocks
A vixen in the mood to play

Whoa! the badger don't care
Rabbit got his share
Smile on the face of the fox
The squirrel and the bear
Just stand and stare
The red stag got up on his hocks

The wears and the bear don't bite
His nose in the air tonight
He's beating like a rabbit
Don't wanna feed his habit
His lady rabbit's out of sight

The badger's only here
And he got his share
Smile on the face of the fox
The squirrel and the bear
Just stand and stare
The red stag got up on his hocks

The stag can be sincere at last
A pretty little deer goes past
The badger on the run
Can have a little fun
He doesn't find the pace too fast

Well, the badger don't care
Rabbit got his share
Smile on the face of the fox
The squirrel and the bear
Just stand and stare
The red stag got up on his hocks
