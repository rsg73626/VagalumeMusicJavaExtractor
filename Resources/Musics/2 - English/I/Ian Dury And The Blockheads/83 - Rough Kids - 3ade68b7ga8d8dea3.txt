ROUGH KIDS

Rough kids play rough games and kick tin cans
Leave their feet out in the aisle
Rough kids have bother and make nuisance
They climb on someone else's fence
Rough kids give m-m-m-m-m-mama no obedience
You know, you know, they've got no sense

Enough, (enough), enough, (enough)
So rough, so tough

Rough kids move supreme and disobey
Trouble comes when times are tough
Rough kids move in teams, don't play away
They go round knocking off some stuff
Rough kids let off steam and go astray
Enough, enough to be so rough

Enough to be rough kids
Enough to be rough kids
Enough to be rough kids
Rough kids!
