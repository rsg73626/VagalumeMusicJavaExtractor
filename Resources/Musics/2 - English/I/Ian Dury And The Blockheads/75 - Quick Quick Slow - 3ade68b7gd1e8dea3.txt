QUICK QUICK SLOW

Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow

Give me the quick quick slow
Get there before you go
Climbing upon my toes
Gives me the vertigo
No more fandango
Give me a tango
So much simp√°tico

Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow

The one with the most appeal
Is played with a dirty feel
Similar are difficile
To hang out your balance wheel
Tougher than jangle
Give me the tangle
Rock me back on my heels

Bend your body down low
Give me the quick quick slow

Lay it down far below
Let's get on with the show


Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
Give me the quick quick slow
