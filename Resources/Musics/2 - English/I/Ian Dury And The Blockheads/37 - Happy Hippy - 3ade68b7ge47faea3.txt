HAPPY HIPPY

Im hanging up my hang-ups
Ere I turn into a blank automoton
You wont find me on the treadmill
You can tell em Willy boy has been and gone
Yes mogadon times over
Therell be an empty bed in babylon
Cos im a happy hippy
Its beads and roman sandles from now on

Yes Im a happy hippy, they call me mr whippy
When everything is crappy, being hippy makes you happy
Wes im a happy hippy, and you can bet your bippy
That everybodys happy cos everything is trippy

Ive found a new position
I dont use chairs and tables anymore
I focus my attention from a lovely purple cushion on the floor
When I look back at the rat-race
I dont regret a thing Ive disavowed
With the freedom of an eagle
I can awlays keep my head above the clouds

Cos im a happy hippy they call me mr. whippy
When everything is crappy being hippy makes you happy
Yes im a happy hippy and you can bet your bippy
That everybodys happy cos everything is trippy

Good day everyone

Now I m a jolly beatnik
I havent got a worry in the way
My hair grows long and shaggy
As I savour every minute of the day
Immune from all achievement
Since I threw away my telly and my phone
In my pastroal pajamas
Spending every waking moment getting stoned

Yes im a happy hippy they call me mr. whippy
When everything is crappy being hippy makes you happy
Yes im a happy hippy and you can bet your bippy
That everybodys happy cos everything is trippy

im a happy hippy and everything is trippy
im a happy hippy and everything is trippy
im a happy hippy and everything is trippy
im a happy hippy and everything is trippy, yipee
