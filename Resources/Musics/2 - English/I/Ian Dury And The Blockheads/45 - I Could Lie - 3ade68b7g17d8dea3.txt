I COULD LIE

I could lie before I could talk
Runaway before I could walk
I could cheat before I could play
I was gone before I could stay

I could curse before I could cry
I could sneer before I could sigh
I could want before I could need
I was awful in thought, word and deed

I could hate before I could feel
I could sell before I could steal
I could creep before I could crawl
I was big before I was small

I could curse before I could cry
I could sneer before I could sigh
I could want before I could need
I was awful in thought, word and deed

La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-lala
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-lala

I could lie before I could talk
Runaway before I could walk
I could cheat before I could play
I was gone before I could stay

I could hate before I could feel
I could sell before I could steal
I could creep before I could crawl
I was big before I was small

I could hurt before I could cry
I could sneer before I could sigh
I could want before I could need
I was awful in thought, word and deed

La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-lala
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-lala
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-lala
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-lala

laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
