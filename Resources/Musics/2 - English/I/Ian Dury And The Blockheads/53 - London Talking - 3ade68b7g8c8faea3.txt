LONDON TALKING

I went and changed a pound for the Underground
The Bakerloo northbound cos I fancied coming round
The Bakerloo northbound cos you fancied coming round?
Hmm, the Bakerloo northbound cos I fancied coming round

Well, I'm very glad you did, and I'm glad you paid a quid
I'd go and put the kettle on if I could find the lid
You'd go and put the kettle on if you could find the lid?
Yes, I'd go and put the kettle on if I could find the lid

Please allow me to agree cos I'd love a cup of tea
And I'd risk it for a biscuit, as I said, well, you know me
You'd risk it for a biscuit?
Yes, I'd risk it for a biscuit, as I said, you know me

No sooner said than done, aren't you the lucky one?
We're out of chocolate hollies, would you like a Chelsea bun?
Oh, you're out of chocolate hollies, ooh, I'd love a Chelsea bun
Since we're out of chocolate hollies you must have a Chelsea bun

That's a very tasty hat, where d' you have to go for that?
It's the first one that I've seen that doesn't make your face look fat
Ooh, it's the first one that you've seen that doesn't make my face look fat?
Yes, it's the first one that I've seen that doesn't make your face look fat

I got it down the Lane where the prices are insane
I could have got the houndstooth but I rather liked the plain
Ooh, you could have got the houndstooth but you rather liked the plain?
Yes, I could have got the houndstooth but I rather liked the plain

Ooh, it doesn't half look sweet, it's more than half a proper treat
It's a monkey to a pony that there's more than half a sheep
Ooh, it's a monkey to a pony that there's more than half a sheep?
Yes, it's a monkey to a pon
