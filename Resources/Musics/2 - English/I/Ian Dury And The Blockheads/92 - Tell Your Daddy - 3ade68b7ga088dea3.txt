TELL YOUR DADDY

Your daddy took one look at me and said
"There goes Mr Evil with a bad hat on his head
He must be delinquent he wears such wicked clothes
Those shabby suits and big brown boots, there's danger in his pose
How can you love a man in gloves - a jailbird and a hound?
A scallywag, a reprobate - the devil I'll be bound"

I know your daddy
Says I'm a baddy
'Cos I won't do what I'm told
But Jenny Dancer
You know the answer
I've shown you a heart of gold

Your daddy never listens to a word
"I can see he's bad now, daughter, don't be so absurd
He's got no finer feelings, he's the singer in a band
He's cold and hard with no regard - why can't you understand?
I know his type - a guttersnipe, he dresses like a thief
Devote yourself to him, my girl, things will come to grief"

I know your daddy
Says I'm a baddy
'Cos I'm wild and fancy free
But Jenny Dancer
You know the answer
You have seen the good in me

So tell your daddy
I'm not a baddy
Tell him just to wait and see
And Jenny Dancer
My sweet romancer
You can run away with me
Yes, you can run away with me
You can run away with me
You can run away with me
You can run away with me

(Run away, run away, run away)
