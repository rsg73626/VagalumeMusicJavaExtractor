VERY PERSONAL

You could say I like it here
With my mouth right in your ear
What a lovely atmosphere
It's very personal

You might say it's where it's at
On the sofa in your flat
A little bit of this and a little bit of that
It's very personal

Done up like a kipper
Tonced up like a toff
Here's your golden slipper
Close your eyes and cough
Very personal
Very personal

You could say I like it
With my mouth right in your earhole
What a lovely atmosphere
It's very personal
Very personal
