I MADE MARY

I made mary cry
in a lonley bus shelter
I put in my laundry tongs
in the back of her leg

severed a hamstring
in the lonley bus shelter
I payed no attention
but I made mary beg

im walking the floor
in a white dormatory, called barley lane hospital
im dreaming my dreams
in a cold iron bed shhh

fourteen my days
in a white hospital dormetory
I shall catch up with mary
ill fuck all your tears away

hahahahahhahahahhahahahaha

I sleep for tonight
in a lonleyl bus shelter
and with me for comfort
I shall my cuddle tongs
when mary passes through
my lonley bus shelter
I shall stick em right up her jacksie
I shall put ??? to her ???
