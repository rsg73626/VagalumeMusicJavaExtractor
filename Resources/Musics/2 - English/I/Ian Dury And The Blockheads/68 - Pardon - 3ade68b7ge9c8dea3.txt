PARDON

New digs and prospects of a job 
New digs and prospects ............

Have I been half interested 'till now? 


Breath and armpits feet 
For Christ's sake please stay sweet 
An ever present threat of hands that want to sweat 
My head aches and I'm bursting for a piss 
Why should I subject myself to this? 

Pardon, sort of, oh 
Pardon, you know, oh 
Pardon, um, oh 
Pardon, er, oh

My dreams could come true if I make the right impression


Hope it looks OK 
I had it done today 
Was that me who laughed? 
Oh God I feel so daft 
Think I've got a new one on my nose 
Don't I look a lemon in these clothes? 

Pardon, sort of, oh 
Pardon, you know, oh 
Pardon, um, oh 
Pardon, er, oh 

Do these smells belong to me?


Must not laugh or crawl 
Dear dandruff do not fall 
My stomach heaving chap
Make me a proper prat 
My head aches and I need to be excused 
Tell the truth you don't seem too amused 

Pardon, sort of, oh 
Pardon, you know, oh 
Pardon, um, oh 
Pardon, er, oh 
Pardon, sort of, oh 
Pardon, you know, oh 
Pardon, um, oh 
Pardon, er, oh 
Pardon, sort of, oh 
Pardon, you know, oh 
Pardon, um, oh 
Pardon, er, oh
