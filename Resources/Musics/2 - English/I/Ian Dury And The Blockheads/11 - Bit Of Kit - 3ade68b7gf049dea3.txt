BIT OF KIT

I want a three piece suit in black worsted
With a three button jacket and a notch lapel
With a boxy back, French shoulder
And a zig-zag raised seam that you do so well
Eighteen inch bottom trouser with a two inch cuff
No taper, no flare, just parallel

Nine hole air-wears, fisherman's warms
Red long-johns, chill-proof vest of the snuggest fit
Second-hand Turnbull and Asser sea-island cotton shirt
With no collar attached to it
Black Burberry trenchcoat, white silk scarf
No groins or kettle, that should complete my kit

And then I want to live in a conversation area
