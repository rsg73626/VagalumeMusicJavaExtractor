MISCHIEF

Popeye Pearce is pimple, Laurence Smith is hard
Ricky loves a kicking and he wants to join the guards
Barry breaks the windows of his broken home
Have a guess. His tiny mind's been scarred

Lionel touches women when they're walking through the park
He goes in people's gardens nicking laundry in the dark
Roger left a sleeper across the District Line
His dad's a shipping clerk

Boys let's have a laugh
Let's have some mischief


Fill a Durex full of water
And throw it on a bus - that would be mischief
Take a pigeon to the pictures
Let's cause a bit of fuss - a bit of mischief
Let's go bloody raving mad
Let's do something really bad
They won't forget the day you had
Some mischief

Jack and Stan are tossing pals like monkeys in the zoo
When they got caught by Gonad Gibbs they had to wank him too
Incentive didn't want two of Dave - Get it?
He failed his interview (failed his interview) - Oh yeah?

She's got crinkly hair
Underneath her underwear
I know because I've been there

(Anticipation, anticipate)

Wow!
Wow!

Don't let's hang about
Let's have some mischief

Here, pour locking fluid on a Bentley, then let down his tyres
Hahahahaha
Let's go and kill some kiosks, start a few more fires
Could this be mischief?

Let's go completely over the top
Let's do the bop that just won't stop
Let's go and have another drop
Of mischief

I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it,

I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it, I'm sorry I done it,

I'm sorry I done it!, I'm sorry I done it!, I'm sorry I done it!, I'm sorry I done it!, I'm sorry I done it!
