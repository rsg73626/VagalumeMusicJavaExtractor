TAKE YOUR ELBOW OUT OF THE SOUP, YOUR SITTING ON THE CHICKEN

To be simple and wise 
Never tell lies 
Always pick on someone my own size 
Could be quite a thing 
If I make it swing 
I'll write you a letter or I'll give you a ring 

Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the chicken 
Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the chicken 
Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the chicken 
Holding you tight is extremely all right 
If ain't called love then it ain't worth a light, sailor 

To be sweet and true 
To the likes of you 
A promise that time will not undo 
Would be truly smart 
And when I make a start 
I'll come and pick you up in the horse and cart 

The mouse runs up your leg, it's one o'clock in China 
The mouse runs up your leg, ooh, it's one o'clock in China 
The mouse runs up your leg, oh, it's one o'clock in China 
Oh for the wings of a dove, goodness me, I'm in love 

Arms of love are open always, all around you closing theirs 
You're a darling and I love you 
Signed politely, one who cares

Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the kittens
Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the kittens
Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the kittens
Take your elbow out of the soup, you're sitting on the kittens

To be simple and wise
