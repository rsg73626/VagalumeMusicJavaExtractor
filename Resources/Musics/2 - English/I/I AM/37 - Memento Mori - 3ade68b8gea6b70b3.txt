MEMENTO MORI

I'm a slave, a servant, a symbol
What can I do
Where did I go wrong
I sit back and look at my life, what have I done

My body decays as my life withers away
I'm off the edge, I don't know where I'm going
The only way out, remember death
Memento mori

I'm Falling off the edge, becoming what I hate
Careless, faithless, selfish
I can't even think for myself I want to feel like I did
but I'm far too gone. I'm too far gone

Careless, hopeless, selfish
I'm Falling off the edge, becoming what I hate
Careless, faithless, selfish
I'm off the edge, I don't know where I'm going
The only way out, remember death
Careless, faithless, selfish
