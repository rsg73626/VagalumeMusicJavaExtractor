WAKE UP CALL

You've lost everything
Just read between the lines
That you have written
I never thought that you
Would ever bite at the only hands that fed you

If there's one thing that you have learned from me
It's that you'll never survive begging on your knees
I will never give you
My helping hand again

You broke everything that I thought was real
I was so afraid to let you sink
But the only thing you ever did
Was pull me under
That was the final straw
The straw that broke us all
So lay in the very bed you've made for yourself

Heed my words
And listen close
If you don't change your life
You'll be a ghost
Fear of rejection and shoving aside
All that is real
Now it's time to show you how it feels
Ungrateful
So ungrateful

Make good of what you have
The price it pays is always true
Always true
It's not too late to follow through
If and when you should succeed
I'll take your hand and let the past recede
