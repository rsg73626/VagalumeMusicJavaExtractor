BRAIN DAMAGE

Blind they pull us to the cliffs
Watch yourself they're just sent to kill.
Are we afraid of falling short
It's misdirection I've seen.

We are the sons and daughters of broken homes
Kings of great peace couldn't compare to us
Because we are the light wherever darkness breeds
And we will never bow to them.

Torn they trick the best of us
A preacher smile behind a pulpit of blame.
Are you a slave to brain damage
Let's fight the motions and feed.

We are the sons and daughters of broken homes
Kings of great peace couldn't compare to us
Because we are the light wherever darkness breeds
And we will never bow to them.

We are the sons and daughters of broken homes
Kings of great peace couldn't compare to us
Because we are the light wherever darkness breeds
And we will never bow to them.
