THE ELEVATOR

Weathered by the New York sun
The elevator,
Twenty-seven seconds later
She finds herself in the middle of his room
The taxicab is right outside

This is our time 
Without a doubt I know this is our time
This is our time to stand alone
It is time to say goodbye

Severed From her only love 
Out the window
His heart canâ€™t stay at bay
She finds herself in the back seat of a lie
Drive on Drive far away

Get up and go!
