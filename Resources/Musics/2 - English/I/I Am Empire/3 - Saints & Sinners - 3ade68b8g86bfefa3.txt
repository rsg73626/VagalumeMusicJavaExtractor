SAINTS & SINNERS

Can we turn the clock to yesterday
When I thought I was enough,enough,enough
And I'm thinking about the things you said under your breath
Were too well heard
What you want and what you need is vain
You know your running in reverse,reverse,reverse
A time machine that has gone insane
Well your someone or something I don't need

How can you be a saint when your a sinner like me
How can you be anything at all
How can you be a god when your a coward to me
How can you be anything at all

You sound just like a prophet man
Except you have no eyes to see
Falling short of all your dreams
Im sorry
No, you'll never be the same as me
Im not running in reverse,reverse,reverse
Go ahead and build a church
Convert back
If you can say sorry well I'm sorry

How can you be a saint when your a sinner like me
How can you be anything at all
How can you be a god when your a coward to me
How can you be anything at all

You don't make any sense
Full of incompetence
You are so meaningless
You will die without a name
A saint when you're a sinner, a saint when you're a sinner
A god when you're a coward, a god when you're a coward
A saint when you're a sinner, a saint when you're a sinner
A god when you're a coward, a god when you're a coward

How can you be a saint when your a sinner like me
How can you be anything at all
How can you be a god when your a coward to me
How can you be anything at all
