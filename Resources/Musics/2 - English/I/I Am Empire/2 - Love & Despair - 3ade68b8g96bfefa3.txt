LOVE & DESPAIR

Look in my eyes
They are like the ocean blue and confused
I'm a mess
Heard the wind was just a whisper of greatness to know and to be
Look in my brain a storm without an ending
Searching for help I give up
A whirlwind of madness,
Yet a slight relief of gladness I sing

Lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium

Oh oh oh oh

Can you hear him coming?
He stands in white we all fall to the wind
Can you hear him coming?
He stands in white we all fall to the wind

Lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium
Lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium

Don't you let me go
Won't you let me know how long I'll bleed
And a thought to harvest all my pain
Call me insane

I'd rather feel lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium

Lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium
Lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium
Lost between this love and despair
Help me find the medium
