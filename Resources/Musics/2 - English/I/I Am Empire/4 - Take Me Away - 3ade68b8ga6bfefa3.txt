TAKE ME AWAY

Trophies on my bedroom mantle never meant much to me.
It was all to make you happy or something of the sort.
Think I'll build a boat sail somewhere I can be myself.
But who is that?
Who is that?

Son it's not your fault.
You are who you are.
I will lead you to where they wont make you small
Take me away where the monsters will play.
Take me away where they'll never see my face.
Take me away where the monsters will play.
Take me away where they'll never see my face.
Oh...

The ocean lead me somewhereâ€¦
The trees look like walls
I can hear the shouts and calls of creatures in the dark.
So scared freak out, lay low to the ground
Looking for a clearing I hear a voice from afar.

Son it's not your fault.
You are who you are.
I will lead you to where they wont make you small

Take me away where the monsters will play.
Take me away where they'll never see my face.
Take me away where the monsters will play.
Take me away where they'll never see my face.

Every dream has an end
A plot with a twist
It's time to surrender
Call it part of the plan
It's out of my hands
Swore I'd never be home sick but I am

Son it's not your fault.
You are who you are.
And I will lead you to where they wont make you small

Take me away where the monsters will play.
Take me away where they'll never see my face.
Take me away where the monsters will play.
Take me away where they'll never see my face.
They'll never see my face.
