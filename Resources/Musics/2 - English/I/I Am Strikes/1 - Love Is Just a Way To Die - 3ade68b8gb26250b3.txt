LOVE IS JUST A WAY TO DIE

I took on all your pain
Oh, what a great mistake I made
I never thought you'd leave me
With all your burdens overneath me

'I miss you' would be understated
Memories have slowly faded
That love you sacrificed
Was just another way to die

If heaven is a place you'll go
I don't know if I will ever see you
And if you leave before you know
I'll let go of all we've ever been through
I'm finding out the ways to live
In spite of all the wars
You left inside my mind
Love is just a way to die

We both have scars to show off
All the nights we carved alone
If you'd come back, believe me
I'd show you pain is not self-healing

Do you think of me at breakfast?
When your hungry nights are sexless?
One day you'll come to find
I found another way to die

If heaven is a place you'll go
I don't know if I will ever see you
And if you leave before you know
I'll let go of all we've ever been through
I'm finding out the ways to live
In spite of all the wars
You left inside my mind
Love is just a way to die

Make me forget my name
And get drunk on your words and laugh
Save me regret and blame
And let love rectify the past

I'll settle for a life that's a little more gentle
If you'd come back, we could last

If heaven is a place you'll go
I don't know if I will ever see you
And if you leave before you know
I'll let go of all we've ever been through
I'm finding out the ways to live
In spite of all the wars
You left inside my mind
Love is just a way to die
