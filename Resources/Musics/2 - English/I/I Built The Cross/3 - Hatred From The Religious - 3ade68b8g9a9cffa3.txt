HATRED FROM THE RELIGIOUS

Guided by hatred, you've created a religion all of your own.
Dogmatically defending your hypocritical position (position).
Grounded in rebellion, yet ever conforming
To the demands of your peers.
What is it you're so afraid of? brain washed.

Emptied of all individuality.
Demanding that we fit your mold.
We don't fear you - you've made us stronger.
Open-mindedness redefined.
Keep telling us we're ignorant, keep telling us

We don't belong, we'll keep you in
Our prayers and keep making worship songs (2x).
Where is this tolerance you speak of?
Why are your lips tainted by that which you condemn?
A strictly defined double standard

I am disgusted by what I observe
(disgusted by what I observe).
I am so tired of a finger pointed at me
With closed eyes and a loud mouth, are you unwilling to learn?
I am disgusted by what I observe.
