STAND TOGETHER

With a fist adorned in brass, 
it's time to stand up and fight your fears.
Never back down, never give up.
This isn't about looking tough, it's about lifting each other up.
This is our home, we roll together till the day we die, 
without my brothers, this wouldn't be life.
Our hearts are gold and our motives are pure, 
so keep your judgment off me.
No matter who you are, no matter what you've done, 

It's never too late to change, your always welcome with us.
Scream out at the top of your lungs, fight for what is yours, 
It takes more than blood to be family, 
There's no stopping us now, this is our time to shine.
