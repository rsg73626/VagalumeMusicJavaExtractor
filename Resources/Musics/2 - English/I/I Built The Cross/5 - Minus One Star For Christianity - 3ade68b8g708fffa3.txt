MINUS ONE STAR FOR CHRISTIANITY

Your hostility doesn't scare us, 
and we will never return your hatred.
Myopic understanding of our mission.
Burnishing misconceptions and chimerical inventions 
created in the depths of your own mind - no foundation in reality. 
Obfuscate our faith - lost in fanciful tradition
Our hearts go out to you.
We will never fit your rubric, and we don't feel a need to try.
Our intention is not to offend, oppress, or force 
anything on anyone - but to carry out this mission and share 
Christ with everyone.
Please understand that we do this out of love 
and please understand that we'll never give up.
This is where we belong - we will stand strong.
