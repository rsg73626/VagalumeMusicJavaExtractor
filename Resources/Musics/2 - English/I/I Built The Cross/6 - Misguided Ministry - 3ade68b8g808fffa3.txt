MISGUIDED MINISTRY

A spiritual giant for the crowd - 
who are you when shrouded in secrecy?
Spewing hateful words about the God you never knew - 
you spit in his face.
Do you not realize what you've done?
A sugar-coated message wrapped in ambiguity.
Desacralized, a watered-down gospel.
Decontextualization runs rampant.
Unmitigated autonomy is the only goal.
A life for Jesus, but only for a paycheck - 
only for the worship of others.
The politics have consumed your mind.
Tradition rules over doctrine.
Do you not realize what you've done?
How many must turn away before you open your eyes?
How many before you turn and follow?
They are the lamb, you are the slaughter.
Worn leather straps hold the millstone to your neck.
At the bottom of an ocean, you've served your purpose.
A heart emptied of love and compassion - 
a thick wallet in your pocket.
Where does your treasure truly lie?
Money is your God. Deception funded bank account.
Power is your goal, religion is your driving force. 
Manipulating the masses.
Are you proud of what you've created?
Power is your goal.
We are the generation that must change this.
The lukewarm church, breathe into them life.
Return God to these Halls. Return worship to the sanctuary. 
Renew the fire that used to burn.
Replenish your heart in love Show the world the real Christ.
Return worship to the sanctuary.
Renew the fire that used to burn.
Replenish your heart in love.
Show the world the real Christ.
Are you ready to show your true colors?
Today is the day to give worship.
Take it to the foot of the cross, 
put your heart in the hands of our Lord, today is the day.
Take it to the cross. Give your heart to the Lord.
Take back our generation. Today is the day to give worship. 
Take it to the foot of the cross. Take back our generation.
