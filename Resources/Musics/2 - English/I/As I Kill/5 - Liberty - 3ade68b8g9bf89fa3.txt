LIBERTY

Meet in a vertival horizon
I'm on the floor
you know that I am
passed out, there's no use crying
So just let me go
Just let me go

No; no tears will fall when you're gone
I don't feel, it's what I've become
The pain in my blood is more than enough
to forget what we had and what we have become
Fuck you, fuck me
To hell if we bleed

And all I have left is to die
I don't care; don't even wonder why
things are so fucked up in my life
I can't see why I still survive
Nothing seems to be killing me
There's nothing, no desease
And yet I feel nothing but hatred

To think you had me at hello
I wish I could have known
After all these memories
you fuck me over now I'm never sober
I'm letting go of this pain;
this suffering in vain

And all I have left is to die
I don't care; don't even wonder why
things are so fucked up in my life
I can't see why I still survive
Nothing seems to be killing me
There's nothing, no desease
And yet I feel nothing but hatred

Every exhale is a sigh
This pain will die

Meet in a vertival horizon
I'm on the floor
you know that I am
passed out, there's no use crying
So just let me go
Just let me go
Nothing seems to be killing me
There's nothing, no desease
And yet I feel nothing but hatred
