WASTELAND

war turning youg hearts into stone
the world has gone cold, nothing to hold
senses failed, becoming too old
ive been told that there is no where left to go

the world is turning against its self
everyones a terrorist in this fucking hell
with the blood you spilt through our hands

some one take me out of this wasteland
freedom is just another myth made by man
some one take me out of this wasteland

so who the fucks to blame
whats the diference between right and wrong
do you realy think people on the top care
why do they kill innocent people
how the fuck could you defy innocence
people on the top dont care any more they dont give a fuck

we dont give a fuck

some one take me out of this wasteland
freedom is just another myth made by man
some one take me out of this wasteland

some one take me out of this wasteland
freedom is just another myth made by man
some one take me out of this wasteland
