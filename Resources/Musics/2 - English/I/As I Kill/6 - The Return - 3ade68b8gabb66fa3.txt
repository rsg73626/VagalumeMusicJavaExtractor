THE RETURN

Welcome back to those who will never return
I see them at war fighting for a lost cause
Welcome back, you know they'll never return
When they die, that's when they will see the end

Human distruction, I've become so aware of mortal suicide
And we die everytime; everytime we kill, we die

The return of those who never left
Makes as much sense as fighting for peace
The return of those who never left
Makes as much sense as fucking for virginity
