A MILLION LIES

Cruel intentions, cold demensions 
Redefining definitions 
Reallowing penetrations 
Simulating novacation 

Die, I look into the heart of a demon's eye going back in time, time and I can't deny what's on her mind, what's on her mind

Just leave me, deceive me, take out my heart and please me, will never return here, won't die and I won't burn here 

Souls invating, incarnating 
Death awaits, it's still awaiting 
Ask for answers, they're evading 
Lovely world of bitter hating

And if I told a million lies would you still believe me?
