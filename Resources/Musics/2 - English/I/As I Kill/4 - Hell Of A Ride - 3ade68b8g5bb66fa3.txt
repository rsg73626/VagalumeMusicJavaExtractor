HELL OF A RIDE

All these memories are dying
Can't hold on to you any more my darling

I'm praying this isnt for ever
Never thought that seeing your smile
Would bring such agony
I just want us to be together

Didn't say good-bye because I
Thought I'd be back so soon
Blood fills my lungs when these sharp words fill my tounge

All the lies you never told me
All the fights we'll never have
Less reasons to make up
What we never had

Didn't say good-bye because I
Thought I'd be back so soon
Blood fills my lungs when these sharp words fill my tounge

Vengeance, violence, blood dance, can't stand
Your hand, my hand, no chance, last glance

Didn't say good-bye because I
Thought I'd be back so soon
Blood fills my lungs when these sharp words fill my tounge
