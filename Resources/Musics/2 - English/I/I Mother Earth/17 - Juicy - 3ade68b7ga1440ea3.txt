JUICY

Hey alright 
That killer's overpaid 
I never liked avenging angels 
How good are they? 
That killer's got it made 

Who's got the stones? 
Who's gonna be the goat? 
Who's gonna find the love in danger 
Then let it go? 

I know you can't crawl 
I know you'll rise above it all 
You'll find a way to get out from under 
Cuz you're a cannibal 
You found that wall 
And hit it like a wrecking ball 
I feel the pain, I feel like a hunter 
And you're the animal 

Ram on, be gone, stay low 
Be good, be great 

Love 
Gimme all your love 
I'm juicy like a cold wind
