NO CONA

In time I'll find why everyone out there 
In the painted sun 
Has already found their root...they've found home 
And I'm tired of beating every drum 
For old friends that never come 
Went looking for them once...and found none 

I'm so unwound 
And I know in my own way 
I'm breaking down without screaming out loud 
I'm facing up and reaching out 
In the end I'll come around so shut your mouth 
Cuz I can't stand or yell out... 
Tell everyone I'm numb 

Here lies the former undisturbed 
A bit high and a candle burns 
It's goin all south...it's all gone 
A red face that hides in nervous hands 
Once a better friend than an enemy 
Will I make another run...or am I done 

Someday I'll line up everyone out there 
In a late day sun 
For one deep and final breath...
