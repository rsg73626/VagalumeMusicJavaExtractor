GOD ROCKET (INTO THE HEART OF LAS VEGAS)

Undertow, you're thrown 
An old God has one bolt left 
In flight 
An aeroplane in slow motion 
While all around are dark days 
With all around unsure 
I'll hole up in the right place and wait 
Until the tide has turned...with anger...i'm dead weight...i'm anchored 

The white dove has done 
The one world has come down hard 
So why not 
Share the pain of our ptoblems 
When all around are wrong ways 
When all around is hurt 
I'll roll up in an odd shape and wait 
Until the tide has turned...with anger...i'm dead weight...i'm anchored 

Can somebody give me the 'all safe' 
Can somebody tell me 
I'm so well loved in the glow and stain 
In the slow parade, will somebody tell me 
I'm so well loved 

...And the light that shines 
Our road has overstated nothing while all the wine and hope 
Are like a hill that you will climb slow for something you could 
Not ever have 
And when you said 'now the dream is dead, our autimns will never rise again' 
You were right again and it hurts 
Wild awesome friends 
They face a plain red sober wind and know the pain 
For what it is 
They're always the ones who slow the drift 
Who live for all that's more than this 
Who love for all that burns 
To choose their words...with anger...and dead weight...they're anchored 

Went looking for something good with August 
In the rain and all I've ever saved 
I'm stuck at the fork that hids 
My road 
Why does the ground take hold once every mile from home?
