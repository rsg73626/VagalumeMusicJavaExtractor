SOFT BOMB SALAD

Inside of a moment shines the wet unbelievable 
Beside every problem there's a rat under siege 
And broken with all the right drugs 
In time, in depth, in present tense 
I'm cold and awful, yes I know 
Uptight, intent on making sense 
We are who we are 

Instead of a motion there's a rest unachievable 
Because in a cold wind there's a laugh underneath 
Unspoken in all the right tongues 

In time, in depth, in present tense 
I'm cold and awful, yes I know 
Uptight intent on making sense 
We are who we are 
In mind and breath, in my own head 
I'm so unpopular, I know 
In life and death, and second chance 
We are who we are 

And half along 
Were slaughtered in song 
When left alone 
We were unsafe 
When all is done 
To be honestly numb 
is all I can be lying here 
Awake 

A mild psychosis holds my hand underneath it all 
A kind of ferocious old regret on its knees
