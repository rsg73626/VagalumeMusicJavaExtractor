THE UNIVERSE IN YOU

It's just a thing with you
A spacious place
Infininte
Dangerous
Promising
Black with white
This night

Years of tears, emotion
Held like so... inside
Autumn
Dogs
Saturday
Nervousness
Blood
Drugs
Rage

And then it hit me
Though I saw it coming
Hard
Sheer intensity
The thinking in your thinking
The feeling in your feeling
Touched by a boy's
Restless young erection
You slam

Arms are open
Eyes are wide
What was out there
Is now in you
You drink it in
Scratched the skin
Bit the hand that hits
You had your way

Wanting some of everything
Living life
Thinking it would shine
Touched this stone
And what'd you find?
Humanity blind

A fiery red
And glowing world
Intoxicating... to a girl
Straddling life
In the atmosphere
But it's just changing times
