SUMMERTIME IN THE VOID

i felt the break and roll of the nexus on a day when the whole world
elected to sell us out there are the hands that grab my attention
when all is what i'm giving they slow me down slower
then southern muddy rivers
when you think theres salvation when you don't want
to leave your room eyes with eyes open undreaming
when it's summertime in the void
when it's summertime in the void the sun is upside down
and facing the other way until days end with a skitzophrenic everjoy
and a sense of doubt you wait automatic and afraid
on ran the train through my solar plexis on the day i made good connection
with love out loud, home, hate and sound
and who wrote the words to my death sentence when life is what i'm living
and leaving now while i trip till time is over
when it's summertime in the void and the stars yell out your name all together
and insane 'cause they're broken words they are a noise there's
no answer for you wait automatic and afraid.
