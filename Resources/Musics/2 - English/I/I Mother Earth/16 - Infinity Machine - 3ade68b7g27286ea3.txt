INFINITY MACHINE

a sudden stop and then i woke up
with vertigo in the wrong place
everybody back home laughing there
goes one more throw away
always alone
i imagen when they turned it on they said
farewell when i said id 
volunteer i thought it might be a
good thing
to enlighten in a time bend
away from warm bed homeless hoping 
and up i imagine
when they turned 
it on the forgot to wan me theres
no comedown when your on 
your own looking for changed while the fate 
swing loses control while your head spins you cant see it coming while
you fall into your calling one man alone infinity machine
hold my head hold my hand hold my
breath and now
always running from the sun always a need
for recovery never happy in a stand still 
never listened to bullshit broken or whole
