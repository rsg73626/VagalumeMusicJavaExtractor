LEVITATE

Feel Heavy 
Once Felt it... Hard 

Question an answer 
For a thousand days 
Give birth to the Earth 
Then let it drift away 
Open and flow 
Just swinging forever 
Making love to the ground 
Because it just feels better 

It ain't easy 
Drink it in 
Think a while... Spit 

There's both shining and darkness 
Yet they share a day 
Was there a man on a cross 
Or was it just a fake 
Even in shame 
You can't hide your growth 
Though the butterfly flies 
He's sinking like a stone 
The killing sun 
It hurts my eyes 
And comes hard 
Onto my skin 
And as I find shade 
From tree to tree 
I live to learn 
To dig down deep 
I feel the pain 
And love the hurt 
I don't complain 

Trancing in the grass 
Suck it off the world 
When you're full of itv Shrug, feel fortunate 
Then go where levitation lives 
Where agrivation grows 
Where sleeping's too hard 
On the thinking bone 
Intensity is what I need 
To suffer for the pleasure 
Its heat, hard, life and death 
Living all together 
In a small room 
Full of me and my friends 
Trying to find the means 
To justify the end
