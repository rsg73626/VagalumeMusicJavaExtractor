GOOD FOR SULE

The fathers torment the one son it falls on across warm deep oceans
of moments and the man he must become
A whole world away eighteen brothers holding out while the tree
of importance waits but close and safe wife and daughters hear no drums
or the voices of those he'll change
and if it feels good they must understand that the way had opened
to just a man with a faith in all good people walking gently knowing
just how wonderful it is
of the family portrait and a path unchosen both the roaring lions
of emotion he knew one day would have to come
while a whole world away his old home is reaching out
with the hands of enraptured hope but more than that they hold up
