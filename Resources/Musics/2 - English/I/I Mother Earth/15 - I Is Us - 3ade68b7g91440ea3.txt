I IS US

Even in the wreck house of a promise 
Even in the gem blow of an awe fist 
Everyone's an air flow through the blonde dirt 
Everyone's an asshole in the wonder 
When every commotion controls my wants 
I lay down long and know other hurts 

If it's not a problem 
I want you to work me good 
I want you in motion 
I want you to go down full 
I want you to yell 
With your hair in my finger 
You know you make me so 

Misogynous 
When I is us 

Every time the bread breaks there's a hunger 
Every second heart aches with a thunder 
Heaven in the jet stream of a bong drain 
Heaven in the meat dream of an all-way 
When every emotion takes hold and haunts 
I lay down hard and know other worlds 

If it's not a problem 
I want you to work me good 
I want you in motion 
I want you to go down full 
I want you to yell 
With your hair in my finger 
You know you make me so 

Misogynous 
When I is us 

You make me so 
And now we know the sound 
Of blue eyes rolled over, the smell of fine young hope 
The feel and taste of always 
So I can't yet shout and I can't roll over 
And I'm breaking a sweat 
It's time to wake up 
Thank you, you've made me so...
