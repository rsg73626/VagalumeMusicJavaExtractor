AND THE EXPERIENCE

Snowin' in July
My girls mouth on my toes
Complainin' old ghosts
In bedsheets of love
Christmas
In my legs
A strange start to summer
But I gave it all up
In time to wonder

Just when I thought
I knew what I wanted
A dirty old man reminds me
I'm young...
"Experience
The truth of all colours
Think it out,
Feel it up
But do it right now"

How long 'till I'm real
I long to be real
How long 'till I'm real
Left home to live
And I did

Trippin' all alone

I've travelled miles
Because of my head
I've sang to myself
To keep from going mad
The land as my bed
I slept beside the road
The ground is my friend
I become the road
The longer I'm gone
Changing on the go
The better I'll know

Mother and Dad
Can only give you so much
So I gave it of myself
In the real world, love
Twenty first century
Mind expansion
I wrote my own poems
