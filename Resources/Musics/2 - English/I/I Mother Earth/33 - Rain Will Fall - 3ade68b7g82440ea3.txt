RAIN WILL FALL

Lookin'
At the world go
Trying to understand
Electric wind blowin' like
A demon fan
Or a symphony of hatred
Blowin angst
Off an immaculate stage
How tranquil is an ocean
Before a storm
Like a silent play

Chanting thunder
Dance naked and I feel
So wired
It's a personal voodoo
Runnin' through my veins
Like blood
With inhibition long gone
and no real sense
of space or time
A weird vibration
Don't know my right
From wrong

Rain will fall

Poetry in motion
Both rolling
Both getting me high
A shiver went through me
A tidal wave
I only felt inside
It's an animal instinct
That takes us over
And we must survive

Four brothers make the mother
