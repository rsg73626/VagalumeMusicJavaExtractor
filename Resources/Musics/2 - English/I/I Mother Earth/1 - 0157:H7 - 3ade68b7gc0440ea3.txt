I dreamt the red whale song 
Hold the moment strong 
Then the moment's gone 
I never can get enough 
Again without the words 
Again without the someone who will 
Afford me some 

This is me hangin' on 

I once read a mind 'til dawn 
Let the poem hum on emotion's 
rolled tongue 
I've never had enough 
Are we okay? Are we open? 
Again without the someone 

So this is me hangin' on 
I'm hangin on 
And this is my world 

Now I'm spending every night 
Being fed through a grinder 
The price for falling down 
I'm never through paying 
I might be meat for minds 
I may be numbered...hung 
I might succumb 

This is my world
