UNDONE

Living alone, body shaking
Cars outside
They're singing their songs
The candles wave
And I get to thinking
How people see things
And deal with them
In different ways

Trying to move forward
Like a walk underwater
Two steps back
Like a walk through silent streets
I've heard the word
Guess I'm tired of trying
Everybody
I'm saying the 'pop' is gone

Fighting the fight
With the waterline
Catching breath
And a dirty breeze
What's been used up
Has been more than needed
One river rolling
Two rivers going dry

I'm down
Undone
Down, undone then gone
Being, beyond
Soft hands
