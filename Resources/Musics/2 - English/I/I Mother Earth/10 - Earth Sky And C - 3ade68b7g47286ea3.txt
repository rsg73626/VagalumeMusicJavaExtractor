EARTH SKY AND C

Given good ground to walk around on/ 
It would mean so much to me to see/ 
Things for my still young self or else/ 
I might not believe 
whatever people/ Say in their own ways, colourful faces/ 
And easy going shame almost telling me/
 Things I need to know/ We're 
travelling, looking for the world/ 
Thinking in different words 

I'm not leaving you/ No way friend, you'd ever last/ 
Yo no voye/ Sweet earth boy/ 
You'll have to think and wait 

Given wide skies to search and fly/ 
It would sure seem to me that it's so / 
Full of everything, either seen or unseen/ 
Endless night 
displays, cosmic death rays/ 
That hold your feet in place while/ 
Your mind runs away/ 
What I didn't know is that no one's going/ 
This 
old bus sits while jungles laugh and sing/ 
Nobody filled me in 

Carlos, gracias por ser nuestro pez favorito
