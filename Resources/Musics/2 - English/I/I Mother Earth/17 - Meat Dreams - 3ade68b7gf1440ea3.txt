MEAT DREAMS

Two ripe for solar, tender rust 
Too unfortunate to wake up 
Not a problem, don't blame us 
In the warm of daylight's cunt 
In the black hole of cream and sunbeds 
In the break of a strong fast 
In the opened heart of awareness there is us 

She said how we get there doesn't matter 
It's all how you breathe...and stay kind 
And that I'm an enlightened bear 
Though a scavenger through with scavenging 
In a moment I'll lose my mind 
In an hour I'll lose my substance 
In my prime years I might unwind 
On my deathbed I'll think of us as good on earth 
My yarrow, my aloe and my changing needs 

Smooth isn't effortless, soon doesn't wallow 
In a poet's hands awakened 
She's a moderate sexual artist 
In a snowblind we are a fire 
In the headlights we are a rabbit 
In our downtime we're always on 
In the dawn of time we were right there giving birth 
A new lemon, two apples and the dream 
Of us all 

Entangled in the wet girl 
Her island unto myself 
Entangled like a left turn 
When you lean on somebody else 
We'll need the wise and fortunate to help out 
Just so you know 
We'll need the fire and effect of everything 
We tell to ourselves 
Underneath the red ringing bell 
Wondering who has been here before and fell 
Underheath our vanity's high hope tight rope glow 
So no-one knows we've become one 

The most we can offer is awe and a well 
Of intention 
What is saved isn't lost here 
Underneath the red ringing bell
