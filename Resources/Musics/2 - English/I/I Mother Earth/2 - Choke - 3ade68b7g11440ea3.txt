CHOKE

Rev high 
Bend low and free the dead word 
When I stand up and feel the head burst 
WHen i stand out i'll hold it under 
When I stand down I won't be down for long 
Remember why you're not along 

You choke 
You take the dive and wonder why 
You never elevated 
You swallow 
Your sky is dry 
You're passing time alive 
And medicated 

A sublime death dream 
Time gets to you like a lover 
A broad side, full on dread 
Gets to the one alone 
It grabs you by the bone and swings 
You up and all around 

You choke 
You take the dive and wonder why 
You never elevated 
You swallow 
Your sky is dry 
You're passing time alive 
And medicated 
You've run away from something sure 
When you own your fear, feel undead 
Feel undead and unlike anyone 
Don't let it air out 

Some will take it on the chin 
I will meditate and know other lifetimes while the sum 
Of almost every sorry will always find a way 
Home and the way I long to love long and matter... live long in you
