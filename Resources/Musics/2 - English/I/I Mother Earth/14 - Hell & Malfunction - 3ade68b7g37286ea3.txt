HELL & MALFUNCTION

One night I fell 
Rolled over, caught some good air home 
Above a deep, ferocious hillside 
Hell and malfunction 
We know, need, feel, want 
We'll grow it in our mind's sun 
To all feed someone 

Save all from their mountains 
Save all from their drowning 
Save all from their endless nights 
Their suicides 

So then I sink 
In slow motion, can't hold my breath long 
In water's deep aloha half-smile 
It's swim or be sunken 
And know there's no one to get me out 
From under 
So help me someone 

Save all from their mountains 
Save all from their drowning 
Save all from their endless nights 
Their suicides 
Save all from their mountains 
Save all from their drowning 
Save all from their restless nights 
Their suicides 

A no-win in no light, in no pain, it ain't right 
Make that strap tight, take my air away, make my chest ache 
I will stay awake, I will think of love, think of truth 
Think of why I never really said enough 
I never won, I never showed enough 
I fucking never had a run and it's too late now 

One night in hell 
I strolled outside, a breath of sweet air 
Cold, in bare, wet feet, I know I've woken 
It's got to mean something 

Save all from their mountains 
Save all from their drowning 
Save all from their sadness 
Save all from their ranting 
Save all from their silence 
Save all from their grounding 
Save all from their endless nights 
Their suicides
