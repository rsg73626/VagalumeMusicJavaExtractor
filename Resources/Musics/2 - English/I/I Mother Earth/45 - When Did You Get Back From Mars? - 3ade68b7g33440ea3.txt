WHEN DID YOU GET BACK FROM MARS?

We never thought that you were gone until we turned the lights on
and spoke to your god but he ain't saying nothing,
except for some thing about your life going to waste in more ways then one
I never liked him anyways
You push it most days when you're young
and then one day they grow up and everyone's wrong
they can't teach you nothing they give you nothing
so you get thinking maybe there's a phase where everyone floats
south in never ending lemonade
Inside of myself, daylight is almost waking up slow and wondering
how sometimes it isn't always good here
What made you go and when did you get back from mars
You circled 'round odd fallen stars and reached out for the lightning
until you were stung until there was a nice ring,
the only right thing so you get thinking maybe in a way
I'll never know for sure the full sad of everyone
And hey, is there anyone known who gets along just great
with everyone on all the days.
