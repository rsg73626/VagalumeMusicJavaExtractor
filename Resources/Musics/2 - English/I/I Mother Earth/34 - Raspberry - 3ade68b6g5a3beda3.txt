RASPBERRY

Held in hands, a warm cup
Of skin always taken in by peers
And friends and the heightened fears
Over the years
Now I know I'm not like everyone

In this head I see the ground
You came from, unknown, undug
From where you were staying in
A backyard bed until
We came together

Raspberry, in my hand
You feel alright but I don't
Know if I am
I can't change
What I am right now, but
I'll be fine in the next life

I know I can say, I'm honest
With myself and with
My red tasty gem
And sure they will try, but
They can't take away
My secret loving friend

And on a good day, my mind
Is like the country...green wide open
A breath of zen that's nice
On the eyes, lonely, without a prayer

Take the trip that I have 
I am at risk
But I guess you know...

Explosions
From the goldfish bowl
Visions
Of blue girls crying stars
The more the garden sings
The harder it gets to stay in
There are a lot of choices
So many voices ruling me
So many of them at once
Yelling, "Everything's a mess"... I know
