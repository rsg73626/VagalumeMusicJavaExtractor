LIKE THE SUN

In light of my present mess
In light of my mental weather's turn
In light of all the crash and burn
I'll open my mind as wide as ever

The lie behind the lesson, the soul in the open well
It might have been fate, It might have been fortune
It might have been wine and a mellow head

I'm finding my way, Finding the words
One body breaking
Someone come and rise up
Rise like the sun
If I am no one, Somebody save me
Someone come and rise up

Pride doesn't own me now
But know that at times life kinda hurts
And know that I will live and learn
So more than survive, I will endeavour

The mind behind the message, Alone on an ocean swell
It might have been grace, It might have gorgeous
It might have been why I've settled in

I'm finding my way, Finding the words
One body breaking
Someone come and rise up
Rise like the sun
If I am no one, Somebody save me
Someone come and rise up
Rise and show

A helpless man, a held out hand
Defining images that flow through my hope's 
Surrender 
the broken moments and pointing fingers
The closing of open minds
I might have been delayed, I might have been delirious
I might have been otherwise
Taking hammer blows Like an animal
For others
So heavy was my weight

I'm finding my way
Finding the words
One body breaking
Someone come and rise up
Rise like the sun
You'll find the world
Somebody save me
Someone come and rise up

I'm finding my way, Finding the words
One body breaking
Someone come and rise up
Rise like the sun
If I am no one, Somebody save me
Someone come and rise up 
Rise and show

Show us
Something
