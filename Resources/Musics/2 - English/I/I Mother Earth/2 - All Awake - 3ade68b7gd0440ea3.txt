ALL AWAKE

Look for me to climb fallen trees in yellow summer look for me
in wide falling fields of bohemia all awake with a heavy hand holding me down
I stay all awake in the only fear of falling hall of fame we're all awake
under the weight eleven ways why you never fall to pieces you can't carry
we're all awake and looking for ways to save your self-love
Looking to define masterbation using colours looking for a ride to a place
where everyone was friends all awake with an energy,
a hustle and a fade all awake in the hell of free electric salad days they fall away

When the money's in your hand, when smaller men feel broken,
