SO GENTLY WE GO

Fill my head with
Your nonsense
You can breathe my breath
Till I turn red
Close your eyes
Try to follow me
If you close your eyes
You can become me
You can park your shoes
On my front step
Then gently walk barefoot
Through my sunken chest
I'll shade my eyes from
The burning sun
But feel confident
'Cause we're as bold
As love... and laughter

Wake me up when
The day is late
so I can watch the sunset
and go back to bed
And dream so real
A fantastic stage
Psychodramatic means to
Uncertain ends
I'll scare you blind with
My confidence
As cool as Jesus
And his twelve best friends
The reason we can
Do these things is that
The Earth has told
Of an outrageous spring...
Remembered

We'll meet for breakfast
In the sun room
The feeling in my soul
As sweet as good perfume
Leave your sex
At the door... come in
There's ecstasy for all
No need to leave your name
Pirouettes
We will make in game
On the ceiling
Movies of our lives will play
The reason we can
Do these thngs is that
Our minds are clouded
And we can't see
Straight

Maybe I've playedv My part
But it's a players
Art
Me and my friends
We were just living... playing
I've heard the sound
That silence makes
And I realize the world
Can break
From the inside out
Or outside in
