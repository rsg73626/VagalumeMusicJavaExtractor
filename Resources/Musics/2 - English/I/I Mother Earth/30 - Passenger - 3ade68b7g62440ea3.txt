PASSENGER

Then I woke, seven whole days gone 
The sunrise is perfect 
Taking aim, changing colours while it burns 
It made my stomach turn 
It made me quite unsure 
A lesser diamond on a road with no horizon 
Then it comes...I'm stardust 

When a day hasn't been torture let me know 
I'll find a way up, celebrate, then wake up 
On the ground 
I may define disturbed 
A mental village burned 
Connect to silence, say a prayer, let go of the rope 
Then let it come 

Now i'm done and I know 
Because it hurts in all ways 
In other words I am a passenger 
A dream that's over 

I'll let your wild ocean 
Hold my light while you're quite broken...it's alright 
I'll let the emotion roll my eyes 
If not I apologize 

Now I'm done 
For once in my life I hurt 
A slow train has overturned 
And I am a passenger
