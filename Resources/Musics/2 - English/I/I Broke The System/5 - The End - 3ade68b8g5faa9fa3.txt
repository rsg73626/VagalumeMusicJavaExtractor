THE END

The End - I Broke The System
EP: Kings Of The Mountain

Closer
The end is closer
You made it
Your loser

CLOSER
THE END IS CLOSER
ISN'T A FANTASY
IS THE REALITY

The words you say
Are incomplete
You're so gay

I have to get drunk
Before the end
Of this trunk
OF THIS TRUNK

THE END OF WORLD
