Rachel - I Broke The System
         EP: Kings Of The Mountain

Girl, you just run away
I want you here today
hear the things you have to say
you have the key of my heart
as the brightest star
you have your art

As will be tomorrow?
Rachel, I don't want your sorrow
I will see you on my dreams
protect you from your fears

Rachel you have all
have you see the waterfall
you don't have to bring the fall

Don't be shady
because you're my lady
you're my fate
like I'm always late

As will be tomorrow?
Rachel, I don't want your sorrow
I will see you on my dreams
protect you from your fears
protect you from your fears
FROM YOUR FEARS
