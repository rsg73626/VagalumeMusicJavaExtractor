FOR ALL THOSE DEADS

For All Those Deads - I Broke The System
                      EP: Kings Of The Mountain

We have to find a better way
to take you far that same old day
I'm taking you to another place

Like my father
standing on the rain
looking to my eyes
and this is what he says

THE TIME HAD COME
(look at what you become)
IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD
(it's for all those deads)

I broke the system of this town
I turn the button down 2x

The time had come
(LOOK AT WHAT YOU BECOME)
It's all in my head
(IT'S FOR ALL THOSE DEADS)
