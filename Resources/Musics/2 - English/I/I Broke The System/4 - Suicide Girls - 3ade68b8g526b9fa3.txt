SUICIDE GIRLS

Suicide Girl - I Broke The System
EP: Kings Of The Mountain

You're so terrible
awesome or horrible
you're my suicide
you're what I never pride

Girl, blonde one, death or pray?
I will paint it in gray
if you didn't say

My suicide
that's what you have
have to dicide
it's you or me?
I can't see
my suicide girl

our vows, are irrelevant now
after you leave this town
you bring me down
SUICIDE GIRL

My suicide
that's what you have
have to dicide
it's you or me?
I can't see
my suicide girl
suicide
why
suicide

SUICIDE
