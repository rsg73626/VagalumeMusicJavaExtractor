PIECES OF YOU

Staring at the white on my walls and I know, that your gone this time and I, can't bring myself, up to believe, that you're really leaving me, how will I live, what will I do, these are the things I think about, because you left me here all by myself. 

It's easier to put down than to let go You're letting me down and I'm losing control 
Stop letting me down… 

Every day these past three years that I ever had a doubt you told me not to worry because everything will always work out 
But now I'm standing here without you and wondering what I could have done to keep you here, and always be with me now I'm stuck with faded memories… 

It's easier to put down than to let go you're letting me down and I'm losing control I'm scared I don't know what to do 
Stop letting me down…
