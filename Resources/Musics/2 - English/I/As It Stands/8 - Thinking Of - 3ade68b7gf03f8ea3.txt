THINKING OF

I made the tears run down your face, but I didn't mean it. I wanted to say I'm sorry, but I didn't know how to say it. When you told me how much I meant to you, why didn't I see it? But I promise to never break your heart again… 
Because all I want is you with me, and all I need is your heart By my side, and all I want is your love, because you're the only one that I think of… 

When you told me that I was wrong, and you left me I knew I was the one to blame 
Don't know what to say Now that I'm on my own way, don't know how I should feel anymore 
But I'm so blue without you being here with me I cry each time I hear your name your name… 

Because all I want is you with me, and all I need is your heart By my side, and all I want is your love, because you're the only one that I think of… When I'm alone…
