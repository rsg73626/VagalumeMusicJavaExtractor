NINTH LIFE

What else could go wrong today? another speeding ticket, another fine, more things that I can't pay. My credit card is due my phone bill is two months late, my homework's not done and I feel overwhelmed. 

But I'm thinking is your vision of my life keeping you awake at night? because I don't want to let myself slip away 
from your arms… 

I'm looking at you and nothing's changed not the same old shit of changing around Just to fit in the crowd Never looking for the trendy fad to follow. 

My credit card is due my phone bill is two months late my homework's not done And I feel overwhelmed 

And I'm thinking is your vision of my life keeping you awake at night? because I don't want to let myself slip away from your arms…
