MOVING ON

Since I've talked to you you're always on my mind it's like I've got a new best friend and I can't think of anything I'd rather do. 

Backing out because you've walked away backing out because it's hard to say words like that tend to bother me. 
You know I want to kiss you but I cannot find the time you know I want to miss you but your not mine. 

I'm losing my mind what would I say to you? I don't even know your name and if I tried what would you say to me? I don't even know your name but Id really like to know…. 

Although I'm in despair I saw you standing there that's when I started to stare I couldn't hold out longer than I needed to 

I'm losing my mind…
