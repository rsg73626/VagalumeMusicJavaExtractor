RUNNING IN PLACE

Well I'm nineteen years old 
I don't know where I'm going yet 
Or who I'm going to be 
Maybe its because I'm indecisive 
Or maybe just a little confused 
I'm so scared of the future 
And so hung up on the past 
Someone tell me what's wrong and what's going on 
Inside my fucked up head 

Give me some sign 
What is my point in being here? 
Tell me what's going on 
With this world today 

Maybe I need some time alone 
So I can decide on my own 
What is right for me? 

Thought I had it all figured out 
I'd be a veterinarian and a part-time football star 
But the novelty wore off so fast 
That I was stuck at the beginning again 
I'm still scared of the future 
And still hung up on the past 
Someone tell me is what I'm doing 
Something I won't regret? 

Give me some sign 
What is my point in being here? 
Tell me what's going on 
With this world today 
Tell me where it went wrong 
So I have something to lean on 
Give me a chance to learn 
What I want for me 
Maybe I need some time alone 
So I can decide on my own 
What is right for me?
