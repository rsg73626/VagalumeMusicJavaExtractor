KNOW IT ALL

You have this feeling inside, and it makes you want to run and hide, you're so scared. You've got your hands against the wall you've never felt this way you've never felt so small. 
Too scared to say you love her too scared to let your feelings show you know she's leaving but it's better than to be let go. 
Another Will Hunting you think you know it all but this time you've never been so wrong you're only just a boy falling for some girl yet you haven't told her exactly how you feel. 
She can't remember you and the last time that you met, she can't remember you you stupid fucking prick.. Will Hunting… 

Tell me what you have denied she feels the same as you inside. 
Too scared to say you love her too scared to let your feelings show you know she's leaving but it's better than to be let go. 

Another Will Hunting you think you know it all but this time you've never been so wrong you're only just a boy falling for some girl yet you haven't told her exactly how you feel Will Hunting…
