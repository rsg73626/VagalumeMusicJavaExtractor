DECEIT

I'd like to tell you what's on her mind her deceitful ways and all her lies, but I don't know what she's gonna do next when you turn your head. 

What turned you onto her last night? was it the look that she gave you? or something that she said was it me? where did she go…? 

She's looking at you, she's looking at me What did she say? 
Not much I wanted to hear not much she needed to say 

What turned you onto her last night? Was it the look that she gave you? Or something that she said, now she turns her head in shame and she is the one to blame I don't think she could waste my time she's looking at you she's looking at me what did she say? where did she go? 

Hang on, I'm off my feet again face down, I'm on the street again and I am willing to change… 
What turned you onto her last night…? I don't think I want to know…
