LEFT ON HOLD

I can't believe that you're with me, am I living in my dreams and I can't see tell me, are we together don't pinch me just in case, because I don't want to wake up alone. 

Tell me, what you want tell me, what I've got to hold onto don't leave me here alone, standing by the phone.. cause you won't call. 
Leaving, on a Sunday train trying to catch you Am I too late? because leaving you was my worst mistake And if I could you know I'd take it away I would change the past if I could I would hold you in my arms you know I would But leaving you and letting go Are two mistakes I know. 

Tell me, what you want Tell me, what I've got To hold onto Don't leave me here alone, standing by the phone Cause you won't call.
