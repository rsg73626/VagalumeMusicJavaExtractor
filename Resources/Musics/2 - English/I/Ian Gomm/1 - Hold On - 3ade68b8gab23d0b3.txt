HOLD ON

I've been drifting on the sea of heartbreak
Tryin' to get myself ashore
For so long, for so long

Listenin' to the strangest stories
Wondering where it all went wrong
For so long, for so long

But hold on hold on hold on
To what you've got
So hold on hold on hold on
To what you've got

I've been dreaming of a new tomorrow
And wakin' in the morning sun
For so long, for so long

There's no time for revolution
I've got to be travellin' on
Here so long, for so long

But hold on hold on hold on
To what you've got
So hold on hold on hold on
To what you've got

Hold on to what you've got
Hold on hold on hold on to what you got
Hold on hold on hold on to what you got

Hold on to what you've got, to what you've got
Hold on hold on hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you've got, to what you've got

Hold on hold on hold on to what you got
Hold on hold on hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you've got, to what you've got

Hold on hold on hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you've got, to what you've got
