WE ARE YOURS

You placed eternity in our hearts
We were yours from the very start
All we've known has been torn apart
And now we have forever
You gave a song for our souls to sing
And your life was the offering
Even death, it has lost its sting
Now we have forever

And you can't take away what the world didn't give
We were made for more, we were made for more
At the end of the day, this will remain
Forever we are yours, forever we are yours
You made a place at your table God
Paid the way for the poor and lost
Called us into your open arms
And now we have forever

And you can't take away what the world didn't give
We were made for more, we were made for more
At the end of the day, this will remain
Forever we are yours, forever we are yours
No one, no one can take your place
No life, no death can separate
Your love, your love has conquered the grave
You conquered the grave

And you can't take away what the world didn't give
We were made for more, we were made for more
At the end of the day, this will remain
Forever we are yours, forever we are yours
No, you can't take away what the world didn't give
We were made for more, we were made for more
At the end of the day, this will remain
Forever we are yours, forever we are yours
Forever we are yours, forever we are yours
We are yours
