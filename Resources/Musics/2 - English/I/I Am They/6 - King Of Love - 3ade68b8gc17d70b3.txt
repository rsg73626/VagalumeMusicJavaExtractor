KING OF LOVE

The king of love my shepherd is
Whose goodness faileth never
I nothing lack if I am his
And he is mine forever
And he is mine forever

Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul he leadeth
And where the verdant pastures grow
With food celestial feedeth

Never failing, ruler of my heart
Everlasting, lover of my soul
On the mountain high or in the valley low
The king of love my shepherd is
The king of love my shepherd is

Lost and foolish off I strayed
But yet in love he sought me
And on his shoulder gently laid
And home rejoicing brought me

In death's dark veil I fear no ill
With thee, dear lord, beside me
Thy rod and staff my comfort still
Thy cross before to guide me

Never failing, ruler of my heart
Everlasting, lover of my soul
On the mountain high or in the valley low
The king of love my shepherd is
The king of love my shepherd is

Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah

Never failing, ruler of my heart
Everlasting, lover of my soul
On the mountain high or in the valley low
The king of love my shepherd is

Never failing, ruler of my heart
Everlasting, lover of my soul
On the mountain high or in the valley low
The king of love my shepherd is
The king of love my shepherd is

And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never
Good shepherd, may I sing your praise
Within your house forever
Within your house forever
