AWAKE MY LOVE

I've been walking through this life
Feeling empty on the inside
Just when I thought my hope had died
You were there to bring me back to life

You, you awake my love
You renew my strength
You restore my heart
You, you invite me in
You begin my song
You awake my love

I was a cold and heavy heart
I was desperate for a new start
That's when your love came rushing in
And I am never going back again

You, you awake my love
You renew my strength
You restore my heart
You, you invite me in
You begin my song
You awake my love

Every burden, lifted
Every sorrow, you washed away
You're turning ashes to glory
And fill my life with singing

You, you awake my love
You renew my strength
You restore my heart
You, you invite me in
You begin my song
You awake my love

Oh you, you awake my love
You renew my strength
You restore my heart
Jesus you, you invite me in
You begin my song
You awake my love
You awake my love
Oh, you awake my love
