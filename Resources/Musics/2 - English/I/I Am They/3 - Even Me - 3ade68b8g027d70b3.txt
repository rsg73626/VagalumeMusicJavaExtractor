EVEN ME

He knows my thoughts
The things that no one sees
He knows my heart
It's every broken piece
Somehow still I'm held by this one thing
And somehow still I'm held by this one thing

Yes, Jesus loves me
Even me, even me
I stand forgiven and free
Even me, even me

He knows my past
The choices I have made
When I have wandered
When I pushed away
Somehow still I'm held by this one thing
Somehow still I'm held by this one thing

Yes, Jesus loves me
Even me, even me
I stand forgiven and free
Even me, even me
Even me, yes even me

Nothing could ever stop this love
Nothing could ever take it away
My life was lost, his life he gave
Even to the grave, even to the grave
Even to the grave

Yes, Jesus loves me
Even me, even me
I stand forgiven and free
Even me, he loves even me

Yes, Jesus loves me
Even me, even me
I stand forgiven and free
Even me, he loves even me
Even me, he loves even me
Even me, even me
