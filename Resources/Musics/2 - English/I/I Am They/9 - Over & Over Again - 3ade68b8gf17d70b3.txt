OVER & OVER AGAIN

Wake me up from my slumber, oh God
Take these shaking hands and hold them still
Wake me up from my slumber, oh God
Lift my eyes to yours, where my help comes from

Over and over again, your love and your mercy begin
No matter how far, you find me where I am

When my fears chase my failures, oh God
Oh when heaven's glow seems so far
Wake me up to your glory, oh God
Draw my eyes to yours, where my help comes from
I will find you

Over and over again, your love and your mercy begin
No matter how far, you find me where I am

Over and over again, your love and your mercy begin
No matter how far, you find me where I am

In my suffering and
In my weakness and
When from you I ran
You find me
In the dark of sin
When I'm there again
You find me, you find me

In my suffering and
In my weakness and
When from you I ran
You find me
In the dark of sin
When I'm there again
You find me, you find me

Over and over again, your love and your mercy begin
No matter how far, you find me where I am

Over and over again (your mercy falls)
You are faithful to the end (and you lift me up)
No matter how far, you find me where I am
Over again

Wake me up to your glory, oh God
Lift my eyes to yours, where my help comes from
