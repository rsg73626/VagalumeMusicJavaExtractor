YOUR LOVE IS MINE

I walked alone, trying to find my way
On winding roads and paths that I had made
Wandering so far from grace
I'd given up on things that I believe
My hopes and dreams were buried in the sea
But you were there, calling out to me

Life will rise, death will die
Your love is mine, your love is mine
Stains washed white, you paid the price
Your love is mine, your love is mine
OO, oo, your love is mine, your love is mine
I once was lost and burdened by my shame
But you took the cross and suffered in my place
You rescued me, I belong to you

Life will rise, death will die
Your love is mine, your love is mine
Stains washed white, you paid the price
Your love is mine, your love is mine
OO, oo, your love is mine, your love is mine

I called your name
You looked my way, you looked my way
I called your name
You looked my way, you looked my way
I called your name
You looked my way, you looked my way
I called your name
What could separate, what could separate

Life will rise, death will die
Your love is mine, your love is mine
Stains washed white, you paid the price
Your love is mine, your love is mine
OO, oo, your love is mine, your love is mine
OO, oo, your love is mine, your love is mine
