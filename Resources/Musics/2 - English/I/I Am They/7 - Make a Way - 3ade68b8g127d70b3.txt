MAKE A WAY

You brought me to the desert so you could be my water
You brought me to the fire so you could be my shield
You brought me to the darkness
so you could be my morning light
If you brought me this far, if you brought me this far

Wherever you lead me, I know you won't leave me
Wherever you call me, you will make a way
Wherever we're going, I will be holding
To the promise you have made
You will make a way
You will make a way

And when I'm in the valley, you will be my comfort
And when I'm at the end of me, I find you there
When I'm in the battle, you will be my present peace
Cause you brought me this far, you brought me this far
If you brought me this far

Wherever you lead me, I know you won't leave me
Wherever you call me, you will make a way
Wherever we're going, I will be holding
To the promise you have made
You will make a way
My God will make a way

Cause you brought me this far
You brought me this far
You brought me this far
You will make a way

You brought me this far
You brought me this far
You brought me this far
My God will make a way

Wherever you lead me, I know you won't leave me
Wherever you call me, you will make a way
Wherever we're going, I will be holding
To the promise you have made

Wherever you lead me, I know you won't leave me
Wherever you call me, you will make a way
Wherever we're going, I will be holding
To the promise you have made
You will make a way
You will make a way
