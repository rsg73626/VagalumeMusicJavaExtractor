BATMAN

Yo
You know you better watch out
When I've got my boomerang
'Cause I will not think twice
To bust your ass

You know i feel pretty good
When I've got my armor on
These mother fucking punks
Think they run my town

(chorus)
'Cause I run through the village
Because I am Batman
I fight all the villains
Because I am Batman
Fight crime every day
Fight crime every nite
Willpower stronger than steel

If you cross my path
You must face my wrath
Rocking in Gotham
Because I am Batman
Oh yes

With my utility belt
I'll use my grappling hook
And i will fly through the skies
In my Dark Knight disguise

Is everybody ok?
I'd really like to know
The Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler
I don't care at all

(chorus)
