JIMMY HENSON

Ninja Turtle arms on a GI Joe
It's just an underground city of dwarves
Hey Hey Hey

Brother Wayne Sharp is a badass dude
He's got a new tattoo
He's just a badass dude

I said Jimmy Jimmmy-ho
Jimmy-ho-ho-ho
I said the lady needs
A little bit of rock and roll
I got one dollar and seven cents
That's one cup of noodles
And a can of beans

(chorus)
Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh

Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh

Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh

Where in the world is Jimmy Henson
Woah-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh
