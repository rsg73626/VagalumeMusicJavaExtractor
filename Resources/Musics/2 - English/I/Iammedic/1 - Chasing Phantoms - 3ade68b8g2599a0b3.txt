CHASING PHANTOMS

I've lost my sheep
And now there's no sleep
You're counting beats
While my hearts' lost at sea

I can't sleep
'cause I'm lost in a moment
That we've placed under torment
Oh I can't breathe
As we chase after phantoms
I've been taken at the palm of your hands

Chewed up and spit out
I'm bones under the house
My ghost walks about
Irritating like dirt in the mouth

She's gone, threw up the deuces
She's out, I'm feeling stupid
And she'll come back this time
And I'll stop living lies

But all the maybe's
And the what if's drive me out my mind
I need a second chance
You know a quick rewind
I sit here my life severed
My head fell off the vine
I'm fading out of touch
I'm running out of time

I can't sleep
'cause I'm lost in a moment
That we've placed under torment
Oh I can't breathe
As we chase after phantoms
I've been taken at the palm of your hands

As we chase after phantoms
I've been taken at the palm of your hands

Let me go
I'm caught up in the moment
Someone take me from this torment
Oh let me go
'cause I've been chasing phantoms
And my death is now a pattern

I can't sleep
Can't eat
Can't think
(I can't be)
(there's no breathe)
(no life)
(no death)
(no love, love, love)

As we chase after phantoms
I've been taken at the palm of your hands

Let me go

There's no sleep
There's no sleep
