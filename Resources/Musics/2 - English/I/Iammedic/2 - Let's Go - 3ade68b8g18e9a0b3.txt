LET'S GO

We say oh oh oh oh, come on baby lets go
Go ga go go go ga go go
Let me take you away

We say oh oh oh oh, come on baby lets go
Go ga go go go ga go go
We say hey the party's bumpin
Hey we got it bangin

We got it jumpin get your hands up
Keep em' pumpin!

Let me take you away... baby just you and me
Get ready for a good time
Take a sip of this drink and dance the night away
Don't tell me your name we'll just be who we are
Gettin down like rockstars
Put your head on my chest and let me do the rest

Let the rhythm take you up up up and away
As the bass kicks, snares hit
We feelin ok
Now the heat is up up up in a blaze
Let the speakers pop
Clothes drop
Let's party away

We say oh oh oh oh, come on baby lets go
Go ga go go go ga go go
We say hey the party's bumpin
Hey we got it bangin
We got it jumpin get your hands up
Keep em' pumpin!
We say oh oh oh oh, come on baby lets go
Go ga go go go ga go go
We say hey the party's bumpin
Hey we got it bangin
We got it jumpin get your hands up
Keep em' pumpin!

Baby baby tell all your friends that we're running away
We're leaving on the first plane
Just pack what you need and we'll be on our way

Let the rhythm take you up up up and away
As the bass kicks, snares hit
We feelin ok
Now the heat is up up up in a blaze
Let the speakers pop
Clothes drop
Let's party away

We say oh oh oh oh, come on baby lets go
Go ga go go go ga go go
We say hey the party's bumpin
Hey we got it bangin
We got it jumpin get your hands up
Keep em' pumpin!
We say oh oh oh oh, come on baby lets go
Go ga go go go ga go go
We say hey the party's bumpin
Hey we got it bangin
We got it jumpin get your hands up
Keep em' pumpin!

On the hood of my car we'll be watchin the stars
In the back of the club we'll be dancin it uh uh up
Diamonds on your neck, girl I'm showing you love
Before this night is over we'll be wrappin it up
