AMERICAN IDOL

I wanna be on my T.V.
I wanna wish that I was me
If I could just be 23 forever
I'd be the heartthrob of the tweens

Vegas lives inside my veins
Dating Britney is my dream

(so watch yourself)

American idle
Cash and style
Tell me what I'm worshipping
American idle
We need revival
Bigger than the next big thing, that's right
We need to see the light

Disney's renting out my head
Hefner redesigned my bed
My conscience chimes in like a prize announcer
To tell me good times are ahead

I snuggle with my credit cards
I pray "God bless the mega-stars!"

(go watch yourself)

Hey (Hey) Ho (Ho)
Throw your mojo out the window
Hey (Hey) Ho (Ho)
Lose the world but baby gain your soul
