AMPLIFIED

Got a question for the next generation
Would you stand to your feet
And fall in line for your interrogation
Tell us what you believe?

Alright, alright, so who wants the mic?
Tonight I might call you to testify

Hey, kids get amplified
Cos' you just can't hide when it burns inside, I say
Hey, kids get amplified tonight

There's a fire that we call redemption
When it lights up your soul
It drops a bomb on your false pretensions
You want the whole world to know

Alright, alright, so who wants the mic?
Tonight I might call you to testify

Hey, kids get amplified
If it's worth your love then it's worth your life, I say
Hey, kids get amplified tonight

It's not about our glory
It's the story that rocks the whole world

Alright, alright, I'll give you the mic
Tonight, tonight, I want you to testify
