I LOVE TO TELL THE STORY

I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above
Of Jesus and His glory
Of Jesus and His love

And nothing else can do
Because I know it's true

I love to tell the story
It'll be my theme in glory
I wanna tell the world
Of Jesus and His love
I love to tell the story
It'll be my theme in glory
For some have never heard
Of Jesus and His love

I love to tell the story
It's pleasant to repeat
It seems each time I tell it
More wonderfully sweet

And nothing else can do
Because I know its true

And when I stand in glory
And seem Him face to face
I'll sing the only story
Of His amazing grace

I love to tell the story

Of His love
I love to tell the story
Cuz nothing satisfies
Like Jesus and His love
