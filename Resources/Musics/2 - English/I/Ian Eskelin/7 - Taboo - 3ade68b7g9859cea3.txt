TABOO

For the sake of argument
Say Jerry Springer were the president
"No Inhibitions!"
The national theme
There'd still be one thing
Makin' Donahue scream

"Taboo!"
We've come to the last
Taboo
There's an audible gasp
When you claim there's a God
Who's objectively true
It's taboo

Party on, let freedom ring
For the shock jocks and the gangsta kings
But mention Jesus in the public square
The tables turn and the tempers flare

Taboo
That's a no-can-do
Taboo
The A.C.L.U.
Say when we sneeze
Could we please
Drop the "God bless you"
It's taboo

God isn't really dead
He's under house arrest
Will Amnesty protest?
No I don't think so

I could kiss a kangaroo
Sic my Spitz on your Shih Tzu
No one blinks at anything I do
Until I claim the resurrection is true

"Taboo!"
I'm breaking the last
Taboo
How about you?
Do you claim Jesus' name
As the ultimate truth?
Taboo
