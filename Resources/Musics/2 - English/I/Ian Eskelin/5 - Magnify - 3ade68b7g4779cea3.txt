MAGNIFY

You are my hope
You are the fire
My truth

All of my life
All I desire
Is You

What a wonderful Saviour
What a beautiful truth
What a glorious God and King
Let creation sing

Magnify Your holy name
To worship in Your presence
Is the reason I was made
Magnify Your holy name
Let the angels cry and my soul reply
Magnify

Heart of my heart
Song of my song
My King

All that I have
All that I am
I bring

What a wonderful Saviour
What a beautiful truth
What a merciful mighty King
Let Your praises ring

And I sing

Holy, holy is Your name
Worthy, worthy to be praised
Holy, holy is Your name
Let the angels cry and my soul reply
Magnify
