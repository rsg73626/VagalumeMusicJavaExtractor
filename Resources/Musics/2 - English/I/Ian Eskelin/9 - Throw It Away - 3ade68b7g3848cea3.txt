THROW IT AWAY

I tried to fill the hole with Baywatch beauties
I tried to fill it up with Juji Fruit
I tried to fill it with a happy ending
I tried to fill it with a business suit

I'm with stupid most of the time
I pay for the things that you can't really buy

Throw it away, it's not the real thing
Throw it away, it's all a lie
Nothing but God can fill that hole inside
Nothing else is worthy of our lives

It's like the currency of Argentina
It's like the buzz about a dot com stock
I bought a lot of things to make me happy
I bought a lot of ways to belly flop

I'm with stupid most of the time
I cling to the things that'll never be mine

An observation on a reputation
An observation on a pedigree
An observation on the observation
Of money, muscle, and celebrity

Throw it away, it's not the real thing
Throw it away, it's all a lie
Nothing but God can fill that hole inside
Nothing else is worth our passion
Nothing else is worthy of our lives
