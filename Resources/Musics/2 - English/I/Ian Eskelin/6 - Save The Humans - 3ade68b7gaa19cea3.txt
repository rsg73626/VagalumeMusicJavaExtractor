SAVE THE HUMANS

Save the humans, they're in distress
Save the humans, we're an awful mess
Let me tell you baby we got problems
As a species we're unfit to solve 'em

We can purify the oily seas
We can empathize with manatees
Even chit-chat with chimpanzees
But we're still dyin' from a sin disease

We're in the water and the water's hot
Yeah, we need somethin' that we ain't got
oooooOOOOOO let's go

Whoaa whoaa Come and rescue me
Whoaa whoaa Gimme what I need
Whoaa whoaa We're a dying breed
One hope baby only God can save the humans now

Sink the whaling ships save the whales
Kick out the French save the baby snails
Stop the interstellar radiation
But we can never be our own salvation

We need somebody who can take control
We need somebody who can save our souls
oooooOOOOOO let's go

Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, God save the humans!

Whoaa whoaa Come and rescue me
Whoaa whoaa From my humanity
Whoaa whoaa We're a dying breed
One hope baby only God can save the humans now

Save The Humans
