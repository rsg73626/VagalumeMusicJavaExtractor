THE SOLID ROCK

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

My hope is built on nothing less
Than His righteousness alone
And so I'll stand faultless
Before the throne

When all around my soul gives way
I will lean on Jesus' name

When darkness tries to fill my days
I've got His unchanging grace
Cos' at the cross He said my name
And took my place

When everything comes crumbling down
In Him alone I will be found

My hope is built on nothing less
