INTO YOUR ARMS

Welcome to my big mistakes
Selfish dreams and wasted days
Welcome to the part of me I hate

I come to You with head in hands
The little bit I understand
Compels me to confess my wicked ways

I wanna be the man who can't pretend
Cos' nothings left here worth defending now

Take my life, take it all
I surrender as I fall
Into Your arms again
Take my dreams, set me free
Let Your mercy catch me as I fall
Into Your arms again

Soon enough there comes a day
When no one here will know our names
And everything we made is washed away

I'm back again with heart in hand
Cos' here's the thing I understand
It's all about the way we finally break

So I wanna be the man on hands and knees
Who doesn't try to hide his poverty

Draw me down to my defeat
Let your grace wash over me
We all need redemption just the same
Let it rain

Cover me, cover me
Hold me in Your hands of mercy
Cover me, cover me
Only You alone are worthy
