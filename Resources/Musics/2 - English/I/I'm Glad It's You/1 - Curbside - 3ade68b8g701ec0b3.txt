CURBSIDE

Take a long last look at everything
That means anything to you and me
There's not a thing left to say
Just watch it all fade away
And it's a funny thing
The way it all still runs through me
And if it's all you leave me with, I don't even mind
Just a long last look at everything we were before

Most days and most nights
You spend your time trying to hide
In the last breaths of your past
Pretending to be anything that'll distract you
From the life that you let go
But I know that it's hard
When everything reminds you that you're always falling behind
Everything reminds you that you're probably wasting your time
Everything reminds you that you can't ever be what you were
But at least you can say

If you didn't stand by me, I'd be alone
If you didn't stand by me, I'd still be alone
It was a life that I stole from late nights on curbsides
And I can't seem to ever get it back
You were my only peace of mind
It left when you left
And I can't seem to ever get it back
