COLLECTOR

I feel fine when the stars align
I feel fine when my body's warm
You feel fine fucking all the time
It fucking feels cold

It's just the kids these days
They make me feel so old
I don't feel comfortable in my own skin
I think the best is only over

The night is slowly closing in
And I'm staring at my thighs
You watch an episode and nothing more
I think I'd rather not be sober

I feel fine when I'm walking home
The cold waits til I get inside
But I can't tell the difference
I hate you for this

It feels like yesterday
You were closing up my blinds
You didn't want the world to see you
In my bed and sleeping past morning

It's hard enough to say
I'm taking care of myself
When I'd give the world for nothing more
Than a call, just telling me you're still the same

You collect
When I grind my teeth
When it's hard to breathe
You collect
When I watch the time
When you're on my mind
You collect
When I see your name
When I blame the pain
You collect
You collect
