OUR SMALLEST ADVENTURES

We've found ourselves
in clueless company
and spoke of things
that we can not repeat
We've trapped our tounges
and stumbled on our midnight steps

Oh, and how i know you best

but i would cut every corner to find you

there are simple leads we can follow
there's so many things we can do
but we're all tied up
and oh so lost
on our smallest adventures

There are simple routes we can follow

we could be complete
i'll take these times
for what i feel their worth

i'll take these times
for what i feel their worth

oh i believe
we could be complete
i'll take these times
for what it feel their worth
