AMMUNITION

Envy’s blade, ego plague
Tried to take me out twisted hate
Trap of lies took you down
Because you had to taste the bait

Red as blood and vague as the sky
I can’t believe the things you deny

Thankless art, loveless heart
Take it out on me to pass it through
Re-rejected, smoke curling
Clearly I must’ve got to you

Running the course, outside the line
You carve respect, from the swine

Keep your enemies close?
I say push them aside
Let you choke on the dust of
Your hate and your pride
Your failure is a fire
It’s killing you inside
Can’t you leave this where you
Left integrity behind

Who’s laughing?
Who’s laughing now?
Red as blood, and vague as the sky
I can’t believe, the things you deny

I’ll learn to use the flames
Keep feeding the inferno
Burning you inside
Burning up your mind
I won’t feed your guilt
I won’t feed your greed
I won’t feed your anger
Who’s laughing now?

Burning you inside
Burning out your mind
It’s killing you inside
