SHATTERED

Little holes show how hollow you have become
Fighter you've been down so low for far too long
This city now offers only nightmares to you
You are too sick of being so strong

Feet dangling in the open grave
Everyone else was always to blame
Present yourself like flower to the bee
Walking on, waking up losing dreams

You burn everything up to distinguish your spark
You're killing your little star so the can't find you in the dark
Breaking raw ambitions, open your palm over the flames
You say it's different this time
Yet this plan leads to the same

Stagnant air, time moves on and no you have not
Hope hovers overhead like city lights
In contrast reality seems aphotic
Too bleak too empty too grim in the night

Glass they pay to shatter cuts to the bone
You laugh it away with your veins exposed
Present yourself like flower to the bee
Walking on, waking up losing dreams

Peeling layers back, confirming fears
Tearing through hearts, screaming in their ears
Present yourself like flower to the bee
Walking on, waking up losing dreams
