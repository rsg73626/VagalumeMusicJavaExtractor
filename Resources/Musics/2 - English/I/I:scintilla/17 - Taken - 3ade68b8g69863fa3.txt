TAKEN

The answers may lie
In the bullets of a softer kind
They rewind
And conceal ammunition

They say they must lie
Edit mercilessly, cut, take and hide
Expose light
Erase all suspicion

If these illusions fill you
They'll abstract you they will bleed you

Punished for inspection
They keep us blind
What should be protected?
Don't close your eyes

The answers may lie
In the bullets of a softer kind
Cover cries
Defense of the censors

They say they must lie
Edit mercilessly, cut, take and hide
Slice the ties
Blur it all together

If these illusions fill you
They will abstract you the will bleed you
If these delusions fill you
They will dull you the will bleed you

Policing oppositions
Concealing their intensions
