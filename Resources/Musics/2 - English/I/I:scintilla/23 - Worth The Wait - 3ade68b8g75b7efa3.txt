WORTH THE WAIT

Under frozen after hours
Carnal words and dreams devoured
In here nothing else can matter
Disappear

Senses climb and take her with
Written like a fiery myth
Can't fight what is coming in
What is right

Sun crawling up skin
Wakes her from the trance

Says she'll be waiting
Can't leave this in the shadows
It's taken over
Will not let go
Says "ain't it funny, we don't believe in fate"
Please be patient
It's worth the wait

Greyed instincts
Blow off the dust
Wonders can she truly trust
Lighthouse on after dusk
Guide the night
History's harsh waves crash and tear
She tastes it in the salted air
There's a life just waiting there
Float away

A weightless sacrifice
A change worth the chance

Says she'll be waiting
Can't leave this in the shadows
It's taken over
Will not let go
Says "ain't it funny, we don't believe in fate"
Please be patient
It's worth the wait

If she folds she knows it won't be worth living the new year
If she goes she knows it will be worth all of the fear

Sun crawling up skin
Wakes her from the trance

Says she'll be waiting
Can't leave this in the shadows
It's taken over
Will not let go
Says "ain't it funny, we don't believe in fate"
Please be patient
It's worth the wait

Start over here
Start with the dreams matched
