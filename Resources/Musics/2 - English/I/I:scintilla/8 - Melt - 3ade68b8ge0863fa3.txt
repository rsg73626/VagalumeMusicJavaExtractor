MELT

I'm bending the cards of the four cups unfilled
A red cloud has settled over my skin
A cold carnal being, I breathe in your echoes
You're a man incarnate coloring and rolling

Each deep line of your palm runs and wraps around me
A coiling cover, I know what you need
I'm bound by your rhythm, I breathe in your echoes
We melt early winter with the notes we swallow

Lost in small circles
Felt pulses matched
The thin sheets melt
And unravel in your hands

You lift me like a seed; here I break free of form
With rain's ancient mark I'm the girl caught in the storm
It is not forever, but it is in-between
This is where we find the most of our meaning

We feel it in our veins, but it is in-between
The pleasure, the truth and what remains unseen
The mornings early heat burns and tattoos your back
The ink trickling down erases what we lack
