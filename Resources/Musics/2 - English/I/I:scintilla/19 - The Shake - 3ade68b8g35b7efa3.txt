THE SHAKE

My wires are crossed peeling and frayed
I'm losing more power everyday
Screaming at stars won't change a thing
Some people can break the strongest of wings

Sometimes I shake sometimes I scream
Just trying to wake from this bad dream

My sickness crawling out of my skin
Up walls to scale to jump to spin

You tore into my world with iron hands
Just take it, I don't want it as the hurt spans
Wish the sky could just rain down on me
And take my mind and wipe it clean

I don't want to take and I can't give
Can't shake this, I don't want to relive

Made the call, don't you feel better within
Because I don't, I can't, I won't win

I've got a scar that few can see
They reopen the wound that was healing

My sickness crawling out of my skin
Up walls to scale to jump to spin
Made the call, don't you feel better within
Because I don't, I can't, I won't win

Dark cloud, disavow
I should be stronger by now
Thought I would shake this somehow
I should be stronger by now
