OMEN

Drove brio under tongue
Swallowed pages of psalm
You threw verve over the edge to generate a calm
The house is much too quiet
Sometimes the days get so dark
Days mirror starless nights
When ending illusion is too hard

The omen feels so wrong
Instincts screaming
Wakeup and hold on
Please keep breathing
Tired of being strong
In search for higher ground
When the burden's pouring down
Please keep breathing

Consumed the history to control your demise
Counting the seconds to be embraced by the sky
This house is much too quiet
Past the crowd I felt you crack
From over a hundred miles
Turn around please come back

The omen feels so wrong
Instincts screaming
Wake up and hold on
Please keep breathing
Tired of being strong
In search for higher ground
When the burden's pouring down
Please keep breathing

Hold on, this is the call, reach out before slow descending
Black dawn, block the fall, this cannot be the ending
Defeat, deceit, slow repose, given one more chance
Fleeting, retreat, yellow rose, come take my hand
