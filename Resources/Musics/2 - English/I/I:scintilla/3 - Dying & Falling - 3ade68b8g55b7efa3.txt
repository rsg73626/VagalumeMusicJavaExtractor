DYING & FALLING

From one form to another
Make sense of chaos and disorder
Proof borrowed masks the sorrow
Truth in the sun as the source of order

In the mirrors light reflected
Bouncing off lies back into your eyes
Parallel wish
Enuma Elish
What's wrong with questioning the bias?

Diagonal against the grain
Where the gods could be our hearts and minds
We are dying
We are falling
But there's no reason why we can't rise

While we're here
But there's no reason why we can't rise
While we're here

We make it up as we go along
We all want something that lasts forever
Anyone could have it wrong
We all want something to last forever

No discord
Diminished crown
Heaven and hell are both right here
Translation
Speculation
They started a fire with our fear
Analyze
Remove folklore
What's left of the pretty story
Open mind
Extract morals
No reason to become the quarry
Hard to fake a sinless state
But keep a golden rule in mind
We are dying
We are falling
But there's no reason why we can't rise
While we're here

We make it up as we go along
We all want something that'll last forever
Anyone could have it all
We all want something to last forever

The question's carcass
Left out in the cold
He leaves it lying there
Wide open and exposed
