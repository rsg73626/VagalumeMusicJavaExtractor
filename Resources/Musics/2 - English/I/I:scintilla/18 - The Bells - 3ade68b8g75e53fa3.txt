THE BELLS

[with a quiet strength behind my heels
I have discovered where footsteps are placed placed among the constellations
I will keep the missing keys and disregard
The staircase, tragedies]

The fade proof lines
That define status and meaning
Are illegible, too thin to read
I've lost radiance
Under petals and softer words
The vine bleeds divine screams

Do your wings make a sound?
Sometimes i swear i can hear them
You left poison mercury dreams
Will you reveal what it means?

Taste the potency
Of your deadened knowledge
The decline through sifting perils
Forces you under
Stretch past the shattered arrows
The vine bleeds divine screams

Do your wings make a sound?
Sometimes i swear i can feel them
The florescent lighting does nothing
To keep you from hiding

[with a quiet strength behind my heels
I have discovered where footsteps are placed placed among the constellations
I will keep the missing keys and disregard
The staircase, tragedies]

Do your wings make a sound?
Sometimes i swear i can hear them
You left poison mercury dreams
Will you reveal what it means?

Do your wings make a sound?
I swear i can hear them
I can feel them
