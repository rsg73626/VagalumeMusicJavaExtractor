MOTHERSHIP

Your mistakes called out and closed the door
A special case arose from red
Punishment from reality denied
Face the question, the nine letters
A beginning only belonging to itself

You hear cries of both the sides
You stand centered over the division
Omit their influence, you’ll come to terms
Beyond the stalemate stands your decision
Under these lights you will know what’s right

They don’t have your concern under tin law
So be the judge, be the witness
Nothing to resemble a miracle
I’ll keep your verdict locked away
It will be hard to let the choice behind you lay

Are you strong enough
To do this alone as the lines blur
Examine all the sides, examine the lives
You’re not a thief, you’re not a killer
