SWIMMERS CAN DROWN

My timeline is a wire wrapped tight around my neck
Slowing apathy swells, give in to disconnect
Unworldly transmission fed to relive the shame
I don't want a trial, I'll take all the blame
A stone stolid council Speaks dogmatically
Bullets and antidotes divided evenly
A chilling consciousness wakes me from the trance
It redefines my mind I'll never have a chance

Nothing, giving, unworthy offering
Losing, feeling like a bird with clipped wings
Sinking feeling, pushing down on me
Swimming, drowning, neurotoxic red sea

The blow shatters my remission
Fracture patterns show through the skin
Please understand this was not the plan
No, I gotta know
Does it matter where my heart has been
Fracture patterns show through my skin
Please understand this was not my plan
No, I gotta go

Weightless restraint floating away, evaporating
The impulse grows in clouds below, cascading
Dripping whisper, falling faster, raining
