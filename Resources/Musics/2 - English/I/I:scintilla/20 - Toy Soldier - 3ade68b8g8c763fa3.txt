TOY SOLDIER

Stand against the sky
Force reasons to die
Till boots come untied
You'll try to believe his lie
Built beyond the archetype
Trick yourself into the fight
The soot and gun hide the night
Convince yourself that it's right
Master warhead puppetry
Undeserving idolatry
Inner circle loyalty
Make them flee their own country

Boy of the surge
Compliance won't make you a man
Now you've deciphered
The secret written in the sand

Now you understand
What rests in your hands
Clear and hold the land
By killing another man
Whose safety do you fight for?
Admit that you can't ignore
You don't trust those keeping score
Write letters to reassure
Gunshot rationality
Just a casual casualty
Just part of the strategy
But you're not setting them free

Sing of fires Sing of will
Sing to justify to kill
