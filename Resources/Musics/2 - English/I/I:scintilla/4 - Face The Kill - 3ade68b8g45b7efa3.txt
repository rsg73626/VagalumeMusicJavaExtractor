FACE THE KILL

Thin line hides the unknown
Red winged man in a papal throne
Czar says at least he's alive
Yet evidence proves otherwise

Where is heaven then over shadows of weaponry
Time bomb, dormant, hungry for a casualty

With blissful memories corroded
You desperately try to rebuild
Now that will is eroded
Face the man or face the kill

Now braced face hydra skies
Girl whispers, 'look into these eyes'
Reflect, illumine verities
Sit with the intense clarity

She moves in real close
Not for the weak and not for most
Let go, unfurl, transitional underworld

With blissful memories corroded
You desperately try to rebuild
Now that will is eroded
Face the man or face the kill
Looking back through the timeline
Confront thief that took the young lives
The sickness will spread until
You face the man or face the kill

Now braced face hydra skies
Girl whispers, 'look into these eyes'
Czar says at least he's alive
Yet evidence proves otherwise

Exhale, crawl in, into desire you're colored with
Entrust, forgive, to find comfort in your skin
