Interlocked, insatiable, unraveled and untwined
All that i have left is what i wish i'd left behind
With ignorance ignored i threw it all away
If only you believed there's more than just today

Longing for those never met
Fallen to a fear far crueler than regret

Through thick layers you will find a way
And punish me for the things i didn't say
A slow beginning ending start with honest intensions
Much colder today find comfort in suspension

To think that i believed
When you walked without conviction

Longing for those never met
Fallen to a fear far crueler than regret

Pierce through stolen velvet
Spare me the last ounce of viciousness
All i have are reasons
To hold to the purity in this
