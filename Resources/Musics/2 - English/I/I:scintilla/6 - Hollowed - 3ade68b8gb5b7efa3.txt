HOLLOWED

Seduce me, abuse me, make your mark
Demigod followed by your trail of ants
Your role and soul – can’t tell ‘em apart
Enter centered decadence

Crush stunted chrysalis

Your kiss, choke, heat, makes them fall to your feet
Without weight of concern you float through the street
Shallow dead kiss like a stagnant pool swallowed
Worshipped selfish lover leaving them hollowed

Self-portraits hung in your darkroom heart
Acid bath drip drowns empathy
Reflection, perfection can’t tell ‘em apart
Plastic cast, shape love into your needs

Echo as voice alone

You want them all to get you off get, get you off
Fake it for a little thrill, get your fill
Smile crushed porcelain and gloss, thick emboss
Cover up your city kills, petty thrills
