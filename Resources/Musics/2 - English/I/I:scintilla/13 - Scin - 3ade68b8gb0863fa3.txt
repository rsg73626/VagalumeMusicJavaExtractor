SCIN

Uncover the veiled shadows
Let it seep throughout embrace the state
Light through darkness still shines through
Purely easier to let complicate
Revive a dormant spirit
Spill over darkened shades
Under quickness awakened
This balance will never fade

Detach from crippling divisions
Feel outside your skin
Find empowerment and illumination
Taken entirely from within

Amplified in crouching low light
Experience grounds outside yourself
Stand up embrace this night
It still shelters assembled stars
What comes from the source of light
And all that is opposing
Scratches in and breaks down
The torn theme of self-loathing

How much deeper can this reach
Guess it all depends on the source of light
Revive, awaken but we give in tonight
