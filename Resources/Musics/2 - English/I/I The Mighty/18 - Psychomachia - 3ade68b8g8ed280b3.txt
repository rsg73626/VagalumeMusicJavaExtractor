PSYCHOMACHIA

Have you ever heard that voice of reason
whisper in your ear?
Oh did it say the things you never want to hear?
Tell me, where'd that angel perched
upon your shoulder go?
Did you pick her up and swallow her whole?
And do you ever miss the balance of the back and forth
Or is it peaceful now without the extra noise?
Tell me, where'd that devil perched
upon on your shoulder go?
Did it make your head its home?

Wouldn't you love to be inspired?
Let the thought erode your fears
Is it enough to be admired?
Does it get you through the years?

Stay calm. You've got to carry on
Oh, even with the weight of all you've done
How does it feel to know they look up to you
'Cause they're all so young?
And that's why the charges come
I wanna know, how many memories do you pray to forget?
Tell me, were they worth it?

Wouldn't you love to be inspired?
Let the thought erode your fears
Is it enough to be admired?
Does it get you through the years?
Well, I can't wait to watch your empire crumble
Can't wait to watch the walls cave in
For only when all you have is rubble
Can you truly build again

If you spend all of your time feeling you're empty inside
Then you should question everything you know about
If you spend all of your time ignoring every sign
Then you should question how you'll ever make it out
Hey, give me a reason not to cause some unrest
Tell the press, stop your checks till you're homeless
Hey, give me a reason you're entitled to this
I'll bet you question how you'll ever

And the levy's 'bout to break!
Yeah, you let the discord build
'Til you're sick from the static
And the devil in your head will yell
Careful, better be careful what you wish for
Careful, better be careful what you wish
Wouldn't you love to be inspired?
Let the thought erode your fears
Is it enough to be admired?
Does it get you through the years?

Well, I can't wait to watch your empire crumble
Can't wait to watch the walls cave in
For only when all you have is rubble
Can you truly build again
Careful, better be careful what you wish for
Careful, better be careful what you wish
