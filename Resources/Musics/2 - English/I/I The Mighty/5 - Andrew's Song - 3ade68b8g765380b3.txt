ANDREW'S SONG

You always told me to write a song about andrew
Little did you know that it would be about you
And I think he knows I won't see him come monday
When we meet up again to tie our own noose
His head at rest on my shoulder
In that place you used to call your nook
Where I'd let you stay till sleep stole you from your book

But now we're on our own
I'm only missing you so much
I lose control of where my
Thoughts go till you're someone I don't know
And the worst part of all of this
Is the way you claim to regret the day that we met
I'd never trade the years of love that we spent

But now we're on our own
I'm only missing you so much
I lose control of where my thoughts
Go till you're someone I don't know
I'm only missing you so much
I lose control of where my thoughts
Go till you're someone I don't know

I guess that's just how it goes sometimes
You fall in, you fall out, then wonder
If you'll ever even get a reply
I'm sorry lately that I never loved you
Better, even though we shouldn't be together
I'll always hate myself for not having self control

So now we're on our own
I'm only missing you so much
I lose control of where my thoughts
Go till you're someone I don't know
I'm only missing you so much
I lose control of where my thoughts
Go till you're someone I don't know
