101

Take the coast, 101.
It's longer but there's sun and water to make me feel like 
I'm getting better
And fill the void that's on fire.

Oh my god so in deep with this!
My only friend is a shit plant,
Can't wait to spark it on the front lawn of her new boys house.
Ha, I can't stop this laughter.

Knees lock to the steering wheel.
Fingers twist paper, lick and seal.
One last match, so I strike.
Text an ex, "Can we meet up tonight?"

Oh my god so in deep with this!
My only friend is a shit plant,
Can't wait to spark it on the front lawn of her new boys house.
I can't stop this - Ha Ha Ha!

Why can't you see what life's about?
Took twenty years to figure out.
I'm not the type to explain myself.
Still we both know, you were nothing special?
Just another page in my burn book.
Oh, I keep telling myself you were nothing special.
(Well that's a lie)
You said goodbye and my earth shook.
Oh, but there's so many things, there's so many things
I should have said?
But I never said it.
