STREETLIGHTS ON

All the remains of tonight's events 
will scatter into the streetlights and pass the time
Waiting for the sun to rise and take them away.
And with the elegance that you possess
you challenge my confidence
And I can't bare to move in for the kiss.
Our dilated eyes make it clear to me the dark 
can be a lonely thing.
Thank god for a star infested sky to light.

But I've just got one thing left.
I've just got one thing left.
Before you turn and bid goodnight, all 
I wanted was to tell you everything.

So here we are back at the start.
Just a step from your porch but not quite out of the yard.
You're playing a little game called hard to get and 
I've got to admit
That I kind of like it.
Yeah, I'm game for the chase.

But I've just got one thing left.
I've just got one thing left.
Before you turn and bid goodnight, all 
I wanted was to tell you everything.

Don't go inside! stay please.
Don't go inside.
