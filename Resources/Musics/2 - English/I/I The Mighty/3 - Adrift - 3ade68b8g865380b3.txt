ADRIFT

It's such a gift and a curse, how small we've made the earth
So many people to know, yet we know them all worse
How many moments you've missed in a room full of friends
Just staring down at that screen. Yeah, I'm guilty of all of it

I will give it up when I've had enough
I will give it up when we all, we all are one
Enough, when the rhetoric is done
I will give it up when we all, we all

Some billion people of the earth, all fighting over dirt
I'll trade my land for some bloodshed
How much are you worth?
Some billion people of the earth, all fighting over church
Looking for answers to questions of such little importance

I will give it up when I've had enough
I will give it up when we all, we all are one
Enough, when the rhetoric is done
I will give it up when we all, we all are one
Merely dust adrift in circles 'round the sun
You say you'll see your God when you're dead
Wouldn't it be worth it to try and find him here instead?
(He's in your head)

I will give it up when I've had enough
I will give it up when we all, we all are one
Enough. When the rhetoric is love
I will give it up when we all, we all are one
So when your heart's without a home
We all, we all are one
You know there's somewhere you belong
We all, we all are one
