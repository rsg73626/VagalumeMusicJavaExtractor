THE DREAMER

Hey lucid dreamer make up your mind caught on the other side
You feel the world stop spinning just before you see the light
Knowing you'll wake in your empty room, 
you dream for the one you swoon
But dark clouds are arriving the sun will be rising soon

And that's just the problem
The silence before the storm
Can't you feel the earthquake comin' on?

You wake to find that she doesn't even know you're alive
You saw your eyes shut open up
'Cause there's no way that you can wake up until you tell her so

You know it's not the real world, 
you can't imagine what her touch could be
Back when the hour glass was full, 
thought you could float upon a different breeze
But now that wind is starting to blow not in your control
And it's almost dawn, can't you feel the earthquake comin' on?

You wake to find that she doesn't even know you're alive
You saw your eyes shut open up
'Cause there's no way that you can wake up until you tell her so
Until you tell her so

So you curse at the sun to give into your love 
like a switch that can be turned on
Like you sleep with a plug in your back 
sure enough there's a point it will come undone
Well you're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone (Not alone)
You're not alone (Not alone)

'Cause she sleeps in fear of another year that 
you keep averting your eyes
You don't have a clue that she stares at you cause 
you busy dreaming a lie
A lie, a lie, a lie

You can't wake up because you live this lie 
that she doesn't even know you're alive

You saw your eyes shut open up
'Cause there's no way that you can wake up until you, 
you have to, you have to tell her so
