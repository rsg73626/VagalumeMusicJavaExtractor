SLOW DANCING FOREVER

Last night I had the most vivid of dreams
Emily came through my window and she hugged me
I felt every hair of my neck stand up
Every inch of her cold to the touch
She told me to miss the flight for her funeral
Sobbing into my chest, begging me not to go
I awoke teary-eyed but all alone

If I had listened to her
I'd surely still have my body and soul together
If I had listened to her
(It's alright, no don't cry, I missed you so)
If I had listened to her
I would have lived out a life looking for answers
If I had listened to her

I convinced myself that it was in my head
Got dressed, my hair done, but still a mess
Felt her hand on my shoulder as I locked the door
Felt her tug on my coat just as I got on board
20, 000 Feet, felt the wing break
Heard the captain's voice shake as he prayed
I just smiled, said: "baby I'm on my way. "
Now we don't have to wait

If I had listened to her
I'd surely still have my body and soul together
If I had listened to her
(It's alright, no don't cry, I missed you so)
If I had listened to her, we wouldn't be slow dancing forever
Forever with her
