THE QUICK FIX

We are just an investment
We are some elaborate plan
We are just an investment
A pawn for whom they call the man

Each of us a fragment
Forming but a single piece
Functional and overbearing
Beautiful, but, underneath

We beg for it
We scream for it
A love to manifest
And spread to the rest

Oh, we claim America as bliss
But beneath the skin we're in love with the quick fix
Oh, the world is too much to digest
Naive like a child, we're in love by the first kiss

Fear or faith has always been a part of me
But I know better than to trust a few men with guns (run! Run!)
Or a carefully worded document
I know I'm not the only one

Who begs for it
We scream for it

Oh, we claim America as bliss
But beneath the skin we're in love with the quick fix
Oh, the world is too much to digest
Naive like a child, we're in love by the first kiss

If (if) if (if) everyone loved (loved) loved (loved) just a little more
If (if) if (if) everyone loved (loved) loved (loved) just a little more

We beg for it
We scream for it
A love to manifest and spread to the rest

Oh, we claim America as bliss
But beneath the skin we're in love with the quick fix
Oh, the world is too much to digest
Naive like a child, we're in love by the first kiss

Turn on
Tune in
Turn off
Drop out
