HIDING FROM THE SUN

With respiratory responses, 
I'll bridge the gap from one breath to the next.
Let me sink.
I'll find oxygen unnecessary. my lungs, 
they no longer need the air from way up there.
I'll find peace amongst these sunken ships and bones 
that kissed away their prior skins.
They could not adapt.
The potent hit of salt has lost its sting inside my chest 
and with this breath I am home.

And though its neurotic to run from a cancer born love,
The undulating blue will keep my mind from thoughts of you.
As I'm hiding from the sun.

The moon has put the sun to sleep as 
I rise to the surface to attain my night on the town.
My feet will touch dry land again as 
I break down and sink into the sand, underground.
But here their eyes all read resent and I dig my way back up
Before they get the chance to waste a drug.
Oh, but the city lights are much to bright 
and my eyes they paralyze and dilate to compensate.

And though its neurotic to run from a cancer born love,
The undulating blue will keep my mind from thoughts of you.
As I'm hiding from the sun.

I can't live in-between, I must choose an extreme.
A years worth of metaphors couldn't find a meaning.
I'll invite the infection through skin cells and chromosomes,
Bones that grow hallow no marrow to decompose.
I suppose, I suppose I can never grow old.

But these pirates and sunken ships, they're alive 
once the day is dead.
And they don't forget, they don't forget, they don't forget,
And one says to me: "my friend, 
re-invent what you thought was dead, because we have our fun."
Yeah, we had our fun as I was hiding from the sun.
