JUST DRIVE

Well I've got some pills that I'm taking,
But I'm to see just how far I can go on my own.
And I wanna know if you're leaving because this evening 
I'll be far from home.
Make the way past half moon bay
And I'll let you know when we stop to stretch our legs 
and fill up the tank.
We're on the search for something 
more than we even knew we were looking for.
So please, would you lead the way.

That's right. just drive.
I need nothing more than a ride.
Lets take time and waste it.
Eyes on the horizon and lets see if we beat the sun,
'fore it breaks through and blinds.

This plot needs a twist. some dramatics.
Pull the chord from the wall and hit eject.
Make this car flip a bitch.
And tear up, tear up that map.
Oh, we don't need that, no we don't need anything.
Spare the money for gas.

That's right. just drive.
I need nothing more than a ride.
Lets take time and waste it.
Eyes on the horizon and lets see if we beat the sun,
'fore it breaks through and blinds.

Stay if you will, but I'm gonna run.
I'm gonna run for the hills.
Take, take these pills and hide them away in the hills.
Oh, this is my stop. it's where I get off.
I'll see you boys at home.
I just think I need a day to be totally lost and totally scared.

?take me home?
