THE HOUND AND THE FOX

No sleep for the sick! Been stayin' up too late
Draining out the chemicals, trying not to make mistakes
Little do they know that any given day
I'll expose all their hypocrisies
Express my inner rage

Oh tell me this
If you can say it to the public
Why can't you say that shit to your kids?
Don't act like money's not the factor
You're an actor
And it would blow everybody's mind
If they could see just what lies
Behind the velvet curtain, the office door
I'll give them no choice. I'll give them no choice

I can't catch my breath! Been working to the bone
Dottin' on all the "I's" and crossin' every "t" I own
This ain't pullin' thread... No, baby this is war!
I'll be the cog to end their cash machine
They'll rue the day the hound came to their door
The real crooks ain't wearin' ski masks
No, they're walkin' around in suits
They feed us lies in american wrapping
They're just acting

And it would blow everybody's mind
(I wish it didn't have to come to this)
If they could see just what lies behind
(I wish I didn't have to make a mess)
The velvet curtain, the office door
(But I've got no choice)
I'll give them no choice
I'll give them no choice

And it would blow everybody's mind
(I wish it didn't have to come to this)
If they could see just what lies behind
(I wish I didn't have to make a mess)
The velvet curtain, the office door

(But I've got no choice)
I'll give them no choice
I'm gonna blow everybody's mind
When they all see just what lies behind
The velvet curtain, the office door
I'll give them no choice
I've got my voice
