PLAYING CATCH WITH 22

I've been thinking back to when we
Used to share a drink on midnight walks
When you'd pretend your winter breath
Was cigarette smoke in your lungs
I'd fight the urge to give you all the
Worst advice about the ones you liked
(You called it chemistry, I called it earning bragging rights)
Knowing damn well if I told you how I felt, I'd crack the ice
Roll the dice

You're just a second away from being in love or alone
What you don't know, is that each second
You waste is a breath you don't take
It's a moment you wasted
I've been thinking back to that night on
Your front step when I held you as you wept
We sat awhile in silence but I was screaming in my head
How to tell you, if I should
What to say, if I even could
And if that moment came, would it simply hang forever

So I always try to live vicariously through my friends
(You call it chemistry, I call it perfect timing instead)
Watching all them fall in love, and wondering if I will again
You're just a second away from being in love or alone
What you don't know, is that each second you waste
Is a breath you don't take. It's a moment you wasted

You're playing catch with 22
For once it's out you've got to choose
But if you choose to hold it in
Then where's the chance to begin new love?
Who knows, maybe she's the one
I bet there's so many more than just the one for all of us

You're just a second away from being in love or alone
What you don't know, is that each second you
Waste is a breath you don't take. It's a moment you wasted
Just falling asleep with you
is enough to keep me hanging on
Whether or not we ever evolve
If all that we are is paint on a wall, waiting to peel off
Then poison the well and pour me a cup
Drink up!
