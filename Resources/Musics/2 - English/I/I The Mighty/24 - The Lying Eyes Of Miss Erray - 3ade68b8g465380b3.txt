THE LYING EYES OF MISS ERRAY

Seems like you already know
I'd love to have your name and a moment alone
You whisper that you'd have no other way
So I take you by your waist and head for the door
But then you stop and look me up and down as if to say
"Boy you better prepare yourself
for your legs are gonna shake. "
And I was all but clay within your hands
You had me line and sinker, hopeless in romance

I felt your current pull me under, but you held your hand out
Now you're the only one who knows my future
Lift me up, or let me drown
Miss erray, you won't get the best of me
You drop them a line, they take the bait
And I will not make that same mistake
Oh miss erray, you know just how to make me stay
When I finally get ahead, I fall right back in your bed

Is that really how you make it up to me?
With a little more fire, a little more love between the sheets
(Hey! Hey!) well, I will never be the sad
And lonesome creep who gets off from the awkward
Pause that only break up sex can bring
Just one more to remember
And one more just for fun
Baby give me one more for forever
So I can fill this filthy void until the next one

Miss erray, you won't get the best of me
You drop them a line, they take the bait
And I will not make that same mistake
Oh miss erray, you know just how to make me stay
When I finally get ahead, I fall right back in your bed
You play the game so well, but what's your game

Plan when time spoils those goods you sell?
Miss erray, you've gotten the best of me
But I am not afraid to take back all that you took from me
Oh miss erray, you can no longer make me stay
'Cause I've found myself again, a new place to lay my head
So how you gonna make it up to me? (hey! Hey!)
