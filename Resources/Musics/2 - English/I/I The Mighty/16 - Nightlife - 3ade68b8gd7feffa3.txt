NIGHTLIFE

All along the western plains the lions 
lick their teeth with a look in their eyes.
The one you're giving me tonight.
And all along the country side the morning doves will call.
For the sun will soon come and wake them all
With a brand new start.
A world apart from us.

But each time you drop a line it seems 
you're lying through your teeth.
Stop wasting all my time.
I've only got an hour to kill, lets not waste it all with talking.
We've only got tonight.

All along the new york strip the people wait 
and watch for the change of the light.
These little rest stops from their lives.
All along suburban streets the kids come out to play
And take advantage of the fact that there's no rain today.
But how different things become 
when night's the only time of day you're up.

But each time you drop a line it seems 
you're lying through your teeth.
Stop wasting all my time.
I've only got an hour to kill, lets not waste it all with talking.
We've only got tonight.

Just stop.
Stop blaming all your flaws on god and acting 
bashful when we both know you're not.
You act surprised when you look up at the clock. "oh it's so late!"
?like you forgot?
Just stop.
Stop playing like you care so much when 
you know neither of us care to keep in touch.
You're just like me, life's got you jaded on love.
Oh, we both don't care enough.
