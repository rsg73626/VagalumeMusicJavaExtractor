KILLER

Say goodnight. Go to sleep. Close your eyes. Shut them tight.
And don't fret about the man with the knife.
It's a joke. It's a lie. He's a fake.
Just a plague of the memories that keep you awake.
But if you let your subconscious bleed into reality 
he'll be hunting you down in your dreams.
So just relax. Breathe deep.
Let your mind drift you off to sleep and I'll see if 
I can keep the blade away.

But maybe he could stay?
And if you close your eyes he'll be gone by day break, anyway.
Maybe he could stay?
And as you sleep he'll steal all your dreams away, anyway.

Love and death are the two things that he is most aware of.
Singing songs of heartbreak and homicide.
And you'd thing that he would cry
But his tear well has turned stone dry.
And if you could have seen the way his life was lived to this date 
and time
Then maybe you'd understand his violent state of mind.

But maybe he could stay?
And if you close your eyes he'll be gone by day break, anyway.
Maybe he could stay?
And as you sleep he'll steal all your dreams away, anyway.

He's watching. He's waiting. He's planning.

All he wanted was one last kiss he said, 
"Shoot me so I leave this world alive."
Just a killer with one last wish he said, 
"Shoot me so I leave this world alive."
