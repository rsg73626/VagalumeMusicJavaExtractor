ESCALATORS

Floating down escalators
Your eyes are green, your heart is black
You've done some ugly things, 
now it's too late to take them back
Just money mongers here who never filled their karma cups
Now death has brought them here, and this room in hell 
is filling up

From town to town he came
To build his wealth he bought them out
Just build the biggest one, then all the smaller ones come down
We live the golden age 1909, 1909
Much money to be made monopolize, monopolize

Woah oh, oh you're so
Deserving of the place you're in
Escalating down in rows
Woah oh, oh you're soul
Was conscious of the path you chose
Here's proof that somebody knows

On a wooden stage he speaks
Eloquently about his feast, he swayed a simple folk
But in the middle of his speech
A none position screams "A man of one! A man of one!"
His threat was well received and so he hung and so he hung

And now it's all verse one it's all verse one
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Woah oh, oh you're so
Deserving of the place you're in
Escalating down in rows
Woah oh, oh you're soul
Was conscious of the path you chose
Here's proof that somebody knows

And you can call, oh brother call
Yes, you can call, oh brother call
No one can hear you, not at all
But you can call, oh brother call

And you can call, oh brother call
(Floating down escalators, 
you're eyes are green you're heart is black)
Yes, you can call, oh brother call
(You've done some ugly things, 
now it's too late to take them back)
No one can hear you, not at all
(Just money mongers here, who never filled their karma cups)
But you can call, oh brother call
(Now death has brought them here, 
and this room in hell is filling up)

We give you death by forty-five
It's what we call your last time out, your last time out
By forty-five, it's what we call your last time out

Woah oh, oh you're so
Deserving of the place you're in
Escalating down in rows
Woah oh, oh you're soul
Was conscious of the path you chose
Here's proof that somebody knows

We give you death by forty-five
It's what we call your last time out, your last time out
By forty-five, it's what we call your last time out, 
your last time out
