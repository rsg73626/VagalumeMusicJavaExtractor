LOVE YOUR SIN

We shouldn't bother at all
Now you're in too deep
I never told you to fall
Now it feels so cheap
But if I make the call for this to end
Then I'd never get to feel the way your skin feels on my skin

Will you take my hand and bring me back to the way it
Burned the first day we lit the match?

I love your sin, but I hate the taste
It's so good, but it's all a waste
I let it go, I let it go
I can tell that you bite your tongue
So close, but it's not enough
I let it go, I let it go

Let it go!
Well I've been combing the depths of my own head but never seem to reach the floor
My thoughts caught in the cut of your dress and the rest, so what's left?
There's no ink in the pen, it's dry in the river and there's only whiskey in the well
But I'm still gonna drink
That's my confession and if you wanna share with me I swear I'll never tell

Will you take my hand and bring me back to summers of falling asleep with my dreams intact
You play pretend, I'll lead you on
We'll fake it and choose to say nothing at all

I love your sin, but I hate the taste
It's so good, but it's all a waste
I let it go. I let it go
I can tell that you bite your tongue
It's so close, but it's not enough
I let it go, I let it go

(Give in, give in)
I knew I would it's too God damn good
Father! Save me! Make me clean again!

I was told your word was golden but I don't feel any richer
Tape my mouth, make me silent
Listening only makes me sicker

I love your sin, but I hate the taste
It's so good, but it's all a waste
I let it go, I let it go
It's so sick how you bite your tongue!
Closed lips lead to dying lungs
So let it go, so let it go
Just let it go!
