(NO) FAITH IN FATE

Lay with me as the sun creeps through the trees
Maybe as the day recedes
We can find what we've been missing
I thought it was the beginning
With all of the grinning and sinning

That we were committing only to giving
And living in this new found bliss
But all at once it was shattered and none of it mattered
I gathered the pieces and tried to pick out the pattern
To figure out just why you turned from my kiss
If it isn't real enough, then give it up, don't lock it down
(Fake love, you can't fake love)
If it isn't real enough, then give it up and turn around
I give up
Forgive, forget, then begin to reconstruct

I thought it was the beginning with
All of the grinning and sinning
That we were committing only to giving
And living in this new found bliss
I thought I could make it all better by writing a letter
But never decided whether us tethered together
Was ever what we both really wanted from this

If it isn't real enough, then give it up don't lock it down
(Fake love, you can't fake love)
If it isn't real enough, then give it up and turn around
If it isn't real enough, it's not love lost, it was never found
(Fake love, you can't fake love)
If it isn't real enough, then why make up just to wait around
Maybe I'm just meant to be alone and this is the world telling me so
Used to have some faith in fate, now it's something I can't shake
Tell me is it true that thing they say: Good things come to those who wait
But while I'm collecting dust, all the good ones get swept up

Maybe I'm just meant to be alone
Maybe I'm just meant to be alone
Maybe I'm just meant to be alone
(If it isn't real enough, then give it up and turn around)
Maybe I'm just meant to be alone
Maybe I'm just meant to be alone
(If it isn't real enough, then give it up and turn around)
Maybe I'm just meant to be alone
