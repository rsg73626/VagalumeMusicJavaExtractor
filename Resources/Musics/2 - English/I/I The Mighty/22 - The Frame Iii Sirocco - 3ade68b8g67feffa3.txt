THE FRAME III SIROCCO

When it's so damn hot,
They say you only see what you want.
Well, trust them not.
There's no one here to argue this mirage when hope is all you got.
'Cause now they're closing in as you begin to fall apart.

When everybody grew so cold,
You gave up but we believed in you.
And you were once this empty shell,
Now you stand above the rest.

Yeah, I took you in,
Told you of the storm that's coming
And I watched your eyes light up like fireflies in the desert night.
And you said:
"Yes, my friend they're hunting me down like a dog?
So I'll have them die like one."

Now they're closing in, as you begin your plan and run.
Run! Run! Run!

When everybody grew so cold,
You gave up but we believed in you.
And you were once this empty shell,
Now you stand above the rest.

You led them from where you call home
And into a desert storm.
And left them to deal with God.
In the morning they'd all be gone.

When everybody grew so cold,
You gave up but we believed in you.
And you were once this empty shell,
Now you stand above the rest?

But they already took her from us?
