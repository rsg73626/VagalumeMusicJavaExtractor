BROKEN DREAMS

We are the new blood
I will never change
Stop whining cause you won't survive
Now it's too late, beg for mercy
This is who I am
All hail to the king

What did you say to me?
I heard it loud and clear
You are the curse in me
But my revenge is near
What did you say to me?
Get on your knees and pray
Fuck your faith, feel my rage
I spit into your face

I was lost and no one cared
I crossed the line
You taught me, a small
Step can change everything
(I crossed the line)
Time's fading away, slowly and deeply
Close your eyes and pray for all the broken dreams

I'm standing here with all your voices
While I'm ripping the heart out of my chest
We won't back down anymore
Rise your fist for God's sake
Stay right here and fight with me
This battle won't be lost
Keep praying
I hope your motherfucking games will end in tragedy

I was lost and no one cared
I crossed the line
God saved me, back
When my time was counting down
I was lost and no one cared
I crossed the line
You taught me, a small step can change everything
(I crossed the line)
Time's fading away, slowly and deeply
Take my hand, I'll show you a whole new world
Time's fading away, slowly and deeply
Close your eyes and pray for all the broken dreams
