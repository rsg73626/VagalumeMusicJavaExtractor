SPRING BREAKERS

We live for this moment bitch

Let's get this party started
Fill all your drinks up
We are the ones who drink the shots
Until the last one drops

You want it? Just say it!
Tequila - for the ladies
Fuck off!
Go get out way
All the haters make us famous

Wake me up inside
What the fuck are your problems?
Wake me up inside
We go hard till the morning light

This one is dedicated to
All my fucking homies
Turn up the volume and
Shake your ass to the music baby

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me!
Suck my dick bitch
All I want is a shot

Drink that shit up!

Drink that shit up!
Cunt!
Let me show you my way
Get down!

Wake me up inside
What the fuck are your problems?
Wake me up inside
We go hard till the morning light

Your life is going nowhere
So just enjoy this feeling tonight
It ends tonight
I won't come back again tonight
It ends tonight

Wake me up inside
What the fuck are your problems?
Wake me up inside
We go hard till the morning light

Your life is going nowhere
So just enjoy this feeling tonight
It ends tonight
I won't come back again tonight
It ends tonight
