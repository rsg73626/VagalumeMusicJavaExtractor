LET ME GO

I can feel my heart inside you
Take my hands to the lights
And show me gently the path to heaven
You can never be yourself again
Can you feel the pain
I always fought night and day?
Everywhere you hear me whispering softly
Let me go

I did believe in what I see
My world falls apart
Can you change my fate?
You turned your back
When I drowned in the waves
How dare you cry on my parade?

Can someone revive me
From the nightmare I cannot escape?
I can't feel my heart inside you
Take my hands to the lights
And show me gently the path to heaven
You can never be yourself again

Can you feel the pain
I always fought night and day?
Everywhere you hear me whispering softly
Let me go
This is my demise
Life is running out of my veins
I can't feel anything inside me
With my heart in your hands
I say farewell to myself today

Take my hands to the lights
And show me gently the path to heaven
You can never be yourself again
Can you feel the pain
I always fought night and day?
Everywhere you hear me whispering softly
Let me go
