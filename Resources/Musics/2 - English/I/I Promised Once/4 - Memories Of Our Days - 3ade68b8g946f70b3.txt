MEMORIES OF OUR DAYS

The memories of our days still live in me
Can we go back to the time
When I was still a part of you?
Can we go back?
She points the gun to my head
I can't escape my fate
Never say never
Never say never
I won't give upon you ever

When the world collapses tonight
I want to be there for you
And I hope you believe me
Until the end
How can I change your mind?
I want you to see
The truth from its real side
Don't be afraid

I should have realized this coming long ago
I feel so hopeless
It's over
It's over
Can't you see that you're my everything?
You took my breath away and now
I'm still trapped in past

When the world collapses tonight
I want to be there for you
And I hope you believe me
Until the end
How can I change your mind?
I want you to see
The truth from its real side
Don't be afraid

I see my life pass in my mind
I could have been
I should have been
Can you forgive my sins?
My dear, forgive me
When the world collapses tonight
I want to be there for you
And I hope you believe me
Until the end

How can I change your mind?
I want you to see
The truth from its real side
Don't be afraid
