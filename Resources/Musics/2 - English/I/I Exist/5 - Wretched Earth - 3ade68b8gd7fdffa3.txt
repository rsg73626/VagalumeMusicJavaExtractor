WRETCHED EARTH

Life unenjoyable passing and wasting such precious time.
Greed, found a weakness in me when 
I sampled tee taste of divine. 
Traded my cosmic distant paradise 
For a chance at repairing the world.
I was looking for pleasure 
And only found pain in the hell broken earth.
I was sold.
Turn to the mountain becoming a smoldering lava pit.
There you may flee from the cruelty, immersing yourself into it.
My power. My greed.
Destroyed the world.
But I tried to take another path.
Follow the way of the lord.
Battled creatures that tower 
My height from the desert to the shores.
Wielded blade til my fingers ache
From the dawn through the night
Served this land more than any man, 
this place will never see light.
