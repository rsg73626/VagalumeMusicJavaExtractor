ELEMENT

I will miss you will be missed stepping into transcendence
Apart from this intricate heart I know
Tell me this will distance determine our strength in love and
What is the power pulling us please let me know

Come on break free from this element
Come on tell me that you've gone far away
I will see you again
But will I know

Right when you step by my side
Until then tell me this will distance determine our strength in love and
What is the power pulling us please let me know
Come on break free from this element
Come on tell me that you've gone far away
