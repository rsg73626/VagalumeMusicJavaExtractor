UNITY

I'll never stop
Using my senses
"True to my heart"
That's what your text said
Have you read through mine
As many times?

I may never know
What you are thinking
What you really want
Or what you are needing
But maybe for a moment
You'll see

I want you
I want you to know me
I want the light from my heart
To open up your eyes
Is it showing?
I want you
I want you to

Wake up
Hear this
Echo within the night

I'll never stop
Following voices
Dancing in the dark
Electric noises
Do you feel the same
While spinning in circles?

Life never stops
You're always moving
Motion of the blur
And I keep tuning
But if we slow down
Could we see through this
Divided world
And find unity?

I want you
I want you to know me
I want the light from my heart
To open up your eyes
Is it showing?
I want you
I want you to know me
I want you to see through myself
And see yourself look back
Through the glowing

I'm waiting
Within these words
To be understand
And to be heard
I'm waiting
With patience
Toradiate all the love
And the world that I see

I want you
(I want you)
I want you to know me
(To know me)
I want the light from my heart
To open up your eyes
Is it showing?
(Is it showing?)
I want you
(I want you)
I want you to know me
(To know me)
I want you to see through myself
And see yourself look back
Through the glowing
