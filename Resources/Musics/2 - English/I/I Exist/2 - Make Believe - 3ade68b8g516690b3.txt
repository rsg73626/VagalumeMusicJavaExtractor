MAKE BELIEVE

They are
Trying so hard
To break down parts
Of our first thoughts

And turn them to dust
I know that they are
It seems that we must
Take hold and clutch
The remedy

But don't fall
For this one
You brain-dead victim
Don't fall
For this one
Don't wash away
What makes you, you
You are someone
Yet so afraid

I don't believe
We need a prescription
To feel or to think
On our own
Lets make believe
Without the permission
Imagine a nation
And let it grow

Create
Bake and feed
The things that we need
They make believe there's a problem

We
Afford these treats
Without thinking
They plant the seeds
And we water 'em

But don't fall
For this one
You simon says victim
Don't fall
For this one
Don't wash away what makes you, you
You are someone
Yet so afraid
Define or fail
Remind yourself
Define or fail yourself

I don't believe
We need a prescription
To feel or to think
On our own
Lets make believe
Without the permission
Imagine a nation
And let it grow
