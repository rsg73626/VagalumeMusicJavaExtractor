OUT OF BODY

Magnify the ray and multiply
The words to say from a cocoon
To fly away the wings they grew
To turn from gray it's up to you

And into me

My one and only out of body
Up to you and into everything I see
It's into me

Fantasize the life you knew surprise
Will keep renew this changing life
Is not for you it's in the sky
Far in the blue it's up to you

And into me

My one and only out of body
Up to you and into everything I see
It's into me
