THE BEGINNING

This table used to hold a "dinner",
This house used to home a "family", not anymore.
Those days have come and gone... looking back now 
I don't remember much.
I spent my whole life trying to prove my worth (I had no place),
I was sheltered from this world, I lost all hope, there was no god...
I can only "thank you", you made me who I am today, 
I've faced my fears,
I've become a better man but my heart's still bitter.
I can only "thank you", you made me who I am.
This table used to hold a dinner,
This house used to home a family, not anymore.
Those days have come and gone...
