FALSE PROPHET

I am not a king, you're not a prophet.
I hear all these words you speak, why don't you steal their soul?
My bodies breaking, from the hearts you've choked.
Now I'm left contemplating 
all the things you said when you inspired me.
Do you remember me?
Place your face on the edge of the throne, 
you'll never speak again.
Place my hands beneath your soul, you'll never speak again.
I was just like them, you'll never speak again.
I am not a king, you're not a prophet.
I believe that there's a king a throne 
out there and we will see his face one
Of these days.
Do you see what you're doing?
You're taking hopes and dreams from these kids.
You'll never speak again, I was just like them.
You'll never speak again because I am not taking this anymore.
I am not a king, you're not a prophet.
I believe that there's a king a throne 
out there and we will see his face one
Of these days.
Your time will come if you don't wake up.
When everyone and everything is gone, where will you be?
Your time will come, if you don't wake up.
