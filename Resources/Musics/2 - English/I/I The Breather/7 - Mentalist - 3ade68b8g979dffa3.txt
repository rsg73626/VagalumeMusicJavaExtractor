MENTALIST

Can we take on the weight of the world?
This corrupt world... I know we fell short many times before,
We can't do this all on our own.
Our generation takes the task, 
wake up we've got to pick up the slack.
Our generation takes the task.
We will rise up, put on the armor of god.
If we shy away, how can we create change?

Fight for the one we believe in, our generation takes the task.
I'm not fighting with myself anymore,
No longer wrestling with flesh and blood.
Never stray from our faith, this is our call to duty,
It's our destiny, the strong will triumph, 

we'll make strong the weak.
I'm not fighting with myself anymore...,
If we shy away, how can we create change?
Fight for the one we believe in, our generation takes the task.
We will rise up, put on the armor of god.
If we shy away, how can we create change?
Fight for the one we believe in, our generation takes the task.
