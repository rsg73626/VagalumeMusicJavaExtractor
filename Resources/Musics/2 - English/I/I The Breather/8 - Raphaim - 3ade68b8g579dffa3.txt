RAPHAIM

We stand here like we're all alone 
and there's no one else out there.
We have come to believe,
We are the one land. so selfish to think
We are the only ones. no one knows, we are not god.
We are scared to find the truth so we shy away,
We dismiss the things that are different than our beliefs.

I want to be free and not judged for what I believe.
I want to stand up tall, I want to help who falls.
There's no right in fighting our own.
We are scared to find the truth so we shy away,
We dismiss the things that are different than our beliefs.
We are trying to be something we are not, we are not god.

Stop judging and open your eyes, 
our souls have the same beauty inside...
No two minds will ever think alike.
So who's wrong if we don't know who's right?
But we fight with fire inside.
I want to be free and not judged for what I believe.
I want to stand up tall, I want to help who falls.
There's no right in fighting our own.
