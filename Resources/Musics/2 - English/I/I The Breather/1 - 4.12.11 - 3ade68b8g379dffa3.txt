4.12.11

We close our eyes
As the day turns to night
We forget what it's like to sleep

The memories again sink in
When they were by our side
Every day and night

We're begging to you asking you why
You took the closest thing to our life
Is it me?
I can't seem to think
Why must we suffer
Why must we suffer

I'm begging you, please
I'm begging you to tell me why

I've faded away
I've faded away
I've faded away
I've faded away

And I fear I'm not coming back
And I fear I'm not coming back
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
But we still wish they are coming back
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust

If we are just a cancer
Please tell me what we live for
What's the meaning of our life?

Are you with me on this? God!
Why won't you tell me you're with me on this?
Why won't you please just reach down

I've been praying and praying to you
Just to come and take away the pain

God, where are you?
Because it's been one year
I forget what it's like to sleep

The memories sink in
When you were by my side
Every day and night

I'm begging to you asking you why
You took the closest thing to my life
