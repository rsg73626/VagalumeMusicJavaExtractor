KNIGHTS & PAWNS

We all found love in the wrong places,
We're all living lies in our heads.
Living in silence has taught me everything I know,
We're all knights and pawns forced to fit the mold.
This is such a sad world. our hands 
are calloused and we've got nothing to
Show.
We're living in a perfect world that we made into a sad, sad world.
We're all living lies in our heads. we're all stuck. 
we're stuck in misery.
We're fabricated.
We're all living lies in our heads. 
I must admit that I feel a sense of
Rejuvenation to know there's no relation 
between my irrational fears
And what's in store for us.
We're all sinners bathing in our own self pity.
This is such a perfect world that we made into a sad, sad world.
