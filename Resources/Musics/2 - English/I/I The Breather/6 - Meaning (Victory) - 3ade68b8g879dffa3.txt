MEANING (VICTORY)

Bracing open my eyes with a heart full of fear,
This life fades with every blood, sweat and tear.
When will we fall?
When will our existence crumble?
When will we crumble?
You spend your whole life looking 
for the basic meaning of this world and so
Much more.
Searching for a home full of love and a life 
that many dying dreamed of...
I'm screaming to you with a soul full of grief,
Father they are preaching with a snake 
at their teeth and it repeats, it
Repeats.
Oh this is me, I know this is me, you say 
I'm not worthy of this life we speak?
Oh this is me, I know this is me, 
I just can't follow all these lies you
Preach.
You call yourself a man of god?
You can wear it but can you defend it?
I'm trying to get closer but the waves keeps smashing my fate.
Now how I am supposed to follow to this life 
with the world crumbling at the
Edge of my feet?
I'm screaming to you with a soul full of grief.
Father they are preaching with a snake 
at their teeth and it repeats, it
Repeats.
You spend your whole life looking 
for the basic meaning of this world and so
Much more,
Searching for a home full of love and a life 
that many dying dreamed of...
