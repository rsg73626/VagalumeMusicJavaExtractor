JUDGMENT

You got what you wanted. 
a heart full of pride and a soul full of pain.
My actions speak louder than my words.
I'm so fed up, I'm so sick and tired...
I am not like them.
I am not the same.
I am not the one who gave you your beliefs,
I am not the one who stripped you of your dreams... 
so who's to blame?
I am the same as you, we're raised in a world that's black and blue,
I have got a heart and a soul. so who's to blame?
We are the same, I've got a heart and a soul that guide my way.
That does not make me any less than you.
I am the same as you.
I am not the one who gave you your beliefs,
I am not the one who stripped you of your dreams.
Why must I be pushed off for what I believe?
This is not right.
This is not the right time or the right place.
We saw god. I know you don't believe this beauty in this life I lead.
