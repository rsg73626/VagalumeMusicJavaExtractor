BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO LEAVE

I don't know why I came in the first place It seemed o.k. back then but now I just don't know
appearances deceive This town is a pretty town to leave Oh home sweet home, is what it never was
to me, Looking for the exit 'cause now I know appearances deceive, This town is a pretty town to
leave Everyday I wonder Can I leave? I wonder Why am I here? Everyday I'm planning My escape I'm
running Running away Away Headed for the first bus out of town
