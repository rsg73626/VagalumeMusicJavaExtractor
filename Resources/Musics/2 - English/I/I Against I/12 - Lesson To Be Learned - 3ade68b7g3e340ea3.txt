LESSON TO BE LEARNED

i guess i'm really not that smart 'cause if i was i would have seen it all form the start. you kept repeating "i'm in love." you just never said that it's not me you were thinking of. but now you're gone and i feel bad 'cause you didn't care about me. love is something we never had 'cause you never cared about me.... and there's al lesson that i've learned. play with fire and you'll get burned.... i guess i'm really not that bright 'cause if i was i would have seen you'd changes overnight. you came to me all nice and sweet. and i was dumb enough to throw myself at your feet. but now you're gone i feel betrayed 'cause you didn't care about me. thinking of all the games you played 'cause you never cared about me. and you'll get burned like i got burned. i guess i'm really not that smart 'cause if i was i would have seen it all from the start.... and now you're gone and i feel relieved 'cause you didn't care about me. i can't believe i ever grieved 'cause you never cared about me.
