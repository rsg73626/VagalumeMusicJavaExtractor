ALL BY YOURSELF

i know you're waiting for so long, waiting for a sign. a sign that someone cares about you. but life is hard the way we live, putting each other down. killing people in our minds.... we gotta hide it all, we gotta hide it in our lives... and every day you went to school scared to be the one, the one they shall terrorize. standing in this world all by yourself. it's you and only you. all alone you will survive. you've done it all by yourself.
