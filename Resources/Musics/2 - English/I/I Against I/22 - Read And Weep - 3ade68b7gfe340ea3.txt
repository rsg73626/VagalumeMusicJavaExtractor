READ AND WEEP

Those words on the shelf Not giving me any help at all Disguised as my guide Won't lead me anywhere
Dictate what to feel They're trying to make it all look real As if I don't know What you're trying
to do Every page That I'm turning It's my face that will turn with it Couldn't stand me The bare
sight of me Cause I'm living the opposite First page 'til the last The art of  brainwashing at it's
best Try to hypnotize They want me paralyzed The life that's portrayed The styles that they want
me to embrace They're out of this world Have to get them out of my face Page one Not a description
of me Page two It's someone else that I see Page three I will not read this and weep I'm choosing
my own direction I will write my own damn manifest Page four  Hypnotized Page five Paralyzed Page
six - Idolized
