THE BOTTOM

sitting all curled up inside, the only place where i can hide. where i can hide. i'll just put up a fake smile, that ought to fool them for a while. why should they know? they don't know who i am, still they think i'm crazy. i think of what i done 'til now, the perfect way to bring me down. to bring me down. i'm scared to fail so i don't try. i let my chances pass me by.... the bottom's fallen out and i think i'm crazy. i don't know what i'm about. i don't know and i'm crazy.... i should be my, but who will that be? i don't know what i'm about, i don't know and i'm crazy. and i'm crazy.
