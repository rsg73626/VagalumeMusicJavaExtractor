GLOOM

Climbing the hill of disillusion
Suffering the pain of this journey
All the sorrow flows into the valley
And from high I contemplate...

I fade reminding that vengeance is an empty cup 
While the nectar's taste vanishes away from my lips
The betrayer soul that guides me until here
Now disappears, hides from me...

I search, already tired, for the amulet
That will bring me back home, but 
Enfeebled I numb, and forget that the end
Becomes dimmer as the time passes
