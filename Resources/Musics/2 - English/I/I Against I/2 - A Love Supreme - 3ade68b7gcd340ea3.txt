A LOVE SUPREME

You've done me wrong and I would bleed If I watched you If I could watch you bleed as well Feel so
stupid for my state of mind Cause my mind knows I still love what I hate And I know that I'm
wasting my time here on you Yeah I know that I'm wasting my time hating you How I wish you hadn't
stabbed me But you did It'll come back at you Yeah you really hurt me so bad You'll be sorry Cause
I will make you feel my pain Still I know that I'm wasting my time hating you Yeah I know that I'm
wasting my time here on you I'll break you like you broke me That is all I've got to do I realize
I'm wasting time I can't help wanting you You've done me wrong and now I'm bleeding Man I'm
bleeding And it doesn't change a thing I can't think straight when I'm near you Cause I fear you
And I won't be scared no more Now I know that I'm wasting my time here on you All I know is I'm
hating my time hating you
