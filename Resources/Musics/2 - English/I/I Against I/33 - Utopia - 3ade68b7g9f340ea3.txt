UTOPIA

i was only twelve years old when i started having dreams about playing in a band without hypocrisy. but as i'm older now i've come to realize that playing in a band is not utopia so here is my advice. you gotta try real hard to get rid of them. of all these old-fashioned ideas you been having about this music. you gotta try real hard to get out of this, out of this hypocrite scene 'cause there's nothing you van do about it. one day i was old enough to realize my dreams. i could not know that music isn't what it seems. but as i'm older now i've come to realise that playing in a band is not utopia so here is my advice.
