REASONS

When his heart breaks free
When his mind turns to his home
When a moment is all
When he feels all the world

When the heart is free
Doesn’t matter sun or rain
Because the storm is over
In the night he flies away
Trying to catch the meaning
Yeah, life is worth it...

Listen to him
Even everything lost sense
Even so life is worth it
Even without reasons
Have you found yours?
Have you found yourself?

When his heart breaks free
He doesn’t need any gods
No prisons, no chains
What he loves
He lets it go
Sets it free...

"I feel complete when I go out
To hear the conscience made by men
To release other feelings that are also mine
To have a drink, a good conversation
I learn to live without false shelters
Closer to people I learn much more"

Listen to him
Even everything lost sense
Even so life is worth it
Even without reasons
Have you found yours?
Have you found yourself?
