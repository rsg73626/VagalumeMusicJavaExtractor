TOP OF THE WORLD

where can i go for a warm place tonight? where can i go for a safe place to hide? i hope it's close to you 'cause you're the only girl. the one that makes me feel like i'm on top of the world. and you'll never hear it anyway, but i'd like to say to you.... can't you see that i like you? can't you see that i want you? i cannot touch you, you'll never be my side.... where can you for a warm place tonight? where can you for a safe place to hide? i know that's close to me, but i'm not the only guy who sits here waiting for you, as you keep passing by. and you'll never hear it anyway, but i'd like to say to you... when you're close to me, i don't know what to say. i feel so insecure, you can't take it away.
