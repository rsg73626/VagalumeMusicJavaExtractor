PASSED ME BY

i'm 21 my life has just begun. but already i'm in pain. i feel like i'm insane. i don't know how i could express myself. the words are hard to find. i cannot clear my mind.... each night i sit at home. i cannot find an explanation. what is it about me that is making me stay alone?.... every day i think about how it could be. with somebody to hold. so i wouldn't feel so cold. is there no one to share my feelings with? 'cause i've got a lot to share. but no one seems to care. there was a time when i felt alive. somehow those good times have passed me by.
