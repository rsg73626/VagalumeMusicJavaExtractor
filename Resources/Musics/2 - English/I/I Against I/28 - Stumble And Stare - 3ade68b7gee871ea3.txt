STUMBLE AND STARE

i'd rather not see you 'cause i'd like to see you again. i'd rather not see you 'cause you'd see the geek i am. i wish that i knew you, i don't. i just wanna hold you, i won't. i'm just afraid you'll say no! before you go. when your eyes catch me i stumble and stare at the floor. i wanna talk to you, instead i walk right out the door. i wish i was braver, i'm not. i wish i could give all i've got. i'm just afraid you'll say no! before you go. i wish i could call you, but you would hang up. i wanna talk to you, but you'd say "shut up!" there must be some way to let you know i don't want you to go.
