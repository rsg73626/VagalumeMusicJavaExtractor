NOTHING HAPPENED

Well for a moment it was over then I don't think that it's over, now Now we can go on this way
Like nothing happened; nothing changed a bit But I wouldn't bet my life on it The feeling just
won't go away Leave me alone There's nothing wrong You wouldn't listen then Well fuck you I won't
tell you now If there is anything you feel Listen to what it tells you It won't hurt a bit to kneel
There was a time when I was easy 'cause Now I'm acting on my worst I know that I have you to
thank You never listened to a word I said And I just don't feel sorry now That it's you who has to
pay Fuck you I just won't tell you I spent a lifetime on you But now I'm back where I belong
