ONLY ALPHABET

Don't want to be searching anymore Tried so hard, forgot what I'm looking for Who'll rewind Who'll
remind me what the search was for Talk so fast I can't keep up Tried so hard, forgot who I was Who
am I Who are you and what the hell is true?! Only alphabet, only alphabet Everything that I don't
say will tell you who I show myself in all the things I don't do Opinions forced upon me brutally
Tomorrow's mistake is the truth today, you see Leave me be I need to be alone with my own thoughts
You may think you are number one, but So do I; that's a song been sung A million times Or even more
even more and more Know your lines; recite them in your head Repeat them on and on and once more
after that Know your lines, repeat them in your head Again again again, they're only alphabet
Don't want to be searching anymore Tried so hard forgot what I'm looking for Who'll rewind Who'll
remind me; can't search anymore I show myself in all the things that I don't do Everything that I
don't say will tell you who
