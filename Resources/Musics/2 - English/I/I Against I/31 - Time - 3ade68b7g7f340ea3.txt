TIME

time is a difficult thing. you can get lost for years and then don't know where you've been. and when you are 81, you are wondering where the years that you have passed have gone.... is that really why there's time around us? is that really all there is around us? isn't there another option for us to create a dimension?... time will be over soon 'cause the life that i live will be over around noon. i don't keep myself in health. so when others grow 100, i will be dead at 10. time is a difficult thing. you can get lost for years and then don't know where you have been.
