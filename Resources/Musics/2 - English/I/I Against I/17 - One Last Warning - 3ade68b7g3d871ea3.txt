ONE LAST WARNING

There will be no pacification I won't tune in to your station I'm gonna take out all that is inside
Try to stop what I am doing In spite of warnings you're pursuing This has been your last call,
can't kill my voice You're out of here Didn't come on invitation There will be no pacification I'm
gonna fight the doubt that lives inside Try to stop what I am doing In spite of warnings you're
pursuing This has been your last call can't kill my voice I won't be dragged in there It won't be
my freewill Put up a fence around my brain I won't be the next to bow down to your fucking plans
This is all there is, this warning was the last It's all there is, the last stone that I'll cast
There will be no pacification So you can save your revelations My mind won't be switched off, can't
kill my plans Try to make me think like you do When I know that I've been lied to You're never
ever going to succeed You'll never kill it Not my freewill So listen closely This is your last call
One last
