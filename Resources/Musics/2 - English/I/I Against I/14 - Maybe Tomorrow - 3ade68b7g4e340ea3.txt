MAYBE TOMORROW

Maybe today i will finally find
The handful of words that bring peace of mind
'Cause yesterday left me with nothing at all
I can't change a thing i'm feeling so small...

[Chorus]
But as i'm waiting, i'm winning my chances are passing me by
And as i'm waiting, i'm losing the spirit to get up and try
Another day ends and i sit around by myself thinking "Life doesn't rhyme.
Maybe tomorrow won't be here in time....

Maybe today they are finally said
The handful of words that will clean my head
'Cause yesterday left me with nothing at all
I don't know a thing i'm feeling so small...

[Repeat Chorus]

But i'm still waiting
Yeah i'm still waiting
Do you felt like waiting all this time?

But i'm still waiting
Yeah i'm still waiting
Do you felt like waiting all this time?

[Repeat Chorus]

Maybe tomorrow won't be here in time...[x3]
Maybe tomorrow!
