NAILED TO THE FLOOR

i can remember the struggles i knew. the person i could alway count on was you. i took it for granted, i guess you did too. you thought i was your friend, yuo thought it was true. but then came the time you needed my help. and i was too scared i only cared for myself... i can't help you. you gotta try to get on by yourself. i won't help you. is friendship the one thing we never had? i can't help it. i won't help you... i thought i knew now it seems i was wrong. when it came down to it i wasn't that strong. when you called my name i stood nailed to the floor. i thought i knew now i don't anymore. 'cause there came a time that you needed my help. and i was too scared, i only cared for myself.
