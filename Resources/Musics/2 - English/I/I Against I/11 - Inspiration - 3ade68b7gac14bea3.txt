INSPIRATION

In the darkness
Runs my soul
Searching for light
And everything that it has
The nature is the source
Of all my inspiration

I feel the meaning of my life
has just died
My soul at last found itself
But I can’t find peace
I can’t find peace

I’m so sad
With the world
My depression walks
And I lose sense

I feel the meaning of my life
has just died
My soul at last found itself
But I can’t find peace
I can’t find peace
