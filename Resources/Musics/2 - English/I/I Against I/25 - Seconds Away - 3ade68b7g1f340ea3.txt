SECONDS AWAY

Stood on the edge I was watching down Refused to fall and hit the ground Seconds away: a zone free
from pain But I turned away, didn't know That it's me who draws the line I'm the tyrant in my mind
And I'm gonna try if that is all That I can do This is a two-way street I'm in the middle I'm
looking for a quick way out But apathy won't get me out of this It won't get me out of here You'll
never know You'll never know if you don't try it Stopped turning away I looked on my head Silence
was louder than a bomb The parts wouldn't fit They never would I held my breath, didn't know I'm
the tyrant in my mind Yeah, it's me who draws the line And I'm gonna try 'cause that is all that I
can do Tried hard enough this time So glad it worked 'Cause I was never down Fooled myself around
I drew the line Yeah it was me this time I left the two-way street Changed my directions Now I
found the way out Apathy would not do it for me Never did a thing for me And you'll never know
You'll never know if you don't try it  Never know if you don't try it
