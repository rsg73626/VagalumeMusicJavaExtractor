LOOK INSIDE

why don't you take a look at yourself? stop acting like you don't need help. 'cause you have got your failures too. so look inside of you. a lot of people dont' know themselves. because they never have been through hell. so ask this question if you think you're wise. "am i not what i despise?" ....a lot of people just don't see that what they hate they'll come to be. and now you may feel better because you laugh about them. but they will laugh harder in the end... hypocrisy, irony and hate. a big part of what runs this state. though hate is the most powerful one. don't use it just to have fun. we've all got problems of our own. don't fuck around you'll be left alone. that's what integrity is all about. and hypocrisy's not allowed. why don't i take a look at myself? stop acting like i don't need help. 'cause i have got my failures too. but look inside of you.
