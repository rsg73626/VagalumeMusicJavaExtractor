CATHERINE

I almost lost it, nearly got me run over
I was writing a song for you
I walk into walls, and Lord I've had some hard falls
Tell me this what love's supposed to do 

Chorus

It's a funny situation for such a great mind as mine
No concentration I'm never anywhere on time
Aw Catherine, I'm losing it, it's really not hard to see
Movie Queens and dirty dreams just don't do nothing for me
When I get back home I'm gonna disconnect the phone
I'm gonna show you what I can do
I'll break all the rules they teach in ivy league schools
In just a minute alone with you 

Chorus
