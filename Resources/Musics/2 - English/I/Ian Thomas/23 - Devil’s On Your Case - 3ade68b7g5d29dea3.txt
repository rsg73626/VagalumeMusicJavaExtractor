DEVILâ€™S ON YOUR CASE

You don't answer my calls so I'm writing you a letter
The grapevine has it that you're drinking far too much
Heard the doctor dropped by, looked into your eye
Said, "Baby Baby you trying to die,
You're so darned stoned that I think you're losing touch" 

Chorus

Well you're losing everything
Devil's on your case, look out you'll fall
Yeah you're losing everything
Blue in the face and still you don't hear me call
Calling you back, calling you
You don't hear me call, you don't hear at all
You're such a sinner, you look a little thinner than you used to be
Your wicked ways gonna wear you to the bone
You're out so late looking for a date, (maybe two or three)
It's da booze made you wicked, can't you leave dat stuff alone 

Chorus
