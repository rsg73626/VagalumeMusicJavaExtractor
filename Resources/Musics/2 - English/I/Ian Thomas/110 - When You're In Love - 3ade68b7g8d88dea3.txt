WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE

When you're in love you might try to explain
How you moved into a light that once was far away
Every soul needs to feel it
Every man, woman and child
You can know it for a lifetime or just hold it for awhile

When you're in love, you don't feel the pain
When you're in love, you will laugh again
When you're in love, someone to be with you
When you're in love, all of this is true
When you're in love

It could be forever or it could be just a day
You've got no way of knowing, no one can say
You might want to control it and you might make your demands
You might be the reason it slips right through those hands

But when you're in love, you don't feel the pain
When you're in love, you will laugh again
When you're in love. someone to be with you
When you're in love, all of this is true
When you're in love

There will be times you won't believe it
There will be times it's hard to find
There will be times you might want to leave it
Understand there are those times
Oh i understand there are those times
