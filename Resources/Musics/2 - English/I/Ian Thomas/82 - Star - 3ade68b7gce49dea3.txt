STAR

Rushing everywhere against the time
When all along, I've got nowhere to go
Trying to be a star, way up high
Looking down and making quite a show

Spending money every time I needed laughter
Small talk with some honey who's so irritating after
And all along you were right in front of me 

Chorus

C'mon sonny well you're gonna be a star
Make lots of money and retire
And when it's over you'll be looking from afar
Trying to forget the mire
Star... star

Reassuring smiles that seem so real
Lead me on into a fantasy
Everybody's trying to make a deal
On everything they can get out of me

Shaking hands and all the one night stands
The praise that always follows, seems to leave me feeling hollow
And all along you were right in front of me 

Chorus
