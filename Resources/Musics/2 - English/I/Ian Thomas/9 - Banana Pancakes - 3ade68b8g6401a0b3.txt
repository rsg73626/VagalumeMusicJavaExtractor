BANANA PANCAKES

Well can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But, baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Wakin' up to early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that its just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe, hala ka ukulele
Mama made a baby
Really don't mind to practice cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady, love me, cause I love to lay, here lazy
We could close the curtains pretend like theres no world
Outside
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that its just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Can't you see, can't you see?
Rain all day and I don't mind

But the telephones singin', ringin'
Its too early, don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow
Wake up slow

But, baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now
Then we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that its just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see?
You gotta wake up slow
