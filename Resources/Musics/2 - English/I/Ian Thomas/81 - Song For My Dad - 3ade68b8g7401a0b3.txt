SONG FOR MY DAD

Dear dad you and me
We're a weird lovestory
You were my big hero
Yesterday and tomorrow
Love at first sight
We'll be allright
We lived chasing dreams
It's in our genes

Most times you're my God
But sometimes you are not
Don't understand your ways
Though I'll just go the place

Daddy this song is for you
In all I do there's pieces of you
You can goyour own way
But please dad don't wander too far away

Now I want to know
Why can't you let go
Of shattered dreams you had
You will always be my dad
And as I grow older
I still need your shoulders
Tell me are you proud
When I sing out loud
Will you run through my veins
And understand my pains
Will you hold me thight
Kiss me good night

Daddy this song is for you
In all I do there's pieces of you
You can goyour own way
But please dad don't wander too far away
But please dad don't wander too far away
But please dad don't wander too far away
