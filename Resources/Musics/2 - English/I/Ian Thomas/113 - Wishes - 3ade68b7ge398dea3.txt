WISHES

I wish I was lying under a noon sun
I wish it was an island in the middle of nowhere
I wish I had the money for the realization
But I blew it in Vegas on the things you do there

Sometimes wishes, sometimes wishes
Sometimes wishes come true

I wish I could help somebody who hasn't got much
I wish I could do just, just this one thing
I wish I had the money, oh it wouldn't take much
But I blew it in Vegas on that Vegas thing

Sometimes wishes, sometimes wishes
Sometimes wishes come true

Oh I could win real big, I could save the world
I could get a car. Maybe I could get a girl
Then everybody would love me, call me friend with pride
They'd be after my money and I'd be trying to hide

I wish I didn't wish so much, I could be so happy
I wouldn't want to have what was not mine
But I'm thinking of my future (and you gotta)
And I could be so happy
So I'm off to Vegas one more time (with feeling)

Sometimes wishes, sometimes wishes
Sometimes wishes come true
