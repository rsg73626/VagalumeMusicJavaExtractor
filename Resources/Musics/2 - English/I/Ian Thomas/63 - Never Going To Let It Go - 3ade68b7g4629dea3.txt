NEVER GOING TO LET IT GO

Young kid living on the street in new york city
Looks a little strange, wants some change but he doesn't want your pity
He's on the make, you know he's never looking back
He's got some dream about a big cadillac

And he's never going to let it go, never going to let it go
He's never going to let it go
It's everything

An old man holds his woman, says she's still some kind of mystery
He's only loved her all his life. some can do this while some just get weary
Someone passing by might say she's a little past her prime
But he only sees this picture stuck inside his mind

And he's never going to let it go, never going to let it go
He's never going to let it go
It's everything

Some call a man a fool who lives inside a dream
Whose only prized possession is what is yet to be

And i'm never going to let it go, never going to let it go
I'm never going to let it go
It's everything
