THE GOOD LIFE

Well the morning's come and you're on the run, gotta keep the family fed
Last night's drinking kind of ruined your thinking and you're feeling light in the head
You don't know what's right, and you don't know what's wrong, and you're tired
Your arms are tight, throwing coal all day long on the fire 

Chorus

You wonder if you're living, 'cause you're always on the giving end
And nothing's ever coming in
You say you're deeper in debt the baby's always wet
Well you're living the good life
There's no reason there's no rhyme to why you never have time
To ever be alone with yourself
It's the breathing that's believing 'cause it lets you know
You're living the good life

Today you got paid and the woman said tonight you better come straight back home
Well you met all the boys, you had to make the choice after all they couldn't drink alone
Now you don't know what's right, and you don't know what's wrong and you're tired
There's a hole in your soul, 'cause the last lump of coal's on the fire 

Chorus
