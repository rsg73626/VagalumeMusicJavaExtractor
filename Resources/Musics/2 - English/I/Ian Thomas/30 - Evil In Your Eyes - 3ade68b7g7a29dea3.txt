EVIL IN YOUR EYES

There's something in the air about you
A feeling i just can't pin down
Don't you know my friends think i should live without you
Some think i should move along

It's the evil in your eyes
You're evil in disguise

You though when i went out for a coffee
That you just might be making time
Some fellas smiling at you pretty
You think you're doing really fine

It's the evil in your eyes
You're evil in disguise

I'll just run to the mountains and hide
I'm tired of eating my pride over you
You think i had nothing to do
