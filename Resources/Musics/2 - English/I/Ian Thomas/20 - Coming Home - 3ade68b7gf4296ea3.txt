COMING HOME

Night after night, another town, another hotel
Another road takes me farther away from you

Roadside cafe, I'm in need of a little conversation
But the waitress says she's had a hard day
So I'm on down the highway

I'm tired of being alone
And getting stoned to pass the time

I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home
I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home

Bad times I've recalled, over the years have slowly faded
For the life of me they're gone
The things that pushed me away from you

Maybe I've changed, or maybe time makes things look better
Ah it's all the same so I'm down the highway

I'm tired of being alone
And getting stoned to pass the time

I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home
I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home

I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home
I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home

I'm comin' home, I've been away too long
Been away so long, I'm coming home

Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahhh ahhh ahh ahhh ahhh
