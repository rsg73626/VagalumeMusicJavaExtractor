ROLL THE DICE

Some of us were born to make it
Some of us are going to succeed
Some will find their level of contentment
Some of us will always be in need

Some of us will always have lovers
Some of us will never be touched
Some will thrive on civilization
Some of us will want to blow it up

Everybody rolls the dice
Everybody wins a few
Tell me that my luck is right
Tell me that you want me
Like I want you

I sit here waiting for an answer
I re-arrange the letters in your name
I'm looking at them every which way I can
But they only say one thing

They say some of us were born to make it
They say some of us are going to succeed
They say some will find their level of contentment
Only some of us, some of us, only some of us

You just keep trying harder when you lose
'Til a seven or eleven looks at you
