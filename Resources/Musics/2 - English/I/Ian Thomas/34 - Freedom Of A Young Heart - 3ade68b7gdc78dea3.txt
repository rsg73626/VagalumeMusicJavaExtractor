FREEDOM OF A YOUNG HEART

I used to be so starry eyed
There was nothing that I couldn't do
Only saw the brighter side
Only doing what I wanted to
So many hearts to be lost and won
Setting my sights between the moon and the sun

Chorus

That was the freedom of a young heart
That was the freedom not knowing
That was the freedom of a young heart
That was

Taking things as they come
Keeping pretty much to myself
Never should have let you in
The simple life went all to hell
I guess I'd be better off alone
Don't want to be a stepping stone

Chorus
