THE RUNNER

Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you, another runner is born
Don't look back, you've been there
Feel the mist as your breath hits the air
And it's underneath the moonlight
Passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight
Like a drum

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
To pass on the flame

Sun come up, sun go down
Hear the feet, see the sweat on the ground
Watch your step, keep your cool
Though you can't see what's in front of you
And it's underneath the moonlight
Passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight
Like a drum

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
To pass on the flame

Cause you're a runner in a race
Taking someone's place who's run
You're a runner in a race
And the only way it's won
Is to pass on the flame

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
To pass on the flame
(Pass on the flame)
To pass on the flame
(Pass on the flame)
