WHEN I NEED SOMEONE

This is a good life, though it's only one time
Stumble or fall
We can only make the most of it all
Hey it's a good life
So glad I met you on the way
Confused and blind
'Til the day you came along

Chorus:

You know how to listen to me
When I need someone to talk to
You know how to love me
When I need someone to get closer to
You never let me down
When I need someone to talk to
You're always around
When I need someone to get closer to

Must be a lonely life
For those who stare at four walls
Footsteps in the hall that pass the door
Still it's the only life
And there are blind men who see
Less fortunate than me
Come back for more

How long can they carry on
Somehow they do
And soon they are through another day
It's a long road and a heavy load
And I'm so glad I've had some help along the way
