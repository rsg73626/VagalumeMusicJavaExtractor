ANOTHER

Keeping just me away from where you've been hiding
I was up all last night stoking the fire
Holding a light to the window to see you
See you come through the dark and open my door

You were supposed to meet me over a day ago
Seems like a year ago when I last saw you
When I first saw you and you looked at me
I know you could see that my heart was on fire

I can tell you love another
Another loves you the way you love another
I need a shoulder to cry on

Keeping your things the way they were when you left them
Hoping to see you again soon someday
I keep persisting that you never left me
Opened the door and then walked away
