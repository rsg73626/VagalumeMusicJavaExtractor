Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah

Don't let the bastards get ya down
Turn it around with another round
There's a party at the bar everybody
Put your glasses up and I drink to that

Got a drink on my mind and my mind on my money, yeah

Got my ray-bans on and I'm feelin' hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody's vibin' so don't nobody start a fight, yeah-ah-ah-ah

Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don't let the bastards get ya down
Turn it around with another round
There's a party at the bar everybody
Put your glasses up and I drink to that
