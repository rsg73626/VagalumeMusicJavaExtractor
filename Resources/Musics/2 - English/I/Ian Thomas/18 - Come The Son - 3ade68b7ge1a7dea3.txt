COME THE SON

Come the day we were walking into town
To see the man who came to move the world again
He looked so fine, sun was shining on his head
People stared and then a silence took the air

Come the son
We were feeling pretty high
Come the rain
Can't you feel the bleeding pain
Oo that was long ago now
Oo can't you feel the pain no more

The day he died we were feeling pretty bad
Saw no tears, we knew that he'd be coming back
To the land of his brothers home to find
People changed with a new found peace of mind
