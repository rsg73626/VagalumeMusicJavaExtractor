IT'S OVER

All the music's been played, all the words have been said
Sad it's over
All my friends have gone home but their laughter hangs on
When it's over

I'm sittin' in my easy chair and watching dancing shadows
Smelling cigarettes and stale beer and hearing haunting echoes

Ah everything is done
Ah and now the morning comes

So when i'm old and blind i hope i still have got my mind
And all its memories
So when there's nothin doing i can sit for hours chewing
On my memories

I'll be sitting in my easy chair and watching dancing shadows
Smelling cigarettes and stale beer and hearing haunting echoes

Ah everything is done
Ah and now the morning comes
