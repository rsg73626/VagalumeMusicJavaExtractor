LEVITY

Empty eyes and they are such lonely ones
Under city lights, you feel you're the only one
That's left alive, up and down the empty streets
No stars in your sky, nothing's where it used to be

Oh put some levity back into this life
Take the disillusion away
Put away the things that go bump in the night
That pull you under

Though It's denied, there's a lock on the embassy door
Inside, those who forgot what they went there for
Like a star with no sky waiting for a time and place
Or a poet run dry, no words for his line and space

Put some levity back into this life
