ONE OF THOSE DAYS

I had a feeling it was one of those days
It didn't amaze me, should have stayed in my bed
I couldn't see and tell you just what i saw
No good at all nothing i do comes out any more

Is there nothing i can do
Is there nothing i can say
Is there nothing that will clear my head
And make me sane again

I just fell down the stairs and out the back door
Feel pretty sore, should have stayed in my bed
I ripped my jeans and blew a hole in my shoe
So nothing's new
Nothing i do comes out anyway
