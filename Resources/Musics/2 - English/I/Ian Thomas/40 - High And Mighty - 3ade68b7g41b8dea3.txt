HIGH AND MIGHTY

There's a desert being eaten by a city
Dried up rivers, barren mines, that cry for pity
'Cause they've outlived their need

Somewhere a hangar looms that's been so carefully hidden
Once found the people tried, but entrance was forbidden
'Cause they've outlived their need

Only the High and Mighty, only the High and Mighty
Only the High and Mighty, will get away
Leaving the ones they lied to, leaving the ones they made love to
Leaving the ones they used to waste away
Only the High and Mighty

A blinding light flashed 'Glider' raced toward the heavens
A plotted line so many years in its conception
Known only to the few

Look where you place your trust in light of what's been told you
Beneath aspiring moral crust, the animal still holds you
Despite the dreams you dream

Only the High and Mighty will get away
Only the High and Mighty
