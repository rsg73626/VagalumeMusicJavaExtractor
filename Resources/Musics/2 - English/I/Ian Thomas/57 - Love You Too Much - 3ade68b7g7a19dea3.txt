LOVE YOU TOO MUCH

Well I could go and let you make a fool of yourself
But I love you too much
When you're being cruel to somebody else I try to cover it up
I could tell you, you look stupid when you're trying to be cool
But I love you too much
When you're drunk out of your mind and you're acting like a fool I try to cover it up

'Cause baby, I love you that much. I love you too much
When you dominate every conversation you're in
Enough is enough
When you argue for the sake of arguing
Enough is enough
If I saw these things in somebody else
I wouldn't like it too much
But in you I tolerate these things too well
I guess I love you that much

'Cause baby, I love you that much. I love you too much
And I love you so much I only want to remember the good stuff
And I love you so much I can never get enough, never get enough
And I love you so much I want some more of the good stuff

'Cause baby, I love you that much. I love you too much
