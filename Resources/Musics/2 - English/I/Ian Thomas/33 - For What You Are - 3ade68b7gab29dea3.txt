FOR WHAT YOU ARE

If you really want me
Then you want the way that I am
Not to try to change me
Oh, darling, I'd do the same for you

As a child I had a mother
She tried to make an angel of me
I don't need another
Oh, darling, I love you but something's wrong

If you want me, really want
Like I do really want you, really want
And I do really love you, really love you
For what you are


As a child I had a teacher and she would tell me
What I could do
And there was the preacher, and now my darling,
Now there's you
