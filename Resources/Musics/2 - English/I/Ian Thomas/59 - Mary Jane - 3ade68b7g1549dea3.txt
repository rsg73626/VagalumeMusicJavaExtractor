MARY JANE

It's been a year or so since anybody's seen her
Mary Jane was on her way from school
They say a big red car pulled up and she got in
The sheriff says it was after dinner that Mary's mother phoned in
Where's Mary Jane? My Mary Jane, oh, Mary Jane, Mary Jane

You know they ran her picture for a month or so
Saying, "Anybody seen Miss Mary Jane?"
Now there's nothing, seems like everyone's forgot
But Mary's folks who sit with the toys they bought
The toys they bought for Mary Jane

My Mary Jane, oh, Mary Jane, Mary Jane

I remember all the Sunday afternoons
Swinging on her swing and singing funny childrens'
Funny childrens' tunes, Mary-Jane
My Mary Jane, oh. Mary Jane, Mary Jane
