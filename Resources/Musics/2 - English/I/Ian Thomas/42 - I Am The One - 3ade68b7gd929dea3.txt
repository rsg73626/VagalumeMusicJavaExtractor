I AM THE ONE

I'm not concerned with what some people are saying
That doesn't matter, no that doesn't matter
When I don't hear from you, the tricks my mind keep playing
I wonder if I matter, I wonder if I matter

Ooo, you've been gone such a long time
Like a fool, I let you go
You left to find yourself an answer
Like a fool, I let you go

Chorus:

Lovers may come and they may go
But in the end you'll surely know
I am the one that you can count on
You can count on

I spend my time just sitting and thinking
Nothing seems to matter, nothing seems to matter
I lie around and wonder what you might be doing
Nothing seems to matter, nothing seems to matter
