ENDLESS EMOTION

You can take whatever you want, that I can give you
When I feel this endless emotion
I've got to shake some sense into myself, but logic
and reason just don't fit in this situation

I can't see out, I can't see in
I can't see anyway
I can't fix the fix, the fix I'm in
I've nothing to say

Chorus

It's just the way I feel
Endless emotion
You make me feel
You put my senses in motion

What I hear, so distant, see people speak
The words don't reach me
Some kind of strange atmospheric condition
What I see is moving so slow
That it escapes me
Don't let me slip fall into remission

I can't see out, I can't see in
I can't see anyway
I can't fix the fix, the fix I'm in
I've nothing to say

Chorus

When something belongs may it remain
Your love is all
Always to be always

Chorus
