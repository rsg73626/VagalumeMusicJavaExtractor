WHEN I GET LIKE THIS

I don't know what I want when I get like this
And I know I'm pushing my luck more than a little bit
I feel myself going to the wall
Over something that doesn't matter at all
I'm just sorry you had to see me when I get like this

Sometimes I push on the walls just to see where they are
Sometimes I'll take a position and I'll push it too far
I feel myself being unfair
Pushed by some unfinished business somewhere
I'm just sorry you had to see me when I get like this
I never wanted you to see me when I get like this

And when I get like this
I see the disappointment in your face
And when I get like this
You're here with me but I'm some other place
And when I get like this
It's another side of self that doesn't serve me well
I'm so sorry you had to see me when I get like this

There is an on going struggle and it gets out of hand
Between who I wish I was and who I really am
And who is the one you chose
And are you having second thoughts now you've got this close
I'm just sorry you had to see me when I get like this
I never wanted you to see me when I get like this
