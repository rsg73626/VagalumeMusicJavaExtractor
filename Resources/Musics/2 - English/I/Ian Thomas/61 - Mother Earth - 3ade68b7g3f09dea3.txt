MOTHER EARTH

Lookin' down on the bay, I see nothing fresh in the tide
It's all here to stay, all the crap is getting harder to hide
All the paint in the world ain't gonna make the sky blue
The way it's going, you'd never know we loved you
Loved you, oo, mother earth

Look at all of the air you can see it falling out of the sky
It doesn't seem fair, you used to look so good to my eye
And when you're crying, is anybody around
You're going under and none your friends can be found
