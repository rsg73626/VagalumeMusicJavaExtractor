DO YOU RIGHT

So you say you've learned your lesson
You've been through it all before
One romance after another, so now you close the door
No taking chances, this time you want to be sure
Well hey I'll do you right I'm feeling your resistance

Every time I cross the line
C'mon give me some assistance, don't keep it all inside
This times going to be different, you're only wasting time
Well hey, I'll do you right

Romance after romance but the distance was the same
No believers only players in the game
And you don't want to go through all that pain again
Hey, I'll do you right

Your successes have no meaning
When you've only got yourself
Never giving, just receiving, there' s no comfort in your wealth
Sooner or later you've got to lean on someone else
Well hey I'll do you right
