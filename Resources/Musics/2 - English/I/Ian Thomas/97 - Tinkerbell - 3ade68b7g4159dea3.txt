TINKERBELL

It seemed so late but it was only eight
When you came upon the screen
Life was so simple
You were so dear to me

What was late is early now
As insignificant as it seems
I can't turn it around
And 20 back where I've been

Tinkerbell where are you now
That I am growing old
We moved away and a piece of me
Was sold
I was just a child then something
Happened too quickly to tell
Will I ever find you
Tinkerbell

My mother went a year ago
My father was soon to follow
Now my brother and me
Are trying to fill the hollow

We remember when early was late
We remember you upon the screen
We remember when they
Wished us both sweet dreams
