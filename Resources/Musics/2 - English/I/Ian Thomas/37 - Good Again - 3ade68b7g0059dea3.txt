GOOD AGAIN

So this is life, sometimes it doesn't seem like much
But it is life nonetheless, and there is warmth to the touch
Oh you'll cry when some leave before their time
But you'll keep a little something that they left behind
And you will feel good again

Friends, so many friends walking on by
All through your life, like shadows in a shuffling line
You'll come across one you forgot every once in awhile
Time changed the face, but it didn't touch the smile
That makes you feel good again

Each and every moment floats away in the wind
Got to learn to let it go, let a new one begin
Oh you'll cry when some leave before their time
But if you need a little something, it s right there in your mind

And you will feel good again
