WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME

When I'm grey will you stay by my side
'Til darkness comes over my eyes
And when I'm sick will you lick my wounds over
And feed me with you loving smile

Ah will you still love me tomorrow
Or will you be changing your mind
Will you deceive me
Or will you believe that I'm loving you all of the time

If I should die just before I awaken
Will I see the light shine in your eyes
Have no fear please, I'll be here when you need me
To feed you with love all the while
