DELIGHT FROM DEMOON

Olive de people gathered into da meadow
Pondering what on de earth was making olive da shadows
Dafoot hung over defence, as day vaited
All de voices shut, and all de eyeball dilated 

Chorus

All day, all night, day vaited
Da voices shut, de eyeball dilated
For delight, delight from demoon

Rhubarb through de crowd, der was such a commotion
People with panic, udders knelt in davotion
What was deface in da sky dat kept blinking
A big boogie man or a hole in de ceiling 

Chorus
