ALL ABOUT HER

Run your fingers through the ashes
Smash the pictures on the wall
Just remember where the past is
Footsteps fading down the hall

Well I've been there before
And she was all I ever wanted, and I will pain no more

I know all about her, all about her

Put the head in the hand
Put the photograph away
Keep the foot from sinking sand
Believe nothing that she say
