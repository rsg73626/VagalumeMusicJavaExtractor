INSECURITY

I have got to get out of my mind
Every little thing I can find
That makes me unsure
Oh insecurity
Can't you leave me alone

I'm so tied up with you
In everything that I do
You're showing through
Oh insecurity
Can't you leave me alone

Nothing has changed
But nothing's the same
You re-arrange me
Until I can't tell you my name

Oh insecurity can't you leave me alone
Leave me alone insecurity
Let me go home
'Cause you're taking the best out of me
Leave me alone insecurity
Let me go home
'Cause you're making a mess out of me

So I must ask you to go
None of my feelings will show
'Cause there are often times I don't need you at all
If I'm changing my mind
You won't be hard to find
So if I need you then I will give you a call
