YOUR LOVE HEALS

You and I, we don't have to say a thing
Words can take you, only so far
It's in the eye, the way your body moves

When I am weary from the pain that I have seen
I can take it, only so long
A weakness in my defences where the world is getting in

And your love heals like a medicine
Your love heals what's troubling
Give me shelter from the storm
Your body keeps me warm and your love heals
