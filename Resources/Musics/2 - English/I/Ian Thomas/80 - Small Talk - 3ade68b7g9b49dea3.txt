SMALL TALK

Huddled in a hallway making secret mindless chatter
A finger that points at you and the giggles that come after
Spreading all the latest news, those Lilliputians
Find their strength in number

Walk towards a noisy room, deathly quiet when you enter
Look across those shallow eyes that turn and smuggly whisper
Wait your turn in line, but the teller
Shuts his wicket on your number

Had enough of this, small talk
The most useless information
Small talk, making worse my situation
In ignorance grows, way out of control
When you're the last to know

Mutated seeds that snowball down the biggest mountains
Contaminated water flowing from never ending fountains
And it's carried on by all the empty lives
Living someone else's

Had enough of this small talk
