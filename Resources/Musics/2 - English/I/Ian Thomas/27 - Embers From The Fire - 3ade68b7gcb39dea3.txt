EMBERS FROM THE FIRE

Along the way some dreams get shattered
Left behind they are pages faded and tattered
And they lay there on the road rained on
'til some unsuspecting soul comes along
'cause sooner or later, what gets lost gets found

Chorus:

They are embers from the fire
Waiting for a gentle breeze
Holding only one desire
That things just don't have to be
The way they are

What has slipped away long forgotten
Been misplaced for a time forsaken
But it tries to hang on as long as it can
'cause there has got to be some good in man
'cause sooner or later, what gets lost gets found
