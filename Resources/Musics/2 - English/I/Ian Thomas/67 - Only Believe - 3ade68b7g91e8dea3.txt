ONLY BELIEVE

I've been used, I've been sacrificed
I've been pulled in and walked all over once or twice
Once naive, is now this sceptical man
Do what he reach that's all he can

No shades of grey, I'll take black or white
There's nothing in between, it's either wrong or right
Shake it all up, somebody's got to pay
If what you said is what you meant to say

'Cause I only believe what I see I will believe
All the rest is only make believe
Give me something I can touch that I can feel
Promises get broken I need something real

They say a little pain, that's what everyone needs
What's little to someone else could be too much for me
Take it as it comes, like the sceptical man
Do what's in reach that's all you can

'Cause I only believe what I see
