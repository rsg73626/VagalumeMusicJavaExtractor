LET THE STONE ROLL

Oh the days are dropping like the rain
For the time, i feeling no pain
Will i be this same time next year
What i don't know, i surely cannot fear

Who understands if he has not seen
What's on the other side where you have not been
When you're talking to the spirits
Are you really talking to yourself
Or casting stones down a wishing well

Let the stone roll, what will be will be
Let the stone roll

Some get the money and some will get the blame
Who's really mad and who is really sane
I take advice when i should listen to myself
Or cast a stone down a wishing well

Trapped in the present tense no one sees through
What's up ahead is what you're moving to
Captured from the moment you began
Who will be the star who will be the fan

Let the stone roll, what will be will be
Let the stone roll
