YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW

You've got your share of problems
A kind of self inflicted hell
You come with so much baggage, I feel like a porter in your hotel

Well it could have been your childhood
Or some hope you couldn't live up to
Or maybe it's the stars or the moon in your sign
Or maybe it's just you

You gotta know this isn't working, you gotta know I can't relax
You gotta know I need some distance, I want you off of my back

You're into self improvement and there's so much to be gained
But you don't apply a single thing you learn
And then you wonder why you're still the same

And you don't have a clue what you sound like
Or how many people you hurt
You say you don't intend the messages you send
When you treat somebody like dirt

You gotta know this isn't working, you gotta know I can't relax
You gotta know I need some distance, I want you off of my back
I've gotta tell you this ain't working, in case you misunderstood
You'll be waving I'll be walking, my life should be so good

I'm sorry I've hurt your feelings with everything I've had to say
I could have done it behind your back in that civilized way
Maybe if someone had said something sooner
Instead of avoiding a scene
But then again people seldom change from everything they've been

You gotta know
