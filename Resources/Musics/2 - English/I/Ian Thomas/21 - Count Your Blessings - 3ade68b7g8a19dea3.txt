COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS

When you're sitting all alone and you say, "I've had the berries
Lord there's nothing in this world that's any good"
What you don't know is what you can't see
'Cause there's someone somewhere else, thinkin' just
What you're thinkin' to the tee

So you better count all your blessings
Even though things arc lookin' so bad
You just count all your blessings, soon you'll see
There's a rainbow on the horizon, there are people that you can count on
You just count all your blessings soon you'll see

When your shadow grows too large and you can't see through the darkness
Oh and things seem a real mess, it's all gone bad
Well you got ears that you can hear with, you got a nose to take you on home
So then don't get to feeling so sad

Chorus
