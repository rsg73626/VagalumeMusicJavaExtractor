WHAT LOVE CAN DO

It can make you feel weak while it makes you feel strong
It can make you stay up all night long
Can make you feel like a child, it can make you blind
And sometimes it isn't what you had in mind

You can try to act like you don't have the desire
You can try to use your mind to put out the fire
You can try self denial, you can try to hide
Like a holy man who gets something on the side

That's what love can do, that's what love can do
It can change the game in the middle of the rules
That's what love can do

You can find yourself saying terrible things
And in the next breath apologizing
It can ebb and flow it can boil or freeze
Or make you bite your tongue just to keep the peace

That's what love can do, that's what love can do
It can change the game in the middle of the rules
That's what love can do

It can take you up to the mountain top
It can push you to the point where you want to jump off
It can make you aspire to a higher plain
Or it can make you think that you're going insane

That's what love can do
