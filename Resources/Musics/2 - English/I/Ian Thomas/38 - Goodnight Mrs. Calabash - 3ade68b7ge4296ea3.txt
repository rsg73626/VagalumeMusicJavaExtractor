GOODNIGHT MRS. CALABASH

They're all alive, in old movies
See them, even though they're gone
Can you remember Jimmy Durante?
His eyes glisten in the lights
Mrs. Calabash, goodnight, wherever you are
You can't be gone, you can't be gone, well not on my T.V.

Time just stands still in old movies
Love them, even though they're gone
Jack Benny's 39
Bogart's doing time
Wallace Berry's just the same
Still bugging Marjorie Maine
Oh, Marjorie Maine
You can't be gone, you can't be gone
Well not on my T.V.

His eyes glisten in the lights
Mrs. Calabash, goodnight, wherever you are
You can't be gone, you can't be gone, well not on my T.V.

(Movies play in the background to end)
