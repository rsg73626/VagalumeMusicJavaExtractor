NERO'S SPELL

Nobody, want to work no more
But they still want the money
And they keep askin' for more

Pie in the sky, the American dream
24 hour TV and the fastest machine

Nero's Spell
We are the stupid people dancing
While the city burn to hell

Only the pictures will remain
The painters consumed by the insane
Old warnings hanging on buried walls
So the finder, may heed the call

Piled up people, on such a small piece of land
Pushin', shovin', tryin' to reach the feedin' hand

Too many cherry in a sack bulging at the seam
Crushed on the bottom they bleed where nobody

Nero's Spell
We are the stupid people dancing
While the city burn to hell
