THINGS I DIDN'T SAY

These things, I know I should have said
But for one reason or another I chose silence instead
Years after the fact, they're still a distraction
And saying anything now gives me no satisfaction

These things I didn't say, never go away
They stay in my head, the things I should have said
Nor will you ever know, I wish it wasn't so
So all you have instead are the things I should have said

I feel like a fool and the feeling goes on
When I think of what to say too late and the moment is gone
Yeah the moment is gone and it's got me in tow
Would these things I never said have made a difference
I'll never know

Please forgive me this crime of not speaking, not speaking my mind
