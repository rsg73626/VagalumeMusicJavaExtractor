RIDERS ON DARK HORSES

They are masters of deception
They'll catch you in their cause
They will give you misdirection
When you're lost

They thrive on hate and anger
It gives them reason to belong
So riders on dark horses
Carry on

You can feel them in a cold heart
You can see them in a fire
You can feel them when you're lying
You can see them in desire
They are shadows with our faces
But they don't have to be
Still riders on dark horses carry on
Riders on dark horses

A day will come for dreamers
When they leave it all behind
Belongings on their shoulders
Sailing for a time

When the mist uncovers mountains
When the ships have found the shore
When riders on dark horses
Are no more

You can feel them in a cold heart
You can see them in a fire
You can feel them when you're lying
You can see them in desire
They are shadows with our faces
But they don't have to be
Still riders on dark horses carry on
Riders on dark horses

You can feel them in a cold heart
You can feel them when you're lying
They are shadows with our faces
But they don't have to be
Still riders on dark horses carry on
Riders on dark horses
