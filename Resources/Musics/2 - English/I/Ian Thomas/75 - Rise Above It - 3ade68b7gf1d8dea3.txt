RISE ABOVE IT

My life runs so smooth. I'm never late
I feel obliged just to play it safe
I want to shake things up and find what's missing
I'm not alive, just making a living

And I want to rise above it. I want to rise above it

I want to feel like a reckless kid
Screw something up just to say I did
I'm paying for all of this stuff I don't really need
I could own it but right now it owns me

And I want to rise above it. Get rid of the weight
I want to rise above it. Get my life straight
I want to rise above it. I can't pretend
I want to rise above it all and be myself again

I took a walk down the path of least resistance
Took money from the man I'd been keeping at a distance
Then for the sake of position I ate my pride
'Til there was nothing left for me to compromise
I want to rise above it

Say this is me. Say this is what I am
Say take it or leave it. Make them understand
I can't be bought. I won't get caught on the run
I don't need this. I won't take that from anyone
I want to rise above it
