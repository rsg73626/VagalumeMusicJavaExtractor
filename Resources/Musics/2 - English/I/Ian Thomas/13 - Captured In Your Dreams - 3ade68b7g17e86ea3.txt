CAPTURED IN YOUR DREAMS

Close your eyes and all the things that you knew
Places you've been and faces you've seen
Will look right back at you
Memories behind you are much closer than they seem
All around you, all the time
They're captured in your dreams

Drift away until you're floating on a sea
Get to feeling dizzy
Feeling weak around the knees

Then when you look up and the world begins to lean
Say hello to everyone, who's captured in your dreams
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

And while you're there if it won't take you too long
Go back and do right what you know you've done all wrong

Drift away until you're floating on a sea
Get to feeling dizzy
Feeling weak around the knees

And while you're there if it won't take you very long
Go back and do right what you know you done all wrong

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oooh ooh ooh....
Ooh ooh ooh...
