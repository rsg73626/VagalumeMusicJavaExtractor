LIE TO ME

Sometimes i don't want to hear the truth
I want to lock it all away
And i'll try to find escape in you
And deal with all the crap another day

Forgive me if i seem shallow at times
Forgive me this need to make believe
But let's not get so serious if you don't mind
I need a little room to breathe

I know i'm asking you to dress up and it might get kind of strange

But come on lie to me tell me what isn't so
Lie to me tell me only what i want to know
Lie to me, don't cry to me
Won't you lie for me?

Now that wasn't so bad was it?
That wasn't so hard to do
We were just kind of getting the hang of it
And now i guess it's time for you

You need to know how good you look to me
Even in those moments when you don't
And you want me to speak like poetry
And just the right way or else you won't

This play might be different but the lines are just the same
You're saying "lie to me"

There's plenty of serious people in this world
Doing real serious things where they're at
Nose to the grindstone, eyebrows furled
No make believe just the facts

And when they see us laughing and acting kind of strange
They'll know you lie to me
