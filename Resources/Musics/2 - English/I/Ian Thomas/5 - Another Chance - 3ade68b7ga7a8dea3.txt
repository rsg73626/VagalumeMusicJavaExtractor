ANOTHER CHANCE

Life is going to move on without you
You gotta take every break in sight
When opportunities pass, you gotta think fast
Don't get left behind

You gotta make your move, you gotta make up your mind
You gotta listen to yourself, don't get left behind

Another chance passes by, passes by you
Another chance just walked by, right by you
Another chance passes by, and you let it go

Well there's no use in feeling sorry
We all make a few mistakes
But when you're watching the time going faster and faster
Everything look too far away
