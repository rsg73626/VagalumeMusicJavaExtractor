I REALLY LOVE YOU

You make me out a fool
You think I'm funny
The thing I'm trying so hard not to be

And when you say to call
You don't answer at all
You tell your friends it's only me

I......really love you
Tho' it goes nowhere
You're on a ferris wheel 
Ride drive me crazy
Tho' it brings you closer
It just takes you up again
Ride tho' it brings you closer
Ride till it takes you up again
Ride tho' it brings you closer
Ride till it takes you up again

I dream it's all a dream
I call your name
You turn around and seem to look at me
The ferris wheel slows down
You're back down on the ground
But then you walk right past me

I......really love you
Tho' it goes nowhere
You're on a ferris wheel 
Ride drive me crazy
Tho' it brings you closer
It just takes you up again

I......really love you
Tho' it goes nowhere
You're on a ferris wheel 
Ride drive me crazy
Tho' it brings you closer
It just takes you up again
Ride tho' it brings you closer
Ride till it takes you up again
Ride tho' it brings you closer
Ride till it takes you up again
