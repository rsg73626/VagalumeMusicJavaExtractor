CLEAR SAILING

There are times
When I'm caught up in depression
And a heady indigestion
Gets the best of me

Don't go away
Though the story may seem sad at first
The bridge may remedy
The verse away

When I'm down
Under the weather, it don't get better
Way down
Under the weather it don't get better
I lie down
A little lower, you move a little slower
Way down to the bottom 'til you hit rock bottom
You're down about as low as you can go
The only way is up and through the door
Clear sailing, clear sailing

Well here's the message
The tears just wet things 'til they're wetter
The occasional down makes up seem better
Or so the story goes
