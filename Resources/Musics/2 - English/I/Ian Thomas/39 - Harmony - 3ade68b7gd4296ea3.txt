HARMONY

I don't like the system
Too many kinks
Hear lots of talkin'
Nobody thinks
Listen to the common man, he don't give a damn
Just trying to make a living, the best that he can

Harmony, what the whole world want
Harmony, what the common people want
Living, feeling, breathing, dancing
Getting in some deep romancing

I don't like the system
It takes you so far
Big business watching
Wherever you are
In Russia, in China there are people just like us
Tired of propaganda, tired of all the fuss

Harmony, what the whole world want
Harmony, what the common people want
Living, feeling, breathing, dancing
Getting in some deep romancing

Harmony, what the whole world want
Harmony, what the common people want
Harmony, what the whole world want
Harmony, what the common people want
Living, feeling, breathing, dancing
Getting in some deep romancing

That's what the whole world wants
Mmmmm harmony
Living, feeling, breathing, dancing
Getting in some deep romancing
Mmmm what the whole world want
Harmony
