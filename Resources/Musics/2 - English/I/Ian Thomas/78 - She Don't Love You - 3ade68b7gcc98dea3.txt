SHE DON'T LOVE YOU

When laughter turns to silence
And that silence won't go away
When you're going through the motions, but somehow nothing feels the same
She don't love you, she don't love you any more

When you're looking out your window
Wondering where she always goes
The question is stuck inside you, 'cause you really don't want to know
She don't love you, she don't love you any more

You've got to let her go, leave it all behind you
She don't love you, she don't love you any more

So we find you walking aimlessly
Along the roads that you recall
Staring at graffiti in some heart shape oh the wall
She don't love you, she don't love you any more
