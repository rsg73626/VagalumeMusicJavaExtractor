STILL HERE

Late at night, when I get to thinking
I'm so hard done by
I take a look around and I can't feel sorry for myself

Some things I've wanted most, I've got
But some have passed me by
They're the motivation to try, they're the reason

I'm still here, in case it slipped your mind
I am still here, if you feel so inclined
I am still here, still here
Waiting for the break that's takin' its sweet time

Oh I have my moments, I'm discouraged
And I'm weary of the chase
But still some people believe, so I get back in the race

Though you're small in number
You can't know how much you mean to me
You're all the help I need, you're the reason

I'm still here
