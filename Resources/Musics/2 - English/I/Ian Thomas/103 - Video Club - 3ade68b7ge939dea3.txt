VIDEO CLUB

Chorus

You're OK, if you've got nothing to say
That's the way we like it, all the time
Everybody's watching, nobody's talking
Life's the way we like it, all the time

I love the media, video radio video all the time
They can do everything for you, turn it on, turn it up
Fix the vertical line

If you feel frustration, press the button
Change the station
'Til you find the fascination... station

Chorus

I don't need the real world
No fine tune, nothing you would ever do
Could make it right
Lose yourself in a media world
Slow motion, fast forward... play all night

If you feel frustration, press the button
Change the station
'Til you find the fascination... station

Chorus
