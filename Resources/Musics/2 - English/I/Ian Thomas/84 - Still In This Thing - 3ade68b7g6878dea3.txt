STILL IN THIS THING

I met this girl, a long time ago
Who could have guessed that it would last this long?
Why this thing works, I'll never know
It might be comfortable or where I belong

To lose you now I'd lose a piece of myself
And that's something I'm too selfish to ignore
So I don't even think about that any more

I'm still in this thing with you baby
Wherever this thing goes
And I've still got this thing for you baby
More than you'll ever know

Now I'm not saying everything's perfect
There are days she'd like to smack my face
When I don't listen or say something sexist
Or if I try to speak in her place

My eyes still wander like they're programmed to
I can be such a typical man
But my heart made up it's mind so this is where I am

I'm still in this thing with you baby
Wherever this thing goes
And I've still got this thing for you baby
More than you'll ever know

Don't ask me how I got this thing
Like I could give you some kind of map
For all I know we're all just shooting craps
