I STILL WANT TO HOLD YOU

Here I've loved you for so many years
I still want to hold you
Though I've seen all your weaknesses and fears
I still want to hold you

In those awkward phases, that we tend to go through
I still want to hold you
When I seem very distant and there's no talking to me
I still want to hold you

You, you love me for myself
You see things as they are
And with you there's nothing to trying
No deception or lying
I've come to rely on you

So we're getting older and we've looked much better
I still want to hold you
Well we'll only see what we care to remember
I still want to hold you

When we're sitting in the twilight, taking things slower
I'll still want to hold you
'Til my last breath, when the lights begin to lower
I'll still want to hold you

You, you love me for myself
You see things as they are
And with you there's nothing to trying
No deception or lying
I've come to rely on you

You, you love me for myself
You see things as they are
And with you there's nothing to trying
No deception or lying
I've come to rely on you
