TOUCH ME

It's an ocean, it's an ocean out there
That keeps all things apart
But there's something 
There is something out there
That's looking for a place to start

So touch me once like the rain on the river
Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever
Keep this moment alive and don't let go

Cause it's an ocean, it's an ocean out there
An ocean of souls who've been denied
The constant, the one tangible reflex
The sense of touch that tells no lies

So touch me once like the rain on the river
Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever
Keep this moment alive and don't let go

We are the beings who have made
This distance between ourselves and wonder what is wrong
And now here we lie, waiting for a sign
And too afraid to...
Touch is all, all is touch
Words may fall, but they don't mean much

So touch me once like the rain on the river
Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever
Keep this moment alive and don't let go
So touch me
Touch me

Touch me once like the rain on the river
Touch me like the rain
Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me and I will know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever
Keep this moment alive and don't let go
Touch me
And don't ever let go
Never let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Never let go
Never let go
Don't ever let go
Never let go
Don't ever let go
Never let go
