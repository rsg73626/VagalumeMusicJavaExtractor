SALLY

Well you say that I'm uncool
And I seem like such a tool
'Cause my blue jeans are not quite faded
That I should try to non-conform
Keep my distance from the norm
As for my taste... it just don't make it

You say I'm silly, that I'm not up to date with what's goin' on
Well I'm sorry, but your peer pressure logic is all wrong

Sally wake up your time is up
Like you say pass√©
Your social ladders, they only matter
To the fools that play
C'mon Sally... Sally
Sally wake up your real friends
Are all just slipping away

Go on say you make your choices
Then listen to the voices
In your crowd who make the rules in your game
All your non-conforming friends
Well just take a look again
In their difference they all look the same

You're going under, though your platform shoes
Are the latest thing
Makes me winder, if at that altitude
Maybe your air is thin

Sally wake up
