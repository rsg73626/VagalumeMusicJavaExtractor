ALL I DO

I guess it's you, though my eyes may wander
All I do seems to point to you
It won't be long, though it may seem much longer

Chorus

All I do... all I do and all I want to say
All I do... is lay awake until the night is day
All I do... if I be close, if I be far away from you

The things I say
The things that go unspoken
All I do seems to come from you
And so on and so on forever

Chorus

Nobody knows where you begin where I end
Nobody else receives the signals that I send
No misunderstanding, what I feel, what I say
It won't be long no, 'til I say
It's all I do

Chorus
