ART OF LIVING

Once in awhile i'll see somebody
About to make the same mistakes as me
So i'll try to do something good and save them a little grief

I'll say, "hey you, get away from that thing
It's about as hot as hell!"
They'll smile and thank me very much and then
Go and touch it for themselves

This is the art of living, this is the art of taking and giving

Don't tell me what to do i'll muddle my way through
Don't make any excuses for me
I'll take what's coming my way and be what i will be
It's not that i don't appreciate the thought for heaven's sake
But i won't lie in any bed that i cannot make

This is the art of living, this is the art of taking and giving

Now don't go drawing any lines on the ground
Somebody always comes along who won't walk around
Some are going to lose yeah and some are going to win
But everybody gets caught in

The art of living
