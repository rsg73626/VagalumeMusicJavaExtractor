DIRTY LOVE

The stifling heat. Your body sweat. Cheap hotel, the cheapest yet
What caught your fancy? Them high heeled shoes?
Or was it just the thought of what she can do?

Come here. Give me some
Dirty love

She's seen it all. She does requests
What you've got in mind, nobody's done yet
The floor is hot. The air is hot. Her skin is hot
Everything is hot

Come here, Give me some
Dirty love

Tell me why it's supposed to be bad
When it feels so good?
Oh never mind, I can't help myself
And I wouldn't if I could

Come here. Give me some
Dirty love

Go ahead, tell me I'm low, been led astray
Pass your judgement. Have your say
But I don't recall asking you
And how do you think you got here anyway?

That's right, dirty love
Come here. Give me some
Dirty love

Don't just talk about it. Well I suppose you can
Sometimes that's okay
Dirty love
