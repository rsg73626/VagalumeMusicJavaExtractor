TIDAL WAVE

Taking the world on, nothing can stop you
You're ranting and starting to rave
No time for sympathy, don't need no company
You're riding a tidal wave

Takin' it easy life is so breezy
'Cause you never take time to save
It's all going to fall, you won't have nothing at all
'Cause you're riding a tidal wave

Such a fool, if only your eyes could see
Think you're cool, well you don't mean nothin' to me

Taking the world on, nothing can stop you
You're ranting and starting to rave
No time for sympathy, don't need no company
You're riding a tidal wave 

Chorus

Thinking you're so high well you won't get by
'Cause you don't know something's there
Seas getting higher, skies getting darker
Thunder's filling the air
Caught up in your own clouds and now you can't run anywhere

Chorus

Tidal wave, tidal wave 

(repeat)
