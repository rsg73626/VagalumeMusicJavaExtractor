VOICES OF THE CHILDREN

When was the last time
You heard the voices of the children
They are trying to get through to you
But you won't take the time to listen
You've been so wrapped up in yourself
If you don't act fast, you'll miss them

They want to tell you what they've seen
Through eyes so clearly gifted
The wonder in the ordinary things
You take for granted
These voices you've no time to hear
Have everything you wanted

But you've some notion in your mind
The metaphysical grind is food to you
So you try to leave your body to find
The spirit that eludes you
What a waste of time, in time when it's ready
It will leave you
Oh you're so screwed up

The voices of the children...

They'll show you how to be alive
The basic simple senses
They'll lead you through the open fields
Where you've constructed fences

The voices of the children...
