STRINGIN' A LINE

He says he's your friend 
But you don't see him
He says he's so damn busy but he don't do nothin' at all
So you get him on the phone, he was just gonna to call you
Says he was thinking about old times
And lookin' at your picture on the wall

He's stringin' you the same old lines
He puts everyone through
They're only lies, intentions just won't do
For the time he feels no wrong
Til he finds out we've caught on
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line

So you try to forget 
But that ain't so easy
If you've got one small doubt, that there was ever anything there
So you dangle on a line, a captive fool
You know you'll try again
But it'll just be the same as last time

He's stringin' you the same old lines
He puts everyone through
They're only lies, intentions just won't do
For the time he feels no wrong
Til he finds out we've caught on
He's stringin' a line

He's stringin' you the same old lines
He puts everyone through
They're only lies, intentions just won't do
For the time he feels no wrong
Til he finds out we've caught on
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line
He's stringin' a line
