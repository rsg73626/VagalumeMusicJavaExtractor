LIVING ON THE DOLE

Everyone's standing in a line, now that they've gone and closed the mine
Nobody heard the town fall, never you mind the queen's paying for it all

Chorus

The whole town's living on the dole, don't want to go to work
'cause it ain't worth much more
And so they just sit there waiting for the dole
All day long

You better watch out 'cause in the end, there won't be any money to spend
The line will go as far as you see, wishing they'd open the factories

Chorus
