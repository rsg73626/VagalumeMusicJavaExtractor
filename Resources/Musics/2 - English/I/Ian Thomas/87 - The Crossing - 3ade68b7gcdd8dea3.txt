THE CROSSING

All the promises I've broken on you
And all the bridges I have burned
All the words I should never have spoken, I said to you
Near the point of no return

I was so blinded by ambition I couldn't see
I was such a single minded tool
'Til an awakening of senses came over me
Turned it all around and now I'm looking for the crossing

That takes me back to you and I
A better place a better time
My body is weak but something pushes me on

I'm looking for the point of return
I'm looking for the place I belong
I'm looking for the crossing... 
here my love lies

I am such a retrospective genius, I know I know
I just want to go back where I've been
I want to find the valley between us and go
I once had what I seek and now I'm looking for the crossing
