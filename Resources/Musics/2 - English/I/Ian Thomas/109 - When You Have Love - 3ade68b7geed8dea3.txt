WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE

When you have love nothing is lost
Only the moment it takes to decide
Realizing there's nothing to hide
No more crying inside
When you have love

No other word than love
That can heal up a scratch or a sore
That can open a closing door
No more hurting inside}
When you have love

From now until I die
The mountains won't grow old
The rivers always flowing
World without end
When you have love

When you have love there's nothing to hide
You'll see castles with doors open wide
You'll see children running outside
No one's standing on guard
When you have love

Well there's nothing left to say
Only you must go your own way
That's the price that you have to pay
A day is not a day
Until you have love
