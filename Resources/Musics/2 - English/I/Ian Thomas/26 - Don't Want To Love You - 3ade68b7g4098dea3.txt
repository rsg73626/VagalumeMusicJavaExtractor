DON'T WANT TO LOVE YOU

I don't want to love you
But the harder I try
The more I think of you
Matter over mind

I don't want to need you
But the harder I try
I just have to see you
Just a look in your eyes

But what about tomorrow?
The show's on the road, I'm away
The time we had was borrowed
That's what I've been trying to say
I don't want to love you

If I were to love you
What good would it be?
Always away from you
Can't I make you see?

There won't be any tomorrow
The show's on the road I'm away
The time we had was borrowed
That's what I've been trying to say
I don't want to love you...
