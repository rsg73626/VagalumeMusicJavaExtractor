ONE LITTLE WORD

I didn't want to say the things I said last night
I didn't want to see that pain on your face
And I surprise myself how far I will go
When some little piece of my pride is at stake

I can't believe I've hurt the only soul I love
It's as though I'm watching someone else
And I would like to take back so many things I've said
Hindsight, I think is my hell

And what I want and what I'm trying to say:
One little word is all I need
And I would come back. You couldn't keep me away
One little word is all I need, one little word

Sorry is what I've said, at least what I'm trying to
Does it sound at all like that to you?
Sometimes behind what's said, you'll find what I really mean
Oh let this discontent undo

And what I want and what I'm trying to say:
One little word is all I need
And I would come back. You couldn't keep me away
One little word is all I need, one little word
