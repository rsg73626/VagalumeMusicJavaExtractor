BACK TO SQUARE ONE

Sometimes people drift apart for no reason
No one thing to blame, just an accumulation
Of unintended things that you might say

And when you finally realize you've got a problem
Oh and it's all too real, you stand accused of all
The changes in you that you could not feel

You might attempt to talk things over
And find there's not a single thing to say

It's time to move on, time to move on
Time to move to another track, it's time to take
Yourself on back to square one

Maybe this one won't be like the last one
Or like the one before, you feel it's tearing you apart
You can't take this broken heart anymore

So you try to pull yourself together
And say you'll get it right someday
