EVERY DAY

At the end of the day you'll feel sleepy
And the lights go out all over the town
Half the world just floats away dreaming
And once again, the sun must go down

Chorus

Why does it have to happen that way?
Every Day
Why does it have to happen that way?
Every Day 

And just when you've started your dreaming
And you just want to sleep to the bloody end
Hell's bells, the whole world starts ringing
And the sun, that old mother
Starts nagging your eyes again

Chorus
