THE WAY YOU FEEL

I've read all the self help books I can read
I've spent a fortune on psychotherapy
They say I need a better sense of self and such
Well all this information doesn't seem to help much

I'm just another grain in a desert full of sand
They say I've been socialized into who I am
Seems all these questions make my life a mess
But right at this moment I could really care less

All I know is I love the way you feel
Your face on my face, all is revealed
From the tip of your tongue to the touch of your hand
This I accept though I may never fully understand
Why I love the way you feel

I've read another theory that says I should really be in pain
And just when I was feeling good about myself again
Like a bird that flies south come the winter snow
Some things you learn and some things you just know

And I know I love the way you feel
Your face on my face all is revealed
From the tip of your tongue to the touch of your hand
This I accept though I may never fully understand

Why I love the way you feel
And I love the way you feel

Oh baby I love the way you feel
