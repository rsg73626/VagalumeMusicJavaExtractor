TOP OF THE WORLD

Here's my love song, i know it won't seem long
So what do you want, a great big story
With lots of pretty phrases and accolades and praises
Well here it is in all of its glory

When you say you love me i'm sitting on the top of the world
There's nothing above me sitting on the top of the world

Passing my time trying to find a rhyme
That says it all like it's never been before
Pushing my pen round's bringing my head down
So this is all you get, there ain't no more

Chorus

Where i can't feel no pain where everything seems sane

Chorus
