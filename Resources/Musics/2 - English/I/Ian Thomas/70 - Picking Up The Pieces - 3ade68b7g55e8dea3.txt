PICKING UP THE PIECES

We're crazy people in a crazy world
There's only one thing to do
We're all picking up the pieces

You fall in love with a beautiful woman
But she knows she's beautiful too
So you're picking up the pieces

You think your life is over
When something's taken away
You soon forget the way it was
You soon accept the change
And start picking up the pieces

Tough kid walking the city street
Got himself a hundred dollar cold
Well he's picking up the pieces

Rich bitch living in a beauty salon
Trying not to look so old
Well she's picking up the pieces
