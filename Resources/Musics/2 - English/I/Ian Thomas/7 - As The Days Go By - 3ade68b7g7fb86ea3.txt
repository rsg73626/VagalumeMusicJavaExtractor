AS THE DAYS GO BY

My love of life just gets stronger
As the days go by
And some things i wish they would last
Just a little bit long longer
As the days go by

And some things don't look to me
Like they used to be, no

(as the days go by)
I get a little closer to
(as the days go by)
A little bit closer to you
(as the days go by)
I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you

Sure as the wind keeps on changing direction
I've come to understand, there's no such a thing as perfection
And what went on before
Doesn't matter anymore

(as the days go by)
I get a little closer to
(as the days go by)
A little bit closer to you
(as the days go by)
I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you
To you
To you
Cause things don't look to me
Like they used to be
(as the days go by)
I get a little closer to
(as the days go by)
A little bit closer to you
(as the days go by)
I get a little closer to
(as the days go by)
A little bit closer to you
(as the days go by)
I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you
Mmmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
