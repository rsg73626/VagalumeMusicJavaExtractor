THESE ARE NOT GODS

You make a president, some guy, you never met
He's like a holy man, on your TV set
You got your rock n' roller, on guitar he's a wiz
Playing songs of social conscience
That's where the money is

These are not gods that you bow down to
(Never on a Sunday)
These are only people doing what they do
Mix a little money... Add a little fame...
Another god, there's a new one every day

You got your beautiful woman
Don't know what to say to her
So you don't say nothin'... to these people you defer?
Like the preacher preaching
Into greener pastures he leads
With his hand in your pocket... taking what you need

These are not gods
