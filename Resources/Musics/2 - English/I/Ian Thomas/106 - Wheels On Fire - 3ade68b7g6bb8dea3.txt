WHEELS ON FIRE

Well I was hiking down the highway, trying to get to my old girl
A man pulled over and he darn near drove her
Right up the side of a hill

Purple lights and goofballs, baby boots and whitewalls
Stickers saying "John loves Sue"
It was getting kind of late, I got in, so what could I do?

Those wheels were on fire, fire, tearing up the road
On fire, fire, tearing up the road
Will I ever see you again, ah will you know I loved you
Right to the end, tearing up the middle of the road
In a ball of fire

The radio was screaming, the streamers were streaming
That man was out of his tree
My life kept flashing before my eyes to think the last thing
I would see, would be
Purple lights and goofballs, baby boots and whitewalls
Stickers saying "John loves Sue"
It was getting kind of late, I got in, so what could I do?

Those wheels were on fire, fire, tearing up the road
On fire, fire, tearing up the road
Will I ever see you again, ah will you know I loved you
Right to the end, tearing up the middle of the road
In a ball of fire
