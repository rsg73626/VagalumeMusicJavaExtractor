JULIE

Julie it's night and you needn't be frightened
The world could get lost in your sorrow
Turn out the light you know you shouldn't try to fight it
There's got to be sunshine tomorrow

Chorus

Everything I try to say, you seem to take another way
I can't get through I'm just a joke to you
Julie

In my dreams all your lovin' it seems
To get better than I had expected
Julie close your eyes, it might come as a surprise
My intentions should not be respected

Chorus

Everything I try to say, you seem to take another way
You mean the most to me, you're just a ghost to me
Julie
