A GATHERING OF ANGELS

Standing on the ground where so many feet have stood
If only you could see them
The one's whose books you've read whose pictures hang upon your wall
Who've felt the things you're feeling

Chorus

What you do is up to you

The words you use are nothing new
It's just the way you rearrange them
I've been talking to the angels
No mirrors no magic spells
A gathering of angels
That everyone can see
You are given what you borrow 'til it's time for you to lend
The eyes that do your seeing
There's really no beginning and there really is no end
Just different ways of being
