TYCOON

Oh honey, no money
It's all been spent
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

Don't worry, no hurry
You were quite content
At least we had each other
At least we had each other

Then it came
Like a rainfall on a desert so dry
'Til the river was ridin' high
It picked me up
And then it swept me away
You looked at me as if to say

Don't let it change you
Don't let the money change you

It wasn't long, 'til you were gone
Now it's too late
And if I'm not mistaken
Here's one soul that's been taken

Obsession, possession
Knight me Tycoon
He look but he can't see you
You speak but he can't hear you
