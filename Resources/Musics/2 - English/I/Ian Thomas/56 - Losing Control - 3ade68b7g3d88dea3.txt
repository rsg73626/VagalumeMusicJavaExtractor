LOSING CONTROL

I saw a sailor afraid of the sea
Trying to capture what he could not be
A wounded animal trying to hide
A rich man who was poor inside

A black flower on a window sill
Someone within who no longer had the will
An eyewitness too afraid to speak
I saw the truth playing hide and seek

Losing control

I saw a priest who fell from grace
An old friend with the look on his face
An illusive dream you try to hold onto
The unsteady hand that it's falling through

Losing control

Heaven is hell unless you get a hold of yourself
This is who you are not somebody else
Life goes on even in the darkest place
Take a look at your face

Losing control
