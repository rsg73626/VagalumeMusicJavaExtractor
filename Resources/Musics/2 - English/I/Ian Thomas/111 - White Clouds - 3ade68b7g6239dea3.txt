WHITE CLOUDS

Where have all the years gone
They just seem to pass me by
My father was a young man
Now there's white clouds in his eyes

The hands and legs that tremble now
I remember were so strong
Where have all, where have all
Where have all the years gone

Where have all the years gone
They just seem to float away
My father was an old man
Now they've laid him in his grave
The hands and legs that trembled once
I remember were so strong
Where have all, where have all
Where have all the years gone

Where have all the years gone
They just seem to pass me by
I was a young man
Now there's white clouds in my eyes
My hands and legs that tremble now
I remember were so strong
Where have all, where have all
Where have all the years gone
