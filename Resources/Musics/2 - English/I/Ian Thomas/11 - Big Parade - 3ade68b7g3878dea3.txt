BIG PARADE

Everybody's looking for the answers
To everything they just can't understand
Some praise God and some sing Hare Krishna
Some go door to door to say the world will end

Well, it's all quite a sight
Everybody thinks they're right
And everybody else is just insane
Otherwise, their lives are down the drain
All the years they spent just selling their songs
Just to find out it's all wrong

Trying to find solutions to give life some meaning
Seems to be the way some people spend their time
All the time that's lost in fruitless thinking
Surrounded by so many gifts of every kind

Well, it's all such a shame
So many years gone down the drain
While life passes like a big parade
All the laughter, all the music's played
All the friends you know you could have made
Then the big parade is gone
Life's a big parade
