FREEFALL IN STARDUST

We all believed in the garden
Stardust was going to light the way
Down a path where all confusion
Sounded so distant where we lay
Stardust passed over
Out of the slumber
One less in number

Chorus:

He won't be back
No he's never coming back
He didn't see the Venus Trap
In the garden
A shadow in the night
Where there used to shine a light
From a spark that was forsaken
Chalk another one up on the wall
He is lost in a freefall in Stardust

The sixties wake so many left to wander
The empty look is in their eyes
Unfocused dreams left still to conquer
Are jumbled words they cannot find
Stardust passed over
Out of the slumber
Much less in number
