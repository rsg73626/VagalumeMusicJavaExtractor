MAKIN' IT HARD

Every time i call you, i just get the same reply
I get some other guy who tells me you're not there
And when i finally see you, well your eyes they seem so cold
It makes me want to fold and crawl away

You make it so hard, makin' it hard
Makin' it hard to love you

Even though you always say no, i'll keep on asking you to meet me
I'll keep on letting you beat me to the ground
Maybe someday you'll find a way to sec just what i'm after
Heartache will turn to laughter, so hurry i'm growing old

Chorus
