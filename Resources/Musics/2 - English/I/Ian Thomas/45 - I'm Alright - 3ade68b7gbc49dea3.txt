I'M ALRIGHT

I've been walked on, put down, called nasty names and such
But I'm alright
I've been told I was never going to amount to very much
But I'm still alright
Had a woman break my heart, watched my life fall apart
Wrote my last song, then another one came along
And I'm alright

Somebody always finds something wrong in ideas they could never create
And if one succeeds, they say they knew all along that idea was great
They'll try to steal your dreams, try to break your heart
Sometimes it takes longer, but you get stronger and stronger
Then you feel alright

You can't keep a good idea down son
You can push it underground some
But it all comes around
And everything's alright

I've been told without much grace the problem is my face
But I'm alright
That I was born too soon and I've been asked to leave the room
But I'm still alright
Go ahead break my heart. Go ahead tear me apart
Go ahead try to deceive me, but I believe, I do believe
I'll be alright

You can't keep a good idea down son
You can push it underground some
But it all comes around and
Everything's alright
Everything's going to be alright
