NIGHTMARES & DREAMS

Who are you, now that you're dreaming
Why don't you ever get up?
What do you do, now that you're dreaming
Why don't you ever get up?

I am the captain on the river, I am the god of the moon and sun
I am captured by Amazon women, I make love to everyone
Once I woke up, I was me, another nobody please
They wouldn't let me atone

I swept the floors in the day never had much to say
I ate and slept all alone, all alone
Alone on my sofa, thought it over
What was I gonna be
I said no to living, 'cause it was giving
Nothing but grief to me

Now, I am the king of the forest, I ask Merlin for a crystal ball
I see dungeons full of lonely women, and I make love to them all

Don't cry 'cause I won't wake up, at least nothing will break up
The way I seek my happiness
Keep the light of the day keep my food. keep my pay
Right now there's damsels in distress, and I'm a
Knight on a holy quest

That's who I'm gonna be
Now that I'm dreaming, what does it matter to you?
It's none of your business, don't need a witness
I got dreaming to do
