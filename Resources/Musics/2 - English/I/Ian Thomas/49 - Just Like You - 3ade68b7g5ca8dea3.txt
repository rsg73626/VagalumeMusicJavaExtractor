JUST LIKE YOU

There's a bright moon on the ocean
That dripped into the sea
It spread to the tide
Left nowhere to hide
The light keeps finding me

Just like you… just like you

I sailed across the sea to China
Hid in the ruins of Peru
No matter where I've been
A face I've seen
Reminded me of you

Just like you… just like you

I'm going mad
There's madness in my eyes
The love I had
I'm growing to despise
I go to bed
I try to get to sleep
I see your body hanging over me

Only you… only you

Something's tapping on my window
I run over and try to see
There's a whisper in the shadow
That seems to call to me

Just like you… just like you
