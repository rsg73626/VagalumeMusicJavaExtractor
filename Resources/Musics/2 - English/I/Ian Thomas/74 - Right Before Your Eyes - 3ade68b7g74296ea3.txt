RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES

Everyday I sit beside you on the bus to Madison Avenue
Work in the big gray store with the revolving doors
You don't even know my name
I guess that I'm to blame
Don't know the right things to say
So I pretend away, that I'm Rudolph Valentino

Pull up in my limousine
Oh, won't you come in out of the rain
And things will never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo you'll stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of
And right before your eyes I'll fall in love with you

Today I'm done with games
Gonna ask you for your name
Say, I've been watching you
I even know what you do
Maybe today I'll tell you
Have found the nerve to sell you
On a guy like me
Who wishes that he could be your Rudolph Valentino

Pull up in my limousine
Oh, won't you come in out of the rain
And things will never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo you'll stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of
And right before your eyes I'll fall in love with you
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

And baby right before my, right before my eyes I'll fall in love with you 
And maybe right before my eyes
You'll say you love me too
