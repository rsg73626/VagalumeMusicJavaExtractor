CHAINS

I don't want any trouble. I don't want to make any
waves.
I don't want any conscience. And I don't wanna be
brave.
I've kept my distance. My feelings have never been
shown.
I know that I've been walking fences, 
Denied what I have known.

I carry chains. (I carry chains.)
Heavy, heavy chains. (Chains that are made.)
I carry chains (I carry chains) 'round my feet.
I feel the weight (I feel the weight.)
Chains are the different things that should not be
hanging on me.

I put my conscience under a stone, the stone under the
ground.
Walked from where I had left it. I hoped it couldn't
be found.
My conscience persisted. It's a haunted seed I have
sown.
Calls me out from the distance
And it just won't leave me alone.

I carry chains. (I carry chains.)
Chains that are made. (Chains that are made.)
I carry heavy chains. (I carry chains.)
Talk about the weight. (I feel the weight.)
Chains are the temporary things that should not be
hanging on me
