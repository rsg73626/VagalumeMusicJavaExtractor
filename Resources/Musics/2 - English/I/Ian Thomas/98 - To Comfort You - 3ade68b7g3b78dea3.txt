TO COMFORT YOU

You've been down in the dumps it seems like forever
Now what have they done to you
Not a single thing has turned out the way you'd imagined
It all looks unreachable to you

You don't know for the life of you, what is missing
Or why it always happens to you
Now you don't like yourself, you feel nobody's listening
And you don't need another platitude

For a moment you forget and a smile comes to your face
But it doesn't last too long
It's like a string you've got tied around your finger
Reminding you of everything that's wrong

I won't try to say I know what you're feeling
And I won't try to second guess you
And I won't try to give advice you won't be needing
I'm only here to comfort you
I'm only here to comfort you

I'd love to be the reason a smile comes to your face
Even if it doesn't last too long
And I'd like to take that string you've got tied around your finger
That reminds you of everything that's wrong

I won't try to say I know what you're feeling
And I won't try to second guess you
And I won't try to give advice you won't be needing
I'm only here to comfort you

I'm only here to comfort you
