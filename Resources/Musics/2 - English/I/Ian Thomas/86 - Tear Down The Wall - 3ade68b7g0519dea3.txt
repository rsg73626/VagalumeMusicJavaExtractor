TEAR DOWN THE WALL

So you live in a castle, surrounded, defended
Afraid what's outside might hurt you
You say you've learned, were burned
When your whole life upended
And now nobody's gonna get near you

Oh, tear down the wall
Let a little bit of light shine through
Oh, tear down the wall
Let a little bit of light get to you

Well we all have castles
That we keep defending
We all have the locks and hide the keys
To keep out the truth, the real and unwanted
That we know but don't want to see

Oh, tear down the wall
Let a little bit of light shine through
Oh, tear down the wall
Let a little bit of light get to you

Oh, tear down the wall
Let a little bit of light shine through
Oh, tear down the wall
Let a little bit of light get to you
