FOR KNOWING YOU

I'm all the better for knowing you
You seem to make it all worthwhile
I'm never able to let you know
Without you the world would just stop turning
Love me all night 'til I'm sober
Turn me around and start over
Over and over and over
Love me all night 'til I'm sober

(repeat)

Love me 'til the cows come home, don't lie there and moan
You could be makin' it better
Shakin' all the things that you shake, c'mon give me a break
You could be makin' it better
Better than rock n' roll, better than your very soul, oh
Do Do-n-do
And in the morning, I will give you no warning
I'll have packed my bag, 'cause I don't want your nagging any more
Any more

Distance makes the heart grow fonder
All the days just seem to get longer
Distance makes the heart grow fonder fonder

Why can't I tell what I've got without leaving
How come 1 don't know without seeing
Distance makes the heart grow fonder fonder

Sooner or later, the sooner the better
Do you love all that matters or do you write them a letter?
Look around and try to feel, everything that makes you real

Feelin' makes the heart grow fonder fonder
Feelin' makes the heart grow fonder
Feelin' makes the heart grow fonder
Feelin' makes the heart grow fonder fonder

So I'll head on home, I can't stand my own self
Would you get the door it's me I've come for more and more and

Since I've been gone, I've sinned
Oh while I was gone, I sinned
She begged at my door 'til I let her in
Oh while 1 was gone I sinned

Love me all night 'til I'm sober
Turn me around and start over
Over and over and over
Love me all night 'til I'm sober

(repeat)
