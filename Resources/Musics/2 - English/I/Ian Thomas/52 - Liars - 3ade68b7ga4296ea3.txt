LIARS

You're all fools, don't you bother to say it
Well I'm through, and your money won't pay it
You're all liars, and you've been tellin' me lies
Yeah, you're liars, and I've caught you with your finger in the pie

I'm tired, takin' over command
You're all fired, my money's out of your hands
'Cause you're liars, and you've been tellin' me lies
Yeah, you're liars, and I've caught you with your finger in the pie

Build me up, you let me down, it's showing in my songs
I call you up, you're out of town, I won't last too long
You're all liars, and you've been telling me lies
Yeah, you're liars and I've caught you with your finger in the pie
Maybe you might call me, maybe I don't give a damn

Now I'm through, with all of your daydreams
All the glitter, and all your money machines
But you're liars, and you've been tellin' me lies
Yeah you're liars, and I've caught you with your finger in the pie
Build me up, you let me down, it's showing in my songs
I call you up, you're out of town, I won't last too long
Cause you're liars, and you've been telling me lies
Yeah you're liars and I've caught you with your finger in the pie

With your finger in the pie
With your finger in the pie
With your finger in the pie
With your finger in the pie
With your finger in the pie
