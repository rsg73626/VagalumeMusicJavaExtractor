THE TUCK POSITION

There's an absence of direction
In the digital world that surrounds me
A loss of peripheral vision
Just the sound of machines around me

Marooned, living in this time zone
If you want to stay alive
Assume the tuck position

A building blocks my window
Where the sun would come to find me
There's a light emitting diode
On a burned-out lamp behind me

Marooned living in this time zone
If you want to stay alive
Assume the tuck position
