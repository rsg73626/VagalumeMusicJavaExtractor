COMING FOR MY LIFE

You are always at my door
I know you're coming for my life
A shadow hanging over me
A story with an end and you see
You don't have to come for me, i'm fine

I have worked hard all my life
I've got me a wife and kids
If i wasn't there i wonder how they'd get along
Would it be so wrong for me to stay

I'm not afraid, it's just the world will still go on
Just as though i'd never had my day
Me and all the things i know
Will turn to dust and fade
And all important words will float away

Sometimes i think that i'm all right
I put up quite a fight against you
Then someone i know goes down
And you have won another round
When will it be time for me to go
