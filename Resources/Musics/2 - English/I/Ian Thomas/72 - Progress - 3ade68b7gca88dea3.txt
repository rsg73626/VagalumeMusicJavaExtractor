PROGRESS

We are fighting for the pride of the nation
We are fighting for a better condition
We are fighting in the name of religion
And the world is sick with starvation

It's an honour it's a matter of tradition
It's a matter of discrimination
It's a matter of intimidation
And the world is sick with starvation
And we call it

Progress, progress
One step forward, two steps back

Who gives a damn about the next generation

l need a fix I want some radiation
Refugees at every station
And the world still sick with starvation
And we'll call it

Progress, progress
One step forward, two steps back
