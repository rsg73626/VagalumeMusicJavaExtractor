LONG LONG WAY

Well we've come a long long way, 
Look at everything we know
We're getting smarter everyday, 
Ah but where's it gonna go
For all the words that go by, 
I've got a feeling inside
That after it's all said and done
Though we've come a long long way
This old world's not much better than it was

Oh it's just like the twenties, machine guns were plenty
Everyday you'd get shot up all the whisky'd get bought up
We'd be dancing the night through, just waiting until
The joke's on you, ah then what do you do

Model T's and Chevies just loaded with heavies
Shining faces like morning roses, aglow with their noses
Pressed on your window, just waiting to shine
Your concrete shoes, to the piano roll blues

We're flying space ships round the stars
Getting faster by the hour
Pretty soon we'll be on Mars
Build another Ivory tower
Thru all the praise that you borrow
There's still hunger and sorrow and after it's all said and done
Though we've come a long long way
This old world's not much better than it was

Oh it's just like the twenties, machine guns were plenty
Everyday you'd get shot up all the whisky'd get bought up
We'd be dancing the night through, just waiting until
The joke's on you, ah then what do you do

Oh
Model T's and Chevies just loaded with heavies
Shining faces like morning roses, aglow with their noses
Pressed on your window, just waiting to shine
Your concrete shoes, to the piano roll blues
