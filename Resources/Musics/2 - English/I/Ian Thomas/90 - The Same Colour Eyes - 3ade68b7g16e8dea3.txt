THE SAME COLOUR EYES

She's got the same colour eyes
And she looks like you do
She's got a tendency to say
Some of the same things you do

It's hard to get the picture when you look from within
So you can call it all off and start over again
Well here I am with somebody who looks just the same as you do

Kind of funny when two people
Going two separate ways
Realize that they're looking for
Somebody just the same

Simple little words make insurmountable walls
As emotion rises intelligence falls
'Til what was once right makes no sense at all
Like it used to

Now this whole thing is crazy
I hear he's just like me
It makes me think just maybe
Things weren't as bad as they seemed

So I'm calling the whole thing on
The logic is too strong
I'm putting you back where you belong...
She's got the same colour eyes
And she looks like you do
