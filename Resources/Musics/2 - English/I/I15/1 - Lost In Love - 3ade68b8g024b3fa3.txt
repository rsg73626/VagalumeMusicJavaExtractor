LOST IN LOVE

Listen girl
They call me
Polow da Don
And I got my boys with me
They go by the name I-15
And you know what we came to do..
(Get money!)

[Verse 1: Castro]
She don't know no better
Triflin with my heart
Like it was a parade of fun
In and out of love
Make me feel inadequate
If I try to perfect it
She wouldn't even let me (let me)
And now it seems another man stole her heart
And so I'm off in the dust again
If you rewind and play it back
And just do it all over

She's bad
Perfect frame
Flyest thing I've ever seen
Super model
Wedding ring
But she's lost in love
She got game
Smoother then Big Daddy Kane
Always therefore I ain't playin
But she's lost in love

[Verses 2: Das]
I must have over slapped on her
She wants me when she wants me
Otherwise she really don't care
She's a keeper with a players mind (yea)
When we in public, she don't know me
At home she treats me like a king
She don't understand (No)
And now it seems another man stole her heart
So I'm off in the dust again
If you rewind and play it back
And just do it all over

She's bad
Perfect frame
Flyest thing I've ever seen
Super model
Wedding ring
But she's lost in love
She got game
Smoother then Big Daddy Kane
Always therefore I ain't playin
But she's lost in love

[Rap: Flash] 
Yeah she's so slick
She got a man, but he ain't it
I tell her I be there when she wants something 
She keep callin me telling me she wants something
And now I'm caught up in the matrix
I see what you do
I don't say shit
I can't find a replacement
She's so bad she make a dime look basic

She's bad
Perfect frame
Flyest thing I've ever seen
Super model
Wedding ring
But she's lost in love
She got game
Smoother then Big Daddy Kane
Always therefore, I ain't playin
But she's lost in love
