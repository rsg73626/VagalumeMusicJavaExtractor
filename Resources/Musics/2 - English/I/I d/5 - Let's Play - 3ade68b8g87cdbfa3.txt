LET'S PLAY

Computerized Voice:
I.D do you want to play

I saw you standing
on the corner
only yesterday
And I just couldn't look away
What was it that you had that
kept me in this fantasy
That kept me staring all day

But now you noticed me and
now I see I'm not alone
So what exactly do I say
I would like to be the man for you
so here's the deal
could you come over and play

Ooh you're hot
Give me all the love you've got
You know you really, really turn me on
And ooh I've got,
Lots of tricks you'll like a lot, oh
I wanna shake you
I wanna take you away

Hey hey,

We’re gonna boom boom the night away
Are you set or excited yet
cause were gonna get it on
Hey hey come on let's play
We’re gonna boom boom the night away
Don't you fret
gonna make you sweat
Let me freak you till the dawn

So now that you and me are gonna go
and finally be
Exactly as I had it planned
No need for no one else to come
and sweep you of your feet
You know I am the only man

I never dreamed that you and me
would go and play these games
No one would ever understand
So let me be the one to show you
how it feels so please
Don't be afraid to take my hand
