MY LITTLE DOVE

Crows are crying
Dogs won't give up
And I keep trying
But I can't keep up
Coast is clear
Why aren't my thoughts?
And then through the chatter
There's a gentle song

O little dove I can barely hear you
Won't you come more near?
You fill my ears with the songs I love
They fill the air with ugly sounds
But they could never drown out
The song of my little dove

O little dove I can barely hear you
Won't you come more near?
You fill my ears with the songs I love
They fill the air with ugly sounds
But they could never drown out
The song of my little dove
