NICE TRY

Nice try, but I won't pass on this
A high-five to everyone who helped you miss
Nice try, but how we gonna make this fit
It's high time for somebody to help with it

Maybe you will get yourself out
Maybe you'll get away, how about that?
Maybe you will see yourself dry
Get beyond the rocks, with just cut-feet
But your heart still beats
And we all like that, don't we?

Nice try but we're never gonna make this fit
It's high time for somebody to help with it

We all like that, when your heart beats
