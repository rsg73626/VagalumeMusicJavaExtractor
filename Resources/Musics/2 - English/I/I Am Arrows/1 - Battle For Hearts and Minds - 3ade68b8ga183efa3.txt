BATTLE FOR HEARTS AND MINDS

I cannot fight, I haven't got a sword or a gun
Even if I did, I'm not sure whose side I'de be on
'cos love battles harder than the hate that we possess
And the battles get harder, when you start saying no when you mean yes

Here in my bed, I'm something you both agreed on
I'd up and leave, but I'm not sure how fast I could run
'cos love is the metre, by which we work, play and rest
So leave this 'til morning, 'til the sun comes up again

I can't fight because I'm unarmed
Even if I did, I'm not sure who I'm with, or what would give
Hearts and minds play with equal strength
I sit on the fence
Whilst my father lies and mother cries

I can't fight because I'm unarmed
Even if I did, I'm not sure who I'm with, or what would give
Hearts and minds play with equal strength
On this battle ground, yeah which we call home, but we can't stay here
