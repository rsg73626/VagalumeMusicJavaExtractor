NO WONDER

I woke up today, just for a little bit
Tried to fix a part of me, it just made me sick
Like it always did
It's no wonder
I remember days, you would call me up
I remember ways, I could make you stop
All the time just for me

Now, you fight, with no wonder
And now, you fight, for no one, no
Are you sure, you sure, you're over?

I've got no games to play, I can promise you that
I just want right out, but I'm guessing you know that
'Cos you always know

Now, you fight, with no wonder
And now, you fight, for no one, no
Are you sure, your spark, has died forever
Are you sure, you sure, you're over?
