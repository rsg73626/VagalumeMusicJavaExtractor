BRUISES

Bruises on feet that won't stop walking
Voices won't stop talking
They melt my eardrums to the brain
Exactly what they're saying, I guess we'll know in time

And what for now?
I guess you're more than I'll ever be
You always knew just how to walk
Unmarked, unloved away from everyone

Who's this? someone I can believe in
Someone to keep me feeling like I'm heading the right way
And who I'm supposed to play, well I guess I'll know in time

And what for now?
I guess you're more than I'll ever be
You always knew just how to walk
Unmarked, unloved away from everyone
Now who's holding on to those old times
And to old loves that just aren't listening
