FAR ENOUGH AWAY

Running on a wall, trying to keep my feet warm when it's cold
Getting it wrong again, doing exactly what we're told
Watching bottles on a wall, they're inviting me to watch them when they fall
Getting it wrong again

Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away for you, today?

Running from a wall, trying to do the right thing by you all
Getting it wrong again, doing exactly what we're told
Now I'm waiting on a word, telling us to get away while we can
Getting it all wrong again

Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away for you, today?
Am I far enough away?

Like bottles on a wall, they're inviting me to watch them when they fall
Getting it wrong again

Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away for you, today?
Am I far enough away
