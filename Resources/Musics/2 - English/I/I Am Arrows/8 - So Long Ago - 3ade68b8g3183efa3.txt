SO LONG AGO

We listen to one another thought we don't know why
It made sense when we were together, it made sense to cry
How we hold out our arms
Fold them around each others pain
But in the end we gain nothing

Oh, forever wondering what could've been
If you hadn't walked away and both of us leaned
On our wishes and words, they went unheard
We weren't heard, heard
We got hurt, hurt

Unassisted we learned, it was so long ago
That our hearts got their turn, in a world they didn't know
And a battle we'd fight, at a price we couldn't pay
It was soul that we lost
But it's too close to say

So, how does it feel now all the way over there
Different friends in different places
We try not to care
But I won't understand, what breaks these things up
It was love I was told, but you put a stop
This isn't love anymore
This isn't love anymore

Unassisted we learned, it was so long ago
That our hearts got their turn, in a world they didn't know
And a battle we'd fight, at a price we couldn't pay
It was soul that we lost
But it's too close to say

I we were to think about where this would go
Would we leave it to other hearts, and ask them to show
If they care?
How they care?

Unassisted we learned, it was so long ago
That our hearts got their turn, in a world they didn't know
And a battle we'd fight, at a price we couldn't pay
It was soul that we lost
But it's too close to say
