THE US

I took my time, and got a little lost
I was not told, and had a feeling I'd been crossed
If you think I'm looking a little grey
It's just the way I'm feeling these days

Is this the us you've fallen for?
If it is then we're done for
Is this the us you've fallen for?
I guess it's what we all long for

If we'd have thought about the walls we'd have to climb
Would we see this through and feel like everything was just fine?
If you see me looking the other way
It's just the way I'm looking these days

Is this the us you've fallen for?
If it is then we're done for
Is this the us you've fallen for?
I guess it's what we all long for
