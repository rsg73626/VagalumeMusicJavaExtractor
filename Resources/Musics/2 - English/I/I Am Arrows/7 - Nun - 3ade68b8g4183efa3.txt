NUN

Hanging around with you it's like the sunshine's always out
So I move in with you - I move straight back out
I've got someone, a little something for you
Like pouring rain on snow or a stone inside your shoe
Hey! hey!

No I'm not laughing at you, just 'cos I'm not living with you
No I never really believed, I really really see now I see

Hanging around with you I'm like a thorn deep in your side
I learned how to fight the thunderclap with tight-shut eyes
I've got someone, she's a little something for you
Like rainfall all through June or a stone inside your shoe
Hey! hey!

No I'm not laughing at you, just 'cos I'm not living with you
No I never really believed, I really really see now I see, I do
All I really wanted from you, was to see that I was actually through

I've got someone, a little something for you
Like pouring rain on snow or a stone inside your shoe
Hey! hey!
Eyes shut so tight

No I'm not laughing at you, just 'cos I'm not living with you
No I never really believed, I really really see now I see, I do
All really wanted from you, was to see that I was actually through
No I'm not laughing at you, I'm not laughing at you
