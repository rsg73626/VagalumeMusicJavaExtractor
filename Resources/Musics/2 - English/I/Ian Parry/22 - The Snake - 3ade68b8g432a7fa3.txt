THE SNAKE

Like the snake
You crawled around
Now nobody likes you
Constantly sneakin' about

Where is it written
Be cruel to be kind

Don't pity, don't you pity me
Not a single friend in sight
No pity please, luck is running out
They're all to blame

So much hate
You've wondered why
Such an obvious answer
The friends that you had, you'd buy

Your skin keeps on changing
You think like the snake

[Solo]

They're all to blame... it isn't me
