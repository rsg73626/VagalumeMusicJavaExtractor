GARDEN OF EDEN

[Verse]
I'm surrounded by hatred
It's destroying my soul, an evolutionary sin
Is it part of our D.N.A.
This aggression nature within

[Bridge]
A hundred thousand years
And still we can not learn, to live amongst ourselves
Together peaceably, without the need to kill

[Chorus]
I wanna be, somewhere else
Wish I could find, my garden of eden
Perfectly, by myself
Locked inside, my garden of eden

[Verse]
To suffer indifference, you don't have a voice
Such unaccountability
Is a misconceptional way
Created a wave of rage

[Repeat Bridge & Chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
Locked inside... by myself
