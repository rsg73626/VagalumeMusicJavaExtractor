CHANGE BREEDS CONTEMPT

See how we waste our enegy
tô protect our lives our primal instinct
Insignificant ways... paramount
There must be more than this
It's like a reservoir of hate

All indifference, signifies
We're unprepared, for change
No reluctance is, very rare
When shall we walk, in one direction

Change breeds contempt, and misery
When you fight it, we're history
Change breeds contempt, instinctively
Have faith not, hostility

It's hard tô reach society
The methods they all praise, inspires complacency
Is this why we're so afraid
