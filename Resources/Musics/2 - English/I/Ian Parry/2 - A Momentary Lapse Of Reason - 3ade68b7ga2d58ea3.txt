A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON

A Momentary Lapse Of Reason

[Verse]
In a momentary lapse of reason
Toleration was something unknown
And all attempts failed, to stop all the violence
The outcome was clear [Backing vocal]
It seemed evolutionary, the dawning a new era came
A new species was born, a society in Fragmentation
With separate ways

[Bridge]
Extreme behaviour [Backing vocals]
Not accepted by all, now it's been rejected

[Chorus]
Only time will tell
If the sanctity of man prevails, a new era soon is born

[Verse]
In a momentary lapse of reason, men were about to destroy
All the beauty god gave, as the acid in rain started pouring down
So women appoint only women, with a spirit of kindness and sense
In positions of power, to eliminate years of destruction
Before it's to late

[Repeat Bridge]

[Chorus]
Only time will tell
If the sanctity of man prevails
A new era soon is coming, the birth of a brand new way

[Spoken part:] Un punto di non ritorno,
La natura aggressiva dell'uomo non puo' piu' essere tollerata, una nuova era sta iniziando.

[Ad-libs:]
Only time, only time will tell, there's a brand new day
A new day's dawning [Backing vocals]
Only time will tell, there's a brand new
