THE CATALYST

The Catalyst

[Verse]
Their cries for help ignored, society in disarray
It's unbelievable, what's happening
In this way, 'cos nobody heeds the warnings

[Bridge]
What will be, if we follow this path, to anarchy
The one's we love will be left in mourning
.... left in mourning

[Verse]
So the Elders of the day, gathered in their Millions
Their strength in numbers is significant
For change that will make, a difference

[Chorus]
Falling, falling
One by one as the tears keep pouring
Watch them, falling
Count the cost as the tears keep pouring

[Middle-8:]
Now there's no return, 'cos what's been done is done
The battle has been won
The Catalyst is man's own weakness

[Ad-libs]
The one's we love, you're not alone, the one's we love
You're not alone
