WHAT YOU SOW, YOU REAP

What You Sow, You Reap

[Verse]
Throughout the centuries
Many things in time unfold
A fable or two, who cares if they're true
Those harmless stories told... so they say

[Bridge]
But was it total madness, as the signs went ignored
For some their natural instinct, showed them clearly

[Chorus]
Hollow ground
It's time to follow another way
Hollow ground
When tomorrow's brand new day

What you sow is what you reap [Backing vocals]
What you sow is what you reap [Backing vocals]

[Verse]
The way ahead was clear, an incredible task to do
Let the truth be known or may the heavens fall
Thankfully sense prevailed.... separation

[Bridge]
So there's a moral to this story
What comes around goes around
An though they're all gods children
A few, still walk on
