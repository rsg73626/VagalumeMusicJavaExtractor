MIRROR IMAGE

Mirror Image

[Verse]
An' though on the outside they may look the same
Inwardly, they're many worlds apart
Uncertainty a species now divided
The fear of the unknown
Walking alone in the dark

[Bridge]
Suddenly they're cast away in silence
Like a mirror image for the good of us all
Through all of those years nothing had changed [Backing vocals]
But in this new world there are changes and more

[Chorus]
Go beyond this space [Backing vocals]
You've gotta walk on through the door
Find a better place [Backing vocals]
An' leave the past behind
Discover ways to change [Backing vocals]
You've gotta search inside your soul
Now can you see [Backing vocals]
There's a new day, a new day dawning
(There's a new, a new day)

[Verse]
A perfect generation is created
As one, without suffering or pain
Technology the father of creation
What's a child without a name
In this fatherless world

[Bridge]
Cast away into a new horizon
Embrace the soul, open your mind
Through all of those years nothing had changed [Backing vocals]
But in this this new world there are changes and more

[Repeat Chorus]
