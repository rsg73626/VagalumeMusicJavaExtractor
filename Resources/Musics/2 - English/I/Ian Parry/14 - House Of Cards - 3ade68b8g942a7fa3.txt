HOUSE OF CARDS

[Verse]
To rush around in circles, it shows
Where others simply stroll
And in this life when did you ever think twice
Once so long ago

[Bridge]
Another chance, another risk you thirst
You can't afford
A solid ground, on walls we have to build at first
Or down they'll fall

[Chorus]
Stay awake, in the house of cards
Stay awake, there won't be a warning

[Verse]
Strange how situations unfold
Just when you least expected
An' on the surface everything may seem nice
Beneath you're unprotected

[Bridge]
Your uncontrolable desires, rare
Will take their toll
Don't underestimate the power, of life we share
Think first before

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat chorus]
