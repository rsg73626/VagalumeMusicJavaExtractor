EVILWORLD

[Verse]
I'm slowly losin' them, the few friends that I had
All attempts to win them back
Have been to no avail

[Bridge]
Wasted years, wasted yesterdays

[Chorus]
Am I living in an evilworld
Have I been living in a daze

[Verse]
I wept a silent tear,
As one by one they turned away
I've built a wall around myself
Invisable but safe

[Bridge]
Wasted years [backing vocals]
An empire built on immorial grounds
May come crashing down

[Chorus]
If I search inside my mind
What shall I find
Am I living in an evilworld
I'm afraid to open - up my eyes
The truth I'll find
Is it me who built this evil place

[Middle-8:]
Have I broke the golden rule
To sacrifice all my friends
When I lie, cheat, and fool
I'm lyin' to myself

[Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
Will I ever search inside my mind
Is it real 'am I livin' in an evil world
