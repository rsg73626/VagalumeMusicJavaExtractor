BANQUET FOR THIEVES

[Verse]
The law is the truth
But the truth about the law can change
What's good for some of us
I wouldn't like to recommend it

Some may work hard, all the hours god gave
While others bend the rules
To mold into, a cruel advantage

[Bridge]
What is democracy
Without real justice for all
Societies legacy, protects them more and more

[Chorus]
They're laughing at us all
Their lies are accepted
It's a banquet for thieves

[Verse]
Defenders of the faith
More preposterous by the day
A distant empathy
From our parallactic view we remain

Can we sustain
A phenomenon in disarray
Once they cross, into our world
We're pages in the book, of misery

[Repeat Bridge & Chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
The law is the truth
