PANDORA'S BOX

A simple explanation
Can often clear the doubt
Which some of us can feel
Should we let, sleeping dogs lie

Inside the mind exists
A fragile breeding place, for ignorance and fear
Which shelters the shame

No-one, person is ever the same
No-one, person is ever tô blame

Slowly, slowly
No matter what the cost, secrets exposed
Slowly, slowly
A pandora's box, is harder tô close

The evil that men do, the hidden secrets
Aren't they better left alone
So why, prolong the pain

Don't search any deeper
If pandora has wings.. then there's no turning back

[Solo]
