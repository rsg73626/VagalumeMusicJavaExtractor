AS STRANGERS WALK BY

As Strangers Walk By

[Japanese bonus track]

[Verse]
Oh no!
Gotto live my life, all alone
Locked away in my circular home
The world outside, doesn't have a place
Thou people stir, I don't see a face
Gotta be alone, all on my own, leave me alone

[Verse]
I'm ready to blow, I've gotta pain, a curse in me
' bout as much as I can take, I'm ready to explode
The pressure's piling up on me, I've got no-where to go
Faces stiring back at me, pray tell, it is not so... oh no!

[Chorus]
I look around an' I can't, help they way I feel towards them
Inside my head the pain it, makes me mad
My mind's exploding... my mind's exploding
(As strangers walk by)

[Verse]
Anxiety grows, into a rage internally
It happens everytime, as strangers walk by
It starts in close proximity, with contact eye to eye
A disease inherent born in me
'til the day I die...'til the day I die

[Ad-libs]
'til the day I die, as strangers walk on by
Inside my head, there's a pain that makes me mad
My mind's exploding, there's a curse deep inside of me
'til the day I die
