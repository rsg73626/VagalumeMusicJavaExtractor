BACKSTAGE

Yeah, adult Hip Hop 25 and older put your hands up
Rich Nice where you at baby? Whoo!
I go by the name Bobby Bronson
Yeah, this is Disturbing Tha Peace
Every now and then we switch it up, you know
Mellow it out, I'm capable of that, you know

[Verse 1: I-20]
Yeah, now you about to hear the sounds of Down South Hip Hop
In my CL-Vert with the top just dropped
Some broad from backstage at the show I just rocked
but before I hit the room I make a quick pitstop
Late night, Buckhead, time to hit the BP
a new pack a switches and a box of MC's
Got no time for playin hope the broad know well
the penthouse suite at the Swiss Hotel
It's the real after party if you tryna meet me
got anything to drink, I just need some I.D
If you know you ain't cutting it's gonna be a long walk
cause you came here for nothing if you think we gonna talk

[Chorus Butch Cassidy]
Backstage we chilling where the players are
the ladies hoping just to meet a star
and ain't telling what they gonna do
we been sitting on the couch for all the things we do
we'll only take you if you bad as hell
no disrespect if you look so well
its kind of crazy if you understand
so let's take advantage now, and keep these hoes in check

[Verse 2: I-20]
Now I ain't tryna be rude but lets get this thing moving
if not keep it moving cause these other hoes choosing
If pussy was a drug I woulda been OD'd
if you niggaz fucking dimes then my bitch is a key
Pimp a dime, break a bitch, take the chick of the leash
so if niggaz wanna hit it you can rent it at least
sounds fucked up don't it, but it's part of the game
Same women holla lover all caught up in fame
And the girls at 'cris concert be acting the worst
claiming they don't know a nigga but they rapping my verse
It's cool shawty, you ain't gotta know me to cut
cause if you know me then you probably know I'm ready to cut

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: I-20]
Love this ain't hip hop, this and this is all a little message
that our dressing room is really for undressing
You wanna talk to me, even date me at that
But the night still young baby later for that
You wanna know my real name, where I'm from, how to start
and me I'm just tryna get your legs spread apart
Yo nigga told you that he love you and you fell right in
and now you see he never meant it and his car was just rented
here's a drink, take a shot, take a sip, here's a glass
use that backstage pass to give me backstage ass
see it ain't no disrespect if you know you too proud
so take this autograph and stay the fuck in the crowd

[Butch Cassidy (I-20)]
Backstage the only place for you and me
then we head straight to the (?) (break it down)
there's no other place I'd rather be (come on)
between the sheets (speak to em, dog)
Backstage (everyone feel free to sing)
Get Paid (everybody hand should be up at this point)
Get Laid (we going back to the dance floor, you ready? 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus w/ (I-20 ad-libing)]
Yeah, the sounds of my man Butch Cassidy
I am The I-20, Eastside to the fullest
it's all love it's all good, ya'know

[I-20 talking]
25 and over adult hip hop, yeah
Butch Cassidy, I-20 Eastside
