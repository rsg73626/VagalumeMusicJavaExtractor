SLUMS

They'll like this here
It's time to represent the slums
Know what I mean
2-0(yeah)
Tit (bitch)
Shawnna (yeah)
(Bitch)


[Verse 1]
[I -20]
2-0 get it right from the get go
Go broke fuck around pull the kit closed
Talking shit in the dec here the clip go
Sit down smoke dro I'm a let tit flow

[Tity Boi]
This is for my nigga Bo locked in the pen
Done sold caine and even raised his kids
My folks in the holodome even know
I'm know where in the world bin Ladin is

[Shawnna]
Slow down yall why did them niggaz want some
and we a show them motherfuckers they'll get some
I'm from the city of shitty niggaz and big girls
Til we met tit and shawnna bring them the big thugs

[I-20]
Luda Fate Tity Ho I'm the Southside
Face down ass up with her mouth wide
You know the drill slangin pills tryna get green
I'm 2-0 but got a m-16

[Chorus]
(T) Slums
(I&S) all them niggaz and them bitches with there own ends
(T) Slums

(T) Slums
(I&S) who's in the trap and make them papers till the folks come
(T) Slums
(I&S) You know that they'll never change unless they owe something

[Verse 2]
(Tity Boi)
I'm like this corner I gotta stay bent
I need every quarter I gotta pay rent
I see you nigga you got fans and shit
But you gotta stop shakin and get your dancin ???

[Shawnna]
She hit a motherfucker straight up of the block serving rocks
Trying to get in my socks before the cops see
And if a nigga wanna take it to the glocks wanna shock
Quicker then a motherfuckers wanna pop me

[I-20]
Keep it chill what you know about Scottsdale
Even late fighting pits and the glocks tale
Mack 10's church preachers even cops tell
And now he pleading over bread cuz the block fell

[Tity Boi]
When I was dead broke I didn't like postas
stuntin round me might stunt your growth
Draw down on four pound on
Pick shawnnas ass from up off the ground holmes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(Shawnna)
I wish a mothefucker would try to come test a bitch
In the back ty's niggaz wanna base a bitch
It's them Cadillac trucks and them lexesus
And cant none you niggaz stand next to this

[I-20]
Drug dealer legend in my own time
Nike signs happy faces and the whole nine
Pop pills pop pussy poppin crist nigga
Lil fate I double ludacris nigga

[Tity Boi]
I'm like fuck everysingle free-throw
Even tho I might nigga wit a pink toe
The game is fast but the cash is slow
Why they wanna come to tit like he know

[Shawnna]
You go down the block in that black 6-4
Smoking that stuff in the pack that tit bought
Project niggaz with project flow
Slum ass niggaz wit them slum ass hoes

[Chorus]
