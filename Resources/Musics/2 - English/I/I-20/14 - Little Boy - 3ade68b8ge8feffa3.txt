LITTLE BOY

Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,
Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,

[I-20:]
What's the deala, dominater, why ya squad get dominated, 
They ain't shit
They ain't sayin shit, they talking constipated, dude 
It ain't that complicated
I ain't gotta contemplate it, I am married to this money, 
I can't wait to consummate it
I date it like I hate it, pass it once 
I'm smashin, movin boulders of that snow
We gon turn this bitch to aspen, straight up execution fashion, 
I will murk em,
I will lose you, I am built for this shit, 
And they don't make em like they used to
I'm a fool, I'm a beast, I'm a animal, 
A monster, hit em with a hundred chapels
Like I got the code of contra, 
Oh I got that ruger pointed straight at your mudula
Bet I get a hand in my face, 
Cause nigga I'm a shooter, ask the lord for forgiveness
Ask my daddy for his blessin,
 Might not get another chance,
Ain't no time for second guessin, 
Why the fuck these niggas testing, mista bobby said I'm made,
Niggas actin like their bitches, ya'll squad full of tranny's

Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,
Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,

[ludacris:]
I order all of ya'll to sit ya'll ass down, I'm the winner by decision,
And ya'll just missed the last round, hear that bitch in the back,
Yea that's the fat lady singin, dance with the devil, 
Get smacked by a demon, you can't blame nobody else
It's yourself that ya do it to, jumped to whoevers hot, 
Switch ya sides like a rubiks cube
Ya'll niggas trifalon, you'll never be a leader, 
Your life is worth what I made off a verse with justin bieber,
I'm a force to be reckon with, drink for the heck of it,
Stay at number one, ain't for that comin all in second shiit,
Meanwhile you niggas all in last place, so do like 
Shaquille o' neil, and tell me how my ass tastes, 
I'll be dunkin on these rappers
Tally up my flows, 
I be crossin over bitches, and alley oopin hoes,
I be stealin all ya glory, and shootin all ya pride, 
What's a record like without a little luda on the side, nothin

Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,
Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,

[twista:]
Feel the lightnin n the thunder come down, 
When the sun cloud, everybody better run now,
Shoulda got up undercover somehow, young child, 
Figure you could murder water broke
Come come now, makin it brief as I'm elegant,
 I'm a veteran, and you don't want me turnin you into a skeleton,
Without a murder you can saw my aerial a song 
N that'll be no second thought about 
A motherfucker better than 20 years I been rockin it with luda,
And forever he don been a sharp shooter, 
I-20 getting money from the jumpin,
If a nigga wanna jump in, get the barrel of a steel, 
Barracuda while I'm off a bhudda,
You don't want to bout to end up as a victim, if 
I ever catch you talking I'll apac I knocked I'll knock a nigga off,
It ain't no problem, don't nobody wanna see the thumpin it alone, 
When u clock it and I stop it and gone lil boy,
You can't compete with this style, I'm deep with the vowels, 
A demon I'm wow, freakish, a fowl,
Don't wanna side, with a skull n cross bone, caution, 
To you to keep out the reach of a child,
Got the killers ready for the battle, 
Just incase a nigga wanna shoot, 
Got somebody for ya boss to holla at if a nigga wanna truce.
I don't really think you knew what you was doin 
When you put your foot off up in the arena,
Remember when you was only a misdemeanor, 
Whoopin all you niggas,
I might end up getting served a subpoena, 
Because I'm too wild and true, better gone lil boy,
Cause I'm too fowl for you, 
This here is lyrical molestation, child abuse.

Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,
Little boy, how old are you, little boy, how old are you,
