CATCH A BODY

[Verse 1: I-20]
They asking where the hell I been, I tell em I been right here
Try'na get my buzz back, call me Bobby Light-year
All we do is write here, tell em we in grind mode
Snatch a nigga Rolex and asking where the time goes
Ridin' with my mind blown, pull up in them drops dawg
Girls gone wild style, all you see is tops off
Try'na get these rocks off, tell em that it's snowing nigga
Bricks of that white girl, yeah that Lindsey Lohan nigga
We about that yola nigga, show em how to hold a glock
I paint the perfect picture nigga, all of y'all are Photoshop
Show ya how to hold a knot, teach ya how to tote a glock
Bust a nigga can off his shoulders make his soda pop
Then I gotta go to the spot, yeah we getting richer bitch
Somewhere in the D, giving D to a thicker bitch
Yeah nigga spit is sick; tell em I'm the illest yet
Underground king nigga, tell em I'm the trillest yet

[Hook x4: I-20]
Catch a body nigga!

[Verse 2: Fat Ray]
My nigga
This the realest shit of the day it's 20 and Ray
I take a nigga whole work cycle, throw it away
Like fuck yo bag, lil nigga fuck yo swag
You get the same shit Tony gave Manolo ass
Run in the dow, crying while he lye on the floor
I'm doper than a mop bucket to blow
Pump up the stove, got em fosho, 55 hundred to bow
It gotta be strong on that 4-4 gotta be long
From the same street poverty on I gotta be on
Shit, if not I'm a show em what the dagger do
I be on the block getting gawp with the snagger tooths
Salute real niggas never been a hater
Got stink pink gators touching down at Decatur
Abo gorilla shit, certified street niggas
Kings of the dealership, Big guys iller shit
Double barrel shotgun like they caught Ricky with

[Hook x4: I-20]
Catch a body nigga!
