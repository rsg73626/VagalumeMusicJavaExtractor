SUPERNOVA

[Verse 1:]
Time to let the show begin, time to get this doe again
Rap's Willy Nelson yeah I'm right back on the road again
One week I'm in Amsterdam, next I'm off to Tokyo
Crib in New York City yeah we heading to the broken nose
Every month a different state, everyday a different girl
Party down in Helmand yeah a nigga in a different world
Monday I'm in New Orleans, Tuesday in Seattle nigga
Yeah I'm lift my pivot foot, tell em that I travel nigga
I ain't try'na battle niggas, living in my chattel nigga
Sweet full of troll bread and they try'na sat on niggas
Right back on the stage again, tell em that we...
Smoking on a pack of gas, fueling up the dressing room
Asking where the paper's at, rolling up an extra joint
Tell em that we touching down, we don't need an extra point
Then it's back into the A, where I know they fuckin with me
Anywhere a nigga stay know I got my city with me

[Hook: x2]
Just getting home and I'm right back on the flight again
Hands on the coma guess they try'na take my life again
Say you smoking strong well tell them niggas 
they should light it then
Baby I'm a star, go ahead and let the night begin

[Verse 2:]
Okay she say she got a mouthpiece, catch me out on tour
Find a nigga out on South Beach, dinner at the Forge
I'm try'na hit the Forbes before I'm in the morgue
So you shouldn't knock a nigga when he try'na open doors
I just got home from Singapore; tour it down in London town
Straight back to the Atl, catch me at the underground
Yeah a nigga get around, can't you see I'm super paid?
This ain't even nothing catch me stunning like I'm Super Dave
Stamps on the passport, spend a different currency
Party out in Frankfurt, just head down to Germany
Straight up outta Burnaby, yeah we finna pour
Take the G4 out the... nigga holla at the pore
I'm who they hoping for, even if I open for
Got these bitches out here sweating me you see I open pours
Got no time for might-a-been, see a nigga right again
Baby I'm a star, go ahead and let the night begin

[Hook: x2]
Just getting home and I'm right back on the flight again
Hands on the coma guess they try'na take my life again
Say you smoking strong well tell them niggas 
they should light it then
Baby I'm a star, go ahead and let the night begin
