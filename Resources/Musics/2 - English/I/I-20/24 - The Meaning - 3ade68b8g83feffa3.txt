THE MEANING

[Verse 1:]
You say you hate a nigga, he ain't even get to know me yet
Spores to the victor, I ain't even raise a trophy yet
Saying I ain't knew, but I ain't met a nigga sicker yet
Tell me I should hang it up, but I ain't framed a picture yet
I'm a need a bigger check, know you can't replace of it
You can gamble with'cha life, go ahead and place your bets
None of y'all are fuckin with me; you can't even make a dick
Before you hit the judge of me, let a nigga make his case
All these propaganda son, saying that'cha handing guns
Buddy I'm the best around, call me Bobby Danielson
But I'm more than that force; trust me I got more to say
Bury off of predators, time to dig another grave
I don't know another way, fuck what any other say
Think about it 'fore you say it, live to see another day
Tell me how you want it nigga; we can let the game begin
Let em know I'm running nigga, and I got my second win
Damn

[Hook: x2]
A nigga seen it all
Sometimes I gotta wonder what's the meaning of it all
I really ain't concerned if you believe in me at all
Hope is all I ever given so I gotta give my all

[Verse 2:]
Money over ringtones, they just wanna jiggle from ya
Tell em they can keep the change, 
but they just wanna single from ya
Even though I started out, walking down a different path
You should check the novel out, not just hear the paragraph
Say you want the title now, power like you never felt
Call me Aaron Rodgers now, you can come and see the belt
Yeah I wanna see the wealth, I ain't try'na throw you off
But I can only pay the price, if I think it's worth the cost
Nigga this is poetry, listen and you know it's me
I can feel it closing in on everyone who closest me
Hoping that they notice me, working to be relevant
I'm the nicest nigga out and I'm a make it evident
I'm a make it prevalent, you goin have to see the name
See I got a shooter's touch, and you goin wanna see the reign
I don't need to see the fame; I just wanna hold the cash
See I drink away the pain, so go ahead and pour a glass
Damn

[Hook: x2]
A nigga seen it all
Sometimes I gotta wonder what's the meaning of it all
I really ain't concerned if you believe in me at all
Hope is all I ever given so I gotta give my all
