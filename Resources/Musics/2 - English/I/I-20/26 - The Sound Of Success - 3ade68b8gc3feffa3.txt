THE SOUND OF SUCCESS

[Verse 1:]
Catch a bitch, catch a lick, fuck around and catch a body
Bobby is the shit anywhere, I fuck a porter potty
Naw I ain't cha ordinary, I'm a make ya obvious
I'm married to this money, we committed a monogamous
Plus we living prosperous, dope boys anonymous
We out here doing numbers, 
tell them niggas they can count on us
As long as niggas doubting us, there's alot and in the bury
Murder every fuckin' beat, welcome to the cemetery
Killer run the game Here and ye ain't gotta hope to win
Ain't no fuckin Bcs, can't nobody coach you in
You ain't got a note to spin, show me what'chu making then
I'm a have to break em off, right before I break em in
I swear these niggas made a ten; I don't think they got the heart
You say your life's a movie but I don't think you got the part
I been here from the fuckin' start, I be here when it starts to end
What goes around comes around, wait until it starts to spin

[Hook:]
This is what success feel like, real life
Real talk, ten years deep, and a nigga still nice
Still buss a muotherfucker head for the right price
Real nigga, show these other niggas what my life's like

[Verse 2:]
They don't wanna see me grinding nigga, 
out here getting mo checks
But I ain't try'na hang it up, so nigga fuck a coat check
Dealer give it to you raw, shawty that mean no cut
Catch a nigga on the block, but I ain't finna post up
Welcome to the real grind, I show up at the field mine
Eat em season live nigga, this is Epic Meal Time
Nobody finna peal mine, I ain't try'na take a L
Black Friday bruckin' nigga, I'm just try'na make a sale
I'm just try'na make this mail, I'm just try'na make it hell
They say I got it for the streets, so I'm just try'na make it hell
I'm just try'na make it work, nothing you can tell me nigga
They say I got the city lock, and I don't need a celly nigga
I ain't try'na rush it either, to tell you all the truth about it
They saying that my time has passed, but I made a future at it
Ain't no competition either, can't do nothing for us now
The sound of success nigga, you can play the chorus now

[Hook:]
This is what success feel like, real life
Real talk, ten years deep, and a nigga still nice
Still buss a muotherfucker head for the right price
Real nigga, show these other niggas what my life's like
