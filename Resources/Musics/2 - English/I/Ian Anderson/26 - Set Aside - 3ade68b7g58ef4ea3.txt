SET ASIDE

Hard black crows bobbing where once ran deep furrows. 
Frazzled oak silhouetted in her ivy dress. 
Winter sun catches dog fox through thin hedges: 
throws his long shadow north to the emptiness. 
Farmhouse in tatters; shuttered and battered. 
Even lovers don't go there these last few years. 
Spider-web windows on set-aside heroes 
standing lost in a landscape of tears.
