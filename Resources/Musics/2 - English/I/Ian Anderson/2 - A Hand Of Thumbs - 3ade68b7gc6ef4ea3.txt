A HAND OF THUMBS

My hand of thumbs is shaking 
I am so glad to meet you 
All tongue-tied and twisted 
My lips stuck like glue 

More than a lifetime to say, "How are you?" 
More than an ocean to cross becalmed. 
Less than a second to sink in silence. 
Yours truly, I remain disarmed. 

Saw you peeping from the corner. 
Your eyes seemed to call hello. 
I'm all too easily mistaken, 
My feet unsteady as they go. 

Was I a suave and confident trickster 
I would sweep you up and carry you down 
To raspberry meadows under diamond skies 
and just mess around. 
Just mess around.
