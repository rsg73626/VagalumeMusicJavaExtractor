TOAD IN THE HOLE

I walk along the strand 
to catch the late ride home. 
Shuttle through the evening gloom 
knowing I forgot to phone. 
The back door's open. 
There's a chill blowing in. 
Take your warm hands off me. 
Let the night begin. 
Shush your mouth. 
Listen to me. 
I won't say nothing -- 
Just let me be your 
Toad in the Hole. 
Kicking through the wet leaves lying 
all along the station road. 
Past tired graffitti wailing, 
raw emotion to unload. 
There's coal in the fireplace 
and money in the bank too. 
Deep-pile carpets, tinsel wallpaper. 
Still got the back room to do. 
Don't be late. 
Got a day's work behind me. 
Feel a little devastated 
but my nights are assigned 
to you. 
No tom-cat creeping, now 
could ever be so bold 
to hang around our place tonight 
when I come in from the cold. 
There's a straight-six in the garage 
and some fine wine to cool. 
Labour-savers in the kitchen, 
room in the garden for a pool. 
Shush your mouth. 
Let imagination run 
here in bed-sit heaven 
where all the best wishing's done 
to warm Toad in the Hole.
