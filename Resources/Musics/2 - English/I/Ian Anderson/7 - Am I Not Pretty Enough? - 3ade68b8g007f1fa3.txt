AM I NOT PRETTY ENOUGH?

Am i not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do i cry too much?
Am i too outspoken?
Don't i make you laugh?
Should i try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?

I live, i breathe, i let it rain on me,
I sleep, i wake, i try hard not to break,
I pray, i love, i've waited long enough,
I try as hard as i can.

I laugh, i feel, i make believe it's real,
I fall, i freeze, i pray down on my knees,
I hope, i stand, i take it take like a man,
I try as hard as i can.

Through me?
Why do you see, why do you see, why do you see right

Through me?

Through me?
