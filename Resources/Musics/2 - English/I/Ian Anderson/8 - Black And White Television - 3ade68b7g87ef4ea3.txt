BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION

I looked in the mirror then 
saw my face in a dream. 
With eyes sharp as diamonds 
Blessed with clear vision 
Things were not as they seemed 
Black and White Television 
stared back from the wall. 
Is that my life? 
Am I here at all? 
Down in the High Road, see 
motor cavalcades glide 
past shopwindow dressers 
desperately covering 
all the parts they can hide. 
Black and White Television 
stares at me again. 
Is that their lives? 
Even dummies pretend. 
The truth is so hard to deny. 
The answer is here 
The screen never lies. 
Black and White Television. 
It's the right television. 
Show me it's all a dream tonight. 
The boys on the corner sulk 
in their Suzuki haze. 
In primary colours 
(each year more startling) 
but they still fade to grey 
on Black and White Television. 
It's sweeping the land. 
Is that your life? 
Do you understand? 
Black and White Television 
Back the right television 
Black and White Television 
Hard to fight television 
Show me it's all a dream 
tonight.
