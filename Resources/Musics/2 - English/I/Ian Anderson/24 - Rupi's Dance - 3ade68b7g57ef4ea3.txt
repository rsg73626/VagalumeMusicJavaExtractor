RUPI'S DANCE

She dances through the flower-filled room 
Sea-green eyes a-sparking. 
Or are they blue? 
The message clear: 
Seduce the master, winking. 

Dainty feet circles inscribe 
Upon the frozen parquet. 
Arabesque in compound time: 
Stately Pavane or Bour√©e. 

Sultry smile, come hither gaze 
Black hair softly shining. 
Calls me up to half-lit bed. 
Sweet cloud with golden lining. 

Oh, so young with ageless smile 
Born of ungodly maker 
Draws me: moth to candle bright 
Fiery pleasure-seeker. 

She dances through the flower-filled room 
Sea-green eyes a-sparking. 
It's Rupi's dance: the message clear. 
Her movement does the talking.
