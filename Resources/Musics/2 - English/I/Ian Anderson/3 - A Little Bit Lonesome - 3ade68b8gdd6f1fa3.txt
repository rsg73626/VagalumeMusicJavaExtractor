A LITTLE BIT LONESOME

I'm a little bit lonesome
I'm a little bit blue
I can't stop crying
Since I lost you
There's a pain in my heart
Like a lightening bolt
I'm a little bit lonesome
It's all your fault

Well everytime I wake up, I got you rolling in my head
Your eyes are lookin' at me but they're seeing her
instead
I've got a big fat broken heart with a pain
Sharper than a steel-plated knife
We thanks to you these lonely blues
Are the best things in my life

Well the last time that I saw you she had hold of your
hand
You waved across the street at me so I turned away and
ran
When I got home I got a honktonk song
I played it til my eyes went red
I grabbed a glass I said â€œkiss my assâ€
