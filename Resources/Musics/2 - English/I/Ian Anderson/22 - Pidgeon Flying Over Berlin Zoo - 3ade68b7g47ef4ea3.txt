PIDGEON FLYING OVER BERLIN ZOO

I'm thinking free - like the bird 
flying over, over the animals in the zoo. 
How do you do? 
What's it like to be in there? 
Think about it. 

You're locked behind wires. 
Safe and warm - under house arrest protection 
From the wild, wild storm and tempest 
Raging here on the outside. 
Think about it. 

Pigeon I. 
Pigeon toed. 
I'm pigeon-friendly as pigeons go. 
Pigeon lonely. 
Pigeon English. 
What's it like to be in there? 
Think about it. 

Harsh spaces. 
Empty freedom. 
Scary concept. 
Wrong side of the window. 
Which one of us will wake 
Imprisoned come tomorrow? 
Think about it. 

Give it due consideration. 
Weigh it up. 
Kiss me quickly. 
Pigeon friendly. 
Let me in there to be with you. 
Mull it over. 
(Think about it.)
