TRAINS

Here I am at the end of the day 
with a cup of cold coffee 
from the station buffet. 
On Trains, on Trains I seem 
to spend my life on Trains. 

See the blue suit banker in the ticket line. 
Got an Evening Standard with Playboy 
hidden behind. 
On Trains, on Trains he seems 
to spend his life on Trains. 

Time after time 
Was I just dreaming? 
Did I help you aboard. 
Full passenger service 
Let me help with the door 
Sit down take the weight off your feet. 
There's a train-load of people I'd like 
you to meet 

On Trains, on Trains we love 
to spend our lives on Trains. 
Join the secret world of Trains. 

Feel the pleasure. 
Touch the pain. 
Drift into yesterday. 
Once and again 
I was just thinking. 
We could meet sometime 
on the 17.30 where 
I usually find 
my friends at the end of the day. 
May we pay your fare, lady? 
We should like you to stay 
in our train. 
On Trains you'll have to spend your life 
on Trains. 

I hear there's an office party on the 18.05 
You'll be home for Christmas if they 
take you alive from the Train 
Those Trains, we have to spend our lives 
on Trains. 
Once and again 
I was just thinking 
we could meet any time 
on number two platform 
where I usually find 
my friends at the end of the day 
on Trains, Trains, Trains.
