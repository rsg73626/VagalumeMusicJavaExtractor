USER-FRIENDLY

Do we inhabit some micro-space 
And interface through wires. 
Dance on a printed circuit board 
Throw the software to the fires. 
My memory is slim -- so volatile 
But I'm learning. 
Plug yourself in. 
Stay for awhile 
Un-discerning. 
And on dusty terminals 
Finger me lightly do. 
And QWERTY is the name of love 
Printed on the V.D.U. 
Cut yourself free. 
We're all alone communicating.
