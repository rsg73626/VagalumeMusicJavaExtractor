OLD BLACK CAT

My old black cat passed away this morning 
He never knew what a hard day was. 
Woke up late and danced on tin roofs. 
If questioned "Why?" answered, "Just because." 

He never spoke much, preferring silence: 
Eight lost lives was all he had. 
Occasionally sneaked some Sunday dinner. 
He wasn't good and he wasn't bad. 

My old black cat wasn't much of a looker. 
You could pass him by ? just a quiet shadow. 
Got pushed around by all the other little guys. 
Didn't seem to mind much ? just the way life goes. 

Padded about in furry slippers. 
Didn't make any special friends. 
He played it cool with wide-eyed innocence, 
Receiving gladly what the good Lord sends. 

Forgot to give his Christmas present. 
Black cat collar, nice and new. 
Thought he'd make it through to New Year. 
I guess this song will have to do. 

My old black cat... 
Old black cat...
