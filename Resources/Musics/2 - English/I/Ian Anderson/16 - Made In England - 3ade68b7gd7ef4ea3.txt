MADE IN ENGLAND

Somewhere in a town in England 
lay a babe with a curious smile. 
He was of your father's children. 
Born each side of a dry-stone mile. 
He grew up through the schools and factories, 
Brunel's tunnels and bridges bold. 
Grey towers built high on that Kingdom 
with apartments still unsold. 
Somewhere in a town in England. 
Could be Newcastle, Leeds or Birmingham. 
And were you made in 
England's green and pleasant land. 
He accepts no unemployment 
and is to indeterminate station bred. 
Is possessed of skills and reason 
Flies the flag upon his head. 
Watches the democratic process 
grind it's way through the Commons cold 
Filled with fiery infiltrators 
who would pave the streets with England's gold.
