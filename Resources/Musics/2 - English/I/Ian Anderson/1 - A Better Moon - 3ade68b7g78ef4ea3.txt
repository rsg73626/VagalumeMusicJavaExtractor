A BETTER MOON

I see you better now, shaded in deeper blue. 
Hardly needing to carry the find-your-way lamp 
down to the river. 
Tonight flies a better moon. 
Sad water buffalo lie fast near the shallows; 
a splash revealing the fly-catching fishes. 
Dark Gods silently watching. 
Tonight flies a better moon. 

I guess you've known lovers here, compliant in passion; 
softly laid in the old reed bed, harshly 
lit in the noon sun. 
Tonight flies a better moon. 

Now cloaked in this milky light, new as the virgin dawn, 
shrouded sweetly in all kinds of mystery, 
you turn, smile and then are gone. 
Tonight flies a better moon.
