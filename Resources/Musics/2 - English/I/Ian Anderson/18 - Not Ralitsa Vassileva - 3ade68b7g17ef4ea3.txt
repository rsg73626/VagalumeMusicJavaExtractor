NOT RALITSA VASSILEVA

Dinner table chattering classes 
Tell all we need to know. 
Like it. 
Lump it. 
Dig it. 
Dump it ? on your late, late show. 

And do you think you're Ralitsa Vassileva? 
You're just hand-me-down news in a cookie jar. 
It's a long way from here to CNN in America 
And a red-eyed opinion too far. 

Dish the dirt or dish the gravy. 
Spill the beans to me. 
Sinking fast in terminal boredom 
Feigned interest flying free. 

And do you think you're Ralitsa Vassileva etc. 

Talking monkey, 
Breaking news junkie, tragedies to reveal. 
Light and breezy, up-beat squeezy, 
Close in to touchy-feel. 

Pass the Merlot, dance the three-step 
Cut to a better chase. 
Align yourself with no proposition 
and simpler thoughts embrace. 

Let's talk about me. 
Let's talk about you. 
In a world of private rooms. 
Hide awhile from dark stormbringers 
Sad messengers of doom. 

Sadly, you can't be Ralitsa Vassileva etc. 

And do you think you're Ralitsa Vassileva etc.
