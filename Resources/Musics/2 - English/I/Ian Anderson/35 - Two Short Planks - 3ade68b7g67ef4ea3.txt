TWO SHORT PLANKS

Find some way to square the circle. 
Feet slipping, sliding on the level. 
Connect to reason, is there anybody there? 
Drum it in to me now if you dare. 

Triangles by Isosceles. 
Principles by Archimedes. 
Amo, amas; even amat 
Make for one less way to skin the cat. 

Two short planks 
Try my luck on another day 
Must be thick as 
Two short planks 
That's about all that I have to say. 

Two short planks 
Pop the question: I sit the test 
Must be thick as 
Two short planks 
Spin me round till I come to rest. 

They say truth comes flooding if you let it. 
But what happens if I just don't get it? 
I'm blissful in my sweet ignorance 
And delight in my incompetence. 
Two short planks 
Try my luck on another day 
Must be thick as two short planks 
That's about all that I have to say. 
Two short planks 
Pop the question: I sit the test 
Must be thick as two short planks 
Spin me round till I come to rest.
