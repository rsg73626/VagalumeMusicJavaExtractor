PHOTO SHOP

A Morris Minor, a caf√© noir 
Banana smoothie, snails in a jar. 
Three dodgy sailors, a girl on skates 
A little too muscled from doing weights. 

A family wedding, a sushi bar 
Sand in the Seychelles, karaoke star. 
Lads on the razzle get lost in love. 
Paddington station, rain clouds above. 

The crumpled sheets of a long hot summer. 
Stored images like an acorn, drop. 
Squirreled away, but still remembered 
By the man in the photo shop. 

Rush hour on Praed Street: behind the glass 
A picture process, in one hour fast. 
Intimate portraits of topless wives 
Flashed indiscretions: snap-happy lives.
