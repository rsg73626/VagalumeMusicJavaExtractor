END GAME

I'm slipping into grey. 
And I was (in my way) good to you. 
And you were good for me. 
Bye Bye my love. 
Going to play the End Game. 
It's growing kind of still. 
You know there always will be a dream 
waiting for you when 
sleep comes around. 
I had to play the End Game. 
Bless us all. I must say 
it was good, you know. 
Keep me in mind for 
a re-match in warm snow. 
The faces at the door 
couldn't have looked more lost to see 
me waving as I brush 
away a tear. 
Gone to play the End Game.
