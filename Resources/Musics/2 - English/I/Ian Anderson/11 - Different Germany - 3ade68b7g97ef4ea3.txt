DIFFERENT GERMANY

The lights are down in Germany 
and Germany is closed to me 
different somehow this time. 

The airport's still, cold corridors 
ring empty beats through hollow feet 
that I find to be mine. 

Different Germany. 
History repeats somehow. 
Different Germany. 

Afraid to know you now. 
And past my eyes with leathered gaze 
stare clean-cut boys all dressed as men 
in sharpened uniform. 

Who turned the clock? (Moved on or back) 
and what dark chill is gathering still 
before the storm. 

Out in the street a tableau double-glazed 
with laughing girls whose fastened smiles 
are clearly not meant for me.
