A WEEK OF MOMENTS

A week of moments ? a clutch of days 
Ten thousand minutes of a Passion Play. 
Medley of quavers informs the tune. 
It's all too much: over all too soon. 

Sweet condensation on chilling wine 
Traveler's palm, flamboyant tree 
Fast photos ripped and lost consign 
A week of moments to faint memory. 

A week of moments plucked from the page 
Found far horizons, a sunset stage. 
Suitcases bulge, in silence packed 
A chapter closed: no looking back. 

The lightest touch upon my arm 
No fierce restraint, no call to stay. 
Hushed room maids glide like pawns to king 
With pool attendants in chess piece array.
