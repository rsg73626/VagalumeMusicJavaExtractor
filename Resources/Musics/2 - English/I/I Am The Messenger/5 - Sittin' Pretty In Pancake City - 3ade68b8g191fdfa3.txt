SITTIN' PRETTY IN PANCAKE CITY

This is where I'll always be
Don't forget me, just don't forget me
This is where I will always be
Your sincerity destroyed me

This is killing me, I promise, you're killing me.
Please explain your method because it all seems like madness right now.
And I can't feel your lips between my teeth
But I still taste the blood inside my cheek.

I am the coward that hides behind his anger
You are the light revealing the true me
Worn thin- stretched to the brink of tearing
Send me a message, throw me a line
I found the body and the blood trail
We're running out of time...

This is where I will always be
Don't forget me, don't forget me
Just pull the plug, pull the plug and watch me suffer
I swear this place is killing me
The light is gone but strangely I feel comfort

They said there were plans drawn up for a last minute rescue
But my faith has drifted off to sleep
Wake me up, drag me out of bed quickly now
Don't let me down again
Would you believe your stories are the medication I need?

This is where I will always be
Don't forget me, don't forget me
Just pull the plug, pull the plug and watch me suffer
I swear this place is killing me
The light is gone but strangely I feel comfort

Its terrifying... your confidence in dying
It feels so cut-throat, this competition's cut-throat.
I don't want to fight eternity alone
Just pull the plug
Now watch me suffer
The light is gone, but strangely I feel comfort
