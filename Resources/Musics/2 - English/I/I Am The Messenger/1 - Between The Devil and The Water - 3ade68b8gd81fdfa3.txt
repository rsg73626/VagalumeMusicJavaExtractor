BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE WATER

And when everything you loved is falling through your fingertips
The thought of holding you is a constant haunting bliss.
It's not a dream, this reduntant life that you lead.
Got to push on through, push on through
It can't get worse from here.

It seems like I pull myself together to only fall apart
I need you now to see me through because I can't stand alone.
You are the pillar of my confidence, my character
Foundation of my heart

When everything you believe is slowly fading, and you feel you need a break.
There's one final objective that I have yet to reach
I will stand up and take a step towards the end.

It seems like I pull myself together to only fall apart
I need you now to see me through because I can't stand alone.
You are the pillar of my confidence, my character
Foundation of my heart


Looking up at the dawning horizon, you fall to your knees and see
Looking up at the dawning horizon, you fall to your knees and see

In the sky, there is a floating kiosk ever watching the progressive world.
