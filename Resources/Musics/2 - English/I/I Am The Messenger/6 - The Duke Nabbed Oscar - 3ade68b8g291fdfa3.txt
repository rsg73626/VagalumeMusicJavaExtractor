THE DUKE NABBED OSCAR

I've been longing for a sign to show me what fate will bring me
There's this shining light blinding my eyes.
Baby this is it! This is it!
I'd like to see you stop me, there's only one way out.
Now come on, what are you waiting for?

There'll come a day when we will know the way
We'll live our lives the way we should be

Oh my God, we're taking two steps forward and three steps back.
We're going under, we're doing down.
Things have got to change if we want to stick around

There'll come a day when we will know the way
We'll live our lives the way we should be

I'll tell you this, there's not a chance I wont take
My heart's my sword, you can't say a thing that will make it break.
This is my life, you can't take that away.
And I know that I'll make it one day.

There'll come a day when we will know the way
We'll live our lives the way we should be
