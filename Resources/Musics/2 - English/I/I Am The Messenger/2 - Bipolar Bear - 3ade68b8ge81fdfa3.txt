BIPOLAR BEAR

I believe in unity
This separation's killing us away
This is the time, this is the place
The stage we play is where the plot is made, so come on!
This is the price we pay for making our own destiny.
We've been playing God for far too long, and now we're
Breaking away

I've always believed that there's more to this story than you've been leading on

The star ocean's waiting, we can't go and let her down.
For once I have strength in my own judgment.
With wings like these, we will turn around.
We have to stop this, we have to stop this.

Can't you see what's happening?
This isolation is everything I see.
These lights are bright as ever
Yet we choose to close our eyes.
And avoid laying sight upon this population sacrifice.

For once, we need to clean our slate.
We need to clean our slate

Breaking away, breaking away.
There's more to this game.

The star ocean's waiting, we can't go and let her down.
For once I have strength in my own judgment.
With wings like these, we will turn around.
We have to stop this, we have to stop this.
