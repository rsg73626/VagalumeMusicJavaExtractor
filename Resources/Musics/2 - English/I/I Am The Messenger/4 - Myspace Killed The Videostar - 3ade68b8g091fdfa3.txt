MYSPACE KILLED THE VIDEOSTAR

You know you have a problem when you feel this weak
These words are choking me, I need to breathe.
You know you'll never solve them, you made a choice
There's no escaping this, your opinion's voiced.
We're standing here, staring

Off into the distance
Fearful of a world without you
It's a world I can't adapt too.
Off into the distance
Fearful of a world without you
It's a world I can't adapt too.

There's a point in time when we need to decide
Is this the life you want to live?

Off into the distance
Fearful of a world without you
It's a world I can't adapt too.
Off into the distance
Fearful of a world without you
It's a world I can't adapt too.

So we say goodbye to everything we fought for, for all we fought to love
Now the battle stands in understanding how you did this to me.

What can be the outcome, of us going nowhere?
