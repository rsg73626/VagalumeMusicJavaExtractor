YEAH BUT WHAT IF SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR

Listen up, come and hear my story
Another child has been torn today
Due to his faith and love
In everything, and everyone

And we've tried so hard to understand. What have we done?
You'll see, the destruction and chaos in the world we know.
The world we feel we're owed.

Let's not get carried away, let's not get carried away!
Get off the ground! You're not dead yet,
Overrun by the demons you went to bed with
Raise you're hands up! There's nothing that you should be ashamed of.
Get off the ground! You're not dead yet
Over-run by the demons you went to bed with!
We've all fallen to the bottom

There's a look in your eyes reminding me that we'll never make it out alive.
And the taste in my mouth is one of destruction and doubt.
We're running out of time.

Let's not get carried away, let's not get carried away!
Get off the ground! You're not dead yet,
Overrun by the demons you went to bed with
Raise you're hands up! There's nothing that you should be ashamed of.
Get off the ground! You're not dead yet
Over-run by the demons you went to bed with!
We've all fallen to the bottom

Here we'll stand
Here, take our hands!
