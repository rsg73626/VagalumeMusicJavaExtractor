AEROBICS

For the first time let your body go tonight.
We were eighteen, we made a mistake.
We were eighteen, we made a mistake.
You taste like a mistake, babe.

For the first time let your body go tonight.
I take short breaths, I take short breaths.
I'm waiting for the shock.

The lights go down and we are left alone.
Baby found her way home.

For the last time let your body go.
Baby found her way home.
