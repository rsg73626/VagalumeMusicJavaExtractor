NEUZEIT

She does a shadow dance
Does a shadow dance with me
I can see our shapes across the wall
I know she carries scars
We all carry scars don't we?
Lick your wounds and stand tall

Let's do this cliche
Or make a new cliche

Und das ist die neue geschichte

She moves her lips and I get butterflies
But we still don't speak the same language
It's not just robots and autobahns
That have got me feeling attracted

Let's do this stereotype
Or make a new stereotype

Und das ist die neue geschichte

Girl, be like marlene
Stand up for yourself
There's nothing more sad
Than an angel without light
This is the neuzeit

Und wir machen neue geschichte
