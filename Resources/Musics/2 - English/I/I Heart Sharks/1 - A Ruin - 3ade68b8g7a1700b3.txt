A RUIN

It's friday night and I am alone
In a derelict club and I want to go home
But then I see a face from a long time ago
It wakes me up from my half-drunk low

I pull myself up to follow this ghost
And wait next door whilst she powders her nose
But then I hear the voice of some other boy
I can't see how this girl got so old

Sarah, you've got me going backwards
Losing my reputation for being heartless
But I'll lie next to you in the hospital
Keep you sane between these white walls

I never thought I'd see you broken
So long since we'd spoken
We were young back then
But I've never seen a ruin like you before
Never seen a wreck so beautiful

Look at this mess
What will your parents say?

Oh Sarah, I don't know where to begin
Too many nights spent on Ketamine
Or anything you could get your hands on
You spend your hours in Mitte cafes
Discussing Frida Kahlo and wasting days
Reading dull magazines
Who's in and who's out
You're a model but you don't sieh gut aus
