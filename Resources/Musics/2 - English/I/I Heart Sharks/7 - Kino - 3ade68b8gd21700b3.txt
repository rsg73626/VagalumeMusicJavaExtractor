KINO

An eighties horror film
With us as the heroes in
We'd get lost
But you're still safe with me
Watching films on Gdr Tv
We're not going to get lost

If the thing is coming
I'm going to keep running
I slip sweat fall

I am no hero
And you are no heroine
But we're not going to get lost
The static is a time machine
Pushing pixels into your bad dreams
But we're not going to get lost
