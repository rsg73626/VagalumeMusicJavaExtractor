ANIMALS

If we run through the streets,
Suburban drama beneath our feet,
We see our breath in the air,
Whilst everybody else sleeps.

We're taking sidepaths,
Jumping fences into backyards.
This newspeak's getting me numb,
This newspeak's getting me numb.

You said, you read, we're being watched by cameras,
We're being watched by animals.

We dream of roads made of laughter,
And of "happily ever after",
We make our shadows move faster,
Watch my shadow move faster.

So I'll pull up my hood and start a fight,
I'll pull up my hood and start a fight.

My love, my love, let's pull the alarm.
