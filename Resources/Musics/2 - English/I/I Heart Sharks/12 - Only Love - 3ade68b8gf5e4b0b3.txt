ONLY LOVE

Not sure where it started from
But there's this fear that comes
When our voices go low

So stop this young heart
Running from the start
When love's writ in stone
Well, being alone no it never got me hurt
So frightened to commit but what I heard
Is it's only love
It's only love
It's only love

So slow down, yeah stop a second
Cause in this jet black night
All we've got is time

I'll stay a while cause you own me now
I forgot to feel but you can show me how
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
Your hands to catch me when I fall
To stop and tell me when I know it all
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love

I've watched you getting close
Felt fear creep in my bones
But this time I might let you in
My insecurities
I don't wear them on my sleeve
But you've got those eyes that undress me

So slow down, yeah stop a second
Cause in this jet black night
All we've got is time

I'll stay a while cause you own me now
I forgot to feel but you can show me how
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
Your hands to catch me when I fall
To stop and tell me when I know it all
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love (x2)

I've watched you getting close
Felt fear creep in my bones
But this time I might let you in
It's only love
