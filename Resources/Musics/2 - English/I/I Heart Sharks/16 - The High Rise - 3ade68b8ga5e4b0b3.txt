THE HIGH RISE

You said: "meet me somewhere
Between england and berlin
Leave the high rise
And head to red brick
Be a man, let life begin"
You took us to the top floor
So we could see better
And I got tongue-tied
When I thought of something clever
And then
Under a northern sky
You swore you were happy here
Stood on the edge of forever
Stood on the edge of forever
Getting older by your side
Well that's the plan, my dear
Stood on the edge of forever
Stood on the edge of forever
Up here, I feel the distance
Between us and the lives below
Trace the cranes on the horizon
And see the airport lights aglow
And I can hear a noise
In my head from the pressure
Wathing the dusk from the roof together
And then
Under a northern sky
You swore you were happy here
Stood on the edge of forever
Stood on the edge of forever
Getting older by your side
Well that's the plan, my dear
Stood on the edge of forever
Stood on the edge of forever
And walking home I remember
Under a northern sky
You swore you were happy here
Stood on the edge of forever
Stood on the edge of forever
Growing older by your side
Well that's the plan, my dear
We're on the edge of forever
We're on the edge of forever
