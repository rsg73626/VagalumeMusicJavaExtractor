REYKJAVIK (STAY HERE)

It's three o'clock, and still light
The sun hangs low on a summer night
Apathetic to the passers-by
Just two happy faces on a photograph
A change of light, it caught your eye
A cloud of ash in a static sky
Since we woke up we lost our fear of the dark
I promised you we'd come here someday
So hold on, hold on
It feels like we've been here in another life
So this time we'll stay here
Stay here
I'm shaking through, like dynamite
People pointing at explosions
You smiled at me
"there are worse ways to die
Than in reykjavik in the summertime"
Since we woke up we lost our fear of the dark
I promise you we'll both me ok
So hold on, hold on
It feels like we've been here in another life
So this time we'll stay here
Stay here
I haven't slept for days and my head's a mess
But with my world in your arms it matters less
So this time we'll stay here
Stay here
Since we woke up we lost our fear of the dark
I promised we'd come here, come here
So hold on
It feels like we've been here in another life
So this time we'll stay here
Stay here
I haven't slept for days and my head's a mess
But with my world in your arms it matters less
So this time we'll stay here
Stay here
