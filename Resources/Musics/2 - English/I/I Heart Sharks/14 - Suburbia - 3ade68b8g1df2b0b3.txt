SUBURBIA

If you're bored of Suburbia (x3)
Burn down your house, let's dance in the color﻿ of fire
If you're bored of Suburbia (x3)
Burn down your house, le'ts dance in the color﻿ of fire
If you're bored of suburbia (x3)
Watch the go when start, you might get more than you asked for
If you're bored of suburbia (x3)
Go crash your car, make some friends in the hospital bar

Life gets harder so you
Keep swimming though ocean of youth
There's nothing I would rather do than spend years growing with you

But I'm bored of suburbia (x3)
I'm bored of there can which go for miles and miles and miles
I'm so bored of suburbia (x3)
Bored of dead districts which the next to swings and real lives

Life gets harder so you
Keep swimming though ocean of youth
There's nothing I would rather do than spend years growing with you (x2)

Sometimes I think you were right, I wasted my life by waiting so long
I see the couples around town and faces in playground and wish you were wrong
Sometimes I think you were right, I wasted my life by waiting so long
There's miles between me and playgrounds
And dream of a quiet life and a happy home
