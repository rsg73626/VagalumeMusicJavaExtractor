LIES

Please, please, please tell me white lies
Please tell me lies
Because the truth has had me waiting along too many times
You're so much more interesting when you're being untrue
Spin me a web of believe I can fall into

I love when you lie to me

Please, please, please cover my eyes
With fiction tales of parties and guys you've had
But please don't drop your mask girl
I love it so much

If you ask no questions, you'll hear no lies
