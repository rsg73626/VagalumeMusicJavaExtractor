THE WORLD IS YOURS

In hidden places
Beneath the searchlights
We do our waltz
For just tonight

He sings love songs on a casio

A thousand faces
The Berlin twilight
Forget the wall
For just tonight

He sings love songs on a casio

We'll find a place and make love to the sounds
We're the stars
We'll set this town alight
