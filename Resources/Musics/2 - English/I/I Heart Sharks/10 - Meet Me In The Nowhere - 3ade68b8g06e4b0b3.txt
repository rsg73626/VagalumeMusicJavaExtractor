MEET ME IN THE NOWHERE

We want the highlights and not the low-life
We'll take off our old skin
And head down somewhere tropical
A sight for sore eyes - you lying poolside
We're miles beneath the jets
To them we're just dots by the ocean

Is this broken town bringing us both down?
This real life
This real life
Let the city's howl dissappear somehow
This real life
This real life

Take your things and grab your tapes
And we'll skip town together
Meet me in the nowhere
Meet me in the nowhere
Seem like life gets dull sometimes
And you'd like something better
Meet me in the nowhere
Meet me in the nowhere

You want the highlights
And not the low-life
You've seen maps in magazines
And cut out future destinations
Until that time we'll let the sunlight
Warm concrete beneath our feet
And stare at pictures on a postcard

Is this broken town bringing us both down?
This real life
This real life
Let the city's howl dissappear somehow
This real life
This real life

Take your things and grab your tapes
And we'll skip town together
Meet me in the nowhere
Meet me in the nowhere
Seem like life gets dull sometimes
And you'd like something better
Meet me in the nowhere
Meet me in the nowhere

This time next year I'll make it
Worth your while
In real life
In real life
Got it all worked out
I won't let you down in real life
In real life

Take your things and grab your tapes
And we'll skip town together
Meet me in the nowhere
Meet me in the nowhere
Seem like life gets dull sometimes
And you'd like something better
Meet me in the nowhere
Meet me in the nowhere
