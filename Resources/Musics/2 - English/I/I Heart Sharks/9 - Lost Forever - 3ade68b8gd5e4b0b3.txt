LOST FOREVER

Take my hand let's lose some sleep
Stop me fooling inbetween a (?)
Of all the girls I meet
Show me personality

Let's make some bruises I can show
Never let my head hang low never let me
Feel alone love me 'till our hearts explode
I don't wanna go home I just wanna get lost
I wanna get lost forever
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
I don't wanna grow up I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost forever
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
Take me places I don't know
I'm a post teenwreck of flesh and bones
Stop my endless loosing streak
My confidence waa always weak
Let's get high all afternoon
Chase our shadow 'round the room
Change our actions change our names
Never feel the same again
I don't wanna get home I just wanna get lost
I wanna get lost forever
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
I don't wanna grow up
I just wanna get lost
I wanna get lost forever
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
Lost, we're lost forever, lost, lost forever
Lost we're lost forever
Lost they'll be lost for words
