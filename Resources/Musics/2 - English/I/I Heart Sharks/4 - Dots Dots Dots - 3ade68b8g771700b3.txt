DOTS DOTS DOTS

This is how we roll
We've got our masks on tonight
We wear rings of gold
But they're plastic, right?
We hang around with deadbeats
Fucking up our heartbeats with chemicals
And we're dreaming of sleep
But only cause we're told to

So please don't close your eyes
We'll run through the concrete
And dance through the flashlights
Please don't close your eyes
I'm keeping mine open tonight
Sleep is a desease

I dream of sleep
