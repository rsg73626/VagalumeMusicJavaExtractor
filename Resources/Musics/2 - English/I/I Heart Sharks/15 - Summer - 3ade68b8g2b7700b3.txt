SUMMER

You know I'll never gonna let you down, I never
For all these years which have been around, I never
Despite the rivers ... down, I never
You know I'll never gonna let you down, I never, I never

But our lives have grew up, still dreaming of you
The tired eyes, the tired eyes
The moments we grew up, we thinking of you
The tired eyes, the tired eyes

Then others pretend it's summer, others pretend it's summer
Let's just pretend it's summer, let's just pretend it's summer

But our lives have grew up, still dreaming of you
The tired eyes, the tired eyes
The moments we grew up, we thinking of you
The tired eyes, the tired eyes

Then others pretend it's summer, others pretend it's summer
Let's just pretend it's summer, let's just pretend it's summer
Let's just pretend it's summer, let's just pretend it's summer
Let's just pretend it's summer, let's just pretend it's summer
