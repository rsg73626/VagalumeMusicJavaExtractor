KARAOKE

We all get dressed up on a friday night
Girls and boys wear suits and plastic smiles
Something just to show we're still alright
Wipe off the tears
Recall the years
Stars in our eyes

Let's go down to the darkest part of our town
Where we can kill what's been getting us down

(and we're like)

The world's going to hear us now
Singing "ayo, ayo, ayo"
Stars of the underground
Come out of your cages
The world's going to hear us now
Singing "ayo, ayo, ayo"
So tonight
Come out of your cages

There's always some sinatras in the crowd
With a voice like silk
But we just want to shout
Til our voices crack and our lips go dry
I know you're tired
But make my night
Sing it one more time

Let's go down to the darkest part of our town
Where we can kill what's been getting us down

(and we're like)

The world's going to hear us now
Singing "ayo, ayo, ayo"
Stars of the underground
Come out of your cages
The world's going to hear us now
Singing "ayo, ayo, ayo"
Cause tonight
Come out of your cages

Come on
Let's sing the songs
From when we got the message wrong words
Across the screen
Remind us who we used to be

The world's going to hear us now
Singing "ayo, ayo, ayo"
Stars of the underground
Come out of your cages
The world's going to hear us now
Singing "ayo, ayo, ayo"
Cause tonight
Come out of your cages

Come on
Let's sing the songs
From when we got the message wrong words
Across the screen
Remind us who we used to be

Ayo, ayo, ayo
