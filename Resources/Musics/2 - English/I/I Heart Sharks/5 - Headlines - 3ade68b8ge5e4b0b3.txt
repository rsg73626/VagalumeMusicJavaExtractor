HEADLINES

In some faded magazine pages
Was where I first saw your smile
For a minute I was still
Cause you looked so real
The technicolor came to life
The tabloids said you had a lover
A photograph of a kiss in the rain
But I could hold you like no other
If you could feel, you would feel the same
And I need you to need me
I'll get so close so you believe it
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause you and I will make it in the headlines
Make it in the headlines
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause you and I will make it in the headlines
Make it in the headlines
You've seen so many destinations
You've got a place in cannes, paris and rome
A million fans before your stages
An entourage everywhere you go
In your voice, I heard it
Oh, don't you think we'd be so perfect?
So hold tight, we're leaving
We'll make the papers by the evening
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause you and I will make it in the headlines
Make it in the headlines
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause you and I will make it in the headlines
Make it in the headlines
Tell me I'm a liar
Tell me I'm a liar
When I say it looks so right
You and I together in the headlines
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me I'm alive
Tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause you and I will make it in the headlines
Make it in the headlines
