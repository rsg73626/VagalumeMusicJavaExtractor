I WANT YOU AROUND

Can I make the rain drops fall on the desert sand

Can I pick you up and fly you to a wonderland

Can I stop the world from turning just to make the day last

Can I make you smile in the future and forget the past

 

Can you make my heart skip a beat when you hold my hand? 
If you ask me too 
Can you be my soul protector and my number one fan? 
If you ask me too 
Can you be the lead in a movie with aimless cast? 
If you ask me too 
Can you be the one to make me fall in love so fast? 
If you ask me too 

 

 I could spend all day

Tryna tell you

All the ways that i adore you

But I'll simplify and say

 

I want you around

You gotta a smile so gifted

It can disappear a frown

Ooh you got me uplifted every day

I want you around 

I hang on every word you say

I know it's not original or profound

But i want you around

 

Would you steal all the stars out the sky for me (If you ask me to)

Would you fall a thousand miles just fall with me (If you ask me to)

Would you commit a thousand crimes to do with some time with me (If you ask me to)

Would you lie to your family and your friends for me (If you ask me to)

 

I could spend all day

Tryna tell you

All the ways that i adore you

But I'll simplify and say

 

I want you around

You gotta a smile so gifted

It can disappear a frown

Ooh you got me uplifted every day

I want you around 

I hang on every word you say

I know it's not original or profound

But i want you around 

 

Can I make the rain drops fall on the desert sand

Can I pick you up and fly you to a wonderland

(fade to end)
