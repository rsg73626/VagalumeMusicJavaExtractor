I'M NOT COMING WITH YOU

I Dream â€“ Not Coming With You

I just wanna run away and hide from everyone 
I feel so scared incase I fall (I'll catch you if you fall) 
I try to prove to them that I can make it on my own 
So tell me why does it feel so hard today 

I don't wanna waste anymore time 
On something I can't do (You've got nothing to lose) 
So don't try and talk me into it 
Cause I'm not coming with you 

I've always tried to wear my heart on my sleeve 
But now I'm hiding it away (Hiding it away) 
I know my friends always be by my side 
So tell me why does it feel so hard today 

I don't wanna waste anymore time 
On something I can't do (You've got nothing to lose) 
So don't try and talk me into it 
Cause I'm not coming with you 
I don't wanna waste anymore time 
On something I can't do (You've got nothing to lose) 
So don't try and talk me into it 
Cause I'm not coming with you
