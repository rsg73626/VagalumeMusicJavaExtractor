DREAMING

Dreaming, Dreaming Dreaming

Ive been dreaming about a place
Where I can watch you smile as you let sunlight hit your face
And sing if your happy
Cry if your blue
Eat if your hungry 
And love if your true

But baby there's heartache
Roaming this world
Something has gotten hold of us and baby we all hurt
We all try to fight it 
And sometimes we win
As long as your dreaming
You're not giving in


We're Dreaming, yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all around the world
Dreaming yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all round the world now

We all have been wondering
If theres a plan 
Cause sometimes we find the cruelty
too cruel to understand
Honey we're dreaming and thats not a crime
That wounds will be healed with the passing of time
Tell me a story 
I'll sing you a song
Lets make them be about a place where people can belong
Baby there's nothing that I wouldn't do 
To bring them to life and to make them come true

We're Dreaming, yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all around the world
Dreaming yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all round the world now

All around the world now 
All around the world now 


I've been dreaming about a place
Where I can watch you smile as you let sunlight hit your face
And nothing can tear two people a part
A place where its cool to open your heart

We're Dreaming, yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all around the world
Dreaming yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all round the world now

We're Dreaming, yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all around the world
Dreaming yeah yeah yeah yeah
all around the world now, all round the world now
