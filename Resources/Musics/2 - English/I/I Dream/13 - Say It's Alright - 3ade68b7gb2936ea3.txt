SAY IT'S ALRIGHT

Say It's Alright, C'Mon (spoken)

Life has never been logical

You can feel like a criminal

Doing things that are natural

Tell me do you understand?

Everybody's got ups and downs, yeah

Your whole world just turns around

You need somebody to trust in you

When tomorrow comes

 

Living each day

As if it's the last

It's what I should do, but I know

Today has just passed

 

Is it all wrong?

Is it all right?

Is it all black? or is it all white?

Should I turn left? or should I turn right?

Say It's Alright

Is it all wrong?

Is it all right?

Is it all black? or is it all white?

Should I turn left? or should I turn right?

Say It's Alright

 

There is so many points of view

Look at me and look at you

I'm not trying to disapprove

What your saying to me

Just forgot what I'm fighting for

Who remembered to keep the score?

Now I guess I can't afford

To buy a second hand dream

 

Living each day

As if it's the last

It's what I should do, but I know

Today has just passed

 

Is it all wrong?

Is it all right?

Is it all black? or is it all white?

Should I turn left? or should I turn right?

Say It's Alright

Is it all wrong?

Is it all right?

Is it all black? or is it all white?

Should I turn left? or should I turn right?

Say It's Alright

 

Oh...

Yeah

Say It's Alright

 

Living each day

As if it's the last

It's what I should do, but I know

Today has just passed

 

Is it all wrong?

Is it all right?

Is it all black? or is it all white?

Should I turn left? or should I turn right?

Say It's Alright

Is it all wrong?

Is it all right?

Is it all black? or is it all white?

Should I turn left? or should I turn right?

Say It's Alright
