HERE COMES SUMMER

On days like these you can be anyone
Do whatever you want, as long as your having fun
The girls look fly, the guys get the one by one
Well it's a rollercoaster ride but you just gotta take a bit
Guess the word is out, something here to shout about

Oh, oh, Oh, oh
Here Comes Summer (the one that we've been waiting for)
Oh, oh, Oh, oh
Sweet taste of summer (scream it from the corridor)
Our work is on a break, there'll be no more school to take
Cause Here Comes Summer

The radio's blasting out another favourite song
It's just so good to be alive
When all you see is blue in skies
No more rules, no more this and then
Well we'll chillin' in the sun, I feel a party coming on
Oh Yeah
Well the word is out, and everyone's shouting out

Oh, oh, Oh, oh
Here Comes Summer (the one that we've been waiting for)
Oh, oh, Oh, oh
Sweet taste of summer (scream it from the corridor)
Our work is on a break, there'll be no more school to take
Cause Here Comes Summer

Oh, oh, Oh, oh
Here Comes Summer (the one that we've been waiting for)
Oh, oh, Oh, oh
