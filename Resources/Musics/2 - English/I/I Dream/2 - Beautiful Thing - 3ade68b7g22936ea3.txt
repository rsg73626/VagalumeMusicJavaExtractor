BEAUTIFUL THING

I can't sleep 
I can't eat 
Since I met you 
I can't speak 
I get weak 
When I'm with you 
I don't show 
But I know 
You're such a beautiful thing 
Yeah 



I can't talk 
I can't walk 
But I'm flying 
I get lost in my thoughts 
When your smiling 
Cause I feel 
And I see 
You're such a beautiful thing 
Yeah 

 

I can't get my words together 
I can't put this in a letter 
Cause you are 
You are 
You're such a beautiful thing yeah

 

Chorus:
 You're such a, you're such a

Such a beautiful thing

Such a, Such a

Such a beautiful thing

You're such a, You're such a

You're such a beautiful thing

 

All it took was a look 
And I melted 
Kinda shook
Kinda Hooked 
How I felt it 
I'll be fine, when your mine 
You're such a beautiful thing 
Yeah 

 

And if it takes forever 
It's still better late than never 
Cause you are, you are 
You're such a beautiful thing 


 

Chorus:

Such a beautiful thing

Such a, Such a

And oh Wherever you go, I want you to know
Know that my feelings are true, baby baby
