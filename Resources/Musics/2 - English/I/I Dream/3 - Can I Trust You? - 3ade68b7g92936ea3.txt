CAN I TRUST YOU?

Call me whatever, but the past has shown

I’m stronger on my own, don’t need nobody

Don’t wanna make exceptions to the rule

Cause I am no one’s fool, suffering gladly

 

But now I don’t have a choice, inside me there is a voice

That tells me gotta let go, so…

 

Can I trust you, cause I’ve been hurt before

And I can’t take anymore

Can I trust you, show me your honesty

Tell me you promise me the truth

Yeah, yeah, yeah

 

It isn’t easy, cause I wanna fight

But now my hands are tied and I don’t like it

I hate it when there’s nothing I can do

But when I look at you, I get excited

 

Maybe I can do with your help to coax me out of my shell

And help me wanna let go

 

Cause I’m a DJ n' slash producer (Can I trust you)

And I got a real buzz when they introduced her 
(Cause I’ve been hurt before)

Cause I get what I want and I get it real quick, 
if you don’t like the water, then don’t Tom Cruise the ship
(And I can’t take it anymore)

I use metaphors to get across what I’m saying (Can I trust you)

Cause love is a game n' people to be playing 
(Show me your honesty)

It hurts when you lose so you really want to win, 

So be devoted from the end right to the second you begin 
(Tell me, you promise me the truth)

 

Can I trust you, cause I’ve been hurt before

And I can’t take it anymore 

Can I trust you, show me your honesty

Tell me you promise me the truth
