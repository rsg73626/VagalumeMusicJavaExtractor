OUR LIFE

Our Life 
So Tight
 
 
Three become as one
Having Fun
Life's full of possibilities
Got the dream everything in this team
working to what we believe
 
Mirror Mirror, tell us the answer to our prayers
Bringing us together, nothing can compare
 
This is Our Life
We're on a roll, good to go
Sisters hanging so tight
Riding high, looking fly
This is Our Life
Super Queens, living dreams 
Walking side by side
& the crew coming through
Sisters this is our life
 
Day and night 
got a vibe, time to ride
as one by one we hit the road
We'll be strong, holding on
Cause we belong 
always gonna stand by you (and with a little attitude)
 
Mirror Mirror, tell us the answer to our prayers
Bringing us together, nothing can compare
 
This is Our Life
We're on a roll, good to go
Sisters hanging so tight
Riding high, looking fly
This is Our Life
Super Queens, living dreams 
Walking side by side
& the crew coming through
Sisters this is our life
 
Everybody's gonna know my name
Living Dreams
Walking side by side
Nothing's ever gonna be the same
Coming through
Sista's this is our life
 
No one used to understand me, throught that I was just a freak (inside you cried)
Throught that i would be a failure, 
never used to notice me ( you thrived, survived)
But look at us now
 
This is Our Life
We're on a roll, good to go
Sisters hanging so tight
Riding high, looking fly
This is Our Life
Super Queens, living dreams 
Walking side by side
& the crew coming through
Sisters this is our life
 
 
Everybody's gonna know my name
Good to go, sista's hanging so tight
Nothing's ever gonna be the same
This is our life
Everybody's gonna know my name
Living Dreams
Walking side by side
Nothing's ever gonna be the same
Coming through
Sista's this is our life
