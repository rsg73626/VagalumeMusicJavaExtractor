OPEN UP MY HEART

I might, act like I'm so insincere

Pretend like I don't really care, girl

You'd be right to, not believe a word I say

I know, I've said this so many times

I don't even know if there lines, girl

You'd be right to not believe a word I say

 

 I want to show what I'm thinking of you

And you should be mine

I want you, but I don't know how to begin to

Open Up My Heart

 

And now, I feel I must try to explain

Nothing I do feels the same, boy

You'd be right to doubt the words I say

But it's true no one makes me feel like you do

The games I've been playing are through, boy

Now it's time you believe the words I say

 

I want to show what I'm thinking of you

And you should be mine

And I want you, but I don't know how to begin to

Open Up My Heart

 

They used to say he'll never change

One day I'll prove them all wrong

But I gotta let you know, oh, baby

Gotta let you know

 

I want to show what I'm thinking of you

And you should be mine (oh, i want to)

And I want you, but I don't know how to begin to

Open Up My Heart

 

And I want to show what I'm thinking of you (oh, yeah)

I want you, (i want you girl, i really want you) 
(I need you girl, i really need you) 
but i don't know how to begin to 
(cause i w-w-want you, and i n-n-need you)

I want to, (i want you girl, i really want you) 
(I need you girl, i really need you)
show you what I'm thinking of you
(cause i w-w-want you)
