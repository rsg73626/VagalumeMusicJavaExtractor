DON'T STEAL OUR SUNSHINE

Your Sunshine
I, I wanna know 
Why can't you see what you're doing's 
gonna come back and bit you in the butt
I've had enough 
How can you do what you do?
Do you think you can buy me?
 
I, I wanna see
If we can turn this around
And stick together like glue  
You and me 
Cause what happens now could last forever
 
We can't stand by and watch you steal our sunshine, 
Sunshine
I just won't let you take it all away 
Sunshine
So open up your eyes and see
That money doesn't grow on trees
Don't let them take your sunshine away
 
Your Sunshine
 
Stop! and listen up
Don't say a word cause I'm bored of it
We've gotta try and work it out 
Feet on the ground, just walk away from it
Don't be so crazy
 
Now I wanna see
If we can turn this around 
And stick together like glue  
You and me 
Cause what happens now could last forever
I know, what's really going on 
There's no turning back, 
cause once it's gone it's gone
 
We can't stand by and watch you steal our sunshine 
Sunshine
I just won't let you take it all away 
Sunshine
 
We can't stand by and watch you steal our sunshine 
Sunshine
I just won't let you take it all away 
Sunshine
So open up your eyes and see 
That money doesn't grow on trees
Don't let them take your sunshine away
Sunshine
Don't let them take your sunshine away
 
Your Sunshine
