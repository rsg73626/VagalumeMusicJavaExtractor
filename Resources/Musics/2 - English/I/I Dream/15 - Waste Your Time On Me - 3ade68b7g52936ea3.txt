WASTE YOUR TIME ON ME

You know that I've got something special

I feel so lucky to be me, you'll see

Some people say that I'm a princess running wild

But don't waste your time with them, just look into my eyes

 

Cause now you're under my spell and I'm not gonna set you free

But you can hitch a ride on my star

Ya better believe that i want you and you need me

It's time to make some history

So, why'd you have to go and waste your time on her?

Waste your time on me

Yeah, me

Waste your time on me

Yeah, yeah

 

Ah, ah, ah

Some people say that i'm superficial

Ah, ah, But's that a compliment to me

Because...I'd rather be a super something than a boring anything else

Just take one look at me and throw your heart in the wishing well, cause I'm your Jezabel

 

Now I'm under your skin and I'm not gonna set you free

But you can hitch a ride on my star

Ya better believe that i want you and you need me

It's time to make some history 

Why'd you have to go and waste your time on her?

Waste your time on me

Yeah, me

Waste your time on me

Yeah, yeah

Ah, ah, ah

 

Hit the top, you're the first lady

Blow it up cause you're the bomb baby

Break a leg, sing your song lady

Knock 'em dead and bring it on baby

 

I want to save the whale and start a charity

But just as long as I can keep all eyes on me

 

Now your under my spell and I'm not gonna set you free

But you can hitch a ride on my star

Ya better believe that I want you and you need me

It's time to make some history

I'll blow your mind, don't spend your time on D list personalities

Forget the rest, cause I'm the best, turn on the highs and worship me

Why'd you have to go and waste your time on her?

Waste your time on me
