GOODBYE RADIO

It's got me feeling so insecure
I'm tried of acting like I'm so damn sure
And I think they can all just sense the weakness inside of me
Yeah, inside
 
I gotta keep this dream alive
Oh it's Goodbye Radio
I need some help right now
But I can't cry out and let everybody know
That underneath my skin I'm torn and scared 
But I'll keep my feelings in
Or It's Goodbye Radio
 
Tried to keep it all down 
But when I'm talking it feels much safer somehow
Once i was strong but now it all seems to feel so wrong
 
I gotta keep this dream alive
Oh it's Goodbye Radio
I need some help right now
But I can't cry out and let everybody know
That underneath my skin I'm torn and scared 
But I'll keep my feelings in
Oh It's Goodbye Radio
 
It's Goodbye Radio
