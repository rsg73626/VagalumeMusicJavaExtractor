WHY ME

Why me, 
Is this a dream come true 
Why me, 
It's feeling so magical 
Why me, 
Could this be my chance to shine 
win or lose its time to choose 
is this really ment for me 
Why me

I kinda of feel that I'm falling from the sky 
I can't believe it 
The dream I had is over, 
over 
Why me, 
I'm feeling so insecure 
Why me, 
I've lost what I came here for 
Why me, 
So maybe it's time to go 
Win or lose I'm so confused, 
I guess it wasn't to be 
Why me
