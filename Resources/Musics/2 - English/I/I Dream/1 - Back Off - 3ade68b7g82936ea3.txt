BACK OFF

Back Off, get outta of my face

Cause I don't wanna have to stop it and tell you why

Just leave me alone

Shut up, keep it down, I don't wanna hear

I only wish it I could make you all disappear

Just leave me alone

 

Cause I

I don't care what you say

So go home, you're not welcome here today

I don't wanna hurt your feelings

But Back Off, cause i'm doing it my way

There's nothing left for me to do

So go home, cause I'm sick and tired of you

I know that you've got your reasons

But Back Off, cause I'm doing it my way

Back Off, cause I'm doing it my way

 

It's outta hand, why can't you see

I'm trying to tell you, but you're making it hard for me

Just leave me alone

Get lost, cut it out and let me be

There's no excuses for the way that you're pushing me

Just leave me along

 

Cause I

I don't care what you say

So go home, you're not welcome here today

I don't wanna hurt your feelings

But Back Off, cause I'm doing it my way

There's nothing left for me to do

So go home, cause I'm sick and tired of you

I know that you've got your reasons

But Back Off, cause I'm doing it my way

Back Off, cause I'm doing it my way
