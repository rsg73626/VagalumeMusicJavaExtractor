SUNSHINE

Yesterday was a great day and today's shaping up to be another one of those
Tryna live my life the right way
I'm tryna to make it so all of my dreams are haveable
It feels alright when you can say
I feel so good from my head to my toes
I'm sitting pretty come what may
I'll ride the highs and lows
 
Feels so wonderful, 
Riding on the, Riding on the wheel of fortune
 
Just a little bit of Sunshine 
Has made me realize, that a little bit of good time 
Is all I need in my life
Gonna see it as a good sign
It's put the sparkle in my eyes, hope this feeling lasts a lifetime 
Today the rain can't compromise (Today the rain can't compromise)
 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow
I got no need to look back or dwell upon the past
I'm positively up now and make no mistake cause this feeling's gonna last
There's nothing you can do though, my minds made up and this is how I'm gonna feel
Doesn't matter fast or slow
I'll ride the highs and lows
 
Feels so wonderful, 
Riding on the, Riding on the wheels of fortune
 
Just a little bit of Sunshine 
Has made me realize, that a little bit of good time 
Is all I need in my life
All I'm seeing is the good times 
It puts a sparkle in my eyes, hope this feeling lasts a lifetime 
Today the rain can't compromise (No, no, no)
 
I don't want this thing to end,
on today I can depend, to take me where i need to be
And I think you would agree, now I've seen what I could be
I would like for you to see
 
Just a little bit of Sunshine 
Has made me realize, that a little bit of good time 
Is all I need in my life
All I'm seeing is the good times 
It puts a sparkle in my eyes, hope this feeling lasts a lifetime 
Today the rain can't compromise (Today the rain can't compromise)
 
Just a little bit of Sunshine 
Has made me realize, that a little bit of good time 
Is all I need in my life
All I'm seeing is the good times 
It puts a sparkle in my eyes, hope this feeling lasts a lifetime 
Today the rain can't compromise (Today the rain can't compromise)
 
Just a little bit of Sunshine 
Good Time
Good Time
