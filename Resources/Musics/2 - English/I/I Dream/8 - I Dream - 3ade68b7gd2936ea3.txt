I DREAM

What a world

What a life

What a sight for sore eyes

What a chance

What a dream come true

Will I soar

Who can say

Will I fly far away

Tell me will I be over the moon

 

I Dream

Of a wonderful place

I Dream

Though I'm wide awake

To the stars

High above

This is where I wanna be

I Dream

 

Never felt such a rush

And it's almost too much

My poor heart

Beating twice as fast

Full of hope

Full of joy

Wanna scream

Wanna cry

Wanna shout

At the top of my voice

 

I Dream

Of a wonderful place

I Dream

Though I'm wide awake

To the stars

High above

This is where I wanna be

I Dream
