WELCOME TO AVALON HEIGHTS

You know you gotta be tough, 
So pull yourself together 
You gotta make up your mind 
There isn’t anything that you can’t do 

Don’t let go, it’s like a rollercoaster ride 
Take a chance, we got it going on inside 
No regrets
 This ain’t a dress rehearsal 
Welcome to, Welcome to Avalon Heights
 
 
I’ll take you to a place that’ll set you free 
Down in Avalon
I know it’ll blow your mind away 
You gotta believe in yourself now 
Down at Avalon 
So don’t let your moment slip away 

You gotta want it enough 
Cause if you don’t the party’s over, 
But if you got what it takes 
We’re gonna make you into superstars 

Don’t let go, it’s like a rollercoaster ride 
Take a chance, we got it going on inside 
No regrets
 This ain’t a dress rehearsal 
Welcome to, Welcome to Avalon Heights
 
 
I’ll take you to a place that’ll set you free 
Down in Avalon
I know it’ll blow your mind away 
You gotta believe in yourself now 
Down at Avalon 
So don’t let your moment slip away 

So if you want it, we got it, show us what to do 
Cause we can do it, we'll prove it, demonstrate to you 
That we're not playin', we're stayin' 
Cause nothing’s gonna stop us till we’re through 
Nothing’s gonna stop us 

Don’t let go, it’s like a rollercoaster ride 
Take a chance, we got it going on inside 
so regret this ain’t a dress rehearsal 
Welcome to, Welcome to Avalon Heights 

 
I’ll take you to a place that’ll set you free 
Down in Avalon 
I know it’ll blow your mind away 
You gotta believe in yourself now 
Down at Avalon 
So don’t let your moment slip away
