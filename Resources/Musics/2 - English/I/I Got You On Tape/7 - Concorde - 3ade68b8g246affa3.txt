CONCORDE

People and payment
Echoes of cool in the air
Loveless dragons in everholy matrimony
Birds and bees banging quietly out in the night on sad memories
To form a dark love movement
To make a dead song disappear
To have cherry red evening babies screaming loud for more

Stop motion reality
Dead ends for me
I am forever tied to the floor
Bring all of your troops in for war
Think it's about that time now
Sitting right here waiting for you to

Call me kamikaze
Call me commodore
Call me anything you want
Call me never ender
Call me never more concorde

I sing but I cannot see
Never asleep
Endlessly waking up on the floor
Come mother down do the door
Sit and cause the tension
I am wound down pushing the envelope for

Kawasaki
Closer to the core
Reason when and if I want  concorde
Certain never ender
Falling never more
Concorde
