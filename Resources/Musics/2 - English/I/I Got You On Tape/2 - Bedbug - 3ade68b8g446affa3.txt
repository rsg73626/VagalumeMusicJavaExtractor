BEDBUG

So I tell you what to think and say and do
While my words keep growing stronger
Just a simple song to say that I love you
That I can't hold back much longer

Little finger come across a bedbug
Chances are I've got it on my hand
What I meant to say was not enough
Not a part of my plan

So I tell you what to think and say and do
While my words keep growing stronger
Just a simple song to say that I love you
That I can't hold back much longer
