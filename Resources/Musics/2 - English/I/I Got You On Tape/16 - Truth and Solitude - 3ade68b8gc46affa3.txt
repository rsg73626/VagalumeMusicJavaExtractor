TRUTH AND SOLITUDE

Standing in a ray of light
I am on the dark side of the moon
As if in a pantomime
I have come by the use of balloons

To portray the mess I'm in
I get physical and start to shout
Where the sky is black and the air is thin
And my voice is mainly heard within the clouds

Where the sound of me against you ring the bells forever more
Will my soul survive or will it crash and burn
When we're done will I be standing with my back against the wall
Will the times of truth and solitude return

There's a room where we can go
There's a place that I can take you to
Where the things you think you know
Do not always turn out to be true

Where a holy man will suddenly appear before your eyes
Just to seperate the wicked from the sad
To uncover who is hiding and who is in a disguise
And in the end congregate the good and bad

Where the sound of me against you ring the bells forever more
Will my soul survive or will it crash and burn
When we're done will I be standing with my back against the wall
Will the times of truth and solitude return
