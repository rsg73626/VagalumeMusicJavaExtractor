HAMMERTIME

Heavy rain coming down on my shoulder
We've been waiting for too long
Where the sun and the moon collides
Coming close together
You're holding my heart for a while
You're doing the best that you can
We're trying to lose ourselves, trying to manage on our own

Hoping everything will change to last
And none of us will stay the way we were
I can see them coming round the corner in a red limousine
Making the boys cry for mercy and the girls scream
They're talking changes

There's a million different reasons why I shouldn't be here
Holding this key in my hand with you shouting in my ear
We're going nowhere
A million reasons why I shouldn't bang my head to the wall
Hammertime on the curve of a phonecall
So very outthere
So very close to home

Growing big and better there it comes
The definition of what hits your eye
There is noone nearly good as me at leaving things to chance
Another night at a club rubadub dance
In need of changes
