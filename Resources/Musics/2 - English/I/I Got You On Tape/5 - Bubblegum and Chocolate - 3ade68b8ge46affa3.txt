BUBBLEGUM AND CHOCOLATE

Time to learn the alphabet, beginning all over again
From top to bottom all memorized
Point your fingers in the air and tell me only if you dare
The words I want hear come alive

Stand upon my shoulders
Repeat after me
One year form now it's my birthday
The moon is a wooden ball
I don't believe mathematics at all

Bend and twist the facts around, your wristwatch counterclockwise
Sitting down for supper feeling good about the meal
This is what it's like to feel confused and bending backwards
While running from the police

Like bubblegum and chocolate
The need after more
We've got the drug that you're after
The book of your favorite school
Struck by the sound of your laughter
And the things that you do
