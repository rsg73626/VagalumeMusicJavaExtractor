BUZZ ON MY BLOCK

Favorite drug of the year 2005
On the tip of my tongue more dead than alive
Shot my blood cocaine
Felt it wash my brain like I was guacamole
I could do it with you, push go to give in
No matter what I'd choose I'd be singing to win
I have no control but I shine like gold whenever on the dancefloor

Rabbits, high heels and horses, leatherstockings, 
I surrender completely
On the tube 
I see them screaming television made me kind of crazy
And all I want to know is
What does it mean to you that we're building the bomb
Where does it come from
What is the outcome
Maybe we should be dancing

When I do it somehow you seem to give up
Borderline when I bow and go turn it up
Brought the wheels of steel
With a tender feel to the reason I deliver
There is nothing besides everything that I've got
Running time after time, the buzz on my block
I don't want it there when 
I breathe the air while crying like a breastfed

Little did 
I know you went and blew it all on house and wife and babies
Whatever you choose to do you 
never fail to constantly amaze me
And all I want to know is
Ahat does it mean to you that we're building the bomb
Ahere does it come from
Ahat is the outcome
Maybe we should be dancing
