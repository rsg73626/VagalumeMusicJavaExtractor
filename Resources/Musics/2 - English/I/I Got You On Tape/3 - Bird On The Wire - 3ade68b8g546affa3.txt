BIRD ON THE WIRE

I can't really tell what's up or down
I can't tell where this is coming from
This beat has got me running round in circles
Someone dropped a bomb on me
I am found dead or alive

On a dancefloor filled with flashing lights
With a devils haircut on my mind
And I don't know if it's yours or mine
My feet are falling out of time I see
A rocket shooting to the sky

Higher and higher
No one knows excactly what the time is
But the stars are out tonight
Bird on the wire
Lift me up and I'll prepare to take off
I will go without a fight

If the music stops will I explode
From my head and spine down to my toes
While the blood is running through my nose
I ask you if knowing what you know is real
Will I need you to get by

In this galaxy I'm not alone
I don't think I'd make it on my own
So I wave my hands up high to show
I am grateful for the lack of boundaries
Where the air is very light

I go higher and higher
No one knows excactly what the time is
But the stars are out tonight
Bird on the wire
Lift me up and I'll prepare to take off
I will go without a fight
