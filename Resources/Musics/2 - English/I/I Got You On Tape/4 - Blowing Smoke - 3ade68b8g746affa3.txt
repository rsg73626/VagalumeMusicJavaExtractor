BLOWING SMOKE

And I sat at the watch tower
And I didn't do a thing
Blowing smoke to the air with a window open for you
And I saw it was late
And I dreamt to be alone
I was talking on the phone and it felt like something you'd do

Nothing comes from my calling
No one came to the cafeteria
Duck down as we bite another one

Safe and sound from what is outthere
Louder now your favorite nightmare

Nevermind when I'm on top
Looking up from a low
There is always something there to keep me busy
In between now and then
No one knows where I've been
Counting sheep at the drugstore, waiting at the drive in

And the music is changing
Coming to a dead stop
Your president won't catch me or my band

Running cold, the winter water
Icy blue like frozen flowers
Safe and sound from what is outthere
Louder now your favorite nightmare
