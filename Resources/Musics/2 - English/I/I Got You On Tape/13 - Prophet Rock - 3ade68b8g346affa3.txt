PROPHET ROCK

I've been wanting to say the word but it don't seem right yet
Like a warm locomotive going cold 
I've been sleeping odd for a while
Where the bushes come in all kind of colors
Where I learn to stay awake

I am buzzing like a chainsaw
So I turn to you, we talk about the weather
And I guess you feel the same
Guess you think you want what I've got

Million after million through my head and pocket
Thousands and thousands it never ends
Here is what I do and here is when I profit
Buildings collapse and I build them back up again

Like a doctor and an astronaut would agree with eachother
I can tell by your smile that you're ready to take a chance on me
Where I sing a song to say there's nothing wrong with me now
I am steady like a trackdog
And the women and the children have their heads on backwards
Now I think you've caught what I've got

Million after million through my head and pocket
Thousands and thousands it never ends
Here is what I do and here is when I profit
Buildings collapse and I build them back up again
