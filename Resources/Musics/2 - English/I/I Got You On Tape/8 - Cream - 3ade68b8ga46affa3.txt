CREAM

Left you bleeding when I did my taekwondo
And drove my motorbike to heaven
Clairvoyant for a minutes time or two
I had you breathles for a second

Caught you hanging in my club around midnight
Took you out in a shaolin swordfight
Give me your heart then I might leave you be
The killer that you once were

I can feel it coming through my microphone
My favorite moonlit beach recordings
I see it better now the rain has gone
Sometimes those wu tang kids are boring

Caught you hanging in my club around midnight
Took you out in a shaolin swordfight
Through war and peace sometimes I leave you be
The killer that you once were
