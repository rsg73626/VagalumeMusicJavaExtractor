LE COMPLICATION

Without speaking my name you said it loud and clear
Voices in a tight spot come on over here
Every single day of the week will have to do by now
Anywhere you want to go is all fine by me

The legend of a pink ferrari, the loss of something dear to you
Your reason to be cheerful, your very first day in school
The voices in the back of your head sailing a diamond sea
Grafitti on your bedroom walls and loose cannons going crazy

Is it warm where going
Is there fun to be
Can I come along or do I have to stay at home?
Is it cold
Is it snowing
Is there room for me to nevermind 
what's up and down and right or wrong

I heard you weren't afraid of the dark no more like you used to be
That the monsters hiding our underneath 
your bed had gone away for good
That when summer comes around 
you have a plan to go out camping
By yourself in the woods
Light up a heavy bonfire and wish it all away

Dream you've been sleeping
For a thousand years
Waking up while breaking down these bits and pieces
Man what a morning
I'm up and wide awake
Ready to begin all over again
