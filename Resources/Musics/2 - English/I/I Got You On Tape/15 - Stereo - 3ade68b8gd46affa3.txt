STEREO

You're saying war is not enough
Very greedy to think that you can buy my love
And you talk of religion and of the good things that you found
But it shows all to well that the same things are bringing you down

I think you worry all too much
Love is easy I guess for those who dare to touch
A flower from the city on a midnight run
Growing roots in the shade in the middle of a marathon

It's very easy to believe
With the patience you have it was easy to get over me
I've been around enough to see
What the difference is between fiction and reality

You're disappearing in a dream
It's a thin line before you hit insanity
Now the only girl you really want is close but far away
I'm afraid it's too late anyhow no matter what you say

It's very easy to believe
With the patience you have it was easy to get over me
I've been around enough to see
What the difference is between fiction and reality
