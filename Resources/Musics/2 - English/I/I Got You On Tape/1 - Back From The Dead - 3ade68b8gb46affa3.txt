BACK FROM THE DEAD

Sometime near in the future shortly after the storm
I'll be crossing the border if you want to come along
Birds will flock in the valley to see where the horses have gone
You and I will be married and the choir will sing a song

And I will be safely on my way
To keep you company
To bring you home to where you belong
And walk straight into the heavens
In spite of what has been said
And bring the melody makers back from the dead

In a field somewhere in the country we'll sit and stare at the sun
And pray for everybody who wants someone to love
The flowers growing beside us will reach up into the sky
And we will with all of our powers for rest of both our lives

Be well aware we all have got our time
A heart will beat untill
The day is done with no exception
The gods will sit in a temple
And watch us over our heads
Ghost like, willing and able as you go to bed

And I will be safely on my way
To keep you company
To bring you home to where you belong
And walk straight into the heavens
In spite of what has been said
And bring the melody makers back from the dead
