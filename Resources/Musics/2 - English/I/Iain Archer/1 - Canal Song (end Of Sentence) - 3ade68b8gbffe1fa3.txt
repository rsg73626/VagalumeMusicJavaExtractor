CANAL SONG (END OF SENTENCE)

I saw it leave your face
Its the only thing that I need
Its the only thing that I need so take it

I caught you and your canvas eyes
With the only thing that I need
With the only thing that I need but take it

Something you put in the waste Im craving
Its the only thing that I need
Its the only thing that I need but take it

If youd prefer it erased then bleach the place
Its the only thing that I need
Its the only thing that I need

But my heart it never breaks
It just beats on despite the ache
And the day I touch you and make you see
Broken well be
You and me

The birds fly south tonight
Theyve given up
Its the only thing that I need
Its the only thing that I need but take it

The skies grow dark beneath their wings
What does it mean?
Its the only thing that I need
Its the only thing that I need

But my heart it never breaks
It just beats on despite the ache
And the day I touch you and make you see
Broken well be
You and me
