OXYGEN

She's as thin as oxygen, floating in my head again
I wish that I could breathe her in like smoke
Falling off the tracks again, crawling up your back, before you know it
She's beneath your skin like dope

She said "You don't know how I feel, you don't know what is real"
I lost myself to find you there
But you weren't there at all

Got a heart like glass but she don't care
Alone in her electric chair burning up the atmosphere again
She's loaded up on plastic dreams, coming undone at the seams
Wrap those wings around you 'till you don't see straight
You don't see straight

I lost myself, myself
