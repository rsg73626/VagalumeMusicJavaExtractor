WATERFALL

If i walk away
would it be the same
if i was afraid
could i find a way
if you fall through my hands like a beachful of sand would you still understand what i say

you showered me with love
and i wonder why
storms are up above
swimming in my mind
i feel like im choking
diamods are broken
and falling around me like rain

oh waterfall, oh waterfall
oh waterfall just take it all away

blowing with the wind
driven 'round the bend
closer to the edge
time to breathe again
but there's no explanation
no real invitation
i feel my creations again

so get out while you can
leave behind the senses
get out while you can
while youve got the stregnth
im losing direction with so many questions
they leave me no answers again

oh waterfall, oh waterfall
oh waterfall just take it all away

take me out and wash me down
hold me under watch me drown
hold me tight, the waterfall

Oh waterfall, oh waterfall
oh waterfall just take it all away

time to breathe again (x5)
breathe again...
