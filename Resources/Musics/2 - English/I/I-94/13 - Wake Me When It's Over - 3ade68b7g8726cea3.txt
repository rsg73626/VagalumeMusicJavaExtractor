WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER

I breathe in the air to the rhythm as I watch you sleep 
I wait for the chemicals pull me underneath 
You sold me your wings but I still can’t fall away 
Cuz its warm in my head and I’m crashing against the waves 
When you find me, find me there 
Wake me when it’s over  
Cuz I don’t want to feel a thing at all 
Wake me when it’s over 
Keep me tranquilized and break my fall 
Yeah break my fall 

It’s been along time since you’ve laughed while you watch me bleeding 
It’s been along time since you called me through the cream 
You never made a sound but inside I heard you screaming 
You never come around but I don’t miss your parade 

When you find me, find me there 
Wake me when it’s over  
Cuz I don’t want to feel a thing at all 
Wake me when I’ts over 
Keep me tranquilized and break my fall 
Yeah break my fall 

Yeah when I close my eyes and crawl inside myself 
Does it show there’s no surprise there’s nothing else 
Let me hide in isolation I don’t need this hesitation 
You can keep this sad relation on the shelf 

Wake me when it’s over 
Cuz I don’t want to feel a thing at all 
Wake me when it’s over 
Keep me tranquilized and break my fall 
Yeah I never thought that it could be 
I never thought that it could be this way 
Don’t be so surprised 
Don’t be so alarmed don’t wake me 
Don’t be so alarmed don’t wake me 
Don’t wake me
