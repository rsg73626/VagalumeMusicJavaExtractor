FEELIN' ALRIGHT

Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause ev'ry night I have the stangest dreams;
Imprisoned by the way it could have been,
Left here on my own or so it seems.
I've got to leave before I start to scream,
But someone locked the door and took the key.
You feelin' alright
I'm not feelin' too good myself,
Well, you feelin' alright, ...
