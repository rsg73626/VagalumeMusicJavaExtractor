AIR

I wouldn't be laughing in your shoes
I wouldn't do that if I was you
I wouldn't be laughin' in your shoes, no way

Better watch out what you wish for
Think long and hard what you live for
Better watch out what you wish for today

I bring you air, start breathing, start breathing
Don't stop and stare, I'm leaving, I'm leaving

Be choosey about who you sleep with
Be friends to the secrets you keep with
Be choosey about who you sleep with, they say

I bring you air...

Sometimes you hope so hard that it drives you insane
All your dreams are in a bag that gets dumped in the rain
I can see it in your eyes, no surprise
Your disguise tells me lies along the way
