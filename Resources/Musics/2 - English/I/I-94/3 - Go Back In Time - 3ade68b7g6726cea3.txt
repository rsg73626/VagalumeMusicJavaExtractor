GO BACK IN TIME

If you take off your shoes, then you can walk all over me
But I've been abused, caught up in the crush of the cavalry
I took for granted all of those yesterdays
I'm still enchanted, by you so I gotta say

If I could go back in time,
I would give the wide world just to change your mind
To open up your eyes
If I could go back in time

There's no music, there ain't no sunshine to play
There's no blue sky, just red sky that'll fade
Walking through this street parade
And the wind cuts through me with you raining down all around me

If I could go back in time
I would give the wide world just to change your mind
To open up your eyes
If I could go back in time
To find some reminder what you left behind
To open up your eyes
If I could go back in time, in time

If you take off your shoes, then you can walk all over me
But I've been abused, I've been abused
