NOT ALONE

If I could turn, run with a kiss
Would you surrender, maybe resist
Letting it go, all that there is
Make an escape and walk out on this
Swimming in wine, you'll be the first in line to fall
So far behind, closing your eyes

But I'm not alone, I see for myself
I carry my fate in somebody else
I wanted to fly high in my mind
I am not alone

Nothing to lose, turning the tide
Feeling the sunrise sing in the night
Everyday, starting to bloom
Watching the way light shines in the room
Finding a way
Taking the weightless words from you
Taking my time, drawing a line

You were never grateful, I was never faithful
You were never something I could relate to
Paying no attention, nothing conversation,
Broken all relations, live in isolation
