ONE THING

Take the wheel, 'cuz I can't drive this car
I've taken it all so far
To find out what you are
To light your shinning star
It's tearing me all apart, yeah

Shot away, a night out on the town
A queen without a crown
Make-up sliding down
Your lookin' to be found
Shakin' it all around, yeah

There's only one thing, one thing baby
Bet your mama's gonna make it right
You know baby, I'm the one that keeps you warm at night

Close your eyes and shuffle for this deal
You know your looks can kill
Just show me something real
And tell me how it feels
Trippin' out in your heels, yeah

There's only one thing, one thing baby
Bet your mamma's gonna make it right
And you know baby, I,m the one that keeps you warm at night
'Cuz I know baby, I'm the one that's keeps you satisfied
But you know baby, your mamma's gonna make it right
Alright

The warning of your tease, brings you to my knees
Comin' over me

Come on, come on, come on baby
