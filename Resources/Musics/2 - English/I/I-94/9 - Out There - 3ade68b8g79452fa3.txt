OUT THERE

If you could only see yourself, the way I see you
Would your world remain a stage, or would it break you
Is it you or someone else, who chose to stay inside your universe
And hid behind the mask you wear again

I hope you find yourself, out there
I hope you see yourself somewhere

And when the conversation's thin and growing shallow
You put on your plastic grin, and they will swallow
Well is it you or someone else, without a friend
No one gets to know you while you hide behind the mask you wear again

Just how many lessons can you learn, until the show down
Just how many bridges can you burn? Burn them all
Don't count on me to be there when you fall, out there

If you could see yourself out there

Just how many bridges burned, just how many lessons learned
Just how many bridges burned out there, out there

If you could only see yourself the way I see you
There'll be nothing left to say
