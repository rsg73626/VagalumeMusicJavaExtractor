THIS TIME AROUND

Tell me I'm wrong,
Tell me that you're strong,
Tell me it's all over,
Kick me into overdrive,
Throw me a lifeline,
Get me on my feet,
Take me to the other side,
Get me off the street,
Beggin you please now.

I need something in my life,
That fill my eyes with light; my ears with sound
I need something that feels right,
Gonna hold on to my life this time around.

Tell me a way,
Tell me I should stay,
Tell me is not over,
-don't know what it says-
Tell me it's OK now,
Something that I need
Take it off my shoulders,
Get me off my knees,
Beggin you please now.

I need something in my life,
That fill my eyes with light; my ears with sound
I need something that feels right,
Gonna hold on to my life this time around.

I need something in my life,
That fill my eyes with light; my ears with sound
I need something that feels right,
Gonna hold on to my life this time around.

Gonna hold on to my life this time around.
