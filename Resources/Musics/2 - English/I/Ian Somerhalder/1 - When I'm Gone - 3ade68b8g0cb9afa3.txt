WHEN I'M GONE

Its always been a forever and ever dream of what you
and I would be.
It's always been mistakes forgiven and what matter is
you and me
i wish i could trust you for each and everything
i wish you wouldn't have left nada only left me with a reason to sing

come back and be mine, sweet mine, sweet whine
came back and be mine, sweet whine, be mine
I wish i could trust you again, 
but you seem not to be trustworthy 
after breaking my heart behind my back.

I did notice it, but i didn't want to beleive 
Love me sweet whine
be mine
