CLEAR HEAD

Your face says you’re doing well,
You’re eyes scream misery.
Words fall out of your mouth ‘cause they have to.
On again with this mindless fucking routine.
Go home, drink, and cry yourself to sleep.
Mental pain turns into pure hatred.

Blank faced with bags under your eyes.
They take comfort in your misery.
They see it and they feel it.
You bring joy to lives knowing it’s not them.

I am disgusting human waste.
I am disgusting.
Blank faced with bags under your eyes.
They take comfort in your misery.
Go home and cry yourself to sleep,
Sleep on.
Cry yourself to sleep.
Nothing is going to change.
I am disgusting human waste.

We all know we are going to die,
Now seems like it might be the right time.
