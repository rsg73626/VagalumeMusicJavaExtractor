MISERY CLOUD

They came, they fucking conquered!
The swarm moves in quickly, they move through the night.
Whipping out everything that stands in their way.
It's a violent sweep, it takes no mercy.
Skies run black, the buzz turns loud.
Taking no prisoners.
There is nothing that will save you now.
Black rain feed on all,

Destroy them all.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Black rain feed on all, destroy them all.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!

No mercy, against the black rain.
Strong and the weak weep all the same.
No mercy, against the black rain.
Strong and the weak weep the fucking same!
Ripping, tearing, devouring all.
The stench is unbearable!
The scene indescribable, black rain feed on all.
Ripping, tearing, devouring all.
The stench is unbearable!
The scene indescribable, black rain feed on all.
Full blown all out war, we have nowhere to run.

Destroy them all.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Is this worth fighting for?
This scene indescribable.
Black rain feed on all,
Destroy them all!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
