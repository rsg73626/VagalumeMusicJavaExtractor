FINAL HOUR

In the blackness my body resides.
I feel the grasp of our dark lord.
Father, I have betrayed you.
Father, I have betrayed you.

On a full moon blood painted the plains.
We are shackled by the power of his reign.
My own blood is just the start.
The start of our massive destruction.
Destruction.

Come and see what’s left.
Not a fucking thing.
The hour of apocalypse has struck.
The damage has been done.
I couldn’t give a fuck.

Destruction.

Coe and see what’s left.
Not a fucking thing.

We are scum of the earth.
Underneath our boiling skin are just empty souls sucking the life out of one another,
Trying to fill the hole.
We are scum of the earth.
My craving for flesh is getting worse.
How much longer must I wait?
This appetite for violence is unmatched.
Psychosis overtaking my brain.
