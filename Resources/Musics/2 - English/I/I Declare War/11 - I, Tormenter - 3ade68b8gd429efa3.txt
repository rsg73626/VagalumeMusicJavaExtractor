I, TORMENTER

I laugh at your fear,
Tied up, bound down.
Bringing in tools of hell bent destruction.

Digging into your upper chest,
I let the razor edge slide down to your cock.
While I’m down there,
I hatchet everything off.
Screams are like an orchestra,
Symphony of sorts.
You must see this.
You must see my masterpiece at work.

Break your knees and then your arms.
The screams are getting worse.
My bloodlust’s fueled with no remorse.

Scream for your God, scream.
No one will save you.
Scream on, scream.
Slicing your face,
I take a taste of your cooling blood.

I am God.
I am master.
I, the bringer of pain and pure torment.

Try to pass out to relieve yourself;
I will not let you sleep.
You must see this.
You must see my true masterpiece.

I am God,
I am master.
I, the bringer of pain and pure torment.

Haunt you in your dreams.
I am the king.
I am master.
Bow down before thee.
It’s good to be me.
Haunt you in your dreams.
I am the king.
Bow down before me.
