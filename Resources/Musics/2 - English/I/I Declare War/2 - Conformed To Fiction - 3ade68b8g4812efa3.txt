CONFORMED TO FICTION

All praise the false superstition as all hope and faith crumbles before your eyes.
We are all damned from birth as we begin to slowly decay.

In the grand scheme of it all you are worth nothing.
I am nothing.
We are nothing.

Trying to work a way into the promised land as this way of life comes crashing down.

Hold tight to a faith in this dead prophet.
I hate everything you stand for,
Live for,
And die for.

I am nothing,
We are nothing.

Conformity is wiping us all away.
Losing your identity in the pursuit of happiness.

A book filled with the greatest source of fiction known to man,
As judgment day comes to us all.

I will not bow my head.
My knees will not be bent.
I will not be a sheep in a mindless flock.

A poisoned idea of false thinking.
I will be my own fucking savior.
