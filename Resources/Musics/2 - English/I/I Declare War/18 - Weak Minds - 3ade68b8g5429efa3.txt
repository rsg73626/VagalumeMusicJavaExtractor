WEAK MINDS

Dear powerless god,
False martyr,
Fool.
True bringer of violence, pain, and sadness:
I know I will always be pure.
I have yet to lose the battle.
I refuse to lose to a myth, creature, or a fucking book.
I gather my fellow man here to day to call out this fucking fake.
I do not speak of abomination for there is nothing to abominate.

Stand before me.
Flames burn in all manâ€™s eyes.
Obliterate a system of believers.
Weak minds weep and they die.
Stand tall against all myth bringers.
Your faith breeds death; you are alone in this.

Fear no god,
Weep no longer.
I do not speak of abomination for there is nothing to abominate.

Stand before me.
I, a man of flesh and blood,
Air in my lungs.
I challenge you jesu.
Stand before me.
