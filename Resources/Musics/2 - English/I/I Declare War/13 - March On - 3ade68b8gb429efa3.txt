MARCH ON

Hail.
March on.
Wipe away the cross at all cost.
March on.
False prophet be gone.
Feed Christians to the lions; burn them on the cross.
Don’t bother putting out the fire; we are due to restart.

Men and women fighting, dying;
But for what?
Don’t bother putting out the fire; we are due to restart.

March on.
Conquer.
Destroy.
Spit on the cross.
Feed Christians to the lions; burn them on the cross.
Don’t bother putting out the fire; we are due to restart.

Redeem ourselves,
Burn it to the ground.
Don’t wipe them from the books.
Let people read we rid the world of Christ.
A fool if he existed,
A martyr absolutely not.
He was a fool.
His book will never be read again.

Alone we conquered a man,
Not a fucking God.
Burn their kingdom,
Piss on the cross.
