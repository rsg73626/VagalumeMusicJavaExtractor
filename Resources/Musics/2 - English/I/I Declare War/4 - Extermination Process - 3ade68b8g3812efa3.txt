EXTERMINATION PROCESS

Reaching out to help foreign countries,
Yet we cannot even fix our own problems.
The United States steps in when we see it to benefit our image.

What about the high rate of homeless on the streets?
Or the people still living in their cars in New Orleans?
These are the problems at hand.

Our country’s motto should be,
“Rob from the poor to feed the rich.”

Soldiers sent over sea’s never getting to see their families.
Losing their lives for higher political gains;
These are your sons and daughters.
Losing their lives for higher political gains;
Like lambs brought to the slaughter.
Giving their lives for a country founded on lies and deceit.
All in the general idea of God and government.
