HUMAN WASTE

I live my life in fear
I am human waste
Serving a purpose is far-fetched
We have taken advantage of it

We deserve what we get

Torch the skies black
Iced fucking earth
Torch the skies black
Iced fucking earth

Death is here to meet you at your gates
I welcome you, Tear me to shreds if you will
Indulge in my body

I give myself to you for what we've done

I am human waste
Weep for planet earth
Rain down your acid tears and burn it all away

Weep!
Weep!
Weep!

I am human waste
Weep for planet earth
Rain down your acid tears and burn it all away

Start over at square one (square one)

I live my life in fear
I am human waste
Serving A purpose is far-fetched
We have taken advantage of it

Torch the skies black
Iced fucking earth
Iced fucking earth
Iced fucking earth
