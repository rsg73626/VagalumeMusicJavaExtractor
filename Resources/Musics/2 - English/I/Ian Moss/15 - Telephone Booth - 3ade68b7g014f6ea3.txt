TELEPHONE BOOTH

I can't hide it, 
so good to be here. 
Lost in transit, 
out on a free year. 
There's no truth, 
eyeing me sideways. 

Just a telephone booth, 
on a highway. 

I ain't hiding, 
there's been no breakdown. 
Where I'm aiming, 
I see the sundown. 
One horizon, 
eyeing me sideways. 

Just a telephone booth, 
on a highway. 

Everything for miles, 
is high on the silence. 
Everything's my way. 

Where I'm calling, 
there's no religion. 
No-one falling, 
my absolution. 
Is all truth, 
eyeing me sideways. 

In a telephone booth, 
On a highway. 

I stand ready, 
for any new direction. 
That the sun may lead me down. 
Everything for miles, 
is high on the silence. 
Everything's my way. 

In a telephone booth, 
On a highway.
