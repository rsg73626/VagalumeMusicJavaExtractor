80 MPH BLUES

Woke up this morning 
Looked across the lawn 
Oh my God 
Both the cars were gone 

I got the blues now baby 
Since you been gone 
I've had nothing 
But bad news 

I had a car 
Loaned it to a friend 
He went eighty miles per hour 
Round a forty mile bend 

I built a mansion 
I painted it black 
Along came an earthquake 
And it fell down the crack
