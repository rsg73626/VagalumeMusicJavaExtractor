SOMETHING INCOMPREHENSIBLE

She cries for something incomprehensible
Her words tumble down her hair like rain
She screams for something that I don't own
She babbles gibberish insane

And all she wants is to be held 
All she needs is for someone to swear they'll never let her go
She cries for something incomprehensible
She asks for ansewer she'll never know

She listens to music with no words
She says she hears just what they say
Even though it's just music
She agrees with the incomprehensible words they play

And all she wants is to be held all she needs is for someone to swear
She cries for somthing incomprehensible
She asks for answers she'll never know

All she wants is just to hold me 
And tell me everything's okay
But she just criessomething incomprehensible
And I like it better that way.
