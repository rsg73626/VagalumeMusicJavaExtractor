SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING

Verse 1 
I went out walking through the city centre 
It happened just the other day 
Sometimes the harbour in the winter 
Blows a little luck my way 
I stood around like John Lee Hooker 
Waiting for my ship to come in 
But when you're down on your last twenty dollar 
The view is such a beautiful thing 

Verse 2 
I've seen a girl of twelve sit and shoot herself 
Higher than a national dream 
And sleep it off just a spit away 
From the tires of a limousine 
I may recall another world 
Where money never had no sting 
But right here she's a big girl now 
The city's such a beautiful thing 

Her eyes are as cold as a centrefold 
And her mouth has come undone 
And like a child conceived on new years eve 
She don't belong to anyone 

Verse 3 
You don't need to hold a lot of money 
To figure how the world goes round 
You don't need to climb on anybody 
To get a feel for what goes down 
She could be on the colour TV 
Teachin' all the world to sing 
But out here on a black and white pier 
It ain't such a beautiful thing 

Verse 4 
Now I'm a Northern Territory man 
The territory lives in me 
And I fail to understand 
The silly bloody things I see 
I went out walking through the city centre 
Thinking back to Alice Springs 
This place is harder every winter 
And home is such a beautiful thing 

Verse 5 
I went out walking through the city centre 
It happened just the other day 
Sometimes the harbour in the winter 
Blows a little luck my way 
I went out walking through the city centre 
Thinking back to Alice Springs 
This place is harder every winter 
And home is such a beautiful thing 
This place is harder every winter 
And home is such a beautiful thing
