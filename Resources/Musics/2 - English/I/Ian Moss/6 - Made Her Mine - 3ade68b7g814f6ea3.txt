MADE HER MINE

Rode into town on a broken line 
Found my girl and I found some wine 
Spent my money makin' her feel good 
Found us a room and I made her mine 
Made her mine yeah I made her mine 
Found us a room and I made her mine 
Rode into town on a broken line 
Found my girl and I made her mine 

Yeah, it aint easy 
To get it ..... 
How it has to be 

I'm just a man 
with all to do 
She's just the one 
to get me through 

Yeah, it aint easy
