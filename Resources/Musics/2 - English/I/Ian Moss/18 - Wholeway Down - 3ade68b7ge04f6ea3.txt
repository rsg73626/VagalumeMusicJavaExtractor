WHOLEWAY DOWN

It don' matter what I do today 
It don' matter anyway 
It don' matter where I go today 
Cos I've been missin' 
Missin' all your kissing 

I've was missing you 
The whole way down 
I've was kissing you 
The whole way down 

It don' matter where I'll be today 
It don' matter anyway 
It don' matter who I see today 
Cos I've been missin' 
Missin' all your kissing
