TWO SECONDS TOO LONG

Two seconds too long 
Two seconds too long 
An innocent kiss, went on 
Two seconds too long 

Just an innocent kiss 
And I could do no wrong 
I could do no right 
Two seconds too long 

Everybody knows 
When you hit the big one 
It's a mother 
Later she and I 
We got to slip away 
And get together 

Now she calls me baby 
Sugar pie del-tong 
We do everything we do 
Two seconds too long 

Everybody knows 
When you hit the real thing 
It's a crime 
Anytime of day 
Baby gets to play 
With my time 

Two seconds too long 
Two seconds too long 
An innocent kiss, went on 
Two seconds too long 

Just an innocent kiss 
And all my troubles are gone 
It's alright 
Two seconds too long
