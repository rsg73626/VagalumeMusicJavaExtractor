TUCKER'S DAUGHTER

Hang me for a sucker On the plains out of Narrabri Swingin' a hoe in a CAL-cotton row Sweatin' on the dangers to me Bossman's Mr. Tucker He's a man I don't care to defy And his only child wicked and wild is seeking my company She wanna build me up tear me down Slap my knee bones to the ground Me and mine are gonna be around
When Tuckers' daughter's a memory Hot sun is a killer She'll be waitin' at the end of my line Taking the shade with a cool lemonade sayin' Boy I wanna talka to you Bossmans' only daughter She ain't his and she'll never be mine
Never be down on a dollar or two Or told what she's gonna do She wanna build me up tear me down Slap my knee bones to the ground Me and mine are gonna be around When Tuckers' daughters a memory Build me up tear me down I won't kneel 'til the trumpet sounds And Tuckers' daughter's a memory People born with all they need They don't understand Everything you want don't come from holding out your hand Tuckers' daughter thinks she sees A slave at her command I know you need some time yet baby But when the time is right Babe I just ain't your man
