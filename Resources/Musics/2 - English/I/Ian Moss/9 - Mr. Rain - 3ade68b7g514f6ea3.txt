MR. RAIN

Falling down, cold upon my window. 
Lonely sound, tell me where did you go? 
You think you'll find me crying, 
But I'll be ready this time, 
Mr. Rain. 

All day long, I search the sky for change. 
Now I need you touch, what can you arrange? 
You think you'll find me crying, 
But I'll be ready soon. 
Here it comes again, 
Dropping in just like an old friend. 
(rain) Just when you crave the sun, (Mr. Rain) 
You'll wet your tongue on Mr. Rain. 

Lonh ago we spent our magic hour. 
Now I pray for rain, 
I need it's healing power. 
You think you'll find me crying, 
But I'll be ready this time Mr. Rain.
