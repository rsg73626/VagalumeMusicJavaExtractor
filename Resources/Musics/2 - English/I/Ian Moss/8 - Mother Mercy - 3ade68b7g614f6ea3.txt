MOTHER MERCY

Tell me baby what's on your mind 
If you don't no peace I'll find 
Only time, time can tell 
Baby baby I thought I knew you well 

(Mother Mercy) 
Baby wont you please 
Share some charity 
Lord it's only time 
Say what's on your mind 

Drink this water drink this wine 
With this boy no secrets find 
Toss and turn all night long 
With this love find nothing wrong
