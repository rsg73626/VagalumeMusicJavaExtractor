IF I EVER GET TO HEAVEN

If I ever get to heaven 
I think I know now 
What I'll see 
I'm gonna find a certain someone 
Who's been waiting there for me 

She's gonna be there in a mansion 
Made of corrugated iron 
If I ever get to heaven 
I think I know now 
What I'll find 

She will be there in that single room 
Across that lonely plain 
She will be there with her hair down 
She'll be combing out the rain 
And a candle wick of kerosene 
Will burn across her face 
And the wounds that she inflicted 
They'll be healed without a trace
