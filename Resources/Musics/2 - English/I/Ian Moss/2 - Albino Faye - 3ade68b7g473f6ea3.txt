ALBINO FAYE

She disappeared lonely 
Into a rainstorm 
Nobody loved her 
Nobody knew her 
Somebody claimed her 
Out on a highway 
She disappeared one day 
They say she met a stranger 

Albino Faye, 
Albino Faye 

Her skin was snow white 
Out on a highway 
Her pink eyes shone bright 
Under the moonlight 
Nobody loved her 
Nobody knew her 
Nobody missed her 
They say she met a stranger
