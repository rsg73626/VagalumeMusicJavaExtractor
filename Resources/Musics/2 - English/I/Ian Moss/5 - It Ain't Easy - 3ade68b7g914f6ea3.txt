IT AIN'T EASY

I couldn't believe it 
I dont understand 
Why I'm drivin' my baby 
Into the arms of another man 

It aint easy....It aint easy 

As I'm sleeping beside you 
Something deep inside 
Says that you and me babe 
Will be together 'til the end of time 

All our friends are breaking up 
Blaming it on the times 
Me I just keep ****ing up 
I keep ignoring all of the signs 

I've got this feelin' 
Gettin' stronger every day 
'Bout this love he's stealin' 
I think I'll blow the ever away
