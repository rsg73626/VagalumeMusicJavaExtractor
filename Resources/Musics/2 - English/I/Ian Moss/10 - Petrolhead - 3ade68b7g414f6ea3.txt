PETROLHEAD

Met a girl at a hill-climb 
Joined up for a good time 
Had a kid and a blue dog 
Most days we got on the grog 

I was born in a petrol head town 
Found Jesus a quarter mile down the road 
Lost my cherry in an old caravan 
I was raised a petrol head man 

Wazza Wazza was a mate o' mine 
We left the dogs and the kids behind 
We hit the highway following nothing more 
Than the roar of a 454
