POORBOY

Sun down Big City 
And all my money is gone 
Sun down and I'm thinkin' 
Back to where I used to call home 
Every blowhard barjockey 
In every town I ever knew 
Said if you play hard 
You get lucky 
It ain't necessarily true 

I'm a Poorboy, Big City 
Smalltown used to be home 
Poorboy, Big City 
I've never been so all alone 

One time I had all the good lovin' 
Of a young girl in my hand 
I left town and never stopped runnin' 
Never stopped to understand 
Seeking unknown sensations 
And every new sight to be seen 
Took a greyhound to Penn Station 
To follow some impossible dream 

Now for all you sum' bitches 
Dreamin' out the back o' some mall 
Thinking somewhere else it all happens 
Well it dont happen at all 
I get by the best that I'm able 
Long as I'm getting stoned 
Got the whole world coming at me on cable 
I've never been so all alone
