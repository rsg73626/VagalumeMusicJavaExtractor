HE JUDGE, THE LENDER

Is this what I heard about so many times before.
Under the eye, my fears becoming evidence
No way to stop the sweat, the trembling of my voice
This plaque lies here, your name stamped on it

Forgive my life lender

Is this what I heard about so many times before
All this pressure, all this deceit disguised
as a social based corp, people like you with the will to help.
Make your dreams come true, you projects...

Realize that I dont feel like i'm being helped
I dont really see the amability on your punishing questions
is all this humiliating interrogation justified?
This chair wont let me go 'till my pockets completely drained.
