THE CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR GREED

Your hand holds my hand and your look relieves my pain, oh brother
Where's the might?Our faith fades away as our lives
As our feet rooted to the ground chain our moves
We see from here that they come and leave and they come and leave....

I know you're strangled now cause of the blood from your lungs
But mother's no longer here to pay our medicine
Probably one day we'll be working for them,
Killing our brothers will just be a daily routine

Our fate is controlled by machines
Machines that create lab-made death
Deseases that allow them to reduce us to dust, erase the threat
Of a new world having its say...

WE ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR GREED
