MAGNIFICENCE OF PROSPERITY AND BLOODBATHS

Hipnotic waves massage my cortex unconciously enjoying the smell
of the Blood
A Reflex shining, blinding me, its all I once I refused to see
Land of the free is fed with blood. Pain is like porn, wealth to be god
Increasing the power through prostitution senseless taxes and clean corruption
Artificial seduction leveling in the air
Abandon your remaining ideals nothing is fair
Its all established further than horizon
Avoid risks of the unknown, never leave the expeted behaviour
All those gray buildings, mechanical submission you'll never dare...
The magnificence of prosperity and bloodbaths
