PENITENT

And now fight, fight, fight, fight our lies.
And now die, die, die, die, and smile
Penitent.
Excuse me madame could you please tell me if this road leads to hell
or is it just the heat of the sun wich makes my wheels melt
I dont know! Stupid naïve
Dont you know?Dont you remember?
You've rode this suicidal horse
a milion times before
But its not me who determines your fate
nor the distance, you're too late
Admit, my dear, you've gone too far
And stones you left have been removed...
Somehow, the seed has grown
and voices speak to you about submission, plebeyan!
And now, the pill on your tongue tastes sweet and sour
"At least it is worth it", you think.
Will yhey finally respect a man of courage who's left a life of disgrace
and proud of facing dangers,and common enemies risks his life to a nation safe
I dont know! Stupid naïve
Dont you know?Dont you remember?
You've ride this suicidal horse
a milion times before
But its not me who determine your fate
nor the distance, you're too late
Admit, my dear, you've gone too far
And stones you left have been removed...
