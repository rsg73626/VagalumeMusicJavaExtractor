ONLY ON TUESDAYS

Life poses so many damn questions
You can't answer half of them
It gets so irritating sometimes
Don't think I don't know
Your Peter Pan Complex really pisses me off
You try to hang your shit on me of all people
When you wear unmatching clothes
I honestly think you're an idiot
Theoretically speaking to all of you
I'm a horrible public speaker
Although those who know me well
Know I'm not afraid to voice my opinions
Organized religion isn't my style
I'm not an avid church goer
Does that mean I'll burn in hell
Some say I'm looking for a modern day miracle
