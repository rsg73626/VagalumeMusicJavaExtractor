VELVET GOLDMINE

She spent twenty years in the Dakota
Every single day it was black in the Dakota
Riot grrrls think you can stop me
And you're forever in her debt
Well I know you haven't sent me
And you haven't sent her yet
She spent twenty years like a virus
They want to burn the witch who's inside us
Well you, you don't fuck with the fabulous four
Or you spend the rest of your life
Picking things up off the floor
She's still alive but I am sure
That all the stars belong to her
On California king-sized beds
She's wrapped in rags inside my head
This is the story, this is the story of someone who's wild
Big black rules, pearl, life
(I don't remember, I forget)
Oh, baby dry your dirty eyes
My water breaks like turpentine
The pee girl burns to be a bride
Your ever lovely suicide
Are they coming for me
Are they coming soon
Hey Jude, hey Jude
Are they coming for me
Judy, Judy
Are they coming soon
(I don't remember, I forget)
The pee girl burns to be a bride
Your ever lovely suicide
I don't remember, I forget
