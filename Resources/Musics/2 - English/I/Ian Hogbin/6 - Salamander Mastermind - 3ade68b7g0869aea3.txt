SALAMANDER MASTERMIND

I'm alright
I'm not ill anymore
Take your time
As you walk through the door
Do your thing
Because you just do it so well
Better than me
We both know it's not the same
Chorus:
It's not the same
When you touch yourself
There's no pain
Just pleasure
There's no pain
Oh my God
Do you feel it inside
Can you feel it
I'm feeding off of your charge
Hurry up
And finish it off
Because I know you want it
The right way now
Chorus x2
What a feeling
What a feeling
What a feeling
Oh...
Chorus x2
You're trading the pain for pleasure
