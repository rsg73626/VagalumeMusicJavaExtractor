AIN'T NO BIG DEAL

Chorus:
It ain't no big deal
Just leave it alone
Ain't no big deal
It ain't no big deal
Just let it go
Ain't no big deal
Though you may think
That you know
Everything about me
You truly don't
You got the body
I got the hands
Now it's time
To break it down
Take the time
To fool around
Chorus x2
Well you know
It ain't no big deal
It ain't no big deal
Thought you knew
Who I was
You were wrong, oh
Never could get enough
And now I'm gone
Lights strobe across the room
But all you seem to think of is you
And
Chorus x4 'til fade
