DANSKING

You and I sit here high above
Still we hear the voices screaming from the oceans
They are not enlightened to what they're speaking of

"I'll give up my binds
I'll give up my ties to this world for you
I'll throw it all away for you, for you"

Cry it out before you deem yourself forsaken

I won't let you forget
I won't let you forget
Cry it out before you deem yourself forsaken
You should pray for forgiveness
He asks nothing but for your belief
and yet you forsake him

Take, on yourself, wings of a dream
(Still we hear the voices screaming from the oceans
I don't know what I've seen)
We will ride the skies together
(From the yielding mountains to the sinking nations
I know this feeling)
Far above the sea (of familiar corruption)

Take, on yourself, the shape of disbelief and
Your regret and fate will mirror your defeat
Fear not consequence!
But rather love your fellow man
For he is love!
Free yourself from the sins of mortal man
Be absolved from your vices

[ (Hollow, followed by encompassment)
(A feeling that somethings happening)
(Something's coming at me, can you feel it?)
I can't shake this feeling!
It's moving right through me from the floor to the ceiling
Can you see it?
Can you feel it?
I am purified
I am purified]

I won't fall to sin again, I won't fall again, I can see again
And I know I wrote about a lot of this all before
But I couldn't find the right words
I'm sorry for what I have been, I won't fall again
I can see again
I am not as selfish as I used to be

Lay your hands down, give it up
You can't supress what you have pent up, let it out
Raise your voice, lift it up
Throw your body in the air, swing your tongue
let it out (sweep through)
Feel the energy surrounding and absorbing you (sink in)
Though your spirit thrashes in excitement
Life still returns to you
