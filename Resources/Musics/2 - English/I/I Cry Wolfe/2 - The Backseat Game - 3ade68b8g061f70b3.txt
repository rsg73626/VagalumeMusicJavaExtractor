THE BACKSEAT GAME

Just imagine something sweet but oh so callously
Their eyes are always staring, watching, taking over me
As anything I do, and every single move I
S something wrong to you
I'd like to see you take it back
Just imagine sleeping easily
I hope you know I'll live what you imagine
Just imagine living peacefully
I hope you know you're just a song waiting to happen

This is our moment, this is our time to shine
Every life I changed, I will consider mine
I never said it would be easy
I never thought it would be simple
But these people need to know what I see
They need to see the beauty in everything
They need to be happy in different kinds
They need somebody to change their minds

Thoughts still hurt and words still sting
But the world isn't over like I know you think
I've heard it all before, you feel like giving up
You're the kind of person that I need to love
I'll hold no ground, I'll figure out
What it truly means to be selfless
I'll hold my breath, and take you with
We will be somewhere else forever

To those who have given up, I will go and show them love
With a fire in my heart that I can't carry anymore
I will fill them with the concepts
never thought by them before
I will drown myself in the ocean, if that will make you see
I will suffer myself, to allow someone else
I will do what I can to make them believe

And I won't stop, not until you're happy
This is the last chance to back down
After tonight there's no turning around
We're gonna face this, we're gonna face this
This is the last chance to back down
After tonight there's no turning around
We're gonna face this, we're gonna face this

Shed no tears for us as we leave it all behind
We're gonna face this, we're gonna face this
Shed no tears for the strong you will see us carry on
We're gonna face this, we're gonna face this
Shed no tears for us as you see us walk away
We're gonna face this, we're gonna face this
