A LESSON LEARNED

A Lesson Learned
There’s a rise and fall
There is a change in the atmosphere.
This has been more complicated than we’ve imagined
Write this down in letters
Send them far from here
You can count the miles but it won’t hid how close they feel

Let it go
The worst is over (Yeah, its over)
You’re moving way to fast. (Yeah, moving way to fast)

Confidence runs through your fingertips
You’ve never felt so alive
Addressed for the occasion
If gravity takes its toll you will never know what it’s like to forget him
So stand tall

Let it go
The worst is over (Yeah, its over)
You’re moving way to fast (Yeah, moving way to fast)
For all we know the worst is over
Let it go
The worst is over (Yeah, its over)
You’re moving way to fast (Yeah, moving way to fast)
For all we know the worst is over
Let’s put this in the past (Yeah, put this in the past)
Did you think that this would last?
This changes everything we know (Let it go)
