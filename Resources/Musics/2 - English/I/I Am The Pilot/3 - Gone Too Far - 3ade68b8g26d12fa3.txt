GONE TOO FAR

Gone Too Far
I’m drawn to trouble
A back door lust for her
I know it’s wrong
But I’m doing it again
My pulse is racing
My mind is chasing thoughts of the after taste of what makes me fiend for more

I’ve gone too far
And I’ll do it again
(Just for a taste of anything that’s laced with innocence)
I’ve gone too far

The morning after the damage is done for now
But I know it will come back and take me again

I’m tangled in
I’m tangled in her moves as my conscience takes the back seat to my hands that can’t refrain

I’ve gone too far
And I’ll do it again
(Just for the taste of anything that’s laced with innocence)
I’ve gone too far

I must confess that there’s nowhere left for me to go
So I’ll dive right in again
Its dark enough in here so don’t turn on the lights
Because I don’t want to appear
I’ll dive right in again
