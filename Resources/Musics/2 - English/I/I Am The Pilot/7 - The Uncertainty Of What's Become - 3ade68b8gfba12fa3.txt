THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT'S BECOME

The Uncertainty Of What's Become
We're finding out the hard way
(Whoa, Whoa)
Perfection isn't just the word that describes more then what we've become
(Whoa, Whoa)

Let me start off by saying
I'm sorry for the outcome
Of what we both thought was forever lasting
Isn't it funny that the promises we made would never see the light of day
But I'm sure you feel protected from the world tonight.

This Is becoming too routine and I'm seconds away from feeling, Uncertain about the damage that we create.

Just so you know
(Just so you know)
That you were, never
The only one that let us die before, we were alive
(You were the only one)
But this time... I'm not dying out

Cause lately I've been thinking about your contagious ways,
Of making me addicted to your triumphs
But you know you didn't have to leave,
But that was the choice that you made
So let's make matters worse
With the damage that we create.

Just so you know
(Just so you know)
That you were, never
The only one that let us die before, we were alive
(You were the only one)
But this time... I'm not dying out
(This time I'm not dying out)

In the middle of this wound, there's something that's here for you,
To take and shatter
The seconds are winding down
And I'm becoming too fit, for our worst disaster...

You were never modest
So don't hold back on me now.
Look me right into my eyes
(Look me right)
And tell me that this is worth stripping away...
