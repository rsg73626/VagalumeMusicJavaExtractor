KILLING FOR CLOSURE

Killing For Closure
Testing One, Two
Can you hear me?

The reason why you're here, is because your selfish in your own ways
And now it's your turn, to feel what others have felt for years

You can't run, you can't hide.
I'm calling all the shots
You'll never see another victory and in this finest hour I'll be composing a beautiful world.

You can't run, you can't hide.
Your consistency of breathing will never be the same again
I'm killing what I can't take care of
This is your final chance to go, to find your own way.
I'm killing what I can't take care of
This is your final chance to go, to find your own way.

I can see the air from every breath I take
The fear in your eyes is keeping you awake
My kaleidoscope of dreams has never been more fulfilling
I can see the air from every breath I take
(I can see the air from every breath I take)
The fear in your eyes is keeping you awake
My kaleidoscope of dreams has never been more fulfilling

Ten seconds there's no time to retrieve
Forgive and forget all the answers to the questions that you cherish so valuably.

I'm killing what I can't take care of
This is your final chance to go, to find your own way.

I'm killing what I can't take care of
This is your final chance to tell you, they'll miss you when you're gone
Let's test the truth in every phase that they know.

You can't run, you can't hide.
Your consistency of breathing will never be the same again
I'm killing what I can't take care of
This is your final chance to go, to find your own way.
I'm killing what I can't take care of
This is your final chance to go, to find your own way.
