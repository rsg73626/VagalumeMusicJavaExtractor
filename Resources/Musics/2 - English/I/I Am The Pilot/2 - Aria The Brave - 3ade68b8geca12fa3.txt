ARIA THE BRAVE

Aria The Brave
Just throw it away your fears have been postponed until tomorrow
So you can fall asleep tonight.
Don't forget to take your medicine dear
And wash it down with some liquid bravery.

Disguise the truth in your eyes
It's everything you want to be
Lets start this from the end

One by one in sequence lines appear to collect our thoughts in memory
(Having the courage to give it your all)
And like a dying tree we celebrate with each passing leaf
You know you couldn't find a better way
But I'm always here to follow
So lets take this for what it's worth

Disguise the truth in your eyes
It's everything you want to be
Lets start this from the end
Disguise the truth in your eyes
It's everything you want to be
Lets start this from the end

Drink Your Liquid Bravery Drink it.
(Now you won't be afraid - you were never one to.)
Drink Your Liquid Bravery Drink it.
(Now you won't be afraid - you were never one to.)

Disguise the truth in your eyes
(You lost your sight in this)
It's everything you want to be
(You lost your sight in this)
Lets start this from the end

Disguise the truth in your eyes
(Disguise the truth in your eyes)
It's everything you want to be
(It's everything you want to be)
Lets start this from the end
(Lets start this from the end)
