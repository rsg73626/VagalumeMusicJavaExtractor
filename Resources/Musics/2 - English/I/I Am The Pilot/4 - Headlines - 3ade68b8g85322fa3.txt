Headlines
Tonight's the night
Stop the copies, word from the press
We're making headlines, broadcasting worldwide to anyone who cares
This night has just begun, this isn't getting any better
Face to face we meet again and I'm not masking my words to sympathize, to your needs
Your fucking masterpiece
Just look at what you've created
This is something worth writing home about

Don't hold your breath
It's too late, I'm suffocating
This isn't the first time
So don't take my hand
This is my only hope and I'm not planning to make it alive tonight

I'm on top of the world just waiting for the chance to fall
So let's countdown the seconds to my crash landing
Make sure you're at the scene to tell tabloids what really happened
Your story is the only thing that will make a difference

Don't hold your breath
It's too late, I'm suffocating
This isn't the first time
So don't take my hand
This is my only hope and I'm not planning to make it alive tonight

Take a breath and forget about the past
Cause I will never
Take a breath and forget about the past
Cause I will, yeah I will
Take a breath and forget about the past
Cause I will never
Take a breath and forget about the past

Take a breath, take a breath and forget about me
Take a breath, take a breath and forget about the
Take a breath, take a breath and forget about the past
