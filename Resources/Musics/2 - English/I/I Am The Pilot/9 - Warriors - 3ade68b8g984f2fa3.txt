WARRIORS

Just close your eyes 
And imagine how we could survive inside these lies
The role she plays to try 
And hide the corrupted life she helped create
Marks are left
There’s no surprise with the pills she hides
She can’t deny the pillow talk that she has made me listen to her plea
Deep inside she’ll realize she can’t 
She cant hold on
In your mind you’re the cause of there demise
She screams out loud
He holds on tight
Turn around and run away
Your life is on the line again
Save your self one last time 
Don’t make a sound
He just arrived back to his home
He steps inside
Bottle in hand he feels invincible 
It’s a matter of time to cross the line
Feel the chaos rage inside
He’s out of blood and won't return till he is satisfied 
with the ending to her life
Deep inside he’ll realize he can’t 
He can’t hold on
In your mind you’re the cause of their demise 
She screams out loud
He holds on tight
Turn around and run away
Your life is on the line again
Save your self one last time
