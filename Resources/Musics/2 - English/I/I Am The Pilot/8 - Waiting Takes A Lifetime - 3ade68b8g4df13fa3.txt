WAITING TAKES A LIFETIME

Hello perfect stranger. (Where have you been?)
I’m lost with the light in your eyes. (Light in your eyes)
I know that you’re the one to take this for granted. 
Would you give yourself up and…

Follow me, (into the future now)
And let me show you, (something you won’t let go of)
A perfect reason to keep me waiting here for you.
There’s something about you I just can’t figure out.

I would never alter our design. 
I’m trying to reconsider our lives. 

It’s time to see that our real dreams 
Are made of secrets we’ve been keeping

Follow me, (into the future now)
And let me show, (something you won’t let go of)
A perfect reason to keep me waiting here for you. 
There’s something about you I just can’t figure out. 

I know nothing about perfection,
But I am certain that I am the one.
