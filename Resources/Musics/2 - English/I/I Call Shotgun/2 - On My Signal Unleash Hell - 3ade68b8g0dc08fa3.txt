ON MY SIGNAL UNLEASH HELL

Take this with you baby
So the devil will know who sent you
Lock load, take aim
At those rising up against you
We’ll scale these city walls
We’re burning it down

Set fire to this town

Looks like you’ve brought a knife
Into a fucking gunfight
Looks like you’ve brought a knife
Into a fucking gunfight

Hey you
On my signal unleash hell

Well looks like you brought a knife
Into a fucking gunfight
Looks like your out of
Touch with what you knew

We’re sacaling the walls and
We’re lighting the torches
We’re gonna burn you down

So take this with you baby
So the devil will know who sent you
Take this with you baby
So the devil will know who sent you

On..... my....... signal unleash hell

Lock load, take aim… and unleash fucking hell
