Lets see, you jive,
All of a sudden i feel like im alive
Lets go, real slow,
You make my heart race,
Just going with the flow

So if i move in for the kill
Will you be dying in my arms tonight
Does it feel so wrong and yet so right
We've got a lot to get through
Its not easy just to say goodnight
When you look that way you know im gonna bite

And we'll be dancing
With the lights out
And find out what we're all about
And we'll be dancing
With the lights out
Its time to bounce

If shooting me down kills
You fire away
Would not had this feeling yesterday
If shooting me down kills
You fire away
At least you make me feel alive

Lets see, you move,
With my two eyes i can see you've got the groove
Lets do, this right,
Just shake it like that, baby we'll be up all night
Feed me, fuck me, shut the fuck up
