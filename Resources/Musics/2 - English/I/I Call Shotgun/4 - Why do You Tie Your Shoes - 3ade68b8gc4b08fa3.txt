WHY DO YOU TIE YOUR SHOES

Why do you tie your shoes like that

This looks a good place for a showdown
Do you agree
That we’ve made the moves so its time to get down

Its just you and me
So come and take your shot
You’ve gone and made your move
So give me all you got
When our souls colide
We’re gonna make it hurt
Its my time to die
Unless i kill you first

Remember when we said we’d never die
But now for one of us theres little time
One shall stand and one shall fall tonight
Make this bullet count,

This
This could be
Be your life
Or mine
We’ll break like glass

Cmon cmon cmon cmon lets go
To the sound of the radio
Cmon cmon cmon cmon lets show
How we take all we’ve got to give
