WHATS THE MOST YOU EVER LOST

Whats the most you’ve ever lost
In a coin toss

Was this the intention
A prelude to our anialation
The intoxications more
Divine intervention
You know that we’re on our own in this
Disaster of our own making

But we are the ones
The ones who fight
To be the first to set things right
Still i am alone
This burdens mine
To bear for you all

And i am the ghost
Of a hundred thousand broken hearts
And we are the most
Inclined to say goodbye
We’ve lost control
No one can save us we’ve been let down
No one can save us we’ve been let down
Welcome to the revolution

Wont you like to know
What you wanna know
Would you like to know
What we gotta know
Wont you like to know
What you wanna know
Would you like to know
What we gotta know
