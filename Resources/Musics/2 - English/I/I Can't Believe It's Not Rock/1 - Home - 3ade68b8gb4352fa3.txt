Floating away
Fading away again
Fall from your arms
Find my feet again
Floating away
Fading away again
Fall from your arms
Find my feet again

You're coming down
You're coming round again
Facing your eyes
I'll find my way home
Floating away
Fading away again
Fall from your arms
Find my feet again

You're coming down
You're coming round again
Facing your eyes
I'll find my way home
Find my way home

Facing your eyes
I'll find my way home

Find my way home

Facing your eyes
I'll find my way home

Fall from your arms
Find my feet again

Fading away again
Fall from your arms
Find my feet again

I'll find my way home
You're coming down
You're coming round again
Facing your eyes
I'll find my way home

I'll find my way home

Facing your eyes
I'll find my way home
