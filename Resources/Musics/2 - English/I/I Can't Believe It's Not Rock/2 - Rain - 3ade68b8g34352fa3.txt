RAIN

Melting molasses
It's been raining fire far too long
Waterfall
Corroding my shelter
Levitated state
Float away from sandbag feet
As silhouettes
Fade

Your beauty's rich in a loveless world
So deformed and defined
Scrape my head off the melted floor
Violating the voices
Your beauty's rich in a loveless world
So defined by your choices
Scrape my head off the melted floor
Violating the voices

It's been raining fire far too long
It's been raining fire far too long
It's been raining fire far too long
Fade

Far from the ground, stars coming down
You're falling
Sight into sound, I'll help you down
I'm calling

(Rain)
Far from the ground, stars coming down
You're falling
Sight becomes sound, I'll help you down
You're calling

(Rain)
Far from the ground, stars coming down
You're falling
Sight into sound, I'll help you down
I'm calling

(Rain)
Far from the ground, stars coming down
You're falling
Sight becomes sound, I'll help you down
You're calling
