STAGING A TRAFFIC JAM

On the burning bridge
Staging a traffic jam
Intention stained
Upon expression

Eyes the sky's darkest clouds
Constipated mountains of condensation

Eyes the sky's darkest clouds
Constipated mountains
Eyes the sky's darkest clouds
Constipated mountains of condensation

In a sense, it's innocence
(At the start there was innocence)
(Break my heart, doesn't make no sense)
It's my only defense
(Just start again, that's the recompense)
(Just learning to fly)
On a guilt trip and
(See this chair, see this empty room)
(There's my heart, there's my open wound)
Being held hostage
(Cause the end always comes too soon)
(Just try to get by)

Eyes the sky's darkest clouds
Constipated mountains of condensation

I'll wrap my heart around you
I'll wrap my arms around you
Falling down the stairs
