PSALMS FOR THE SKY

Where were you
When my parents fell outta love
When my best friends quit talking
And the girl of my dreams lied to me?

Where were you when things fell apart
When I needed a savior
And not just some words in a book?

Were you busy with other hearts
Or am I just not important enough?

So if you allow me
To come into heaven
Would you allow me
To share this?

Oh jesus are you there for me?
I prayed hard
But I heard no one speak
Now this doesn't mean I don't believe
But jesus were you there for me?

Cause I'd forgive you for that
Cause I'd forgive you for that

You weren't there
When the tests came back positive
When the bills asked for too much
And I just didn't have enough

You weren't there when mom asked for peace
She stays on her feet and you know
She could use some release

Are you busy with other hearts
Or are we just not important enough?

So if you allow me
To come into heaven
Would you allow me
To sing this?

Oh jesus are you there for me?
I prayed hard
But I heard no one speak
Now this doesn't mean I don't believe
But jesus were you there for me?

Cause I'd forgive you for that
Cause I'd forgive you for that
