HELL

If you look into my eyes?
I'll tell you what you will see
Not the man I told you I am?
But god's greatest apologies
See, my guts are dirtier than yours?
My hearts beats inbetween my hips
These are my cards
The real me thus far
I hope you're sitting down for this

I'm just like my father
I am, the butcher of hearts
I've killed all your daughters
By admitting my lust
I should have listened to my mother
When she said come back home
Cause now the devils taken over
Down to hell?
To hell I go

If you asked where I was now
I'll tell you what I won't say
Like she's looking damn good tonight
And I might even have her stay
I'll flip over all of your pictures
And hold her closer than you
And we'll compare scars and go way to far
I know you won't forgive for this

I'm just like my father
I am, the butcher of hearts
I've killed all your daughters
By admitting my lust
I should have listened to my mother
When she said come back home
Cause now the devils taken over
Down to hell?
To hell I go

Now that you see?
What I truly am
Would you still follow me into this hell?
And carry me out?
Or will you give up?
And leave me for dead?
And be just like all of the rest
Are we worth this war?
Tell me loves you more
Are we worth this war?
Tell me who needs you more
