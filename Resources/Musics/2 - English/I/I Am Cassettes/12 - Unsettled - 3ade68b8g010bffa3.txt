UNSETTLED

Sprawled out on the floor
Swimmin in photos
I don't speak anymore
It's just not worth it
It's to much to ignore
So I submit
This just won't quit
Cause this isn't over with?

Abort the curtain drop!
Don't tell 'em we're done
Cause there's still enough stage
In this place
To get this shown

I said abort the curtain drop!
Don't tell 'em we're done
Cause there's still enough stage
In this place
To get this one
This isn't over!

This life lacks all decor
Stuck in comatose
No want to explore
It's just not worth it
It's to much to avoid
So I commit
Let this transmit?
That this isn't over with

Don't turn all the lights off!
Cause we're not done
God knows there's enough stage
In this place
To get this shown

Don't ya turn all the lights off
Cause we're just not done
Damn straight there's enough stage in this place
To get this one
This isn't over!
