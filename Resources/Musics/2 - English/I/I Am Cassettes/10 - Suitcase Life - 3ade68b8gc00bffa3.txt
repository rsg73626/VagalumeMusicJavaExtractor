SUITCASE LIFE

It's been 49 days today
Since you breathed a word to me
Which part of my brain should I believe?
That you actually miss me
You don't need me
And now don't you tell me that you'll be coming back
Cause we both know that neither of us
Even know just yetwe don't know

It's your suitcase life
I just wish you'd pick a bed and lie
Instead of leaving me in these sheets to die
Don't you
Leave me in these sheets to die
I've had enough

Are your
Hands to tied up with the bottles and keyboard to
Make your
Promises of coming back home to the one that you
Say your
Going to walk down the aisle to and say I do
Take you
Mind that just can't be made up and figure it out
Figure it out! x2

It's your suitcase life
I just wish you'd pick a bed and lie
Instead of leaving me in these sheets to die
Don't you
Leave me in these sheets to die
I've had enough
X2
