THE EXIT

Push off
And press on
You're no longer safe in my guard
I'm a poison
A pile of broken glass
There's no way I can make this last

You must move from my arms
Straight to the sun
And I'll always
Miss every bone in the body you put before me
To protect
And disinfect
Now I'll miss every moment, you made me perfect

Walk away
Don't look back
Give your eyes away to someone else
I'm a cancer
A room filled with cyanide gas
There's no way I can make this last

It's impossible
Unreachable
Out of the sight of the one you want

It's impossible
Unreachable
Out of the sight of the one you want

You must move from my arms
Straight to the sun
And I'll always
Miss every bone in the body you put before me
To protect
And disinfect
Now I'll miss every moment, you made me perfect
