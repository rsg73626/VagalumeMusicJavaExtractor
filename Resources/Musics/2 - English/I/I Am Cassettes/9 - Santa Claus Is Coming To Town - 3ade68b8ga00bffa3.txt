You better watch out
You better not cry

He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa claus is coming to town
(santa is coming to town)

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa claus is coming to town
(santa is coming to town)

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout

And checking it twice
He's gonna find out

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

So is there a time on the year
When you let all your problems go
And you know, just
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby

Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby

He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better not cry
You better not pout
