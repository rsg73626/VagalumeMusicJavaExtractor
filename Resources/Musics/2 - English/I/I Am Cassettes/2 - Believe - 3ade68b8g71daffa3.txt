BELIEVE

If you lay down your head
And rest here tonight I'll bet?
You'll stay here longer than awhile
Can we be longer that awhile?

The hands on my wrists
And my stubbly lips
Are here?
To make you feel better than the same
Can we be better than the same?

So touch down your heart
To my chest
And fix what needs fixing Cause you are?
What I believe in
You're what I believe in
Believe me?

I see that your armor is thick
And I'm not first pick
But I'll bend?
To the anatomy I know you need
Let me be what you ask of me
Please?

So touch down your heart
To my chest
And fix what needs fixing
Cause you are what I believe in
You're what I believe in
Believe me?

So touch down your heart
To my chest
And fix what needs fixing
Cause you are what I believe in
You're what I believe in
Believe me?

Believe me?
Believe me?
