SADIE (ALKALINE TRIO COVER)

You're on your own my little nightmare you cannot stay here
It's far too bright for you
If they attack you just lay there,
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through.

And seconds they seem like a lifetime.
A dream, recurring, a dream that can't come true.
And they'll pin it all on you
After all you've been put through.

"Sadie G. she's crazy, see?"
That's what the white coats say.
Now Ms. Susan A. is losing
Every opportunity to put us all away.

Go run along my little nightmare.
Your job is done here.
You've scared them all to death.
If they revive them just sit there.
Just smile dear. Make them thankful for every breath.

The sentence may seem like a lifetime,
A scream, that curdling the blood they found on you.
And your knives and clothing too.
Charlie's broken .22

"Sadie G. she's crazy, see?"
That's what the white coats say.
Now Ms. Susan A. is losing
Every opportunity.

Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way that you've bound and gaged.
You've shot and stab.
You tried to set them free, but they've thrown away the keys.

"I think that if I found a god to me that was so beautiful that I'd do anything for him. I'd do anything for god. Even murder, if I believed it was god, how could it not be right? Because he said it was. I have no remorse for the killer inside of me, I have no guilt in me"

Whoa [x4]
