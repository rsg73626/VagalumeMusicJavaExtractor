LOVERS & LIARS

It's 11:36 on a weeknight
Where are you going this hour?
A place where you shouldn't be
But you know that I won't see
So there can't be harm done

You back out the drive with the lights off
You go 85 to those arms
Get into bed with privacy
Don't care what it's done to me
So the battle is won

So take your time
It's not like this could get any worse
Cause you know I'll still love you
When you get home?

So take your time
It's not like this could get any worse
Cause you know I'll still love you
When you get home?

It's 5:55 in the morning
How was your covert affair
Was it worth all the strain and the torment
You left me in this tomb to bear

Now won't you climb back into my forgiveness
Oh, and lay your head down on my flaw
Get cozy and relived, you don't know I know a thing
Get cozy and relived, you don't know I know a thing

So take your time
It's not like this could get any worse
Cause you know I'll still love you
When you get home?

So take your time
It's not like this could get any worse
Cause you know I'll still love you
When you get home?
