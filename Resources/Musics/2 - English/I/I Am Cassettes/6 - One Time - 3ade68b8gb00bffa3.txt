ONE TIME

Me plus you (I'm a tell you one time)
Me plus you (I'm a tell you one time)
Me plus you (I'm a tell you one time)
One time, one time

When I met you girl
My heart went knock (knock)
Now the butterflies in my stomach
Won't stop (stop)

And even though it's a struggle
Love is all we got
So we gonna keep, keep climbing
Till the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (now I've got)

My one love
My one heart
My one life for sure

Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

And I'll be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you

I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

You look so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side
And troubles them don't trouble me

Many have called
But the chosen is you
Whatever you want, shawty
I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (now I've got)

My one love
My one heart
My one life for sure

Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

And I'll be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you

I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

Shawty is right there
She's got everything I need
And I'ma tell her one time
Give you everything you need
Down to my last dime

She makes me happy
I know where I'll be
Right by your side
Cause she is the one (for me)

And girl you are my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure

Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'm a tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)

And I'll be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you

I'm a tell you one time (one time)
I'm a tell you one time (one time)

Me plus you (I'm a tell you one time)
Me plus you (I'm a tell you one time)
Me plus you (I'm a tell you one time)
One time, one time
