BALLAD OF A GHOST

It's quiet around these parts?
But the echoes are so strong 
you can hear the tears from my heart
Can you hear my heart?

I'm ashamed of my own name
Stuck in slow and I'm the one to blame
Can you feel my blame?

Now I'll give my veins room to breathe
Have my eyes meet their lids and finally choose to leave
I choose to leave

With the sun turned way down low
I sink and drown into all that you left me
I'll die in these sheets

Now my life has run its course
And everybodys around to watch but you aren't home
Its cause you aren't home

Now this house has lost its love
The beds are made up and boxes are filled with our stuff
Come get your stuff
You see now what I see
Lost all faith in us and that's why I chose to leave
I chose to leave

With the sun turned way down low
You sink and drown into all that I left you
But you must pull through
Cause your life is still on course
And everybodys around to watch including me
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?
