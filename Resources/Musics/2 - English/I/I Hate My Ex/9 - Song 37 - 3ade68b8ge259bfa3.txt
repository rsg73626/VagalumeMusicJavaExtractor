SONG 37

Well good morning Boston
With your thematic sunrise
I want you to know
Everything will be alright
You’re forever on my mind
OH OH OH OH! (ding ding)
And I wont lose you this time
 
Cigarettes in open air
A winter breeze that softly runs through her hair
Midnight walks on city streets
The pavement comes to meet our feet
 
Lampposts in the distance come alive
Calling out our names as we walk by
Cant you see what you do to me
And you’d agree
 
Cigarettes in open air
A winter breeze that softly runs through her hair
Midnight walks on city streets
The pavement comes to meet our feet
 
Its all we need, to take a stroll just you and me
Frosted snow, wind fall trees blow
But here we stand
Here we stand hand in hand
 
Cigarettes in open air
A winter breeze that softly runs through her hair
Midnight walks on city streets
The pavement comes to meet our feet
