MOSQUITO VALENTINO

You’re introverted self important
Come what may
Some will say, some will say
That together is far better but only if you’re in it
 
Badly bruised and you say
“forever more forever less than today”
so long dear friend
I hope they find you
 
Separation could only last a night
Grounded by the idea of fight or flight
My brain is running out of time
Don’t you see you’re bound by the rules
I’ll say its true
 
You’ve given up on this
Friendships you’ve abridged
For self involved routine
You have betrayed, everything you are
 
Badly bruised and you say
“forever more forever less than today”
so long dear friend
I hope they find you
 
You think you’ve led me to believe
In all the things you say
That they were extraordinary
But I can see they don’t mean a shit to me
 
So crawl your way back home
Get down from that fucking throne
Together we’d burn buildings
But you betrayed, forgiveness dies
 
Badly bruised and you say
“forever more forever less than today”
so long dear friend
I hope they find you
