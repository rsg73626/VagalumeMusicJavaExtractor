OVERTURE

It’s a quarter past four in the evening
I’m waiting on those inspired feelings
And its half past five
I need to feel alive
I wish I never had to try
Don’t want to be
This passerby
And all I need is all I wanted
So I sit here still
All alone
Move in for the kill
My motto: too late for sorrow
These lines are nothing to be borrowed
Put it down I’ll finish it tomorrow
I’m done wasting rhymes
