MR.F

So you’ll say
You’re better off without me
 
Go ahead there miss
Try and make your move
I know its just a thought
I know its just a bock
But go ahead you’ve got nothing to lose
Try again like you’ll never get caught
Your higher lies and higher sense of fashion will never catch
Me off guard
 
Go go no one owes you anything
You’re ahead of the curve
Ahead of the bend
But you have to learn to use much more of your common sense
Cmon cmon you’ve got a voice
Make yourself heard its all your choice
So wear your tongue out
Make yourself known
Aren’t you sick and tired of being alone?
 
So you laugh you cry
So so so so separated from life you’d surely die
So tell us a story tell us a tale
Of a girl so desperate for attention that she’d fail
To admit she’s not herself
She’d pretend to be most anybody else
 
Go go no one owes you anything
You’re ahead of the curve
Ahead of the bend
But you have to learn to use much more of your common sense
Cmon cmon you’ve got a voice
Make yourself heard its all your choice
So wear your tongue out
Make yourself known
Aren’t you sick and tired of being alone?
 
(following is a menagerie of voices layered upon one another
in a pleasing manner)
 
SO LETS REWIND
Your life’s a lie
Don’t be so contrived
Don’t you know that better words can promise better lives
Then you’ll survive
 
Go Go noone owes you anything
You’re ahead of the curve ahead of the bend
But you have to learn to use much more of your common sense
CMON CMON you’ve got a voice
Make yourself heard its all your choice
So wear your tongue out
Make yourself known
Aren’t you sick and tired of being alone?
