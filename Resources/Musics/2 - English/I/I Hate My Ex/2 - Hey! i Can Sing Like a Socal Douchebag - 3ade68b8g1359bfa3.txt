HEY! I CAN SING LIKE A SOCAL DOUCHEBAG

She’s got a pretty face
She’ll fucking own this place
Lives by a killers code and I swear
I’ll fall for her
 
Contem-contemplating not compromising
Her jealousy runs thin
When she looks at me I can see her smiling
C'mon c'mon just let me in
She’s got curves like the Ted Williams tunnel
You crush me like a block of cement
You always gaze, and I always stumble
Cmon girl, give me a kiss
 
Lookin at you girl just makes me want to move
To see a sweet horizon to prove
I know you’re thinking all the time
You’re thinking yeah I know you’re thinking
About me and you just fucking wasting time
Chillin' with our crew
Without spending a dime
We’ll stay in these
City limits forever
So say you’re mine and I’ll be yours
