I'M NOT BAD, JUST DRAWN THAT WAY

A straight jacket
Would hold me closer than
The lies I need to spin
To stay away from your sin
And these padded walls
Never, ever, let you in
 
So tell me, why I should fear my death
You’ve come between my passion and my dreams
 
Well so much for putting hits on you
You really think that you can be my muse
But I’ve got news, I’ve got bad news
You could never walk in my world
You could never try to be my girl
And all I can say
Is try to spend a day in my dreams
 
So tell me, why I should fear my death
You’ve come between, my passion and my dreams
 
And I cant comply, please don’t end this night
And how much longer can you,
Decide that you want forever to last
 
So I sit and stare
And fold my hands
Cause you’ve got me singing
 
“Other side, with more aplomb
you’re far too young to sing along
far too, naive just breathe just breathe”
