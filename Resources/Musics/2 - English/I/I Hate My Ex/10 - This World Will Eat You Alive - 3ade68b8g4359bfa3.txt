THIS WORLD WILL EAT YOU ALIVE

So you’ve killed before
Everyone who’s knocked
On your door
You settle the score
You are so lost behind your shame
You’ll find yourself
In a forgotten name
 
From four years
I barely spent the last few days alive
Wondering why
Now don’t cry, ittle be alright ittle be alright
This is the last time
Don’t dry your eyes if you’ve got nothing to hide
 
So sweet fallen insecure
Ill fall for you and there’s more
To do or say
Maybe its better off this way
With sunken dreams and a repo smile
You calm yourself and all the while
You have changed, you cant run this game
 
From four years
I barely spent the last few days alive
Wondering why
Now don’t cry, ittle be alright ittle be alright
This is the last time
Don’t dry your eyes, if you’ve got nothing to hide
 
So much for this happy ending
You’ve spent your time constantly pretending
You’re nothing more
Than a common whore
And I will take my time
I will take my time for you
 
To all the things you could have known
The knowledge filled your soul
But you can never grow
The light, the signs of better days
Hung high and dry you’ve never
Looked so good
 
You’ve lost yourself
In past debates
You debaser you’ll know your fate
Where the past stood is where you’ll fall
