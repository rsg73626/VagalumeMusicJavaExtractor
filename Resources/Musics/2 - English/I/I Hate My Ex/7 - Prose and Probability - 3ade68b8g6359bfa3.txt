PROSE AND PROBABILITY

So you say you’re better off without me
To sink or swim, you have got to learn
 
I had a dream last night and in it were
All the people I have left behind
I cant seem to get them off mind
 
Have I betrayed where I stand?
Is it too late for this the end?
 
I’ve got to explain to you my deepest fears
I haven’t got a clue
Just how, just how, just how to break on through to blue
Those blue skies stuck in your green eyes
Have sung their siren song
And I’ve gotta say
I sang along
 
Your skyline has faded gray
Here where I stand have I betrayed?
No baby wait
To survive this tryst
We’ll have to try much harder than this
Together we’d burn buildings
But I’ll leave this town behind
 
No baby wait
You’ll end up all alone
No baby wait
Its time to challenge the unknown
No baby wait
Lets take a stroll through those
City streets where we once stood
We had our plans was this a joke?
 
Your skyline has faded gray
Here where I stand have I betrayed?
No baby wait
To survive this tryst
We’ll have to try much harder than this
Together we’d burn buildings
But I’ll leave this town behind
 
To sink or swim
You have got to learn
The water would
Never hold you under
And I hope they find you
Making yourself known
Cause you’ve got to be sick and tired
Of being alone
 
From the other side we’ll face this town
We’re far too young to give up now
Far too naïve we’ve got to breathe
We’ve got to breathe
