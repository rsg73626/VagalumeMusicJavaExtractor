COME HELL OR HIGH WATER

We sit alone on cliffs and beaches
Thinking up a few good excuses
To tell the world
But I need none, and you need something
That will make you whole
 
Just add some irony to the simile
You are like the rising tide
Too cold for me to wade in
Far too traveled for me to stand by
Go ahead and just
WALK THE PLANK
You have to learn to either
SWIM OR SINK
And when you do
Come swimming back to me
 
Severed ties have left us golden
AND WHAT IS MINE
You’ve surely stolen
From my chest
Beating heart be still
 
Do you want company?
Is it just you and me?
Forever writing lines
On borrowed time
So bury me
Six fathoms deep
In a box big enough for two
So I can spend forever saying
 
Just add some irony to the simile
You are like the rising tide
Too cold for me to wade in
Far to traveled for me to stand by
Go ahead and just
WALK THE PLANK
You have to learn to either
SWIM OR SINK
And when you do
Come swimming back to me
 
And I could neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
 
And I’ll sing you a song
That sounds a lot like this
 
(Key Change)
 
Just add some irony to the simile
Youy are like the rising tide
Too cold for me to wade in
Far to traveled for me to stand by
Go ahead and just
WALK THE PLANK
You have to learn to either
SWIM OR SINK
And when you do
Come swimming back to me
