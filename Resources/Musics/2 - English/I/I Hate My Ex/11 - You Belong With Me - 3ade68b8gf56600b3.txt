YOU BELONG WITH ME

You're on the phone with your boyfriend
He's upset, he's going off about
Something that you said
He doesn't get your humor
Like I do

And I'm in my room
It's a typical tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music
He doesn't like
And he'll never know your story
Like I do

But he wears polos, I wear T-shirts
He's team captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see me
You belong with me
You belong with me.

Walking the streets
With you and your skinny jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on the park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since he brought you down
You say you're fine
I know you better than that
Hey what are you doing with a boy like that

He wears wears ponchos, I wear sneakers
He's team captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you
See, you belong with me
(You belong with me)

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me.

Woah Woah-oh

Oh, I remember you
Driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry


I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see?
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me.

You belong with me!

Have you ever thought
Maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
