TURN THE TIDE

She's in her darkest hour
It's a domestic fight
She's gazing down the tower
She wants to take a flight

There's something with his head
Cause school is just too tough
He wants to cut his thread
His way to score enough

They're on a path of trouble
They're teamed up with despair
Their mind is one big rubble
Their life's a nightmare

We gotta see the truth
It's tough to be alive
21st century youth
We gotta turn the tide

Their life goes down the drain
Turn the tide
They lead a life of shame
We have to turn the tide
We've gotta see the truth
So turn the tide
It's tough to be alive
Turn the tide

He's bullied 'bout his skin
Nobody seems to see his skills
His race is like a sin
So he grabs for the pills

She thinks her face is wrong
Believes her boobs are small
The scorn keeps coming strong
She's got a real death call

They're so afraid to tell
They live in misery
Their hope is up for sale
It's a zero destiny

We gotta see the truth
It's strange to be alive
This puzzled online youth
We gotta turn the tide

Their life goes down the drain
Turn the tide
They lead a life of shame
Turn the tide
We've gotta see the truth
Turn the tide
It's tough to be alive
Turn the tide

She lives in cellphone town
The queen of Facebook land
Found dead, alone with a crown
She had a million friends

He loves the pride parade
He's just a gay old boy
They served him daily hate
He turned on self-destroy

Their life goes down the drain
So turn the tide
They lead a life of shame
We have to turn the tide
We've gotta see the truth
Turn the tide
It's tough to be alive
Turn the tide

Their life goes down the drain
Turn the tide
They lead a life of shame
We have to turn the tide
We've gotta see the truth
Turn the tide
It's tough to be alive
Turn the tide
