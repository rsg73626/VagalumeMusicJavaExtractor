ANOTHER ROUND

She came out of the blue like it was nothing
(It was nothing)
Made my heart melt for a day but you're frozen
(but you're frozen)
And now that I'm down down on my knees girl
I'm looking for somebody to save me
(somebody to save me)
Cause I don't know where I want
For how long can somebody please explain to me
Now please please let me breathe
Please return my life before you leave
Oh I see oh yeah I see that there's poison on your lips
But I still want this kiss
And you blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Go buy another round
Go buy another round

I'm such a bad player when it comes to this game oh oh oh
? isn't heavy and? it feels strange
And now that I'm down down on my knees girl
I'm looking for somebody to save my world
And every single pieces pieces
I found to your heart makes me feel a dork
Now please please let me breathe
Please return my life before you leave
Oh I see oh yeah I see that there's poison on your lips
But I still want this kiss
And you blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Go buy another round
Go buy another round

Baby you was ment to go this way
Even if it hurts to say that I'm in pain
And you blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Go buy another round
Go buy another round
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Blame me, fool me, shut me down
Go buy another round
Go buy another round
