AUTOGRAPH (ENGLISH VERSION)

It was just another day hanging on the level
Weather incredible waiting daydreaming 'bout you
Then I saw you pass my way, looked just like in the magazine
Made my heartbeat stop pop I was onto you

Oh-oh oh-oh
It's got me thinking superstar
Oh-oh oh-oh
The way you shine from so far
Oh-oh oh-oh
You had me caught up in your limelight
And it feels so right

It's like that
You really got me going so crazy
It's like this
Wish you and me could be together
It's like that
'Cause baby you're my everything
Can I get your autograph au-au-au autograph?

It's like that
You really got me chasing like crazy
It's like this
No I don't want to wait forever
It's like that
'Cause baby you're the world to me
Can I get your autograph au-au-au autograph?

No never did I think
That I could ever feel this way
Your lightening struck once
Now you're stuck up in my memory
I know I'm aiming high
But wish somehow you would notice me
I believe that someday I'll be in your gallery

Oh-oh oh-oh
It's got me thinking superstar
Oh-oh oh-oh
The way you shine from so far
Oh-oh oh-oh
You had me caught up in your limelight
And it feels so right

It's like that
You really got me going so crazy
It's like this
Wish you and me could be together
It's like that
'Cause baby you're my everything
Can I get your autograph au-au-au autograph?

It's like this
No I don't want to wait forever
It's like that
'Cause baby you're the world to me
Can I get your autograph au-au-au autograph?

Don't wanna be a face, face in the crowd
Another fan always hanging around
'Cause baby you're everything
You are my shining star
And when the lights, lights come down
Can I be the one that you're be calling around
You're my everything, my everything
You mean the world to me
