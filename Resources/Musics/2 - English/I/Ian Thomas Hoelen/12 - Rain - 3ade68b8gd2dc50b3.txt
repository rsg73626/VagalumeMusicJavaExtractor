RAIN

So this was our life
And this was our world
I'ma keep driving till I find you
And I don't know how
But all I know now is that I won't stop
Until I do so I keep looking out I'ma keep it going I cant think about
Anything but knowing what this is all about
The way I feel about you and every time I do I feel the

Rain rain rain, I think of loving you again gain gain
And when I do I feel the pain pain pain, the thunder coming back again
And you know that

I can feel the raindrops, the raindrops I can feel the rain

Yeh yeh so so these thunderstorms keep rollin', these heavy clouds keep bowling
I feel like an avalanche I'm so cold and I keep falling
My heavy heart is full of pain and all the rain keeps falling
My eyes go to the bang
And I know that I keep looking out I'ma keep it going I can't think about, anything but knowing what this is all about, the way I feel about you
And every time I do I feel the

Rain rain rain, I think of loving you again gain gain
And when I do I feel the pain pain pain, the thunder coming back again
And you know that

Rain rain rain, gain gain gain
Pain pain pain, gain gain gain, and every time I do I feel the
Rain rain rain, gain gain gain
Pain pain pain, gain gain gain, and every time I do I feel the

Rain rain rain, I think of loving you again gain gain
And when I do I feel the pain pain pain, the thunder coming back again
And you know that
I can feel the rain drops the rain drops
I can feel the rain
Rain rain rain
