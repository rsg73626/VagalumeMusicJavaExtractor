LA LA LAND

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

If you wanna be a star girl
I spent dollars on your feet
This may be in a dream girl
I'll protect you everywhere
If we fall down below girl
Catch one time I'll be there
So bound to your love girl
Take you for this day second

You make me fly so far
And take it high to the galaxy
I will take you away
Take you to lalalala land
You make me fly so far
And take it high to the galaxy
I will take you away
Take you to lalalala land
Lalalala land

Backseat of a taxi
Playing blackstreet with you
Worry the maxi
Dress, yess
You got me charge my batteries
You got the love like cards in a factory
While actually you got passion
Love your ascety in fashion

Fly so far
And take it high to the galaxy
I will take you away
Take you to lalalala land
You make me fly so far
And take it high to the galaxy
I will take you away
Take you to lalalala land
Take you to lalalala land
Lalalala land

Listen today
The day goes away
The night only play tonight
The stars fill the sky
We're feeling allright
The night's only play
