JESUS IS THE ROCK

The stroke the Lord lays
On them with His grace
Will be to the music of drums and guitars,
As he fights them,
He fights in battle
With the blows of His arm.

Pre chorus
And you'll sing as on
The night you celebrate a holy song;
Your hearts will rejoice
When you hear His majestic voice
From the mountain of the Lord,
To the rock of world.

Chorus:
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus is the rock

Praise be to the Lord my Rock,
Who trains my hands for war,
My fingers for battle.
He is the rock,
That make me strong
A faithful God who does no wrong,
