END OF SACRIFICE

I cry out to God
Before I turn away
Hiding the hate that burns inside me
Fake angels lie
To stay in control
Building it up to break it back down

Find a meaning for what is going on
Love will fill you with hope again

[Chorus]
There is peace in the end of... In the end of sacrifice
Let your light burn inside of me
In the end of... In the end of sacrifice
Keep searching for a meaning!

Stand up, you'd better face it
Should it be all you expect of fate?
So brake your chains
There's no one else to blame
Only you hold the key, to make your fate

Find a meaning for what is going on
Love will fill you with hope again

[Chorus]
