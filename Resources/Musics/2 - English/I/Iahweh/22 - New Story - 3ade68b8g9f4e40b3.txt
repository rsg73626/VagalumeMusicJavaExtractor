NEW STORY

Hello, I'm the lie, living inside of you
Filling the emptiness of your soul
I felt you left me
When I screamed asking for help
Where were you when I cried?

How quickly life can turn around
Life can turn around

Let's start a new story with you
From the strength that comes from me
Now you know where you belong
Although you hurt you must
You must be strong

Who will be there
To catch me when I fall?
I need to hear your voice
I can see I'm lost
If there's a purpose in life at all there
Must be a purpose in dying too

You couldn't hate enough to love
You couldn't have enough

Let's start a new story with you
From the strength that comes from me
Now you know where you belong
Although you hurt you must
You must be strong

You must be strong
Yeah
