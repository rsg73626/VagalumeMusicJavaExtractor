HOLD ON STRONG FOR YOUR LIFE

Who cares how you feel when you find yourself alone?
Another fable, another promise
So change your soul, turn it up, set yourself free
Don't let darkness break it all

Go find your peace, a chance to feel alive
Go make the time

In the middle of every heartbeat
Hold on strong for your life
Just don't lose your hope
In the middle of every heartbeat
Hold on strong for your life
For your life

Who's gonna save you now since everybody's gone?
Broken homes and broken lives
A million tears are falling just like rain
Making a river of fears

Go find your peace, a chance to feel alive
Go make the time

In the middle of every heartbeat
Hold on strong for your life
Just don't lose your hope
In the middle of every heartbeat
Hold on strong for your life
For your life

The walls fall down like silent screams
No matter who you are
I hear your voice crying freedom here
With a feeling so pure
Sadness won't control you anymore

In the middle of every heartbeat
Hold on strong for your life
Just don't lose your hope
In the middle of every heartbeat
Hold on strong for your life
For your life
