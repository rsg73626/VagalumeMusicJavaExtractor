PULL THE PLUG

Somebody wake me up

Breathe in and breathe out
That's what I tell myself
When the voices inside say
That I won't survive
When did I become so cold and so numb?
To the hope in my mind
To the fire drowning inside

Wake me up, I'm seconds from the end
I'm dying to feel, I've been dying to live
Will somebody give me a sign
So I know I'm alive?
It's time to wake me up, or pull the plug

Somebody wake me up

Am I better off dead, is it all in my head?
There's a snake in my mind
Spitting venom and lies
It runs through my veins
Paralyzed by the pain
I'm at the end of my rope
As it's placed around my throat

Wake me up, I'm seconds from the end
I'm dying to feel, I've been dying to live
Will somebody give me a sign
So I know I'm alive?
It's time to wake me up, or pull the plug

I can't wake up

I've been screaming but no words come out
You can't hear me, it's just silence now
Trapped in a nightmare
With my eyes sewn shut
Is this what I've become? somebody

Wake me up, I'm seconds from the end
I'm dying to feel, I've been dying to live
Will somebody give me a sign
So I know I'm alive?
It's time to wake me up, or pull the plug

Pull the plug
Somebody wake me up
