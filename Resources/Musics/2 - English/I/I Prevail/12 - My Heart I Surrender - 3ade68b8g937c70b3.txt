MY HEART I SURRENDER

I'm a ghost in your eyes
A shadow you can't seem to recognize
I have a thought of you for every, star in the sky
But I'm scared, I'll never cross your mind
Yeah, I'm scared

Will our stars ever align?
Will two hearts, beat in time?
These words you should always remember
To you, my heart I surrender
Chasing love that can never be mine
Maybe one day you'll realize
These words you should always remember
To you, my heart I surrender

And I can't count the times
I stayed awake pretending you were mine
Now I'm left here with this emptiness inside
Why can't I make you mine?

Will our stars ever align?
Will two hearts, beat in time?
These words you should always remember
To you, my heart I surrender
Chasing love that can never be mine
Maybe one day you'll realize
These words you should always remember
To you, my heart I surrender

Will our stars ever align?
Will two hearts, beat in time?
These words you should always remember
To you, my heart I surrender
Chasing love that can never be mine
Maybe one day you'll realize
These words you should always remember
To you, my heart I surrender
