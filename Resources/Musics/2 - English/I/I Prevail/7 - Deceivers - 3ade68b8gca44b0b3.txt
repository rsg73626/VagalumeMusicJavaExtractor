DECEIVERS

I was so wrong to believe all of you
Every time I open my eyes
I see the darkness come through
The darkness come through

I see the world through the undertow
These anchors of hope, they drag me down below
Put my faith in ones who promised change
But where has it gotten me?

A broken dreamer, from a, corrupted preacher
A vagabond, without a home
I've been cursed to wander
All alone

Cuz' I've been buried alive
I've been buried
But I still have hope inside, yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I was so wrong to believe all of you
Every time I open my eyes
I see the darkness come through
If that's whats left of me, to live my life aimlessly
I'll search for a light, a way to fight, until the world
Collapses on me
Collapses on me

What good comes from the hands of a thief
The words of a beggar
The mind of a coward
The heart of a sinner
The hands dug the grave
And the words threw me in
The minds still caved shut
But my hearts still beating

Cuz' I've been buried alive
I've been buried
But I still have hope inside, yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I was so wrong to believe all of you
Every time I open my eyes
I see the darkness come through
If that's whats left of me, to live my life aimlessly
I'll search for a light, a way to fight, until the world
Collapses on me

Collapses on me
Collapses on me
Collapses on me

Is this it?
Have I spent, a lifetime of regret
Not knowing, what I want
Giving up all of my thoughts
But I've changed, who I am
I'll start over again
Change my ways, change my life
I am finally alive
