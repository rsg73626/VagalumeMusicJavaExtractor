SCARS

Excuses, Excuses are all that I hear
all I can see when I look in the mirror
I can't escape all 
These thoughts in my mind
they're waiting to haunt me
Night after night

I feel it in my bones and everything I know
It's underneath my skin and it won't let go
They know me all too well
But only time will tell
If this is who I am, do I know myself?

Don't forget your life's your own
Don't ever let it go

In the heat of the moment
When fear has you frozen
Crashin and burnin, when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are
They can cut us but we'll wear our scars
In the heat of the moment
When fear has you frozen
Crashin and burnin, when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are
Try to tear us apart
But know that we'll wear our scars
Try to tear us apart
But know that we'll wear our scars

Denial, Denial is all that I've known
holding me hostage I'm never alone
I'm fighting for air
I fight for my life
My soul's not for sale
 I won't pay the price

I feel it in my bones and everything I know
It's underneath my skin but I won't let go
Won't let go

In the heat of the moment
When fear has you frozen
Crashin and burnin, when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are
They can cut us but we'll wear our scars
In the heat of the moment
When fear has you frozen
Crashin and burnin, when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are
Try to tear us apart
But know that we'll wear our scars

You can cut us up but we will survive
You had your chance
Now it's our time to stand up and
Rise Rise Rise Rise Rise Rise

In the heat of the moment
When fear has you frozen
Crashin and burnin, when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are

They can cut us but we'll wear our scars
In the heat of the moment
When fear has you frozen
Crashin and burnin, when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are

Try to tear us apart
But know that we'll wear our scars
In my bones and everything I know
I feel it in my bones, in my bones
Know that I'll wear my scars, my scars
Know that I'll wear my scars
