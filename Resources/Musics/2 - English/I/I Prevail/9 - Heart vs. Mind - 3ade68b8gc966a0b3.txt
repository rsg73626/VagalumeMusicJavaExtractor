HEART VS. MIND

(The heart against the mind, mind, mind...)
I can feel it taking over me

This is a declaration
Of a war fought behind a veil
This is a revelation
As told through the age old tale
In which I've heard a thousand times before
Nothing matters anymore
And I'm reminded as I stare at this revolving door
Of all the times I've failed
And all the times I've sworn
I'd never give up hope
And change what I stand for

I'm just a stranger
who made a wager for my life
I'm afraid that, so afraid that
I might not escape this time
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air
This is the heart against the mind
This is the heart against the mind

My life is on the line
it seems as if I'm running out of time
And my thoughts are consuming me
Is this the person I'm suppose to be?
It's like the fear of being buried alive
The more I try, the more I die inside
I struggle to keep my dreams while awake
But the fear grows inside and puts me to sleep

I'm just a stranger
who made a wager for my life
I'm afraid that, so afraid that
I might not escape this time
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air
This is the heart against the mind

The war rages on, but I will not quit
I've seen countless souls fall down that pit
The walls doubt built up, will fall to the ground
I'll rise back up, I won't be held down!

I'm just a stranger
who made a wager for my life
I might not escape this time
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air
This is the heart against the mind
This is the heart against the mind
This is the heart against the mind
(The heart against the mind
I can feel it taking over me.)
