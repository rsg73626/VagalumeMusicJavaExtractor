ALREADY DEAD

I'd pull the trigger but you're already dead
If I could bring you back to life I would kill you again

Tell me now how do you sleep at night?
With the devil in your bed laying right by your side
And as you count all your dollars
you can count down the days
Cause when it's all said and done
I'll fucking spit on your grave

I would pull the trigger but you're already dead
If I could bring you back to life, I would do it all again
And I looked in your eyes as it all came to an end
I swear if I could bring you back to life, I'd kill you again
I'd kill you again

Tell me how do you live with yourself?
Lives are falling apart
while you're consumed by your wealth
The blood is on your hands and your skin's stained red
But when I'm done with you
you'll beg for your last breath

I would pull the trigger but you're already dead
If I could bring you back to life, I would do it all again
And I looked in your eyes as it all came to an end
I swear if I could bring you back to life, I'd kill you again

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
I pulled the trigger and I sent you to hell
These are my final words to you, go fuck yourself
