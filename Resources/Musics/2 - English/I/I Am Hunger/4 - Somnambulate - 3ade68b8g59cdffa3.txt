SOMNAMBULATE

And it goes back to where I always begin,
Keeping all my hopes up high.
There's just no chance too breath in,
And the moment's gone.
Can't cope with life no more,
So I close my eyes.
In hope of better days,
I close my eyes.
But days never comes,
They're just rushing by.
If I could I would change it all.
But I can't, and 'hope' keeps telling lies,
So I close my eyes.
And I know how it's supposed to end,
But I'm throwing myself in with all that I've got.
And when air is all I see, free falling will you catch me?
Cause I've put my trust in few,
Still those I love keep slipping through my fingertips.
Just cause I needed them more than they needed me,
All those I cared for is far out of reach.
In times of need, I'm left alone against the world.
Cursed.
