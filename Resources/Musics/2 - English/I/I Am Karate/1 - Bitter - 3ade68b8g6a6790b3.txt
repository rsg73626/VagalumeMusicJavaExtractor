BITTER

Why keep it simple?
Send me round the bend, and back again
Why make it easy on ourselves?
Why keep it simple?
Just leave me hanging here
Here in thin air

I wanna be away from you
Wanna text and call, get no answer at all
I wanna wonder where you are
Why keep it simple?
Give me nothing in return
Twist and turn

You got the brightest of eyes
But now they're darker than ever
I tell the sweetest of lies
Still it all taste so bitter

Bitter

I never wanted so so
I blame it all on you, there's nothing you can do
I wanted to see you lose your mind
Why keep it simple?
But I know it's really me
Cause I tear things down

You got the brightest of eyes
But now they're darker than ever
And I tell the sweetest of lies
Still it all taste so bitter

Bitter
