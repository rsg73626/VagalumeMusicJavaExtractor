FALLING ON EVERLASTING

where the earth meets the sunrise they are waking we
are waking 
they are falling on everlasting arms that carry arms
that carry out 

go and tell the whole world its alright its alright 
go and tell the whole world its alright its alright 

my God is sovereign and strong and his will is ours to
live 
all fall short again 

go and tell the world tell the world of his beautiful
name 
go tell the world we all fall short your all I live
for 

go and tell the whole world its alright its alright 
go and tell the whole world its alright its alright

you are found in the birth in the birth of everlasting
love 
found in your everlasting love 

all fall short again
