VELVET THUNDER

This is a test for all who seek too
Have the freedom of speech forever
And consequently I am hear to speak to you
With the truth and love from our Father

So follow the Leaders and 
Ill meet you there. In time
To show you the beauty.
In humble traditions. In time

And its something you cant see
Something that hides behind the seems
Through the seems
With every tempo and every key
Every song and melody
YOU HAVE PERFECTED PRAISE

Leaders we should be boldly to say
Leaders we should be boldly 

This is a test for all humanity
So where's the love

Leaders you should be boldly
You should be boldly to say

You are forever and we will together
Praise Your name 
All through the Heavens skies
Through the skies
