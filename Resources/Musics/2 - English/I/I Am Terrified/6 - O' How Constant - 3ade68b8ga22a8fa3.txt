O' HOW CONSTANT

today I change and tomorrow I'll change again this
change is constant i will change again i promise this
to you it cannot hold constant with the future all
aspects of life have the power to change the face of
uncertainty to that of definite assurance does this
mean that ill revert to my old self o no not likely
this change is constant a new light shines upon me see
but a new light will shine upon my countenance this
change is constant it is daily that He reconstructs my
heart assurance accusations acquitted finger pointing
forgotten beliefs buried reputation refined no
questions ask this will change everything just as you
have changed me i will change them march on to victory
behold He makes all things new
