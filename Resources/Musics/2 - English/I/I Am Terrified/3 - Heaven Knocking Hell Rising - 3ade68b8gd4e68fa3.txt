HEAVEN KNOCKING HELL RISING

Wake up, and Put on your Armor....
We rush to the Battle Scene....
Fire and Brimstone we will bring to the fight
and Souls will be lifted from here to the sky
and He will descend from the clouds
Like a thief in the night

These trials seem so long...
and the days i feel are killing...
but my hands will clench to yours
when it seems like i am falling
BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE

Welcome, welcome
is the first thing you do to me always
When i've been so far away
And you are the best thing
That has happened to me and
Forever i'll worship You

This is the end hear it comes
This is the end that we're in
Haven't you heard Havent you

The dead will rise

AWAKE THE BRIDE

And it's such a chore for me
Just to see the world is ending

But the news paper writes and
The television screams
That this is the end
So haven't you felt the love of Christ
Haven't you felt Jehovah's Love...

One day we'll see your face...

One day... Your welcome

Welcome, welcome
is the first thing you do to me always
When i've been so far away
And you are the best thing
That has happened to me and
Forever i'll worship You

This is the end hear is comes
Haven't you heard...............
