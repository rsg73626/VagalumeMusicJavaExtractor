MAY KILLS THE CALENDAR

You have made me see troubles many and bitter You will
restore my life again from the depths of the earth you
will again bring me up) could You turn the page for me
this month has shown its ugly apologetic face around
again and I cannot seem to look these wounds seem to
grow this is the way that may glows thirty days come
and go this is the way may glows my loves heart pale
take this time to rest my dear and burn the summer and
thank you Lord from where you've brought us from we're
turning over we're turning over the calendar this year
time has come and all we have is your Love to take back
what satan has stolen form us He will restore me cause
you've said it He will restore me because everything i
have and everything i was is so much better now and i
will swear to you i will never be the same because by
His strip He said i am always healed by Your strips
You said i am always healed these wounds seem to know
this is the way that may glows thirty days come and go
"and one day more" this is the way may glows.
