AND SOULS SING

I surrender all of me to You my God and King You have
set my heart on fire for You my soul will ablaze are
you ready for heavens shore whispers from heaven turn
my eyes attention from sin this world has come to love
to make this secret means eternal life for all is all
in vain and is rightly so now my soul will wing
listening for You is all my soul can do CHRIST died
for all sinners and HE died for you...i will not keep
silent. my salvation reigns in me Jesus saves...
