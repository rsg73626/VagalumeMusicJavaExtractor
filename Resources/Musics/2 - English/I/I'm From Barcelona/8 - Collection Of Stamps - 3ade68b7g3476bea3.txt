COLLECTION OF STAMPS

I've got one from Spain
and two from Japan
I've got a couple from Israel and Azerbadjan  
I've got a plenty from Poland but none from Sudan
or from Fiji or Uzbekistan

You know I can't believe I'm telling everyone that I know
That every stamp in my collection is a place we could go!

I've got a couple from India and Benin as well
I've got a plenty from Poland but none from Sudan
or from Fiji or Uzbekistan

You know I can't believe I'm telling everyone that I know
That every stamp in my collection is a place we could go!
