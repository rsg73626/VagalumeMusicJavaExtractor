HEADPHONES

They can take me anywhere I want
I put my headphones on,
I put my headphones on

I can walk around and sing along
I put my headphones on,
I put my headphones on

They can take me anywhere I want
I put my records on
I put my records on

You can shake your head
and turn around,
I put my records on
I put my records on

Now I'm gone, with my head in a cloud
and the songs, they're just dancing around

Now I'm gone, with my head in a cloud and the songs, they're just dancing around around around
around around around
