RUFUS

Rufus, the giant silver labrador
Is standing in my hall
Rufus, Rufus labrador
Ten feet tall

Are you coming to get me now?
Are you coming to get me now?
Are you coming to get me now
To take me home?

He found me in the catalogue
One day he made a call
He said that he was coming now
To take me home

Are you coming to get me now?
Are you coming to get me now?
Are you coming to get me now
To take me home?

I know exactly how you feel
You can't believe that it is real
I know exactly how you feel
You can't believe that it is real
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I know
I've got ten little fingers to hold on as we go
Yeah, I know
I've got ten little fingers to hold on as we go

Rufus is a mighty one
He's going right into the sun
He's flying like a bullet from a gun
He's going right into the sun

Rufus is a mighty one
He's going right into the sun
He's flying like a bullet from a gun
He's going right into the sun

I am going far beyond
Far away, you know
And I'm so sad you couldn't come
To where I'm going to

I am going far beyond
Far away, you know
And I'm so sad you couldn't come
To where I'm going to

In my heart
In my heart
Still a kid

In my heart
In my heart
Still a kid
