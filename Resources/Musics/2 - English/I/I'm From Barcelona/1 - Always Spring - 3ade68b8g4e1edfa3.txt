ALWAYS SPRING

I wanna be fast
I wanna be slow
I want somewhere to go

I wanna be high
I wanna be low
I want it all you know

I wanna be good
I wanna be bad
I need some satisfaction

I wanna be up
I wanna be down
I need a new direction

Somewhere it's summer
Somewhere it's always spring

I wanna be young
I wanna be old
I don't know where to go

I wanna be yes
I wanna be no
I want it all you know

Somewhere it's summer
Somewhere it's always spring
