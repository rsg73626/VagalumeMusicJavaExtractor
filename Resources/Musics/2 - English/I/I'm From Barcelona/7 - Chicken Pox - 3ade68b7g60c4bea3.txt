CHICKEN POX

As a kid I had the chicken pox
the german measles and the scarlet fever
and I don't ever want to go through that again

I had to tell my little broken heart
I had to tell it I'm immune to love
'cause I don't ever want to go through that again

You can't have it once you've had it
You can't have it once you've had it
You can't have it once you've had it, no
