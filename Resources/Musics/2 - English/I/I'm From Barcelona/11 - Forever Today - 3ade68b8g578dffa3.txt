FOREVER TODAY

We've been hanging around
We've been hanging around
So many times before
So many times before

We've been falling in love
Yeah, we've been falling in love
We're gonna miss it all
We're gonna miss it all

Ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah

We didn't hear every note
We didn't know every rule
We did it anyway
We did it anyway

We didn't do all the dos
I guess we did all the don'ts
We're gonna miss this place
We're gonna miss this place

Do what you do and do it all the way
Go where you go, it's gonna be okay
Do what you do and do it all the way
Go where you go, it's gonna be okay

Do what you do and do it all the way
Go where you go, it's gonna be okay
Do what you do and do it all the way
Go where you go, it's gonna be okay

Ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah

Ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
