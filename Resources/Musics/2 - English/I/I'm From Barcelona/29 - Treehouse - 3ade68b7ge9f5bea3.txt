TREEHOUSE

I have built a treehouse
I have built a treehouse
Nobody can see us
it's a you and me house

I've been climbing rocks and stones
been collecting broken bones
I've been swimming across the lakes
just to find this perfect place
I got lost into the woods
I've been covered up in mud
I've been going through a lot
just to find this perfect spot
