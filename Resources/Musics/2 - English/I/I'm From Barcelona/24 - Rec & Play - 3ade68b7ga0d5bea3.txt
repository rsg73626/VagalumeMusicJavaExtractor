REC & PLAY

Feeling like a tape recorder
stuck between rewind and forward
Always going two directions
One's ahead and the second is backwards

Please press my rec and play
'cause I want to save this moment
This will be my favourite song
This will be my favourite album

I will throw my tapes away 'cause
this will be the one worth saving
Push the faders break the meters
rolling, rolling, time to get going
