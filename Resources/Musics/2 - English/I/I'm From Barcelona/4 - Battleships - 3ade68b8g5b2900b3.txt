BATTLESHIPS

We got shooting stars, fireworks and neon lights
We got elephants and acrobats for you tonight
We're sending battleships, submarines and satellites
I just wanted to see you, my honey
We got everything you ever wanted here tonight
I just wanted to see you, my honey

Everybody's got bellies full of butterflies
I just wanted to see you, my honey
We got everything you ever wanted here tonight
I just wanted to see you, my honey

We're sending battleships, submarines and satellites
I just wanted to see you, my honey
We got everything you ever wanted here tonight
I just wanted to see you, my honey

I just wanted to see you, my honey
I just wanted to see you, my honey
I just wanted to see you, my honey
I just wanted to see you, my honey

I just wanted to see you, my honey
I just wanted to see you, my honey
I just wanted to see you, my honey
I just wanted to see you, my honey

We're sending battleships, submarines and satellites
We got everything you ever wanted here tonight
We're sending battleships, submarines and satellites
We got everything you ever wanted here tonight
