MUSIC KILLED ME

Music almost killed me now
I don't understand
Music almost took my life
Things got out of hand
Music almost killed me now
I don't understand
Music almost took my life
I don't give a damn

She almost killed me now
She almost took my life

She almost killed me now
She almost took my life

I don't ever want to come down
From here to there
I don't ever want to come down
Oh dear, oh dear

I don't ever want to come down
From here to there
I don't ever want to come down
Oh dear, oh dear

But it doesn't really matter anymore
Because you have to take some chances, I suppose

It doesn't really matter anymore
Because you have to take some chances, I suppose

Wait until tomorrow
If you like to kill me, dear
Wait until tomorrow
Because I like it down here

Wait until tomorrow
If you like to kill me, dear
Wait until tomorrow
Because I like it down here

Kind of like it down here
Kind of like it down here
