MINGUS

You got a four wheel drive
You got a kid and a wife
You got a pretty little country house
You got a job you hate
You get home to late
Do you remember what we use to say

Oh my god, I'll end up just like you
Oh my god, I'll end up just like you

I've got a way to live
That pulls me apart
Will I always have a broken heart
And if I ever grow up
(ever grow up...)
And if I give it a shot
(give it a shot...)
Will I remember what we use to say

Oh my god, you will be just like me
Oh my god, you will be just like me

In my heart, In my heart, still a kid
In my heart, In my heart, still a kid
