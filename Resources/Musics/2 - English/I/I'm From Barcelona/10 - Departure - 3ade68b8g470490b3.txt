DEPARTURE

I'm getting ready for departure
I think I'm ready pretty soon
Or will you see me when you're out there
Or will you see me on the moon

And soon I'm standing at the gate
We'll be together, me and you
I'm pretty sure I won't be late
We'll be together, me and you
We'll be together, me and you

I'm getting ready for departure
I think I'm ready pretty soon
Or will you see me when you're out there
Or will you see me on the moon

And soon I'm standing at the gate
We'll be together, me and you
I'm pretty sure I won't be late
We'll be together, me and you
We'll be together, me and you

We'll be together, me and you
