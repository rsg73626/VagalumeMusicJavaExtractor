BRITNEY

Why did we care if good old Britney wants to shave her head?
Why did we care well I've been thinkin' you've been thinking too
They don't know a thing about you
I'm gonna get a tattoo
'Cause girl i want to look like you 
Why did we care if good old Britney wants a new tattoo?
Why did we care? 
'Cause i need one and you need something too

They don' tknow a thing about you
I'm gonna get a tattoo
'Cause girl i wanna look like you

Everything you got
I gotta get it to you
Can i get just a little of your attitude?
