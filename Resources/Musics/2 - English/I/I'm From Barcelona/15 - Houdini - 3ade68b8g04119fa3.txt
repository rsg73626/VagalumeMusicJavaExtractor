HOUDINI

Yes, I am trying to figure it out
You must have some special powers, all right
No, I'm not sure how you're working things out
You must have some special powers, all right

You're like Houdini
No one else would believe me
But I know the things you do
Yes I know, yes I know, yes I know that it's true

Black magic ain't supposed to working these days
That's why I find it so hard to believe
That you ain't got connections with any ghost
Or any spirit who's setting you free
Setting you free

You're like Houdini
No one else would believe me
But I know the things you do
Yes I know, yes I know, yes I know that it's true

And then you're like Houdini
No one else would believe me
You're like Houdini, use your powers to free me

You're like Houdini, you're like Houdini
You're like Houdini, you're like Houdini
You're like Houdini, use your powers to free me

You're like Houdini, you're like Houdini
You're like Houdini, yeah!
