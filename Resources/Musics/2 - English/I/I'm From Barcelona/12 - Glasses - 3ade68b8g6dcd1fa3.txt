GLASSES

I don't want to wear glasses
though I know that I should
so I have to take chances
when i walk through the hood

if you see me say hi
and you don't really know me
it's not that I'm nice
it's just that I can't see, don't want to wear glasses

I don't want to wear glasses
don't want to wear glasses
I don't want to wear glasses...
