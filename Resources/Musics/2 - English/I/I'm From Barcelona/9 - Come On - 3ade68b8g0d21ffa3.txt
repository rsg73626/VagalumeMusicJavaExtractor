COME ON

Oh yeah I'm talking to you
I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do

You're gonna work so hard
You gotta work until you're 65

Come on, come on
You got to take it easy now

Come on, come on
Come on into the city lights

Oh yeah I'm talking to me too
This is a matter of both me and you

We're gonna work so long
We got to find a way to stay alive

Come on, come on
You got to take it easy now

Come on, come on
Come on into the city lights

You got to give in
You got to let go
You got to be free
So let's go
