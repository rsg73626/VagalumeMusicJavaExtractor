THIS BOY

When I wake up in the morning and I'm feeling alright
when I stumble into bed another Saturday night
all the voices in my head and all the people I meet
they're all trying so hard to make a man out of me

But there's always gonna be this little boy inside of me
And there's always gonna be this little girl inside of me
