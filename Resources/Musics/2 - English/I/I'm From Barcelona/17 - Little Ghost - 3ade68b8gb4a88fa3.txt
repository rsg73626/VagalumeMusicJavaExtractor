LITTLE GHOST

I know that I'm scary
But you don't have to afraid
I'll come another Tuesday
I'll come another Saturday

Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost

Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost

I hope you won't leave me
I only want to be your friend
I know you can't see me
I'm happy if you could pretend,
that you're

Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost

Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost

Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost
Watching a ghost

Touching a ghost
Touching a ghost
Touching a ghost

Way up over my head, little ghost
What will they say when I'm dead, little ghost
Way up over my head, little ghost
What will they say when I'm dead, little ghost
