GUNHILD (FEATURING SOKO)

I know that you are hiding in there
I know that you are hiding in there
Can I let you out?

And if I let you out
Is it ok if I let you out?
If I let you out
Just for a while
Is it all right?

And if I let you out
Is it ok if I let you out?
If I let you out
Just for a while
Is it all right?

Because it's only water in your eyes
And it's only words out of my mouth
It's only me out there tonight
And it's only I want to find

It's only water in your eyes (water in my eyes)
It's only words out of my mouth (words out of your mouth)
It's only me out there tonight
And it's only I want to find

I know that you are hiding in there
I know that you are hiding in there
Can I let you out?
