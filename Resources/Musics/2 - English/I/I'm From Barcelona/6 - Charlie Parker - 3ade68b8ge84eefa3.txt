CHARLIE PARKER

There is a bird
For every occasion
I wanna show
My favourite location

One is a dove and
One is a woodlark
One is an owl and
One is a redstart

Sing to me now
A little bit louder
Into the night if
Anyone's out there

One for the stars
And one for the sailors,
One for the broken heart
And the failure

When the sky is a little too fed up with rain
Can I get on your little wings and fly away?

Come on sing to me now bird..

(merci Ã  coraline pour cettes paroles)
