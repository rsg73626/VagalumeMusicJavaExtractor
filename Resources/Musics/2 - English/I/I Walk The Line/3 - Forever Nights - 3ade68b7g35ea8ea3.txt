FOREVER NIGHTS

Let me make it clear,
I won't do this for you.
I will stand my ground, I have paid my dues.
Put on a new face, start bleeding new blood.
Crank a new sound, the paint is peeling.

Just forget the past, it's not holy water.
Drink the bitter tears,
wipe the dust off your shoulders.

It's a new road, craving for the unseen.
Feel my heart beat first time in years.
Just one more drink, a step up the ladder.
This eternity, make it go faster.

Rise above the trials and tribulations.
I'm tired of waiting a miracle to happen.

Turn the page. Climb up a mountain.
You don't know if you'd win,
if you don't run the race.
Turn the page. My heart is pounding.
Maybe tomorrow brings an occasional light
in these forever nights.

We're keeping warm around the oil barrel.
It's twilight, worries buried in fire.
All of these days go up in a smoke.
Moments of bliss like a ressurection.

Turn the page. Climb up a mountain.
You don't know if you'd win,
if you don't run the race.
Turn the page. My heart is pounding.
Maybe tomorrow brings an occasional light
in these forever nights.
