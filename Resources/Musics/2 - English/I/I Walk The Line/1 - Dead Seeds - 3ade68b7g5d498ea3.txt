DEAD SEEDS

We want change,
but we lack the courage.
Just go on with our daily routines.
The only thing we still have in common,
it is our history.
We're just running in circles,
banging our heads against the same wall.
All the voices turn into silence, but no,
I can't stop screaming

Sometimes it's better just to let go
than to hold on.
You have the choice to walk away.

Silence is killing us,
can't grow a thing with dead seeds.
Standing at the crossroads
watching our lives pass us by once again.

We're lost in death's garden
and keep on watering dead seeds.
The ground is still fertile,
but silence, the silence kills it.
You'll learn to respect freedom,
only when your hands are tied.
And time makes the knots even tighter.
It is harder to break free.

Sometimes it's better just to let go
than to hold on.
You have the choice to walk away.

Silence is killing us,
can't grow a thing with dead seeds.
Standing at the crossroads
watching our lives pass us by once again.

Why do we talk just for conversation?
How can we bond without connection?
What's dead and gone,
can't bring it to life now.
You won't know you lost something,
until it's gone.

Silence poisons our blood,
silence poisons our hearts once again.
