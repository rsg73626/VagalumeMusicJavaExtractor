WHERE STRANGERS MEET

I wanted to go outside the fence.
Follow my instincts, not common sense.
And I found an adventure that never ends.
There's people who walk on their own two feet.
They're not afraid to admit defeat.
But out there, it can be cold and desolate.

There's a light beyond dark ages.
There's a life outside the fences.
The chameleons, don't let them fool you tonight.
There ain't no truth in their eyes.

The chameleons couldn't get me to join
the parade of immortality,
cause I saw it is the parade of death.
I turned my head and walked away,
now I'm alone in a foreign place.
But I hear the walls echo my name.

I didn't choose it, it chose me.
I let my heart go and guide me.
And tonight I'll walk
where the strangers meet, desolation street.
The pavement on desolation street
is cracked like the sole of my feet,
for roaming around for my destiny,
desolation street.
