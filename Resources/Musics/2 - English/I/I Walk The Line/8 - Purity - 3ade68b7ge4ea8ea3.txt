PURITY

No Stations receiving my s.o.s.
The signal's buried in this concrete graveyard.
Antennas and radars sending beams
to our brain cells so receptive,
yet so fragile.

Manufactured replicants.
They haunt and surround us,
but I don't have an operator's manual.

Like vampires in bloodlust.
No lust for life,
just lust to own a piece of your heart.
It's harder to pick out the ones
that haven't been infected
with the poison beam.

The infected replicants.
They haunt and surround us,
but when I saw you there was no doubt.

Even if you sucked me dry, I know I wouldn't die.
I can feel you're purified.
When I look at you in the eye,
there's a bond we can't deny.
It won't vanish as time goes by.

It's a bloodbond.

The purity is exceptional.
