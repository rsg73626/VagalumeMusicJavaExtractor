WORLD ON A PYRE

I saw her pass me by, but she didn't cast a shadow
Did I miss something or am I getting paranoid?
This sure looks like a funeral, a neverending feast.
The pyre is getting bigger in front of me.

She's in a trance amongst them.
Unaware of being helpless
upon the coming of the vultures.
But you can feel it in the air.
The end is coming near.

They keep devouring on and on
until there's nothing left.
They'll end up starving
with their pride of being invincible.

Spontaneous behaviour's all been synchronized.
We're being fed by the hand of fear.
We are content with the state of our decline.
We're just drops in a sea of oblivion.

After the smoke is clearing,
will we be left with nothing?
Will there be a phoenix rising
from the ashes now?
I guess it's up to you.

They keep devouring on and on
until there's nothing left.
They'll end up starving
with their pride of being invincible.
