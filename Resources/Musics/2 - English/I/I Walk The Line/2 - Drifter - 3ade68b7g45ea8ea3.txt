DRIFTER

Spent my whole life drifting,
trusting my life on the hands of fate.
The winds take me to a harbor every now and then.
But how long can I go on like this?
Without setting my anchors, drifting away.

I'm swimming in darkness,
looking for a single ray of light.
The weights in my ankles are pulling me down,
Is it time to say goodbye?
Won't I still get one last chance?
Or is it time for the last goodbye?

Wasting away, drifting away.

Can I go on without setting my anchors?
Inside my heart I blocked all the answers.
I need them now. Where's the last lifeline?

I thought I had it, but now the story has an open end.
All ties that bind me with this world,
I lost them along the way.
Hatred and despair no longer sustain.
No anchors, no rudder, wasting away.

Wasting away, drifting away.
Can I go on without setting my anchors?
Inside my heart I blocked all the answers.
I need them now.

Where's the last lifeline?
