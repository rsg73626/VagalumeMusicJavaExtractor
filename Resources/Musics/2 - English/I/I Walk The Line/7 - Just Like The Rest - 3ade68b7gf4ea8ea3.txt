JUST LIKE THE REST

I'm on the roof of an office building,
on a railing of a bridge. Not even a razorblade
made me feel or sense anything.
I don't belong in this body,
I don't belong in this life.
Don't wanna wake up to the cold morning and
take another beating.

I just wanna be loved, like everybody does.
Without feeling guilty and ashamed.
I just wanna get drunk, like everybody does.
Without feeling like a loaded gun.

I'm the creep in the corner,
I'm the stain on your shirt.
I guess I would be better off dead
than on your way.
I wanna jump in front of the freight train,
or maybe just get on it.
Ride on to the new day dawning
and would never be found.

I just wanna be loved, like everybody does.
Without feeling guilty and ashamed.
I just wanna get drunk, like everybody does.
Without feeling like a loaded gun.

I don't wanna see the day I turn seventeen.
Why couldn't I be just like the rest?
I can never be free,
I'm trapped inside of me.
Please put me out of my misery.
