HOLLOW

Is this really my place in the world?
The waking hours I dream
and search for something more around me.
I cannot hide the broken face
that once veiled the broken mind.
But we all lie so well, it's alright.

Do you hate the strenght to follow
that fading star?
Like a guiding light it shined so bright.
Now everything turns hollow and insecure,
the foundation's about to break,
when your star is fading.

I thought it was buried six feet deep,
but now the soil is shaking.
It is time to ressurect.
A hand emerges, grabs by your throat,
drags you down to dig the dirt.
To battle with your fears and demons.

Do you hate the strenght to follow
that fading star?
Like a guiding light it shined so bright.
Now everything turns hollow and insecure,
the foundation's about to break,
when your star is fading.

What's left when the foundations break?
Will I land on a clean slate?
What's real when the truth got
twisted in my head?
Was I blind or just misled?
