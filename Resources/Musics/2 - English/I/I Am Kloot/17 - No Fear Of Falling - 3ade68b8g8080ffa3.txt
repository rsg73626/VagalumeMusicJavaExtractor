NO FEAR OF FALLING

Through my sleepless days I've found,
That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound, 
To one night here the sound, of you calling, 
Do not stumble through tonight, 
Have no fear of falling.

And if nobody got lost, 
And if no-one paid the cost, 
The price of this you may summise, is forever after, 
You won't stumble through tonight drowning in their laughter.
You won't stumble through tonight drowning in their laughter.

From these moments, we awake, 
Our heads clear of the mistakes, 
How we never hit the breaks, or felt it stalling, 
Just don't stumble through tonight, 
Have no fear of falling. 
No don't stumble through tonight.
