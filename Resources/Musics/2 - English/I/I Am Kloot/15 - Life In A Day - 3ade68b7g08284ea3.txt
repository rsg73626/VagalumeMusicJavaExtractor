LIFE IN A DAY

Life in a day
Fleet of foot
Full of grace
Love, mercy miles
Freedom fortune, such a filthy child

Life in a day
Life in a day

Stick your jokes, your hoax in a box
Chew the chains, loose the locks
Lease your mind and find a better rate
If freedom feels like a first mistake

Life in a day
Life in a day

Life in a day
See you hoof and move your feet of clay
Let it go you know, or let it break
Freedom feels like a first mistake

Life in a day
Life in a day
