THE SAME DEEP WATER AS ME

Swim out to the ocean
Drown your thought out at sea
And dip your hands in the water
The same deep water as me

You've been watching for cloudbursts
You've been praying for rain
Drench your soul in the water
Cleanse your heart of the stain
Cleanse your heart of the stain

The river of love
Flows deep through the night
Rolls you in with the waves
Drags you out with the tides

Swim out to the ocean
And drown our thoughts out at sea
And dipped your hands in the water
The same deep water as me
The same deep water as me
