CUCKOO

You stand like a rock, on top of the mountain 
Run like a river, fall like a fountain 
The grass still is growing, the wind still is blowing, about you 

Reels like a strain, drinks like a scholar 
Drown in this town, you can feel for one dollar 
Since when were you bitten, where were you smitten

Looks like a date, but seems like your brother 
Seems like your father, your sister, your mother 
Threw out in chains, wildhood and childhood, cuckoo 

Drinks like a rogue, looks like no other 
Looks like a dream, one youâ€™ll discover 
Seems like its bitten, whence were you smitten, cuckoo

Looks like a saint, drinks like a scholar 
Dreams in this town you can buy for one dollar 
Whence were you smitten, where were you bitten, cuckoo 

Wrench like a chain(?), looks like no other 
Your father, your mother, your sister, your brother 
Have all since long gone, all since long gone
