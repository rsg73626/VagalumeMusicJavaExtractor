A STRANGE ARRANGEMENT OF COLOUR

A strange arrangement of colours,
you found your feet where you put 'em,

Im after you and your after me,
the things that we say the things that we see,

Chorus- 
Where did you go,
What did you see,
When you were there,
What did you leave,

The light that is reflected,
the times you were rejected,

You're after me and im after you,
the things that we say, the things that we see,
you've got to be good looking,

Chorus

a lie that is rejected,
a time that we reflected,

Im after you and you're after me,
that things that we say, the things that we see,
we've got to be reminded,

chorus
