TO YOU

The gods and the saints preserve you,
'cause nobody here deserves you.
I'm living my life in flashback,
Since I lost my card for cashback.
and I've gone to rack and ruin,
Since I don't know what you're doing.
There's no clear or present danger,
That I see in any stranger.

Someone, somewhere, said to me.
Will someone, somewhere, set me free.
Well hurry up or, harry me.
Will someone, somewhere, marry me.
To you, To you, To you, To you.

The line on the screen has broken,
What once was asleep has woken.
I cover your face in make up,
Praying you'll one day wake up.
I've littered at life with magic,
Yet I'm neither dead 'nor tragic.
The gods and the saints preserve you,
'cause nobody here deserves you.

Someone, somewhere, said to me.
Will someone, somewhere, set me free.
From all that I'm supposed to be,
Will someone, somewhere, marry me.
To you, To you, To you


Someone, somewhere, said to me.
Will someone, somewhere, marry me.
Well hurry up or, harry me.
Will someone, somewhere, marry me.
To you, To you, To you, To you.
