BIG TEARS

How long have you worn that dress
The colours shows all the mess
But they dont want that kind of thing round here
You've been trying too hard it's clear
You've been dieing to dry those big tears.

You've got a head full of library books
Your mother had all the looks
But they dont want that kind of thing round here
You've been trying too hard it's clear
You've been dieing to dry those big tears.

Do you know what they all think about you.
Do you know how they cant live without you.

You've got a head full of common sense
But thats not much recompence
Cuz I dont want that kind of thing round here
I've been trying too hard it's clear
Now we're dieing to dry those big tears.

How long have I worn this shirt
The colours shows all the dirt
They dont want that kind of thing round here
I've been trying too hard it's clear
