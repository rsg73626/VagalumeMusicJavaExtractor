MONKEYS

You can take a million of the monkeys
Put 'em through a hoop
You can make a packet from the rackets
And boil down for soup

I can hear the sound of music
Lingering taste of the jewellery
You're the walk on ghost
You're a living host (argh)
All of they want you to be.

You can take a million of the monkeys
Put 'em through a hoop
You can make a packet from the rackets
And boil down for soup

I can hear the sound of make up
Lingering stench of the jewellery
You're the walk on ghost
You're a living host (argh)
All of they want you to be.

I can hear the sound of music
Lingering taste of the jewellery
You're the walk on ghost
You're a living host (argh)
All of they want you to be.
Walk on ghost, Living host
Walk on ghost, Living host
Living ghost, Walk on host
