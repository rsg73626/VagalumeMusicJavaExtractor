AVENUE OF HOPE

Along the avenue of hope 
The footsteps falter, the fingers grope 
and days, stretch out, beneath the sun 
No-one's born, and no-one dies, no-one lives, so no-one cries 
and we wait to see just what we will become 

Don't let me falter, don't let me ride 
Don't let the earth in me subside 
Let me see just who I will become 

You're like the clouds in my home town 
You just grow fat and hang around 
and you're days stretch out beneath the sun 

and you don't live, you don't die, you don't love so you don't cry 
and we wait, to see just what we will become 

Don't let me borrow, don't let me bring 
Don't let me wallow, don't make me sing 
Let me see just who I will becomee 

Don't let me falter, don't let me hide 
Don't let someone else decide 
Just who or what I will become 

Don't let them borrow, don't let them bring 
Don't let them wallow, don't make them sing 
Let them stretch out beneath the sun
