STOP TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS

Stop taking photographs, your brittle heart'll never bleed
Took your big head to succeed, it hasn't been a million laughs
So stop taking polaroids, of all the things that you avoid
There are no lessons in your path, so stop taking photographs

The naked lights revealed you, shattered and then sealed you in your dreams
and this loneliness has stripped you, unbuttoned and unzipped you til ya fell
apart at the seems

Stop taking photographs, your brittle heart'll never bleed
It took your big head to succeed, it hasn't been a million laughs
So stop taking polaroids, of all the things that you avoid
There are no lessons in your path, so stop taking photographs

and the naked lights revealed you, shattered and then sealed you in your dreams
and this loneliness has stripped you, unbuttoned and unzipped you til ya fell
apart at the seems

So stop taking photographs, your brittle heart'll never bleed
