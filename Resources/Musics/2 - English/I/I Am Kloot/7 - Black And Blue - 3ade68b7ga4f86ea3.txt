BLACK AND BLUE

Lights are shining all around this world
You want them all but what you want is this girl
You can stick those rules, they're just second best
They give you so much but you land up with less
They give you money when what you need is love
It makes you smile pretending it's all enough

See the world now it's bruised black and blue
You want it all but all I want is you
So give up the chance to be true

Dream for tomorrow, live for today
Someone, somewhere may just throw it away
It's been to the bottom, turned to the top
Lift up your eyes as if you were nearer to god
So get your bicycle and go earn your keep, there'll be
Nine million cycles here by this time next week

See the world now it's bruised black and blue
You want it all but all I want is you
So give up the chance to be true
We all wind up like we knew we'd do
Bruised black and blue

So many words are hard but true
We all wind up like we knew we'd do
Bruised black and blue
Bruised black and blue
