PROOF

Hey, could you stand another drink
I'm better when I don't think
It seems to get me through
Well, d'you wanna spin another line
Like we had a good time
Not that I need proof

Swell, we're living in a hotel
And someones ringing my bell
In a room without a view
Hey, heard you read another book
Should i take another look
Who am I
Without you
