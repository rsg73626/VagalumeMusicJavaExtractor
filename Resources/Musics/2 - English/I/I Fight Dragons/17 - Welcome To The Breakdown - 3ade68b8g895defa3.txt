WELCOME TO THE BREAKDOWN

It's not enough
it never is

I tell myself
Ican't take this
Tomorrow comes,i'm back in
Playin dumb and waiting for
Something i could never find
To come knock,knock,knocking down my door
But waitings such a waste
Of time so
Here we go!
(chorus)
Break me downAnd build me up again
I can take it
The remaking
The more we know
The less we understand
So live the rebound
Welcome to the breakdown!!!

Forget the day
Forget the cloock
Forget yoursewlf
And don't stop
Cuz soon enough
You find out
The only truth
Is the breaking down
And everybody does sometimes
You're lie lie
Lying ont the floor
Life is in the way you
Learn from it
Lose or win
(chorus2x)

Break me downAnd build me up again
I can take it
The remaking
The more we know
The less we understand
So live the rebound
Welcome to the breakdown!!!

Break me downAnd build me up again
I can take it
The remaking
The more we know
The less we understand
So live the rebound
Welcome to the breakdown!!!
Welcome to the breakdown!!!
Welcome to the breakdown!!!
So get the rebound
Welcome to the breakdown
