I WILL WAIT FOR YOU IF YOU DO FOR ME

In the pouring rain
In the desert heat
Far across the sea
I will wait for you if you do for me

With the city lights
Upon your cheek
Will you clearly see?
I will wait for you if you do for me

And though time will move so slow
You and I will still be fine
As long as we know

Though the nights grow long
Though the days grow bleak
When our hearts are free
Well, I will wait for you if you do for me

Well, I will wait for you if you do for me

And though time will move so slow
You and I will still be fine
As long as we know

In the pouring rain
In the desert heat
Far across the sea
Well, I will wait for you if you do for me
I will wait for you if you do for me
