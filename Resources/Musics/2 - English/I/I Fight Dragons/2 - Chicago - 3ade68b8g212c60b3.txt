CHICAGO

Ooh chicago knows how small we are
How bright she shines in the dark
Ooh and though I go
She's in my heart
Chicago holds me when I fall apart
When you sit on the train
And you're hit by the way that the city lights around you
Late in night when you ride do you look outside
Do you see the bright light that I do?
All the people, the places, the city faces they won't take me in
All around, all the lost, all the found, all the everything in every instant

Ooh chicago knows how small we are
How bright she shines in the dark
Ooh and though I go
She's in my heart
Chicago holds me when I fall apart
Why so we try to be everything everybody tells us that we should be?
Why do I try to hide in the city lights with people all around me?
Well chicago you know I could never be the one that change it all
As I walk down the street I can feel, I can eat, I can fade into your walls

Ooh chicago knows how small we are
How bright she shines in the dark
Ooh and though I go
She's in my heart
Chicago holds me when I fall apart
I know tomorrow is always in my heart
I guess I gotta give it time

Ooh chicago knows how small we are
How bright she shines in the dark
Ooh and though I go
She's in my heart
Chicago holds me when I fall
Ooh chicago knows how small we are
How bright she shines in the dark
Ooh and though I go
She's in my heart
Chicago holds me when I fall apart
