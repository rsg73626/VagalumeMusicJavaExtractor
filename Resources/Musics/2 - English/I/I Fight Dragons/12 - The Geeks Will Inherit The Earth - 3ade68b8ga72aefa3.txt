THE GEEKS WILL INHERIT THE EARTH

I remember trying to talk to you in high school
Couldn't even get a look cause you were too cool
But now we're older and we're playing by the new rules
We lived and learned cause as time moves on
We find we belong and then in the end

Chorus
We were the ones you used to make fun of
We stayed at home alone instead of falling in love
We never got the chance to be prom king
We didn't even dance but here's the thing
We got the cars
We got the money
We need some sun but I'm telling you honey
That the geeks will the geeks will
The geeks will inherit the Earth

Everybody tries to tell you that you're different
So you run away and wonder if it makes sense
But the day will come when you will get a new chance
The tables turn
And you know you'll be much more than they see
Inside you'll find

Chorus
We were the ones you used to make fun of
We stayed at home alone instead of falling in love
We never got the chance to be prom king
We didn't even dance but here's the thing
We got the cars
We got the money
We need some sun but I'm telling you honey
That the geeks will the geeks will
The geeks will inherit the Earth
The geeks will inherit the Earth
The geeks will inherit the Earth

Chorus
We were the ones you used to make fun of
We stay home alone instead of falling in love
We never got the chance to get drunk
We didn't even dance cause we used to think
Cause we got the cars we got the money
We make some sun but I am telling you honey
That the geeks the geeks will
The geeks will inherit the Earth
The geeks will inherit the Earth
The geeks will inherit the Earth
