THE NEAR FUTURE II. EIGHTEEN

Eighteen at a traffic light
I've got nowhere to be on a friday night
I've got it all
I got nothing

Summer's here and I'm finally free
I've got no one to do and no one to see
I've got it all
I got nothing

Eighteen is a funny age
You've got so many dreams
And an empty page
I've got it all
Cause I've got nothing

Everybody knows what I should do
Everybody works so I should too
How do I explain what feels so wrong
Dealing with the shame of knowing you don't belong

So you try and smile and hope you won't always be
Alone with the dreams
Living in between
Eighteen

Eighteen and I feel so old
Like a bright screen with the paper sold
Seen it all
I've seen nothing

Eighteen with the carded drives
And a strange need just to feel alive
I see it all
I see nothing

Well have you heard
It's a golden age
Go get your golden view from your golden cage
I seen it all
Because Ive seen nothing

Everybody knowns what I should do
Everybody works so I should too
How do I explain what feels so wrong
Dealing with the shame of knowing you don't belong

So you try and smile and hope
That you won't always be
Alone with your dreams
Living in between

Everybody does just what their told
Everybody buys just what their sold
How do I escape what I can't see
How do I replace the broken parts of me

No, you try and smile and hope
That you won't always be
Alone with your dreams
Living in between
Eighteen
