THE NEAR FUTURE X. FIGHTING ON

I've never been the one to win it all
To be the champion
I always get in my own way

But I get up again each time I fall
I keep on going
I guess that's all there is to me

Maybe they were right, maybe I was wrong
But I put up a fight, and
I feel like I'm right where I belong
Cause if you're next to me
That's all I really need

We'll keep fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
We'll keep fighting on
Long after the rest have wept and gone
We'll be fighting on, we'll keep fighting on

Every morning I remind myself
I don't know all the answers
I gotta learn that that's ok

I'm slowly turning into someone else
As I get older
Someone who I'd rather be

Maybe they were right, maybe I was wrong
But I put up a fight, and
I feel like I'm right where I belong
Cause if you're next to me
That's all I really need

We'll keep fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
We'll keep fighting on
Long after the rest have wept and gone
We'll be fighting on, we'll keep fighting on

Maybe they were right, maybe I was wrong
But I put up a fight, and
I feel like I'm right where I belong
Cause if you're next to me
That's all I really need

We'll keep fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
We'll keep fighting on
Long after the rest have wept and gone
We'll be fighting on, we'll keep fighting on

We'll keep fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
We'll keep fighting on
Long after the rest have wept and gone
We'll be fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
We'll keep fighting on

We'll keep fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
Long after the rest have wept and gone
We'll be fighting on, we'll keep fighting on
We'll keep fighting on
