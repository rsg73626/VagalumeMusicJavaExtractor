MONEY

Green is where it's at
Green will never let you down
You can bet your life on that
Win the bet and buy a crown
'Cause when pushin' comes to shove
Money conquers faith and love
You can buy 'em up for nothing down

Money makes the world go round and round
Round and around
Money makes the world go round and round
Round and around

Sell your soul at cost
Buy the bar another round
Make yourself the boss
Pay your worker's shit and tax the ground
'Cause when money is your friend
Then the party never ends
Hire a crew and you can paint the town

Money makes the world go round and round
Round and around
Money makes the world go round and round
Round and around

Money makes the world go round and round
Round and around
Money makes the world go round and round
Round and around
