THE NEAR FUTURE IV. ANOTHER WEEK

In the window I could swear I've seen her
Was it real though? She's a disappearer
So much I don't know
That gets clearer every day

So I'm stuck here with the memory of her
And a vague fear of what I've uncovered
Don't wanna stay here
Not if there's some other way

Another week goes by
The summer drags on
Turns out that time won't fly
When you're trying to move on
And in the blink of an eye you see her face
Then she's gone and run away
Why can't you find her?
Another day
Another reminder of your place

Was I dreaming? Did it really happen?
Could the whole thing be my imagination?
I can't stop seeing her reflection everywhere

So once again I'm in the same position
In between the lines, a soldier with no mission
Trapped inside my mind
Chronic condition of the scared

Another week goes by
The summer drags on
Turns out that time won't fly
When you're trying to move on
And in the blink of an eye you see her face
Then she's gone and run away
Why can't you find her?
Another day
Another reminder of your place

To be honest
I don't want to move on
Get beyond this
When I'd rather get gone
Gone from all this
Off to see who I'll become

Another week goes by
The summer drags on
Turns out that time won't fly
No matter how hard
How hard
How hard you try

The week goes by
The summer drags on
Turns out that time won't fly
When you're trying to move on
And in the blink of an eye you see her face
Then she's gone and run away
Why can't you find her?
Another day
Another reminder of your place
