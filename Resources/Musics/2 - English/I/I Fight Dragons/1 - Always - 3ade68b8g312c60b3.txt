ALWAYS

Tonight you look like a dream
Then again you always do to me
After everything we've been through
I still just love to look at you
I can't promise you there won't be pain
I can't promise to remain the same
But when you're scared I'll be there, tonight and always

One day we'll travel the globe
Adventure calls us and we'll go
Even if we don't that's ok
Long as I'm with you that's where I'll stay
I can't promise you there won't be pain
I can't promise to remain the same
But when you're scared I'll be there, tonight and always

I can't promise you there won't be pain
I can't promise to remain the same
But when you're scared I'll be there, tonight and always
When you're scared I'll be there, tonight and always
