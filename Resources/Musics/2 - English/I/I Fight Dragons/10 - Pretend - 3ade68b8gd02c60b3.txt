PRETEND

They came at night
No one was watching
And they travel light
Before we knew
They'd taken over
And now they've come for you

One, two
(They're in your room)
Three, four
(They're at the store)
Five, six
(They got the kids)
Nine, ten
(They got your friends)

No one noticed when the world began to change
'Til one by one we started going down in flames
Now I don't want to be the one who doesn't live to see the end
So I just smile and pretend
Call them your friends
Call them your saviors
Or your presidents

Call it the truth, but
Spare me your sermons
Until they turn on you
One, two
(They're on the news)
Three, four
(They're at your door)
Five, six
(They know your tricks)
Nine, ten
(They know your plans)

No one noticed when the world began to change
'Til one by one we started going down in flames
Now I don't want to be the one who doesn't live to see the end
So I just smile and pretend
One, two
(They run the schools)
Three, four
(They change the score)

Five, six
(They got the rich)
Nine, ten
(They always win)
No one noticed when the world began to change
'Til one by one we started going down in flames
Now I don't want to be the one who doesn't live to see the end
So I just smile and pretend
