NO ONE LIKES SUPERMAN ANYMORE

Strong hands, strong mind
Strong all the time
Straightforward and kind
Too simply defined

'Cause no one wants to know the man who stands for things we outgrow
He's too noble and too blind
We're all older now and we don't need someone to care 'bout
The innocence we left behind

(Don't touch that dial)
(It's just that goodness is out of style)

Be dark, be cold (so conflicted)
No hand to hold (heart constricted)
Dark Knight, bright soul (we're addicted)
No room here for the bold

'Cause no one wants to know the man who stands for things we outgrow
He's too noble and too blind
We're all older now and we don't need someone to care 'bout
The innocence we left behind

And what if he can fly?
Hey, well so can I
Jet Blue or United Airlines
And who cares if he's strong
All we see's the wrong we've done
Reflected in his eyes

'Cause no one wants to know the man who stands for things we outgrow
He's too noble and too blind
We're all older now and we
don't need someone to care 'bout
The innocence we left behind 

('Cause no one wants to know the man who stands for things we outgrow
He's too noble and too blind)
