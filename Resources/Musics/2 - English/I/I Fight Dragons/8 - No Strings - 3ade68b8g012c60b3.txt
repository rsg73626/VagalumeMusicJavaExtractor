NO STRINGS

I used to hate myself
When I would let you down
I thought it was my fault
But I know better now
You didn't want
Me as I was
You wanted someone
Who would live for your applause

You're free to do what
You want to do but I don't have to
I used to care what
You thought of me but now I see through
You and your brass rings
Cuz I don't dance and I've got no strings
I used to think that
You knew all the answers cold
But then I blinked
And saw the shit beneath the gold

Now that I know
I can let go
I can be anyone
I want when I'm alone
You're free to do what
You want to do but I don't have to
I used to care what
You thought of me but now I see through
You and your brass rings
Cuz I don't dance and I've got no strings

You're free to do what
You want to do but I don't have to
I used to care what
You thought of me but now I see through
You're free to do what
You want to do but I don't have to
I used to care what
You thought of me but now I see through

You're free to do what
You want to do but I don't have to
I used to care what
You thought of me but now I see through
You and your brass rings
Cuz I don't dance and I've got no strings
