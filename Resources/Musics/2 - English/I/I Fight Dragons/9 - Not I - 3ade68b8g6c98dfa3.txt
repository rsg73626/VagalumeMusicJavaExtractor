NOT I

Everything you plant will die	
The seasons all will pass you by
All your plans will go awry
So, who's afraid to live?
Not i.
	
Everyone you know will lie	
Those you trust will make you cry
All hellos end with goodbye
So, who's afraid to love?
Not i.
	
Chorus:	
And i'll let this go
Keep it to myself
If no one knows, i'll be fine
But even so, it's hard to walk that line
	
Liars look you in the eye	
You will fall before you fly
And no one here can tell you why
So, who's afraid to laugh?
Not i.
	
Chorus	
	
'cuz everything you plant will die	
Those you trust will make you cry
And no one here can tell you why
So, who's afraid to live?
Not i.
	
So, who's afraid to live?	
Not i.
So, who's afraid to live?
Not i.
