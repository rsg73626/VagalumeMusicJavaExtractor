HEADS UP, HEARTS DOWN

Take a number, dear
Wait your turn, and don't get out of line
Everything you fear Paint it black
In the back of your mind
Just go on breathing
Repeating,

Heads up, hearts down
Steady as she goes
Don't break step
Don't make a sound
Heads up, hearts down
No one ever knows
What started this exodus
Onward bound

Your composure slips
Twenty-two and nothing left to do
But resign to this
Bonafide Pilgrim Pride, tried and true so you
Don't question
This lesson

Heads up, hearts down
Steady as she goes
Don't break step
Don't make a sound
Heads up, hearts down
No one ever knows
What started this exodus
Onward bound

I try to find my strength inside the sound
But I can't fight the darkness all around
I'm bleeding 'til I drown

Heads up, hearts down
Steady as she goes
Don't break step
Don't make a sound
Heads up, hearts down
No one ever knows
What started this exodus
Onward bound
