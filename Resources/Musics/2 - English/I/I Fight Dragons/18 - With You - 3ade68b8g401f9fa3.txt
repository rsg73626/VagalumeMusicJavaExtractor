WITH YOU

You say, "Look outside
Rain is pouring down
Let's stay and hide."

I say, "What the hell
We've got things to do
But we might as well
Stay and rebel."

Maybe we will be everything we say
Maybe all that we dream will fade to gray
Either way, I will stay
With you

They say, "Pay your bills
Earn your daily bread
Take all your pills."

We say, "Look around
At the heart of things
Share what you've found
Stand your ground."

Maybe we will be everything we say
Maybe all that we dream will fade to gray
Either way, I will stay
With you 

Maybe we will be everything we say
Maybe all that we dream will fade to gray
Either way, I will stay
With you
With you (with you)
With you... (you)
