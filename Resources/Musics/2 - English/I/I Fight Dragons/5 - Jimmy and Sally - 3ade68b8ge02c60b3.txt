JIMMY AND SALLY

Sally played guitar down in all the local bars
She dreamed of making it big
But sally never got that far
Sally writes songs that nobody hears
But somehow that's ok
All you need to know so far is sally played the guitar

Jimmy's got good grades now he works max on saturdays
He always followed the rules
But it turns out that doesn't pay
Jimmy doesn't know what he's gonna do
But he knows he can't go on this way
And thou he may not care very much
Jimmy got good grades

Will you try to remember or forget?
What if living just hasn't happen yet
You can wait till forever for a sign
What if living is just a state of mind?
Well I don't wanna be left behind
In the limelight sally takes the stage
And she lets the whole world know
She fights her own fights

She's not the kind of girl that's afraid to be alone
Cause sally when she plays she plays
And no one else is on the stage
Jimmy hides out at the top of the stairs in his room at night
He has adventures when there's nobody there he reads by candlelight
And when the sun begin to rise jimmy breakes and rubs his eyes
Will you try to remember or forget?
What if living just hasn't happen yet
You can wait till forever for a sign
What if living is just a state of mind?
Well I don't wanna be left behind

Sally leads the way
Sally saves the day
Sally goes down swinging
Jimmy plans and schemes
Jimmy hopes and dreams
Jimmy looks before leaping
Sally and jimmy don't know
But one day they gonna make each other home

They're always learning the hard way
Build it and brake it down
Burn it and then start again
But they're gonna learn someday, I bet
Will you try to remember or forget?
What if living just hasn't happen yet
You can wait till forever for a sign
But what if living is just a state of mind?

Will I try to remember or forget?
What if living just hasn't happen yet
I can wait till forever for a sign
It turns that living is just a state of mind
And I don't wanna be left
I'm not gonna be left
Jimmy and sally will find a finale
As people in pieces of my personality
No one, no one is gonna be left behind
