THE FASTER THE TREADMILL

Sun goes down, sun comes up
Days can drown in a plastic cup
In this town
In this town

Don't know how, don't know when
Something came but it left again
And I'm down
On this town

'Cause no matter what I see
People love to disagree

Every time I say what I want to be
Someone says that's not how it's going to be
Come on, baby, quit your dreaming
Grab your things, the train is leaving

Time to pick that somewhere you want to go
Get there quick or drown in the undertow
Come on baby, time is wasting
Choose a wheel and get to racing

Sun goes up and down again
Hard to stop feeling broken in
And worn down
By this town

All the same
You find me here
Placing blame and escaping fear and self-doubt
And this town

But no matter where I go
People love to tell me, "No"

Every time I say what I want to be
Someone says that's not how it's going to be
Come on, baby, quit your dreaming
Grab your things, the train is leaving

Time to pick that somewhere you want to go
Get there quick or drown in the undertow
Come on, baby, time is wasting
Choose a wheel and get to racing

Every time I say what I want to be
Someone says that's not how it's going to be
Come on baby, quit your dreaming
Grab your things, the train is leaving

And if you feel like nobody understands
You just smile and pray that they clap their hands
Come on, baby, drown your sorrow
Work today and live tomorrow

Time to pick that somewhere you want to go
Get there quick or drown in the undertow
Come on baby, time is wasting
Choose a wheel and get to racing
