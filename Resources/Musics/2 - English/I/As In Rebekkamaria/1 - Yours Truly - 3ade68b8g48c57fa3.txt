YOURS TRULY

I scratch your face
And you scrub my back
I turn you down
And you turn me on
You break all the windows
And I am the wind
I leave all the lights on
And you do the dishes

Your name
Yours truly
Do it again
Do it slowly
Our game
Yours truly
Play it again
Play it over

I rub your back
And you tuck me in
I am a fool
And you play it cool
You wait in the alley
And I walk alone
I leave here a stranger
And you call my name

Your name
Yours truly
Do it again
Do it slowly
Our game
Yours truly
Play it again
Play it over

You are all 
You are all
You are all I`m waiting for
