I GIVE UP

If I say good by it´s supposed
And if you see me cry
Please don´t turn around it´s better
I love and it´s true I wanna make you understand
That I must let you go
´cos this love´s close to the end
I know I fought for you
That´s the reason we´re still here
But a bird which longs for freedon
For sure must be released
I can see in your eyes
You can stay by my side
But your feelings ain´t just like mine
All the things that I´ve done
To make you my number one
Haven´t been enough so I give up

Had dreams about us
I believed our love could last
You could be so far away
But You´ve always been in my heart
Thought the distance was the evil
But it was not now I know
Tough I taken for my love
You don´t love at all

I know I fought for you
That´s the reason we´re still here
But the love that I gave you
Ain´t the same I was given
I can see in your eyes
You can stay by my side
But your feelings ain´t just like mine
All the things that I´ve done
To make you my number one
Haven´t been enough so I breakup
Any way one day you´d go away
And I would have to face the pain
