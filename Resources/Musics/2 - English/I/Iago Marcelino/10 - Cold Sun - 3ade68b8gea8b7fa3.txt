COLD SUN

I only feel cold in Summer
It ain´t hot under the sun
I really wanted to be your lover
We coud´ve had a lot of fun
Since you went away
A long long long time
Nothing seems to be the same
Sun´s completly lost its shine
Oh Its shine
maybe you´ll be back someday
And by looking your eyes
I´ll tell you how you made me fade away
The they you left me behind
Oh Left behind
You left me behind without my pride
You left me behind with my pain
You left me behind with you in my eyes
You left me behind with my shame
Riding under this cold sun
I sing an old and sad song
And wonder what I should have done
And wonder what I should have done
To make you see my love
