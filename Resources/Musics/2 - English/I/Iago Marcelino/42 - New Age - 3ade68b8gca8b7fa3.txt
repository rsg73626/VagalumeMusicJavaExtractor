NEW AGE

When everything seems to have changed
And you just break down
Your life is no longer the same
You got to know it somehow
Close your eyes look at yourself
Cry for the moon
Don´t be afraid 
But the new age is coming soon
Sparkling children walking around
Just passing us by
They know what to do they know what they want
they even can fly high
Close your eyes look at yourself
Cry for the moon
Don´t be afraid 
But the new age is coming soon
The chaotic life
Has no reason why
The world has changed
Your questions are miles and miles away
