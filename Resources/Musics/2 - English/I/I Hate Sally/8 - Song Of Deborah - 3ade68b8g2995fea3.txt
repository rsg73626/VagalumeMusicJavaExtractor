SONG OF DEBORAH

You can do something
Read between the lines
Strong, Painful, Honest
Nakedly candid
The story of desperate
On Drugs, on the run
The girl almost made it
Horrified
You can't ask Alice, questions no more
A smile and a dishrag
Questions no more
The story is awful
Divorced by a gun
The girl almost made it
The girl almost won
Los Angeles

She won love
Say it again
When you walk amongst the dead
Everybody knows
You can't talk about yourself
Everything shows
