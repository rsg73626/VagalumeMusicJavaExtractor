THE PLAGUE

This is the end
Killed by evil
Will we defend pre-made icons

Machine guns grind us down
The last gears turn and fade away
Machine guns grind us down
Our fatal course is set to burn

Mass destruction
Our devil laughs
No election break the union

Machine guns grind us down
The last gears turn and fade away
This fatal story you won't learn

You've got sick aspirations
Ignite the candle in the night
(ordered the last incisions)
This candid slaughter of delight
You kick the candle in the night
This black hour of delight

Erupt the fields
Kill the village
It's time to kneel
No one listening

Machine guns grind us down
The last gears turn and fade away
Machine guns grind us down
This automatic hand you yearn

Sad for goodbye
Candle of night was it tonight
Time for delight
Wake up you'll die
Time for you
War, live, for, die
War, die, war

Dead before
Lock down dead before you wake
Sick Sunday mistake
Lock down dead before you wake
Suddenly I hate
