EVE, BE DEAR TO HIM

Hey, there's blood in your veins
Shoot, now the blood on your face hunting for the hunter's chemical cure
Accident?
Borne intellect

Said you, said you, said you
Said you wanna live it up
Said you, said you, said you

End of game
Life, raised in a cell
Caged, from these streets of hell
Hunted, like the drug addicts before
Coincidence?
Borne Innocence

Grief, bullet belts will pour spilling in the streets
Lost all rights
Lock your door
Lost all rights
Get up or you're done
Just sit back, represent
Lost all rights
Represent
Lost all rights
Get lost or you're gone

Raise your stakes to guns
Playground, circles of fun
Hunt, the innocent down
Accident?
Borne intellect

Get your gun ready to go
Get up, get action
Get your gun ready to go
Sit up relax some
Get your gun ready
