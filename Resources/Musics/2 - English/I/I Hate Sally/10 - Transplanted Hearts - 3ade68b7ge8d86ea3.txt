TRANSPLANTED HEARTS

Brick heavy
Transplanted hearts
The factory pumps another
Electric chairs
Another cynics story
Pushed off in fear
It's just an oozing year
Burnt vacant stares
This guilt is filled with lies

One two three what the fuck
What do you work for
What do you live for
What do you work for
One two three don't stop just go

Genocide
Innocent (we kill, we kill, we kill)
Kill the poor
Raise the dead
Finger fuck disease
Till we're over bred

Force fed this life
Destroying all that is pure
Lets burn these ties
And start the whole thing over
Brutal disguise
Of freedom fighting heroes
Breakdown in time
This guilt is filled with lies
