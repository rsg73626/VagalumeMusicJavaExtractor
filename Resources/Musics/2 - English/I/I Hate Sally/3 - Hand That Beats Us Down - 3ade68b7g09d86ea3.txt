HAND THAT BEATS US DOWN

Sorrow bleeds lies
Handshake the fist of fury
Dissect a perfect theory
For justice piece of nation for justice
Land loss, too young to die
So liberal, too young to live
For nothing, too young to die
For living and now the laughter's gone

Step through the bodies the bleeding
Half eaten will feeds the forceful the forceful has been
Bitten by the hand that beats us down

Ironic view, distasteful lies
Nameless crosses slip into mass graves
Lame destruction
A flag erected burns

Torture, murder
Snapshots of the darkest hour
Of these awful lives we live
For fight it freedom a fucking nations bleeding
Torture, murder
Snapshots of the darkest minute
Tanks roll through the drive-thru
Feeding hunger beating women
Children dying fight for freedom
A fucking nations leaving
Torture, murder
Gunshots there's blood on walls
Of Shameless forego
This sickening pleasure to breed
Your urban crisis so free your guards let down

I can hear your screams
Sorrow bleeds these lies
I can hear the screams
Sorrow bleeds these lies
