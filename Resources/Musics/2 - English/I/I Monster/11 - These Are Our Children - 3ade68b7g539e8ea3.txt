THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN

Hide and seek is the game
We'll teach you how to play
Close your eyes, really tight
Make it dark, like the night

The party never ends, the game begins again (x4)

Climb the stairs to the top
Rooms are dark but don't stop
Getting close, really warm
Now you're in the floor

The party never ends, the game begins again (x8)
