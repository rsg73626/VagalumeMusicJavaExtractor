CELLS

Look at the cells
Watch them grow
Dividing so fast
How much do they know ?

[Refrão]
It's just a little piece of me and you
It's easy
Just a little piece of me and you
It's easy

DNA do not alter
Building your son or daughter

[Refrão]

Look at the cells
Taking form
Amphibian child
You have born

[Refrão]

Hands, heart, brain, eyes that will see
Infinite complexity
