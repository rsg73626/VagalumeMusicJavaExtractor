WHO IS SHE?

Oh who is she?
A misty memory?
A haunting face?
Is she a lost embrace?

Am I in love with just a theme?
Or is Ayesha just a dream?
A mystery.
Oh, who is she?

Oh who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face,
Is she a lost embrace?

I call her name
Across an endless plain
She'll answer me
wherever she may be

Oh who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face,
Is she a lost embrace?

Somewhere across the sea of time
A love immortal just like mine
Will come to me eternally

Immortal she
Return to me
