DAYDREAM IN BLUE

Daydream, I fell asleep amid the flowers
for a couple of hours on a beautiful day

Daydream, I dreamed of you amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, such a beautiful day!

I dreamed of the places I've been with you
how we sat with the stream flowing by

And then when I kissed you and held you so near tell me why, tell me why you're so shy?

Daydream, I fell asleep amid the flowers
for a couple of hours on a beautiful day

Daydream, come share a dream amid the flowers for a couple of hours on a beautiful day

I dreamed of the places I've been with you
how we sat with the stream flowing by

And then when I kissed you and held you so near
tell me why, tell me why you're so shy?

Daydream, I sing with you amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, singing all of the day

Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na

Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
Na na na na na na na, na
Na na na na na, na
