EVERYONE'S A LOSER

Laughing we swim, down the river
Floating we live, bound together

[Refrão]
And everyone's a loser baby that's true
Everyone's a loser baby that's true
Me and you

Walk fast the road, long and winding
Breaking the code, the future's hiding

[Refrão]

Trying to fly, away from the shadows
High as a kite, and over the rainbow

[Refrão]
