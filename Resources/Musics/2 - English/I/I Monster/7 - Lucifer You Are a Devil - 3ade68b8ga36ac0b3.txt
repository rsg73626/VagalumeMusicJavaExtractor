LUCIFER YOU ARE A DEVIL

They call you the Goat of Mendes
Splendid beard and horns
Clothes hand-stitched by virgins
Sacrificed at dawn

Lucifer, you're a devil
Satan what's your game
Beelzebub where are you
I summon you again

I call you on the hotline
Hades-666
You promised me a picnic
By the river Styx

Lucifer, you're a devil
Satan what's your game
Beelzebub where are you
I summon you again

We should have lunch in London
Supper in Paris
This art in throwing parties
Just pour vous and me

Oh Lucifer you're a devil
Satan what's your game
Beelzebub where are you
I summon you again
