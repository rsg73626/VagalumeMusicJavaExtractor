BACKSEAT OF MY CAR

I don't care to be scared
When I drive my haunted car
Ghost red hot tonight
My gaze in the rear view mirror

[Refrão]
'cause I see the backseat of my car
Yes I see the backseat of my car
Oh i see the backseat of my car (x2)

Shopping bags falling down
Apples roll, magazine crumpled
In the heat of night
Milk leaks, sucked up by the velvet

[Refrão]

You want a lift ?
Hop in the back
How far do you want to go ?
All the way ?
Ok

[Refrão] (x2)
