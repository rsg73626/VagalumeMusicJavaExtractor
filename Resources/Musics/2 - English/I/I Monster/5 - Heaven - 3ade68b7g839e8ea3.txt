HEAVEN

I look at you
And before my eyes it's true
The girl of my dreams
Is not quite what she seems

Open your door
Turn on the light
Show me some more
Tell me it's alright

[Refrão]
Heaven is inside you
Heaven when I ride you
Heaven do you want me
Is heaven just in my mind ?

I look at you
At everything you do
The words in your head
Still remain unsaid

Open you eyes
Inflatable girl
Lose the disguise
Release me from your spell

[Refrão] (x2)
