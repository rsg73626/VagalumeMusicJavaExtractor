BEAUTY IS IN THE EYES OF THE BEERHOLDER

Don't piss down my back then tell me it is raining.

You just had to walk in before I kicked the table beneath my feet.
If I can't have any friends I thought why not hang from the ceiling.

Just because I ordered, doesn't mean I can't look at the menu.
Not that there's any other fish in this sea I'd rather have on my plater than you.
Just because I FUCKING ordered, doesn't mean I can't look at the menu.
Not that there's any other fish in this sea.

Don't drink and park, accidents in cars cause population.
Fuck "more the merrier" there's only one person I need to feel this sinsation.

If you need directions you can take the road that's down my sleeve,
This time I'm taking you with me, but the cuffs are on you; so good luck trying to leave!

I hope one day I can cross your ocean, without feeling the puncture of your teeth.
Believe me I'd rather drown myself, then knowing you have the power to pull me beneath.

There's so much oxygen that I forgot to breathe…
You're only making things worse, you're only making things worse (I find my self running backwards every time).

Fuck that I changed my fucking mind
Jesus loves you so I won't have to.

I hope you sleep softly with this pillow pressed against your face 

Bêe; :D
