THINGS THAT RHYME WITH ORANGE

I'm so iconoclastic; I'M CLASTIC!
I only want you to think I'm fantastic.
I'll participate in what you believe,
IF YOU GIVE ME THE ATTENTION!
Yeah, yeah that's the only compensation.
I want to be included in your conversation.

So am I "In" or am I "Out"
WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT!?
What is that paint brush for?
Are you preparing to draw me? No wait, please don't! 
I am scared, of what I'll see... I'm not a perfect picture portrait, 
But I am working on it!
I've been thinking about being cool, I must have to admit.

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers In the clouds,
But if it wasn't for you, We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds. 
How am I suppose to chose, Which one I belong to?

It's a marker! IT'S A SIGN! It's something we define!
It already exists, BUT YOU HELPED REFINE!
An emblem for all your aesthetic kin, TO RECOGNIZE YOU BY!

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers In the clouds,
But if it wasn't for you, We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds. 
How am I suppose to chose, Which one I belong to?

Obscenity is a crutch for traffic drives.
If you need to use the restroom just ask politely.
I like the way I do it, better than the way your not.
Lifting up the toilet seat was the way I was taught.

It has to be a unanimous determination,
Because one opinion would be a pointless appreciation.

YEAH, SURE THANKS FOR THE INVITATION!
DON'T WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN YOUR CONVERSATION...
IT'S TO LATE! WE'VE OVER THROWN
I TOOK ALL YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOUR ALL ALONE.

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers In the clouds,
But if it wasn't for you, We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds.
