LIFE HERTZ

Castles are tied to me
Throughout it appears to be a portal at my front door
I can see the dark in me
Maybe you're wrong as I'm watching you sew back that
I'm needing you so much more
I can see the dark in me

I'd do anything for you
Maybe the accent is where you want to prove
I don't know what I felt but I'll ask until the end
Misery is just a crack I fall into sometimes
A crack I fall into sometimes

They must have come for us all of these days
Outside there's a few drops of people that took it somewhere
We were the consequence, naked and confused
I have never felt so relentlessly used

Castles are tied to me
Throughout it appears to be a portal at my front door
I can see the dark in me
Maybe you're wrong as I'm watching you sew back that
I'm needing you so much more
I can see the dark in me

I'd do anything for you
Maybe the accent is where you want to prove
I don't know what I felt but I'll ask until the end
Misery is just a crack I fall into sometimes

A CRACK I FALL INTO SOMETIMES
MAYBE WE SEE SO MUCH WE NEED IT TO BE
YOU SEE THE WAY IT IS
I SEE THE WAY IT COULD BE

I'm your pressure of information
I reveal the close sight, avenge me
Avenge me

I'd do anything for you
Maybe the accent is where you want to prove
I don't know what I felt but I'll ask until the end
Misery is just a crack I fall into sometimes
