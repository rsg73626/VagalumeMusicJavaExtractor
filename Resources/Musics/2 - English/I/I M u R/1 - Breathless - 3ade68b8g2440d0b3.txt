BREATHLESS

It's been awhile since I felt this way
It's been awhile since I've felt
You got this way about you, you got this way about you, you got this way about you
You, you make me melt

Those eyes are greener than the trees that give me oxygen to breathe
Yet leave me breathless
You make me feel a way inside that reminds me of the tide
Swept away

My blood is pumping heart is thumping
Is this all a dream?
Our bodies bumping hips are jumping
Is this all a dream?

Like the smoke from my puff, I don't mind if you hang around
Though when it clears I must admit I feel turned around and around and around
I'm self proclaimed damaged goods babe
I'm not looking to leave that fire
So come with the green and in more ways than one I can take you higher

My blood is pumping heart is thumping
Is this all a dream?
Our bodies bumping hips are jumping
Is this all a dream?
