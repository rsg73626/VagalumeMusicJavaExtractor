I NEED YOUR LOVE

(Ian Hunter)

It was a cold, cold house,
I was a cold, cold room.
No one lived in me.
I was an empty tune.
Lovers came to view
'n' they looked all around.
But they couldn't see nothin',
nothin but the ground, they really put me down
and then someone broke
inside of me
and I found myself learnin'
how to fight free.

And it feels so good
when I can turn to you
'n' look you straight in the eye,
say I need you, need you, oh I need you
I need your love, baby,
I need your love, I gotta hear your name
over and over, over again.
I need your love, baby,
I need your love, I got you up my brain
over, over, over again.

You know it hurts so bad
when you have to say
you ain't got nobody
and then one day
it makes you feel so good
when I can turn to you
and look you straight in the eye,
say I need you, need you, oh I need you
I need your love, baby,
I need your love, I wanna hear your name
over and over, over again.
I need your love,
oh how I need your love, I gotta hear your name
over, over, over again, yeah.
I need your love, baby
I need your love, I gotta hear your name
over, over, over again.
