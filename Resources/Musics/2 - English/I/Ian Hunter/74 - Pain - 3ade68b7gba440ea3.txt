PAIN

(Donnie Kehr/Ian Hunter)

I believe in magic 
Ain't it kinda tragic 
When you find out 
Angels can be devils 
You were never on the level with me babe, at all 

Pain, pain, pain !
I got this pain 
Sittin' on the midnight train 

Beggars can be choosers 
Winners can be losers 
I'll get over you somehow 
It's gonna take a little time 
To put you to the back of my mind, forever 

Pain, shootin' down the length o' my brain 
I got this pain 
Nothin' is the same 
When love is a victim 
Love is a victim of pain 

Ain't no doubt about it babe 
Love is a victim of pain I'm lonely 
And I don't know what to do about you babe 
'Cos Loneliness is such a drag
