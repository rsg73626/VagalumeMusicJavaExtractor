WALK ON WATER

(Ian Hunter/McNasty)

(Transcribed by Justin Purington)

Little flame tormented soul
tried to get lost in all that rock and roll
Came crashing through here like some hurricane
too much too soon for you little flame

[chorus]
You can't walk on water
you can't walk on water, don't try
like a lamb to the slaughter
oh! but for the grace of God go I

Little flame caught that savage sound
he liked to turn it upside down
well I think I know what you were talking about
I'm just so sorry that your flame went out

Fun with no conscience, tracks with no tears
the rich get richer and the devil's got no fears
Sounds his call, political lies
there ain't no virtue without sacrifice

You can't walk on water
You can't walk on water
You can't walk on water
You can't walk on water
You can't walk on water
You can't walk on water

You can't walk on
[repeat and fade]
