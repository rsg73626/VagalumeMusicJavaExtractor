SOMETHIN'S GOIN' ON

(Ian Hunter)

The spirit of war is all around us
'N' everybody knows somethin's goin' on

Fasten your seat belts - say goodbye to your mothers
Cos everybody knows somethin's goin' on

Nuclear missiles - cover to cover
Everybody knows somethin's goin' on

The world is a subway - all the leaders are muggers
'N' everybody knows somethin's goin' on

Well I say
Roll up to the party - welcome to the show
We'll make you live in fear - then we'll make you disappear
Somethin's goin' on 'n' everybody knows

What you got - what you got
Everybody knows somethin's goin' on
Most people got nothin' - a few got the lot
'N' everybody knows - it's still goin' on

Well I say
Roll up to the circus - welcome to death row
Just do what we say - then we'll blow you all away
Somethin's goin' on 'n' everybody knows

What about hunger... are they just another number?
We're all an endangered species
'N' everybody knows - it's still goin' on

Well I say
Welcome to Thanksgiving - what we reap is what we sow
We'll watch you die in vain from the safety of our plane
Somethin's goin' on 'n' everybody knows
