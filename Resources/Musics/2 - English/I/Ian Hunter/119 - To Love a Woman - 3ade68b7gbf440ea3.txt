TO LOVE A WOMAN

(Ian Hunter)

To love a woman
Lost and lonely through the night
My baby doesn't hear me right
Cross my heart and hope to die
The words won't come although I try
It's there beneath me deep and strong
And when I speak it sounds so wrong
Oh cross my heart and hope to die
I'll never know the reason why
You and I were so in love
And if the sun won't shine
I'll be warm enough for the both of us
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman

Sometimes when I'm away from you
I love you more you know its true
Oh cross my heart and hope to die
This loneliness is good sometimes
And you'll return smile over me
And I still can't say what's plain to see
But cross my heart and hope to die
You'll never know how hard I try
You and I we fell in love
And if the sun won't shine
I'll be warm enough for the both of us
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman

Loving a woman like you ain't hard to do
You know it happens all the time
To love a woman another woman
To love a woman ain't never been hard
(Cross my heart and hope to die)
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman

So I'll go on through this night
Wishing the words to come out right
Cross my heart and hope to die
This stubborn tongue's gonna make me cry
Just accept me as I am
Understand I'm a quiet man
Cross my heart and hope to die
I dread the day you say goodbye
You and I we fell in love
And if the sun won't shine
I'll be warm enough for the both of us
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
To love a woman
