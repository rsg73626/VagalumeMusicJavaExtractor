BEG A LITTLE LOVE

(Hunter/McNasty)

Life takes a little piece of you away
Most everyday of your life
Oh learn to get wise, you learn to compromise-
You learn to criticise yourself
I guess we all grow up 'cos one day everything-
seems so further from the truth
And you try to find yourself- in this endless youth
I said you try to find yourself-and you
Beg a little love

Fate takes another stab at your face
And you can never cease to resist
And you take it on the chin-that old sucker punch again
Reminds you what you've missed
When the colors blazed and your jealousy raged
You were so sensitive to every touch
And it ain't to forget in this endless youth
So you find a perfect stranger- and you
Beg a little love

What do you get in the end
Did you really need that friend
Your emotions dulled to save your heart
From failing at the hardest part
But you still get down on your knees
I said you get down n your knees
And you beg

Now there's nothing left to laugh at
Nothing left to say-nothing left do
There's nothing left-so there's nothing left to ask for
But you still get down on your knees- and you beg

These words are my sacrificial lamb
Burnin' a hole down my heart
Dancin' down that river of no return
You know you missed that boat- but you still get
down on your knees

Afterall o' those years
Afterall o' those fears
Afterall o' those dreams
Afterall o' those screams
Aferall o' those nights
Afterall o' those fights

When my mind had gone, when both o' my minds had gone
When my minds had gone

I'm still a child
And I get down on my knees and I beg
Beg a little love
