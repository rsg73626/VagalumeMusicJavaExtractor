GOOD MAN IN A BAD TIME

Inside, closed quarters
Night's calling under blood red skies
This madness, starts burning
The victim of a strange desire
Mistaken, we follow
Restless emotions take you down
Unwilling, still hunger
For lustful pleasures I have found
He's a good man in a bad time
He's a good man in a bad time

Soft voices, seduce you
A butterfly in a spider's web
Infectious, behavior
You're damned to do it all again (and again and again and again...)
He's a good man in a bad time
He's a good man in a bad time

Don't cry, darling
I'll be with you
All night, darling
Deep within you
He's a good man in a bad time
He's a good man in a bad time
He's a good man in a bad time
He's a good man in a bad time
He's a good man in a bad time
