WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE

(Ian Hunter)

It's such a small town rodeo
Such famous people here, with nowhere to go
Well it don't get to me, I think it's the pits
I got no friends, I wanna split.

The daily papers seek a desperate face
The television cameras join in the chase
It's much fun interviewing urban decay
I grab the microphone away

(Dance) No! (Dance) No! (Dance) No! (Dance) No!

We gotta get out of here
We gotta get out of here right now
We gotta get out of here
We gotta get out of here right now

Hey Rock and Roll feel the holes in my brain
I promise you I'll never come here again
It's all so sad, what a waste of a night
Cause nothing's wrong, but nothing's right (hey)

So don't get along, out of my way
I'm not a robot, I've got something to say
It's such a joke, are you ready to go
Here comes that beat again, oh oh oh oh

(Dance) No! (Dance) No! (Dance) No! (Dance) No!
We gotta get out of here
We gotta get out of here right now
We gotta get out of here
We gotta get out of here right now
We gotta get out of, we gotta get out
We gotta get out of here right now
We gotta get out of, we gotta get out
We gotta get out of here right now
[repeat while Ellen speaks]

(Oh please I don't wanna go home yet
Come on, can't you do anything I wanna do?
Lets dance, come on please, just once for me
I never get to do anything like this
You're such a drag, you know that?
Everything for you, everything for you, nothing for me, right
What are we gonna do? Go home and watch the Super Bowl
Re-runs of the Mohammed Ali uh Marlene Dietrich fight, what?
There must be somebody here who wants to dance with me
There must be a lot of people here who would like to dance with me, you know
that?
Come on, one, two, three, four - I'll jump right up and do the bump(?), come on

Listen this place gets really good, this place gets really.....
I heard that the that the the spoon comes down and the moon comes down and
the stars and all sorts of great stuff happens in a little while).
