SILENT MOVIE

(Corky Laing/Ian Hunter)

Well the school bell rings
I carried your things
Getting on the yellow bus
With the whole world watching us

And our love was like a silent movie
Ain't got nothing to say
Our love was like a silent movie
I wish we could have kept it that way

Now the door bell rings
I'm gonna get my things
Take another bright (?)
At the lion's side

Cause our love was like a silent movie
Ain't got nothing to say
Our love was like a silent movie
That's the all-American way

Silent Movie

And our love was like a silent movie
There's nothing to say
Our love was like a silent movie
And that's the all-American way
 
And our love was like a silent movie
There's nothing to say
Our love was like a silent movie
I wish we could have kept it that way

Our love was like a silent movie
Silent movie
Our love was like a silent movie
I wish we could have kept it that way
