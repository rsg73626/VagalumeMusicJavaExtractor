PSYCHO GIRL

(Honest John Plain)

If I'd known then what I know now
I'd do it all again 'cause I'm crazy and how
About my mixed-up, messed-up pretty little Psycho Girl
I should've given her a swift body swerve
I didn't so I got what I deserve
A freaked-out, spaced-out crazy little Psycho Girl

Psycho Girl - look what you're doing
How come you have to be this way?
Psycho Girl - you'll be my ruin
With the softy things you do - the silly things you say
oh oh Psycho Girl

She's my cross to bear, my ball and chain
A monkey on my back, she gets into my brain
But I love my washed out, freaked out Psycho Girl
Yeah, if I'd known then what I know now
I wouldn't change a thing, no way no how
'Cause I love my blown out, zonked out Psycho Girl

So what if she's mixed up, messed up, freaked out
Washed up, fucked up, spaced out
I'm no doubt - I'm crazy about my Psycho Girl
Psycho - Psycho Girl
