NO ONE

(Ian Hunter)

I used to come home each night to no one - no one
All by myself, turn out the light - no one - no one
One knife, a fork 'n' a spoon
An empty bed in a cold room
Oooh I needed someone - maybe you could help
I called you up, I said "There's no one, baby there's no one else"

No one ever looked twice at me - no one - no one
Take a look at my life - what do you see - no one - no one
Kinda nervous 'n' jealous too - I lose me if I lose you
Just when I was feeling sorry for myself
She called me back, she said, "There's no one, baby there's no one else"

With no one to call you - with no one rootin' for you
With no one to adore you - you'd be lost and alone
With no one to kiss you - with no one to miss you
And always be with you - you would turn into stone

I've been waiting for the longest time
To hold your hand on Sunday
Oooh I needed someone - I saw you and I fell
I called you up, I said, "There's no one - and I'll never want anyone else"

Baby there's no one else
Baby there's no one else
Baby there's no one else
