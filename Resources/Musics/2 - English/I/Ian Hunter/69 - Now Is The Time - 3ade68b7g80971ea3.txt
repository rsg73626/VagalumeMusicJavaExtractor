NOW IS THE TIME

(Ian Hunter)

(Transcribed by Justin Purington; minor correction by Colin Ford)

I can smile
On a warm summer day
I can laugh
I can listen to the children play
But I'm going to miss
The killer with the kiss
He was a friend of mine
Now is the time
Now is the time

It's going to rain
Hope it don't rain on you
There's going to be a lot of pain
Before this thing is through
If Jesus was alive
He'd be standing on the M5
Holding up a neon sign
Screaming now is the time
Now is the time

Now is the time
So many people can't see
They think that love is blind
But it ain't free
There's a line
So many people have crossed
And now their love is lost
Say goodbye
My funny valentine
Now is the time
Now is the time

Now is the time
Now is the time

I can run
Just as far as my eyes can see
And I'm free, yeah,
Just as free as I want to be
But I won't ever forget
That crazy little planet
He was a friend of mine

Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
