JUST ANOTHER NIGHT

(Ian Hunter/Mick Ronson)

Oh no, the fuzz, all in a line
My oh my, I think I'm gonna die
And it's just another night
It's just another night

Got a long black face; Who goes there?
All the reefer madnessput a poor kid in jail
And it's just another night
Yeah, it's just another night

Oh take it easy boy or it's DOA
Chrome on my body and a lot of folks say
That it's just another night
Hey, It's just another night
Oh, it's just another night on the other side of life

Head one's a saw-bones and he wrecked my chair
Said "How'd you like to do it in a room downstairs"
And it's just another night
Oh, just another night

Hey now, Papa Joe, Don't you pull my hair
All this intrigue, it gets me out of my league
And it's just another night
It's just another night

His old man spent a fortune just to get him in
But baby boy growed up just as stupid as him
And it's just another night
It's just another night
It's just another night on the other side of life

Just another night, hung down slow
I don't like the hotel let me go
Hells bells! Give me a chance!
This rock 'n' roller don't wanna dance
Just another night
Just another night
Well, it's just another night on the other side of life

I never felt so bad; Where's my shades?
It's gonna be a long one getting crazed
A head spoutin' noodles said, "What do you plead?"
I said "You ain't got to touch a man to make a man bleed"

'N' it's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night (on the other side)
It's just another night!
