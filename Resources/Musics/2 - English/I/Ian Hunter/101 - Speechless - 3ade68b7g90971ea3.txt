SPEECHLESS

(Ian Hunter)

Every time I watch you
Gotta switch you off, you surely can't be serious
Every time I see you
I just can't believe you go below ridiculous

All those days I spent
Starin' at your wilderness
All those ways you got to me
Through me, you, you leave me speechless

You, you make me scared of you
You make me scared of losing concentration
You make me afraid of you
Make me afraid of losing conversation

All my friends say that you're forbidden - fruitless
I hide away with you - I'm guilty - I'm guilty
You found my only weakness
You, you leave me speechless

Entertainment came and went
Why can't you be more curious, adventurous, mysterious, sensuous

Your remote control
Is sending out patrols, I've go consumer sadness
Spray me - camouflage me - blind me
So I can't see, help me through this madness

All those years I spent
Clingin' to your warm breast
All those words
I don't think I guess

Gotta get you off my chest - you pest
You, you leave me speechless
