GOD (TAKE 1)

(Ian Hunter)

God said to me "Gonna kick your ass - 'cos all you do is ask ask ask 
All that energy looking for me when I'm sitting here inside you - plain to see 
How I built you cell for cell gave you sights to see - gave you tales to tell 
Even let you help yourself for a while - to take some weight off this busy child"

I said to God "I found you out - I know what this world is all about!"
God said "Stop - don't scramble your brain - my opponent's been messing you around again
See him and me are enemies and we play little games for galaxies
And he's inside you - 'n I am too - so here we are - just the three of you"

"Oh we made mistakes - too many cards - but making human beings can be hard
A God gets tired of playing so much chess - he wishes his God would get him out of his mess"
I said to God "What's it like to die" He said "It's as plain as the sea and sky
Conception was him and me and you - when your batteries fade we all just move on"

I said to God "Who's winning this game - is the devil in front" He said "Is that his name
You know I've been so busy I never asked - I never looked up from this awesome task"
I said to God "What's good 'n bad" He said "It's just something you've got to have
It don't mean nothing to us up here - but your primitive people - you gotta have fear"

I said to God "Do I think for myself" He said I told you once you just help yourself
Don't forget you're composed of three, your thinking comes from him and me"
I said to God "How big are you, is there a religion - is it true
How big's the universe - is time - the same for you as my life is to mine"


God said "If all the things that made worlds float - were all to part - then you would note
The size of him and the size of me - and that's how big we both shall be" 

He said "The universe is small - just like some fortune-teller's ball
And we both sit down - and we play the game - when somebody wins it all starts again"

"There's no religion - you did that - it helps to keep your little leaders fat
Like faith 'n superstition stay - to help you pass the time away
But when you talk of time and life - it makes me think of circles, heights
Expansion is the clue - your dreams - are nearer than you've ever been" 

"You see my little toy to think - is from two bowls of wine to drink 
Don't take too much or you may drown - behave yourself - see you around..."
