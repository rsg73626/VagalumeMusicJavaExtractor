LISA LIKES ROCK N' ROLL

(Ian Hunter)

There's a wango-tango
at the peppermint inn
I'm gonna be there
Shakin' my thing
be bop a lula
little Peggy Sue
we both got company
don't know what to do
but that's alright
yeah that's OK
In the middle of the night
here's Lisa

CHORUS:
Lisa likes rock 'n' roll,
she plays it every day.
Down by the drugstore
everybody ??
She turnin' on the radio,
she's shootin' up the stereo,
puttin' on a video,
she's sayin' let's go let's go

Lisa won't marry me,
she says she's only four.
Her mum don't like me,
she says I'm too mature.
Down at the disco,
I go solo
and the girls don't wanna know,
I've been too slow.
And that's alright,
and that's OK,
in the middle of the night.
Here's Lisa.

CHORUS
And when you see her
you wish you could ?? her.
Ain't no one can beat her.
She goes yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, "You're my daddy."

I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
I know Lisa likes rock 'n' roll
Yeah!
