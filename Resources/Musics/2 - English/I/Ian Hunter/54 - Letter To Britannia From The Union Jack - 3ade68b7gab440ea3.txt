LETTER TO BRITANNIA FROM THE UNION JACK

(Ian Hunter)

Poor Britannia - drowning in your waves
With the Body of the unknown soldier and the best of the brave
I have known you ever since I was a child
How come you don't salute me - now - when I smile

You was always so young and on all o' that money
How come new mourners pass you by and think it's so funny
I'd be there with you but I'm chained unto this stake
For I am loyalty but my mast I cannot forsake

I looked down on a bunch of amusements, I looked down walls
I've looked on hangings 'n parades 'n city halls
And I've seen love in so many living rooms
And I've seen rich men slowly die inside their tombs

I know we're just two charms but it's heavy on my mind
Have faith in me I said, now, look at time
I know you're just a victim of your history but
Have faith in me, I said and you would be free....

You pull me up and you pull me down
And when the Queen's in residence I hang around
I don't wave madly 'cos the climate's civilised
Just flutter sadly 'cos I'm old 'n I'm wise

And you-you been up, and you - you been down
You been through many things I know you been around
I have fought armies for you in the conflicts of the past
Britannia, I implore you, do not lower me by half.
