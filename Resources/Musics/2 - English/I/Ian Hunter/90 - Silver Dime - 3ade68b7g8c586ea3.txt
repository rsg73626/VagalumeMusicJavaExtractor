SILVER DIME

Alice was a drunken mona lisa
Arching up some american wall
She said I really want to please you
I said that’s easy let yourself fall
All you got to do is go
Ride on down rock and roll
Shine on miss silver dime
Ride on down rock and roll
Blow my sweet mind
Blow my sweet mind

As I was posing down some empty broken street
Said the world is coming to an end
She screamed out loudly
I’m so lonely I’m so lonely
I’m so lonely I’m so lonely
I said on me you can depend
All you got to do is go
Ride on down rock and roll
Shine on miss silver dime
Ride on down rock and roll
Blow my sweet mind
Blow my sweet mind

She sucked so sadly on this feather tail
She got me up when I was down
She plays the music and when the music fades
I want her to get me up I want her to get me up
I want her to get me up I want her to get me up
I want her to get me up get me up
Get me up get me up get me up get me up
Get me up get me up get me up get me up
All you got to do is go
Ride on down rock and roll
Shine on miss silver dime
Ride on down rock and roll
Blow my sweet mind
Blow my sweet mind
Ride on down rock and roll
Shine on miss silver dime
Ride on down rock and roll
Blow my sweet mind
Blow my sweet mind
All you got to do is go
(fade)
