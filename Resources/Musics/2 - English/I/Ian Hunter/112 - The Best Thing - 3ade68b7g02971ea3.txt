THE BEST THING

(Corky Laing)

You try to love the way that you did before
But he don't be that loved anymore and I'm
I'm coming from the pouring rain
My eyes are red but they still see through
The feeling that's coming over you
And I'd love to come again (come again)
I wanna love you over again 
You, you wanna know
You're the best thing that's happening to me
In a long long time
Be wise, open up your eyes
You, you wanna know
You're the best thing that's happening to me
'N I wanna love again.

I try (I try) to put your body right out of my mind
But you keep on coming on and on
I thought it was just for  last night
A passing fancy, a bird in flight
But you keep on coming on
So I wanna come again
I wanna love you over again
(I wanna love you over again)
I love to love you over again
You, you, you wanna know
You're the best thing that's happening to me
In a long long time 
Be wise, I wanna love again
Come on love again
Come on love again
You, you wanna know
Come on love again
I wanna come again
You, you wanna know
You're the best thing that's happening to me
 
You, you wanna know
You're the best thing that's happening to me
You, you wanna know
