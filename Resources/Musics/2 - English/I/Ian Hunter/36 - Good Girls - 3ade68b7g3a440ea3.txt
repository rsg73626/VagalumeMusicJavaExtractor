GOOD GIRLS

(Honest John Plain)

It's cold outside - it looks like rain
To make matters worse, I missed me last train
Now I was thinking she'd show me a bed
To my surprise got shown the door instead
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?

She said she wants a fella with a GTI
Always home on time, steak and kidney pie
She made it quite pretty, it was plain to see
There's no place here for a rocker like me
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?

Girls like Peggy-Sue, Maggie-May and Sheena too
Where have all the good girls gone?
Girls like my dear old Mum, who never stopped me having fun
Where have all the good girls gone?
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Where've they gone?
Where have all the good (3) girls gone? (2)

So she throws me out in the pouring rain
Girls like that give girls a bad name
Why can't I find a girl just like Betty D.
With an hourglass figure like Norma Jean
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?
Where 've they gone?
