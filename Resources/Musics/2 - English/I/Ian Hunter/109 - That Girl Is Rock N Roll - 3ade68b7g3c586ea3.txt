THAT GIRL IS ROCK N ROLL

She dresses in leather
She isn't too together
She looks then she lowers her eyes at me

She smokes cigarettes
She likes to get wet
And she's about a woman as a woman can be i said

That girl is rock 'n' roll

She got the cutest figure
I think it's gettin' bigger
She's about, hangin' out, over me

She feels just right
In the middle of the night
'n' she's about a woman as a woman can be i said

That girl is rock 'n' roll
