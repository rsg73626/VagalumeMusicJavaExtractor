RED LETTER DAY

(Ian Hunter)

Red Letter Day (3) mmmm...
Late at night I drift away somewhere 
I'm walking on the moon - talking to you there 
I miss you babe, oh I miss you 
In my empty room on a crowded avenue
Oh I've been rolling down the river, girlAnd I bump into you
I miss you babe, oh I miss you
When I come home the love is gonna last forever
'Cause deep in my heart, the loving never went away
When I come home, the love is gonna last forever
It's going to be a Red Letter Day (3) oh-oh
Why oh why oh why can't we see eye to eye
All we do is argue and the years go rolling by
How on earth could it be worth such a sacrifice
All we got's each other and I'm lonely in this life
I miss you girl oh I miss you

When I come home the love is gonna last forever
'Cause deep in my heart, the loving never went away
When I come home, the love is gonna last forever
It's going to be a Red Letter Day (many times)

Leave your light on 'cause I've waited so long
