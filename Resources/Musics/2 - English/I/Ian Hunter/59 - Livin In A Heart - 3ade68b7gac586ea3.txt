LIVIN IN A HEART

Once upon a time, somewhere in the back of my mind
I fell in love with you
But then, everything went wrong, I couldn't even write a song
There was nothing to look forward to

I don't go out very much, I'm always home on my own
Baby I was just too blind to see
I wasn't to conquer the world but the world had a mind of its own
Maybe I tried a little too hard
Maybe I pushed you away too far

Gotta room in your heart for a lonely heart
Gotta room in your heart for two
It might be nice-living in a heart with you

So sing and all the world will shine, somewhere in this nursery rhyme
A happy ending lies-for all the lovers with the lonely eyes
Easy come-easy go-this is just to let you know
Baby I apologize

How could I turn away love, how could I turn into stone
How could I turn my back on you
I wanted to be a success but success ever leaves you alone
Maybe I tried a little too hard
Maybe I pushed you way too far
