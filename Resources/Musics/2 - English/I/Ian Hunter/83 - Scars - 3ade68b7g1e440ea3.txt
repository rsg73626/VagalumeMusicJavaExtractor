SCARS

(Ian Hunter/Darrell Bath/Honest John Plain)

Well I still got your blood running through my veins
I still got your blood running through my veins
And even though the circumstances change
I know we never got along - the pieces would not fit
And I still got the scars to show for it

Staring through the window at the rain
Is it me or have all the colours changed?
I was sick with jealousy
I know why you had to split 
And you still got the scars to prove it.

I can't see them, but I can feel them
They're tearing me up inside
I feel them kicking - I feel them sticking
Like something in me died
And it's all right - I wish you the very best
I just had to get it/this off my chest
People tell me on the street that you don't give a 
I took that kind of hard
It's just another kind of scar I got to show for it
It's just another scar I got to show for it
I still got your blood running through my vein 
But I still got your blood running through my vein
I still got your blood running through my vein
