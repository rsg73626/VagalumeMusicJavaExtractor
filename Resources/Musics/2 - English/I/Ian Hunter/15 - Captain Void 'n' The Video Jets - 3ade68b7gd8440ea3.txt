CAPTAIN VOID 'N' THE VIDEO JETS

(Ian Hunter)

Captain to Candida - we just hit earth
Everyone's strange here - don't know what they're worth
Got this idea - we're gonna be machines
We'll play a part in their imaginary dreams

Say hi - hi - hi
Have you ever stopped to figure out why
We're Captain Void 'n' the Video Jets
Go go get - go go get
Your Captain Void 'n' the Video Jets
We're the original space cadets

Captain to Candida - we're spreading fast
They're watchin' us - watching them throught the glass
We got them hypnotized - under our control
We're nearly ready to put the world on hold

Say hi - hi - hi
Have you ever stopped to figure out why
We're Captain Void 'n' the Video Jets
Place your bets - place your bets
On Captain Void 'n' the Video Jets
We hide inside your T.V. set

We don't hit lovers - we leave them alone
We just hit children who rot in their homes
Something is happening
Now Mr. Jones just touch me (c'mon)
Turn me on!
