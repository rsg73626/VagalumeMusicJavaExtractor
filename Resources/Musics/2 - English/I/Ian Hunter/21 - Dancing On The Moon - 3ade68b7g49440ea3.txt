DANCING ON THE MOON

(Ian Hunter/Darrell Bath/Honest John Plain)

(Transcribed by Colin Ford)

Oh!!
Well I climbed through the fence, out with the (?), head for the river plate(?).
The river's not tame, heat in the city meant dogs can't smell the same.
Don't wait up, I'll be home soon, but I can't come now cos I'm
Dancing on the (dancing, dancing) moon, yeah.
(dancing, dancing....) 

I crawl like a snake, seen a better daybreak, I sleep when I'm wide awake. 

All my body's achin', I know they're tryin' to break me, but that's a chance I
gotta take.
Oh, don't wait up, I'll be home soon, but I can't come now cos I'm
Dancing, dancing, dancing (dancing on the moon) dancing, dancing, dancing on
the moon
All right.

I'm outside a Memphis, My motors little danger(?) she gives me
pharmaceuticals
Knowin' my friends, they help me beat the hangman, they know I'm innocent
Well that's all right, I'll be home soon, but I can't come now cos I'm
Dancing, dancing (dancing, dancing) on the moon
(dancing, dancing on the moon) .

I can see your house in between the trees
I can feel your body shakin' in between my knees.
You know it feels so low, I come so far
I always love to have some fire on me

You're looking so good

Well I got me a room, can't say where it is, you can guess the address
Well I need some money, need it in a special place, not try the weaknesses(?) 

Wake up (?), nursin' my wounds, I told you I was comin, I was comin' home soon. yeah.

(Want you, want you, want you, want you right away, )
