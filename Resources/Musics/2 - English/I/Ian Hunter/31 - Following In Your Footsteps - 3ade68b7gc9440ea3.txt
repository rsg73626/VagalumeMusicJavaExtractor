FOLLOWING IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS

(Ian Hunter/Mick Ronson)

Some folk leave courage, 
some folk leave you hope 
Why am I out here hangin'
like a fool at the end o' my rope 
Some folk leave you wisdom, 
some folk leave you signs 
You can never be sure 
what went on before 
Life is just a matter of time 

Picture of you, 
clouding my view 
I'm following in your footsteps, 
tryin' to make some sense of it all 
Maybe it's a sign of weakness, 
but that's where my footsteps fall 
I'm following in your footsteps, 
tryin' to hang on to your dreams 
You never got what you wanted 
So I never got what I need 
I'm following in your footsteps, 
'cos that's where the footsteps lead 

Someone must have given me anger, 
someone must have given me hate 
Or why would I stand here shakin',
when there's so many chances to take 

Pictures of you, 
climb into view 
I'm following in your footsteps, 
tryin' to make some sense of it all 
Maybe it's a sign of weakness, 
but that's where my footsteps fall 

I'm following in your footsteps, 
watchin' my children grow 
They're following in my footsteps 
Takin' it on the road 
We're following in your footsteps 
'cos that's where the footsteps go 
We're following in your footsteps, yeah 
'cos that's where your footsteps go
