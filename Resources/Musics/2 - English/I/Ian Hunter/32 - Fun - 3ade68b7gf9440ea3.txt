FUN

(Ian Hunter/Mark Clarke/Hilly Michaels)

I got a shower curtain stickin' to my back
And the o'd' cologne sure packs a whack
I got blood on my razor - my face is in shock
'N' my hair hangin' down like a Rastaman's locks

I think I'm ready - I'm gettin' ready
Gettin' ready Teddy - we're all gonna have fun

I gotta rock 'n' roll - rocket says "you gotta go fast"
'N' the radio's blarin' out a blast from the past
Lucille's in the back screamin' "gimme a break"
Your momma didn't tell you - that's the chance you take

It's oh so sad
When this love is all that we have
To swallow a lifetime away
With so many hours in each day

But calm your foolish heart
Our girlfriend's can't keep us apart
I'm with you every step of the way
Baby - what more can I say

The only problem is
I wanna party - get down - boogie - have a great time
Well its 36.50 for a room with a view
O' the empire state 'n' the pizza place, too

Lucille's got my body in a total eclipse
She's all lips 'n' hips - you know - one o' those trips
We're gettin' ready - she's gettin' ready
