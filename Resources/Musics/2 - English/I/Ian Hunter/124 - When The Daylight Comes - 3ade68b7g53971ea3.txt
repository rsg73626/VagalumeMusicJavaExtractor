WHEN THE DAYLIGHT COMES

(Ian Hunter)

Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo

Sweet woman what's your name?
You smell as fresh as the rain
Instead of leaving you came
let me feel your hair

A light shines in your eyes
The hungry years are so nice
Shadows shake in the lamplight
No writer could explain

But when the daylight comes
But when the daylight comes
But when the daylight comes
I'll be on my way

Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo, yeah!

Please share my bed and I swear
That I won't touch you nowhere
Just need your warmth and your care
Don't wanna mess around

And when the daylight comes
Yeah when the daylight comes
Oh when the daylight comes
I'll be on my way

Yeah when the daylight comes
Yeah when the daylight comes
Yeah when the daylight comes
I'll be on my way

But there's a song in the air
and it knows that you're there
'cause it's making me share
you with my life
I know I know I know that
I want to weave you in words
want to paint you in verse
want to leave you in someone else's dreams
it seems the only way, Hey!
I can thank you, thank you baby

Some people say that we're sinners
Some people say that we're winners
We make good gossip at dinners
They try to pin us down

But when the daylight comes
Yeah when the daylight comes
Oh when the daylight comes
I'll be on my way

Yeah when the daylight comes
Yeah when the daylight comes
Oh when the daylight comes
We'll be on my way

(Repeat and fade)
