JUNKEE LOVE

(Matheson/Casino Steel)

Give me magic misery
Give me two shots - first one is free
Watch me cover - watch me grin
Jump for the juice in your syringe
You're the poison - you're the pain
You're the needle in my vein
Come on jab it - come go quick
The only habit I can't kick
Junkee see - junkee do
Junkee me - junk is you
Pusher comes to shove
Junkee love

ooh...I've got my trembles - I got the shakes
I'm a slave to my mistakes
Dial doctor on the phone
Get me on methadone
Give me magic misery
Give me two shots - first one is free
Watch me cover - watch me cringe
All from using your syringe
Junkee see - junkee do
Junkee me - junk is you
Pusher comes to shove
Junkee love
