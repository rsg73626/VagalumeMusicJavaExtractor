DEATH OF A NATION

(Ian Hunter)

I was having a drink with Prince Charles and the Queen
When Winston Churchill stepped into my dream
His head it was heavy, his voice was shakin'
He said, "Look what they've done - it's the death of a Nation"
 
I followed his shadow right out of the bar
And we talked all night 'neath the light of the stars
He said, "This used to be a cradle of civilization
Now look what they've done - it's the death of a Nation"
 
Everything's illusion now, nothing's what it seems
Money isn't everything, when you're turning your back on a dream
I held you together when you were breakin'
You can pull down the flags- it's the death of a Nation
 
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye,
'N we'll never die, no we'll never die
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye,
'N we'll never die, no we will never die
 
From the bottom of this ancient heart
I hate to see you falling apart
Cos I love you still, I love you still, I love you still
 
You've been getting away with it far too long
Your promises ain't worth the paper they're printed on
I had a love, but that love's been forsaken
Look what they've done, it's the death of a Nation.
 
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye,
'N we'll never die, no we'll never die
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye,
'N we'll never die, no we will never die
 
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye,
'N I'll never die, no I will never die
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye,
