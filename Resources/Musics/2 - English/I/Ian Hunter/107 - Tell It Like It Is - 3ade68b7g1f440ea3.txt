TELL IT LIKE IT IS

(Ian Hunter/Mick Ronson)

Do you remember truth-you used to tell it everyday
Oh what a feelin'-there was nuthin' in the way
I won't get excited- if you don't slash your wrists
oh oh oh-something is gravely amiss
You gotta tell it like it is

Whats the matter baby- cat got your tongue?
You bin creepin' 'round the alleyways-all night long
You can't hide a secret-more than a week
oh oh oh- we gotta get to the bottom of this
You gotta tell it like it is

Hangin' on a corner- of the danger zone
Just another nightmare- let me take you home

C'mon baby, c'mon baby

You've gotta tell it like it is...
