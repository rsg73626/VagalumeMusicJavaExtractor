EVERYONE'S A FOOL

(Darrell Bath/Roig)

He asked me home at a midnight
Hey you'll be lucky if it's daylight
When you saw me down the alley
Yeah I swear's I'm not with Annie, hey Annie, yeah
'Cause everyone's a fool, child
Everyone's wild
I'll say I was your fool, babe
'Cause you know that's a lie

Now everybody gets lonesome
And we all need a friend
So take it easy baby-love
I'm not here to do you in
'Cause everyone's a fool, child
Everyone's wild
I'll say I was your fool, babe
'Cause you know that's a lie

Oooh, once in a while
Any old time
And that's no lie

She'll be showing up at midnight
And everyone wanna taste right
So you better get your do-re-mi all right
Or she won't be getting paid
Everyone's a fool, child
Everyone's wild
Don't say I was your fool, babe
'Cause you know that's a lie
Hey that's all right
Oh, once in a while
It might be any old time
Well, that's ain't no lie
Well, maybe a little one
