OLD RECORDS NEVER DIE

(Ian Hunter)

Sometimes you realize
that there is an end to life.
Yesterday I heard them say
a hero's blown away.
And it's so hard to lose
someone who's close to you.
Oh me, I did not see
the danger every day.
But music's something in the air,
so he can play it anywhere.
Old records never die.

Get you're healing from a song,
just when everything goes wrong.
Play it right
through the night
till morning brings you light.
And if some folk laugh at you
Let 'em all laugh they never knew.
Oh all those scenes, to me it seems
some folk never dream.
??, I feel a force
rebel with some other cause.
Old records never die.

Old records never die.
You can watch the waves roll by.
You can see it in their eyes.
Old records never die.
Old records never die.
You can watch the waves roll by.
??
Old records never die.
I can hear you
and I know why
old records never die.
