HOW MUCH MORE CAN I TAKE

(Ian Hunter)

You're breakin' my heart 
Stealing my thunder 
How much more can I take 
You're draggin' me down 
Holding me under 
How much more can I take 

How much more can I take 
Won't somebody break 
The news to you gently. 
You fill  my eyes 
But you don't fill the hunger 
How much more can I take 

I see your face 
Everywhere, everyplace 
How much more can I take 
You're here in the night 
You're here in the morning sunlight 
How much more can I take 

How much more can I take 
I (wish that I could) make your mind up (for you). 
You fill  my eyes 
But you don't fill the hunger 
How much more can I take

How much more can I take 
Won't somebody help me 
I'm naked as the day I was born 
These clothes have a way 
of changin' what I'm feelin' 
I try and I try but I can't put 'em on 

I sit here alone 
Wait by the telephone line 
How much more can I take 
I'm jealous as hell 
Mixed up 'n mean as well 
How much more can I take 

How much more can I take 
I know she'd like to break 
Those stones over my body. 
You fill  my eyes 
But you don't fill the hunger 
How much more can I take
