MAN O'WAR

(Ian Hunter/Mick Ronson)

I never brush my teeth and I never wash
I guess I never bother with no brush
I don't care about a knife and fork
And don't you argue with the way that I talk
And all you ladies want my autograph
And have you seen my photo, have you seen my photographs....yeah

I hit the city when the sun goes down
I get this feeling that I'm running around
I love virgins, I like 'em petite
Cute little sister won't you sit on me
End up scoring, over 5 dollars down
You don't have to tell me I'm a clown

Cause I'm a bad mother - try me and see
I'm a bad mother - check my I.D.
I'm a bad mother - got nothing to do
If I could spit, I'd spit all over you.

I'm a Man O' War, hey hey
The demon of the semen, I'm a Man O' War
And you know it for sure, yeah
You better get back on your feet, I'm a Man O' War

I tell my woman that I got this disease
She says, "Honey, please, get down on your knees"
"You look so sexy when you sing with the band
Tie me up, tie me up, tie my hand".
How'd you like to do it with the leader of the pack
Cause baby, ain't got the germs and bad seeds back(?)

Cause I'm a bad mother - I get around
I'm a bad mother - I know the sound
I'm a bad mother - nothing to do
If I could spell, I'd put a spell on you

Cause I'm a Man O' War hey hey
Ain't nobody told you I'm a Man O' War
I got a gun for show, yeah
So get up on your feet I'm a Man O' War
(Come on Mickey)

Cause I'm a bad mother - check me and see
I'm a bad mother - I got VD
I'm a bad mother - got nothing to do, oh
If I could spit, I'd spit all over you

I'm a Man O' War hey hey
The demon of the semen, I'm a Man O' War
And you know it for sure, yeah
Oh baby get up on your feet, I'm a Man O' War

I'm a Man O' War, I'm a Man O' War
Give me an image, I'll take it to the limit
I'm a Man O' War, I'm a Man O' War
Mamma's little soldier, I'm a Man O' War
All right, yeah.
