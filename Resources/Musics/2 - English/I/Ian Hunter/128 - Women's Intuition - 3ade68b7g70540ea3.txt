WOMEN'S INTUITION

(Ian Hunter)

Through the haze the mirror cries-hits you right between the eyes
You don't know-but you got the judas in you babe
You can't trust
You can't deliver
Always whinin' you were sold down the river
I gave you-the best years of-your miserable life

Where did you go wrong girl, where did you go wrong
Where did you go wrong babe-nice try, wrong guy
You're gonna wind up on your ass-you should have listened to your
WOMEN'S INTUITION

You can come (run)-but you can't hide-something messed you up inside
Ain't my fault-don't blame me-if you're dazed and confused
You're a lie, you're a television, tryin't drag into your prison
Had enough o'sleepin' rough-its over with you

where did you go wrong babe
Where did you go wrong
Where did you go wrong girl
Nice try
Goodbye
You're gonna wind up on your ass-you should;ve listened to your
WOMEN'S INTUITION

Tarred by the same old feathers-guess we got to stick together
But I say to you-don't ever invade-my destiny
Bad enough I ain't normal, give up tryin't make me formal
What I need when I bleed
Don't mean nothing to you

Where did you go wrong babe, where did you go wrong
Where did you go wrong girl
Dumb moves, no class
You're gonna wind up on your ass-you should 've listened to your
WOMEN'sINTUITION
