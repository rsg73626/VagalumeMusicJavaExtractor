SONS & DAUGHTERS

There’s a place in the city they call the archway
Where we rented three rooms for a dollar a day
And I worked semi-skilled at the capstans for years
And my wife was a good woman but the love disappeared

Sons and daughters, daughters and sons
When a marriage goes down they’re the loneliest ones
Sons and daughters, daughters and sons
How I hope they can cope with the damage I’ve done

I found me a band, I went out on tour
So the kids wouldn’t know I was with them no more
When they said, "where’s me dad? " she’d say, "he’s a star!"
Oh if only stars knew what fools they all are.

Sons and daughters, daughters and sons
When a marriage goes down they’re the loneliest ones
Sons and daughters, daughters and sons
How I hope they can cope with the damage I’ve done

I got a new contract, I got a new life
No more capstans for me and I’ve got a new wife
Sometimes she gets angry, says she wants a family
Then that nightmare returns like a ghost haunting me

Sons and daughters, daughters and sons
When a marriage breaks up you’re the loneliest ones
Sons and daughters, daughters and sons
How I hope you all cope with the damage we done
