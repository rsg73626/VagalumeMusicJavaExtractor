WILD 'N FREE

(Ian Hunter)

Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Oh! I'd never known what it was like to free
I always thought it was never true
I got a feeling I was lost in space
Did not like my face
Just wanted to be
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Like a hurricane
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Oh insanity's so insane 
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
I ain't got no got no got no name
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Don't want no ball and chain

Damn people telling me that I was thinking bad
Had me believing they was right
All they wanted was another slob
In some stinking job
That just ain't me I just want to be
w w w Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Like a hurricane
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Oh insanity's so in so insane 
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
I ain't got no name
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
I don't I don't want to know a ball and chain

Just then I found out I was too broke to get out
So I took to the road no one was having me
I said don't want no handouts
Cause I'm making out
You ain't like me I just want to be
uh uh uh Wild 'N Free 

I tried to tell you babe but you never understood
I always tried to make you see
But you believed just what your old man said
He had you chained to his head
And its on TV TV TV TV
Want to be want to be want to be
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Like a hurricane
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Oh insanity's so insane 
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
I ain't got no got no got no name
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Don't want no ball and chain
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Just like a ball a ball a ball of fire 
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Like it high its getting higher 
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Like some bolt from out the sky
Wild 'N Free Wild 'N Free
Like some bullett
Say goodbye
