THEATRE OF THE ABSURD

(Ian Hunter)

My tea turned seven shades darker
as I sit 'n' write these words
and London's gettin' paler
in my theatre of the absurd.
You figured for an evening
and you made it all worthwile.
It's seldom people have a job
and even rarer that I smile.

Play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Teach your children to be them
and never ever ours.
Play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Someone took the park away
but they left a lonely flower.

And if your songs be classics,
throw them to the hurd.
Truth is where they came from
and not this theatre of the absurd.
Some say you wanted to play for me
but it's only what you've heard
that made you want to capture me
in your theatre of the absurd.
It was not me, I said myself
and you must do so, too.
I hope you have the strength to stay
when I'll be watchin' you.

So baby,
play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Teach your children to be them
and never ever ours.
Play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Someone took the park away
but they left a lonely flower.

Oh when I got here back home tonight
something within me stirred.
Oh it must have been a different kind of play
that touched my theatre of the absurd.
Now I'll be on my way alone
But an interesting thing occurred
See nobody ever shared too much
in my theatre of the absurd.
And there I was back in London,
thought about history.
It was just like being in school again
but I felt something movin' in me.
Hearin' just a bit of the future,
oh it's comin' and it's still blurred
and that's the only thing worth living for
in my theatre of the absurd.

Come on,
play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Teach your children to be them
and never ever ours.
Oh play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Someone took the park away
but they left a lonely flower.

(Beautiful)
Play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
(John, come on)
Play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Oh, play me some, (Come on, Eric) play me some,
play me Brixton power.
Oh, play me some, play me some,
play me Brixton power.
