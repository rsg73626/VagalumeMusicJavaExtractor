MY REVOLUTION

(Casino Steel/Ian Hunter/Dangerfield)

You were just a twinkle in your teenage mother's eyes
I was squeezing Brylcreem on my hair
No one taught us how to be politically correct
And no one told our winkles what to wear

I've been there, I've done it
I've seen it all
That was my contribution oh-oh
So much for the revolution

When someone said, "let's go to bed" nobody was scared
We were up to no good all the time
Judging by those freckles and the shades upon your nose
It's possible you could be one of mine

I've been there, I've done it
I've seen it all
That was my revolution

On the road again, back at number ten
Underneath the lights a thousand and one nights
A revolution for fun
You better lock up your mum

I've been there, I've done it
Well, I've seen them come and go
That's for you to guess and that's for me to know
oh, baby
That's for you to guess and that's for me to know
So much for revolution
So much for revolution
