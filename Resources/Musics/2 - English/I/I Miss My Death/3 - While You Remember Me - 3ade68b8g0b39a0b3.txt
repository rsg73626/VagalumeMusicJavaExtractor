WHILE YOU REMEMBER ME

I touch the dusty pages of my memory
My memoirs light solid pain
My soul is between two elements
Burns with memories
Exhausted by a grief rain

In my dreams we're still together
You don't leave me alone
I cannot express with my feather
How much I still to you belong

Only in my dreams I can touch you
I can look once again in your eyes
But I will not feel your breath
Because it's only illusion of my cries

In my dreams we're still together
You don't leave me alone
I cannot express with my feather
How much I still to you belong

Whatever happens, I'll always be with you
My soul is full of love to you
In your dreams we can always meet at last
And even death's not in forces to separate us

While you remember
While you remember me
WHILE YOU REMEMBER ME

I touch the dusty pages of my memory
My memoirs light solid pain
My soul is between two elements
Burns with memories
Exhausted by a grief rain

In my dreams we're still together
You don't leave me alone
I cannot express with my feather
How much I still to you belong

Only in my dreams I can touch you
I can look once again in your eyes
But I will not feel your breath
Because it's only illusion of my cries

In my dreams we're still together
You don't leave me alone
I cannot express with my feather
How much I still to you belong

Whatever happens, I'll always be with you
My soul is full of love to you
In your dreams we can always meet at last
And even death's not in forces to separate us

While you remember
While you remember me
