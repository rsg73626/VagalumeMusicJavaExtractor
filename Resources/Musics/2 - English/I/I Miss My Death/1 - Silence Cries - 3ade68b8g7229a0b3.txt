SILENCE CRIES

Silence cries
I hear her quite crying
All the world is gradually dying
Everything becomes lifeless, grey

No longer hear raging rivers
Cannot see flowers in the meadows
Only the grey haze around
I only hear a silent cry
Silence cries

Mysterious world
Who is destined to discover it?
Who could know all the charms of life?

In harmony
In love
In love and happiness are hidden
All the answers
Now I only hear the silent cry
Silence cries
