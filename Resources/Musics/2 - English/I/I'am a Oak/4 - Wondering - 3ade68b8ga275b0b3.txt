WONDERING

You'll spent your whole life wondering
What the outcome might have been
When the days are dawning
And I'm not quite feeling it

You'll spent your whole life wondering
What the outcome might have been
Had the step been a half step
Or if that thought was spoken out

To escape and bury
The days within
To escape and bury
The days within

You'll spent your whole life wondering
What the outcome might have been
Let the brook meander
Like it always has
Let the shape be formless
Like it's always been
That's where we'll meet
That's where we'll meet

To escape and bury
The days within
To escape and bury
The days within
