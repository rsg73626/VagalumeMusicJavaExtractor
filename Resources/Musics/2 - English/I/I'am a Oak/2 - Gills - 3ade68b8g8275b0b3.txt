GILLS

They will fall cause the devil's palms
Call its heart's children's dumps
I was born with knuckles
In my head tuning to the streets now

And talking in head concealing the way
Count all the stars, to finisher
Lovely long singstar never sleep
With high time never sleep with high time

They call us heart as gentle star
