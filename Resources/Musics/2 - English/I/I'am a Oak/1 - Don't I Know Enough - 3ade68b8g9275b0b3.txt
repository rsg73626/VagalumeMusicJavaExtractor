DON'T I KNOW ENOUGH

Who had said and who had done?
Who would passed and who has nothing?
Let it be said it was not what is was
It's just resting on my shoulders
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
In the pine there is suddled snakes
Don't I know enough?
Another corn and the wolves are in the yard
Don't I know enough?
Cluddled flock of dangerous thoughts
Don't I know enough?
I wil tire in softly mode
Don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
Hear our voice say, don't I know enough?
