ALWAYS

Always breaking something
Always losing something
I'll figure it out some other day
Cause right now I'm wanting something else
And it means so much more
More to me

I never admit to nothing
I'm too proud to buy my own coffin

I'll figure it out some other day
Cause right now I'm buying something else 
And it means so much more to me

Oh no oh no
Oh no oh no
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh no oh no
Oh no oh no
I wouldn't change a thing

I'll figure it out some other day
Cause right now I'm losing something else 
I'll figure it out some other day
Cause right now I'm buying something else 
And it means so much more to me
