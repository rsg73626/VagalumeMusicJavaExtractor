THIS ONE'S ON ME

Excessive drinking is well in order this evening
Oh, I, I couldn't imagine any other way
We'll raise our glass to those close friends
Who are indisposed
And couldn't make it out
I wonder what that's about?

Drowsy eyes
Man, what do you think?
We have drinks to drink
And now pj's got a tab
You know how that goes, whoa

We eventually take it to the roof
If it had eyes it could right my books about
About the way we acted
Some was charming, some was tragic
It's a perfect night for a talk
Look at the way the city's looking back at us
I wonder if it knows our names?

Drowsy eyes
Man, what do you think?
We have drinks to drink
And now brendan's behind the bar

I haven't been home in six months
Yeah, and I'm leaving in a week
So just stick around
And pick me up when I hit the ground
I don't think you truly understand
You're the reason that I became the man I am
To my friends and family,
This one's on me

Drowsy eyes
Man, what do you think?
We have drinks to drink
When the sun is coming up
Yo man, you think I fucking care?

Well I don't
And I still got some green to smoke
And I got a plan
I wanna wake up every morning in my girl's bed
Yeah, I like to swear I'm big
I don't care about anything
She'll feed me guesses and strong coffee
Until I'm dead
