YOU'VE GOT SPIDERS

Your diary is bleeding
'cause the words are so misleading
The pages run from your every word
'cause they know you lie even to them

Humans learn from their mistakes
Yeah, we all get our breaks
But when it's twenty breaks a day
You don't get them from anybody

I'll recognize those cavernous eyes
I'll pulverize all those tiny lies
You wrap up in a tornado
Of everything I hate
You're the bottom of the plate
You've got spiders

I'll knock on wood for you
And make a call to the higher ups
But there's no way I'm going to where you're going,
Thank you

I'll recognize those cavernous eyes
I'll pulverize all those tiny lies
You wrap up in a tornado
Of everything I hate
You're the bottom of the plate

I'm not waging a war with this
But I'll have pictures to show my kids
And when my friends stop by they'll hug their necks
'cause all daddy's friends lived life with respect
And you've got spiders

I'll recognize those cavernous eyes
I'll pulverize all those tiny lies
You wrap up in a tornado
Of everything I hate
You're the bottom of the plate

I'll recognize those cavernous eyes
I'll pulverize all those tiny lies
You wrap up in a tornado
Of everything I hate
You're everything I hate

Concrete on your feet
Concrete, and you sink to the bottom
