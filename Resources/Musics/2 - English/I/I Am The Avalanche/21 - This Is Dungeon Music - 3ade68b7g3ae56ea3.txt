THIS IS DUNGEON MUSIC

Gettin' real suspicious of the one I love
It's like she's baring down and she's way too close to my back

Call an army marching towards me
Make it fast like a bullet
I want to feel it burn through me

I feel the ground start to shake
And every breath that we take 
Meant so much to me and less to you

Everyone everywhere has their shit and I don't care
I'm merely suggesting to try to think about the mess that you're making

Pick up the garbage 
Cause most of it's yours
Bring the bag outside
Come in before it pours

I feel the ground start to shake
And every breath that we take 
Meant so much to me and less to you
It's like you know things that I'll never know
Well I know I know I know I know I know
I know

Sweetie it's hard for me to stay mad 
sweetie it's hard for me to stay so mad 
Your second chances are just piling up alright

I feel the ground start to shake
And every breath that we take 
Meant so much to me and less to you
It's like you know things that I'll never know
Well I know I know I know I know I know
