BROOKLYN DODGERS

I'll look at a graveyard while I'm in the shower and I,
I'll sing my songs
But not in the morning, when the water is boiling,
Late, late at night, and I'll think to myself

Whatever happened to the Brooklyn Dodgers?
Whatever happened to me?
Whatever happened to all the New York gentlemen?
My daddy said son, you're looking at one.

I mentioned my dad cuz he jokes about the times
That he's had back when he was a hippie,
And how the relatives changed their names
Just to seem more American.

Whatever happened to the Brooklyn Dodgers?
Whatever happened to me?
Whatever happened to all the New York gentlemen?
My daddy he said son, you're looking at one

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, we'll go our own way.
Hey, hey, hey, we'll start today, today

Whatever happened to the Brooklyn Dodgers?
Whatever happened to me?
Whatever happened to all the New York gentlemen?
Do they just float out to sea
Whatever happened to all the New York gentlemen?
My daddy said son, you're looking at one, you're looking at one.
