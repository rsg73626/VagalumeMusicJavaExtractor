AMSTERDAM

To the coffee shop on a rented bike, 8 a.m.
Feeling strangely close to home,
here with my closest friends.

Amsterdam! With a camera in my hand
And a parking cone in the other.
It's times like this mean everything.
Amsterdam I miss you.

When did you grow those giant horns?
Oh I forgot, that the world is upside down.
At least to the rest of us right now.

Amsterdam! With a camera in my hand
And a parking cone in the other.
It's times like this mean everything.
Amsterdam I miss you.

Sunrise, our eyes ever so bright.
Are burning holes in your streets.
Our hearts beat for you.
Your streets,
Our hearts beat for you.

The best part,
Is when we see how far we've come.

Amsterdam! With a camera in my hand
And a parking cone in the other.
It's times like this mean everything.
Amsterdam I miss you.
