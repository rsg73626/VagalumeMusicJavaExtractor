DEAD AND GONE

At the bottom of a swimming pool 
I think I found a clue 
I know 
That I'm getting closer 
I'm looking for fingerprints 
Some sort of documents 
To find the only one who made it all the way from the sun 

She's gone away 
She's gone away 
I need to hear her say 
The world doesn't mean as much as you do 

I can learn the truth 
You see him everyday 
You wish that he was me 
You try to find a way to bring yourself to it 

She's gone away 
She's gone away 
I need to hear her say 
The world doesn't mean as much as you do 
No one means as much as you do 

Hey[x11] 
She's dead and gone away 
Hey[x11] 
She's dead and gone away 

She's gone away 
She's gone away 
I need to hear her say 
The world doesn't mean as much as you do 
No one means as much as you do 

Hey[x3] 
She's dead and gone away 
Hey[x3] 
She's dead and gone away 

At the bottom of a swimming pool 
I think I found a clue 
I know (I know) I know (I know) 
That I'm getting closer 
And you see him everyday 
You wish that he was me 
You try to find a way to bring yourself to it
