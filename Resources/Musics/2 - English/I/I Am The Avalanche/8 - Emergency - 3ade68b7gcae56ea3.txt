EMERGENCY

it was one of those nights,
when you make twenty phone calls
just to stay alive

and you would talk to anyone, anyone
who would possibly
shed some light

so i go to the hospital
to look in to life support
but they don't see a thing
and hurrying me out the door

emergency, such a tragedy
my throat is cut and i'm badly bleeding
my throat is cut and i'm badly bleeding 
emergency, such a tragedy
my lungs are crushed i'm barely breathing, 
my lungs are crushed i'm barely breathing

and since we're both awake
lets sit up and talk about
the last 3 years

she said i guess lets drink this bottle like its medicine to our head
and fall asleep we'll have headaches in the morning
oh I hope i don't overdoes 
on empty promises
and beautiful pictures 
of the one i should've had
i couldn't possibly deal with that

emergency, such a tragedy
my throat is cut and i'm badly bleeding
my throat is cut and i'm badly bleeding 
emergency, such a tragedy
my lungs are crushed i'm barely breathing, 
my lungs are crushed i'm barely breathing
give me something,
yeah give me anything,
just to get me through the night
just to get me through the night
somebody help me

emergency, such a tragedy
my throat is cut and i'm badly bleeding
my throat is cut and i'm badly bleeding 
emergency, such a tragedy
my lungs are crushed i'm barely breathing, 
my lungs are crushed i'm barely breathing

somebody help me,
cause this is an emergency
