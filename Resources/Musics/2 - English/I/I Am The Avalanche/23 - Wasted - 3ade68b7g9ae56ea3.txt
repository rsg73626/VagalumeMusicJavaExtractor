WASTED

I finally found a way
To make it go away
Make all the things I say be cleverly stated
And I move away from here
And hardly ever turn my back 
That works for miles and miles cause I'm wasted

Maybe I 
Baby I lied
But I'm much bigger than that now

I'm waking to your knees shaking 
The whole towns quaking from the love we've been making
I learn to forget 
It's so hard to forget 
Like when that hair was wet(it's so hard to forget)

Maybe I 
Oh baby I lied
But I'm much bigger than that now
I'm wasted
And she's wasted
She's wasted

Maybe I
Oh baby I lied
But I'm much bigger than that now

No one cares 
See the damage that we did 
Are we much bigger than that now?
Are we much bigger than that now?
Are we much bigger than that now?
cause I'm much bigger than that now
I'm much bigger than that now
