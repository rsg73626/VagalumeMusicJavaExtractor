I'LL BE BACK AROUND

I grind my teeth to dust
When I'm walking in my sleep
And with any luck I'll walk all night
And end up at your feet

(free from all) anxiety and panic
(wash away) and let the city have it
And just get some sleep tonight
'cause you're by my side
And we're still alive tonight

One day we'll be perfect
One day we'll all sleep safe and sound
I swear on my eyes I'll be back around
When I'm so down

One day there will be no pills
Or hospital visits
And we'll take back our lives
You'll take it back tonight

One day we'll be perfect
One day we'll all sleep safe and sound
I swear on my eyes I'll be back around

Believe me
One day we'll all sleep safe and sound
I swear on my eyes I'll be back around
I'll be back around

I swear on my eyes I'll be back around
I swear we'll sleep safe and sound
I swear on my eyes I'll be back around
And when it all comes down
I'm gonna survive, I'll be back around
When I'm so down
