HOLY FUCK

So I'm alone for the first time in five years,
Holy fuck, things have changed.
I'm happy to see you can live without me.
I've sorted out my life, my tragic life.

Don't pat yourself on the back yet.
Just shut your mouth and pay your rent.
And make a record they'll never forget.
I care too much, too much to leave.
You don't turn your back on family.

Besides, how could I ever look you in the eye 
Without knowing that I tried?
Thank god it wasn't winter when all this me and you 
Shit hit the fan.

The sun, the streets, 
the records I bought were my crutches again and again.
Don't pat yourself on the back yet.
Just shut your mouth and pay your rent.

This is a year that you'll never forget.
Change is something I accept,
But I can't accept a stranger in you so please make this a dream.
