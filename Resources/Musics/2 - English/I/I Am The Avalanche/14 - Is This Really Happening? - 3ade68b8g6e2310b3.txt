IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

She's a golden ticket
A shining peach mixed in a drink
That's resting on a chair in a desert land
And not a grain of sand has compromised her worth
And you're a broken man
Crawling on his hands and knees
In that same desert land
Doing the best he can not to think about 
how he really needs that drink
Is this really...

Is this really happening?
The sun's finally shining down on me
Is this really happening
The snow's actually meting in front of my face

I don't know but I've been told
That a New York winter is mighty cold
Yeah, but we still walk down the coldest blocks 
using the fire in our hearts
The way it wasn't, the way it is that works perfectly for me
So let's keep it that way
Is this really...

Is this really happening?
The sun's finally shining down on me
Is this really happening
The snow's actually meting in front of my face [2x]

This perfectly perfect disease has got me down on my knees
No not to pray but just to say
I love you more than yesterday
