DEAD FRIENDS

Here it is
It's the letter you wrote
The night before you died
Just so we would all know
That it was not all good
In fact, the bottom dropped out
Oh, katie, my love,
There's nothing we can do now

There was no one around
Only strangers and sort-of friends
And you were bummed on the news
That they had met without you
They're sick of you being sick of yourself

Katie, you carry the weight of the world
I carry some weight myself
You carry the weight of the world
It's dying in your arms again

Rewind the tapes and the years
Back to punk shows and diner food
Now nofx is in town
And you're not in the mood
I'm sick of you being sick of yourself

Katie, you carry the weight of the world
I carry some weight myself
You carry the weight of the world
It's dying in your arms again

You don't love anything anymore
We've been worried sick for you
And it's time you came back home

Katie, you carry the weight of the world
I carry some weight myself
You carry the weight of the world
It's dying in your arms

Oh, katie, you carry the weight of the world
I carry some weight myself
You carry the weight

Here it is
It's the letter you wrote
Oh, katie, my love
There's nothing we can do now
