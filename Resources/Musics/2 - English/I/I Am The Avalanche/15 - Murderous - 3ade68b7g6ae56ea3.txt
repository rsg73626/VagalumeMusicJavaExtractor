MURDEROUS

Can't take it from me 
You can't take it from me
No My cold dead hands are much stronger now

And no I can't figure out what the fuck I'm still doing here
So many places I can be 

and I'm just killing time yeah before it kills me 
Come on at least its a clever way to be

Get down
Stay down 
It's too big a hole to be digging out 
To high to see the world you hate and
You're so murderous (murderous)
So murderous

Hold on just listen
No wait please listen to the sound seems like it's way closer now
High up on a cloud seems like the worst part's coming down it's coming down

And I'm just killing time yeah before it kills me 
Come on at least its an honest way to be

Get down 
Stay down 
It's too big a hole to be digging out 
To high to see the world you hate and
You're so murderous (murderous)
So murderous (murderous)
You're so murderous (murderous)
So murderous

What better way to make yourself look good than the first time
Yeah than the first time
What better way to make yourself feel good than the second time
Yeah than the second time
What better way, what better way

You're so murderous (murderous)
So murderous (murderous)
You're so murderous (murderous)
So murderous (murderous)
You're so murderous (murderous)
So murderous (murderous)
Murderous (murderous)
You're so
