GRATITUDE

Gratitude for the broken teeth
And broken hearts you stood and saw me through
Let me know if there's anything I can do

Everywhere I go,
I walk with all the strength you gave to me
And everything I do
I do with all the love you showed me

Gratitude for the sleepless nights
The lows and highs
Your voice kept me alive

So when the mountains fall
I'll be there at your side

And you know when it's time
For that giant wave to take the earth back
And was us away
You'll have my hand
And you always will.
