GREEN EYES

When she called my sneakers tennis shoes
I knew she was from the west coast
Or the best coast
Like she'd say and I had to disagree

I fell in love with a ship
A vessel with at least 20 holes
Yeah but she still floats
I fell in love with the sea 
A brilliant tidal wave
She devastated me

Come back home
And bring those green eyes
Oh when are you coming home?

I fell in love with a queen, a king
She burnt my village down
I paid her with love and taxes
I fell in love with a street sign that told me where to go
Oh why do I go anywhere?

Come back home
And bring those green eyes
When are you coming home?
Get back here 
Cause baby these blue eyes
Are never as bright without you

And when you called me from San Francisco
I knew you had started a new life
Yeah without me
You're only you

Come back home
And bring those green eyes
Oh when are you coming home?
Get back here 
Cause baby these blue eyes 
Are never as bright without you
When are you coming home?
When are you coming home?
when are you coming home?
when are you coming home?
