I TOOK A BEATING

I took a beating in 2003
At least I improved
My threshold for pain

See my eyes swelled up and poured out blood
He spent six months just cleaning it up
The doctor said he'd stitch up the cut for me
My next beating's in two weeks

I've been taking a beating, in 2004
yeah only two months have passed by
I'm already on the floor

I took a baseball bat straight to the knees
I buckled over in the cold Brooklyn street
The same doctor helped me back to my feet
He said to me "I'll see you in two weeks"

And if I take a beating (beating) in 2005 (beating)
It'll be a miracle (beating)
If I'm still alive (beating)
