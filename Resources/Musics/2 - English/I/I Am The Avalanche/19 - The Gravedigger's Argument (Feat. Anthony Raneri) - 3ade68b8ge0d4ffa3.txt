THE GRAVEDIGGER'S ARGUMENT (FEAT. ANTHONY RANERI)

So I said,
"you think you're gonna get away with this?"
You said, "I don't want to have
This fucking conversation right now"

Digging a ditch tonight
In my backyard
Six feet of dirt between
You and the snow

So you said,
"you haven't changed enough and I've changed a bit"
I said "why I always have to be
The one who's wide awake and you're fast asleep"

Digging a ditch tonight
In my backyard
Six feet of dirt between
You and the snow

I won't be done with you, yeah, until
You're in a grave
Oh, what a fucking shame
Yeah, if that's what it would take

Fucking leave
And don't forget to leave your front door key
And after that, you can find your own way,
Find your own way back

Digging a ditch tonight
In my backyard
Six feet of dirt between
You and the
Go, stop
