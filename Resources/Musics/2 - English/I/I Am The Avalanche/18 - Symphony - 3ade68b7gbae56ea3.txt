SYMPHONY

You're a gallon away,
from drowning yourself
but I don’t mind,
it's what makes you, you

You're a flames lick away,
from burning yourself
were not scared
cause you always bounce back, yeah so

Promise me, if we both die violently
that the blood dripping from our chin
is a symphony

And I’m a mile away,
from never turning around
and living my life, rolling on gas fumes

And I’m a second away
from the record time
four days spent,
waiting in line, yeah so

Bury me, with my giant screen TV
it's the only thing, 
that’s been faithful to me

Ryan smokes these days,
and Kev sleeps till four
and bobs still superman, climbing buildings whoa oh oh

And Ryan shaved his beard,
and Kev shaved his too,
and bobs still on his phone, oh

Promise me, if we both die violently
that the blood dripping from our chin
is a symphony
and promise me, if we both live
in infamy, that our statues will cast
a shadow on our city
