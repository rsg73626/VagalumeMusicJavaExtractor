CLEAN UP

Clean up next day
From the tickertape parade that you threw for me
I thought I earned half heartedly
But we both know I don't deserve a thing

Spill out my chest
On to paper for a check
That we cashed too soon
And now the government is on my stoop
Awaiting documents and beating down my door

Everyone is sleeping and everyone is sad
And everything is perfect, perfect wasn't bad

Jesus Christ I need you
I need you now
Or anyone who feels like helping out
Jesus Christ I need you 
I need you now
Or anyone who feels like helping out

[Jupara]
