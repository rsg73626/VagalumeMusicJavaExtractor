MY SECOND RESTRAINING ORDER

a week a week you've been sleeping for a week
yeah but does he know does he know does he know
don’t worry cause i’m sure he'll get a copy
of the list of times I saved your life

i know exactly where i want to be
i know exactly where i want to be
in your bed, lying dead
will that get your attention baby!?

a week a week you've been asleep for a few days now
and do ya do ya know do ya know do ya know that I’ve been here everyday
watching you, what you do, scrap the plan, 
get my senses, grab my bag and climb out the window

i know exactly where i want to be
i know exactly where i want to be
in your bed, lying dead
will that get your attention sweetie!?

fresh cut wrists and still clenched fists
am i messing up your sheets
well i'll be gone soon

you left, you left me hanging like a noose
you left, you left me hanging like a noose
you left, you left me hanging like a noose
you left, you left

in your bed, lying dead
will that get your attention asshole!?

fresh cut wrists and still clenched fists
am i messing up your sheets
well i'll be gone soon
i'll be gone soon, soon enough
yeah i'll be gone soon
i'll be gone soon, soon enough
ohhhhh
