LOST GRAVITY

Can you feel the pressure it's getting harder to breathe
The earth is shaking
And the ground starts breaking down
Let's find each other so we can be together
When this thing ends

They say we are spinning faster now
A shift in the earth has taken us off course
I don't think we could save ourselves now
Remember the beginning, but let's embrace the end

Things start floating
Find something to hold on to
To hold on to

We will all fall into the sky
'Cause we have lost gravity
There's nothing to hold us down
So let's just let go

Hold on as things start to float around
Tie yourself down
To buy some time until I get to you
But you say I don't want to see you
Cause I don't want to see you go
