AS MY HEART EXPLODES

I was so strong, so indestructible.
But I guess I was wrong.
I thought I was bulletproof, until you came along.
I used to throw away everything
Until I heard you say..

"take this light and hold it, close to you"
She said "think of me, when there is darkness inside of you."

Out of the cold
Started to feel something new, with you
Had something to hold, it was warm and new.
I used to throw away everything until I heard you say

"take this light and hold it, close to you"
She said "think of me, when there is darkness inside of you."

So watch as my heart explodes in front of you.
A million pieces of me are flying towards you.
Please cover your face I don't want this to hurt you.
And I believe that I can see through you.
I believe that I am free from you.

The colors have changed,
And its getting dark but the light inside had started
To fade until I hear you say.
"take this light and hold it close to you"
She said "think of me, when there is darkness inside of you".

I saw you
I saw you.. standing there.
Who was the one holding your hand?
Who was the one, standing where you stand?
So I just walked away and I didn't say a word.
Till you saw me, looking back at you.
We both just stood and stared
And then I closed my eyes.

So watch as my heart explodes in front of you.
A million pieces of me are flying towards you
Please cover your face I don't want this to hurt you
And I believe that I can through you
I believe that I am free from you.
