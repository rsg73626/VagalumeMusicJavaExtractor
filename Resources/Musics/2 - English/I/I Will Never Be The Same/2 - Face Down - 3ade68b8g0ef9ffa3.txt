FACE DOWN

You were the first to go.
Now I'm watching the distance between us grow.
In focus to a blur,
It was real but you weren't really sure.
You said this was impossible
And I guess I should I have listened,
So its time I really say goodbye.

This will all fade down and drown the things
That I love the most, we should all stay away
From everyone and everything we love
Because we can't just let go.

The less you know, the less it might hurt you.
The more I stay, is the more pain that wont go away
I wish I never came here and I wish this never happened
Cause all im gonna to do is let you down.

This will all fade down and drown the things
That I love the most, we should all stay away
From everyone and everything we love
Because we cant just let go.

Fade down?.fade away

This will all fade down and drown the things
That I love the most, we should all stay away
From everyone and everything we love
Because we cant just let go.

Fade down... fade away
