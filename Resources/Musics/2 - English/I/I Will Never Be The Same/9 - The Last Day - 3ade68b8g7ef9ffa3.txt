THE LAST DAY

I can feel you
The warmth of you
Passing through
Every point
But as you start
To pull away
The cold rushes in
And my heart
Starts to beat again
To try and help me to survive

Cause this is our last day
Until we all fall apart
Time to find a new way out

It all seems so clear
Now I cant see were we'll be

As this disappears.

Can we start again
Lets fade to black
Turn the lights down
And hold my hand and just
Let go.

Start to feel our souls
In control, face to face
To fall in love, our souls combine

'cause this is our last day
Until we all fall apart
Time to find a new way out
It all seems so clear
Now I cant see were we'll be
I hope I dont forget you
As this disappears.
