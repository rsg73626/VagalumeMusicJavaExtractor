TORNADOES

I am here to destroy you
And take everything away
I am here to show you that
This is just the beginning of everything
That you never knew, so run.

Feel that life cant go on
Letting go of what you wanted. fall into flames.
I believed it was all, in my head
Until I was stripped away all the things that I cared for.
Hold on to life, this is the impact you leave.

All of the sudden
You turned cold and still
The sky started to change into you.
I walked away and towards you.

I tore this all down
What I built and what I knew were in pieces.
Everything is broken and splintered
So just close your eyes and hold on tight
And I wont let go.

Feel that life cant go on
Letting go of what you wanted. fall into flames.
I believed it was all, in my head
Until I was stripped away all the things that I cared for.
Hold on to life, this is the impact you leave.

Some day I will find my way out of here
And I will come save you.
Someway I will find that things that do
That make me want to destroy you.
