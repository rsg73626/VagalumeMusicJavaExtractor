SKYHUNTER

The strangers
Have fallen from the sky
They have hunted
And torn apart our cities
The fires from our souls
Are burning out of control
They are not
Who we thought they were

We must leave now
Venture from the city lights
As we drive through the dark
To find a safer place to hide away
It starts falling down
I can feel the fear in your eyes
Try not breathe any in
We must get away

These are the risks that you have to take
Wake up
The are feelings that you have to break
So wake up
You and I must try
To survive
You and I must fight for our lives

There was a flash
Way off in the distance
I lower my head
And close my eyes
Maybe they have won
We've been defeated
We are all alone now

The ground starts to shake
As I hear them come
We better move
We better start
To run
Run

These are the risks that you have to take
So wake up
The are feelings that you have to break
So wake up
You and I must try
To survive
You and I must fight for our lives
