FALL APART

Don't let them tear you down,
You are wearing thin.
Don't let them stare you down,
Don't let them in.
Just be strong don't let them win
But if you lose, just get back up again

Sometimes things fall apart
Just stand up and return to the start

All of the dreams that faded away,
All of the lives that you couldn't save,
All of the hearts that are filled with pain,
All of the love that you let slip away, let it slip away.

You gotta just stand up
And start again
Push forward
Harder than anything that you ever believed in
Hold tight and stand your ground
Don't let them push you down.

Sometimes things fall apart
Just stand up and return to the start

All of the dreams that faded away,
All of the lives that you couldn't save,
All of the hearts that are filled with pain,
All of the love that you let slip away,
Let it slip away.
