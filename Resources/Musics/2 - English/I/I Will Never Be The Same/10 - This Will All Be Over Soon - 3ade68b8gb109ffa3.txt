THIS WILL ALL BE OVER SOON

And I can't stand to see the way we were
When I look at your photographs
And now I'm alone
It's blown my mind
I didn't want to give up on you
I hope all your faces will fade away
I'm falling out of time with you
And some day I will hold you close again
And I won't let you go

'Cause this will only break your heart
This will all be over soon
I won't let you lose control
I will always be here before you know

And I have found the fountain of truth
Where the water is cold just like you
And I jump in and take a deep breath
And fall on my knees
Slowly, start to freeze
When I'm fighting all your low degrees
Just feel weak and believe
That I'm falling into you

'Cause this will only break your heart
This will all be over soon
I won't let you lose control
I will always be here before you know
Before you know

So please don't go
I can't pull you through if you lock me inside of you
