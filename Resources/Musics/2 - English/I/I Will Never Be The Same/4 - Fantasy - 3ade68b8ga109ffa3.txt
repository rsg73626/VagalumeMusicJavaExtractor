FANTASY

My god you are so fucking pretty
I want to give you everything that I can
You say you can do whatever you want right now

And I say don't come in closer
I just want you to be my fantasy
Don't come in closer
I just want you to be my fantasy

Come over here and let me whisper in your ear
What I want to do to you
I want to tell you what the hell you should be doing now
Come follow me

Don't come in closer
I just want you to be my fantasy

I want to turn around
I want to steal you now
I want to make you and by its not the right time
I know where you will be
Where I can always see
You are the sum of me
