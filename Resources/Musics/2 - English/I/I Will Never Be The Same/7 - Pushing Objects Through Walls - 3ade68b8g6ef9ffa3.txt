PUSHING OBJECTS THROUGH WALLS

Slowly pushing
Objects through walls
Answering the phone before
Someone calls
The lights wont turn on
You are there I can feel it.

So I move closer
And I can hear your heart start to beat.

Cant tell if this is real,
Maybe we all should run?
No one is left alive
Am I the only one?

Please dont wake me up
Before I get to touch you.
I am in the dark
But somehow I can feel you
I can hear breathe so
I move closer and I can hear your
Heart start to beat.

Cant tell if this is real,
Maybe we all should run?
No one is left alive
Am I the only one?

This thing inside
Will never die
No matter how much
You try

So just
Close your eyes and let it inside
Cause this dream was real.
