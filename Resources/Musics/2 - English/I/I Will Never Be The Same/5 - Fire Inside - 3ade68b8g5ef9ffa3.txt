FIRE INSIDE

I am wishing you
Could come over
To my place
I want your kiss and your sweat
Something you will never forget

The only thing I want to do is look
In your eyes
And be the fire inside of you

So give it up
You'll save yourself
But you will never know
What it really it feels like
When I give it to you.

I know you think this is love
So lets just skip the kiss
And go for it.

The only thing I want to do
Is look in your eyes
And be the fire inside of you

Turn off the lights
And close your eyes
Can you feel the heat
From my heart beat
As I touch your soul
With full control
I take you over

I will take you in
I will show you
Everything
Is all right now
I will show you everything
And I will take you everywhere
If you just let me in.

The only thing I want to do
Is look in your eyes
And be the fire inside of you
