JOHN HUGHES

How long's it been since I was young?
Fifteen years since wooden guns
Six years since playing board games
was anywhere near fun
And it'd be over-dramatic to say
the world'll forget about me on its way
But that's not always enough
to keep cursing the whole of the earth at bay

No one knows me like john hughes did
I think we all relate to that
Because we've all felt unsung
From every mouth and every lung
We've all felt that life was easier when we were young
How long's it been since 'overwhelmed'
was still a word I couldn't spell
Let alone the most obvious choice for a word
to define myself?
I never thought I'd be this young a man
to be doubting the cards in these hands
That jitter and shake half the time
from the coffee I drink and rely on to stand

No one knows me like john hughes did
I think we all relate to that
Because we've all felt unsung
from every mouth and every lung
We've all felt that life was easier when we were young
Because we've all felt unsung
from every mouth and every lung
We've all felt that life was easier when we were young

There'll be days when we lose our way like a feather
(What are we destined for?)
But we all live and we die in this cold, cold world together
(What are we destined for?)
What are we destined for?
No one knows me like john hughes did
(Cause we've all felt)
No one knows me like john hughes did
(Unsung from every mouth and every lung)

We've all felt
(No one knows me like john hughes did)
That life was easier when we were young
We've all felt unsung from every mouth and every lung
(No one knows me like john hughes did)
Cause we've all felt
(No one knows me like john hughes did)
That life was easier when we were young
