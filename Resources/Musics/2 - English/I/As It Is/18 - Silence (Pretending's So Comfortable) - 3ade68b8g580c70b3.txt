SILENCE (PRETENDING'S SO COMFORTABLE)

Four walls and a door
We used to call home
The rest of our lives but not enough time till we're both alone
I try to steady my hands
You hurt to know why
I open my mouth and just trip over sounds
But my eyes speak goodbye
The silence tells us all we need to know


I breathe nervous and slow
Well your desperate for air
My eyes sink to the floor
Yours go bounce down the stair
In my tears you know I meant all I said
As every elegant word I said sinks in again


The silence tells us all we need to know (need to know)
Pretending's so comfortable
But I have to go for the last time


You challenge all that I think
Something is what made me it
I rephrase and repeat
Leaving nothing unsaid
Your hysterics aren't the last words you'd hear
As I stand to the your moment
Your four walls full of fear


The silence tells us all we need to know (need to know)
Pretending's so comfortable
But I have to go for the last time


We won't talk at all, we'll just wonder
We won't talk at all, we'll just wonder
We won't talk at all, we'll just wonder
We won't talk at all, we won't talk at all
We won't just talk at all, we'll just wonder what we still swallow when we shouldn't
We won't just talk at all, we'll just wonder what we still swallow when we shouldn't


The silence tells us all we need to know (need to know)
Pretending's so comfortable
But I have to go for the last time
The silence tells us all we need to know (need to know)
Pretending's so comfortable
But I had to go
