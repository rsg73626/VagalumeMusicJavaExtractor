JANUARY

We saw our breath under the streetlights
on the coastline
But we were warm with cheap coats
on and the glow in our eyes
Anybody with half their mind would've kept warm inside
But we're young and have a point to prove
let's do this in style

There's half a trillion pebbles on Brighton beach
And tonight they are the stage on which we sing
We will all sing

Yeah, it's freezing outside, but fuck it, we don't mind

It's been seven hours
since they switched the lights off on the pier
But we've been doing alright
with the starlight as our chandelier

We met the waves at the edge of the sea
And staring out into the water, we will sing
We will all sing

The bitter cold cuts like a knife on January nights
Nothing has a value when all time is in suspension
So in this moment
we're historic and rich with good intentions
