HOROSCOPES

There's no God if this is all there is for me
A temper and conceptions that I'm lonely
When death comes, I'll be ready
But I'll waste my life preparing
There's so much more to life than breathing

I see life through a dog's eyes
A world in black and white
A world that would so happily forget me
I'm faithless I'm shameless
I just wanna believe in something
But I think that horoscopes are bullshit
I just wanna believe in something
Anything at all, yeah

I'm faithless I'm shameless
I make terrible decisions
And I pay for them in the fear
That keeps my eyes glued to the ceiling
If I drown, will you drown with me?
'Cause I'd hate to leave you lonely
In a world that would so happily forget me

I'm faithless I'm shameless
I just wanna believe in something
But I think that horoscopes are bullshit
I just wanna believe in something
Anything at all, yeah

All great men die young
Just bodies in boxes or dust in porcelain and
Once my friends are gone
I'll remember when we held the world with our fingers
All great men die young
Just bodies in boxes or dust in porcelain
All great men die young
And I'm so fucking scared to outlive all I've ever known
I just wanna believe in something
