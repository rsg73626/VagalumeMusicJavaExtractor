RELIVE THE STORY

I've grown out of hope
I'm giving up on living up to my expectations
'Cause I'm the kind of kid who'd abandoned ship
Not go down with it
'Cause it always seems I'm in a house of mirrors
When I can barely look at myself
No. I can barely look at myself... Anymore

I don't have the strength to carry on
There's nothing left for me, I'm too far gone
I don't know where I was led wrong
This is not the place where I belong
I don't know where my plans have gone
I'll make this up as I go along
I don't have the strength to carry on... Anymore

I'll take it all out on myself
'Cause I can't break what's already broken
Yeah the structure's fine, but this mind of mine
Runs read all the time
I wonder if the air hates that its touched me
When I step out and enter the world
'Cause I don't wanna enter the world... Anymore
There's nothing left for me, I'm too far gone
I'll never be the man that I want to be
And he'd never wanna be me

I'll never be the man that I want to be
And he'd never wanna be me
So I'll fake a smile and lie to who knows at me
I tried but now I'm done with the world
No I don't wanna homour the world... Anymore
I've accomplished nothing except knowing
How to fall in love all alone
I'll never be the man that I want to be

And he'd never wanna be me
I'll never be the man that I want to be
And he'd never wanna be me
I'll never be the man that I want to be
And he'd never wanna be me
I'll never be the man that I want to be
And he'd never wanna be me
