TURN BACK TO ME

The memories are still so bright
but I keep the curtains drawn
I've never been like this
Or am I just, romanticizing a person that's gone


I can only take so much before I spill my guts
But I'm terrified of letting you see what I'm thinking
But you left before I could
And if I could choose, I would
Cause my mind's a frightening and lonely place
I can't escape at night


You dropped yourself away
Time makes your dreams come true
I hoped that you would stay
Miles mean nothing to you (come back to me)
It's all my fault and I know it (come back to me)
It's all my fault and I know it


I know that I deserve to be alone
I wrote myself out of your story
And I know I made it seem like I never cared at all
but I swear
I was always trying


This was hard when you were still around
(you were still around)
How am I meant to survive this now (survive this now)
I'm so disappointed in who I chose to be (who I chose to be)
I've been having nightmares that follow me until I fall asleep


You dropped yourself away
Time makes your dreams come true
I hoped that you would stay
Miles mean nothing to you (come back to me)
It's all my fault and I know it (come back to me)
It's all my fault and I know it
It's all my fault and I know it x6
