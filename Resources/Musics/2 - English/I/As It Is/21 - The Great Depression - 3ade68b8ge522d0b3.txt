THE GREAT DEPRESSION

Hello consumer
I know you're there
So let me sing you this new dose of lies we've carefully prepared
Hello consumer
Just close your eyes
Listen close enough and this song might just save your fucking life

We live in The Great Depression
This is how we sell our lies

I'm the poet and the problem
I'm the blade and I'm the stitch
We tell you it's okay to die to stop you giving in
I'm the poet and the problem
I'm the sickness and the cure
We tell you what you wanna hear cause we're so insecure

You think you know me
When I feel down
Another song's another reason I'll just leave you here to drown
Call me dishonest
Call me a fraud
But you've been saying that for years and that's what got us where we are

We live in The Great Depression
This is how we sell our lies

I'm the poet and the problem
I'm the blade and I'm the stitch
We tell you it's okay to die to stop you giving in
I'm the poet and the problem
I'm the sickness and the cure
We tell you what you wanna hear cause we're so insecure
(We're so insecure)
