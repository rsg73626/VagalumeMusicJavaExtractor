BITTER, BROKEN ME

Tell me again
Tell me every way I failed you
Tell me everything
Everything you think but never dare to speak
Compared to you, I'm a statue
That everyone sees through
If no one else would miss me
Then I'd like to think you would

This dependency
Will shatter me
Bitter, broken me
If you're the rain
Then I'm a window pane
The one you'll touch before (touch before)
You leave another day

You kill me
I'll reconstruct myself to love your pain
I'm screaming at myself
'Cause I can't bring myself to scream your name
If I'm insane
Then you're the same
A hopeless case
I'm still the skin you shed
The fact you read
I'm just the way you found me

This dependency
Will shatter me
Bitter, broken me
If you're the rain
I'm a window pane
The one you'll touch before (touch before)
You leave another day

You're ever so sweet
You're everything I know I don't deserve at all
You're ever so sweet
You're everything I dream about and live another day for

I'd like to think
That you
That you would miss me
I'd like to think
You're my favourite lie

This dependency
Will shatter me
Bitter, broken me
If you're the rain
I'm a window pane
The one you'll touch before
You leave another day
