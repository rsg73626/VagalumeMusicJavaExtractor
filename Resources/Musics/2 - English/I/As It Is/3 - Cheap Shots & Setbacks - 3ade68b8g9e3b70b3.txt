CHEAP SHOTS & SETBACKS

You've got everything to look up to from the bottom
You've got everyone else to compare yourself against
So forget it, you're forgotten in a world so disenchanted
Always asking, never knowing
Is it just you or everybody else?

We're the kids who are dead inside
But we're the ones who feel alive
We dream cause we don't sleep
We'll never get rest, but we got this

It hurts, and they like that
They fight fire with cheap shots and setbacks
They take cloudless thoughts and pristine hearts for granted
So forget them, they've forgotten you already
You can't help, can't help but ask yourself
"Is it just me or everybody else? "

We're the kids who are dead inside
But we're the ones who feel alive
We dream cause we don't sleep
We'll never get rest, but we got this

I don't need your cheap shots and setbacks
I'm fucking fine so go and take them all back
I don't need your cheap shots and setbacks

We're the kids who are dead inside
But we're the ones who feel alive
We dream cause we don't sleep
We'll never get rest, but we got this
