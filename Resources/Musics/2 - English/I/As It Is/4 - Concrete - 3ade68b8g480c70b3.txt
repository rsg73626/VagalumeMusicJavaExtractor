CONCRETE

You don't say what you mean
When you say I'm what you need
You tell white lies from your heart of gold
I'm not the place you want to be
I'm just the places in between
I feel complete but uncomfortable
I get distracted by the greener grass
But I always find it blankets paths of broken glass
I tell myself that I'll find my way back home
But getting lost is so easy on your own


My concrete's set, it's permanent
I'm stuck this way, now I can never change
No, I can't stop if all I've got
Is an empty heart full of broken parts


I don't say what I mean
I can't give you everything
I'm as stubborn as cynical
It takes more than love to keep you smiling
More than hope to keep you trying
It's hard to be inseparable
When we have separate principles


My concrete's set, it's permanent
I'm stuck this way, now I can never change
No, I can't stop if all I've got
Is an empty heart full of broken parts


I'm too far gone to change for anyone
I'm too far gone to change for anyone
I'm too far gone to change for anyone
I'm too far gone to change


My concrete's set, it's permanent
I'm stuck this way, now I can never change
No, I can't stop if all I've got
Is an empty heart full of broken parts


My concrete's set, it's permanent
I'm stuck this way, now I can never change
No, I can't stop if all I've got
Is an empty heart full of broken parts
