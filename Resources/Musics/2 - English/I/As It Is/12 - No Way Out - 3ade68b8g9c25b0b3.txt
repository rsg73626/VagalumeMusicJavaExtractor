NO WAY OUT

Inside as the rain came pouring down
It can't wash away all this hurt that haunts me now
Inside as the rain came pouring down
I'm losing touch with the only soul I've found
Desperate delusions are all I have
Just to keep me hanging on

I shut my eyes, but my world's still burning
I can't escape, I feel it killing me
No way out
Here I am again
I shut my eyes, but my world's still burning
I can't escape, I feel it killing me
No way out
Here I am again

Choked up, but the pain came after all
I feel displaced in these once familiar walls
Patient I fall with no end in sight
And the noose around my neck

I shut my eyes, but my world's still burning
I can't escape, I feel it killing me
No way out
Here I am again
I shut my eyes, but my world's still burning
I can't escape, I feel it killing me
No way out
Here I am again

And as I let hindsight translate nightmares into reality
I begin to see myself for who I truly was
Somebody desperate
Somebody entirely out of their depth
Somebody beyond their abilities to cope
And as I exhale out the pain
I'm digesting the severity of the depression I felt
The extent to which it claimed a piece of me
How it's left me emotionally vacant and painfully numb
And now together
My faults and my thoughts prey on me like vultures
Creeping from their comfortable distance
Never once exiting my line of vision
And the facade I invite to amble whilst wearing my skin
He isn't me and he never will be me
And I know that I fucked up
But I want to grow from it

I shut my eyes, but my world's still burning
I can't escape, I feel it killing me
No way out
Here I am again
I find myself in the same dark ending
I can't escape, I feel it killing me
No way out
Here I am again
No way out
Here I am again
