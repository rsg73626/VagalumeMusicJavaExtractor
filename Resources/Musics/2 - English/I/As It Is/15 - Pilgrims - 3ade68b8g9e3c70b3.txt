PILGRIMS

My early memories only come in handfuls
And those that follow span a decade uneventful
They live in vcrs that play my scrapes
And scars on a screen for all
'Cause I was never one to look at them as anchors
But something lighter like a souvenir or postcard
I packed them up to drive and carry
On 'til I called a new town home

I wanted more for myself than seeing
Life in the shade of this town
To always follow footsteps that never
Left I wanted more for myself
Just because I've got my head in the clouds
Doesn't mean that my feet are off the ground
And if we're meant for things, then maybe I'm meant to be here

I've got my head in the clouds
I've got my feet on the ground
And if we're meant for things
Then maybe I'm meant to be here
I carried on to drive and called a new town home
