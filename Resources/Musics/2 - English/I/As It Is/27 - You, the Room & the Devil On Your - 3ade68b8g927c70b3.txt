YOU, THE ROOM & THE DEVIL ON YOUR

Take care of yourself
But carry the whole world
Just forget that it hurts
From ankle to collarbone
And you think
And you bury your head away
And you sink

It's just you, the room, and the devil on your shoulder

Take care of yourself
But you wish you were like them
So calm and assured
Emotionally colorful
You're a fake
As soon as the door closes, you break

It's just you, the room, and the devil on your shoulder

Take care of yourself
But you're nothing but trouble
Just the damage of thought
You'll never recover from
How you love
A world you're only dreaming of

It's just you, the room, and the devil on your shoulder
