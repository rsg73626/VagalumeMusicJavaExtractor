SORRY

Fix me, I'm defective
Stitch me up and make me feel new again
Take all that's wrong and correct it
Leave nothing that resembles this mess that I am

I miss what never was with us
Our fiction I constructed
You're everywhere and all that I think about
I can't even feel alone in my own head

On my own again
I'm trying not to feel
'Cause I'm feeling like the world forgot me
On my own again
Yeah, you were always his
And all I ever was was sorry

I'm my own invention
An unfulfilled and underwhelmed work of art
I'm desperate for your affection
It's hopeless, I know, but that's just who I am
It's like my mind has mirrored walls
And you're standing in the middle
I'm equal parts self-doubt and confidence
And I'm confident I'll die with every word I have left unsaid

On my own again
I'm trying not to feel
'Cause I'm feeling like the world forgot me
On my own again
Yeah, you were always his
And all I ever was was sorry

On my own again
I'm trying not to feel
'Cause I'm feeling like the world forgot me
On my own again
Yeah, you were always his
And all I ever was was sorry

I'm just a reader, you're every chapter
Never happy, ever after
I'm just a reader, you're every chapter
Never happy, ever after
On my own again
Never happy, ever after
On my own again
Never happy, ever after
