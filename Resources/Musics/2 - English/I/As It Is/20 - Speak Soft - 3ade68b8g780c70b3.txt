SPEAK SOFT

Why should I stick around
When all I do is let you down?

Can I ask you a question?
When you see my reflection
Do you see good intentions
Where I see no progression?

Speak soft, speak soft your forgiveness
Tell me lies, tell me that I deserve it
Speak soft, speak soft, say I'm perfect
That every promise that I break is worth it

Why should I stick around
When all I do is let you down?
I'm bad news, you can't deceive me
I'd never choose to be me

Can I give you an answer?
We're beauty and the cancer
You're an always shining silver lining
I'm a fucking born disaster

Speak soft, speak soft, of your patience
Tell me how I'm distant and complacent
Speak soft, speak soft your frustration
Unacquainted with your expectations

Why should I stick around
When all I do is let you down?
I'm bad news, you can't deceive me
I'd never choose to be me

Seems all I know is what I'm not
(Speak soft, speak soft)
I can't seem to find the words
To remedy how bad this hurts
Seems all I know is what I'm not
(Speak soft, speak soft)
When you're staring down a loaded gun
Can anyone fall back on love?

I can't seem to find the words
To remedy how bad this hurts
Seems all I know is what I'm not
(Speak soft, speak soft)
When you're staring down a loaded gun
Can Anyone Fall Back On Love?

Speak Soft, Speak Soft
Why should I stick around
When all I do is let you down?
I'm bad news, you can't deceive me
I'd never choose to be me
