UPSWING

Another night I spend alone
Dinner for one and tv shows
(You knocked me down)
Set me alight, I'll still feel cold
Subsequent to a life you chose

I'm just a fact you read, I'm in your head, then out again
I'm the skin you shed and want until the winter's end
The corners of your room get your attention more than I do
And I tried so fucking hard for you!

Another night it takes its toll
I brace the heartache with my skull
(You knocked me down)
I'm such a mess it's laughable
A foolish boy with no control

I'm just a fact you read, I'm in your head, then out again
I'm the skin you shed and want until the winter's end
The corners of your room get your attention more than I do
And I tried so fucking hard for you!

I thought you were perfect 'cause I only looked at you close!
Like I saw life through a telescope!
Then I backed away, saw my potential in everything!
I knocked you down on my upswing!

I'm just a fact you read, I'm in your head, then out again
I'm the skin you shed and want until the winter's end
The corners of your room get your attention more than I do
And I tried so fucking hard for you!
