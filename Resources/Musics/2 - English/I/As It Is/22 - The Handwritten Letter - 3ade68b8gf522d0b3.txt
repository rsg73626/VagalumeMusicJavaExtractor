THE HANDWRITTEN LETTER

There's a song that sounds a lot like you
It pulls me up, just like it pulls me apart
Optimistic meets a dismal tune
You're all the while, broken and mended hearts

You take my silences and make them less alone
A fresh coat of paint inside my coffin so it feels like home
I know I'm not enough, out on my own
No, I'm not enough

I need you when I'm bruised and broken
It's all that keeps me here and hoping
I'm tangled in your mind unwoven
I need you when I'm bruised
I need you when I'm broken

There's a truth to finding all your lies
You make me love the way that I fall apart
Common misery is all we have
You're all the while dead ends and glowing starts

You take my silences and make them less alone
A fresh coat of paint inside my coffin so it feels like home
I know I'm not enough, out on my own
No, I'm not enough

I need you when I'm bruised and broken
It's all that keeps me here and hoping
I'm tangled in your mind unwoven
I need you when I'm bruised
I need you when I'm broken

You're not going into heaven

You take my silences and make them less alone
A fresh coat of paint inside my coffin so it feels like home
I know I'm not enough, out on my own
No, I'm not enough

I need you when I'm bruised and broken
It's all that keeps me here and hoping
I'm tangled in your mind unwoven
I need you when I'm bruised
I need you when I'm broken
Broken!
I need you when I'm broken
Broken!
