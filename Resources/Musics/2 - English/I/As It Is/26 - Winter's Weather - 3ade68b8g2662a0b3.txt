WINTER'S WEATHER

How long, how long 'til I'm no longer a shadow
'Cause I've been thinking I'd so love to feel again
Silence; I screamed her name
And wondered why you never came
I wear my
I wear my curse you wear my cure

(I feel destined)
I never thought I'd be this way
(for disaster)
Without you I'd just fade away

Please see in me what I can't see
I'm begging
Please won't you be the light
I need so desperately

My heart has habits
of silhouetting all my sense
I get your worth, you get my
You get my worst

(I feel destined)
I never thought I'd be this way
(for disaster)
Without you I'd just fade away

Please see in me what I can't see
I'm begging
Please won't you be the light
I need so desperately

I look for love in everybody else
'Cause I tried but I can't love myself
Please see in me what I can't see
I'm begging

I'm begging

Hold me close in winter's weather
I'm too weak to pull myself together

I've tried so hard to grow in a place without your warmth
Now there's nowhere left for me unless
It's safe between your arms

Please see in me what I can't see
I'm begging
Please won't you be the light
I need so desperately

I look for love in everybody else
Cause I tried but I can't love myself
Please see in me what I can't see
I'm begging
