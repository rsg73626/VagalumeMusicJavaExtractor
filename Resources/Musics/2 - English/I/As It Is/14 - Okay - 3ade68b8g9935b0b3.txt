OKAY

I don't know if I've been worse
I don't know if I can change
But right now, I don't think, I don't think that I'm okay

I felt a year's worth of hurt and sadness catching up with me
The sky I painted to silence the pain, it is bleeding into grey
I don't know if I've been worse
I don't know if I can change
But right now, I don't think, I don't think that I'm okay
I don't think that I'm okay. I don't think that I'm okay

In unfamiliar, somber surroundings, confessing all of me
A perfect stranger, she puts pen to paper, consoling in her sleep
And how foreign it felt when I opened my mouth and heard the truth come out (I heard the truth come out)
I've been running away, a tired respite from pain
My only Novocaine (my only Novocaine)

I don't know if I've been worse
I don't know if I can change
But right now, I don't think, I don't think that I'm okay
I don't think that I'm okay. I don't think that I'm okay

So keep your "It'll get better's" and I'll keep my "I'll be just fine's"
I'll show you flashes of colors and hide behind bouquets of lies
So keep your "It'll get better's" and I'll keep my "I'll be just fine's" (I'll be just fine)
I'll show you flashes of colors and hide behind bouquets of lies

I don't know if I've been worse
I don't know if I can change
But right now, I don't think, I don't think that I'm okay
I don't think that I'm okay. I don't think that I'm okay
I don't think that I'm okay
