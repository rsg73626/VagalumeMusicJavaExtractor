MY OCEANS WERE LAKES

More thought is less that said
More thought inside my head
Hard times and violent tides
Closed eyes and still frame minds
Cause all the thoughts hate modern words
it's not just the truth that hurts
Scars heal but never stray
Will I see another day (another day)


I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see that)
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see that)


Before and aftermath
Lost cause don't count less past
Lose grips and handlebars
Dull glove, lesser stars
I fall short with every mile
With fist fights and single file
If love is just washed away
Would I see a brand new day
A brand new day


I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see that)
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
(I'm starting to see that)


I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
I'm starting to see my oceans were lakes
