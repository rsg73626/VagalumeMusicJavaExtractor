PRETTY LITTLE DISTANCE

I want to cross stitch shut my eyes
Wage a war on the world outside
Brace the barricade in my mind, but that's alright
I stretch the truths 'til they lose shape
As support beams bend and break
Watch reality's slow cascade, but that's alright
And I've been thinking

Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?
Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?

I watch the sun dry out the grass
Hear the silence shatter glass
Feel perfection swerve and crash, but that's alright

Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?
Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?

Close my eyes, hope it all ends well this time
Close my eyes, hope it all ends well this time
Go!

Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?
And that's alright

Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?
Ain't life swell from a pretty little distance?
I don't want to leave, I don't want to stay
Why look twice at a beautiful existence?
