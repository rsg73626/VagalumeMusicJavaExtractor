DROWNING DEEP IN DOUBT

What good is a life
When you live it ashamed?
I dream just to be halfway
But all I am is the product of wasted effort
and best intentions
If the only place I belong is an afterlife
that I just can't believe in
At least I'll know I was born
so not everyone lives and dies on their own
Woah, this world I tore apart
Let me drown it deep in doubt
This fire in my heart
Is beginning to burn me out
What good is a life
When you live it alone?
I just want to be wanted
We do this while you start wondering
if disaster is what you're build for
Will slowly learn to accept
that I won't have more than a life on the sidelines
Or will I always be dreaming of liking life
from the darkness alone
Woah, this world I tore apart
Let me drown it deep in doubt
This fire in my heart
Is beginning to burn me out
It's so hard to feel anything but empty
It hurts just to feel anything at all
It's so hard to feel anything I want to
It hurts just to feel
It hurts just to feel
Woah, this world I tore apart
Let me drown it deep in doubt
This fire in my heart
Is beginning to burn me out
Woah, this world I tore apart
Let me drown it deep in doubt
This fire in my heart
Is beginning to burn me out
