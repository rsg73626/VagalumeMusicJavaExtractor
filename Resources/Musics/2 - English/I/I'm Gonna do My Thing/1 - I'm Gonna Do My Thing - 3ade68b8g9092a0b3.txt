I'M GONNA DO MY THING

You're not the police
You're not the president
You're not the p-p-pope
And it's evident

So maybe you should let me be

I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing

You're not my doctor
You're not my hand to hold
You're not the cia
I can't be bought and sold

So maybe you should let me be

I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing

Can't you see that you cannot
control the man I am
I am not a puppet on your string
So maybe you should check yourself
Before you tell me what you think of me
If I'm too hot to handle baby
Drop the heat
Cause this is me

I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do my thing
