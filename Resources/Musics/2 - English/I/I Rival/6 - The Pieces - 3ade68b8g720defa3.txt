THE PIECES

I started off today all by myself
But one by one by one the pieces fell
Out of place and into grace
You just fell
Out of grace and into place
Just where you belong

Why did you throw it away
Cause nothing lasts forever
It's hard enough to give it up
But you made it look effortless

I wasted the day away fighting with myself
I don't know which side won but one by one the pieces fell
Out of place and into grace
You just fell
Out of grace and into place
Just where you belong

Why did you throw it away
Cause nothing lasts forever
It's hard enough to give it up
But you made it look effortless
[x2]

Woah you fell out of grace
Woah woah
Woah you fell out of grace
We fell into place

Why did you throw it away
Cause nothing lasts forever
It's hard enough to give it up
But you made it look effortless
[x2]
