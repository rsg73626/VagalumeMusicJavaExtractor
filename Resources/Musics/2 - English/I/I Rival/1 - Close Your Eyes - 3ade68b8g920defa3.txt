CLOSE YOUR EYES

I see you through the crowd
You look so awake
Close your eyes

We are the ones
Who call ourselves dreamers
We are who we are

We all try to see what's next for us
Close your eyes don't wake up
Don't wake up tonight

I've got a lot to say hey
Don't hold back
You'll see that you'll regret
Just close your eyes

We are the ones
Who call ourselves dreamers
We are who we are

We all try to see what's next for us
Close your eyes don't wake up
Don't wake up tonight

Just waste your life away
But I'll kick and fight
Despite all the things you've said
And I'll kick and fight
To never wake up
Never wake up again

We all try to see what's next for us
Close your eyes don't wake up
Don't wake up tonight
