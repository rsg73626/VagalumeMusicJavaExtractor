FIGURED ME OUT

Lock me up tight so I don't leave your side
Keep me away from all the things that you would rather me not see
In this life time
What if I caught a glimpse and didn't stop staring

I know that you would rather me
Just be something
That you can relate to I'll just escape you
And this passion that you're fashioning

There was a fight and I left your side
You pushed me away away away
And I think I'll stay this time around
Round and round we go
What if I caught a glimpse and didn't stop staring

I know that you would rather me
Just be something
That you can relate to I'll just escape you
And this passion that you're fashioning

Hey you don't accuse
Let me do this for myself
Hey you don't accuse
Don't accuse me, don't try to use me up
Just let me go

You're so by the book
But I'm, I'm living for the hook
Come on
Just come on and trust me maybe
You'll let go, just let go
So come on and trust me maybe
You'll let go

I know that you would rather me
Just be something
That you can relate to I'll just escape you
And this passion that you're fashioning
