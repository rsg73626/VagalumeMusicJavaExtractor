COLORS

The color is fading from your face
Hold on, we'll get it back
Unless you don't want to replace it
We'll erase it
A new color is fading to your face
Hold on we'll push it back
Unless you want to embrace it
I'll just face it

So show me the world
And tell me that the colors I've been seeing
Are not while I was dreaming
Just show, show me your world
And tell me that the colors I've been needing
Are not the ones you're keeping away

There's something amiss and I'm on to it
I'm onto you
You tried on blue, didn't you?
Oh no, oh no it's coming
That's the one color I can't see
Hold it or hold on to me
You tried on blue, what's the use?
Oh no, oh no it's coming

So show me the world
And tell me that the colors I've been seeing
Are not while I was dreaming
Just show, show me your world
And tell me that the colors I've been needing
Are not the ones you're keeping away

Am I see through, what's the use
If we were fading long ago, long ago
That's how it's gonna go
If you don't see me then you shouldn't be
A part of my life
That's how it's gotta go
There's something missing from your eyes
It's killing off your smile
Keep pretending that you're fine
But you just lost your shine

So show me the world
And tell me that the colors I've been seeing
Are not while I was dreaming
Just show, show me your world
And tell me that the colors I've been needing
Are not the ones you're keeping away
