IN MY HEAD

Will I win this war
I've had my doubts before
They cripple all the drive in me
So long just say it

When I win this war
I want my life like before
So fearless, so certainly sure
So long, just say it
So long, no hesitating
So long, so long
I won't miss you when you're gone

Cause we're here right now
Let's keep on living
Like we never had a doubt
Cause we're here right now
Let's keep on living
Like we never, we never had a doubt

They say I won't win this war
I've woke up with doubt before
But it won't cripple the motive in me

So long, just say it
So long, no hesitating
So long, so long
I won't miss you when you're gone

Cause we're here right now
Let's keep on living
Like we never had a doubt
Cause we're here right now
Let's keep on living
Like we never, we never had a doubt

Ignore the sounds they make
I like mine better anyways
I hope you know you are never alone and I hope
You know you are never alone in your head

Cause we're here right now
Let's keep on living
Like we never had a doubt
Cause we're here right now
Let's keep on living
Like we never, we never had a doubt
Never had a doubt
We never had a doubt
Never

I hope you know you are never alone in your head
You know you are never alone and I hope
You know you are never alone in your head
You know you are never alone and I hope
You know you are never alone in your head
