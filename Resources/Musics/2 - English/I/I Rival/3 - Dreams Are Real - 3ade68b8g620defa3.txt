DREAMS ARE REAL

I can't sleep I can't breathe take me with you
If you were here you'd make this all worth while

This dream I had I died inside
You left us all and the tears fell hard
I see you everywhere
I want you here
You brought to light what we all now fear

I can't sleep I can't breathe take me with you
If you were here you'd make this all worth while
I can't sleep I can't breathe
We remember in our hearts every time you made us smile

It hurts so much but I can not wake
These closed soaked eyes see only you
I can see you through the moment
Can you see me through the fog
I'll scream so loud
And cut through with this song

I can't sleep I can't breathe take me with you
If you were here you'd make this all worth while
I can't sleep I can't breathe
We remember in our hearts every time you made us smile

So ask me if I'm ok I'm ok
Is everything alright is everything ok
Just let me know when everything's right
Just let me know when everything's good

I can't sleep I can't breathe take me with you
If you were here you'd make this all worth while

I can't sleep I can't breathe
When I awake you'll be standing there
