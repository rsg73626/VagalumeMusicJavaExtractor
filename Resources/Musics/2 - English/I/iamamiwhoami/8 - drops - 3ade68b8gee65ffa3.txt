DROPS

Give up, let down
Can't believe what I found
(be quiet, be silent, be words from your mouth)
Build up from ground
Wipe clean of your frowns
(dance around, be fry, be right up now)

When my wrong (come back)
Cost you all (come back)
Sticks like glue (oohoohoooh)
Obstructs my view

Speak out of that den
Washing clothes to keep dry
(tonight, we ride)
Feeling hard to boil
No time to stop
(we try, to hide, don't waste our time)

Give up, let down
Can't believe what I've found (found, fouuuun)
(be quiet, be silent, be words from your mouth)
Build up from the ground
Wipe clean of your frowns (frowns, frooooww)

When my fault
Cost you all

(ahhah)
(ahhah)
(oohooh)
(ahhah)
(ahhah)

Until I'm through (ooooooh)
