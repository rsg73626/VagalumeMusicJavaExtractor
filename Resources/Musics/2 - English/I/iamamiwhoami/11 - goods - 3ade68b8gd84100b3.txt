GOODS

I come bearing legacy
That we caused your leaving our dawning land
I come with delivery
And I have wrapped it in my mourning band

I bring you my history that I expect your tender arms around it
Give it love and think of me
These are the letters from a compound

See the dawning of novelty
Where we embrace the grin of subtlety
Time finally caught up with me
Molded in the image of the fleeing fugitive

Toned down but playful
Say your greetings with goodbyes
Your cup is brim full
Sorrow sinking with a smile

Now we found a cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to decide just who it's for

Now we found a cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to decide just who it's for

Don't expect to hear from me
'Cause I have got to feed a hungry mouse
I do enjoy your company
But we must work to keep you content

I see the better and the worse in me
I embrace the grin of subtlety
Courage finally caught up with me
Molded in the image of the fleeing fugitive

Now we found a cure
Tiny, tiny shore
Change is always given to decide just who it's for

Now we found a cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to decide just who it's for

Now we found a cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to decide just who it's for

Now we found a cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to decide just who it's for

Toned down but playful
Say your greetings with goodbyes
Your cup is brim full
Sorrow sinking with a smile
