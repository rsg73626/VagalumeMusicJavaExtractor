THE DEADLOCK

Making every day renew
Mostly just thinking of you
Most heartedly with gratitude
But your methods all were tried and true

A world of trouble inside of me grow
I feel it move, I feel it flow
My story writes itself on true
It won't be long, I'll see you soon

We spent life inside of our heads
Couple together, wires of red
We built a fort so strong to hold
For times of harsh and winters of cold
We spent all the beauty we made
Memories by hand to replay
Hear these simple words unfold
For this occasion I chose

You and me, we spent our days
Trapped inside our thickening haze
Slowly running out of ways
To reinvent our shrinking maze

Once I was shiny and new
Unsteady look a silent gloom
Who knew what I would turn into?
Who knows my world?
Who shares my view?

We spent life inside of our heads
Couple together wires of red
We built a fort so strong to hold
For times of harsh and winters of cold
We spent all the beauty we made
Memories by hand to replay
Hear these simple words unfold
For this occasion I chose
