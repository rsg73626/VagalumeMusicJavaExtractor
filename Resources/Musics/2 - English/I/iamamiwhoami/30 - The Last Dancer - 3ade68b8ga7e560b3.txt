THE LAST DANCER

The life is gone from this room
There's no future for me here
There was dancing and the mood
Shifted from tender to a lifeless beat
Needless happy as in june
When there's battles they know why we bleed
I will not be equal to the fool who challenges all your misdeed

Look at the stars in the winter sky
Everything will be tonight
What a beautiful day to die

The last I saw of myself was a shadow in the water stream
In the life that I have left
To walk into the land of defeat
And this is home, this is wealth
Awakening to the sound of the sea
Where I can watch from a distance and rule my land of misery

Look at the stars in the winter sky
Everything will be tonight
What a beautiful day to die
Feel the air all cold and dry
Everything will be just fine
What a beautiful day to die

Push through from the former over my shoulder waiting to take me home
I've misery calling, not important, willing to leave for hope
Push through from the former over my shoulder waiting to take me home
I've misery calling, not important, willing to leave for hope
