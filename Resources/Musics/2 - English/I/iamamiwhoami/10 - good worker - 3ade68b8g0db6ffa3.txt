GOOD WORKER

You make a neat and tiny house
A good worker does
A pinion of labours men
As capable as trust

From another point of view
Come stay in the light too
Keeping yourself unaware
Confident without your care
Locking out your little mind
Lurking for some time and space
Ready for some further use
Denial is a virtue

I make a good and steady friend
A companion through life
But who am I
When all I am is your designated wife?

Take me where I'm not to find
Where you're taking me?
