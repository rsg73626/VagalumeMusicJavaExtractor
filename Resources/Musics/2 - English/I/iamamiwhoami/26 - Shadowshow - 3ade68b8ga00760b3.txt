SHADOWSHOW

I am fire, I am damage in the making
I am an army set out to control your every ticking
I am a giant stepping on the tiny world you live in

And you shake and you shiver
As the roof is coming down
And the walls grow thinner

Shadowshow darkens the river
Turn hearts into stone
We run, we run
Terrified, what have we done?
Is this how it goes?
Silence grows
Loudly bigger
Its heartrending crow
You run, you run
Terrified, what have you done?
Is this how it goes?
It's how it goes

Mass confusion, never been so excited
What your hearts felt for us was evidently unrequited
And by the sea we're laying down our hopes
You will conquer all
Your rise our fall
And by the sea I'm laying down my hopes
We will conquer all
Our rise your fall

And I shake and I shiver
As I cut through skin and bones
Can you solve the riddle?

Shadowshow darkens the river
Turn hearts into stone
We run, we run
Terrified, what have we done?
Is this how it goes?
Silence grows
Loudly bigger
Its heartrending crow
You run, you run
Terrified, what have you done?
Is this how it goes?
It's how it goes

Let the shadows swallow all
Let the dark upon us fall
I am fire, I am damage in the making
I am an army set out to control your every ticking
