BLUE BLUE

In the blackened waters of conceit
I saw my silhouette, pale and bleached
All the outlines in no shape
Dash the surface for the self to show
Displays of a shadow I should know
Unless you define me, there's no faith

Continue the line I draw
Fill in the missing one
Without you, you
I am blue

Build me up on rising tide
Lift me up and make me soar
Out of the blue blue
I'll be new

Hear this banter, bringing soars
Against the current, change the course
When I land aside, give me pace
Owning up to each other's spell
Rewrite the story that I now tell
Come let's run, from the chase

Continue the line I draw
Fill in the missing one
Without you you
I am blue

Build me up on rising tide
Lift me up and make me soar
Out of the blue blue
I'll be new

Across the endless blue
Seeking the truth, I guarantee
Reflect to black and white, I shine
I'll make it, you decide

Continue the line I draw
Fill in the missing one
