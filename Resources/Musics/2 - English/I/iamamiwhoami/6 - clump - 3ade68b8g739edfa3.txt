CLUMP

I never dreamed I'd need someone like you
All I want to fit is be the unity of you
But I like you

You see the overall of what we are
and see the sad sad sight of you from a fall
Why don't you call?

Whatever made you into clump like you
The ice and cold that leaks out the cracks in you
Makes us as new
Whatever made you seem so very small
like a tiny ant in life but large in thought
Who's standing tall

Cannot wait until I get my hands on you
We can do the things we said we would

You never had a true friend like I
Someone to pick you up when you needed to
Be carried through

If my hands weren't so very sharp
This broken glass that surrounds wherever we are
Wouldn't do us part (part)

Whatever made you into clump like you
The fiery warmth that reeks out from most of you
Is burning through
Whatever made you seem so very small
like a tiny ant in life but large in thought
Come stand up tall

Cannot wait until I get my hands on you
We can do the things we said we would
Cannot wait until I see your smiling faces
And our love will be misunderstood
