THIN

A fire's beneath the cloak of night
Has my eyes in control
We guarding them with our weary eyes
And we watch them grow
When the time is right
And we're ready to begin
At the first tide, your patience wearing thin
Scattered in from night
I scrawl it in a winter white
Melting into thin air

The kind of witch I came to be
Left of being swallowed whole
By offering a piece of me
To any given form
Scattered in the mud
Like innocent shades of white
Spreading by the wind

(Change goes on)
(Wind blows salt)

They down to earth
They ask us why
Who said we had a chance?
Want me to fall?
They down to earth (through the wind, through the wind)
They ask us why
Who said we had a chance?
Want me to fall?

Too thin (through the wind, through the wind)
Too thin
Too thin (through the wind, through the wind, through the wind)
(Change goes on)
(Through the wind, through the wind, through the wind)
(Wind blows salt)
