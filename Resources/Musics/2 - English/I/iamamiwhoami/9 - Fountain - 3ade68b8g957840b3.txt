FOUNTAIN

What lies beyond the fringe of the woods?
Dust to dust, so we leave for good
Where no one's gone to places
I start to run
Until I find places where nobody's gone
No more weight on your bones
As with ease, I go back to the start

Search for a fountain
Riptide
And swallow me
Promise of a fountain
In sight
Go forwards from the sea
When you hear a siren
Uptime
Then watch me be

Crawling through the thinning good
Turning head, there's no sign of home
Though my body's aching
We have to push on
For every start
No line is drawn

Search for a fountain
Riptide
And swallow me
Promise of a fountain
In sight
Go forwards from the sea
When you hear a siren
Uptime
Then watch me be

From watching eyes
I blind it awful
To guard my stories
And fear the cold

When you hear a siren
Uptime
Then watch me be

What lies beyond the fringe of the woods?
Dust to dust, so we leave for good
