HOW IT GOES

I am fire, I am damage in the making
I am an army set out to control your every ticking
I am a giant, stepping on the tiny world you live in
And you shake and you shiver
As the roof is coming down
And the walls crumble in your hand

Shadows show dark as the river
Turn knights into stone
We run, we run terrified
What have you done?
Is this how it goes?
It's how it goes

Mass confusion, never been so damn excited
What your heart's felt for us was evidently unrequited
And I shake and I shiver
As I cut through skin and bones
Can you solve the riddle?

Shadows show dark as the river
Turn knights into stone
We run, we run terrified
What have you done?
Is this how it goes?
It's how it goes
