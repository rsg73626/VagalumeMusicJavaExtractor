T

A backwards march
My back against meadows of fear
Where it all began
And there's a hunt, for they seek the whom
And the purest of hearts let their spirits be consumed

There's a new world laid at your feet
We build an army from nothing
We raise our children to the beat of its comforting pounding

A forward talk
Solely against old ways and means
We're not like them, nesu
I'm on a hunt to find the cure
And before I depart into the deepest blue

Behind all insecurity there is a wall of assurance
She is her own worst enemy
She fights her battles for no one

There's a new world laid at your feet
We build an army from nothing
We raise our children to the beat of its comforting pounding

Let it sink in for a new beginning
You know better now
Water fills her lungs and she's inhaling
You feel better now
Underneath the stars, her body sinking
You do better now
A heavy sigh then not a sound

We have no lives to sacrifice
She makes us sing, dampens the cries
If there's a want for something new
You might find me at the start or where it ends for you

Let it sink in for a new beginning
You know better now
Water fills her lungs and she's inhaling
You feel better now
Underneath the stars, her body sinking
You do better now
A heavy sigh then not a sound
