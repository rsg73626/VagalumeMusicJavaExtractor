DIVE

Dive into depths unknown
Mouth open full of water
Salty head to toe
Prepared to lose what matters

No ounce of common sense
We drive ourselves across borders
Passed the sound of sense
Too late to swim for the surface
Salty as we're sinking faster
Trading tears for laughter
Down our deepest ocean

Shield wrap around the hurt
Let the icy cool down the burn
Let it probe into those veins
Taking us to shoreless bays
So I can bring you closer to
Understanding all you need to follow
You want to follow

Salty as we're sinking faster
Trading tears for laughter
Down our deepest ocean
Leading us to nowhere
