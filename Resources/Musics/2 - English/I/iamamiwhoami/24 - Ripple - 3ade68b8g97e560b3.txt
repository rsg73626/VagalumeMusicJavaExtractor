RIPPLE

With one hand above the rising line
Fighting to keep my innocence dry
Before I sail this raft aground
If we won't live to hear the sound

No built ship can save mankind
They'll be holding their breaths for the rest of their lives
Before you sail the raft aground
Join us in the search and take a dive

Dancing in this side of these driftwood
They see the forest for the trees
