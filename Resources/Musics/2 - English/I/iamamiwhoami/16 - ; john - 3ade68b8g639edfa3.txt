; JOHN

Used to be clean
Now I'm filthy as can be
Scrubbing off every spot

Used to be mean
Now I'm good as can be
Raise me up,
I'm your slut

May the God of me protect my soul
As I stay a little while longer
In this dusty rabbit hole
To sing my song chained onto your bed

Used to be told
My silence is gold
Coughing up every drop

Used to get smart
Now I'm granting you art
Stepping up,
I'm your star
