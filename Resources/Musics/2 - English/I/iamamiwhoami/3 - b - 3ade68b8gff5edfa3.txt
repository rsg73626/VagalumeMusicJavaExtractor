B

There he was, alone at the gate
We should pack our things and run away
Rest in the quicksand
Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand
Sink slowly now, take flight
Let silence take this empty light
Take a deep breath as we go, as we go

Wanting higher
Wanting higher love
Wanting higher
Until the moon forces us to climb back down
And rushing, running for the shore

Wanting higher
Wanting higher love
Wanting higher

With a harsh, unpleasant hello
The paranoia I've learned to live with although
I will never shape what's there behind
Your songs are still playing in my mind
All the white only turns to blue
Look after me and I'll look after you
Take a deep breath as we go, as we go
