VISTA

Want, want, want, you
?
Stretching out before my eyes
Are riches who ruled all that was
Regal shimmer, blinding shine
But hollow has been all verses wide
To all the shallow rifts I had to wade
This could?ve become my darkest hour
Enough days, all lived in the shade
?
I see harbour troupe
Hissing underneath the tide vista
Hide my land of frozen soil
Despise all that's there if you're looking at mine
?
Can you follow me (want)
And I?ll do if you (you) take my hand (all!)
This is all for you, (want)
Will you be there to (you)... to take it all, all, all !
?
Improbable place unknown
Untouched and all undestroyed
Here I let my armies grow
Our voices will it loudly crow
And I'm here at a deadly poor end
Never believed to cure the doubt
Want the world rushing through my veins
?
I see harbour troupe
Hissing underneath the tide vista
Hide my land of frozen soil
Despise all that's there if you're looking at mine
?
Can you follow me (want)
And I?ll do if you (you) take my hand
This is all for you (want),
If you give a shot
?
Want, 
(lies) if you
Take it all (lies) 
Want,
(lies) if
Want if,
Want, 
If you
To take it all
If
?
Can you follow me through the second round, hey
Can you taste the pain what sounds against your tongue
?
I see harbour troupe
Hissing underneath the tide vista
Hide my land of frozen soil
Despise all that's there if you're looking at mine
?
Can you follow me (want)
And I?ll do if you (you) take my hand
This is all (want) for you,
If you give a shot
(Will you be there to...) to take it all!
