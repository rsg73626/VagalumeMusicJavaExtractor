O

I thought I felt a spark
Thought I saw a flame
When something changed in you
Who took the blame?

My plan was foolproof
As I became
A fortress of your heart

Love
The kind that kills and scars
And makes you kneel and crawl
To hell and back

The words that slit your throat
And make you think of love
As the new black
As what you lack

The sound of letting go
A side of you
That we all set aside
When the world was new

Under the full moon
Only endless rain
An absence of your heart

Love
The kind that kills and scars
And makes you kneel and crawl
To hell and back

The words that slit your throat
And make you think of love
As the new black
As what you lack
