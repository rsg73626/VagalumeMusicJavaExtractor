CHASING KITES

It?s a thin thin line and I've walked both sides of it
Seen the other side appear so tempting 
Worth dying for it
And your limbs aching out of want
Absorbing your every thought
Worth risking it all for 
Working its wonders now for you

Over the ocean outcast with nowhere to go 
(nowhere to go, nowhere to go)
A brighter forecast, new winds will blow 
(we let go, let it go)
The storm that's drawing near 
Will calm and the air is clear
Waste my youth chasing kites 
I know will blow out of my hands

Push our heads in the sand
There is nothing here to seek
No discovery of mine will be safe in these seas
You feel that bitter taste on your tongue
Swallow your every wrong
Let your sins fill your lungs
Ending all worries now for you

Over the ocean outcast with nowhere to go 
(nowhere to go, nowhere to go)
A brighter forecast, new winds will blow 
(we let go, let it go)
The storm that's drawing near 
Will calm and the air is clear
Waste my youth chasing kites 
I know will blow out of my hands

Overlooking our past letting it go
A brighter forecast, new winds will blow
The storm that's drawing near
Will calm when the air is cleared
Waste my youth chasing kites 
I know will blow
