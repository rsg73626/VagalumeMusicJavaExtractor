KILL

Creeping, throbbing
Saunter from corner to wall
Trying to part the whispers from shouting and calls
This will is itching
This want is making me soar
What is expected, to seem a happy whore

Come on just kill these
Demands and notions
All this commotion is not worth it
Come on just give this 
A second coming
An age is dawning with all smiles 
And laughter
(x2)

One foot forward will you be catching my fall
Once I give
I know you'll be claiming more (from me)
You've had me scratching
You have been talking me sore
(come on, just kill this, come on) 
What is expected, to carry you in my arms
(come on, just kill this, come on)

Come on just kill these
Demands and notions
All this commotion is not worth it
Come on just give this 
A second coming
An age is dawning with all smiles 
And laughter
(x2)

Come on, just kill this (x12)
(and laughter)
Come on, just kill this (x6)
(and laughter)

Come on just kill these
Demands and notions
All this commotion is not worth it (not worth it)
Come on just give this 
A second coming
An age is dawning with all smiles 
And laughter 
(and laughter)
All smiles and laughter
