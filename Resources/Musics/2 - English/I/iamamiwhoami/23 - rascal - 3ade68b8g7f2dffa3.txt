RASCAL

Empty wound
At a single draft alone
Drain this ruin
The farthest one can come to close

Life could be better if I let me in
(What is to hold onto?)
But I force myself towards departing
(Leaving is what you do)

I had to make dirty in the soil
I had to be the rascal taking all
I wanted us to live in times of bliss
I couldn't evoke the memories I had missed

Left this wound
Abandoned my ideals for what?
(Want to be just like you)
Molded like I'm shaped in size with anyone
(Standing like I'm next to)
(Everyone just like you)

I had to make dirty in the soil
I had to be the rascal taking all
I wanted us to live in times of bliss
I couldn't evoke the memories I had missed

Shut your eyes fast, it all goes blank
channel the vision, feel the scent of
Someone who dared to lose it all
Someone who's ready to take the fall for it

(Shut and lightened up, when we rose)

I'm taking all, am I taking all
(I was the rascal I'm taking all) am I taking all?
I'm taking all, I'm not taking all
I was the rascal taking all, I'm not taking all
