TAP YOUR GLASS

Tap your glass
Let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass
And give it my all
We could tap our glasses
Let ourselves go now

Tap my glass, raise my voice
To call upon your attention
As it fills to the verge when full
It begs them for us all suspension
Draw breath and let ourselves go
Through the dark veil? s slowly flows
And feel the salt slowly fill your throat

Chorus
Tap your glass
Let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass
And give it my all
We could tap our glasses
Let ourselves go now
Tap your glass
Let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass
And give it my all
We could tap our glasses
Let ourselves go now

From the tide that's rising
Using all of my fault
I form shapes through all the sea
As easy as it goes
We are creating new islands
Now everything comes swallow
Them all (to the salt)
Drowning down, we drown, we drown
We drown, yeah, ooh

Let the shallows of above forget us
Getting closer to the bottom
Adventure of a life in the cold
Never to be forgotten
Unless they want to let themselves go
Unless they choose to be swallowed
Then the above will be visible

Chorus
Tap your glass
Let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass
And give it my all
We could tap our glasses
Let ourselves go now
Tap your glass
Let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass
And give it my all
We could tap our glasses
Let ourselves go now

From the tide that's rising
Using all of my fault
I form shapes through all the sea
As easy as it goes
We are creating new islands
Now everything comes swallow
Them all (to the salt)
Drowning down, we drown, we drown
We drown, yeah, ooh

(We are creating new islands!)
(Tide is rising!)
(We are creating new islands!)
