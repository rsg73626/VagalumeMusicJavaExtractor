SEVER

My look so grand from a distance that you need to touch
It gives a vision of the simple but it isn't much

I won't be fooled by its touch
An emotion is applied
The scent of a feel
In heavy lay with dry
The cold in the bed
That's sedated by was I
It's where we can rely
The look to grand

I must've forgotten the way we used to live full play
To be accepted, I must plant into convintous pain
And sing your device in wings

I won't be fooled by its touch
A motion is applied
The scent of a feel
In heavy
A cold in the bed
It's where we can rely
The look to grand
