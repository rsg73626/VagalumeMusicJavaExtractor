CHANGE NOTHING

Wake up,
But I haven’t been to sleep
Wondering,
Did it happen just for me?

Change, Nothing
N' Change, Nothing

Pleading,
But the time won’t anchor down
Holding on, holding on,
To these places we think we’ve found

Change, Nothing
N’ Change Nothing

Burn like we’ve never seen red before
And move like we’ve never been felt before

And I would change not a thing, about it
No...Change, Nothing

(Here we go)

Wake them up,
But they haven’t been to sleep
Moving time,
The morning’s starting to breathe

A part of us will never leave
A kiss for you while you dream
And I would change not a thing
I would change not a thing,

Change Nothing, nothing about it at all...
