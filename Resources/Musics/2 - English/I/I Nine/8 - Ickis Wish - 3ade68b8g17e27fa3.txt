ICKIS WISH

A basket full of fingers but I still need yours
A stirring world of eyes can’t fill unfixed glares
I’m on the shelf undusted and leaning
Instead of on your pillow
A forgotten stage and I’m leaning, I’m leaning!

I’m hoping you’re tripping over me over there
I’m watching you from across the room
I’m hoping you’re tripping over me under there
O’ hear me under there

Under there I wish you’d talk
Tell me if it’s all my fault
In the dark trying to fall, just to make a noise at all
Unconsciously while you’re sleeping
Oh and something else is creeping

I’m wishing to be like the pictures
All my dreams are to be like we were

I’m hoping you’re tripping over me back there
I’m watching as I’m riding away
I’m hoping you’re tripping over me somewhere
Sometime, sometime

I’m hoping you’re tripping over me in there
Cause I’m slower to loose the last insides
I’m hoping you’re tripping over me up there
Up there
Cause I – I’m Here
