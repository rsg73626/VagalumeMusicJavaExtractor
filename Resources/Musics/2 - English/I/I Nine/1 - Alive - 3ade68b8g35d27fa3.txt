ALIVE

I’m the queen of catastrophe the faded spade card in your deck of hearts
Squint my eyes at the dealer he hesitates
I can’t let my secrets out keep a straight face and calm the noise
Of this debt-ridden hand, I’m trying not to fold
Trying not to fold…

Wrestling time
I consciously rewind the second hand
Try to find the hour…I’m alive
I realize, I’m alive

Always try to comprehend as the odds of fate, start to wage
Do the ides of change make me feel alive?
The voices are screaming out, it happens now
Don’t get weighed down, and fade away
Away…

Wrestling time
I consciously rewind the second hand
Try to find the hour…I’m alive
I realize, I’m alive

Ooh…I’ve got a story to tell
Ooh…I’ve got a story to tell you

You can put me in a box I’ll break through the window
Hold me down, I’ll fight for my life…I’m alive!

Wrestling time
I consciously rewind the second hand
Try to find the hour…I’m alive
I realize, I’m alive

Here I go, grow by the light
I realize, I’m alive, yeah!
