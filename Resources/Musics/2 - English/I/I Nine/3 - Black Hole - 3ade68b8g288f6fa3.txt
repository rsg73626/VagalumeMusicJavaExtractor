BLACK HOLE

I found my box of letters in my old dresser-drawer
The ones you used to write but you don’t write me anymore
I even got a paper-cut trying to figure out
What to do with all of these memories now
And your not who you used to be and I wonder where you’ve gone

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there’s a universe of missing love
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments when we had so much?

Where’s the love?

Remember all those hours laughing on the floor
Those days of doing nothing
Felt like nothing did before
I tried flipping through these pictures of the way we used to be
God I’d give up everything to save you and me
This is not how we used to feel
And I wonder where you’ve gone

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there’s a universe of missing love
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments when we had so much?

Where’s the love?

I wanna go there
And I wanna know where
Everything that’s meant something to me has gone

This same old box of letters used to make me smile
But now I just feel lonely...

Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there’s a universe of missing love
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments when we had so much?

A black hole
Somewhere there's a universe of missing love
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments, the moments when we had so much?

Where's the love?
