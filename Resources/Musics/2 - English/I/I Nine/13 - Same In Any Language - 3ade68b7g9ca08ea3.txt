SAME IN ANY LANGUAGE

Sometime ago i met another hoe,
In a parking lot in tokyo,
He said everything wordlessly,
Wonderlust in my eyes he did see,
Oh yeah,
Oh oh yeah.

Those postcards i sent to birmingham,
All the way from those windows of amsterdam,
I copped a gram from dappersan
Just to fall at her man in another jam,
Oh yeah,
Oh oh yeah.

It's the same in any language,
A brother is a brother if there’s one thing i know,
It's the same in any language,
Wherever you go.

Oooo yeah

I ran out of jack in tripoli,
Oh those freedom fighters they were good to me,
They asked me all about tennessee,
And on one thing we all did agree,
Ooh yeah,
Yeah oh oh yeah.

It's the same in any language,
A brother is a brother if there’s one thing i know,
It's the same in any language,
Wherever you go.

Wherever you go,
Where are you going, to?
Oh oh no no no no,
Where are you going, to?
Where you going to?

Everything is...
Say say say say say where are you going, to?
So where are you going, to?
I say where are you going?
Hoo hoo yeah.
