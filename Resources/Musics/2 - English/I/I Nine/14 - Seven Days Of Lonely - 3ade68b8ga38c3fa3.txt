SEVEN DAYS OF LONELY

Ohh
I got a call today
At 3 AM
It's what you didn't say that told me I'd get hurt again.
So I hung up the phone
And I screamed out loud
I felt so alone, I should had said the things I'm thinking now

Ohh never thought it would be so hard to let you go

Tell me how I'm gonna make it your the one I cant forget
It's like I'm running in slow motion in a nightmare that never ends
When I try to face it when I wake up I hate the way reality sets in
God I wish you could hold me, through the seven days of lonely.
(The seven days of lonely, yeah)

Oh it's deafening
The bitter truth
I'm doing everything for the first time again without you
I pretend I'm ok
But it aches inside
There's got to be a way that's better then just getting by

Ohh never thought it be so hard to let you go

Tell me how I'm gonna make it your the one I can't forget
It's like I'm running in slow motion in a nightmare that never ends
When I try to face it when I wake up I hate the way reality sets in
God I wish you could hold me, through the seven days of lonely.

My heart is speeding up and slowing down to know I know it's over, it's over
And can you die of heartbreak to die for love lost young I pray to find it again, oh again

Got a call today
At 3 AM
It's what you didn't say that hurts again

Tell me how I'm gonna make it your the one I cant forget
It's like I'm running in slow motion in a nightmare that never ends
When I try to face it when I wake up I hate the way reality sets in
God I wish you could hold me
Through the seven days of lonely
Through the seven days of lonely
Through the seven days of lonely
Through the seven days of lonely
Ohhhhhh
