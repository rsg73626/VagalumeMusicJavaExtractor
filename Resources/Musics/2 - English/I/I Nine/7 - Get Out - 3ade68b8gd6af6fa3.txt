GET OUT

I can’t stop shaking
When you hold me
Cause I know we’re breaking
Inside I reason
I’ll make you love me
But I’m still mistaken
I guess I’m never enough
Somehow I’m too hard to love

But I’m smart enough to know we’re through
And hurt enough to live without you

Get outta my head, get outta my heart
Every time I turn around there you are
Get outta my face, from under my skin
Every time you crawl out I let you back in
So much pain without bleeding
I can’t handle this right now
Just for once, really leave me
Just get out

You’ve come back to haunt me
What’s the matter dear?
Are you afraid of being lonely?
You’re rein is ending
And it’s so clear
That you can’t control me
I always know when you lie
Somehow I let you get by

Now I’m smart enough to know we’re through
And hurt enough to live without you

Get outta my head, get outta my heart
Every time I turn around there you are
Get outta my face, from under my skin
Every time you crawl out I let you back in
So much pain without bleeding
I can’t handle this right now
Just for once, really leave me
Just get out!

Every time you’d leave me hanging here helplessly
Never knowing if you would be back for me
Like a child I would pear through windows desperately
Looking for a sign that you never gave me
I’m tired of being so led on and I’ve tried
To make this place a home but it’s broken...
It’s broken...

Get outta my face, from under my skin
Every time you crawl out I let you back in
Your outta my head
You’re outta my life
I’m free again without fear to fight
I got faith this time, peace of mind
I can be alone cause I’m whole inside

Your outta my head, your outta my life
Your outta my head, your outta my life

No more pain, no more hating
I understand things now
I don’t need you to save me
Just stay out...
