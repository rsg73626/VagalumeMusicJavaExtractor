BECKON

Dreaming it is something
I close my eyes
And early breaking, it’ll shiver you down
Your shoulders bare and the feeling is around me
I feel it around me

Where do you go when the dark calls you out?
Beckons by name
Where do you go, where do you go?

And wishing can be nothing
You stare all night with dreaming eyes
And evening’s breaking it’ll shiver you down
Your body’s bare and the feeling is abounding
I feel it abounding

Where do you go when the dark calls you out?
Beckons by name
Where do you go, where do you go?

Cause lonely only blows over you and
You and you
Oh but oh, it’s in the loneliest things we can do
Feel it and breathe it

Where do you go when the dark calls you out?
Beckons by name
Where do you go, where do you go?

Cause it’s in the lonely blow,
It’s in the lonely blow
