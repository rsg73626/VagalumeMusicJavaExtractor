SOLAR

My love will come through shadow into light of how imaginary space is)

My love will come
Fold me up
Notice the changes in my face
My love will come
Through shadow into light
Of how imaginary space is

Forget to open your eyes
Forget to check the door
Run to me thoughtlessly
The way you’ve only dreamed of

Go past the moon
Through my solar intercepting you

Silence will come
And hold us up
Notice the changes in this place
Silence will come
Through shadow into light
Of how unsanitary life is

Go past the moon
Through my solar intercepting you

Hey yeah!
Turn it off turn it off…

Go past the moon
Through my solar intercepting you
(Love, save us, save us, save us!)

Hey yeah!
Oh turn it on, turn it on…
