DON'T WANNA

Broke down, busted
Hot wired, dusty
I stole my car from the city lot
Cause last night’s buzz is all I got -
Now I’m rolling, wide eyed, I’m never stuck on the sidelines
Ask me why I gotta leave this town again

I’ll do what it takes to stay alive
Forget the rules; they don’t apply
I’d lose my mind at your 9 to 5
Cause it’s not my kind of life

I just wanna know why
Why I gotta be quiet
I don’t wanna just sit down and shut my mouth
All these things I could do without
I wanna new life
I just wanna drive all night
Wake up in the sunrise and love myself again!

We’re living on nothin’
Reachin’ for somethin’
Cheap t-shirts, old blue jeans
Big black boots and too much caffeine
Yeah I’m a smart ass, I’m up tight, I never back down from a fistfight
Might be why I gotta leave this town again!

I’ll do what it takes to stay alive
Forget the rules; they don’t apply
I’d lose my mind at your 9 to 5
Cause it’s not my kind of life

I just wanna know why
Why I gotta be quiet
I don’t wanna just sit down and shut my mouth
All that crap I could do without
I wanna new life
I just wanna drive all night
Wake up in the sunrise and love myself again!

And who are they to call me crazy
(You see what you wanna see)
You know their never gonna change me
(Cause I’ll be who I wanna be)
We gotta live the way we wanna
Cause nobody ever oughta just waste away, waste away

And what’s wrong with being happy
(Ya know you’d love it if you tried)
I know that everybody can be
(If only for a little while)

We’re gonna make it to the end
Ya gotta chase it till ya win, I wanna feel free, I wanna be free

I wanna new life
I wanna drive all night
I wanna wake up in the sunrise and love myself again

I just wanna know why
Why I gotta be quiet
I don’t wanna just sit down and shut my mouth
All this s*** I could do without
I wanna new life
I just wanna drive all night
Wake up in the sunrise and love myself again!

(We gotta live the way we wanna cause nobody ever oughta just waste away)
