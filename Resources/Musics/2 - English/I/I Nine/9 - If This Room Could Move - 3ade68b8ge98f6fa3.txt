IF THIS ROOM COULD MOVE

What if none of this could surround us?
If we could stop time, I wouldn’t mind if the world couldn’t find us
Watching all the smoke fall around us
Just you and I, waving goodbye as we leave it behind us

If this room could move like an aeroplane
Just take us up and far away from everything
If this room could move like the walls had wings
We could disappear tonight and do anything

Parachutes and pilots won’t be needed (to make our getaway)
We’ll still be safe, here in this place, wherever it takes us
What if you and I find our freedom? (and embrace a better way)
Get out of the race, the facts that we face, we just need to escape it

If this room could move like an aeroplane
Just take us up and far away from everything
If this room could move like the walls had wings
We could disappear tonight and do anything

Calling to the constellations
I wish to make the situation
Brighter by association
Higher than my imagination

If this room could move like an aeroplane
And take us up and far away from everything

If this room could move like the walls had wings
We could disappear tonight and do anything

If this room could move like an aeroplane
(I’ll take you there; I’ll take you there)
And take us up and far away from here
(We can go anywhere, we’ll go anywhere)
If this room could move like these walls had wings
(I’ll take you there; I’ll take you there)
We could disappear tonight, and do anything
