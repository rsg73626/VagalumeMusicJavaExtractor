I’LL BE THERE

Lone, I feel so alone
Nothing to hold-on-to, nothing to hold on
Gone, I feel so alone
Gone for money and you’re gone for love
You won’t be long

Cause I’ll be there

Sent home, you got nowhere to go
Better give me a garden, give me something to sew
You won’t be alone

Cause I’ll be there

You’re so preoccupied, by the simple life
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to go
You’re so preoccupied, by the simple lies

But I’ll be there

What can I do?
Pictures of you still make me smile, make me smile
What can I do?
Pictures of you still make me smile, make me smile

I’ll be looking for summertime
I’ll be waiting around
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to go

I’ll be looking for summertime
I’ll be waiting around
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to go
You’re never alone.
