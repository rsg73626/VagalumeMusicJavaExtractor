IN GOOD HANDS

In Good Hands
I believe in a special bond between two friends, and I try to think where we would have been, if not with each other, then where? Then where? But now we are growing up. Some feelings are growing out, but how could I forget those days? I can’t forget. No, please don’t take it the wrong way. We might not see each other every day but know you’re in my heart, and I hope you feel the same way too. Tell me, how could I forget the impact that we had on each others’ lives? I can’t forget. I can’t forget you, my friend. In good hands we have grown together and in good hands we have changed together, but the caring is still there. How could I possibly forget those days that we shared? They will never be shared with anyone else.
