THREE DAYS 'TIL CHRISTMAS

Three Days ‘til Christmas
Once again I get this feeling when I am around you a feeling of anticipation that this will last forever. When we are together our thoughts connect to form the one thing we all belong to, and now this feels great. Now this feels so good. I look back to better times, but these are the better times and I hope that they last forever. I hope that we last forever. It’s beautiful when you find the right people to befriend. If there are any empty holes I will replace them with brighter things from my heart.
