COUNTLESS ROOFTOPS

I remember that your heart always shined the brightest and now morning always comes too soon when I'm dreaming that you're still alive. Its cold outside now and the sunsets are still beautiful. 
I can't believe that you won't keep me up way past my bedtime anymore. You won't sneak me out of my window anymore, just to run around with you with no real destination in mind, but that didn't really matter anyways, because it's not where you're going or what you're doing, but who you are with. 
I was with you and you were with me, and everything was falling into place. 
I wish that I could tell you that the sun never stops shining when I think of you. When I think of those days when we owned the whole fucking world. Every rooftop in the city. 
When I think of those days when I held the hand of the best friend I ever had
