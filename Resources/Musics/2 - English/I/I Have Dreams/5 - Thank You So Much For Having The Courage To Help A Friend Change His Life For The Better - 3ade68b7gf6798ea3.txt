THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO HELP A FRIEND CHANGE HIS LIFE FOR THE BETTER

Healed broken hearts pour themselves out under a full moons light as we tell each other our dreams and scream it’s time for this change. I feel this revolutions flame cleaning me of all that holds me back now I’m breathing on my own. These days this world belongs to us. My heart has been set free. I won’t forget theses forever nights. Those warm hands and hugs that felt so good because you feel the same.
