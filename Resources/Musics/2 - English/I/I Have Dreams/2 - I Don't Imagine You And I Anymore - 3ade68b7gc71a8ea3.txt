I DON'T IMAGINE YOU AND I ANYMORE

I don't imagine you and I walking in the sun or holding hands anymore, but I can see your name burning in the stars and in the same sky I once floated above in. Now I can't look at the picture any longer, so I gave it back to you with a note attached saying how 
I felt. Do you remember that day we cried on your floor? Well I haven't stopped crying since. So where are your promises now? Your promises of forever and everything else. Not quite a fairytale ending. You have caused me the most pain I have ever felt in my life.
