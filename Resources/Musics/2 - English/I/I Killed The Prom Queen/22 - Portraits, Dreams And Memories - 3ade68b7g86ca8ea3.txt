PORTRAITS, DREAMS AND MEMORIES

I won't forget you
 You won't forget me
 I will choose to forget you
 
 One again my body will lay cold
 Once again your body will lay cold
 With no breath left you have died there
 With no breath left you have died now
 
 With no breath left your body will lay cold
 With no breath left you have died slowly
 When you lied there, when you died there
 
 Beneath my skin, through my veins
 Look at me as I am screaming out to no-one
 Look at me as I die again
 
 Tears will drown me, drip down your face
 Forgiveness denied Means you have to
 Means I have to choke myself
 
 These are my portraits
 These are my dreams
 These are my memories
 Memories will fade (away with you)
 
 YOU WON'T FORGET ME, YOU WILL DIE
