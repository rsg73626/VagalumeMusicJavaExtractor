SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND CITY LIGHTS

While you've been dreaming of the dead and lost.
I Have been awake kissing these clock faces
The fear of sleep has left me tired and worn
But in her dreams is where i will haunt her

I've seen the shadow of this burning angel.
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes
I'll pick up the peices when you've failed and fallen to the ground
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears
It will be ok. 

Go!

I, I, I took to the sky, Did you mourn for me?
Who needs flowers when your dead and buried?
For now my whisper Is my dearest friend
But even I know it wont last forever

I've seen the shadow of this burning angel.
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes
I'll pick up the peices when you've failed and fallen to the ground
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears
It will be ok. 

Smile when you think of me, The pain will go in time.
I may be alone with fear in my mind
I leave these words in hope that... That we'll meet again,
again.. now?

I Know this wont last forever, I Know this wont last forever
