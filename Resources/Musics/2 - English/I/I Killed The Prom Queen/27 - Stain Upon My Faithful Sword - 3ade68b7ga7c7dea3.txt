STAIN UPON MY FAITHFUL SWORD

So here I stand, breathless and waiting for nothing
Peer into my chest, see if this things still ticking
Anouther victem to the power noone gave you

Standing all alone, Ive relised, Im not giving up
The first time this touched me I became, an invention called zero
So as I walk from this earth, I'm taking 
you with me

Existence will fall.. down. betryed, securety.. fails
all hail your faceless god...lies, slain upon my faithful sword...trust
I will not bow. Compassion is locked inside and im holding useless keys
So here i stand, just waiting for nothing
Peer into my chest. rip me apart. 
as this lethal injection runs cold through my veins
Lights in my head slowley fade out im in the dark again
There will be no tolerance, for those with no respect

standing all alone, i've relised, im not giving up
If i walk from this earth, im taking you with me

Im sure these keys will open, a vile passion... 
Praying hands wont save purity
As this lethal injection runs cold through my veins
Lights in my head slowely fade out. Im in the dark again
All hail your faceless god
I Will Not Bow
