ARE YOU PLAYING DEAD?

Erasing every memory I have of you
 I hide the pictures away from me
 Are you happy with what you have done
 Throw away the future that you have created
 
 I cannot erase you
 
 A vision of
 Of perfection
 Pull out my eyes
 Cut through my heart
 
 As these hearts are the
 difference between me and you
 
 Out of the darkness you
 became the lowest immortal
 The ash felt is my bed,
 these broken foundations in my head
 
 Free yourself, Free your mind. Free yourself
 As you are captured, sold for spare parts
 
 A vision of
 Of perfection
 Pull out my eyes
 Cut through my heart
 
 Burn out my eyes
