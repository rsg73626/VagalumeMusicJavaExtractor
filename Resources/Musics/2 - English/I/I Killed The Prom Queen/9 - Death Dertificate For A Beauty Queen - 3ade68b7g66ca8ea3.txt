DEATH DERTIFICATE FOR A BEAUTY QUEEN

Cause I watched
 I've watched as dreams slowly waste away and die
 You are a post mortem beauty queen
 As razor blades cut me we suffer with every kiss
 Thinking I'm dying, choking as I burn
 
 As evil dies within me
 Sewing me back together
 
 Here again my heart is rusted through
 Look as yourself lying on a picture of misconception
 As we fall walking across the dead
 This is a memory of rotting destiny
 Our worst nightmare
 
 Your throat will bleed your skin will burn
 
 Your throat will bleed your skin will burn
 
 I've watched your skin burn
 
 Your warm hands touch my face
 As I look into your eyes
 Your dreams will slowly die
 Can you hear my voice?
 
 Your warm hands touch my face
 I took into your eyes
 Dreams will slowly die
 Can you hear my voice?
 Fuck you with all these lies
 Break me with all your words
 
 As I gasp for one last breath
 
 The tears from the fallen angels
 Will come to rise
 Come to rise
 Will come to rise
 
 I've watched as dreams slowly waste away and die
 You are a post mortem beauty queen
 As razor blades cut me we suffer with every kiss
 Thinking I'm dying, choking as I burn
 
 You have become our worst nightmare
