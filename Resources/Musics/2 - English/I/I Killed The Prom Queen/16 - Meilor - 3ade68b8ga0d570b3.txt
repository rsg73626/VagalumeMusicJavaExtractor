MEILOR

I kept waiting for the sun to rise
With the hope that nothing had changed through the night
And I'm still waiting for the tide to die
To be swept away and out of sight

Am I too far gone now
Too far to turn this around (turn this around)

My heart sways like the seasons change
So you can't help me sleep for days
Until you whisper, open your eyes and take a deep breath
It'll be alright

You've been there from the beginning
And I know you'll see this through

Am I too far gone now
Too far to turn this around (turn this around)
Oh

I kept waiting for the sun to rise
With the hope that nothing had changed through the night
And I'm still waiting for the tide to die
To be swept away and out of sight

Will I ever find my way
