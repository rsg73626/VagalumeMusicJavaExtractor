THE BEATEN PATH

In this isolation I
To silence this
And drown the world in apathy
And your narcissistic disease
This plague that you escape


Every thought is
death

So burn the bridge, tear us apart
Isolation, insulate my heart
So burn the bridge, tear us apart
Isolation, insulate my heart
Fuck

Dilate this void between us
And flood it with an ocean of disgust
No one
Just... an apathetic
Your every thought is
death

So burn the bridge, tear us apart
Isolation, insulate my heart
So burn the bridge, tear us apart
Isolation, insulate my heart

Isolation, insulate my heart
