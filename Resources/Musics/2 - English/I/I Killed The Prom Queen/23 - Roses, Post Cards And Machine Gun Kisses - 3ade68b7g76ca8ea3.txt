ROSES, POST CARDS AND MACHINE GUN KISSES

As your future is broken down,
 look back as your past is crumbling
 As hope denied again, looking into her eyes of hell
 
 You will break
 
 Gears will break, buried away
 Beat me to death now
 Beat me, beat me to death
 
 As I cry to your ashes as you cry to me
 
 So don't pretend to be my friend
 You cannot rectify your mistakes
 When every hope carries closure
 
 You have become the denied
 
 Loneliness is a lifetime, as years
 tormented your forced to die
 Soaking in a pool of your own blood
 Crushed bones engulfed in fire
 
 Forced to fall down
 Your blood still stains
 (Captive) As this time
 (Forever) And civilised structures
 (Captive) Will fall away
 (Forever)
 You are still blood stained
