BRIGHT ENOUGH

Could nights and colder hearts
We've been sinking from the start
Our hands seldom breach the surface
Break my chest I need to breathe
It's getting harder to believe
Why won't anybody help us

I won't give up on you
Cause your eyes are bright enough to see this through

I can't take it anymore

So please won't you sing me to sleep
I never want to wake up
I never want to feel like it's just a dream

Won't you sing me to sleep
I never want to wake up
I never want to feel like it's just a dream

Give me a pen and I'll write until my fingers start to bleed
Give me a chance and I'll try to make the world see what you see

I won't give up on you
And your eyes are bright enough to see this through

I can't take it anymore
Never again will it be like it was before
Broken hands, your bones on show
Who could ever blame you for letting go

Broken hands, your bones on show
Who could ever blame you for letting go
Please just hold on

So please won't you sing me to sleep
I never want to wake up
I never want to feel like it's just a dream

Won't you sing me to sleep
I never want to wake up
I never want to feel like it's just a dream
