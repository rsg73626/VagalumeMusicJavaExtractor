NIGHTMARES

With all that you've done
Would you ever give thought to the life that was slaughtered
Put you're just killing for
Like they... ? ... on your daughter

How can we be so heartless
They're beaten bloody and lifeless
We will be the voice

The voice for the voiceless
And give hope, to all the helpless
How can we be so... how can we be... be so heartless
They're beaten bloody... bloody and lifeless
We'll be the voice... voice for the voiceless
And give hope... hope for the helpless

Your body is your graveyard
And it's filled
Unbound the innocence
They're weren't ready to be buried yet

But this is the world we're living in
Murder is the cure, who's cashing in

We will be the voice
The voice for the voiceless
And give hope, to all the helpless
How can we be so... how can we be... be so heartless
They're beaten bloody... bloody and lifeless
We'll be the voice... voice for the voiceless
And give hope... hope to the helpless

How can you be so fucking heartless
