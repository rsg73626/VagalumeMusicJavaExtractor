TO KILL TOMORROW

When I feel the torment in your voice
Red eyes burn out the sun trapped in daylight
As this hope will break me,
this bloodshed is my fate
As this hope cries hearts of
loneliness will crush tradition
When I feel the darkness from your tears
Blood drips off the bridge of a clueless river
So stand alone, on the other
side when worlds collide
 
So stand alone when you
drown away from me now

Now please awake me from this dream
now wake me up (awake me)
Before I forget your name again
Now wake up (awake me)

As this world will consume me
Your words are ignorant
lonely walk through peak hour traffic
Blood drips from a clueless river
Feelings of a burnout poetry kiss
Your cold lips burn through daylight

Now please awake me from this dream
now wake me up (awake me)
Before I forget your name again
Now wake up (awake me)
 
As I feel my pulse stop as I breakdown,
barely breathing corroding away
Say goodbye to your hope this time, your
hands will choke me, choke me to death

Swallow your pride
This is my last goodbye kiss
