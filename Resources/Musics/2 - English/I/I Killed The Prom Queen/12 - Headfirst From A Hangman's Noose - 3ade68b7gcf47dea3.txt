HEADFIRST FROM A HANGMAN'S NOOSE

I've never compared myself. And I couldnt care anymore
I've never had it to hold so i've got nothing to lose
Your love left you broken hearted
"we could never have us, because i've never had you"
So let your eyes tell the tale. What was I ment to say
I thought of you too long, now a frozen smile
Wont even bring you back

Your kiss is no longer safe to me any more
Your lips have turned into something I Dont know anymore
They are the gates to a vicious tounge
Your razorblade wrists wont make this change or go away
I'd never trust, 
I'd never trust, those bloodshot eyes
I'd never trust, 
I'd never trust, those bloodshot eyes

This love was living with its eyes sewn shut
At times i'd love to bludgeon You and call my name

Idle thoughts spill constantly from open mouths.
With their eyes sewn shut
Idle thoughts spill constantly from open mouths.
With their eyes sewn shut

I hope this haunts you like this haunts me
B-sides and broken smiles wont dance with me
Dance with me

[Solo]

Idle thoughts spill constantly from open mouths
With their eyes sewn shut
Idle thoughts spill constantly from open mouths.
With there eyes sewn shut
