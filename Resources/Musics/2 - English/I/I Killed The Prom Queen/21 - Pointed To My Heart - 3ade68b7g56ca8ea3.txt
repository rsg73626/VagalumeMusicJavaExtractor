POINTED TO MY HEART

You close your tired eyes
 Some times you have to let go
 I feel these feelings as they tremble away
 You have said your good byes to me, in my memory
 This is just another fond farewell, for you to die with
 In another second
 I am left breathless
 In another moment
 I am left emotionless
 Come on
 
 These words are like poetry
 I look down as my wrists are slit I am still bleeding
 I look as my, my wrists are still bleeding
 I am so sorry, cause I am so sorry
 Why am I so sorry?
 Cause I am so sorry
 For what I have done
 
 Cause I am lost
 As this time fell apart
 
 I won't forget
 Cause I will not forget
 
 Cause as love is lose
 Well as love is lost
 Yet again I will bleed
