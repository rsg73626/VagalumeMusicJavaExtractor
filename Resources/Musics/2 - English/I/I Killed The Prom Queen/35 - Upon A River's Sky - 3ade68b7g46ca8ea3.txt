UPON A RIVER'S SKY

Rebellion of a drive prince afraid
 to turn to ask for help
 Even if you could see through my
 Falling apart to die why?
 And even if you could see through my eyes
 
 This time I will not be denied I'm seeing
 A better tomorrow this time
 I will not be denied, cry, die
 Today forever I will not be denied of this fate
 
 Blind, we are all blind
 
 The sixth demon he pulls his strings
 And he will see (me)
 
 Will acceptance, ever except, ever except me
 Confirm your blackness, swallow and smile
 You've killed me now, swallow and smile
