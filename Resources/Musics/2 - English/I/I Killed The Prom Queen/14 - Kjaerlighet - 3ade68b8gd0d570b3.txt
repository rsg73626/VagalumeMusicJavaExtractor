KJAERLIGHET

Across the ocean
These flames can't provide me with the warmth that I desire

The fire I need is a glimpse on the horizon
A beacon of hope, I'm coming home

Feels like I'm in another world (in another world)
If I walk too quickly I can almost fly
Cascading, enveloped, I can't escape this
Luminescence everywhere, light up the darkness

You are the cause of this sickness
And the cure for this disease
Bathe me in gold so that I may breathe again

You are the cause of this sickness
And the cure for this disease

I once was sun-kissed, now I lay frozen here
But the fire inside burns bright, adrenaline, oxycontin
Give me the strength to
Move heaven and earth
Realign us back in phase
I'll never leave again

You are the cause of this sickness
And the cure for this disease
Bathe me in gold so that I may breathe again
