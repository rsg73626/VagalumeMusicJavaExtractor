MY BEST WISHES

As despair is a distant memory
 Walk across the flame and burn yourself away
 As my throat's swollen when you're dead
 How can you continue to lie to yourself?
 
 As I glance back at you
 You continue to lie to me you have lied to me
 No matter how much blood is lost now
 Under a dying sky you are swept away
 
 You are so beautiful
 I felt safest in your arms
 On the brink of extinction
 Hands around my neck and turn to save me now
 
 As despair is a distant closure
 Walk across me body and kiss my lips
 Continue to beat me
 
 You are so beautiful
 
 Move yourself
 Step back from me
 Walk away from me
 Under a dying sky
 
 I felt safest in your arms, On the brink of extinction
 Hand around my necks and turn to save me now
 
 I hope you can hear my voice
 I have buried my own self - cause you lied to me
 As I whisper out for redemption
 I scream out for forgiveness
