BET IT ALL ON BLACK

You wore out your welcome like you wore me down to the bone
Outside the mood is absent and silence provides no solace
I offer no shelter from the dead night air
Just a tomb to call your own in this falling fortress

Awake me from this broken dream. 
Your god wont lead you through today
He only hears your cries as a curous to a lullaby
Your faith has fallen before your eyes. 
A mindless cage that keeps you suffocated
and on your knees, lonely, wanting more 

he preaches another love song
Temporarily blinded by lies 
you taken beauty from these words
Rewrite your own mind in this war.
you taken beauty from these words
Rewrite your own mind in this war.

You wore out your welcome like you wore me down
You are an image without form. 
and in this moment my heart collapsed
You smashed it apart. Apart

He preaches another love song temporarily blinded by lies.
He preaches another love song temporarily blinded by lies.

Everything you hold, Everything you hold, 
Everything you hold, Everything you hold, 
Everything you hold, in your heart is frail. 
Everything you love will pass away
Everything you hold your heart is frail
It will perish in a wall of flames
