DREAMS AS HEARTS BLEED

Through these eyes open to life (through these eyes) unfold.
Escape reality.
Unfolded blood thrown before me, do you see what I see.
Blood thrown before me, dreams killed by.
Star lit harmony.
As blood is thrown before me lost are those that don't believe that walk with.
There eyes shut.
Conclusion written in the blood.
Of the narrow minded why that I ask.
This is the only question that I ask.
