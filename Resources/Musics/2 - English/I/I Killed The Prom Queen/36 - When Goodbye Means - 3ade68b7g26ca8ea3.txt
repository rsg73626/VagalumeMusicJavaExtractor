WHEN GOODBYE MEANS

Forever Your icy breath will still warm my heart
I hate these suicide emotions that are left
As I feel your tears I bleed for you
Please stop this, stop this crying onto me
 
Your words are just an insult to me again
 
Another rumour is started
(Beautiful) I hear your beautiful voice
(Hope as) I will walk away crying
Beautiful voices forever will choke me down
 
I hope that you look me in the eyes, when I cry
Blink just for a second (Pondering)
Look into a mirror at someone that you hate
Sit back and watch, as the paint will dry
 
Check your vital signs (Check your vital signs)
As these hearts won't mend (As hearts won't mend)
As time will pass us by
You won't change as the sky burns me
 
Another lonely night will await me
 
As the sky will burn you apart
As the mirror turns you into someone that you hate
 
It was sixty seconds, since I met you
I'm dying and bleeding of my past
Wasting away. Wasting away from you
 
I watched you fall, I hope that you will break
Now burn with me and let me melt away
Now burn with me and watch me melt away

As this hope is forgotten
 
Hope forgotten, you're forgotten
