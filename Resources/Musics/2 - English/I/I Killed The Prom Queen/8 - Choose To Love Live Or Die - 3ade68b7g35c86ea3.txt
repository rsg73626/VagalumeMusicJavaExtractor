CHOOSE TO LOVE LIVE OR DIE

Dreams kill the image of the innocent that dies.
That a heart beats pure is blackened within her eyes.
Dreams kill the image of the innocent.
A one clear moment shows its unloved soul.
This one clear moment shows me its unloved soul.
This one clear moment shows its unloved soul.
This one clear moment shows me its love.
That I can not escape strong hold you pity me.
See the noose hung.
See through my eyes.
As I pity myself awoken dreams of a future here left to bleed my loves heartbeat is taken away.
My dreams forgotten, this is not my only wish for every love that's taken me,
For every pain that killed a dream.
For every love that's taken me, when every pain *DIES* every turn sculptures strength
(Self discipline is like tempered steel)
To kill me to hate me I cant understand this I cannot understand fate
Break the chains of a shackled mind.
For every pain that's taken me.
For every love that's killed a dream.
Break the chains and I wont shed these feelings.
For every pain that ever killed a dream.
