LIKE NAILS TO A CASKET

Too many times searching for mercy without sincere remorse
Look into these eyes forever holding doubt under masks of false comfort you wear so proud
And when the walls tear down the shell expose must head for the shadows

These bridges still smoldering
A dark veil shields the eyes but still your name carries in the wind
Know that I'll leave all compassion were it's due

At the foot of your headstone it's too late to rise from the ruin
The stench of death hangs in the air tonight
But if you come back I'll be waiting with an open casket

I'll be waiting with an open casket to bury you alive

Years of betrayal will stain the days ahead
I wish to sew the seeds of vengeance a single wish to end this rule
I wish I sew a seed of vengeance and let the sky be vacant
Years of betrayal stain the days ahead

I'll be waiting with and open casket to bury you alive
Watch the angels fall like flies
From the dead heavens above
