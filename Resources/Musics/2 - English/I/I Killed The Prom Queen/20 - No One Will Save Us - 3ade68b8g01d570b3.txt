NO ONE WILL SAVE US

When the world comes crashing down
Will you search the sky for safety
You can hope it's rain
And this is the sound of the end
I don't know what will save me

As our cries go unanswered
Will your hate get you past it

When your world comes crashing down
Do you look to tradition
Don't believe in flesh and blood
And live a life in fear of these visions

You're living in the shadows
Cast my doubt, believe in yourself (believe in yourself)

If you're cries go unanswered
Will your hate get you past it

Oh dear god, these are the darkest nights
How can we open their eyes
Oh dear god, this is my constant plight
When will they open their eyes
When will they open their eyes

Every word is a waste of breath
Every word falls on ears that are that are deaf

You're living in the shadows
Cast my doubt, believe in yourself
Stop living in the shadows
Free your mind and believe in yourself

Oh dear god, these are the darkest nights
How can we open their eyes
Oh dear god, these are the darkest nights
How can we open their eyes
Oh dear god, this is my constant plight
How can we open their... when will they open their eyes
