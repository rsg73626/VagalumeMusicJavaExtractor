TO THE WOLVES

Give us light

These are the demons we've created
They're selling us lies, heartache and hatred
It's time to sever the ties
And feed the raging fires
Because in the dark they'll give us light

Substance isn't an option they'll grace us with

A sincere word has never left your head
With sheep at your feet the stage is set
Your words could bring them life
But you'll leave them for dead

These are the paths that we have taken
If you think they're selling us truths, you're gravely mistaken
An aversion that never faded
It just grows to becomes so jaded
They are no better than us

Substance isn't an option they'll grace us with

A sincere word has never left your head
With sheep at your feet the stage is set
But you don't have a single heartfelt line to say

Oh
Your words could bring them life again
But you'll leave them for dead

You left us for dead

It's time we leave them behind
No need for goodbyes
