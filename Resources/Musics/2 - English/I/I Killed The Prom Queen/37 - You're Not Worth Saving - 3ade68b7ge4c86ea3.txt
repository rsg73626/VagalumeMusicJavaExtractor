YOU'RE NOT WORTH SAVING

To all my friends I'll die for you, This is the way I feel, It's in my blood.
Yesterday today and tomorrow.
This is in my heart Ill never change.
Memories will live forever in my heart.
Fuck the fakes who have fallen through the cracks of patheticness.
I'll never forget you.
I'll never change the way I feel.
You will always be a joke in my eyes.
To all the fakes I fucken hate you.
To all my friends I'll die for you.
This is our lives.
This is who we are.
