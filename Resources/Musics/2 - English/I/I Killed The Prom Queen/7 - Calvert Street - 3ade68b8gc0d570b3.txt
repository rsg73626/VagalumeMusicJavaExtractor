CALVERT STREET

My heart in your hands
If I had of known it would not come to this
We've grown and its not easy to let go
We fall apart my sentiment begins to distort

My hollow heart it still beats for you
Dragged through the dirt after all that we've been through

Your head in your hands
You should have known
I could never meet your demands
we fell apart
My sentiment began to distort

My hollow heart it still beats for you
Dragged through the dirt after all that we've been through

This wasn't meant for us
There was never a point to be lost
In one another we're left to discover
That our paths should have never crossed

I walk alone, endlessly
In time with the sound of sympathy
I walk alone, endlessly
in time with the sound of sympathy

Fuck it I'm letting go
I'm letting go

This wasn't meant for us
There was never a point to be lost
In one another we're left to discover
That our paths should have never crossed

I walk alone, endlessly
In time with the sound of sympathy
