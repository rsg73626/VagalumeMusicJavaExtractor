TO BE SLEEPING WHILE STILL STANDING

Slowly watching these dreams all die.
I cut my life away from you.
I remember happiness.
I see the evil in your eyes.
I see the beauty in a modern world.
Destruction.
I see shades of red blanketing your skies.
I'm still dripping still shedding these tears.
For what reason I don't know.
I still taste the bitterness, one million reasons to die Remember the times that we had.
The depths of forgotten.
Forget your past.
Look to the future.
Drowning in my sleep.
This is a fucking nightmare.
I hope the regret burns into my hands.
So I know what I've lost, I blame myself for our past.
I still remember happiness.
I'm still dripping with this blood.
I'm still shedding these tears.
I see the evil in your eyes I still dream about you.
I still die without you.
Still dreaming still dying.
Still sleeping while still standing.
