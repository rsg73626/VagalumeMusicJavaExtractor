THE DEEPEST SLEEP

I'll take you down to the waters edge
I'll take you down to the waters edge
I'll show you exactly what its like to feel alive
As you gaze up to the sky 
as your cold hands reach out for mine
I have forced myself to look away 
as all hope is Lost as you gaze up at the sky
I'll show you exactly what its like to feel alive
We'll paint it black and blue as a painful reminder of
The black heart that's beating inside you Bleeding inside you

Among the merciful, sin will reign 
only guilt will crush us all
And We will face the end, We'll find the deepest sleep 
in graves we dig ourselves

I'll make sure you never sleep again
The air around us has become a threat to swallow
These words are uttered in contempt and spat out like poison
I hope you rot down to the core

I hope you rot down to the core
I hope you rot down to the core

From many years of misery I'm torn in two
From many years of misery I'm torn in two
We'll paint it black and blue as a painful reminder of
The black heart thats beating inside you, bleeding inside you
We'll paint it black and blue as a painful reminder of
The black heart thats beating inside you, bleeding inside you

Among the merciful, sin will reign 
only guilt will crush us all
And We will face the end, We'll find the deepest sleep 
in graves we dig ourselves
