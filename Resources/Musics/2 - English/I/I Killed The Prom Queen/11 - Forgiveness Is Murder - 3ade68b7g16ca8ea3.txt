FORGIVENESS IS MURDER

Remember back when we were so close
Remember when we had all of this
Although we aren't close anymore
I will always remember you
 
Child hood reminders are forever
Plaguing my mind to function
This is a time forgotten yesterday
 
Forgiveness is denied
Saturday morning cold weather
Freezing me to death
Realising that nothing is left
Saturday morning cold weather
Freezing my to death
Nothing it left
YEAH
 
Realising that nothing is left
Realising nothing is left

You have failed me for too long
As your smile is broken down
 
You're smile is so broken away
You're crying eyes are wiped away dry
I know my weakness is your whispered lies
You are lying to me again
 
Remember me
