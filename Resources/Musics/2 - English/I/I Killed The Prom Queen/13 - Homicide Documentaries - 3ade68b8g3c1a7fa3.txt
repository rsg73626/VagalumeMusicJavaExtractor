HOMICIDE DOCUMENTARIES

For every word misspelt
For every knife that cuts you
Every rose has its thorn
To stab your heart

For every word misspelt
For every knife that cuts you
Every rose has its thorn
To stab your heart

I watched as beauty fades away
Drenched in tears she falls from grace
Again and again, the same old story burns
The taste of you in my heart
You have murdered me
In one second, attraction dies forever

I hope that your world will come back to kill you
In the next life you'll be the one that will die

I watch the drink as it falls from the table

I watched as beauty fades away
Drenched in tears she falls from grace
Again and again, the same old story burns
The taste of you in my heart
You have murdered me
In one second, attraction dies forever

You'll be the one thats lied to
You'll be the one that dies
You'll be the one thats lied to
You'll be the one that dies

In another life, you'll be the one that will die
In another life, you'll be the one that will die
In another life, you'll be the one that will die
In another life, you'll be the one that will die

I hope that your world will come back to kill you
In the next life you'll be the one that will die
