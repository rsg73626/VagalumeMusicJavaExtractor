SAY GOODBYE

Roar (low)
Roar (med)
Roar (high)


C'MON


Storm clouds hanging over head
Offer not the slightest bit of comfort
For the first time in days
I wait to discover
Disasters that I've slept through
While I felt so alive

So we say goodbye
So we say goodbye
Heartstrings severed just as quick
As they were discovered
So we say goodbye
So we say goodbye
I'll break my own fall, to keep you, picture perfect
Just don't wake me up now

Say goodbye
Close your eyes for the last time
(Say goodbye and close your eyes)
Questioning everything that went wrong
(Questioning everything that went wrong)

The silence she whispers to me
Telling me things we dare to speak out loud
The collaboration of the blinding sun
Through vacant streets hits home hard
Like a hatchet to the skull
I'd keep you here if you kept me warm
And these winters away
Your hands were the only hands needed to hold me
For the first time in days
I feel alive

In the end we'll both rot together
In the end we rot together,
Our love lies in embers.
In the end we'll both rot together
In the end we'll rot together,
Our love lies in embers.


Say goodbye
Close your eyes for the last time
(Say goodbye and close your eyes)
Questioning everything that went wrong
(Questioning everything that went wrong)

Peering out of those same cracked windows
That I studied for days upon days
Suddenly collapse
It all falls down
It all falls down.

Say goodbye
Close your eyes for the last time
(Say goodbye and close your eyes)
Questioning everything that went wrong
(Question everything that went wrong)

So say goodbye,
So close your eyes.
So say goodbye,
Say goodbye and close your eyes.
So say goodbye, 
so close your eyes, 
say goodbye and close your eyes, 
close your eyes

Tonight
