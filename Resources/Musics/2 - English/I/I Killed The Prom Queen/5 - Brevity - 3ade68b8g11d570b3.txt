BREVITY

Take your bow

Set yourself free
Set aside your differences and heal
Mend the holes in your heart, teach us how to feel
We're so fucking hopeless
We're so fucking hopeless

That's all they said over and over again
We don't think we are invincible
scared of failure
You're obsessed with the world you love so dear

Brevity
What are we living for

You will find me with my back against the wall... with my back against the wall

Live your life, see the world
What are you so afraid of

That's all they said over and over again
We don't think we are invincible
scared of failure
You're obsessed with the world you love so dear

Brevity
What are we living for

You will find me with my back against the wall... with my back against the wall

My eyes are so clear
I can finally see the world for what it really is
Rip the heart from the bone
You will live out your days on your knees
You'll never shed a tear
