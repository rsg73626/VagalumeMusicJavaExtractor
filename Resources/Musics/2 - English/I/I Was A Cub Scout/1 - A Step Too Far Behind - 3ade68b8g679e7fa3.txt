A STEP TOO FAR BEHIND

Tonight,
I will see you for the last time.
And when we part,
I doubt we'll ever speak again.

A step too far behind,
You're falling back into old habits.
The simplest of escapes,
That should never happened - and...

You've been left alone,
With the trouble you have caused,
So sing for your sins and hope that it can be enough.
You know I was wrong, and I know far too well,
So sing for your sins and hope that it can be enough.

A step too far behind,
Your first decision.
You can have whatever you like,
But it won't make it different.

A step too far behind,
Your final decision.
You could give me what I've never had,
But it could never make it different.

You've been left alone,
With the trouble you have caused,
So sing for your sins and hope that it can be enough.
You know I was wrong, and I know far too well,
So sing for your sins and hope that it can be enough.
