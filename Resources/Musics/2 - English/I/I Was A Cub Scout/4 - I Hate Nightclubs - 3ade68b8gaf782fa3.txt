I HATE NIGHTCLUBS

Are you thinking clearly?
'Cause i'm thinking clearly
I don't think that you know at all
Do you know what I see?
Do you know how I feel?
I don't think that you do at all.

So say what you want out loud
I'm struggling to listen to you somehow
So say what you want out loud
That's enough i've got to leave here right now

I think there's a problem
I think that that it needs to be solved
I don't think that you care at all
But in these situations
I cannot see, no
My problem's how you can un-solve

So say what you want out loud
I'm struggling to listen to you somehow
So say what you want you want out loud
That's enough i've got to leave here right now
