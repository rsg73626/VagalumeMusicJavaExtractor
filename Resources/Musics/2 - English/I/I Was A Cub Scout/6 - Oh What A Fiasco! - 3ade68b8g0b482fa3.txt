OH WHAT A FIASCO!

You had me then and you could have me now,
so take my hands i can't explain it.
i'd do anything you asked of me.
don't make a sound, just come along baby.

i saw you through the crowded streets,
and you looked beautiful to me.
one more night and then i'll be on top. (x2)

i would do anything to get you baby,
anything at all.
i lay around dazed and day dreaming.
i hope that next year won't be the same.

i saw you through the crowded streets,
and you looked beautiful to me.
one more night and then i'll be on top. (x2)

i can't believe anything anything tonight
and i cannot sleep until i feel alive
i can't believe anything anything tonight
and i cannot sleep until i feel alive
one more night and then i'll be on top.(x2)
