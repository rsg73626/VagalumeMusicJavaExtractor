OUR SMALLEST ADVENTURE

We find ourselves
Include this company
Spoke of things that we cannot repeat

We’ve trapped our tongues
And stumble while we’re in nine steps

And oh
How I know you best?
Beyond the trouble so mess?
And I’ll pass in every kind of
To find you

There are simple routes
We can follow
There’s so many things we can do
Oh, we’re all tired up
And oh so lost on the smallest adventures

Oh love belief
Oh, become incomplete
I’ll take this turns
From what I fell the worst
