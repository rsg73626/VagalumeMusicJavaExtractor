P'S AND Q'S

I put the pain in your neck
And you put the beat in my heart
I made a sound for your ears
And you make the words from my mouth

Now your a voice,
Sit and behave or ponder,
So i'm remembering, my p's and q's
As thats what you want me to

I'd like to see you proud,
I'd like to see you in the best of news,
I'd like to see you in my sight your highest highs,
because im close to you,

I'd like to see you proud,
I'd like to see you in the best of news,
I'd like to see you in my sight your highest highs,
because im close to

And time may have pulled us down,
but it wont pull us apart,

I'm alive, and you are kicking
I'm close to cold, and you are freezing,
The mindless shuffle of your feet, 
And the tiny chance when i look at you you feel close to me

I'd like to see you proud,
I'd like to see you in the best of news,
I'd like to see you in my sight your highest highs,
because im close to you,

I'd like to see you proud,
I'd like to see you in the best of news,
I'd like to see you in my sight your highest highs,
because im close to
