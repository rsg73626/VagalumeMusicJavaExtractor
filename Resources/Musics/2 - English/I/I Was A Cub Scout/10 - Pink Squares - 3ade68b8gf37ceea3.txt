PINK SQUARES

Don't the clocks turn back this evening,
Another hour for you to try and forget to try and correct your mistakes.
Yes i know i'm wrong but theres two sides to every story,
Baby we are not the same and we will never feel the same.

Oh oh oh am i in trouble darling i apologize,
I need you more then anything please come back with me tonight,
Oh oh oh i am in trouble darling i apologize,
I need you more then anything please don't ever leave my side.

These gentle twists these gentle turns we are getting awfully close,
I have my suspicions that somethings wrong,
You know i should of stayed and talked,
But oh i grabbed my shoes and i left the room singing oh oh oh what can i do,
Baby there is no need to hide.
Darling there is no need to fight

Oh oh oh am i in trouble darling i apologize,
I need you more then anything please come back with me tonight,
Oh oh oh i am in trouble darling i apologize,
I need you more then anything please don't ever leave my side.
