BEAR FUR

I hope I'm making perfect sense,
I hope I'm getting through.
These eyes that strain is alright,
'Cos baby its all for you.

Take steps, tiny steps, to meet me.
I missed you babe so badly.
So stay here in my arms,
for a few minutes, yeah,
before we both can make a mis-service,
yeah, tonight.

Understand me now,
I do not want to be left out.
It's time for things to change,
so stay stay stay awake.
I saw the words come straight out your mouth,
baby why'd you leave me out, tonight.
