SAVE YOUR WISHES

Whatever you want,
Wherever you are,
Whatever you need,
I'm not that far.
I cannot let my plans fall through,
And I'm a little worried about it all.
There's no boundries to what you could be capable of,
Is there anything else left to go wrong?
Is there anything else left to go wrong?

Save your wishes,
Cause they won't help you.
And keep your kisses,
Cause they're unwanted.

Short lived,
Not even a chance to slap.
Leave the brave or bar, it's meant nothing to anyone.
So I cross my fingers and I was replaced,
I was bought for a price and then...
Now back to back,
When you're who we are,
We mean nothing to anyone.

Save your wishes,
As they won't help you.
And keep your kisses,
As they're unwanted.

Save your wishes,
As they won't help you.
And keep your kisses,
As they're unwanted.
