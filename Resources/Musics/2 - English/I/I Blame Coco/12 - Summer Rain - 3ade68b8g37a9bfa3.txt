SUMMER RAIN

So tell me, have I lost it all
Have I lost the pain
Punch through a red brick wall
And feel the same

But to you, it's all the same
Just like a hunter only knows
What's its prey

Whatever's mine is yours
We share the blame
Just like the darkness is your mind
Is blind with shame

Do tell me, have you lost it all
Have you changed your name
It's funny how this loneliness
Can bring you fame

So, how can I trust you
Love me if you must be a fool
Here's the mic and here's your cue

Summer rain and Christmas tears
Holiday fiction and fear
Just roll of love, and golden years
'Cause daytime you might miss your life
I think I've missed mine

So tell me, did you get my calls
Did you hear the ring
Come from a showcase brawl
Just to hear me sing

So tell me, -?-
Would you be my king
It's funny what will buy your love
Will slowly bring

So, how can I trust you
Love me if you must be a fool
Here's the mic and here's your cue

Summer rain and Christmas tears
Holiday fiction and fear
If you just roll of love, and golden years
'Cause daytime you might miss your life

You should have known that I was trouble
You should have told by the look in my eye
You should be careful who you fall for
'Cause only one -?- and twice is too shy

So don't lie to me
I am your responsibility
So don't lie to me
Stay strong for me
Discover me, cuddle me
So here's to my sobriety

So, how can I trust you
Love me if you must be a fool
Here's the mic and here's your cue

Summer rain and Christmas tears
Holiday fiction and fear
Just roll of love, and golden years
'Cause daytime you might miss your life
x2
I think I've missed mine x2
