BOHEMIAN LOVE

Oh, how the birds awake before me?
They beat me every morning rise.
And now I'm lucky if I get a wink in,
Because there's something on my mind.

I miss your face.
I miss the places that I once knew,
I don't like this space.
This absent lays with insomnia.
I'm caught in bohemian love,
Bohemian love.

What happened to sleepy, humner? 
Who slept all day?
Bohemian love.
What happened to lazy, humner?
Who let the sunlight waste away?
What happened to brave bold courageous?
Humner, who was never afraid?
What happened to her?
Oh, what happened to me?

So back to my sleep,
I'm tossing and turning.
My appearance is cheap.
My daytime is small eyes and yawning.
Look at the bright side,
I don't have to make my bed in the morning.
Everytime I gaze at my pillow I cry.

What happened to sleepy, humner? 
Who slept all day?
Bohemian love.
What happened to lazy, humner?
Who let that sunlight waste away?
What happened to brave bold courageous?
Humner, who was never afraid?
What happened to her?
Oh, what happened to me?
