CONTROL

I've lost control
I've lost my soul
My heart's turned to coal
'Cause I've lost control

Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up on you
I've lost control
And I've lost my soul

Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up on you
Is that why you think I'm cool

How can this be wrong, babe
I hope that I can stay
Until my heart freezes sober
See, I just think we're drunk
Maybe we're caught in a car crash coma
Can we be drunk forever

I've lost control (I've lost control)
I've got your cold (I've got your cold)
Is that why they'll call us fools
Because I get fucked up on you
Is that why you think I'm cool

How can this be wrong, babe
I hope that I can stay
Until my heart freezes sober
See, I just think we're drunk
Maybe we're caught in a car crash coma
Can we be drunk forever

And now that I'm lost
I'll always wanna love you
And now that you're lost (by the way)
Do you love me too

And now that we're lost
I'll always wanna love you
Don't mind if I do

How can this be wrong, babe
I hope that I can stay
Until my heart freezes sober
So, why don't we just get drunk
Maybe we're caught in a car crash coma
Can we be drunk forever

I've lost control
I've got your cold
I lost my soul
Let's be lost forever

I've lost control
I've got your cold
Let's lose control
Let's be drunk forever
