HUMNER HUMNER

You still pretend like make believe
Like you have a cure for this disease
You play the part, I'll take the lease
Suffocation, I can't breathe

You show me how I'll cross the way
And we'll collide another day
What's the use is what they say
I can't be pleased so I'm afraid
So don't be late
Because the positive side of me never really stays for long
Oh, ho, just don't complain
'Cause when the sun comes outta me you never (x10) want to play

15 years is quite a lot
_____ coffee is all I've got
Come fly with me on top of trees
My fix is in, happy and free
What's the use, you're in my blood
You are the drug I can't give up
You be the needle I'll be the vein
Drive it through and I can't complain

You show me how I'll cross the way
And we'll collide another day
What's the use is what they say
I can't be pleased so I'm afraid
So don't be late
Because the positive side of me never really stays for long
Oh, ho, just don't complain
'Cause when the sun comes outta me you never (x10) want to play

My shining star
O, my guitar
Which one to choose, I must be smart
Feeling races to my heart
Love you darling, don't you start
Humner, humner's on the kill
All you Thompsons, pop that pill
O wasted girls, they sleepin' still
Bust out on the count of two

O hand, the needle comes in, the needle goes out
Just like the teacup and the spout
The needle comes in, the needle goes out
Just like the teacup and the spout

What's the use, you're in my blood
You are the drug I can't give up
You be the needle I'll be the vein
Drive it through and I can't complain
