2B 2D OR NOT 2B

It's another one of Coco's songs yes, and we're 'bout to get down
We're the artists in the world right now
Just touched down in kentish town

Like a balloon, she'll fly
A weightless character
Up, up away, so high
No elevating barrier

She never, she never, she never said goodbye
When they carried her home
Like a coward, she run
From a Chinese takeaway
High heels in one hand
As she dashed the tray away

Bon appetite
Was Greek you see
To a girl like she
To a girl like...

2B 2D or not 2B
All I know is that I want ya
And if you stay, I'll never leave ya
x2

Like a balloon she'll fly
As a balloon she'll fly
Like a balloon she'll fly
As a balloon she'll fly
When they carried her home
x2

You need to come by me
Fill your belly
You need to eat
I like to feed
Look at the pot, you said you're not hungry
You need to try my rice and peas

Come by me
Put on the weed
Munch like a champion
Drink some sweet tea
We'll both feel happy, fresh, and healthy
That's how a girl should be

2B 2D or not 2B
All I know is that I want ya
And if you stay, I'll never leave ya
