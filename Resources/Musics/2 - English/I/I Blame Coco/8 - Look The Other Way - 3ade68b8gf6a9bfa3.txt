LOOK THE OTHER WAY

I'll start my weekend
On Thursday night
And if you're keepin' up
Then I'll keep up time
But don't be sleepin'
Well, I won't mind
Seeing as there's more for me to get high

But no peeking
Because tthe playâ€™s shy
But no one likes a creeper
But I like your smile
Your drink is weaker
You got too much ice
You're gonna dance with me tonight

It don't get better than this

'Cause you'll see it's
My way, my way
Or look the other way, the other way
'Cause it's my way, my way
Or look the other way

Oh, look you're look you're look you're ugly
You're just like me
But if you love me
In your country

Well it's my way, my way
Or look the other way, the other way

It don't get better than this

You little weakling
It looks like you might die
But if you got a sheepskin
And a nine inch knife
And don't be keepin', keepin' up the wine
So there's more for us to get high

It's so deep in swimming in the river Nile
Your eyes are leaking
And you just want to run a mile
I'll bring the heat in
So you can stay a while
And you can dance with me tonight

It don't get better than this

One day you'll see that it's
My way, my way
Or look the other way, the other way
'Cause it's my way, my way
Or look the other way

Oh, look you're look you're look you're ugly
You're just like me
But if you love me
In your country

Well it's my way, my way
Or look the other way, the other way

It don't get better than this

So believe me
If you leave me
Next time you see me
You'll be bleeding
So believe me
Don't look the other way x7

Well than you'll see that it's
My way, my way
Don't look the other way, the other way
'Cause it's my way, my way
Or look the other way

Oh, look you're look you're look you're ugly
You're just like me
But if you love me
In your country

Well it's my way, my way
Or look the other way, the other way

'Cause its my way, my way
Or look the other way, the other way
