I BLAME COCO

Well how did all these people get in my room
I don’t know
Who spilled the talcum on the table
I think it’s time for you to go
It’s time to go
I blame, I blame Coco

Well how did all these people get in my room
I still don’t know
Who’s getting hot rocks on the sofa
It’s burning Chesterfield, you know
Yet it’s time to go
And I blame Coco

It’s getting late I’m tired
But Jasmine wants to dance
It’s getting light outside
Oh oh oh

It’s getting late I’m tired
Jasmine wants to dance
It’s getting light outside

Well how did all these people get in my room
I still don’t know
Who spilled the brandy on the table
I blame the bloke
It’s time to go and I blame Coco

It’s getting late I’m tired
But Jasmine wants to dance
It’s getting light outside
Oh oh oh

It’s getting late I’m tired
But Jasmine wants to dance
It’s getting light outside

My parents got back early
What will my mother say
Who ashed upon the sterling
That was my father’s nickname
My parents got back early
So what do I say
So what do I say
So what do I say

My parents got back early
What will my mother say
Who ashed upon the sterling
That was my father’s nickname
My parents got back early
So what do I say
All I can say to them is

It’s getting late I’m tired
And Jasmine wants to dance
It’s getting light outside
Oh oh oh

It’s getting late I’m tired
But Jasmine wants to dance
It’s getting light outside

We always do
I blame Coco
I always do
I blame Coco
Oh oh oh
I blame Coco
I always do
I blame Coco
We always do
I blame Coco

Oh oh oh oh
