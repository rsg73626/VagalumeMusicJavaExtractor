NOAH'S ARC

My clothes are on inside out
I walk to the ceiling looking down
I turn to the left when the train turn right
Why do we have to love not fight?

Your words to me are like darts on the wall
They stick but sooner or later they'll fall
Why do you always have to go
And leave me here, all alone?

We ride this ship called Noah's Ark
We sail from dusk through day 'til dark
a merciless vessel we've made our mark
While you and I ignite this spark

Your words to me are like darts on the wall
They stick but sooner or later they'll fall
Why do you always have to leave
And suffocate this air I breathe?
