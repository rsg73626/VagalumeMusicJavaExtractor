NO SMILE

Have you ever got a smile
That you know you'd always love it
See, even if it vomits bile
You'd only miss it

It turns upside down and cries
And you just want to kiss it
I get the feeling from your eyes
This time you won't dismiss it

From a seven storey building
I think of you (oh oh oh)
Obsessive minds like mine
Are speed dialing you

Fragments of your face
Race around my lonely place
And I jump for you

Got no time to waste
'Cause there's no smile here
x2

'Cause I promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you
Until the ends of time
x2

Oh x10
I need you in sickness
I need you in health
I need you on my guest list
I need you by myself

So be apart forever
Baby boy, you're mine
But nothing lasts forever
So instead I'll take my life

Got no time to waste
'Cause there's no smile here
x2

'Cause I promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you
Until the ends of time
x2

I love you but there's no smile here x2
I love you but there's no smile

I love you but there's no smile here x3
I love you but there's no smile
