YET REJOICE

Praise the Lord, O my soul!
Do not faint within me
Do not grow cold
Praise the Lord, O my soul!
Forget not all He's done
Nor what He's told
You You

Yet rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
Remember His goodness
Yet rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
Stand firm on His goodness
And the hope that you lost
Is restored by His promise

When your joy breathes its last, He gives
Life in abundance
And the tears that fell fast
Are soaked up by His kindness
When your courage hangs worn, He grants
Strength in abundance
