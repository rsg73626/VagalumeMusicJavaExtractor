WILLIAM SHATNER SPEAKS ESPERANTO, DO YOU?

The year is 1953 and he is twenty-two years old
He's finding his true calling, his true destiny
A language never heard on the Continent as such:
A mixture of French, Polish, Portuguese, and Dutch
Last night he had a dream and so he called me on the phone
He asked me if I knew what his name was
I said "Bill" and then asked "Why?"
He said because he had forgotten it
I said he was better off without it
William Shatner! Bill Shatner!
