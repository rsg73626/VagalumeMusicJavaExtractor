FIGHTING IS EMO

Pack your things in the car now, let's go
Waiting in line is for chumps, not me
Scan the crowd for the dorks and the crew
Roll with the punches
Where is your control?
Fighting is emo
Rock on, Chicago
Irrational with every blow
Fighting is emo
Where did your conscience go?
Watch your step if you value your life
Why don't you put your backpack away?
Take a look at me and someday you'll see
What you really want to be,
And how it's going to be a long haul
But this time you'll see why you keep your thoughts on the outside/inside
This time you'll see where you've come up wrong
And next time we meet keep your guns on the inside/outside
Next time we meet, try not to speak to me
