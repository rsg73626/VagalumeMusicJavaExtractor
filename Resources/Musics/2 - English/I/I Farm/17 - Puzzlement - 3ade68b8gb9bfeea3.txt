PUZZLEMENT

Thought of what you said
Tried to understand
Went back to my house and fought myself to sleep
We got lost, I don't know how
I just know you're giving up
Drain the excess from the swell in my head
Fell out and made my bed
I don't feel like me
We got lost, I don't know how
I just know I'm fucking up
We got lost, I don't know how
I just know you're giving up
It's too much to see right now
It won't work if we're out of luck
