THE DREADED ESQUALAX

Pulling teeth nearly swallowed
Pinched a nerve
Squashed a knee
Scratched my tongue at the bottom of my throat
Common sense is not in me
So why the long faces and sad songs and woeful regrets?
Just sit and suffer
Lost my lunch in the freefall
I taste my own blood mixed with cream cheese
My timing slows as the rocks loom in close
A splash of cold signs I fail
So why the long faces and sad songs and woeful regrets?
Just sit and suffer
And see you react
Hats off to the ones who don't fold
So I'll see you again
I bet you've never felt so cold
Then you'll act like a friend
It's nice until the end
Why do they all use the same words to try to comfort me?
What's wrong?
Visitors only seen once before
What is their motivation here?
You seem so far away, even though you're right here
Can you see the end in sight?
No need to feel alone,
Just go out and make a new home
Its common sense you'll find
