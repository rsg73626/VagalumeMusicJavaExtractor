IF WE CAN'T POLICE OURSELVES, THEN I GUESS WE NEED POLICE

The beasts across the way are just as scared of you
But they will drown you in your own words
Those words are hard for me to say:
That I don't trust you (anymore) in any way
It's time you faced your own irresponsibility
The things you think are far less grand
The beasts across the way are just as scared of you
If you ignore them, they will turn and go away
These words are hard for me to say:
That I don't trust you (anymore) in any way
They call it a nightstick but they club you with it
