LIFE ON PLANET REEBOK

Wake up at six
Synthetic speaker morning with:
Low protein gruel
Drape the world in raver-flage
It's always been easier to create
All trained to kill the thought with the word
Cursed frozen tundra wasteland
Devoid of the air-pump yet
Get them working while they're younger
Let's go again
Lunch served at twelve
Add the fancy racing stripes
Work until four
Dinner at six
Fighting by eight
In bed by ten
