END? NO ... 5.5

What's in front is not true
I think I'll take a step outside,
Take a look at the meat shell
If I listen harder I know I'd see better,
Or vice versa
What the hell am I talking to?
It has nothing to say
Frustration is pointless
(Everybody knows this)
Frustration is pointless
(Nobody knows this)
All this talk holds nothing
There is more than we see
All along I've known this
There is more than I see
There is more than we see
My skills need sharpening
