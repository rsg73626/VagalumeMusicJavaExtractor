R. FARM

All you do is sit around and talk
Could you wait until this is over?
I can't hear so just let be
Photographs of people I don't know,
Sweethearts and teachers, cousins and chimpanzees
The brick wall is only a fa√ßade
There are some things that matter,
And no time for things I won't see
Sailing home past sirens off the beach
Their songs are hypnotic
I'm useless and atrophied
I'm sorry I came off the wrong way
I'm better than this
I'm better than this
So I'll smile when they talk and think somewhere else
I'll think of the things I love and hate
All because I still want to be here
