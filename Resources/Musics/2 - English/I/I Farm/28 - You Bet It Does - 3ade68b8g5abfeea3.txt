YOU BET IT DOES

Last night I did something weird
I watched a tape of myself watching Temptation Island II
Full of pop-psychology and pop-philosophy
And even some pop-physics in there, too
Smart is the new smart
But dumb is the new brilliant
Maroon is the new red
Five is the new four
Why did you dumb down the dumb?
Why did you lower the bar?
Does it matter?
