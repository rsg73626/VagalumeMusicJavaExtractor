WHITE LIE

I can see the headlines
I can hear their words said
Words said repeating echoes no meaning sound
The headlines this evening:
"This fight is enduring."
What can you say?
Say to those who never question or let go,
Of their powerful, yet unknown foes
Too small, too weak
Things seem too bleak
To challenge despite ridicule
To challenge elephants and mules
A little white lie
So many in sorrow
Worth "X" in dollars
But that's why I'm here,
To scream and sear at my peers
Words said repeating echoes no meaning sound
A little white lie
