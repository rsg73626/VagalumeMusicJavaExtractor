WILLS FROM WITHOUT

While you analyze and frustrate your heart is let down
On this timeline or fault line in a timequake you'll drown
What you make is not what's made
Wills from without will pound
Before I set out it always comes to me, my successes
Without struggle or misery
But that's not what existence sees,
And that's not my faulty history
And that's not what the passion sees
And that's not my faulty history
