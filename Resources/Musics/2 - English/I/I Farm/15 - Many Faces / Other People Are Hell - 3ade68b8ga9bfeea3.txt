MANY FACES / OTHER PEOPLE ARE HELL

I know you know
Don't play the idiot
Your guess is I'm not at home
But you're clear like car windows
Watch it pile up till we can't see
Engulfed in crust too thick to bust clean
Secret talks behind the back of each other
And no one stops unless we're caught
Other people are hell
This is not my dream
Other people are hell
A little birdie told me
Other people are hell
Exposed emotions are hard to hide
Other people are hell
Learn to laugh or sit and cry
