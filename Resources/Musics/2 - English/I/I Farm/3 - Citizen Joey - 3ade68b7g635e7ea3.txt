CITIZEN JOEY

In the great Finger Lakes, in the Great White North. 
A candidate for city council run forth. 
When Joey's elected, the world is perfected. 
He dosnt snort coke and he dosnt shoot dope. 
If Joey's elected and bee's are infected. 
He'll take just one a day to sweep them away. 
Down on the Commons where the cops are the rule, 
he clucks and he struts and he acts like a fool. 
When Joey's elected, the world is perfected. 
He dosnt snort coke and he dosnt shoot dope. 
If Joey's elected and bee's are infected. 
He'll take just one a day to sweep them away. 
He just cant sit still, he paces and plods. 
He measures the world with his earth shaking bobs. 
When Joey's elected, the world is perfected. 
He dosnt snort coke and he dosnt shoot dope. 
If Joey's elected and bee's are infected. 
He'll take just one a day to sweep them away. 

[Spoken:]

When Joey's elected, the world is perfected.
