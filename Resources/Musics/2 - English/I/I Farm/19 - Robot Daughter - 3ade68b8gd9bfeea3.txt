ROBOT DAUGHTER

The Lord doesn't work in mysterious ways,
But I do in my basement
I'm really bad at these Parent-Teacher Conferences
I don't understand what you don't understand
You've never seen a walking fax machine?
And I'll bet you a dollar she could beat the crap out of your human daughter
I'm sorry; I'm just really bad at these conferences
It's really hard when you love someone so much
And I know you think she should repeat the third grade
But it's kind of hard to be hard hearted when you can hear her heart beat hard
