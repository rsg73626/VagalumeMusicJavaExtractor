IF VANS COULD RUN ON CLICHÃ‰S

Drowning in too much black coffee
Beneath ten thousand cigarettes
On two too many gin and tonics
You know that would never be enough
This excess is expected
No more food for a week?
Gelatin is made from horses
You know that would never be enough
This script has no arc; the characters are dull
Your life is a shitty movie
Your causes are becauses
Your accusations fail
But you are the only (renewable) energy resource that we have left
Cough up all that black shit
And spit it in the tank
Five hundred miles to the gallon
You know that would never be enough
You want to be so damn rock and roll
You're going to be so damn rock and roll
