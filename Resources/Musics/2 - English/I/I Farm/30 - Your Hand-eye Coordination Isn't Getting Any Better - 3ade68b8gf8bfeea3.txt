YOUR HAND-EYE COORDINATION ISN'T GETTING ANY BETTER

So you scrimp and you save all your dollars for quarters
March to the arcade, you can't pause, you can't save
The levels are harder, it's getting expensive
You spend your whole day and that's how they get you
The stories get darker, the companies smarter
Nintendo helps bring the arcade to your home
The games are so easy, you buy more and more
No consequences and that's how they get you
So hopefully we've learned where all the power lies
It's not skill, it's not brain, they let you win or save your game
But your hand-eye coordination is probably much worse
Helping is hurting, and that's how they get you
