CHEMOTHERAPY

It's so sad
I saw you with your man the other day,
He held your hand,
It fit like a glove
One and one complete, but one is complete
Two is company
It's so pathetic
And now I see it's just your insecurity
Your wants and your needs
It's so sad that you could lose yourself
So take the cure, even if it makes you bleed
And it's not easy
You know you said it yourself
It's just another Monday
She's just so afraid to leave him,
To sleep alone
She needs no one
She's just so afraid, but that part you know
She's just killing time on her own
Why not just leave him
