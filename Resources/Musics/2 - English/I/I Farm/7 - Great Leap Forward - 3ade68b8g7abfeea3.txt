GREAT LEAP FORWARD

This ain't no New Deal
And FDR is dead
There is nobody to look up to
And it seems like everything is worse than it ever was before
You can spend too much time,
Thinking you were born at the wrong time
But the time it takes to do that,
Doesn't seem like time well spent
They had a great leap forward in China
I heard a lot of people died
But it's still a name
The name that names this song
