MOUSE HUNTER, A.D

I learned a lesson today
And I can tell you it's the same
You just won't believe me because you work more
Stick to the plan
It's not how many words you know
It's how you use them
The hardest things to do are what you can and should
When you get respect you should wear it well
It's a badge of courage
Try not to turn it into bullshit
Everything gets fucked and then there's no one to deal with it
The hardest things to do?
Not talking yourself out of the things you can and should do
When you make something someone's problem to solve
It comes back worse than yours
Following confusion leads to this:
Brief moments of glory causing inabilities within ourselves
To take command makes sense and are not manipulative
