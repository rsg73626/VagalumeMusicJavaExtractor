SHUT UP AND READ

Cram a cork in it now
Or sew this death trap shut
Before I choke on my two feet
I'm too full to eat them
It dilutes my critical judgment
False accusations grow falser when fed
Impairing my ability to operate machinery
Clarity lies in the power of silence
Explaining excuses will not suffice
It's not the sound of one hand clapping
It's sticking a fork in it when it's done
When it's worthless I don't want to be there
Move swiftly or slowly burn
The road signs ahead scream "Dead End"
But it's hard to drive with your foot in your mouth
And you don't seem to notice
I hear your voice, it doesn't make any sense
Uneasy, we are;
Chemicals cause mood shifts
Unattractive, we are;
When we're full of shit
Cram a cork in it now
Or sew this death trap shut
Before I choke on my two feet
Move swiftly or slowly burn
