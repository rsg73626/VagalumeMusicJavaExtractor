HALF SANDWICH

To see myself, my former self,
Is that me or is this me?
Fall away and slip right out like I don't care
Or get back up
Apologies seem not quite fair
Childish words and selfish thoughts
Take it all till I get caught
Is this gambit awaiting me?
In twenty years I'll see or more
No solutions do I see
Save a slow road to maturity
Well I woke up feeling sorry for my own
Our elders, they have been right where I used to be
Fall away and slip right out like I don't care
I'll get back up
Apologies seem not quite fair
Childish words and selfish thoughts
I'll take it all till I get caught
