BUILD ON ONE

Saved up, wound tight tension
Acidic stomach well set in
I can see there's something wrong
We just can't say what
It might be imagination overblown
Stress builds on stress
I can see there's something wrong
We just can't say what
It never stops-
It never stops running out
From jealousy to discontent
Turn into stupid human tricks
Like tribes I've read will drill their heads
Just to release
