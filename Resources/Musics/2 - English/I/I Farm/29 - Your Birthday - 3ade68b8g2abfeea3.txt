YOUR BIRTHDAY

You went to any restaurant you wanted
Because it was your birthday
You ordered anything you wanted
Because it was your birthday
You didn't pay for lunch the next day
Because it was your birthday
Lots of smiles around the office
Because it was your birthday
I hope I never see my next one
Because it was your birthday
We did all we could and then some
Because it was your birthday
That's how you make us feel when it is your birthday
