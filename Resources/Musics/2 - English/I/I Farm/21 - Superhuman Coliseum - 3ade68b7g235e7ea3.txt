SUPERHUMAN COLISEUM

Live again, and start all over
It's never the same; the same as you
Live again and see no end
Leave your other single world
Live again, and start all over
Assigned seating in this cage
Where nothing can hurt you
What makes you think you'll live forever?
How much is your life worth?
Peace of mind and corporate perks
Clear your mind of waste and start all over
Live again, and start all over
Never again; again for them
Live again and see no end
Leave your other single world
Live again, and start all over
