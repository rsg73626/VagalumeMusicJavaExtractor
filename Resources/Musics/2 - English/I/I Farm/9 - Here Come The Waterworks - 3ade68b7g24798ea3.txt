HERE COME THE WATERWORKS

You think that I know and you know that I think,
But sometimes I think you hardly think at all
But if you think I'll think what you think that you know
I'll tell you I fight to win
I think that I know that you think that I know,
That I know that you fight to fight
I think that I know that you fight to fight,
One false move, and here come the waterworks
Are T.V. judges the wisest among us?
I don't know, I've never met one
I've studied and rehearsed and answered my questions,
And that's how I know I will always win
You think that I know and you know that I think
But sometimes I think you hardly think at all
If you think that I'll think that you think that you know,
I think that you don't know
But if you think that I'll think what you think that you know
One false move, and here come the waterworks
If there is no afterlife, then there is nothing worth dying for
You've got a good head on your shoulders, so use it
