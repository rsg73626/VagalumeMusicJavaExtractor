I KNEW YOU WERE TROUBLE

You can bet you life on it 
This couldn't happened to anybody else 
I knew you were trouble 
I knew you were trouble 
When you walk in the night I nearly died 
I should have hit the ground running 
Go anywhere else 
I knew you were trouble 
But I had to find for my self 

I shook your hand and gave you a beer 
Well its funny how these things start 
Slid in between you and your date 
Even though he is a mate of mine 
He just shrugged and stepped aside 

You can bet your life on it 
This couldn't happen anywhere else 
I knew I was in trouble 
I knew I was in trouble 
When you came back stage 
Oh god it feels so contrived 
I should have hit the ground running 
Go anywhere else 
I knew you were trouble 
But i had to find out for myself 

You claimed that you have given us up 
Don't need any more tunes about you 
But honey im no Marvin Gaye 
Or even Barry White 
Or Prince 
I just need a little more time 

You must be some kind of a joke 
Cause we've been laughing laughing laughing 
For hours 
It feels so easy 
But its so inconvient 
But i guess it out of hangs 

You can bet your life on it 
This couldn't happened to anybody else 
We knew we were in trouble 
We knew we were in trouble 
When you lead me down the stairs 
I followed you home 
But I should have hit the ground running 
Go anywhere else 
I knew you were trouble 
But i had to find for myself 
Had to find out for myself
