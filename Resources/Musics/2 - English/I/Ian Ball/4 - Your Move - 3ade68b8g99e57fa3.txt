YOUR MOVE

You move me, you move me
Not everybody does
I care about all of you
Not everybody would

My love, she's better the rest
My love, she knows better than the rest

You see through me, see through me
Not everybody does
I care about all of you
Not everybody could

It's your move, I made mine
After six months of going back and forth
And losing my memory
Nearly losing my mind

You're better than the rest
My love, you know better than the rest
My love, she knows better than the rest

It's war if she ever finds out
It's war if she ever finds out
It's war if she ever finds out
It's war if she ever finds out
It's war if she ever finds out
It's war if she ever finds out

You soothe me, you soothe me
Not everybody does
I care about all of you
Not everybody could

It's your move, I made mine
After six months of going back and forth
And losing my memory
Nearly losing my mind

You're better than the rest
My love, she knows better than the rest
My love, she's better than the rest

It's war if she ever finds out
It's war if she ever finds out
The war must be over by now
The war must be over by now

The war must be over by now
The war must be over by now
The war must be over by now
The war must be over by now
