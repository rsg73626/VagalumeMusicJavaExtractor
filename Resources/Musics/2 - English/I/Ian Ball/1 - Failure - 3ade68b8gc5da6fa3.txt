FAILURE

She was the first I ever knew
Came from the mainland on the east side
She said, "Don't follow me, dont follow me. You'll get lost. 
If you follow me, if you follow me, you'll get lost."

She's not your regular Mrs. Robinson
She got him drunk so she could sneak out the hotel
I played her a song, I got it all wrong 
It sounded like, 'Easy Lover'

Well, she laughed and she smiled
Didn't look like the type who'd like Genesis

She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down"
She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down"
She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down
'Cause it happens to the best of us" 

She asked me which way I wanted to go
I was too young to know the difference
When she showed me a trick
I couldn't handle it, I was too nervous
So she gave me a wink,
Said I would thank her for it, in the future 
When the other girls are linin' up

Don't let a little failure get you down
She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down"
She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down"
She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down"
She said, "Hey, don't let a little failure get you down"
She said, "Hey, don't ever let the failure get you down
'Cause it happens to the best of us"
