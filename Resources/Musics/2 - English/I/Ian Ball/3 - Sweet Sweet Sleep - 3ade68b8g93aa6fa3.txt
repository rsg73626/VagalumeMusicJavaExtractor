SWEET SWEET SLEEP

If I ever get caugh in the usual situation
Of champagne taste and big pocketbook
I would spend all I own without any reservation
Then get some sweet, sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet, sweet sleep

I remember the time when I was in your position
And though I was younger than you, you're alwas in control
You see the world is a sea of possiblity

And you go in deep, deeper than deep. Yes you were deeper than deep, deep sleep
You send the riot squad in, deeeper than deep, deep sleep
You never turn on me, deeper than deep, deep sleep

Cause it's the lonely, it's the lonely life
Baby, you get more out of it, if you put some more into it
It's the feeling, the feelings not right
If I wasnt so out of it, I'd put some more into it
If I wasnt so out of it, I'd put some more into it
I would... it's never enough, it's never enough

If you ever wake up and everybodys changed direction
Would you go with the flow, or let them wash you away
If i know you, youd never move your foundation

And you go in deep, deeper than deep, yes you were, deeper than deep, deep sleep
You send the riot squad in, deeeper than deep, deep sleep
You never turn on me, deeper than deep, deep sleep
You send the riot squad in, sweeter than sweet

sleep, sleep, sleep...
