DISTANCE MAKES THE HEART GROW

ive seen the west coast
ive seen the theme parks of the east
these eyes do more than seeing
they take a mental photograph to keep. ill share it with you
so you can write it down, these squares hold more than numbers
each one has a story to tell it all

now live your life (dont forget to feel alive tonight)
until i see you again (please carry us away tonight)

from the depth
of my own heart
i promise you its not the end
now live your life till isee you again
carry on til we meet up at the same place
i left you but ill wait for you
