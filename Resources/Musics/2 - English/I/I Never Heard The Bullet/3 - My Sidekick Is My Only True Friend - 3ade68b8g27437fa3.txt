MY SIDEKICK IS MY ONLY TRUE FRIEND

step up, let it out its all in your hands
think past, anything thatll make you change
all of, the money in the world
cant make you change

let me be the first but i wont be the last one to say
you can write the songs climb up the charts, but dont fall down

the spotlights on, in shines on you
lets see who you really are
and when it goes does the mask go too?
youre only fooling yo

so take that cash aside
the real jackpot is in your mind
when youve reached the top
dont forget where you came from

the image thats portrayed of our music we hear everyday
noones doing nothin new, its all the same
youve got so much to show so let it go
