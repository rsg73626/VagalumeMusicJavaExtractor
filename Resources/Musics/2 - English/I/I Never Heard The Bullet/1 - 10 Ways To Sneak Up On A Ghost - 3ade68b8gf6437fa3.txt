10 WAYS TO SNEAK UP ON A GHOST

this might hurt just a little bit, more for me than for you
if you would just take a little sip
maybe more let it all run through and ease the pain
i can make this so quick, like a bandaid rip it of your arm
this death is handmade full of all the charm that you see standing before you

breathe in slowly i wont make this hurt more than it needs to hurt you
if you listen to my words then itd be best if you just dont make a sound

so find a happy place cuz its your only place
where you wont have to face this tragic ending of
2 hearts but 1 backed down, it turns the whole thing around
all that were fighting for is now falling fast.

now did that hurt just a little bit, not that much you just wait
cuz i am just getting started, soon youll be on your knees begging to stop

dont make a sound until your eyes roll back
