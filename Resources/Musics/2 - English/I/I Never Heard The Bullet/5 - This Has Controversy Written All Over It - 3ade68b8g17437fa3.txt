THIS HAS CONTROVERSY WRITTEN ALL OVER IT

I am not a preacher, nor a messenger of god
got a mind of my own you couldnt touch it if you
tried
now do us all a favor and not waste our precious time
let's give them what they paid for, maybe later we can
define...

what makes you the one to speak for and getting in
their way
step aside and let them find themselves

what makes you think were movin forward, youre moving
forward?
and when we finally do someone tries to change your
mind

before you start to judge me or the meaning of this
song
wont you ask  me where ive been and id be happy to sit
down
and talk about the way my faith got crumbled to the
ground
then growing up and picking up the pieces that i
found

whether its a cross, crescent or a star remember who
you are
you can change the world one at a time, first starting
with yourself
