STRIKE THREE

here is where you have crossed the line
even if it kills me
one day you will see

like the boy who cried wolf
lies rolled off the tip of his tongue
till he couldnt speak anymore

as for me this is how it goes this is how it goes

baby see your shady ways
has caused this to crumble down
all trust is gone without a trace
strike 3 youll sit this out

right back to the arms you thought thatd make you feel like gold?
youll never find them theyve been sold
youre screaming in a soundproof room
best wishes to you

you call this living on the edge?
try approaching me face to face

how can i expect to believe that all your words mean a damn thing
when all i hear are easy lies followed by rehearsed cries

one day youll see trust dont come free
(so well say it till you prove that you are understanding me)
