WHERE DID YOU GO?

Where did I go?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?

I'm a wanderer, walk on any road
Give me a little love, not a way home
And oo, I'm an animal, fighting to carry on
Yes I'm a rebel, don't be afraid, no
Everywhere I'm looking all the loves gone away
Everybody's acting so cold
Ordinary people there all looking the same, to me
How do I stay? When theres nothing left to feel
Look at this face! And I pretend that it's not me!

Where did I go?

Where did I go?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?

Call me a criminal, cuz I done some wrong
Learned my lesson, I'm not sorry though
Keep on moving, straight for tomorrow
Yeah I'm an outlaw, I'm already gone
How do I stay? When theres nothing left to feel?
Look at this face! And I pretend that it's not me!

Where did I go?

I'm a wanderer, walk on any road
Give me a little love, not a way home
How do I stay? When theres nothing left to feel?
Look at this face! And I pretend that its not me!
