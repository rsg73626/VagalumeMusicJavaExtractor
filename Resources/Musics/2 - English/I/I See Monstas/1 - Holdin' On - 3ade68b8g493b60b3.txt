Broken footsteps on the floor
Pick myself up and carry on
Cause something's waiting for me
And I won't let them wreck my soul
Keep my direction
And soon I'llï»¿ be turned to gold
I'm a king without a throne
A heart without a home
Just cards that I've been dealt in life
I walk the road alone
But my hope will never die

I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'

And I'll face every hurricane, yeah
Get a sturdy
So I'll end that reign
I'm a king without a throne
A heart without a home
Just cards that I've been dealt in life
I walk the road alone
But my hope will never die

Yeah, I keep holding!
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
I keep holdin' on
I keep, I keep
I keep holdin'
