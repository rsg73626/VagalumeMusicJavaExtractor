MESSIAH

I'm waiting here for you
Singing my song to you
I'll testify the truth
MM

'Cause you called out to me in the middle of the night
Got down on my knees and so wide-eyed
The rivers are deep and the mountains I climbed
So high, so high

And I wait here for you
I got the faith

So come and take me higher, higher
Take me home, take me higher, yeah
And give me the way to believe
Be my Messiah, yeah

Baby let me rise up
Come and take me higher
And give me the way to believe
Take me home

You sent your love for me
Now I know what it means
Oh brother can't you see
How it is

You called out to me and I followed all the lights
Now the shadows have gone from the dark side
Got my feet on the ground as I reach for the sky
For life, for life

So come and take me higher, higher
Take me home, take me higher, yeah
And give me the way to believe
Be my Messiah, yeah

Baby let me rise up
Come and take me higher
And give me the way to believe
Take me home

I know the way to go
I got a way to go
I know the way to go home

I know the way to go
I got a way to go
I know the way to go home

I know the way to go
I got a way to go
I know the way to go home

I know the way to go
I got a way to go
I know the way to go home
(I got a way to go home, yeah)
(I got a way to go home)

So come and take me higher, higher
Higher
Take me home, take me higher
Higher
So come and take me

Higher
Higher
Baby let me rise up
Give me the way to believe
Take me home

Come and take me higher
