NEXT GREAT AMERICAN TRAGEDY

Come now, lets take the parade route to the cinema for our American Cousin. 
Hurry! Hurry! Don't miss the show.

You're falling like two twin towers. 
Am I nothing to you but a hijacked plane? 
Can your levee not take the pressure? 
Everything is flooding. Don't fall adrift.

Please don't back out now. 
Or I might go into a great depression. 
I hope this blackout sets the mood. 
Don't let this fall into a recession.

I have some plans in Dealey Plaza that we simply can not miss. 
I was planning fireworks by the harbor. 
The harbor and the bombs just might start to kiss.

You're falling like two twin towers. 
Am I nothing to you but a hijacked plane? 
Can your levee not take the pressure? 
Everything is flooding. Don't fall adrift.

Your falling like two twin towers. 
Can your levee not take the pressure? 
And when everything is flooding. 
Don't fall adrift. I have a dream, 
its not going to be shot down.

The ship is sinking, so all aboard.
