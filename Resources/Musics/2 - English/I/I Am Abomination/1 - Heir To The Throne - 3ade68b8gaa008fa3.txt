HEIR TO THE THRONE

Sit back and watch the world spin around you. 
Surpassing horizons is how we conduct. 
Serendipity is not on your side. 
You see, the difference is, we're putting it out there. 
We're not hiding our envies inside an ineptly written call to arms.

Supplicating for prominence will bring you infamy. 
This was well earned. 
This is our merit. 
The throne is ours. 
We will spare you the ground. 
Sloth will not take our crown.

We've set the oceans on fire. 
Pulled the galaxy into our reach. 
Unimaginable? I think not. 
We are all of royal blood. 
Lust for us while we lust for our prestige. 
This isn't a dream anymore.

Drop down to what is yours and bow. 
We will pillage your head with our brilliance. 
Crash our gates at will. 
It takes more then time to earn this. 
We can make anything practical. 
This is our sorcery.

We've set the oceans on fire. 
Pulled the galaxy into our reach. 
Unimaginable? I think not.
We are all of royal blood. 
Lust for us while we lust for our prestige. 
This isn't a dream anymore.

Put your lips to the ground and hail to your majesty.
