THE WAR I WAGE

Here is the line, it’s so divine
Here is the line, it’s so divine
Here is the line, it’s so divine

Here is the line, it’s so divine
The choice is quick but this choice means everything

I’ve been through war and fire
We’ve been through war and fire

Back down you say, you’ll fend for me
My heart is black and your tears fill up an endless sea
Your dying wish, is to protect me
From a war I waged, from a war I waged but do not see

We won’t let, we won’t let, we won’t let,
We won’t give it away, we won’t give it away

If we just back down and we just relinquish
We’ll find what we’re looking for
The tragic truth is in the Let Go, the Let Go

Save me now my Great Commander, save me now

Here is the line, it’s so divine
This choice is quick but this choice means everything.
