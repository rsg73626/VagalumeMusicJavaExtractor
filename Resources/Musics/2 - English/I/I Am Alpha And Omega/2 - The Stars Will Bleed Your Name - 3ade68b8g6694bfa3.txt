THE STARS WILL BLEED YOUR NAME

It’s cold and dark, and hell’s come to taketh away
So stand your ground... So stand your ground.... and start to pray

You are the One
You came and un-crowned King
(You are the One)
A Father for His family
You are the One
You’re over-whelming me
(I bow my King)

We are, the Chosen Ones
We are, the Chosen Ones
We are, the Chosen Ones
The Chosen Ones, are we

I call out Your name
The stars tell of Your grace
And I feel you breathe in me
And I live through wood and nails

And I feel you breathe in me
And I live through wood and nails
And I feel you breathe in me
And I live through wood and nails

Look at the birds of the air,
They do not sow or reap or store away in barns,
And yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Are you not worth more than they?

A shame I, I cannot hide
Your grace flows and overcomes my tides
My darkness, a pain I hide
Your blood spills, my pain subsides

Are you worth, worth more than they? (x8)
