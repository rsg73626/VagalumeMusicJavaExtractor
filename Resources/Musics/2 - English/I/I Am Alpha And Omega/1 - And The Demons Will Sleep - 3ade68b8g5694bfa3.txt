AND THE DEMONS WILL SLEEP

You’ve reached the bottom
Of a world you never wanted
The snare of fire... fire... has suffocated

I’ve got some fight, now is the time
I need to see your heart
I need to know you’re brave

We, we are the ones
We won’t back down
You’re lost but screaming now

My child, your soul is all you’ve got
Prepare for the fight
You cry... you cry for the Son
Prepare for the fight

Now is the time, now is the time to fight and never back down
We must push forward, we must press on without looking back
This is our time to shine, let nothing stop us, in His name we cry...

You cry... you cry Jehovah
You say His name
You are... you are the broken
We are the ones

And you cry... and you cry... you cry Jehovah
You say His name
And you are... and you are... you are...

This is His time for reaping
Angels wake, the demons sleeping
Oh to feel the earth shake
Is to feel Him call my name

This is His time for reaping
The angels wake, the demons sleeping

Oh God your love, your passion for me
It’s something I can’t ever be worthy
I feel you near, I feel you near me
And I feel you near, it’s all I’ll ever need.
