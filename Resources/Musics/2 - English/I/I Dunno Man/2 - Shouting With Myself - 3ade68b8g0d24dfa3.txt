SHOUTING WITH MYSELF

You see me with my past
Not judging is the last
Becoming out of order
you think that I aint instable
looking with my drunken eyes
and now I’m unstable!

YEEEEEAAAA

You cannot se me
Or maybe try to kill me
Get rotten is my body work
my soul drop in a coma
And my heart cannot breath
there’re asks borning

I know! I won’t let you down |
To see you crying            |
Am I amazing?              |X2 
and you! forgot me at all    | 
To see me fall               |
Am I amazing?                |


Am I amazing?
Am I amazing!? ( com scream)
