SKATE OR DIE

I got nothing to do
and I say fuck everything
I need a fucking drink
You can't tell me what to do
and I don't fell like going to school

I want to skateboard, every day
every time, for all my life

I don't know live straight as I live on the edge
what is better for you, maybe isn't better for me
And I don't care about shit
I do what I want to do
And I don't fell like going to school

I want to skateboard, every day
every time, for all my life
