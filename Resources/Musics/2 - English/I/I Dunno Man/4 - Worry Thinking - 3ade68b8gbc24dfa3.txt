WORRY THINKING

Wake up for tomorrow, can you forget yesterday
walking among the futures, the choices just ran away
when I see you the time stops, can’t talk and cannot move
strange like an affliction, can’t stop drinking coffee and coffee

A normal guy, who lives in a little town
he tried things and fell in love for somehow
but he discovered the worst story
she only talk to him, asking for his cell phone

Wake up for tomorrow, can you forget yesterday
walking among the futures, the choices just ran away
when I see you the time stops, can’t talk and cannot move
strange like an affliction, can’t stop drinking coffee and coffee

he decided that he’ll take an attitude
will say fuck everything, I just want you
I can’t leave you, can’t take my head out of this think
 you won’t get disappointed, I’ll just let you decide that
