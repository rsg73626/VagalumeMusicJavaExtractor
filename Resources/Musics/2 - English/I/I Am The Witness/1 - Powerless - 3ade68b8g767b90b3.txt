POWERLESS

This is where you stand tall
All the days when you feel like nothing
Just a need to feel something
When things in life don't go your way go your way

It's your escape from all the pain
What it takes to feel better
The only way to fight off your fears
Is finding satisfaction in their tears

There you are powerless and afraid
But here they're the victims of this game
Knowing how it fees to go home where theres so much hate
It's the only way to live, this is your fate

It's your escape from all the pain
What it takes to feel better
The only way to fight off your fears
Is finding satisfaction in their tears

All I've ever wanted
Is to understand
You know what pushes you
To do the things you do
Things you do

Every action has a consequence
But theres also a cause
Every bully has their own
Reason why they're lost
