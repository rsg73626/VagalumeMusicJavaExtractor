AUTOMATIC

I feel something going inside me.
So I need to move, I need to fly.
Come and get funky and warm with me.
It's time to get up andget it off.
Yes I love you baby and I need you too.
But let's be so serius ' cause right now.

CH:
I just wanna spread out and fly .
I just kick back and slide.
Move on automatic a while, automatic .
I just wanna follow my feet .
I just wanna dance to the beat.
Move on automatic a while, automatic.

The night is young for a beating heart .
And I will be waiting with open arms .
So come get fynky and warm with me.
To be what you feelcan beeasy.
Yes I love you baby and I need you too.
But let's be so serius ' cause right now

I just wanna spread out and fly 
I just just kick back and slide
Move on a automatic a while, automatic 
I just wanna follow my feet
I just wanna dance to the beat 
Move on a automatica while, automatic
