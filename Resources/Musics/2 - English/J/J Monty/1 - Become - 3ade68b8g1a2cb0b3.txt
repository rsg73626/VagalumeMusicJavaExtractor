BECOME

We've all been given an assignment
Every single one of us
We've all been designed to occupy a place in the body
You'd think that we would embrace it
but oddly we've replaced it with folly
So on the day we depart
We'll explain to our God who would hang on a cross
We were ashamed to exalt you in the face of the false
So at night we're awake
In the day, we're exhausted
We've strayed from the promise
relayed through His prophets
While Satan is scoffing, orchestrating, and plotting
The sin in this world
The ladies that often are stripped from their homes
And exchanged for a profit
The millions of Christians that are placed in a coffin
By thousands of Muslims obeying Muhammad
The babies, no fathers
The slain, and the fallen
The blood on our hands
The stain on our conscience
It was your name that He called
In Isaiah when God said, "Whom shall I send? "
Your hand raised
Then you thought regret
Every name that I've lost
Fear has placed me in bondage
Sin is engraved in my posture
Confusion in my brain, it won't stop
And doubt, are you sure it's my name that you called?

See you can become everything
that our Father has called you to be
In spite of yourself, the way that you feel
and the flaws that you see
Your past is a mess and the scars
you received make it hard to believe
But the pain of your past will now serve
as a win that we all can achieve
See Jesus was hung and He bled
and He died that we all could be free
But the things of this world try to strangle
you and make it harder to breathe
But the people in bondage are waiting on you
to acknowledge their need
And if Christ doesn't meet you halfway
then what kind of God would He be?
So we fight for the truth
And disciple the youth
Who are biting the fruit
We rebuild the image of Christ in the church
the bride and the groom
And now we must go
As darkness approaches
We're losing the Son
There's a world that will know Him
But now we're just waiting on you to become
