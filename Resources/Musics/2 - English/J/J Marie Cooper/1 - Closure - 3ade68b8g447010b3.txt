CLOSURE

Put on the breaks,
Right now we're driving down a dead end road in the dark,
This shit is lame
I want a taste of life without this thorn in my side

It's always been the same,
Never quite together, never quite apart,
And as much as I love you, we're going round 
and around and it's wearing me down

So it's closure now,
This time it's over and out,
And I know it's real tough, but desire's not enough,
To relinquish away the doubt
Yes it's closure now
This time it's over and out

Get out my way,
Hush yourself, don't say another word, the damage is done,
It's too little too late,
This isn't working, and now we're both hurting,
Drop the case,
This ain't the one, and our time is done
Cos as much as I love you, we're going round 
and around and it's wearing me down

So it's closure now,
This time it's over and out,
And I know it's real tough, but desire's not enough,
To relinquish away the doubt
Yes it's closure now
This time it's over and out

We're a million worlds apart,
It shouldn't ever have to be this hard,
You're not who I had you down to be at all
So don't go running after me I won't answer your call

Yes it's closure now,
This time it's over and out,
And I know it's real tough, but desire's not enough,
To relinquish away the doubt
Yes it's closure now
This time it's over and out
