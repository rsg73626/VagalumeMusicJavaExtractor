THAT'S LOVE FOR YOU

Where were you in the silence
In the small hours, in the broken start
I was here, I was waiting
For someone to come fill my heart
Now you're here I feel sheltered
There's no fear, ‘cos I know

That you love every part, the bruises and scars
In your eyes they're simply the truth
You see through my skin, you look right within
Just where I've been
And that's love for you, that's love for you, that's love for you

Where was I in the silence
When all I could see was a love for me
You were there, you were waiting
For the moment when my eyes would see
Now I'm here, I'm discovered
Bathed in sunlight, now I know

That you love every part, the bruises and scars
In your eyes they're simply the truth
You see through my skin, you look right within
It's just where I've been
And that's love for you, that's love for you, that's love for you

I shot through the fire like a cannonball,
You would catch me each and every time I would fall
There's no doubt in my mind when I need you that you are the one who will always be there, oh yeah
You're with me every day, in every drop of rain
And nothing could stand in your way

‘Cos you love every part, the bruises and scars
In your eyes they're simply the truth
You see through my skin, you look right within
It's just where I've been
And that's love for you, that's love for you, that's love for you
That's love for you, that's love for you
