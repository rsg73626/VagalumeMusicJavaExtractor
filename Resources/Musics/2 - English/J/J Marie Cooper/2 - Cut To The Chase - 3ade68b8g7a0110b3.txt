CUT TO THE CHASE

Should I just watch you leave as I ask myself why
You really seem to get to me, when will we ever cross the line?
Don't hold my stare then give me air ‘til the next time
Why do we make believe that we're not frontin' with our pride?

So don't hold back just say it to my face
Can we break this down and cut right to the chase?
Come and say what you mean, I'm all for keeping it real
It doesn't have to be a dream, just simply do as we feel
Don't hold my stare then give me air ‘til the next time
Why do we make believe that we're not frontin' with our pride?

Don't hold back just tell me to my face
Can we break this down and cut right to the chase?
Don't hold back say it to my face
Can we break this down and cut right to the chase? Ohhhhh

Open up your heart and I'll soon come running
There's no day but today
Give me a signal, give me a sign and I'm there
I'll be there
There's no time like the present, don't leave me waiting too long
Just say the word and I'll be there
Tell me you care

Don't hold back just say it to my face
Can we break this down and cut right to the chase?
Don't hold back, say it to my face, yeah
Can we break this down and cut right to he chase?
I wanna cut right to the chase
