SHINE

Cold there, left on that mountain long enough
All that I thought I knew, all turned to dust
Nothing drifting so far out to sea, didn't know where to find
All I could be
The water's cleared my doubts and fears surrendered on the shore
I never felt this way, everything and more
You tore my heart open wide, suddenly everything flooded with light
You set my spirit on fire, making me shine
You turned my eyes to the sun, suddenly everything's singing this song
You set my spirit on fire, making me shine
Perfection, what an illusion of the mind
So now I gently fall away from my pride
Now I can see I was blind, you were right in front of me, ohhh yeah
Always here, always there, always have and always will be
You tore my heart open wide, suddenly everything flooded with light
You set my spirit on fire, making me shine
You turned my eyes to the sun, suddenly everything's singing this song
You set my spirit on fire, making me shine
You make me shine, you're making me shine
You make me shine, you make me shine
Now I'm tearing down the barricade
When you're here with me I can't be afraid
Casting the shadows out, I'm not ashamed to shout about
How you fill me up, how I overflow
You pour your love out everywhere I go
I'm gonna tell everyone
You're my Earth, my Moon, my Suuuu-INE
â€¦.suddenly everything's singing this song
You set my spirit on fire, making me shine, you make me shine you make me shine
Heart's open wide, suddenly everything flooded with light
You set my spirit on fire
Making me shine
You make me shine
