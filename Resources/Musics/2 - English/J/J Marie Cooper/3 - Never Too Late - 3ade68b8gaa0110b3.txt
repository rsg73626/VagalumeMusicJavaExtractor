NEVER TOO LATE

My lover my best friend, love of my life
I thought that we were forever this time
Guess it was all in my mind
She looks like a nice girl
But can she love you like me
I think you know the real answer my love
It's up to you to agree

Yes I know that I've hurt you
But we've both played our part
God give us forgiveness to let down our guards

And just be, forget the past
I know that love isn't easy
But we were meant to last
We can be free from our mistakes
If we say that we love one another
It's never too late

Nobody can tell us, it's up to us to decide
I won't force you to give me an answer
Cos that wouldn't be right, no no no
You say that you love me, but then you say there's no rush
But the longer you leave me here waiting
The more I hunger for your touch
Yes I know that I've hurt you
And you've let me down
But this is a new day
So let's live for now

And just be, forget the past
I know that love isn't easy
But we were meant to last
We can be free from our mistakes
If we say that we love one another
It's never too late, no

And though hearts have been broken and bridges been burned
I know we can make it despite all the hurt
Lets take all of our wrongs and make all of them right
Cos you are the one that I love for the rest of my life…….

We can be free, forget the past
I know that love isn't easy, no no no
But we were made to last
We can be free from our mistakes
If we say that we love one another it's never too late
If we say that we love one another
It's never too late
