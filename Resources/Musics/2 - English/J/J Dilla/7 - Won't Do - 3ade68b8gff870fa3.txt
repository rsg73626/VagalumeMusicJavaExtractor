WON'T DO

For me, no...
One won't do it, two is not enough for me,no
One won't do, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do it, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do...

[verse 1:]
Now lets take it from tippedy
Hottest thang, went from jacob to tiffany's
Could of kept it real with this real nigga
Or kept your mouth closed maybe we could deal witcha
She gets two freaks, the wife and the boss
Had all 3 of 'em liking it raw
Pimp put on wait from fighting them off
In the mall, you see it and like it, it's yours
Thats a nice fit, you ain't gotta price, shit
I pays for it like the mics in the source
We pack big bags out of saks 5th ave
"mister, put 'em in the back, where the fifth at"
I need space for all of my womens
In these days, the argue is limited
I replace the broad if she trippin'
It's deep game and all in the pimpin'!

Uh, you got one that's cool
Nowadays everybody got two
That'll do but, i need another one
Yeah, and another one

One won't do, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do it, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do it, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do..

[verse 2:]
Lets see, i got one, got two, got..
Tell me do you got what i need
A fourth party that can run our team, you know
Keep 'em in line, 'cause one might need it
This here the guy that your hun might creep with
She might do some freak-nick shit on ya
I keeps to the beats and bonin' them
Whole body blingin' like 3-p-o, nigga
And when i pull that fucker out, it attracts the gold-diggers
With them big 'ol jelly, smuckered out
Make dill wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like tucker's in it
All you hear is them custom 10-inches beatin'
Like 15's, ma can i fit in them jeans
You seem like a true team playa for real, love
Fuck with cha boy j to the dilla, yeah

You got one thats cool
Nowadays everybody got two
That'll do but, i need another one
Yep, i needs another one

One won't do, two is not enough for me, no
One...two is not enough for me, no
One won't do, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do it, two is not enough for me, no
One won't do...
