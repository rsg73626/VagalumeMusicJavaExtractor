COMIN' AFTER YOU

Party people! 
This is radio clash and i'm tryin out something new 
Put your skull down mister I'm gonna kick your ass 'cause i'm trying out something new 
So put your ear to the speaker and blow your brains out 
The way I did it when I was young without a doubt 
I came a long way for god's sake 
Why I gotta explain damn everything 
Gonna jump to the up the up grab the rythm 
Gonna make this punk jump and lose a ahhh! 
You know what? Can I get a what what? 
What? You don't feel it? 
Run to the front I'll make you feel it 
Run to the front I'll make you feel it 
Yeah sucka! 

Chorus 
I said what kind of feeling done got you all in it - I'm coming after you 
Some punks got the spirit I know you wanna hear it - I'm coming after you 
The greats once said it don't make me repeat it - I'm coming after you 
Don't act like it died with the clash 
I'm bringing it back I'm bringing it back 
SUCKAA!!! 

This one goes out to all you kids rockin' Straight Outta Compton and Combat Rock get up get up get up 
This is radio clash and I'm trying out something new 
Put your skull down mister I'm gonna kick your ass 'cause I'm trying out something new 
So don't act like you didn't know 
Cause the whole damn world already knew 
So if you see Johnny Five bust the robot 
I guess that means it's just gotta be true 
Whatch the girls say what he got? What he got? 
I got it all 
So if you say you don't feel it 
Sheriff don't like it 

Chorus 

It's been a long time coming 
I'm tired of running, these people want something 
They say I'm giving nothing, you say I'm giving nothing 
You call what I'm giving nothing? You're wanting something 
I'm gonna break your neck 
So run to the front I'll give you somethin' 
Run to the front I'll give you somethin' 
Yeah sucka! 

Chorus
