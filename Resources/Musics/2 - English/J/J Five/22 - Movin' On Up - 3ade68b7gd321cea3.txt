MOVIN' ON UP

when I was about 13 years old I fell in love her name was hip-hop.. 
Why won't you 
Give me the time to give you guys the time of your life 
Got a chance to prove myself I better say it right 
A mic check yo is this mic on 
On another note I wanna rock your boat 
Like a tidal wave who's got a line to save 
My day from becomin' like the rest 
I got a lot to say why don't I save my breath 
I'm on another quest and you're my humble guest 
So please jump in peep this tune I'm hummin' 
I think you'd really love it 
That's a sweet assumption 
They call me johnny five why don't you sing me somethin' 

Chorus 
So you're asking me 
Why I did what I did pull a quick one on love 
I didn't pull she pushed 
I've had enough so I'm movin' on up 

I didn't climb on ride on any kinda freeway 
Braggin' 'bout my writes hyped tryin' to buy some leeway 
was digging in the crates 
Found my way out by mistake 
They put the light up on my face 
No one cared about my faith 
No one heard of johnny five 
So let me tell ya right now how boy came alive 
Lost in L.A. watching cats rocking open mics 
Took a leap of faith grabbed the mic and proved my hype 
It's been a long time and I never asked anyone to believe 
Until now hows my voice sounding in your dreams 
Imagine what'll happen when the crowds start clappin' 
And I turn to the cameras like "you call that rappin?" 

Chorus 

It's johnny five I write songs and kill herbs 
Like an angry chef on prozac tryin' to control his violent urge 
And dusty plays the back pushin' buttons like drunk Russians like 
Oops I did it again 
Drillin' 'em from over consumption of unintelligent malevolence 
Slow down they're not getting' it it's your last chance so try settin it 
Cause I'm settin it up in less than five steps its dusty white and johnny five 
And we're as live as it gets come on 

Chorus
