FIRE FOREVER

Do you think it's fair,
To hold the world's fate in your hands,
Masses honour your name,
Having bloody wars in return

Don't touch me, don't scare me,
Just let me live my life alone,
It's my choice, not your gift,
I don't want to crawl under stone

Say my name I will answer,
Give a sign, you'll hear my prayer

The more they believe,
The less they live,
I swear I will surrender

Fire forever,
It's inside me, I'm my own master
I trust no one but me / fire
The road is long, my heart is stronger,
I'll have the faith forever

They're spreading the holy word,
Expecting money in return,
If it is the way to love,
Sorry I don't understand

Don't touch me, don't scare me,
Just let me live my life alone,
It's my choice, not your gift,
I want to lead my future

Say my name I will answer,
Give a sign, you'll hear my prayer

The more they believe,
The less they live,
I swear I will surrender

Fire forever,
It's inside me, I'm my own master
I trust no one but me / fire
The road is long, my heart is stronger,
I'll have the faith forever
