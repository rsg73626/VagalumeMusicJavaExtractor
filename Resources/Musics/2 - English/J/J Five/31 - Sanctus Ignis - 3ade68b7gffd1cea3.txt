SANCTUS IGNIS

Looking for sanctuary is not what it seems
A journey for all, in there distant dreams.
The voice of a wise man
Singing in there hearts.
Your pride is your mentor,
Honor is where it all starts.
Now the wind has changed
And the fear in your eyes
Plages your soul, to make your fire
Burn with rage forever after
Your caught in the web of desire
The will of man
And his quest for perfection.
Exept the truth,
In the silence of the moment
What you don't know now
You will witness someday
And what you don't feel know
Will be, your liberator.
Reach out and take, what is yours
Now and forever, and evermore
