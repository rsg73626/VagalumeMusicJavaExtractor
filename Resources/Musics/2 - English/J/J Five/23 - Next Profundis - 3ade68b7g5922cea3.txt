NEXT PROFUNDIS

Crossing the borders of an enchanted dream 
Silver dust falling on my hands 
Empty spaces of a new horizon 
Frontiers to another land 

See the stars come closer, 
Enlightening your desire 
Follow the wisdom of the light 

I'm not afraid, take my hand 
Show me what's behind the end 
Oceans of pureness might stand 

[Refrain]
Is there any reason to fall, 
Cross oblivion, meets the afterworld 
Mesmerizing sights of unknown angels, 
Takes me away to the next profundis 

As abstarct as it can be 
I see myself lying in the underworld, 
Nothing seems real over me, 
But still I know my shadow's watching me 

Kingdom of sleep, deepness of earth 
I will let time decide for me 
The promised land I will find, 
When Cronos will steal my mind 

[Refrain]
Is there any reason to fall, 
Cross oblivion, meets the afterworld 
Mesmerizing sights of unknown angels, 
Takes me away to the next profundis
