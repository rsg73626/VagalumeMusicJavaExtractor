TURN IT UP

Sister was a bad girl cookin' in the kitchen
Hidin' all the tricks and wishin' she was rich and
You'll never get away with it uh come on
Brunin' up her floors and burnin' down the ceiling
In the shadows of her corners makin' all her dealings
I got a real bad feeling
I can't hear you so

Refrain
Turn it up, turn it up
That's my main concern
Don't think for a minute that I won't say what ?
Turn it up, turn it up
Say what you want
But it really doesn't matter at all unless you
Turn it up, turn it up
That's my main concern
Don't think for a minute that I won't say what ?
Turn it up, turn it up
Say what you want
But it really doesn't matter at all

Tony wore a black wig lived lived by intuition
Silent fighting for a cause and running for his mission
You'll never get away with it uh come on
Smoking in the girls room smoking out his insides
Screaming every curse he could to yell and make his head right
I got a real bad feeling
I can't hear you so

Refrain

Whisper quiet pop and buzz
I can't hear a thing because
All I could remember was
All the time you took my love
Whisper quiet pop and buzz
I can't hear a thing because
All I could remember was
Every day and every night and every single moment so

Refrain

Turn it up turn it up
(say what?)
Turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up
(say what?)
Turn it up turn it up
