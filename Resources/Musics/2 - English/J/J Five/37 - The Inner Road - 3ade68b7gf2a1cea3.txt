THE INNER ROAD

Red clouds always surrender to the nightfall.
But still there is a million ants,
Swarning on the ground.
Spirits will come in a blurred shape
I just have to wait, it's a matter of time.
Walking through the fields of light,
I can free myself from my soul
Fly away my pain on the wind.
The divine breath of night
Entices me into the maze of my soul
For truth an inner struggle
Of which I'm the keeper.
Bear witness to my strength
Waking in me, leaving my weakness behind
For truth an inner struggle
Of which I'm the keeper
As a new life runs into my veins
I just leave the past behind
And on the wings of hope I try to be
Walking through the fields of light,
I can free myself from my soul
Fly away my pain on the wind.
