CHILDREN OF THE DEAD LAKE

Next to my house there is a lake,
Where fire flies gather to drink,
Sometimes I see some of them sink,
And coming back shining brighter,

And when twilight rings nightamare bells,
Me and my friends stand out our cells,
We're getting out of all dead tree,
To the worms leaving company

Don't try to,
Come too close,
Water has put a spell on me,
Lake is my only family

Look inside,
My marble eyes,
Closer to me

I'll dive into,
Our swamp is not too small for me and you,
Pale brother be a child,
Of the dead lake

I'll dive into,
Our swamp is not too small for me and you,
Could sister be a child,
Of the dead lake

Em wollof eciohc thgir eht edam ev'uoy
Infant witch for eternity,
Lake is worthy the loneliness,
Forever dwelling in darkness

I'll dive into,
Our swamp is not too small for me and you,
Pale brother be a child,
Of the dead lake

I'll dive into,
Our swamp is not too small for me and you,
Cold sister be a child,
Of the dead lake
