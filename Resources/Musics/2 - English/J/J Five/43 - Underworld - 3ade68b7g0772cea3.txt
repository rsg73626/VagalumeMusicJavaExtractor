UNDERWORLD

Like the serpent crawling in filth 
Murdering yourselves, feeded by spit 
A darkened candle you have lit 

Why all these sad smiles look so fake ? 
Preaching the evil, providing death 
Oh my sons, are you awake 

How come your world is ruled by hate, 
Unholy children in madness state 
Chained to the suffering, guardians of Nihil 
Blessed are the souls from Underworld 

Facing the gates of my world, 
Only the pure, the stainless eye 
May enter or may die, 
Paying the price for the blind 

I feel like I've been abused, 
A fool god, treated by slavery 
The creator, bewitched by his ones 
The servant of his child 

Show me how, 
You will find, 
The final peace for your mind 
As I watched you from above, 
I'll let you rest in Underworld 

Nature is dark, coldness is blowing 
Shadows of ancient secrets surrounding, 
Tears of the fallen angels whispering, 
This minute is the last, 

And as I dive into dead water, 
I can hear the voice of a thousand sinners, 
Trying to reach the distant border 
Finally leaving their faith far behind
