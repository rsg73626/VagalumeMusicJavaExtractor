PANEM ET CIRCENCES

All we ve done is provide them
With food and mindless entertainment;
They easily renounced their liberty.
Hence deprived of will of their own,
Lobotomised, forced into docility,
They were turned
Into obsequious slaves.
We ve taciltly accepted
This preposterous situation
In the name of that
Accursed social cohesion
Now they will tolerate no subvertion
Retaliation is out, of the question.
They ve insidiously concealed the truth
Ostensibly in the cause of Equality:
We ve been coaxed into lethal apathy,
Desperately clinging to an abject safety.
Loathing our predicament
In this inimical world,
Stultfied, we are unable to regain
Our blighted hopes.
We ve taciltly accepted
This preposterous situation
In the name of that
Accursed social cohesion
Now they will tolerate no subvertion
Retaliation is out, of the question.
