R'LYEH THE DEAD

Silently, it crawls, dead shadows cold as ice
Grey walls, surrounding, like a prison in hell

Rising, stronger, beyond Earth is the god,
Mightier, meaner, he's the new born master

Listen to the spells down under,
Join and celebrate,
There is no further need to hide,
Serve of the black empire
Hear the ghosts whistle sonata,
Sing and join your hands

From now one, your flesh,
Belongs to my master,
R'lyeh the Dead, soon will blacken the horizon

Look at, the Earth, pierced by rising terror,
Kneel down, and watch, the throne of your new master

Listen to the spells down under,
Join and celebrate,
There is no further need to hide,
Serve the black empire
