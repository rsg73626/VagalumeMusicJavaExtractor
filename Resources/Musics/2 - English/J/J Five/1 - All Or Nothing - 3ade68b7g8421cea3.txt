ALL OR NOTHING

Go home, tell it to your daddy 
Write a short poem on how I make you happy 
In your diary or whatever holds your thoughts 
Think of something lovely then tell me what it costs 
Looking like a robot tryin' to find a feeling 
Fighting what your feelin when your legs touch the ceiling 
You so special don't wanna let go 
Get that all the time but my watch is running slow 
I got a feeling we both fronting 
Like we got breast implants or something so 
If it's all or nothing 
I'll take all your lovin 
If it's all or nothing 
I want what you want its not enough 

Chorus 
If it's all or nothing 
I want your love 
I want your love I want your love so give it up 

My sherona's like a cobra sippin' a corona tryin' to get sober 
Dancin' like james brown with the force of yoda 
Locked in her room listening to Fiona 
You're so artistic but so hot fisted 
Didn't know women like you existed 
Is this love bob marley insisted 
And I ain't one to challenge a man that gifted 
What's the problem I thought I caught a 
Case of bad luck or maybe bad karma 
Started out lovely with lots of touchin' 
But now she bumps Pharcyde and can't stop runnin 
If it's all or nothing 
I'll take all your lovin' 
If it's all or nothing 
I want what you want its not enough 

Chorus / Bridge 
She's losing her mind and I know just the place to find it 
I done lost my mind and she knows just the words to say 
To keep my ego from landin' on her bed again 
If it's all or nothing 
I'll take all your lovin' 
If it's all or nothing 
I want what you want it's not enough 

Chorus
