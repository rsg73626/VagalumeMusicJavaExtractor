SEVEN LANDS OF SIN

Golden Tears
Fall from my eyes,
The blast of sand on my face
Marks the beginning of my punishment.
But now it is too late to regret.
Wandering the labyrinth of tears
Scaling the pyramids of despair,
The gods have now decided my fate
I have to go through the seven lands of sin.
The breath of air
Gets heavier and heavier.
My body and soul
Are torn apart in turn.
Beholding the infernal ballet
Of the roaring elements
I'm left facing my fate
Like a helpless slave.
Wandering the labyrinth of tears
Scaling the pyramids of despair,
The gods have now decided my fate
I have to go through the seven lands of sin.
Encounter with the Wind God
I yearn for conquest and blood
Once again I become a warrior
I shall not put up
With this sanction without rising up
Only blood will tell, pure or tainted,
Whose decision, will go unheeded.
The chaotic power of steel
Has just marked its boundary.
I fall, overwhelmed with pain,
Evil shall never prevail again.
Eternal Downfall
My agony shall linger
I beg for no mercy;
The six remaining lands of sin
That's where I'll wander
Bound with rage and dignity.
