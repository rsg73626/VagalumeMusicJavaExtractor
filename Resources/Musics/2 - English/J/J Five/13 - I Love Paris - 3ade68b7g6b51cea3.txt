I LOVE PARIS

Pack my bags and hit the road jack 
This aint a place for me no more 
Never knew life could fit in my backpack 
Who's that cat crashed out on the floor 
It's the ever so adorable brand new vagabond 
Running around the city of love with nothin' but his camera 

Chorus 
Oh where did I go 
I'm thinkin' now maybe 
I should have stayed at home 
This aint Los Angeles 
Tell me something I don't know 
I love Paris in the summer 
But it's winter 
Someone help me 

Pack my bags and hit the road jack 
This aint a place for me no more 
Never knew life could fit in my backpack 
Who's that cat crashed out on the floor 
It's the ever so adorable brand new vagabond 
Running around the city of love with nothin' but his camera 

Chorus / Bridge 
So I was in a restaurant 
And I ordered a beer 
And she brought me butter 
I don't know what that means 
If someone in France can tell me why 
They brought me beer instead of butter 
I mean butter instead of beer 
It'll help me out dearly 
Cause I'm so confused man 
I'm so confused man 
And it goes 

Chorus 

I don't know no more: 
Yeah, I don't know no more 
I don't know no more 
I just don't know.
