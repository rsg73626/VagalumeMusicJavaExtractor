THE DARKITECHT

Standing at the edge of life, questioning the moon,
Riding some black unicorns, shadows will come soon
What will be my face tomorrow,
Will I crawl on sand?
Is there any known feeling, on this mourning land?

Cold winds whipping my back,
Throrns handcuffs sharpening my wrists,
My dreams are fading away
Winters light is failing away,

I am the star charmer, the spell keeper,
Bound to me, all the chains to reverie
Open, the main door if you find the key,
But remember, your memories belongs to history

Progenies of night and moonlight,
Dancing towards me
A dark black and hazy waltz,
With a frightening melody,

The road is long and sad,
I'm alone out in the cold,
Thought I was going mad,
Maybe I'm simply getting old

Cold winds whipping my back,
Throrns handcuffs sharpening my wrists,
My dreams are fading away
Winters light is failing away,

I am the star charmer, the spell keeper,
Bound to me, all the chains to reverie
Open, the main door if you find the key,
But remember, your memories belongs to history
