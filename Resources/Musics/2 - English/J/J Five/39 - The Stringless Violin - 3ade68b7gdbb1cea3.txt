THE STRINGLESS VIOLIN

Now the time has come to face, my untold fears
Every waking hour, drained me through the years
So that I'm not one with myself my strength, my gift
Is destined to be forgotten
I have seen the world begin,
In the mirror of the past
I pray the life giving force
Still holds the strength, to last
As I lay dying
I understand,
The reason for my life
My fear slips away, the new world begins.
In a darkened corner
The horror that waits for me prey's on my only success
Save my innocence
Keep the darkness from my door
I have seen the world begin,
In the mirror of the past
I pray the life giving force
Still holds the strength, to last
As I lay dying
I understand,
The reason for my life
My fear slips away, the new world begins.
