RIDDIN' ROCK

They always think I over react 
They don't know shit 
Dip shit mother fuckin' dick 
Put your gun down 
I don't wanna fight 
Don't wanna fight 
You son of a bitch 
You took my woman 
Thought I'd let it slide 
Oh yeah I lied 
Okay, I lied, yeah 
You think I wouldn't act 
Kick back and just relax 
Watch the Simpsons and laugh 
Yeah, what a dumb ass, but hey 
Mamma said 
Time passed for no one 
And I'm gonna find out 

Chorus 
Why you got to rain on my parade 
You came along 
I want you gone 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Why you got to rain on my parade 
You came along 
I want you gone 

Mister came along to save the day 
But bitch was petrified 
And as calm as I was 
The mother fucker wouldn't look me straight in my eyes 
What's the problem man 
You can't stand up 
Back up, am I gettin' too close 
Hide behind your boyfriend 
Afraid I'll break your pretty nose 
Bartender, get me a Jack and Coke 
He'll have a Smirnoff Ice 
With his dick between his legs 
He ran off somewhere dark to hide 

Chorus 

Takin' off, fist in air 
Rage is on, I've had my share 
Do not care, do not want 
To hear excuses 
It aint my fault 
I'm seeing red 
I'll have your head 
You're gonna pay for the things you did 
Watch your mouth, tape it shut 
Light up a stogie 
It aint my fault 
Walk away, I give a grin 
I made him pay but it wasn't him 
I made him pay but it wasn't him 
I made him pay but it wasn't him 
Brother for the last time 

Chorus
