FAME

Baby, look at me,
And tell me what you see
You ain't seen the best of me yet
Give me time
I'll make you forget the rest

I got more then you
That you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hand
Don't you know who I am?
Remember my name

Fame
I wanna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
Fame
I feel it comin' together
People will see me and cry
Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby remember my name

Baby, hold me tight
'Cause you can make it right
You can shoot me straight to the top
Give me love and take all I got to give

Baby, I'll return
Too much is not enough
Why I can't ride your heart till it breaks
Ooh, I got what it takes
Remember my name

Fame
I wanna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
Fame
I feel it comin' together
People will see me and cry
Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby remember my name

[Solo]

Remember my name

Fame
I wanna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
Fame
I feel it comin' together
People will see me and cry
Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby remember my name
