FIND A WAY

You know when 
I was a little kidAll 
I ever wanted to 
It's make something bigger outta my life 
And I been forgotten like the rest 
So check it ! 

There's a light at the end of the tunnel 
Humble beginnings in a fight to the finish 
Hangin' on with a grimace 
Giveth the look of God 
When told faith is fraud 
Cause you gave it all you had 
So why won't they applaud ? 
Wrong again ! 
Bitter sweet 
Hard to stomach if you love it 
Not a friend 
But a puppet with strings attached 
Dance to the beat 
Of a dying heart 
Change your pace 
Cause if I keep on moving 
I might find a way 

[Bridge] 
I'm alive 
I'll give you all my time (I'll find a way, I'll find a way) 
I'll put it all on the line, hey 
Find a way to the light 

[Chorus] 
Why's there gotta be a test on every breath I'm holding to make 
I'll find a way for you
there's a long road but no one will take it 
I'll find a way 
Why's there gotta be a test on every breath I'm holding to make it ? 
I'll find a way for you 
There's a long road, There's a long road, 
Why won't you take it ? 

Can you feel the nails digging deep inside of your skin ? 
Prove yourself until your dead the end but you didn't begin 
And if somenone doesn â€˜t reach out soon you might lose it 
Cause you humbled yourself just to be proved you can't do it 

Don't do it ! 
Don't give it up to get it back 
***** that ! 
Put it to your chest and let your heart attack 
Come back ! 
I ain't done trying, you're killing me softly with your words and I love 
dying 

[Bridge] 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge] 

[Chorus] 

Damn ! 
(There's a long road, there's a long road) 
I'll find a way (x3) 
Outta this life 
C'mon ! 

[Bridge] [Pont] 

You know 
When a was a little kid 
All I ever wanted to do 
It's make something bigger outta my life 
And I been forgotten like the rest 

So check it ! 
Damn ! 
I'll find a way (x3) 
Outta this life, c'mon 

Come around again 
I wonder if I'll make it 
Fortune for the soul 
I do what I want 
Let it go, no, no 
I won't let it go, no, no 
C'mon ! 

[Bridge] 

[Chorus]
