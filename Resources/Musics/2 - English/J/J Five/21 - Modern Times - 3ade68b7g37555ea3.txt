MODERN TIMES

And it's a 
Talent most people should learn 
How to 
Make you laugh without saying a word 
People have to yell nowadays to get heard 
But Charlie was a man and that man could turn 
Serious, into delirious, he had 
A myriad of ways to paint a smile, and 
Every woman in the house went, oh 
If they wanted to act, they better act on cue so 

Refrain 
He hicked the game go figure 
Had no time for gold diggers 
The Mack daddy of the 1930's, I'm 
Kicking back on the couch watching modern times 
One more time 

Rise 'em up 
Hold that thought I got a vision, it's intense 
I want a globe I can bounce off of people's heads 
And when the earth starts shaking, people will commence 
In a laughter, without one word being said 
Does anybody here want to hear my voice 
Or is silence the golden choice 

Refrain 

Ladies and gentlemen 
Can you hold the applause, the show is about to begin 

And it's a 
Talent most people should learn 
How to 
Make you laugh without saying a word 
People have to yell nowadays to get heard 
But Charlie was a man and that man could turn 
Serious, into delirious, he had 
A myriad of ways to paint a smile, and 
Every woman in the house went, oh 
If they wanted to act, they better act on cue so 

Refrain
