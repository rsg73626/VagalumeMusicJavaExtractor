FROM MY SLEEP... TO SOMEONE ELSE

[Verse]
Sometimes Morpheus's waiting, 
For my dreams to make me realize, 
How alone I can feel, in my suffers, 
How fragile I am. 

Who's controlling myself, 
My tears are falling, 
I'll never be the same, 
Open my window to real world, 
And let me go... 

[Chorus]
And by the dawn I'll know, 
If I'll rest in my sorrow. 
To breathe to kiss, I'll need 
To live my life forever. 
I am you are me, 
I am my own enemy, 
I'm frightened by my will, 
Can't you hear my appeal ? 

[Verse II]
Today's a new season, 
Do I have lost, all of my reason? 
The blackened sky's awaits 
The judgement of my lifeless fate. 

My eyes slowly opening, 
And I just feel like nothing has changed, 
I 'll have to accept truth, 
I am condemned to cry 

[Chorus]
And by the dawn I know, 
I will rest in my sorrow, 
To burn, to shout, I will 
Not live this life forever, 
I am you are me 
I am my own enemy, 
But for no long I'm sure, 
By myself I will cure.
