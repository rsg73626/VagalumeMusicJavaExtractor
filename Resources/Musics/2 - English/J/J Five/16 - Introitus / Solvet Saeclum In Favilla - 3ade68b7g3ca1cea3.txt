INTROITUS / SOLVET SAECLUM IN FAVILLA

[Verse I]
Ashes surrounding me 
Nothing else, but darkness, blood and pain 
My determination will prevent you to outlast 

[Verse II]
After so many years of disgrace 
I feel my hatred becoming mightier 
Corrupt your soul, I will 
Never ending my pervert plague to flow 

[Bridge]
Spread your wings and follow me higher 
Leave the dark beyond, repent you Sinner 

[Chorus]
Leave our souls in peace 
and pray for us to die bravely, O lord I've sinned 
Salvation, wisdom and Forgiveness, 
I dedicate my death to implore your pardon, 
I can't find my way, tracked down by my fate. 

[Verse I]
Reign over the world I will 
The mandrakes of death I will seed 
I'll kill and probably I bleed, 
Spreading impureness on your fields 

[Bridge]
Spread your wings and follow me higher 
Leave the dark beyond, repent you Sinner 

[Chorus]
Leave our souls in peace 
and pray for us to die bravely, O lord I've sinned 
Salvation, wisdom and Forgiveness, 
I dedicate my death to implore your pardon, 
I can't find my way, tracked down by my fate.
