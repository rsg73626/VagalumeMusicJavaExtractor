TERROR JUNGLE

Such a silence mother nature,
The way you lie in wait for your prey,
Lianas interwine around the skin,
Beautiful sorceress disguised in green

Wide bows hide more than just the sun
Spicy smells of wood leads air to ignition
Twisted twirls of smoke elevate and dance,
Venomous drops kill in silence

I am the son of Gaia,
Men's hatred set me free,
I'll be your guide now follow me

I'll bury you down under,
Into our realms you'll wander,
Discover pain for offence

You scorched me,
You harmed me,
Accept the rules of the game

Be my guest,
Touch my chest,
And feel the wounds you've caused me

Swealtering heats oppresses my lung
Poisend like your daughter without sun
I should have never raped your nest,
Lurid sundown enlights my death

You scorched me,
You harmed me,
Accept the rules of the game

Be my guest,
Touch my chest,
And feel the wounds you've caused me
