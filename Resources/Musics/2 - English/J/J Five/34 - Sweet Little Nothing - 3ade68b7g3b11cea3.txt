SWEET LITTLE NOTHING

I'm a sweet little nothin 
Tea with a muffin 
Casual lovin 
Followed by a brunch and 
Walk on the beach 
Munchin'on a peach 
Indiscreet guilty pleasure 
Free of a leash 
I'm free and in heat feel funk like a bum 
Haven't showered in a week 
So what have I become 
A whirling dervish 
At your service 
Call me what you want but labels make me nervous 
Step into a coma come back with a vision 
Sling a rope around your ear lobe try to make you listen 
Evoke the spirits 
Does someone hear it 
I think it sounds almost like 

Chorus 
You're givin me sweet little nothings 
Got me up in the clouds again 
Givin me sweet little nothings 
I can't help it I love the 
Sweet little nothings gonna smack your jaw 
Sweet little nothings gonna snap your bra 

Try me out lets see if I fit 
Light me up buttercup and take another hit 
I go good with what you wear 
Hoodies or slacks in fact im the last man standing in his class 
Think Roberta Flack smoking crack had a sex change 
Went insane and decided to rap 
I dont know about that 
You dont know about jack 
People worry too much 
But we don't worry about that 
I found a meteor and decided to find a median 
Between space rock and mainstream hip-hop we keep feeding them 
The public is getting fat 
Cut the carbs 
You aint hard 
Shut your mouth you fat turb of lard 
I pulled your card 
We dont know who we are 
Feels like someone beat you up with an acoustic guitar 
Let it resonate 
For goodness sakes 
Cause I said I sounds almost like 

Chorus 

I wanna get into your pants 
I wanna make you dance 
I wanna take a chance 
I wanna do something that I never thought I would 
Like write a pop hook 
Thats halfway good 
So give me your number girl I'll give you a call 
We'll drive to Las Vegas and rent a little hall 
Invite bums off the streets to witness it all 
Bring life to your dreams 
Then read all about our wedding in people magazine 

Chorus 
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet little nothing.
