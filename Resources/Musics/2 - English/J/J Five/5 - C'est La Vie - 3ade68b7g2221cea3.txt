C'EST LA VIE

It's a bird 
It's a plane 
It's my love in the sky 
Leaving me once again 
It's the cries 
It's the pain 
That keeps me warm 
When things aint the same 
I know she writes me 
But I won't read 
My sisters got a new life 
They don't need a brother no more 
They don't need my help no more 
What can I do to make you stay 
I 'm too young to think of something to say 
Before I could stop it, it was too late 
There goes my life flyin' away 
A little man can't fathom the change 
I took it and I knew it 
It would never be the same 
But maybe one day we'd meet again 
Yeah we'll meet again 

Chorus 
And it goes 
C'est la vie 
It's already happened to me 
It's already happened to me 
And it goes 
C'est la vie 
It's already happened to me 
It's already happened to me 

It's a bird 
It's a plane 
It's my love in the sky 
Leaving me once again 
It's the lies 
It's the shames 
that keeps me so warm 
Cause things aint the same 
I know she loves me 
Why won't she say 
My momma's got a new life 
She don't need a son no more 
Why don't she need my love no more 
What can I say to make you stay 
What can I do for you to prove 
That there was nothing that I wouldn't do 
To keep you from leaving out of the blue 
And into the sky like a shadow of a doubt 
It felt like home was prison 
You had to get out 
So you broke free and found your way 
Far away from me 
Far away from me 

Chorus 

I know I could've gone 
The emotions were strong 
But I couldn't leave pops 
Even though he's like a rock 
The child in me wanted to stay 
But the man was like, come on kids 
Let's just call it a day 
And the women in my life 
That kept my head right 
Were on the next flight 
I pretended it's alright 
None of this was overnight, you see 
We kept our love strong 
And brought to life a dying family 
It's been a fucked up year 
But we got eachother 
Three beautiful women 
And a pops that's like a brother 
God I guess has got a big ol' bag of tricks 
Cause we broke our backs for years 
And now look at us
