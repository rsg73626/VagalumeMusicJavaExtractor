THE MIRROR STAGE

[Verse]
What is that shape in front of me 
Spying through the looking glass ? 
This figure is haunting me, 
Aping my every gestures, 
Stealing my soul, my self, 
The presence of menace is lurking 
Behind the translucent surface 

[Chorus]
I can't face that figure 
Who looks like me, like a twin. 
Who is in the mirror, 
The similarity, 
It can't be me! 

[Verse]
I can't acknowledge that individual; 
That reflection in the mirror is not my Own: 
The beholder may perceive the evil spark 
In the clearness of the eye, 
Mirroring the darkness of the heart, 
The horror! 
And yet who can it possibly be? 

[Chorus]
I can't face that figure 
Who looks like me, like a twin. 
Who is in the mirror, 
The similarity, 
I doubt it can be...
