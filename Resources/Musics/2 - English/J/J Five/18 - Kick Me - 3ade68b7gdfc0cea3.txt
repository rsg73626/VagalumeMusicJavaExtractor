KICK ME

hey baby 
who's that chump crashing on your couch 
no one? no one? you did what what!!? 
I said what's up and she said good bye 
at the same time I could smell some other guy 
she said no way and turned the other cheek 
and ran to the bedroom to change her sheets 
oh darling 
you want this chump to waste his time 
take it all and then say your mine 
you said you'd be there if I need you 
I need you 
I won't wait no more for the sun to shine 
cause you'll be gone tomorrow dirty ho and I'll be fine 
so you just remember when you're climbing those big old trees 
that no matter who you screw you won't do better than me so baby 

Chorus 
Time me down and cheat on me 
This kick me sign still keeps on followin followin follow 
followin followin follow 

hey baby you know what 
I' m sick of your shit 
I can feel your pain really 
You know what I'm enjoying it 
My head got thick I was ready to go 
She tried to stop me quick I'm about to explode 
Mama ain't raise no fool no doubt 
But if she didn't let go I would've socked her in her mouth 
Oh darling 
You really think you won this game 
A game and you're the only one that's playin' 
I'm saying though 
I thought we had a good thing but you don't hear me tho 
You said a lot of things I know 
For example like you'd be there if I needed you but you weren't there and I needed ya so listen up honey ima say this one last time 

Chorus
