ARCANAS TENEBRAE / DOMINATE

I see the power in the eye
I see the evil lying there
I see the horror growing deep

I see the sarcasms of your thoughts
I see the will becoming black
I see the wounds of mother Earth

How many days will I hold,
My secret mystery
Soon yog-shotthot will proclaim king
I am the son of terror,
Mixture of beast and man
Messenger of the prophesy

Hold my tears sublime my wounds
Drown humanity in tear-now dominate

I see right through you
But my will is to dominate
I see right through you
But my will is to dominate

I see the mother giving birth
I see the child becoming man,
I see dunwich becoming fire

I see the substance of evil,
I hear the hounds barking at night,
Invisilbe mass climbing stone

How many days will I hold,
My secret mystery
Soon yog-shotthot will proclaim king
I am the son of terror,
Mixture of beast and man
Messenger of the prophesy

Hold my tears sublime my wounds
Drown humanity in tear-now dominate

I see right through you
But my will is to dominate
I see right through you
But my will is to dominate
