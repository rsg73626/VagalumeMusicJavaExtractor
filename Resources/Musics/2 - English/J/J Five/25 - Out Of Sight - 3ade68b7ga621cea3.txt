OUT OF SIGHT

Without further ado 
I bring to you 
The sky 
Someone said it was a limit 
I'm tryin' to fly 
But these legs keep actin' like a gimp 
If you don't step up 
You better step out 
Cause the wolf pack is hollerin' 
And it aint word of mouth 
It's more like word is bond 
There goes your girl yellin' again 
That's my favorite song 
Illmind laced the groove 
I'm takin' it to Planet Rock 
To talk to Africa Bam who 
Said what when and whoa 
Girl said I'm too rock n'roll 
But God damn it 
God knows I got soul 
So now I'm gonna shut my mouth 
And just show y'all 

Chorus 
I've been out of sight 
Before the lights cameras and action 
When it was only heart and soul 
Oh how these times have changed 
Cause I've been out of sight 
Before the lights cameras and action 
When it was only heart n'soul 
Oh how these times have changed 

What's that, I didn't catch your drift 
She said break me off a piece 
Of that magic stick 
I don't get it 
Don't sweat it 
I got a vibe 
And they say it's magnetic 
So follow my lead 
If it's fresh you lack 
I got a dance move 
You could do on your back baby doll 
She said it's all good 
Now's not the time 
But she would if she could 
I move on 
Cause the mood is strong 
And I got a few heads I need to prove wrong 
I move on 
Cause the mood is strong 
And I got a lot of heads I need to prove wrong 

Chorus / Bridge 

So check it out 
If you got heart 
If you got soul 
I want you to sing along with me 
And it goes 
I got heart and soul, 
And it ain't goin' no where 
Come on 
I got heart and soul, 
And it ain't goin' no where 
Come on 
Come on 
I've been out of sight 
Without further ado 
I bring to you 

Chorus
