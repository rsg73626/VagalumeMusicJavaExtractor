KISSING THE CROW

Let me feel your hands,
Above those shores of absent heavens,
Sign of cross on my chest,
Helps me believing in my rest

Sad crow standing on dead twigs
Whistling my funest hour by his wings,
Black bird shadow counting,
To lead me on my ending future

I'll be forever screaming your name,
My spells will bless your heart
I'll be forever screaming your name

Even if the clock keeps ticking
The sad poem of my last breathing
My soul is slowly fading,
Forever, I am failing
