UNDYING

As the minutes are chanting the end
My fingers crossed, I say I want to leave by now

Is there anyone down here
Blurry light, please catch my hand
There is no reason to cry
I have many things to see

Don't let me,
I want to breath again, get older,
I don't want to be forgotten
Protect me,
My soul is so weak, I try not to fear,
Close the doors, cos' I don't want to die

The wooden coffin slowly hide daylight,
I am striving to find immortality

There is no one else but me
My blood gets frozen, I can't stand
I'm slowly losing my reason
I will just scream until I die,
Don't let me please

Don't let me,
I want to breath again, get older,
I don't want to be forgotten
Protect me,
My soul is so weak, I try not to fear,
Close the doors, cos' I don't want to die
