INAUGURATION DAY

[J-Zone]
Mr. President congratulations on inauguration 
Im here with advice to run a nation 
To satisfy the rich and be up for re-election 
So i advise you follow my suggestions 
"I dont even know you nor the nation that you come from" 
"Now you wanna give me advice on how to run one" 
"I should call security" My bad I'll introduce to ya 
The clan grand wizard and my name is Lucifer 
But you could call me Satan "Yo to barge in here is rude of you" 
Sorry but america seems kinda peculiar 
"I face the press in 5 minutes make this shit quick" 
America is broke and I know just how to fix it 
"Got any suggestions?" Yo slavery was brilliant trust me 
They need to bring it back cuz black bastards disgust me 
I second that emotion for their Puerto Rican cousins too 
They even have leaders what the fucks the world comin too 
Minority vultures sabotage American good will 
I wish for target practice they stood still 
To make the world a better place we gotta take action 
"So where do I start" You gotta make things happen 
Like overpopulation but thats kinda complex 
Cuz niggas and spics always fiend to have sex 
Those free clinic goin ghetto dwellin nymphos 
I know we could put something in the indo 
Shit to make em impotent while they're screamin represent 
In another 5 years they'll be askin where the niggas went? 
Drinkin malt liquor fuckin up their livers 
But we laced them with carcinogens so everything is cool 
Also, watch the borders those Mexicans is leakin in 
But thats ok they go to L.A. and get they fuckin heads beaten in 
"More cops perhaps" Â  
Fuck yeah who's gonna shoot those little monkeys in their backs 
"So what's up with education" Just cut financial aid 
Stop givin money to schools with bad grades 
They'll all go back to the slums cuz their school money fell through 
Governor Pataki can help you 
And as for schools in the city let me set this straight 
Just remove that asbestos late give the rich schools computers 
"Textbooks are gone with the wind" Â  
Great now bar up the windows so they feel like inmates 
"Ooh but the housing dilemma thats a tuffy" 
Dont say that "Why" Â We know where all the niggas stay at 
We got enough projects, if we dont build more 
Its great when niggas visit other projects and get killed for it 
His mother screams "My baby" and prays in church 
Coons are gullable that preachers gettin paid to work 
It's easier for us too we know where they're stayin 
Shit their whole fuckin exsistance is a 4 block radius 
"So what about violence" Let the red kill the blue 
East coast West coast beef helps too 
Black folks will kill their brother for no more than a shoe 
So when they go extinct cant nobody blame you 
"But people are hungry theres no food" 
Shh that aint hard to do cuz you know and I know niggas love to barbecue 
Just give em pork and let em suck the bone dry 
"Cholesterol and hyper tension" No shit I wonder why 
Overweight havin heart attacks at twenty eight 
Great now give em that free cheese issued out of state 
It lasts for a decade so blacks are fuckin thrilled 
The preservatives we used left the lab rats killed 
"Damn this sounds grim at least for those with melanin" 
"Minorities are headed for the dumps" To hell with them 
"Two minutes and countin before I face the nation" 
A few more details relax stop pacin' 
Minority extinction the way it's gotta go 
Just a few more little things to let you know 
You gotta close off the ghetto with the Coast Guard 
"Damn Why" So when those animals riot nobody but them dies 
They burn their own stores down ha ha fuckin savages 
"Damn can't we give them just a little bit of happiness" 
Fine give em Cristal name brand clothes 
Iced down jewelry fly cars and hoes 
Let those bitches think they're rich poppin' Mo' in rap videos 
My daughter's learning Windows 98 in 20 years she'll be straight 
While she's workin on a job with computers 
Tomorrow's black leaders on the corner smokin buddah 
Give them all Lexus's but no health insurance 
"Cool" And take that ESL out the schools 
Crack was made for them so make sure they smoke it all 
Prescribed by Uncle Sam until the drug problem dies 
But you can't make it obvious listen to jazz and rap,tap dance 
And they'll believe that you care about em "Fat chance" 
"I'll take it in consideration" For a...kinder...gentler...nation 

(echoes out)
