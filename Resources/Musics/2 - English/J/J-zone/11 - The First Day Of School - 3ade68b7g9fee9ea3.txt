 "I'm in charge of this class. I'm the merciless God
of anything that stirs in my universe. You FUCK
with me, you will suffer my wrath!"

{*cut and scratched: "Okay class"*}

[Al-Shid]
All eyes on me, your majesty, way beyond your comprehension
My speech exceeds the peaks reached by idle freshmen
Apply these lesson whether you friends, or rhymin henchmen
Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin with Shid, topic of session
I'm like mind power bombs that (?) smack rookies
who try to get run on my track, the last words be
Niggaz is mad pussy and get amped in a while
Only flow once a month and it's crampin your style
Now; my lesson plans are murderous verbal weapon span
Raise the ep in hand and I'm cockin back, to reprimand
Next is (?) with penalty for mistakes
If you slip like Will Smith make you Enemies of the State 
I got camera views aerial, nigga watchin your every move
Right in your very crew, got mercenaries to bury you
Contrary to, what you speak you weak
You candy-ass niggaz sleep, if you think shit's sweet

"Chapter one.."
"There's my old school!
{*scratch*} Let's go into the classroom
and see what they're learning.
Be very quiet when you go in,
as we shouldn't disturb the lesson."
"No one talks; NO ONE!! Take out your pencils and WRITE."
-> Morgan Freeman
"Well, I'll try, the best I can professor."
"Open your books to page two, and wait for further instruction."
"Pay attention!"

[Al-Shid]
Ladies and gentlemen, introducin Shiddy, the rap veteran
Mental co-archery top seeded varsity letterman
From New York, to the Netherlands, I puff - medicine
and drink ether-can-til-I-loop(?) gravitational center and
my whole click is still tightenin.
