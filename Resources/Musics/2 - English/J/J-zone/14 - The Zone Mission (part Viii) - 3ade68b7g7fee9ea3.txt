THE ZONE MISSION (PART VIII)

[J-Zone]
Zone world known player hater cause I spoke the truth
Pimp fallacies; you don't even use a vocal booth
I player hate with pride, that's my job, I do overtime
(I work) Put it on a t-shirt, opened up a clothing line
You wanna be old school and clench dick beaters
We can rock, to them James Brown beats or wear Adidas
("Not many crews have slammin albums.." -> KRS-One)
That's why I didn't do a twelve inch, so stop askin'
I threaten cute girls, the (??) is a good one
Tell 'em I'm a megastar, but only made one joint
"Music for Your Mother," I was first seen
Now I keep attention like LL's book; chapter 13
The borough that you brag about, nigga you don't own it (nah)
The dime piece in the video, you ain't bone it (NOPE)
But when I shoot a video my hoes'll look busted (ill)
Least I can brag on the low how I touched it
You birds make me sick pigeon (BEOTCH) I can't shoot ya
so I play "Duck Hunt," to avoid goin to prison
I can't breakdance and do graffiti so I'm assed out
So I autograph and cha cha until I pass out

"Left, right (cha cha cha) one, two (cha cha cha)
Left, right (cha cha cha) one, two (hahahahaha..)"

Yeah, Zone Mission Part Eight
As for parts two through seven
go look for 'em..
Right now you wonderin where the chorus is
but I don't do that shit
So keep your ears peeled cause niggaz still frontin
KnowhatI'msayin?
And who has somethin to say about it?

"Nigga, next time you hear grown folks talkin
shut the fuck up, hear?"

God put me on this planet for a purpose:
to make hip-hop and disrespect it at the same time
Diss cats with lame rhymes? Nah I diss the greatest
Cause legends rob banks and smoke crack during hiatus
Now you pawned a gold chain, you got sued why?
You known for jackin that's all you do
Diss Trojan ends for takin away the feelin
Diss them herb cats that danced to raise the ceiling
Kids drivin Lexuses with no 401K plans
Kids up in my grill freestylin with the hot breath
Graduated from Yale sayin rappers totally got left
My penalty is life I slay the chumps so we got death
Avirex foes lookin like they used batteries
Bohemian, babblin, new world fallacy
Fuck Y-2-K, it's a year like any other
(Still) hoes blowin cock
(Still) brothers killin brothers
(Still) pigs eatin donuts
(Still) chickens at the mall
Plug it, cool kids beatin it while pretty boys and thugs fuckin
New year's 2000? Shit I ain't goin nowhere (hell no)
Be in my crib laughin at the idiots in Times Square
Watch the ball drop, knowin that it's brick freezin
Maybe for a change I'll get a broad for a reason
But if my luck is bad and that chick ain't freakin
it's a new year not a blue year so fuck it I'll be beatin it
They be makin beats, preparin for nuttin
Zone Mission Part Eight, niggaz still frontin!

Basically
People still frontin, but it's all good
Many are loungin yo
Be comin up to me sayin 
man you be havin no choruses in your shit, knahmsayin?
Yo I got no response for that

"If you don't like it then chew my wood
I couldn't care less.. " "Fuck, fuck you!"

Aight?

"I can only say, better luck next time.."
