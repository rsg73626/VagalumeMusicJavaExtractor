I'M IN LOVE WITH U, SORRY

I'm in love with you
You heard me?
I guess
I'm in love with you
And I know love is just
a shout into the void and oblivion is inevitable
And that we're all doomed, and that
one day all of our labors will be turned to dust
And I know that the sun will swallow the only earth we've ever had
And I'm in love with you
Sorry

I love you
