STAY AWAY

come into my castle
if your candle's shining bright
blinds upon my windows will come up to greet the light
free your heart and let it shine
lead me on to you
but there's a place inside my soul
you'll never get close to

stay away from my temple stay away
I want to have it be the same
if you choose to walk away
I'd rather see my tomorrow
clearly as I see today
stay away

you're my lady queen my angel child
as pure as a child can be
explore the places in my world
touch everything you see
but never try to find the key
to the hidden door
behind the wall you'll never find
what you'll be looking for
