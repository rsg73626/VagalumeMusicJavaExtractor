GOT TO BE GOING

I'm viewing life as a playground to play on
everybody wants to give advice
using the bottle as an icon to pray on
is my religion without compromise

I've seen it all through the eyes of a blind man
his destination led me back where I was
she loved me then she loves me now
got to be going

she said her peace at the break of December
I know I lost her and she'll never return
it's such a blur that it's hard to remember
man I had it coming I just didn't know when

going to see her was to find consolation
hoping the final bridge we had hadn't burned
I rang the door bell - nobody answered
I tried the lock but my key wouldn't turn
