THE EPIC

this lonely road abandoned since the time of abolition
is still the back way to the one who had me crazed
I hear the engine running shifting gears higher
making every exit disappear in the haze

I've been behind the wheel draining every ounce of patience
counting miles I cannot take it any more
I know that she's been waiting biting nails and contemplating
whether I'm the one she should be waiting for

I could not help but watch the falling sun behind the mountain
missed the exit sign and never saw the turn
she was the only reason I've been pushing all the limits
never thought I'd cross the line of no return

so here it is before me site of my own demolition
there goes the last attempt of mine to prove her wrong
there goes every hope every chance and expectation
my broken radio has played its final song

will I can I hear your echo
when the silent comfort of the night comes over you
will you come by in another lifetime
will you be you will I be I
