FALLEN ANGEL

see her fallen fallen angel
lying in the dust
she was mother nature's daughter
and my own inspiration once

she cried out to me softly
but I couldn't hear the call
I was much too far to help her
to save her from the fall

her secret lies behind her silence
better left unknown
whatever happens her voice will echo
long after she's gone

she cried out to her maker
but he wouldn't hear the call
he was much too far to help her
to save her from the fall

no one listens she's crying out in vain
she loses all her essence as she bottles down the pain
this mess which has become her
awaits her knight in shining armor to come
farewell it's done

she cries out to you softly
but you cannot hear the call
you are much too far to help her
to save her from the fall
