A BEAUTIFUL END

Fate - we say goodbye on this day
A Potter's field angel lay
The sunlight fills from your grace - and so much love gives this place
The feel of warmth inside
I hear the words of your life
An angel gone... Moved on

It's a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful night to a beautiful day
It's a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful soul gone this day

The flame - a candle burns in your stead
Rose's line white and red
You rose up high above us when
we felt a strength pass through us then
Your body failed your bones, but not the love of your soul
Your love goes on and on

It's a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful night to a beautiful day
It's a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful soul gone this day

Surrender, rest here angel rest
Make us strong, calm all the oceans
 
It's a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful night to a beautiful day

It's a beautiful end to a beautiful life
November said goodbye
Rest angel rest
Rest angel rest
