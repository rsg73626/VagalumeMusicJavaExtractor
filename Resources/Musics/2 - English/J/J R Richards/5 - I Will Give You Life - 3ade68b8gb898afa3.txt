I WILL GIVE YOU LIFE

Forget the faith that brings you lies
Forget the face I will give you life
New the taste - see with new eyes
Forget the face
How long here in the loneliest haze of life - we die
And now I will fix you

Shine, don't be afraid - hold my hand
Shine, don't scream again - take my hands
Faithfully you'll see again - hold my hand
And give away - give no resistance tonight
And take all my love and hate
 
I will give you life

My love await for soon I will be inside
To give you grace made of skin and light
New the taste - weep with new eyes
Forget the face
How long here in the loneliest haze of life - we die
And now I will fix you
 
Shine, don't be afraid - hold my hand
Shine, don't scream again - take my hands
Faithfully you'll see again - hold my hand
And give away - give no resistance tonight
And take all my love and hate
 
I will give you life
I will give you life
