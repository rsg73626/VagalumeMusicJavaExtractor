RED PAINTED WALLS

If I find another way I won't leave tomorrow
You know I never meant to stay
but then I fell into your grace
The goth upon your face
as first I didn't see
I was inside you deep

And all the walls were painted red
with the blood of sorrow
And all the struggle in your head
from the past into tomorrow
At first I didn't see
but then the scar inside you deep was pulled
from shadow to the light
And I - I fell inside you further still

And in my dreams you were saved
from the ghost of sorrow
But if we falter you should know
we'll be left to fight alone
But it was meant to be
We're carrying each other high
from demons in the light
And I - I fell inside you further still
Falling deeper still

And all the walls are painted red
with the blood of sorrow
And all the struggle in your head
from the past into tomorrow
At first I didn't see
but then the love inside you deep went
from shadow to the light
And I - I fell inside you further still
And I fell inside you further still
Falling deeper still 
 
And all the walls are painted red
with the blood of sorrow
And all the struggle in your head
from the past into tomorrow
At first I didn't see
but then the love inside you deep went
from shadow to the light
