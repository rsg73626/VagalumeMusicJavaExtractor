PERSON FOR YOU

You never knew
You'd be the one to break my heart
Never saw it coming
and now we're miles apart
The only thing that we have now
is the pain that we're sharing
You probably moved on with your life
and mine's the only heart tearing
 
Now all those times
That we spent together alone
All those restless nights
We spent talking on the phone
Are you willing to give up on our plans
and be forever departed
If it was gonna end up like this 
Why the hell did we start it

You have to know it's hard
When everything reminds me of you
Well I can't be expected to go on another day
with what you put me through
I can't live, I can't love,
I can't be the person who makes
you do the things you do
But I promise you - Yeah, I promise you
I'm the person for you
 
And we'll see if our love can break through
Chains that keep me from you
If we were really meant to be
We'll see
 
You have to know it's hard
When everything reminds me of you
But I promise you - Yeah, I promise you
I'm the person for you
 
You have to know it's hard
When everything reminds me of you
Well I can't be expected to go on another day
with what you put me through
I can't live, I can't love,
I can't be the person who makes
you do the things you do
But I promise you - Yeah, I promise you
I'm the person for you
