JUNE BECOMES JULY

I know this girl she's a stranger
In front of my eyes still an angel
but she's blocking all the warmth of the sun
Let it heal when it feels
This life can consume you
Lovely girl shine your light
Make it right as June becomes July
Shine your light into the dark as June becomes July
Shine your light

I know it's strange the way
that things turn
It feels like so many things
have burned down to the ground
This life can consume you
Lovely girl shine your light
Make it right as June becomes July
Shine your light into the dark as June becomes July

Our father would want us to find the peace
he could never find
Will we heal in time
The Sun - see the light
Will you heal yourself today
Some will die
and some will heal in time - heal in time as June becomes July
Shine your light into the dark as June becomes July
Shine your light into the dark
Shine your light into the dark
