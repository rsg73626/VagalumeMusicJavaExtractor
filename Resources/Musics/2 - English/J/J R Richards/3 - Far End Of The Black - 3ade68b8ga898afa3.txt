FAR END OF THE BLACK

It's in those days when nothing seems right
When the world feels as if it's stumbling from a fight
I pray for you to wash the harm from my back
For my greatest fear in the world will be - it will be
that I won't be there to stop the world if it comes to take you
that I won't be there to stop the world

On the far end of the black
There was light
On the far end of the black
There was light
And it was you

I wait in the black as you bathe yourself in light
And pray for you to wash the harm from my back
My greatest fear in the world will be - it will be
that I won't be there to stop the world if it comes to take you
that I won't be there to stop the world

On the far end of the black
There was light - was light
On the far end of the black
There was light - was light
And it was you
And it was you

But you don't seem to care
Your smile is your dare to those around you - beware 
 
On the far end of the black
There was light
On the far end of the black
There was light
And it was you
And it was you
 
But you don't seem to care
Your smile is your dare to those around you - beware
