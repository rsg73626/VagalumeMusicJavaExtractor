GHOST OF SORROW

Have you come to make amends
Or do you bring storm and the rain
to wake me again
Still I stare into the light
and dream that you are alive and part of the sun
Do they care if we live or we die
as they drift here in the dark waiting for our tears

The Ghost of Sorrow is here - is here

They say the devils have won
It's a simply beautiful lie
So we go on - with hope and little promises
And dream that you are alive
waiting for us here

The Ghost of Sorrow is here - is here
The wait for tomorrow is near - is here

To live this lonely road
is so hard to bare and hard to follow
Hard to heal so hard to swallow
This love this only love will right the ghost
That's passing through me here

It's passing through me here
the Ghost of Sorrow and tears
