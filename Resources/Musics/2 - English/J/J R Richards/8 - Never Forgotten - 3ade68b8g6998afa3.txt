NEVER FORGOTTEN

The day we met - across the room
with your blue-jean-black-shirt-angel
There was only you
Then you were gone and I needed you
Your touch, your skin, your kisses
I was drawn to you
 
I won't forget the shade of eyes in you
and all the reasons you rise
I won't forget we were one as two
and all that I would ever need is you
You were never forgotten
You were never forgotten
There was only you
There was only you

Now here you are - a familiar face
We knew that no one else could fill this empty space
But now I'm gone and I'm needing you
Your touch, your skin, your strength within
to get me through
 
I won't forget the shade of eyes in you
and all the reasons you rise
I won't forget that we are one as two
and all that I could ever need is you
You are never forgotten
You are never forgotten
There is only you
There is only you
 
I won't forget the shade of eyes in you
and all the reasons you rise
I won't forget that we are one as two
and all that I could ever need is you
 
You are never forgotten
You are never forgotten
You are never forgotten
There is only you
There is only you
