YOU'RE THE ONLY WAY HOME

You're the only one who knows the way home
You're the only one who knows the way home

But you're already gone
and I feel for the drowning storm
Rules get bent and broken - betrayed - trampled to the ground

You're the only one who knows the way
You're the only one
that can help me through the storm

The fear of this unknown
is all the darkness is
When you leave me alone
an utter blackness gives into...

You're the only one who knows the way
You're the only one who knows the way - knows the way

Dry and cracked we wait for winter rain
and bend our backs into a thousand shapes
You know I won't survive 'til you rescue me

You're the only one who knows the way
You're the only one who knows the way
knows the way home
You're - you're the only one
You're - you're the only one
 
You know I won't survive until you rescue me
You're the only one
And you're - you're the only one
