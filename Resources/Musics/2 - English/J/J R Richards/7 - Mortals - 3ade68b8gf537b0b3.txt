MORTALS

Here we are stranded in time
Cut a drift, floating with the tide
We are nowhere to be found
Can I find any time?
Cut the ties with the lies
Find a way to leave this battleground

Doing this can lift you up until you break
But I won't stop and I won't come down
and in my dreams
We are standing out on the edge of the earth
as we break the surface and the sound

I try to be strong
I'll try no to break
I'm not made of brick I'm not made of stone
there is blood inside these veins

We are all Mortals
We are all mortals
We are all... (we are all fragile)
We are all mortals
We are all mortals
We are all... (we are all fragile)
And I will give, I will give
But I won't give in
These waves of regret are now waves of joy
We are all mortal

Here we are standing with fear. he's a liar
hoping to convince the world
The courage can't found
But in my dreams
We have overcome all the fear in the earth
As we learn to reason... from love comes joy

And I will be strong
I will not break
Though I'm not made of brick, I'm not made of stone
There is Love inside these veins

We are all mortals
We are all mortals
We are all... (we are all fragile)
We are all mortals
We are all mortals
We are all... (we are all fragile)
And I will give, I will give
But I won't give in
And I will give, I will give
But I won't give in

These waves of regret are now waves of joy
They are waves of joy
There is Love inside these veins
I won't give in
These waves of regret are now waves of joy
And we are all mortal
And I will give
But I won't give in
