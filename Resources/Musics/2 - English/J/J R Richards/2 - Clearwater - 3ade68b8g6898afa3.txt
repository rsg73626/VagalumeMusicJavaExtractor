CLEARWATER

Is this a mystic deep dark spell
or a joke to make us come undone and yell
Another blackness' tries again
to bend our will behind our backs
And hold us down til' we say

When will this be over when
Will we be free in the end
And in the end will the water run clear
And all the cold disappear
into clearwater clear
So deep that we can all come clean

Is this a madman's time to tell
To sell a fate that burns our eyes from our lives
Well I say

When will this be over when
Will we be free in the end
And in the end will the water run clear
And all the sad disappear
into clearwater clear
 
So deep that we can all come clean
Clearwater clear
So deep that we can all come clean
Clearwater clear
So deep that we can all come clean
Clearwater clear 
 
Clearwater clear
So deep that we can all come clean
