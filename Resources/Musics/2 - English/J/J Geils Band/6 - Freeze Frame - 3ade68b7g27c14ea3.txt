FREEZE FRAME

I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snap shot and it froze without a sound
Thursday morning was a hot-flash factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Test-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we danced the spotlight grind
Stop time heart for me if she's not mine

Freeze frame (freeze frame)
Freeze frame (freeze frame)
Freeze frame (freeze frame)
Freeze frame, now freeze (yeah) 

Now I'm looking at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feeling just won't disappear
Close up, dark room, sweet talk in my ear
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong

Chorus

WHOOOOA, 
freeze frame (freeze frame yeah) freeze frame yeah
(repeat 4x)
