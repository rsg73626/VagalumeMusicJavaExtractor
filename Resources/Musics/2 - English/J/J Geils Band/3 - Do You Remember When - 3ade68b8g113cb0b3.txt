DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN

I overheard someone mention your name
I overheard now my heart feels the pain
I though that I would get over you with time
But here are again you're back in my mind
Time moves slowly since you've gone
away (Tick-tock Tick-tock)
Life moves slowly since you've gone
away (Tick-tock Tick-tock)
Chorus
Do you - Do you remember when
Our hearts - Our hearts were together then
You're gone - We're out on our own again
My love - Do you remember when
I walk the room where we both used to sit
I walk the room and I refuse to admit
That I'm all alone and our love's been left behind
And now, once again, you are back in my mind
