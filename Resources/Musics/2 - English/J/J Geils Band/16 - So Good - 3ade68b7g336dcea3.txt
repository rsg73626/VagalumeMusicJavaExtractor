SO GOOD

I was wild
i was always on the run
i kept my spirits high
and ready for some fun
then i saw you
i couldn't believe my eyes
you grabbed me by the heart
and left me mystified
I had a feeling
that first time we met
there's something about you
gonna be hard to forget
(chorus)
your love is so, so good
it's so good
your love is so, so good
it's so good
your love is sooo,
it's so good
your love is so, so good
it's so good
The proof is in the pudding
i can taste it all the time
you been spiced so good
i'm sure glad you're mine
i'm not ashamed
to let everybody know
i never never never
felt this good before
Since that day
you're always on my mind
i want to be with you girl
all of the time
(chorus)
Come on
ha!
come on, baby
oooo, yeah
love's so good
love's so good
love's so good
it's so darned good
so good
I had a feeling
the first time we met
there's something about you
gonna be hard to forget
well, it's so, so good
it's so good
your love is so, so, so, so good
your love is sooo, so good
your love is so good
it's so good
Give me a little lovin'
give me a little lovin'
give me a little looove
want a little lovin'
so good
ohhhhh...
