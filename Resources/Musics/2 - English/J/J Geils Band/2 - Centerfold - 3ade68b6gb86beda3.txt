CENTERFOLD

Come on!

Does she walk?
Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes, no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain
Years go by, I'm looking through a girlie magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in between

(Chorus)
My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
(2x)

Slipped me notes, under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy, I turned away, before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me when Angel passed close by
Those soft fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee is really just too much

(Chorus)

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah (3x)

Now listen:
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issues gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes we will,
We'll take your car and drive it
Take it to a motel room and take 'em off in private
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I got to buy it

(Chorus)

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Alright!
Alright!
1,2,3,4

Nah nah...
