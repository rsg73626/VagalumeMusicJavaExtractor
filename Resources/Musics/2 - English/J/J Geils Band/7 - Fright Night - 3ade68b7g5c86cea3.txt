FRIGHT NIGHT

Fright (fright, fright, fright)
Night (night, night, night)
Fright (fright, fright, fright)
Night (night, night, night)

People say i'm crazy and i make no sense
But they don't understand the man's got influence
He's a gigolo, a liar, a man of many faces
So don't be fooled by what you think you see
He's gonna make his move on you and me

Fright night (fright night)
Who's it gonna be tonight
Lock your doors and windows tight
Soon you'll all believe i'm right
We're all in for a most frightening night

Intuition tells me that it's time to blow
But my sense of danger tells me no
I've got to find a weakness to put an end to this
Can't you see he's tearing us apart?
I've got to drive a stake right through his heart

Fright night (fright night)
Who's it gonna be tonight
Lock your doors and windows tight
Soon you'll all believe i'm right
We're all in for a most frightening night

Fright night (fright night, fright night)

I look into the mirror and it's as black as night
I see it fall to pieces as my heart ignites
Just waiting for the moment for that connecting thrill
Don't make a move, we've got to keep real still
We're waiting here and we're dressed up to kill (watch out)

Fright night (fright night)
Who's it gonna be tonight
Lock your doors and windows tight
Soon you'll all believe i'm right
We're all in for a most frightening night

Fright night (fright night)
Who's it gonna be tonight
Lock your doors and windows tight
Soon you'll all believe i'm right
We're all in for a most frightening night

Fright night (fright night)
Who's it gonna be tonight
Lock your doors and windows tight
Soon you'll all believe i'm right
