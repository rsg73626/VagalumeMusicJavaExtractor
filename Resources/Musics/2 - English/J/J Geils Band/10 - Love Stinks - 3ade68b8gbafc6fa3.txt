LOVE STINKS

LOVE STINKS
J. Geils Band

You love her 
But she loves him
And he loves somebody else
You just can't win 
And so it goes
Till the day you die
This thing they call love 
It's gonna make you cry 
I've had the blues 
The reds and the pinks 
One thing for sure 

(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 

Two by two and side by side 
Love's gonna find you yes it is 
You just can't hide
You'll hear it call 
Your heart will fall
Then love will fly 
It's gonna soar 
I don't care for any casanova thing
All I can say is 
Love stinks

(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 

I've been through diamonds
I've been through minks
I've been through it all 
Love stinks

(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah 
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
