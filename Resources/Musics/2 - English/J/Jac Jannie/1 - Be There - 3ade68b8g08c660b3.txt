BE THERE

End of the line
I'll dry my tears
Before I get blind
By all this fear
And die, and I

Have seen a lot
To see that I
Havent seen enough
I'll just keep trying
To find, to find
A way
To know if youre feeling the signs
That say
Everything you need to learn
How to play, Yeah!

Be there, be there I want
Please just for today
Be There, be there
Please just for today

Keep in your mind
Show on your face
Cuz it's hard to find
The words you don't say
And I, will find
A way
To know if youre feeling the signs
That say
Everything you need to learn
How to play, Yeah!
