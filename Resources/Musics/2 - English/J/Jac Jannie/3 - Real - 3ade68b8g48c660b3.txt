REAL

Walking through life
I never thought I would change
Always so right
That only I can find my way

And suddenly I break down
Don't know where I'm now
Where do I have to go
But I know

I can feel now
What I have to feel
That makes me feel so real
You don't know now
But I know you will
Cuz it makes you real

And just for tonight
I wont even try to say
I think it's enough when your mirror
Shows my face

And suddenly I know
Everything has gone
As it has to go
But I know
