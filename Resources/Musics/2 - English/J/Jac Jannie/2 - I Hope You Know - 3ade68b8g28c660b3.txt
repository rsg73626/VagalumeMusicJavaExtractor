I HOPE YOU KNOW

Sometimes it feels like home is gone
For so long
How does it feel crossing the world
So alone
No no no don't go

Tell me why Tell me that I
Have been all wrong
Sorry that I, sorry that I
Forgot those words
And I hope you know

Time goes away I need you more
So bad
Do you think life is telling is why
We are so scared
No no no don't go
