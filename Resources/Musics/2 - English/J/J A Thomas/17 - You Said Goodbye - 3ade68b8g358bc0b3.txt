YOU SAID GOODBYE

When I had meet you
It seemed that all be alright
Love became so great between us
I never though it would have an end

But all at once everything changed
And no more we could see ourselves
Neither to say love thing's
Lessly to love us

You said goodbye
And was kept in my memory
You tell me goodbye
All the time
You said goodbye
And that is the destiny
There's no more hope in you and I

I thought love would last forever
And we're belonged to each other
But we are free to choose our way
So that we knowless where it will arrive

There is always one chance of coming back
When there is love I know
Now you don't love me more
Because you said goodbye
