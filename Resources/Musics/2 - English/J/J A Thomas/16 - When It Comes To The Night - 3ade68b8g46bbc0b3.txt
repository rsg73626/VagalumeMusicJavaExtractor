WHEN IT COMES TO THE NIGHT

I'm inside a world that doesn't exist
I can see coming disgrace
Although I know it in the real world
I am afraid of the future
And when I've bad dreams

When it comes to the night
I'll be crying in the rain for you
If the wind blows you
Far from me, I'll go away, without you
Ooh ooh without you
Ooh ooh so alone

It's so easy if you want to lie
But it's so difficult I believe
That's the love that never happened
But I fake that it exists

When it comes to the night
I'll be following so alone in my way
If I could make it rain
Happiness in your life
I would do, for you

When it comes to the night
I'll be crying in the rain for you
If the wind blows you
Far from me, I'll go away
Ooh ooh in my way
Ooh ooh so alone
Ooh ooh without you

When it comes to the night
