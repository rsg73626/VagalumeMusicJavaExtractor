ALIEN

Verse1
I Wanna Know Who You Are
Cause You Crash Landed, Crash Landed
Sitting Outside & Your
Spaceship Is Damaged, Its Damaged,
You Say You Gotta Get Back Home
Back To Your Planet,
I Don't Know Who You Are,
But You Gotta Find Your Way Back To The Stars.

Remember when you told me (told me)
You was an Alien x2

Chorus
I don't know who you are
But you gotta find a way back to the stars
I don't know who you are
But you gotta find a way back to the stars
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
And Im Never Gonna Leave Your Side,

Verse 2
I don't know who you are
Cause your crash landed (crash landed)
Swerving in and out of these lanes
Tryna escape them (escape them)
Im running outta gas & a red-light
Is no option, I dont know who you are
But I'm never gonna leave you on your own


Remember when you told me (told me)
You was an Alien x2

Chorus
I don't know who you are
But you gotta find a way back to the stars
I don't know who you are
But you gotta find a way back to the stars
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
And Im Never Gonna Leave Your Side x2

Rap/Bridge

Look, Pretty Face Long Hair
Theres no way that your from here
Got my mind spinning like a ride
At a fun fair, to be so beautiful is unfair,
Why you think you get them other girls
Wanting to be you, and you got them boys
Love stroked when they see you, any where
Your gonna be thats where they wanna be too,
I call them other girls glasses because there see-threw
Beautiful your on another level (Wow)
You make a young man want to settle down
Get romantic and get the petrels out,
Take you on cloud 9 and never let you down,
You need to go back to your planet,
I hope you don't though,
Im sitting in the car listening to don't go
And All I know is that you came from far
Im tryna figure out who you are.

Chorus
I don't know who you are
But you gotta find a way back to the stars
I don't know who you are
But you gotta find a way back to the stars
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
Because Your Just A Lost Alien
And Im Never Gonna Leave Your Side x2
