A MILE AWAY (J MINUS)

if i were the sunshine, she'd be the rain
that closes down my day
and washes me away

if i were the ocean, she'd be the land
stops me cold in her sand
i guess i'll never understand

why
she left me there to drown
she always let me down
the only way that she knew how

but i still miss her every day
the smile upon her face
and i still hold her close to me
but it's just her memory
she's only a mile away
but in her head she's nowhere near me
and i don't think she ever will be

if i were and inmate, she'd be the chains
that keep me crushed and contained
driving me insane
if i were the addict, she'd be the pain
the high i can't sustain
slowly eating me away

why
she left me there to drown
she always broke me down
the only way that she knew how

i think i may, i think i might
might be at her door tonight
turn away, she won't love me
or will she?
