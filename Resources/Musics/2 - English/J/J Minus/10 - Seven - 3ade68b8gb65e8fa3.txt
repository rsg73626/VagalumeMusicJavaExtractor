SEVEN

she was so young
alone alive and dreaming
she trusts no one
and this will not be easy
I was so dumb
I fell for this one way too fast
I didn't even see it coming

she wants to change her name to seven
and move across the world
find a little piece of heaven
such a silly little girl
could you slow down, hold out?
give me a chance to show you everything I'm about
I think you know just what I'm thinking

Chorus
Turn down those lights
and get a little close to me
I'll treat you right
Close down your eyes
and you can stay with me tonight

she was afraid
afraid of what could happen
she shied away
ignoring our attraction
went on my way
she said it happened way to fast
she didn't even see it coming

I tried to walk away from seven
and leave her to herself
but she called me bout eleven
and she told me how she felt
she said slow down, hold out
give me a chance to show you everything I'm about
I know you know just what I'm thinking

I know you feel the same
