BEAUTIFUL

All that she wished for
someone to listen
tired of relying on herself
and all that she cared for
has left her on her own
searching for someone else
keeps to herself
trust no one else
she was in love but he couldn't tell
lost and alone
will she make it through?
no one to hold on to
wasting away all of her days
surrounded by lies
she was betrayed
lying awake
if he only knew
it's cold as the ocean's blue
stares in the mirror
looks back on her life
regret in heart and hope in her eyes
a single tear falls starts the trace of a smile
she's out of denial
nevermore
I'm giving it all up tonight
I see the light
for the rest of my life

Chorus

I won't cry cause I know I've tried
I'm not sorry
the choices I've made in my life
I'm alright
I'll just take my time

Bridge

chase away demons we've all had our share
burn down the bridges that lead to nowhere
you're not alone
so close your eyes
dream of a time where you felt alive
for the rest of your life
