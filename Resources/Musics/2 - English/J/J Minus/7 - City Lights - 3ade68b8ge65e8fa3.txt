CITY LIGHTS

i just called i'm coming over
through the rain i'll drive all night
nothing can stop me, ever stop me
until i reach those city lights
awoke at dawn i'm getting ready
all night long i dreamt your face
i'm free at last, i'm coming over
i can not wait for your embrace

Chorus
my eyes are sinking, tired and open
keep my hands on the wheel
the simple things we do to keep this
up and running still
the world is sleeping, i'm still driving
just to hold you again
the simple things we do to keep this
up and running

your door was open so i just walked in
found you sleeping, but i won't wake
to lay beside you, that's all i need
and watch the dreaming on your face

i wonder if this is heaven?
well i guess this is heaven
