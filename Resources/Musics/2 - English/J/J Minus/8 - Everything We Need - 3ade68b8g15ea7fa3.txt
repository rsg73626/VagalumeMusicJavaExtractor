EVERYTHING WE NEED

Have you ever met that girl who moves you? 
she?s everything you need 
she brings a sudden sense of serenity 
and got you crawlin on your knees 
she?ll keep you feeling all right, all night 
before you even know her name 
just one look in those eyes brings the pain 
and you can feel your heart break 

so wonderful and untouchable 
she got you locked in her own gravitational pull 
you can try to hide it, try to fight it 
but you don?t stand a chance nuh uh donÂ?t even think
about it 
you better bring your best 
she?ll put you to the test 
and ask the ref "who?s next?" 
with a snap of her fingers and a twist of the hips 
your loosing yourself yeah your starting to slip 
into a state of confusion, a pure illusion 
a fairytale romance without a conclusion 
and she knows that she?s got it 
she?s gonna flaunt it, make you want it 
and there?s just no way to stop it 

Chorus 

when you close your eyes, she?s all you see 
fallen angel, hides her halo underneath 
a pair of broken wings caused by broken dreams 
she?s an angel, but is she everything she seems? 

Extended Chorus 
it?s so frustrating and complicated 
she can make you, or break you, or take you away 
take you away 

she gotcha locked down, adrenaline rush 
she?s so beautiful outside 
a picture perfect priceless smile through your eyes 
she can not be denied 

the most beautiful thing that you can imagine 
and you can?t stand it cause you donÂ?t have it 
you can never get enough 
of a woman who won?t hesitate to tear you up 
and there?s no way around it 
now you?ve found it your surrounded 
and the alcohol won?t drown this 

sometimes it seems that a woman can hold the key 
to ecstasy, misery, and everything inbetween 
she?s out of reach and maybe she?s just a dream 
but only cause you don?t believe you could be 
everything she needs
