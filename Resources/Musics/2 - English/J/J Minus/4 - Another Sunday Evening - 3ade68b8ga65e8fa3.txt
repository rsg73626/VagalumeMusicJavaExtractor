ANOTHER SUNDAY EVENING

another sunday evening
i know that i've been meaning
to find a place where i don't feel alone
sitting by myself
she strolls in from the back
she penetrates the walls that i've built
silently i watch her
does she notice me?
across the room for a moment our eyes meet

Chorus

I would understand you
revolve my world around you
tell me everything
that's got you down
i could never blame you
or ever try to tame you
take away the pain
that's got you down

Verse 2

now it's 1 am
think i should be sleeping
but i'm wide awake and waiting for a smile
maybe i'm just dreaming
of something i find true
i'm paralyzed by those eyes
see right through
i wonder how your doing
has life been fair to you?
have you gotten what you wanted?
are you waiting for something new?
so beautiful to me
i lost reality
and i can't help but think to myself

Bridge
i don't stand a chance
caught off gaurd by a first glance
can't think clearly
so i'll sit still
can you even hear me?
i wonder if you ever will
