WHAT DID I DO

My emotions are flowing up and down
really missing you so badly now
didn't want you when you wanted me
now I know what goes around comes around

I'm so sorry
cuz when I left you for him
I was planning for it to be better
And I'll regret it forever, and ever

I'm shaking so much now
I know I must have been crazy
to let you slip away from me
didn't realize I'd miss you this bad
God what did I do
now I've fallen in love with you

It's too late now
why did I leave you for him
you were so much better
I will regret it forever, ever and ever

I'm shaking so much now
I know I must have been crazy
to let you slip waya from me
didn't realize I'd miss you this bad
God what did I do
now I've fallen in love with you

Do I have to spend my whole life
paying for my mistakes
I took your love for granted
what was wrong with me
I want you
I need you
I've got to have you back again
please give me one more chance

I'm shaking so much now
I know I must have been crazy
to let you slip away from me
didn't realize I'd miss you this bad
God what did I do
now I've fallen in love with you

shaking so much now
must have been crazy
let you slip away
missing you so bad
what did I do
God what did I do
