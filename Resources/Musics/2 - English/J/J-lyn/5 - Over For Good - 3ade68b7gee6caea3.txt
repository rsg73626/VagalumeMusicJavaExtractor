OVER FOR GOOD

We've been through this 
over and over again
too many times to mention
I think it's time to call it quits

I don't want to lose you
you don't want to lose me
but its better this way

the heart I'm always breaking 
belongs to you
I can't stand hurting you
I can't take that chance again
so I guess it's over for good

The promises I could never keep
were the most important ones
How we'd be together 
forever

I don't want to lose you
you don't want to lose me
but it's better this way

The heart I'm always breaking 
belongs to you
I can't stand hurting you
I can't take that chance again
So I guess it's over for good
(over)
(it's over for good)
For good
