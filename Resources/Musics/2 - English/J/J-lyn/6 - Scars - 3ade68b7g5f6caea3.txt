SCARS

She found a way to control her pain
but no one will understand
so she hides her arms
from viewing eyes
to avoid all the hurtful remarks

The scars left behind will remind her
of the pain she went through
all the pain built up inside
it only relieves the pain
for a few simple seconds
so she'll do it again and again
but the pain wont fade

they will never know what she has done
never know the pain she felt
unless they gaze upon the marks
the excuses she will try to make
just to keep her secret safe

the scars left behind will remind her
of the pain she went through
all the pain built up inside
it only relieves the pain
for a few simple seconds 
so she'll do it again
but the pain wont fade
