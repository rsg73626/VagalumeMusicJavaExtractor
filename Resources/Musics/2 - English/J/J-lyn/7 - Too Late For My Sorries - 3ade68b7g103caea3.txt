TOO LATE FOR MY SORRIES

It's already over
too late to recover
the tears in our eyes
have dired
it gets harder to breathe
knowing we could have been
together longer
the pain I feel inside
could pass as dieing

It's too late 
too late for my sorries
your gone now
it's too late
too late for another chance
too late

we could have been
together longer
my sorries are too late
too late
