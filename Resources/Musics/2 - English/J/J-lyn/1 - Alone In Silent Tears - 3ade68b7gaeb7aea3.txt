ALONE IN SILENT TEARS

She doesn't know what to do 
she can't get over you
can't you see it in her eyes
she needs you more than ever now
but she can't have you

She's alone in silent tears
she's been like this for awhile
you're too busy to notice
it's tearing her up inside
so she cries
alone in silent tears

She stumbles as she walks
and stutters when she talks
when she realizes
you and her are drifting apart
she needs you more than ever now
but she can't have you

She's alone in silent tears
she's been like this for awhile
you're too busy to notice
it's tearing her up inside
so she cries
alone in silent tears

She has fallen in love with someone
who could never love her again
it's too late
her chance has passed
she needs you more than ever now
but she can't have you
