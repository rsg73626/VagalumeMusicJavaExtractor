DON'T THROW LIFE AWAY

You don't realize how important life is
until you are about to throw it away
hold on
you'll make it through

You may think your life is falling apart
and there is no reason to live
but if you take the time
to think about what has happened
then take the time to figure out
how to fix your problems

Don't throw life away 
it's a precious thing
holding on can be difficult
but you will pull through
you have so much to live for
don't throw life away

When life gives up on you
don't give up on life
you never know what you might miss
the future holds something for everyone
so.. 

don't throw life away
it's a precious thing
holding on can be difficult
but you will pull through
you have so much to live for
don't throw life away

You don't realize how important life is
until you are about to throw it away
hold on
you'll make it through
hold on
you'll make it through

think before you hurt yourself
think about who you will hurt in the process
think about how badly they will get hurt

Life isn't worth throwing away
but it is worth fixing
when you run into problems

hold on
hold on
