I CAN'T GET OVER YOU

no matter how long it's been 
no matter how much I try
I can't get you

with you, life is perfect
with you, everything seems right
with you, I feel like I belong
so I guess it makes sense why
I can't get over you

I know I broke your heart
It's something I can't forget
something I will always regret
but while you were hurting 
so was I
Don't you understand
my heart was also breaking 
as I tore us apart

No matter how long it's been
no matter how much I try
I can't get over you

I just want to be in your arms
you make me feel safe
I just want to stare into your eyes
you make me feel loved

No matter how long it's been
no matter how much I try
I can't get over you

with you, life is perfect
with you, everything seems right
with you, I feel like I belong
so I guess it makes sense why
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
