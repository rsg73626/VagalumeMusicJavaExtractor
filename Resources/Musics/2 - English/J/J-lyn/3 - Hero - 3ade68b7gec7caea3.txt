HERO

Why do you feel this way
how did your life get so bad
is there anything I can do
I want to help you

I can be your hero
through the tough and the bad
I will make sure 
you come through

your mind is racing
your not sure what to do 
you feel helpless
how can I stop your pain

I can be your hero
through the tough and the bad
I will make sure
you come through
