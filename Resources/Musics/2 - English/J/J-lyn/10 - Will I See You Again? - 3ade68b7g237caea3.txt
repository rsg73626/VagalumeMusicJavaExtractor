WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?

I wondered 
would I ever see you again
you left me
stranded in my misery
it hurt so bad
to watch you go

as we said goodbye
I cried
I felt helpless
and alone
the memories wont fade
will I see you again

the years have passed
I still have not forgotten
I think of you often
wishing you were here
I'm so lonely
I feel as if I can no longer 
go on
wont you come back

as we said goodbye
I cried 
I felt helpless
in my tears
my pain wont fade
will I see you again
