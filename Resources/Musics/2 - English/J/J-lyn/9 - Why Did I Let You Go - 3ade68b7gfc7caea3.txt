WHY DID I LET YOU GO

I told you
we'd be together soon
but soon has never come
you're probably sick and tired of me
you can not stand the way
my feelings always change

It's like everytime we say it's over
I want to lie down and cry
I don't know why I let you go
it's like everytime we part
I feel the breaking of my heart
visions of you and me
still flash through my head
why did I let you go

I know I've hurt you
please forgive me
I am willing 
to make it up to you
some way
some how

I think I'm in love
this was no intention of mine
isn't it crazy how these feelings
just happen

It's like everytime we say it's over
I want to lie down and cry
I don't know why I let you go
It's like everytime we part
I feel the breaking of my heart
visions of you and me
flash through my head
why did i let you go
