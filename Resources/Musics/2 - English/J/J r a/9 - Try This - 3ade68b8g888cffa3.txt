TRY THIS

As I lay here, right by your side
Not a care crosses my mind
Get away from it all
Enveloped in your eyes

Lets take a breath
Take a new look
Understand what's going on in our hearts,
And start

Let's roll the dice & see where they land
Although at times it may get out of hand
Maybe this might be a hit & miss,
But I think we should try this

Now I'm not one to gamble
But you're too good to just sample
So I'mma take a leap
And take risk for love
Yeah, said it
And never before have I meant it
This much, not this much

You might think I'm crazy
Probably think he's out of his mind
Since the day I met you baby
I'm feelin' that you could be mine

But let's take this one day at a time
