I LUV MYSELF

It's because
She really knows her body glows
This girl's a problem
We're in the city
It's late at night
I really want ya
You're really hot

You're so beautiful
I love the way you dress
You're immpeccable
Incredible, I gotta have you
I've never really felt for a girl like this

She movin'
She dancin'
She want it
I'm ready
I'm willin'
I'm on it

I'ts 3 o'clock in the morning
And I-I ain't gon' stop
Until I-I-I-I-I drop

That's why (I luv myself)
That's why (I luv myself)
Can somebody tell the dj? (I luv myself)
Won't you put this hit on replay? (I luv myself)

We're in the club
Her hands on me
My hands on her
Right where I wanna be
It's no surprise
This night was meant to be
I'm so glad that I met ya
Cause this is chemistry

You're so beautiful
I love the way you dress
You're immpeccable
Incredible, I gotta have you
I've never really felt for a girl like this

It's hot
See the temperature rising
That face that you make when you're winding
Her body is so hypnotizing
And that's why I-I can't stop
Until I-I-I-I-I drop

That's why (I luv myself)
That's why (I luv myself)
Can somebody tell the dj? (I luv myself)
Won't you put this hit on replay? (I luv myself)

What you want?
What you need?
I am right here
Turn around
Let me whisper something in your ear
It's 'bout to go down (2x)

That's why (I luv myself)
That's why (I luv myself)
Can somebody tell the dj? (I luv myself)
Won't you put this hit on replay? (I luv myself)
