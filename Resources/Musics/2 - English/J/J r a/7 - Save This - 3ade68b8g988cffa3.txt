SAVE THIS

I've read this book before
I already know how this'll end
Now I can't take this anymore
I'm about to throw the towel in

You see I
I wish we could go back to
Back to the time
The time when we first met and I asked
Do you really want to do this?

Cause I can't fight anymore
I'm already halfway out the door
Can't you feel this
Feel this breaking down

And I can see the end
I just can't believe it's happenin'
Do you hear me
I think its about time that you save this.

Why can't you see this
See that we're drifting apart
Leaving no hope in my heart
I know we're far from perfect
But could you show me that I'm worth it
To you

I know that I should move on
But I just can't be that strong
Without you
I've given you my all
But it's not too late
To make this change
I'm beggin'
