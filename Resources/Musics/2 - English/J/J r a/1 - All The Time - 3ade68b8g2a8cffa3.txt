ALL THE TIME

It's been about a week since I saw ya baby
I still feel ya hand in mine
It's memories of us that keep me strong baby
And it's only a matter of time

That I have you in my arms again
That I feel your heart beating next to mine
And I have no doubt about this love
And you are the only one I'm thinking of

I can't be without you
I'm goin outta my mind
Your the sun, brighten up my day
I need your shine
I can't be without you, love
Every moment of every day baby
I think about you all the time

When we're on the phone
It's just you and me, but so bittersweet
I don't feel at home
Cause if home is where the heart is
With you is where I live

The distance seems so much
But it can't compare to what we have
Just trust in this love baby
And I'll prove to you this love will last
