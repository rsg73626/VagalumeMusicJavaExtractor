BY CHANCE (YOU & I)

Hi...

Girl you just caught my eye
Thought i should give it try
And get your name and you number
Go grab some lunch and eat some cucumbers

why...
Did i say that?
i don't know why
but you're smilin and it's something i like on your face
yeah, it suits you
Girl we connect like we have bluetooth
i don't know why, i'm drawn to you
Could you be the other one so we'd equal two?
And this is all based on a lucky chance
That you would rather add then subtract

You and i could be like sonny & cher, Honey & bears
You and i could be like aladdin & jasmine
Lets make it happen like

la,la,la,la,la,la... (4x)

Hey,
How've you been?
I know that it's been awhile
Are you tires cuse you've on my mind
Runnin' thousand and thousands of miles

Sorry, i know that line's outta style
but you...
You look so beautiful on this starry night
loving the way the moonlight catches your eyes & your smile

I'm captivated, your beauty is timeless never outdated
I don't know why, i'm drawn to you
Could you be the other one so we'd equal two?
And this is all based on a lucky chance
That you would rather add then subtract

You and i could be like sonny & cher, Honey & bears
You and i could be like aladdin & jasmine
Lets make it happen

Babe..
its been 5 years since that special day
When I asked you on our first date
I guess it's safe to say that

You and i are better than sonny & cher, Honey & bears, yeah
You and i are better than aladdin & jasmine
We make it happen, sing it

la,la,la,la,la,la... (4x)

let me say..
You look so beautiful on our wedding day
