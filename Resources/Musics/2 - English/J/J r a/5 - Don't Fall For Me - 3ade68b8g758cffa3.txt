DON'T FALL FOR ME

Now I'm a sneak out
Before the birds start chirpin'
Before you wake up
Cause I don't want fuck up your heart
I'd rather leave this in the dark
Trust
I can hear your heartbeat knockin' for me
When it really should be watching' out for me
Cause I know that I shouldn't
Or maybe I know that I wouldn't

Take care of your heart girl we should wait
Cause I know deep down inside I still wanna play

I'm just being real
Take it or leave it baby
This is how I feel
Not saying this isn't meant to be

I know you don't agree with the situation
You steady keep on contemplation'
If you should stay waiting
But just listen to me

Now I don't wanna be held down cause I
Can't bear the thought of seeing you cry

And if you don't either, I suggest you leave
And you'll just leave it be
Cause I just can't
