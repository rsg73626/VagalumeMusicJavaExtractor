BETWEEN THE LINES

Tell me where's the silver lining
I didn't think it would be this hard to find
And who is the cause of all this?
Who's to blame?
Is it yours or mine?

You see I don't understand
How lust overcame trust.
Or was I just foolish baby,
To think that you could wait for me?

I wish I read between the lines
Knew what was running thru your mind
Cause I'm hurtin'
"No, It wasn't a waste of time."
That's what my heart tells my mind,
But I'm still hurtin'.

At times
I wish you would've lied
So I could be saved
From the heartache, the heartbreak...
Just do it for my heart's sake
You could've saved my pride

All you had to do was just pretend.
Who would've thought that the truth would cause us to end?
