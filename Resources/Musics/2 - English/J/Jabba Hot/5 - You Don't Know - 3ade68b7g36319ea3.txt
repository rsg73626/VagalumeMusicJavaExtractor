YOU DON'T KNOW

Open the curtains
Don't feel low
When he looked in your eyes
What was it you saw
Take your eyes from the wall
You're as ya sister
Well, I don't know
I thought I missed her
Why d'ya wanna go when you done it?
He might feel your smell
It is not so bad but you are worse
I used to hurt you when you yell
Chorus:
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know why you're here
That you are going
Is what he fear
He has everything you can get
When you take him to bed
He won't to do it now
And you wish he was dead
Put your fingers on the desk
'Cause you don't wanna crack
He only wants to see you breaked
When you take him to the duck
Why do you are so incredible
Day after day, night after night
You sat there and waited alone
And take arms against a see of light
Why d'ya wanna go when you done it?
He might feel your smell
It is not so bad but you are worse
I used to hurt you when you yell
Chorus:
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know why you're here
That you are going
Is what he fear
He has everything you can get
When you take him to bed
He won't to do it now
And you wish he was dead
