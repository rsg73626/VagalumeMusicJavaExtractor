I LOVE YOU

I remember when u were mine
Very much for u
I did wrong i wounded u
U where kind 'n' u were fine
But now i wanna do

Chorus:
I love u much more than u love me
I love u much more than u love me
I know that u know that i fuck u
It is so strange coz i do so much for u
I remember when i wrote a letter

I wrote that i should be better
I wrote a letter i should be better

But u just say:
It's not ok
I love u much more than u love me
Chorus:
It is so strange coz i do so much for u
I love u much more than u love me
I know that u know that i miss u

Now i sit in heaven 'n' cry
And now i wanna be
I remember my suicide
A human again
I did wrong i wounded me

Chorus:
I love u much more than u love me
I know that u know that i love uit is so strange coz i do so much for u
I love u much more than u love me
