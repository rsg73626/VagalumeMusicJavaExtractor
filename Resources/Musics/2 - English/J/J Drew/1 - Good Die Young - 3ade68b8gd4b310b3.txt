GOOD DIE YOUNG

They say the good die young, 
the good die young that's what they say
Live it up everyday yes as if tomorrow never comes our way
I stay rocking my shades to hide the age shown on my face
Cause when your in the fast lane, tense to speed up the paste
From how I wanna live, with the dreams to do it big
How I wanna be, what I'm gonna be
Used to all be just a dream to me
Now I live it, I do I did it
The clock is ticking can't waste a minute
Until I'm finished, til my time is up
I can't beat a minute I gotta get up in it
Time after time, again and again
Hide to diss from my fam and friends
Cause you are the reason for who I am
Not to mention everyone of my fans
I'm nothing fabricated, I'm just someone 
who's motivated thats only use to fall from greatness not fall (?)
mistakes
So Live it up, live it up like it's our last day
Last breathe that were gonna take
Make memories that won't fade away
So right now, right now is all we have
We living in the moment so we gotta make it last
They say theâ€¦

They say the good die young, oh the good die young
So if the good die young then ima be that one
To struggle and fight, live it up right imma do my all, 
imma do it all
So if the good die young, if the good die young 
oh how the good die young
Uh oh Uh oh,
(aye)
Uh oh Uh oh,
(aye)
oh whoa (oh woah)
How good die young

They say you need a plan
Why take off that place to land
My destiny is in my hands
As of right now I'm doin all I can
Heal the bruises, quit feelin you changed all my ways
Stop making excuses, no use in that
That's a crusail fact, I get more then I lose from that (Ahh)
Every lose has a game, break out a smile and win 'lotta pain
Look to the sky, and hope for change 
that my uncle is smiling down at me
They say I'm strong as my weakness, I say only if I believe it
Open doors, take it or leave it
Go all the way, never get caught peeking
Gotta live it, no use to dreaming
Specially when the finish line, im seeing
Damn I gotta prove it to myself
That I have higher reasons, so is my struggles increase
I have to search and find the piece,
What I'm destin', and belong
Soon enough, before I'm gone

Aalyiah, Selena, DJ am, jermy, j bigg, polo, dolla, Mac dre, tupac, biggie, Marvin gave and MJ
To all the fallen soilders that all died for us

They say the good die young, oh the good die young
So if the good die young then ima be that one
To struggle and fight, live it up right imma do my all, 
imma do it all
So if the good die young, 
if the good die young oh how the good die young
Uh oh Uh oh,
(aye)
Uh oh Uh oh,
(aye)
oh whoa (oh woah)
How good die young
