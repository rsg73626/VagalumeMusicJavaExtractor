SHADOW BOXER

Lately I've been counting all my sins
It's in my bones, my time is growing thin
It's all coming down, and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's all coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive

Lately I've been writing down my veins
Afraid I'll sleep, I'm bursting after since
It's all coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's coming down and it's all coming down, it's all coming down
And I'm just trying to stay alive
It's all coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive

(It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive)

It's all coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
(It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive)
It's coming down and I'm just trying to stay alive
