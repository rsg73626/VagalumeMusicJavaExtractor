LOSE CONTROL (FEAT VEIN)

The business

I know you feel
What I'm feeling 'cause it's in the air
I know you hear
What I'm hearing 'cause it stars in my ear
Goes to the mind
Stops at the soul

But it's up to you
To put up your hands
And let it go
Here's a chance to lose control

Here's a chance to lose control

I know you feel
What I'm feeling 'cause it's in the air
I know you hear
What I'm hearing 'cause it stars in my ear
Goes to the mind
Stops at the soul

But it's up to you
To put up your hands
And let it go
Here's a chance to lose control

Here's a chance to lose control
