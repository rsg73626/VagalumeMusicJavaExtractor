SHANGHAID

Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore
New York, Boston and Baltimore
They'll take you right down where you don't want to go
If you talk too fast and you walk too slow
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
I tried to live by the golden rule
Do unto others and they'll do unto you
Every time I get turned on I end up singing the same song
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
I was crossing the desert on a sunny day
I met two women that passed my way
They took me to a tent and they locked the door And all they
ever said was "More, more"
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
And I'm standing right here with my usual slack
Police got me for talking back
"You're out on the street, you'd better watch your step
If you talk too loud, now button your lip"
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
Sitting in a bar in West Berlin
Sipping on a glass that's low again
Talking to a woman I thought I knew
The lights went out and I did too
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
Shanghaid, Shanghaid
Been locked up and Shanghaid
