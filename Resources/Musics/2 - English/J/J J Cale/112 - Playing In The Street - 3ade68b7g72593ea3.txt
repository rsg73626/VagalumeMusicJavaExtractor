PLAYING IN THE STREET

Hiding in the alley, smoking cigarettes
Tippling in the corner, Lord, I can't forget
I ain't seen no rolling, no rolling do I need
Come and get me mama, I been playing in the street
Grown into a big man, grass it get me high
Long before I fainted
Walking through the jungle, lord what can I see
Come and get me mama, I've been playing in the street
Ain't no doubt about it
Down that alley lonely
I'm gonna call you sweetheart, you can call me sweet
Come and get me mama, I've been playing in the street
