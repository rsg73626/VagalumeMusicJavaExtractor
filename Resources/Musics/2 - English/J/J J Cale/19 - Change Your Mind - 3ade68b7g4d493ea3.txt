CHANGE YOUR MIND

I detect a side-effect of a complicated life
The edge is on, sharp as a knife
Underground tremor, stop it with a dime
Hey girl, call me if you change your mind
Contemplation, meditation, all that jive
Taking out the medicine just before sunrise
Underground tremor, stop it with a dime
Hey girl, call me if you change your mind
I just want to love you and that's a fact
I just want to tell you when we get back
You're just the kind of woman do a man all night
You're just the kind of woman that's a dynamite
Underground tremor, stop it with a dime
Hey girl, call me if you change your mind
