OLD BLUE

I had an old dog, and his name was Blue
Bet your life he was a good dog too
Blue chased a possum up a hollow limb
Possum won, got the best of him
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Blue he died, and he died so hard
He shook the ground in my backyard
We lowered him down with a golden chain
Every link we'd call his name
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
My old Blue was a good old hound
You could hear him holler for miles around
When I get to heaven, first thing I'll do
I'll grab my horn and call Old Blue
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Bye-bye Blue
You good dog, you
Bye-bye Blue
