I GOT THE SAME OLD BLUES

Have you heard that rumour that's going around
You got it made, way across town
It's the same old story, tell me where does it end
Yes, I heard the news, it's the same old blues again
When I wrote you a letter, you must have read it wrong
I stood at your doorway, but you was gone
I took a lot of courage and let the telephone ring
It's the same old blues, same old blues again
When you give me the business, you know I get a mind
'Cause I've got a lot of patience and I've got a lot of time
It's the same old story, tell me where does it end
It's the same old blues, same old blues again
I'm gonna find me a mountain, I'm gonna hide out
I ain't talking to you and I ain't coming out
Yeah, I heard that rumour, tell me where does it end
It's the same old blues, same old blues again
