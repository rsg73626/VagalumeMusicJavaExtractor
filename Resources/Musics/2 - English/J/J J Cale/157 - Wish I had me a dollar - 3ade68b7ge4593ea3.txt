WISH I HAD ME A DOLLAR

Wish I had me a dollar
To buy me a drink of wine
I don't want no trouble
Holding up my time

I need a relief
For all this pain and this grief
A fool I'll be tomorrow
Drowning in my sorrow

Wish I had me a dollar
For every time time I see it
Another cheating woman
Just come down on my head

I need a relief
For all this pain and this grief
A fool I'll be tomorrow
Drowning in my sorrow

Wish I had me a dollar

Wish I had me a dollar
And a straight shot to go
It's been against my wishes
Love on a way too slow

I need a relief
For all this pain and this grief
A fool I'll be tomorrow
Drowning in my sorrow

Wish I had me a dollar
Wish I had me a dollar
Wish I had me a dollar
Wish I had me a dollar
