THINGS AIN'T SIMPLE

It's so sad to say
Talking about yesterday
All those good times are gone
The way we were was fun
Always on the run
Things ain't simple anymore

We took love easy
One day at a time
I keep those memories in my mind
And a day goes by
I don't stop crying
Things ain't simple anymore

We were younger then
 ___ now again
All those good times are gone
Heaven ___ ___ somehow
Things ain't simple anymore

We took love easy
One day at a time
I keep those memories in my mind
And a day goes by
I don't stop crying
Things ain't simple anymore
