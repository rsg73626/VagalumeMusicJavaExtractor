LADY LUCK

Lady Luck, please just listen to me
Mistress of fantasy
Send a dream my way
Can you come and make my day
Lady Luck, elusive as you are
You're just a fleeding star
You never hit the sky
With you I seem to fly
Lady Luck, hold on to my hand
I'm standing on shifting sand
I'm a dreamer don't you know
Lady Luck, just don't let go
Lady Luck, hard as it may seem
When you pass out all your dreams
Could you keep me in your mind
I'd like to see you one more time
