RUNAROUND

Yeah, you come home in the morning, your hair's all a mess
You've been out all night, you've got wrinkles in your dress
You give me the runaround
All day long you give me the runaround
When you say something here, you mean something there
You give me the runaround
Same thing yesterday, same thing the day before
Woman, it does get pretty doggone old
You give me the runaround
All day long you give me the runaround
You give me the runaround, woman, I'm getting tired of that
Hey, you told me last Sunday you were gonna straighten it out
You know, woman, it's time
I started having my doubts
Such a runaround
You've been stepping on me, woman, running 'round like that
