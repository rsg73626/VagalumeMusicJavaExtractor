TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS

I got myself together, got my tie on straight
Downtown, takin' care of business on the street
Glen D's got that old piano on the road
Blues is his bag, he's a funky soul
Tim Drummond's on bass, Jim Keltner's on the drums
They'll put it right on you for a shot of rhum
I'll tell you right now it's a funky beat
Downtown, takin' care of business on the street
We ain't very good but that's beside the point
We're all right here trying to rock this joint
Old mama Chip and the Spooner too
Trying to hack a meet with you
Christine Lakeland and Jimmy Karstein
He's a rhythm fool, she's a guitar queen
Let me tell you, my friend
Richard is hot on the beat
Downtown, takin' care of business on the street
Oh, climb on board, Chad Hailey running 'round
It's that Ashworth Dixie sound
Hurry up mama 'cause we're all gonna meet
Downtown, takin' care of business on the street
