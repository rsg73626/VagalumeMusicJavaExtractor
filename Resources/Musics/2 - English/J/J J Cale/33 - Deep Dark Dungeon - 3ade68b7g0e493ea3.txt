DEEP DARK DUNGEON

I knew a man, made a heavy move
He shot his wife, his best friend too
They put him away in a deep dark dungeon
Where the sun don't never shine
I knew a woman, had a jealous mind
She got a man, she caught him lying
They put her away in a deep dark dungeon
Where the sun don't never shine
A friend of mine, he got five years
For selling dope and bootleg beers
They put him away in a deep dark dungeon
Where the sun don't never shine
Oh, Sleepy John had one vice
He liked to cheat at cards and dice
They put him away in a deep dark dungeon
Where the sun don't never shine
