CRYING

Every time I see you, all that you do
Crying, crying, crying
You've been shedding them tears for too many years
Crying, crying, crying
You've been lonely too long, something went wrong
Did he leave you again with them blues
Your sun don't shine, your day's no round
Crying, crying, crying
You've been lonely too long, something went wrong
Did he leave you again with them blues
Happy your day, I'm comin' your way
No more crying, crying, crying
