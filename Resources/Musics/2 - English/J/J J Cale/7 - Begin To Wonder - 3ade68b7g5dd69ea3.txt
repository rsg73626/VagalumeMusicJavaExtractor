BEGIN TO WONDER

When i'm walking down the street i call your name,
Inside my head i go insane,

There were days when i went completely blind,
No time to think,and i lost time,
won't believe whats happened to me lately,
Cuz everyday its the same thing,different faces with no names,
places i've never been before,
and everyday its the same thing,different faces with no names,
places i've never been before

And I begin to wonder(don't ya know that its really making me crazy)
And I begin to wonder(won't believe whats happened to me lately)
Cuz everyday its the same thing,different faces with no names
places i've never been before,
and everyday its the same thing,different faces with no names,
places i've never been before
