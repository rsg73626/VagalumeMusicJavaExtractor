REALITY

One drink of whisky, one drink of gin
One drink of vodka and I told my friends
Things don't seem quite like they used to
As reality leaves, so does the blues
One toke of reefer, a little cocaine
One shot of morphine and things begin to change
Things don't seem quite like they used to
As reality leaves, so does the blues
Up around here, back down again
I've been up on top, don't bother, my friend
Things don't seem quite like they used to
As reality leaves, so does the blues
