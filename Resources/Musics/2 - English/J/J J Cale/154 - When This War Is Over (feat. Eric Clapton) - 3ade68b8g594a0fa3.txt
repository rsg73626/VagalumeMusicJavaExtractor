WHEN THIS WAR IS OVER (FEAT. ERIC CLAPTON)

When this war is over it will be a better day
When this war is over it will be a better day
But it won't bring back those poor boys in the grave

Ain't no sense in the action, killing people all the time
Ain't no sense no the action, killing people all the time
When it happen on the street we call that a crime

These old boys are leading us somewhere - that is plain to see
I don't know much of nothing, still it troubles me
Got to find another way, this one ain't the way to go
Got to get a plan, change our ways or no...

When this war is over it will be a better day
When this war is over it will be a better day
But it won't bring back those poor boys in the grave

When this war is over, it will be a better day
When this war is over, it will be a better day
But it won't bring back those poor boys in the grave
