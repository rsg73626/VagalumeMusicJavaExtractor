CLOSER TO YOU

Wish I was a stocking clanging to your thigh
Everytime you'd move around I'd view you walking by
Wish I was your underwear hanging around your waist
Everytime you'd shake that thing I'd get a little taste
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer, got to get closer, closer to you
If I was a pair of boots I wouldn't have to beg
I'd be satisfied just being around your leg
When I am dreaming it takes so many trips
I'd pretend that I'm a stick to decorate your lips
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer, got to get closer, closer to you
If I am a necklace hanging down your front
When you feel the time was right I'd notice what you want
Wish I was a silk shirt draped around your back
Right next to your skin tryin' to make contact
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer, closer, closer to you
If I had my wishes, If I had my way
I'd be all the same to you, each and everyday
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer, closer, closer to you
