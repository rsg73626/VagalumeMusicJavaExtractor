LOVE HAS BEEN GONE

Love has been gone, gone so long there's nothing new
I say our love has been gone, gone so long there's nothing new
How does it feel
Not too good
It ain't real but it's understood
That our love has been gone, gone so long there's nothing new
It ain't the same, it's just a game we play
Why do we keep on going through it every day
The good lord up above
Only he knows what happened to our sweet love
Love has been gone, gone so long there's nothing new
