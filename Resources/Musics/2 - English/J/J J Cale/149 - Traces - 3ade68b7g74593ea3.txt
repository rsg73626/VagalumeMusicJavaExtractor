TRACES

Traces of loving a life I remember
Already grown by December
By spring it was gone
Traces of people and things, and places
So much a part of my life
Where did it go
Time has brought some changes
Caught us by surprise
Where is the seed, that we need
Keeps our love alive
Traces of lines that lead back to nowhere
Forgotten memories of yesteryear
That's all gone
Time has brought some changes
Caught us by surprise
Where is the seed, that we need
Keeps our love alive
Traces of lines that lead back to nowhere
Forgotten memories of yesteryear
That's all gone
