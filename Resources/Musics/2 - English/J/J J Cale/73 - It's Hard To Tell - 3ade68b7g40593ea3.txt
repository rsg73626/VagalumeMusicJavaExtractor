IT'S HARD TO TELL

It's hard to tell
With a casual look
Can you read his mind
Like an open book
When you cross the room
Can you feel his eyes
Is he the one
Gonna make your night
It's hard to tell
Where your next love lies
It's hard to tell
If the feeling's there
Do you seize the moment
Or should you beware
Is he the one
Does it feel just right
When you're face to face
Should you act surprised
It's hard to tell
Where your next love lies
Will he want your number
Will he want your name
Are you going to panic
Or play the game
Will he call tomorrow
Will he call tonight
It's hard to tell
Where your next love lies
It's hard to tell
If he's for real
Mysterious ways
He makes you feel
Is he the one
Does it feel just right
It's hard to tell
Where your next love lies
