NOBODY KNOWS

Words that we say could all be lies someday
Scattered to the wind, I don't know
Things that we trust could crumble into dust
No one can really say it ain't so
When you go over a mountain
When you're looking down the road
When you think you're going backwards
It's all in vain, it seems insane
When you ask, nobody knows
If our actions seem in doubt
By the way we move about
Seems like we're always on the run
Our mark is just a scratch
Like holding up a match
And trying to see the burn against the sun
When we're going over a mountain
When we're looking down the road
If you think you're going backwards
It's all in vain, it seems insane
When you ask, nobody knows
When all our days are gone
You can catch us with a song
Something that seemed almost right
We've known love and joy
Eternity's been our toy
Something to play with in the night
When we're going over a mountain
When we're looking down the road
If you think you're going backwards
It's all in vain, it seems insane
When you ask, nobody knows
When I go over my mountain
When I'm looking down the road
If I think I'm going backwards
It's all in vain, it seems insane
When I ask, nobody knows
