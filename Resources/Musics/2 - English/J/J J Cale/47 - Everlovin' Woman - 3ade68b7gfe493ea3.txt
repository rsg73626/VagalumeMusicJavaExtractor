EVERLOVIN' WOMAN

I've got a woman, I love her, lordy-lord
She cooks my breakfast on Sunday, just like my Ma 
I hang my hat in her house, she don't charge a dime
Love me, trust me, never cuss me, you know she's mine
I'm talking 'bout, I'm talking 'bout, I'm talking in rhyme
I'm talking 'bout that everlovin' woman of mine
Oh, when I'm gone you know she don't hang around
And when I'm gone you know she don't follow me down
She keeps the night-light burning, lord, she waits for me
Taking care of business, lord, she's taking care of me
I'm talking 'bout, I'm talking 'bout, I'm talking in rhyme
I'm talking 'bout that everlovin' woman of mine
She'd have me do it if I'd do it at all
You know I love her, do I love her, lordy-lord
I hang my hat in her house, honey, she don't charge a dime
Taking care of business, she's taking care of business of mine
I'm talking 'bout, I'm talking in rhyme
I'm talking 'bout that everlovin' woman of mine
