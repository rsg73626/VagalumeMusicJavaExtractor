I'M A GYPSY MAN

I'm a gypsy man on a one-night stand
Am I fit to be loved by you
I'm with a gypsy van, just travelling the land
They'll be leaving in the morning, I'll be leaving too
Things like love don't tie me down
I just spread my love around
Like small change on girls I don't know
I'm a gypsy man on a one-night stand
Gonna have some fun before I have to go
Don't you cry and don't you weep, close your eyes and go to sleep
I've had you in my arms too long
What fortunes did I bring, golden earrings
When you wake up in the morning I'll be gone
