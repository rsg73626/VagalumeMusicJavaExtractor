BORROWED TIME

Well we're living on borrowed time, Lord
Can you give us another day
Yes we're living on borrowed time, Lord
Can you give us another day
Our chance of survival is slim, it's what they say
Yes we're living on borrowed time, Lord
Can you give us another day
We gotta hold ourselves together, but there ain't no guarantee
We gotta hold ourselves together, but there ain't no guarantee
Our chance of survival is slim, many plea
We gotta hold ourselves together, but there ain't no guarantee
Yes I've seen many people down on their knees to pray
Yes I've seen many people on their knees to pray
They say our chance of survival is slim, it's what they say
Yes we're living on borrowed time, Lord
Can you give us another day
