KATY KOOL LADY

Sure do miss you babe
You know it's been a while
Way too long, since you been gone
I'm almost out of style
You treat me kind and gentle
You're always on my mind
A love that's true, I keep for you
Until the end of time
Someday you've got to come back
Stay with me a while
I'll take some time, to make you mine
And keep you out of style
