DISADVANTAGE

Sometime in the morning, before the break of day
I lose my direction, I can't find my way
I can't find nobody to tell my troubles to
I get so sad and lonesome
Guess I'll tell 'em all to you
Got me at a disadvantage, you had me outta here
I just want loving, the way don't seem clear
Got me at a disadvantage, that's the way I feel
Love is forever
Love is for real
Some kind of fascination, that's the reason why
First time I seen you, you were so shy
Got me at a disadvantage, that's the way I feel
Love is forever
Love is for real
