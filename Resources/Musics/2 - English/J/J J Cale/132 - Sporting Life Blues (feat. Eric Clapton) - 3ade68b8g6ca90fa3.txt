SPORTING LIFE BLUES (FEAT. ERIC CLAPTON)

I'm getting tired
Of hanging 'round
Think I will marry
And settle down
'cos this old nightlife
This old sportlife
Is killing me

I've got a letter
From my home
Most of my friends are
Dead and gone
I begin to worry
I begin to wonder
'bout days to come
My mother used to
Talk to me
I was young and foolish
And could not see
Now I've got no mother
My sisters and brothers
Don't care for me
I swear I'm gonna
Change my ways
I'm getting older
Everyday
When I was young and foolish
It was so easy
To run and play

I'm getting tired (I'm getting tired)
Of hanging 'round (of hanging 'round)
Think I will marry (think I will marry)
And settle down (and settle down)
'cos this old nightlife
This old sportlife
Is killing me
This old nightlife
This old sportlife
Is killing me
