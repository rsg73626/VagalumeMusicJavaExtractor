IF YOU LEAVE HER

You don't love her like I love her
You don't treat her like I do
You don't tell her the things I tell her
I can't see her walking with you
Who you foolin', fooly-fooling
Who you foolin' with that jive
You don't take her like I take her
You don't care if she lives or dies
I don't mean to talk in trouble
I don't mean to bend your ear
You just leave her standing lonely
If you leave her, leave her here
Leave her here
