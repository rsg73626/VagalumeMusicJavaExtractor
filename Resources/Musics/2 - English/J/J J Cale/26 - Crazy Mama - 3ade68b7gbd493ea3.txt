CRAZY MAMA

Crazy mama, where you been so long
Crazy mama, where you been so long
You've been hiding out, I know that's true
Crazy mama, I sure need you
Crazy mama, where you been so long
Standing on the corner, looking for you, baby
Standing on the corner, looking for you, baby
Lord mercy, I can not see, crazy mama coming back to me
Crazy mama, where you been so long
