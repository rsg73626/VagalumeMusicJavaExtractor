WHO AM I TELLING YOU (FEAT. ERIC CLAPTON)

It don't take no fool to love you
You stand out in any crowd
And I know men who want to own you
I can hear them talking loud
There ain't no point in just me talking
Who am I telling you?

But you don't got yourself together
And you can bet whithin in you
I just realised
I just realised
Who am I telling you?

You never lose, you are a winner
It's a simple thing for you
If I'm standing at a crossroad
You know exactly what to do
From this moment on I loved you
Somewhere in between I learned
I'm just reaching out to touch you
It's the point of no return
I just realised
I just realised
And I just realised
Who am I, who am I, who am I telling you?

I just realised
I just realised
And I just realised
Who am I, who am I, who am I telling you?
