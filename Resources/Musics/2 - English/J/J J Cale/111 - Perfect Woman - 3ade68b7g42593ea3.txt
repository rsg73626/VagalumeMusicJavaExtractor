PERFECT WOMAN

Got me a woman, boy she's fine
Love me in the morning, love me at night
One thing about her I think is cool
A perfect woman, she's got no rules
Soft to the touch, silky smooth
She got everything a man could use
Ain't no doubt about it, when we make love
She's good down under, she's good up above
She's a perfect woman, she's fine
I want to make love to her all the time
Perfect woman, when we make love
She's good down under, she's good up above
She's a-ready, she's a-willin'
She's got that thing
Ordinary man
Feel like a king
She's got her hand on love for shure
Forget your troubles, boy
She's got the cure
She's a perfect woman
She's fine
I want to make love to her all the time
Perfect woman, when we make love
She's good down under, she's good up above
She's a perfect woman
When we make love
She's good down under, she's good up above
