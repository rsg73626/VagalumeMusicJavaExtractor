TROUBLE IN THE CITY

Heard the one about your woman
Lord, she's been messing 'round
She's been stepping out on the street
Lord, she's been hanging out
Ain't nobody had her this week but it won't take long
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
And I hope it won't mess with me
Walking downtown the other day
A man put a gun in my back
"Give me all you've got or I'll blow you away
That's a fact, Jack"
Woe me, misery, too much been going down
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
And I hope it won't mess with me
Catch the next train out of here
Goodbye, I'll see you, so long
Time was I could face it here
That was a long time ago
I'll leave you very low, next time you won't see me at all
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
And I hope it won't mess with me
