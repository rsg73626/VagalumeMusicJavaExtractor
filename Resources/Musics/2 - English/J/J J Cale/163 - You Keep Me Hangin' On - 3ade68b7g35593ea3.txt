YOU KEEP ME HANGIN' ON

Every time I stop awhile and think about your sweet smile
I can't do nothing else all day
The way that you wink your eye every time you walk by
Baby what can I say
You keep me hanging on
I can't get nothing else on
When the evening rolls around
And there ain't nobody around
Baby, I think of you
Of all the stars at night
None can match the brilliant light
That I see in your eyes
The humble warmth, the glow
Baby child I know, I still think of you
If I could hold you
Just one time
Stop that moment in my mind
