ANOTHER SONG

Sittin' around here pickin' my banjo
Thinking about love and the aftertought
All those days we had together
What was what and what was not
You and I we were so crazy
Going from here back to there
Now I'm thinking 'bout tomorrow
Or the who's who and what was where
Bye 'n bye from now on time will shift and we'll be gone
It don't matter anyway

Another song
Another day

Those old days were oh so clever
You and I and that old friend
Thinkin' we were all together
We didn't know what never end
What future is I'll never know
It is to me a no show
Yesterday has just went by
I tried to go but it wants to fly
Bye 'n bye from now on time will shift and we'll be gone
It don't matter anyway

Another song
Another day
