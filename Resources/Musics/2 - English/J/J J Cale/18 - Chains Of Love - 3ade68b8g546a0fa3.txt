CHAINS OF LOVE

Chains of love, won't let me be
They keep haunting, haunting me
Free my mind, from their vice
Chains of love, cold as ice
That old key, I've yet to find
That unlocks, those ties of mine
Ain't no way (ain't no way)
I am told (I am told)
No you cannot (no you cannot)
Break the hold (break the hold)

Chains of love (chains of love)
Won't let me be (won't let me be)
They keep haunting (they keep haunting)
Haunting me (haunting me)
Once you get down, you will know
They won't ever ever, let you go
Chains of love, all wrapped in now
Break this bond, I don't know how
Chains of love, will follow you
Don't matter, what you do
Free my mind, from this vice
Chains of love, cold as ice

Chains of love, won't let me be
They keep haunting, haunting me
Free my mind, from their vice
Chains of love, cold as ice
That old key, I've yet to find
That unlocks, those ties of mine
Chains of love, won't let me be
They keep haunting, haunting me
