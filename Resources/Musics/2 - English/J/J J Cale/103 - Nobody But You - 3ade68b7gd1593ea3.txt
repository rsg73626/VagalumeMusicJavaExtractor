NOBODY BUT YOU

Nobody but you in my dreams at night
Nobody but you in my thoughts
Nobody but you in my dreams at night
Without you I am lost, without you I am lost
Can't seem to sleep after the sun goes down
Walking the streets is all I do
If you ever look you'll find me hanging 'round
Nobody but you, nobody but you
Without you I am lost
