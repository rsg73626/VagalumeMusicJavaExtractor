DAYS GO BY

When you light that funny cigarette
Would you pass it back to me
I'm feeling a little down and out
And it'll keep me company
I'm just a long lost sinner
Living life here on the line
I'll give it right back to you
I know it's not really mine
Now don't put it out, not right yet
It's burning pretty good
Maybe I'll have one more toke
You think I should
OO-oo, days go by
I just sit around and get real high
OO-oo, what a glow
I just hang out, they come and go
Hey, the walls are starting to move
The floor is way down there
What a buzz it is
There's electricity in the air
Boy, I'm feeling really gone
I'm feeling really cool
I think I'll have another one
I'm just another fool
You know they say it's illegal
But what isn't these days
No matter what you do
There'll be somebody on your case
OO-oo, days go by
It just seems like I sit around and get high
OO-oo, shame on me
They're going to put me in a penitentiary
I must not be together
Look at the shape I'm in
I just know people are saying
"He's looking awful thin"
I guess I can count my blessings
Though I've always been this way
I guess I'll quit tomorrow
Maybe another day
OO-oo, days go by
I guess I'll sit around and get real high
You know time has no absolute
It's a just seems like it's spent
Everything has a tendency to be so warped and bent
While looking here and there
I'm surprised to see
Everybody's gone here
Everybody's gone but me
OO-oo, days go by
I just sit around and get real high
OO-oo, what a glow
I just hang out, they come and go
