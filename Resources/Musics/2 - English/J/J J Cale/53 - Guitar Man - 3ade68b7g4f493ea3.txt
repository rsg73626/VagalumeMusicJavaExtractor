GUITAR MAN

Guitar man, tell me what your secret am
Tell me please, can you put my mind at ease
When you're standing in the spotlight
With all the girls around
I was wondering how you do it
How you make that sound, guitar man
Tell me what your secret am
Tell me please, can you put my mind at ease
Your fingers move so swiftly
Across those silver strings
It looks so nice and easy
How you make it sing, guitar man
Tell me what your secret am
Tell me please, can you put my mind at ease
Guitar man, in a guitar jam
Playing low, playing slow
Playing loud, working the crowd
Playing high, you seem to fly
Guitar man, tell me what your secret am
Uh, hey man, have you seen my Stratocaster
Hand me that Gibson over there, will you
Let my try your Martin, man
Do you mind
Plug it in that Marshall
Turn it up a little bit louder
