LOU-EASY-ANN

Lou-Easy-Ann, I hear you calling back to me
Lou-Easy-Ann, I hear you calling back to me
Lord, I'm going back to New Orleans
Lou-Easy-Ann has set me free
Bourbon Street mama, you've never seen in your life
Bourbon Street mama, you keep it clean out of sight
Lord, I'm going back to New Orleans
Lou-Easy-Ann, you've got it right
Lou-Easy-Ann, ain't no woman quite like you
Lou-Easy-Ann, the way you do the things you do
Lord, I'm coming back to New Orleans
Lou-Easy-Ann, you've got me hooked on you
