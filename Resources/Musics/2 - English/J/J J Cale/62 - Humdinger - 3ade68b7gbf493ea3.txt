HUMDINGER

Humdinger, she loves to lick my finger
Humdinger, she loves to lick my finger
She rolls it 'round her tongue like a natural thing
She makes me feel like I'm a natural king
Humdinger, she loves to lick my finger
She got lips around me, painted red
She close her eyes when she rolls her head
Humdinger, she loves to lick my finger
Humdinger, she loves to lick my finger
