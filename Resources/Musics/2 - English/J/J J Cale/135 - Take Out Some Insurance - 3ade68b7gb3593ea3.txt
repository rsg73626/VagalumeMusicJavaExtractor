TAKE OUT SOME INSURANCE

A man knocked upon my door said
"Don't you know you're gonna die some day
And I got a plan for you man, for when you pass away
We'll give to your mother, your kids and your wife
And all you have to give in return is your life"
Take out some insurance, insurance today
For tomorrow will come and take us away
Two men were gamblin' in a parlour one night
When a woman walked in with her dress up so tight
She asked the two gentlemen would they fight for her name
They got up and shot her and went back to their game
Take out some insurance, insurance today
For tomorrow will come and take us away
This ain't no sad song, don't cry in your beer
For one day will come and we won't be here
Somebody else will take up our game
Different place, different name
Take out some insurance, insurance today
For tomorrow will come and take us away
For tomorrow will come and take us away
