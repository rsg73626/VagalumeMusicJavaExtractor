LIKE YOU USED TO

Cry me a tune in the morning, sing me the blues every night
Tell me that you really love me baby, and everything is alright
Let me know how you're feeling, it don't even have to be true
Just love me for ever, baby baby treat me like you used to
Home, I've been away from home, I'm a travelling man
Welcome me back any time, you are the only one who can
Tell me that you really love me, even if it ain't true
Just do anything, baby baby treat me like you used to
Home, I've been away from home, I'm a travelling man
Welcome me back any time, you are the only one who can
Tell me that you really love me, even if it ain't true
But do anything, baby baby treat me like you used to
