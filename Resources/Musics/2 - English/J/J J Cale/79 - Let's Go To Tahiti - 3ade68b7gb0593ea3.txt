LET'S GO TO TAHITI

Let's go to Tahiti
Let's go to Tahiti
Well, the man been working in the shop all year
He said "Men, we've got to get out of here"
Well, the girl been working in the five-and-dime
She says, "Girls, let's go while we've still got the time"
Let's go to Tahiti
Let's go to Tahiti
Tell the captain
"Put the rhum on the boat"
Everybody on board, let's see if she'll float
Let that old jet plane fly on by
We've got the time till the day we die
Let's go to Tahiti
Let's go to Tahiti
