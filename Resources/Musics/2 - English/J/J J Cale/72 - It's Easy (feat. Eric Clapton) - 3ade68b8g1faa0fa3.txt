IT'S EASY (FEAT. ERIC CLAPTON)

If you need a woman, in bed with you
Tell her in front, what you can do
It's easy
Easy as pie
You don't have to BS her, you don't have to lie
If you play the guitar, it won't be long, you'll be writin'
And singin' them songs
It's easy
Easy you bet
You'll be big, if you don't quit

If you feel kinda lonesome, no friends in sight
Get yourself a dog, it will be all right
Get yourself two, lucky you
One thing nice, it'll be there twice to love you
It's so easy
Getting through these times
So easy
With your life in mind

If a woman thinks she's ugly, or always depressed
She can go out and buy herself a new dress
It's easy
Easy my friend
Solves all of her problems, that's for sure
It's so easy
Getting through these times
So easy
With your life in mind

If cash is your problem, you might regret
Use that old plastic, slide two third in debt
It's easy
Easy you see
If tomorrow never comes, everything is free
So easy
Getting through these times
So easy
With your life in mind
It's so easy
Getting through these times
So easy
With your life in mind
