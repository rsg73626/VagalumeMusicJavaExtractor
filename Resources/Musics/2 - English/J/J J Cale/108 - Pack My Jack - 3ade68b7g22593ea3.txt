PACK MY JACK

Yes, I've been moving to the highway, rambling man keeps rambling on
Yes, I've been moving to the highway, rambling man keeps rambling on
Well, you can't seem to see it my way, pack my jack and I'll be gone
I said trouble, trouble follows easy, follows me everywhere I go
Trouble, trouble follows easy, follows me everywhere I go
I can't seem to shake old trouble, trouble got me down
Lord, I woke this morning feeling hazy, my good gal she done left and gone
Yes, I woke this morning feeling hazy, my good gal she done left and gone
She said I was dumb and lazy, ain't no truth in that at all
