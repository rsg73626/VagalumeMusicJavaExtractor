I'D LIKE TO LOVE YOU BABY

I'd like to love you baby and keep my other baby too
Put my arms around you, that's all I want to do
If the sun don't shine tomorrow, I know I've got you
I'd like to love you baby and keep my other baby too
Sometimes my baby's sleeping, sometimes she's not around
Sometimes I look to find her, I know she'll put me down
Oh, won't you let me hold you, let me lean on you
I'd like to love you baby and keep my other baby too
If the sun don't shine tomorrow, I know I've got you
I'd like to love you baby and keep my other baby too
