                     Thirteen days on a gig in the South.
                     We've got enough dope to keep us all around
                     We've got two girls dancin' to bring in a crowd
                     A sound man to mix us, make us sound loud
                     Sometimes we make money, sometimes I don't know
                     There's thirteen days with five to go
                     
                     There's Birmingham, Mobile, and up to Baton Rouge
                     We're smokin' cigarettes and reefer, drinkin' coffee and 
booze
                     I saw the sun go down in Atlanta, come up in New Orleans
                     I got to know a waitress, I tried to get in her jeans
                     Sometimes we make money, sometimes I don't know
                     There's thirteen days with five to go
                     
                     Migrant Worker is the name of this band
                     If we're ever in your town, come see us if you can
                     Yeah, we been to New Orleans, we been to New York
                     Some take to the magazines, some take to dope
                     Sometimes we make money, sometimes I don't know
                     Thirteen days with five to go
