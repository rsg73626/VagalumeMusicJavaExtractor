ARTIFICIAL PARADISE

Many loves in a lifetime, they seem to go astray
Many people come and go, they never seem to stay
Sometimes I kid myself, then I realise
I'm just living in an artificial paradise
A hundred times, my hopes and dreams are blown into the air
A thousand times, it always seems no one is really there
Then I know I'm fooling myself, I'm not so wise
I'm just living in an artificial paradise
Plastic state of mind, superficial clothes
Living in a vacuum, close to zero
Sometimes I kid myself, then I realise
I'm just living in an artificial paradise
