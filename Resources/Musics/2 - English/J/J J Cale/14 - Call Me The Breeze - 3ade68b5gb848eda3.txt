CALL ME THE BREEZE

You can call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
You can call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I ain't carryin' me no load

Ain't no changin' the weather
Ain't no changin' me
Ain't no changin' the weather
Ain't no changin' me
I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' fom me

I got that green light babe
I gotta keep movin' on
I got that green light babe
I gotta keep movin' on
I might go up to Califonia
Might go down to Georgia
I don't know.
