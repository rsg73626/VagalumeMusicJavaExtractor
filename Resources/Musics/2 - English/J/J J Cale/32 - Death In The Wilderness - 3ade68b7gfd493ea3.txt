DEATH IN THE WILDERNESS

Death in the wilderness
It's a hopeless case I guess
Who's looking out for the wilder side
It will soon all be gone
You can tell it won't be long
We'll find the wilderness has died
We'll be the lonely one
Concrete, plastic human throng
Tellin' one another have you heard the news
We'll mow it down, we'll rape the ground
'Til there's nothing left to abuse
The rabbit, he'll be gone
The bird will sing no song
The wolf, the bear, the lion too
The insect far and near, creatures like the deer
We'll put in cages a the zoo
Death in the wilderness
It's a hopeless case I guess
Who's looking out for the wilder side
It will soon all be gone
You can tell it won't be long
We'll find the wilderness has died
The stream will all dry out
The fish, gone no doubt
We'll have no animals to fear
The tree will be no more
We'll use it to build the store
Mountain scene will disappear
These changes takin' place
Will affect the human race
We'll all know it when it's gone
God save this planet now
We've got to help somehow
We've left it happen way too long
Death in the wilderness
It's a hopeless case I guess
Who's looking out for the wilder side
It will soon all be gone
You can tell it won't be long
We'll find the wilderness has died
We'll find the wilderness has died
