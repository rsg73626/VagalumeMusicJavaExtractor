LONESOME TRAIN

Lonesome train, ride all day
Lonesome train, ride all day
Since I lost my woman, I lost my way
Mr Conductor, where is this train bound
Mr Conductor, where is this train bound
Is it headed up, is it headed down
Lucky for me, I'm on the sunny side
Lucky for me, I'm on the sunny side
Since I lost my woman, it's a lonesome ride
Lonesome train, ride all day
Lonesome train, ride all day
Since I lost my woman, I lost my way
