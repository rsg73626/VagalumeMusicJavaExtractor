SHE'S IN LOVE

She hangs around with another guy
I met only yesterday
He's a hard cold cooker, a fine looker
He took that woman away
He took my woman away
She's in love, she's in love with another man
That's the way it goes 
She's in love, she's in love with another man
A hard cold cooker, he really shook her
If you see her, it really shows
He drives a fine set of wheels, let me tell you
He's got diamonds in his ears
He's a real jim-dandy, with her he's so handy
Such a scene, make you break out in tears
Such a scene, make you break out in tears
She's in love, she's in love with another man
That's the way it goes
She's in love, she's in love with another man
A hard cold cooker, he really shook her
If you see her, it really shows
If you see her, tell her I still love her
No matter what, no matter when
It will be a good day when he goes away
And she comes back round again
And she comes back round again
She's in love, she's in love with some other man
That's the way it goes
She's in love, she's in love with another man
A hard cold cooker, he really shook her
If you see her, it really shows
