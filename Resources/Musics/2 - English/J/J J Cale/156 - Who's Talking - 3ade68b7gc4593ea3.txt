WHO'S TALKING

Who's talking, ain't no friend of mine
Who's talking, stirred it up
Who's talking, who's lying
Hard rumours, hard rumours, pay no mind
When you abuse and you spread your rumours
Somebody's talking, somebody's lying
Find out look who is shouting
When they say you've got to talk
Watch out
Some day you're going to have a trouble
Who's talking, ain't no friend of mine
Who's talking, stirred it up
Who's talking, who's lying
