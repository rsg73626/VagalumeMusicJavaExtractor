UNEMPLOYMENT

Beating down the pavement, looking for a job
I'll do anything except steal and rob
Unemployment is something I can't use
If you can't use me, can you tell me some good news
I'll be pretty simple, hear just what I say
I'll do anything to send these blues away
Unemployment is something I can't use
If you can't help me, can you tell us some good news
You won't have to pay me overtime, overtime and all that
You just tell me what time and where at
Unemployment is something I can't use
If you can't help me, can you tell me some good news
I'll do anything at all, anything at all to be a friend
You know I'm real prompt, I'm right on time
Unemployment is something I can't use
If you can't help me, can you tell me some good news
