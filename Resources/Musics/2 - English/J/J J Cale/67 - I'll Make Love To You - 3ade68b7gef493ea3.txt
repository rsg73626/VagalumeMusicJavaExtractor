I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU

I can't read and I can't write
And I don't know my left from right
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine
But I'll make love to you any old time
I can't swim and I can't fly
I ain't no fish, I ain't no bird in the sky
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine
But I'll make love to you any old time
I can't count from one to ten
And I don't know the shape I'm in
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine
But I'll make love to you any old time
