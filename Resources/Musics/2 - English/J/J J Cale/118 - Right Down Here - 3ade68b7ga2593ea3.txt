RIGHT DOWN HERE

My woman, my woman, you know she cryin'
She keeps me hanging on a bottle of wine
She leaves no roads open, there ought to be a law
She puts me right down here
She keeps me right down here
She holds me right down here
Lord, I talk and talk about her, can't get her off my mind
Cannot live without her, she keeps me on this wine
She leaves no roads open, there ought to be a law
She puts me right down here
She holds me right down here
She keeps me right down here
Lord, I talk and talk about her, can't get her off my mind
Cannot live without her, she keeps me on that wine
She leaves no roads open, there ought to be a law
She put me right down here
She keep me right down here
She hold me right down here
She puts me right down here
She holds me right down here
She keeps me right down here
