MOTORMOUTH

Rattlin' rattlin' rattlin' round, all this talk and making sounds
Talkin' fast, talkin' low, we called him Motormouth
He say you called, he say it's you, it's anything that you can use
If you need it, need it now, he'll be there, Motormouth
I know you see him everywhere, in your face he's always here
If you try to back away, he'll just say, "Hey!

Gotta a tip for you man, listen to the understanding
Now if you can't endure the life, I'm Motormouth, I'm on your side"
He's real quick to advise, stretch the truth and tell you lies
Never, never talkin' slow, Motormouth is on the go
Needs some paper really quick, he'll take you down his mini slate
He's got the balls, he's got the clout, alway talkin', Motormouth
I know you see him everywhere, in your face he's always here
If you try to back away, he'll just say, "Hey!

Gotta a tip for you man, listen to the understanding
Now if you're down the road of life, I'm Motormouth, I'm on your side"
Rattlin' rattlin' rattlin' round, all this talk and making sounds
Talkin' fair, let's talk tomorrow, we called him Motormouth
