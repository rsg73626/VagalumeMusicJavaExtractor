WOKE UP THIS MORNING

I woke up early this morning
There wasn't a cloud in the sky
I walked up to the window
If I had wings I could fly

Everything looked like a garden
The wonder of it all
Reflection of the sun on the water
Looked like a crystal ball

The blue sky covers dimensions
Beyond what my eyes could see
Stretch my imagination
Totally free

The time was only a moment
Spreadin' like a lighting rod
I know I saw for a moment
The hand of God

As if he'd painted a picture
And put it on my window pane
What I saw this morning
I'll never ever see again
