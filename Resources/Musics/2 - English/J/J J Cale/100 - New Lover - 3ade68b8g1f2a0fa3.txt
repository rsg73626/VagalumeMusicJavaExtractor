NEW LOVER

She's on the grounds, that's what they say
I heard the news only yesterday
She's on the prowl like a siamese cat
I hope I'm where it's at
She's got a lover
It's a guarantee
That her new lover
It ain't me
She's got a lover
That's what I'm told
She got a lover
I'm out in the cold
She's on the grounds, that's what they say
I heard the news only yesterday
She's on the prowl like a siamese cat
I must not be where it's at
She's got a lover
Puts her in a trance
She's got a lover
I ain't got a chance
She's got a lover
It's a guarantee
That her new lover
It ain't me
She's got a lover
That's what i'm told
She got a lover
I'm out in the cold
