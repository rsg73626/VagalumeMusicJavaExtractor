JAILER

Low-light moonlight comes through my window
But these steel bars spoil the view
You know that jailer thinks I'm guilty
He don't know that I'm passing through
Ain't no service in this prison
Ain't no women I can see
Doin' my time now, I been waiting
For that jailer, set me free
Lord that jailer, walks around here
Like he owns my very soul
You know that jailer's got the key
Be so easy, let me go
