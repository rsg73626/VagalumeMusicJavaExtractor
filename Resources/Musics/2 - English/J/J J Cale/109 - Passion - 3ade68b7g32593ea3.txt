PASSION

Whatever happened to ole what's-her-name
She used to be the big part of my game
Now she's gone, but her passion is still in me
I still remember the way she wore her hair
Man, we used to go most everywhere
Now she's gone, but her passion still lies in me
Some call her a shady lady, others around her
All I know, is I'm sure glad I found her
Even though she's gone, her passion still is in me
They say she drifted on to another place
You know I just can't forget her face
Even though she's gone, her passion still lies in me
