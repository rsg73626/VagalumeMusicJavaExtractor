NEW ORLEANS

Have you ever been down to New Orleans
Lord, lord, them crazy queens
Crying the blues is what they do down there
Fortune teller, he knows your name
Fortune teller, he'll tell you your game
Crying the blues, that's what they do down there
Money dripping from a willow tree
He never want me
Lazy bones, I ain't got a dime
Just biding my time
If I find a way to choose
New Orleans, where they're crying the blues
Drinking bourbon from a dixie cup
Hanging out till the sun comes up
Crying the blues is what they do down there
French women, all I need
Up and down old Bourbon Street
Crying the blues is what they do down there
If I find a way to choose
New Orleans, where they're singing the blues
