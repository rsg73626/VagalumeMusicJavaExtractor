END OF THE LINE

Trains don't run forever
Fire goes out sometime
Gotta tell you, baby
We've come to the end of the line
Pages of yesterday
Fill this book of mine
Gotta tell you, baby
It is the end of the line
I can't remember those good old days
They are from a different time
I gotta tell you, baby
We've come to the end of the line
