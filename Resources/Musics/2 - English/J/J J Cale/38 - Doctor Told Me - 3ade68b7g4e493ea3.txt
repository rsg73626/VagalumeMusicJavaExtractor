DOCTOR TOLD ME

Well my heart ain't in it
My mind is blank
Can't seem to function
Can't seem to think
Doctor told me cure your ills
Get yourself a woman boy that'll pay your bills
Have her clean your house, make your bed
Rub your bottom down, hold your head
Get yourself a lover, a friend and a wife
Get yourself a woman boy, get yourself a life
Doctor told me
Doctor told me
Doctor told me get yourself a life
Well, I got out on the street and I looked around
here come a woman, she was fine and brown
I said "Come here baby, my name is Bob
I'm a long, tall lover, but I ain't got no job"
Doctor told me (I told her)
Doctor told me
Doctor told me get yourself a life
Well she looked at me with a sparkle in her eye
Told me I was crazy, told me I was high
"Get outta here", she said, "or I'll cut you with my knife"
You better be gone boy, get yourself a life
Doctor told me
Doctor told me (I told her)
Doctor told me get yourself a life
Here I'm standin' 'round a lonesome old house
Ain't got nobody, ain't got no spouse
I sure fell bad, i sure feel blue
One thing I sure feel, I'm sure needin' you
Doctor told me
Doctor told me
Doctor told me get yourself a life
