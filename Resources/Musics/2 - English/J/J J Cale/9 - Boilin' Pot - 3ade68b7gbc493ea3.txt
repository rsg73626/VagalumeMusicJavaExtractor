BOILIN' POT

Now she don't know where she is, how sexy she can be
She don't realise what her eyes do to me
She keeps me hot, like a boilin' pot
She whispers in my ear, "Let's do it right here"
The ways of a wantin' woman aren't a mystery
The style she has will never fade as long as she's havin' me
She keeps me hot, like a boilin' pot
She whispers in my ear, "Let's do it right here"
She keeps me hot, like a boilin' pot
Burning right through the night
It don't take long for her to catch my eye
When she wants to suck me in, it's easy as pie
She keeps me hot, like a boilin' pot
Burning right through the night
