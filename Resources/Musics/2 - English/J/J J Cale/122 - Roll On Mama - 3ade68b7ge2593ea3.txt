ROLL ON MAMA

Jump in woman, now the jumpin' is right
I'm the kind of man don't sleep at night
Heart gets a-beatin' when a place sound funky
I gotta roll on, Mama
Things been movin' too slow
Hesitatin', reservatin', making my move
Rotatin', motivatin', I gotta go
Feet keep a-walking and your mouth keep a-talking, you know
I gotta roll on, Mama
Things been movin' too slow
Until you measure my height and my size
If I don't die runnin', I won't be alive
Give me my things, show me to the door
I gotta roll on, Mama
I can't hang no more
I take your Cadillac DeVille with a continental kit
Rollin' down the highway, and then I feel
Fakin', shakin', that's all I know
I gotta roll on, Mama
Things been movin' too slow
