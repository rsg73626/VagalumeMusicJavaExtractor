CAN'T LIVE HERE

Well you can't live here like this anymore
No you can't live here like this anymore
No you can't live here like this
Cause your man he ain't gonna like it
No you can't live here like this anymore
What's your mama gonna say about you when you get home
What's your mama gonna say about you when you get home
She's gonna whip your butt for sure now
She's gonna wonder what you do now
What's your mama gonna say about you when you get home
You better slip on across that fence where you belong
You better get on back there quick before they know you're gone
No you can't live here like this
Cause your people ain't gonna like it
No you can't live here like this anymore
