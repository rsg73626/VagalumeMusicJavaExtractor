HARD TIMES

Hard times is about to get me
Hard times, they hurt my hands
Hard times, it took my woman
Hard times lead her to a richer man
Caught in the middle of some fool's advice
If you work real hard, you get a piece of the pie
Can't you hear that laughing
No, the jokes don't end
Consider my resources, it's a hard time to eat
Hard times, it's rough all around
Hard times, it's all gonna end
Hard times, just thinking about it
Consider my resources, it's a hard time to eat
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
