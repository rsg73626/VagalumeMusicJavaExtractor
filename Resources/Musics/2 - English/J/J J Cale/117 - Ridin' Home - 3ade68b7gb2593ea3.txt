RIDIN' HOME

I'm sittin' on this train and I'm ridin' home, ridin' home
I'm sittin' on this train and I'm ridin' home, ridin' home
I've got my bag and I'm ready to go
I wish this train didn't move so slow
I'm sittin' on this train and I'm ridin' home, ridin' home
This train don't move like it used to, ridin' home
This train don't move like it used to, ridin' home
This train don't move down the railroad track
Fast enough to get my baby back
This train don't move like it used to, ridin' home
