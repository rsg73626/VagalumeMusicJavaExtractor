LONG WAY HOME

Early in the morning, about a quarter to four
Me and my girlfriend walkin' out the door
We're heading for the car and we got right in
And that's when I noticed the shape she was in
She turned to me and said right out
Let's steer it awhile, let's steer it about
Take the long way home, take the long way home
Make this night last
Well we drove down town and up in the woods
We drove around and around till I understood
I was holding the wheel, she was making out
And all this time I was driving about
She was fondling my hair and hugging my neck
And all I was thinking was, oh what the heck
Take the long way home, take the long way home
Make this night last
I was looking in the mirror and to my surprise
There was two big red lights shining in my eyes
I pull over and he drove alongside
And out of his car and up to my right
He looked at her and she looked at him
And the next thing I noticed he got right in
Take the long way home, take the long way home
Make this night last
Take the long way home, take the long way home
Take the long way home, take the long way home
Make this night last
