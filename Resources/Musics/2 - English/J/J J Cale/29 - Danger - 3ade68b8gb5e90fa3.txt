DANGER

Danger
She's out into the night
Danger
She's such a pretty sight
She was treated so badly it seems
Now she's looking full of dreams

Danger
She's out into the night
Danger
She walks the streets alone
Danger
All above she now knows
All the men that look her way
Could be hers, hers today

Danger
She's out into the night
Locked into a love affair
Didn't seem to go nowhere
With no choice she thought she might
Rush out of the way and rowd into the night

Danger
She walks the streets alone
All above she now knows
All the men that look her way
Could be hers today
The risk you take, defines your moment
She don't know where, or whom
She wants to do, doing it right
She's going out, to the night

Danger
She's out into the night
Danger
She's such a pretty sight
Danger
She's out into the night
Danger
She's such a pretty sight
Danger
She's out into the night
Danger
She's such a pretty sight
