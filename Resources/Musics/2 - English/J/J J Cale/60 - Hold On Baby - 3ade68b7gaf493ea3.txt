HOLD ON BABY

I've got a fine-looking woman, she's fine and brown
She likes to boogie in the kitchen, likes to boogie 'round town
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Hold on baby, you're moving too fast for me
Talking about that woman, she's up early in the morning
Making love with me before the break of dawn
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Hold on baby, you're moving too fast for me
Every night about twelve o'clock
She starts making love to me till I think I'm gonna drop
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Hold on baby, you're moving too fast for me
She's a fine-looking woman, she's fine, no doubt
Everything I need but she's wearing me out
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Hold on baby, you're moving too fast for me
Don't get me wrong, I'm a-tellin' you right
Since I met her I get no sleep at night
Hold on baby, hold on baby
Hold on baby, you're moving too fast for me
