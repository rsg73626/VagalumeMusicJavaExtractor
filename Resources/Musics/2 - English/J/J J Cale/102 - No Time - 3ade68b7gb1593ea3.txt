NO TIME

No time for making my moves, no time
No time for hitting my groove, no time
Summer comes and summer gone
When I sing the very same song
Set apart of all the scene
How we long for all our dreams
No time for making no moves, no time
No time for hitting no grooves, no time
The clock it turns at a rapid pace
Takes us to another place
The train it goes from here to there
Just left me standing here
No time for making my moves, no time
No time for hitting my grooves, no time
I had the blues this morning I cried all day
I guess you lose the blues in the morning If you cry 'em away
No time for making my moves, oh no time
No time for hitting my grooves, no, no time
