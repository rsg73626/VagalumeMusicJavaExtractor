LIVIN' HERE TOO

Don't ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
I was born in a freight train passin' by
My mother was poor, my father too
I'll take anything I can get from you
I did not make this old world, I'm just livin' here too
Been shot three times runnin', cut with a knife
I got four children working, ain't got no wife
Well, the landlord is callin', I'm overdue
If you don't watch my fingers I'll put the touch on you
I did not make this old world, I'm just livin' here too
I didn't make this old world, I'm just livin' here too

Turn around slowly, look behind
I'm comin' from nowhere and not by design
I didn't make this old world, I'm just livin' here too
I didn't make this old world, I'm just livin' here too
