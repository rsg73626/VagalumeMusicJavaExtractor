ROSE IN THE GARDEN

I'll find my way back to the rose in the garden
I'll find my way back to her sweet arms
I'll find my way back to the rose in the garden
I'll find my way back to her little charms
Wasting my life, just dreaming away
No never again will I ever stray
I'll find my way back to the rose in the garden
I'll find my way back to her sweet arms
Wasting my life, just dreaming away
No never again will I ever stray
I'll find my way back to the rose in the garden
I'll find my way back to her sweet arms
