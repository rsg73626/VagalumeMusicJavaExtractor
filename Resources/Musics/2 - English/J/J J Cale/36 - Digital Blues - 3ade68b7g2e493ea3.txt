DIGITAL BLUES

I got the digital blues, my soul is just another number
I got the digital blues, my soul is just another number
You check it out, we're all the same
You check it out, we're one again
I got the digital blues, my soul is just another number
Three forty-four point six, is that really me
Three forty-four point six, you're kidding me
How did we get into the shape we're in
I check it out, I'm one again
I got the digital blues, my soul is just another number
In the year thirty-two thirty-two, how will they remember me
In the year thirty-two thirty-two, how will they remember me
My appetite will be a digital code
Information in the new code
I got the digital blues, my soul is just another number
I got the digital blues, my soul is just another number
