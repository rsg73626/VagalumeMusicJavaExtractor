TOO MUCH FOR ME

Somebody touched me late last night
Had this woman and I still feel right
Some kind of feeling up and down my spine
Plays with my head and mess with my mind
She tickled my toe and she kissed my ear
Told me not to worry, told me not to fear
Oo-wee, she felt good to me
Gotta have another, just like the other
Last night brother was too much for me
I felt like a junkie couldn't score no dope
I buzzed the brass then I lost all hope
Laying down woman, she got me too hot
We had a little drink, and we smoked a little pot
All I knew was something happened to me
I was unsuspicious as anyone could be
She set me on fire, I'm telling you
Let me tell you brother, I didn't know what to do
Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's not
Sometimes you get it and sometimes you're got
Oo-wee, it felt good to me
Gotta have another, just like the other
Last night brother was too much for me
