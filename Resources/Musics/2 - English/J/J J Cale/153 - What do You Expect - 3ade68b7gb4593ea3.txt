WHAT DO YOU EXPECT

Well, I quit my high living just for you
Made you number one while I was number two
Set the weight of a hangman, to keep you satisfied
Times you dogged around on me and lied, lied, lied
What do you expect
Caviar and candlelight
What do you expect
Champagne every night
Well, you come home in the morning, quarter to two
Slide into the bedroom, want me to make love to you
I can take your jiving, can play it all cool
But I can't keep from knowing you think I'm a fool, fool, fool
What do you expect
Santa Claus at Christmas time
What do you expect
Bouquet of roses for your time
Yeah, now two days been gone since you been here
You've been hanging out, I don't know, I don't care
Change my way of living, gotta be stepping out that door
You won't find me here when you come back for more
What do you expect
Cadillac and a chauffeur too
What do you expect
Just another fool for you
Sometimes we do it and sometimes we don't
I can't wait no longer just to get to the point
What do you expect
Beating my head against the wall
What do you expect
You want to take it all
