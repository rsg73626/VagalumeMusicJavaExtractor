IF I HAD A ROCKET

If I had me a rocket
I'd fly off to the moon
If I had me a rocket, boy
I'd fly off to the moon
It's getting so crowded here
I can't find no room
People, lots of people
Coming out of the walls
People, lots of people
Coming out of the walls
When there's too many people
Ain't no room at all
You can't hide out no more
Satellite will track you down
You can't hide out no more
Satellite will track you down
You can't run from your neighbors
There's a neighbors all around
If I had me a rocket
I'd fly off to the moon
If I had me a rocket, boy
I'd fly off to the moon
It's getting so crowded here
I can't find no room
