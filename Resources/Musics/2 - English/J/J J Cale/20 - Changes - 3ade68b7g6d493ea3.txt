CHANGES

How can you put me through these changes
Why do you do me like you do
It ain't no way
I love-a-dee love nobody but you
Let him go out and get with strangers
Don't you turn my love to hate
Ain't no man can love you like I can, and I do
How can you put me through these changes
Why do you do me like you do
It ain't no way
I love-a-dee love nobody but you
