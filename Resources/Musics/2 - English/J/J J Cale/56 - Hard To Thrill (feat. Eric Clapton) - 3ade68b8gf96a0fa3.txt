HARD TO THRILL (FEAT. ERIC CLAPTON)

Hard to thrill
Nothing really moves me anymore
Hard to thrill
Nothing really moves me anymore

There is nothing you can show me
That I haven't seen before
I've got time to kill
Keeping to myself inside this room
Time to kill
Keeping to myself inside this room
Over forty years of fridays
You would give up trying too

Hard to thrill
Nothing really moves me anymore
I'm hardly thrilled
Nothing really moves me anymore

There is nothing you can show me
That I haven't seen before
Hard to thrill
Nothing really moves me anymore
Hard to thrill
Nothing really moves me anymore
