I'LL KISS THE WORLD GOODBYE

I've been so lonely in these prison walls
Good lord, thinking I would die
You've got the time to get me out
I'll kiss this world goodbye
I've taken some things I don't really need
I've wandered out any pride
Just wave me off, I'll leave without doubt
I'll kiss this world goodbye
The rain will fall and I need a woman
Lord, I think I'm gonna die
I've taken some things I don't really need
I've wandered out any pride
Just wave me off, I'll leave without doubt
I'll kiss this world goodbye
