LOSERS

Losers, we're just losers
Exclusive club that we're in
Losers, we're just losers
Why don't losers ever win
Came in this morning to spread the word around
Nobody wants to hear what a loser's putting down
Losers, we're just losers
Why don't losers ever win
Been out a-wanderin', bad luck all around
Can't you help a loser get up off the ground
