BLUES FOR MAMA

Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
It just seems wrong, to sing this song
'cos she's not here, where she belongs
Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
Rest her soul, she's grown so cold
Her touch is like the winter snow
Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
She went away only yesterday
I cound't help
What can I say
Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
She made her run
She can't be done
She's the only one
Blues for Mama
Blues for Mama
