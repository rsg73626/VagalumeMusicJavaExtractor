SOULIN'

I sure like your movin'
It's got me to groovin'
I can't wait a minute
You can't condescending
Your slow rollin', rollin'
You got me to soulin'
It's worth more than money
So get down on it, honey
Just keep right on cookin'
You know I'm a-lookin'
It's worth more than money
So get down on it, honey
I sure like your movin'
It's got me to groovin'
Your slow rollin', rollin'
You got me to soulin'
