LOW RIDER

She is my low rider
She is my low rider
Some say she's bad, but she's better than no rider
She carries a .45 on her hip
She takes no bother, she takes no lip
So put your hands on my rider today
She is my low rider
She is my low rider
Some say she's bad, but she's better than no rider
In the morning, I get my kicks
When she shows me all her tricks
A love of mine, you know she's fine, I say
She is my low rider
She is my low rider
Some say she's bad, but she's better than no rider
