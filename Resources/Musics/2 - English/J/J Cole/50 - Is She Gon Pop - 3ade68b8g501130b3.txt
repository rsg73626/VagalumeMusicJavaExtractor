IS SHE GON POP

Yeah
Yeah

[verse 1: j. cole]
Art of seduction
Hoes jump like vince carter backstage
Like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams
You gotta start off with somethin'
Her momma went to college
But yet her father was hustlin'
Found it funny cuz now they daughter is stuck-in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I dont hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I dont care for the nigga
Well, movin on
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs
But I love when they come on
Word?

[hook: j. cole]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know whats on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted
Look in the blocks with mindplay?
Im in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, how could you not taste it?

[verse 2: j. cole]
That's a little egotistic, my amigos be hocking in toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all g
Cause he know bitches can't get the michael
So they settling for tito
We know, yeah nigga we know
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappucino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me
You keep on putting bitches over money
But that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper
Just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half
Of what they put in chasing ass into a craft
By now you'd be famous and rich
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch
While you play with her pussy
And let her play with your dick
She thinking she got a first round pick
She thinking bout all the things
She can get, she thinking you got a range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches
And they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word
Wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs... aye
