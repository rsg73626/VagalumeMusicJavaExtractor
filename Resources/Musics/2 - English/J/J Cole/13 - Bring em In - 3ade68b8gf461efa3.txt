BRING EM IN

[Bridge]
I wasn’t looking for you
I wasn’t searching
I wasn’t creeping around
I wasn’t lurking
I wasn’t sleeping around
I wasn’t thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1]
You on ya job, and it damn sure workin’
Say she ain’t a ho but she far from a virgin
When it time to cut ‘em somethin’ like a surgeon
I do my thang for you, hey
Baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make ya man think I put you in bally
If I’m sliding threw ya city I need you to dail me
And how much my niggas smoke reminded me of friday
I can take you to Dc introduce tou to wale
You can look all threw my phone as long as you dont call Jay
Is it cool to parlay, We can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room
We call this to the hard way? Hard way!

[hook]
I put it down
Any spot any city that im in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot any city that im in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the …. its just me, you, and them

[verse 2]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin’ like you knew Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thing for you x2
A stewardess yet you flew the Lear
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for you
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catching bodies
How im stretching you no need to go to Pilates?
When im sliding thru ya city meet me in the lobby
Then you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? While you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin’ wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a high way
But if I tell you get to stepping like you came un-timely
Dont mind me, I put it down!

[hook]
I put it down
Any spot any city that im in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot any city that im in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the… its just me, you, and them

[verse 3
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the four seasons
Whisper to ya home girls ya love cole world
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse
You know the type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than nerf football
I got his girl lip gloss all on my girth
But cause Im so cleaver better than who ever
The coldest nigga even when wearin’ like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It’s, O eleven, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up and so I had to blow and I ain’t talking
Coke header, I won’t let up

[hook]
I put it down
Any spot any city that im in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot any city that im in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the …. its just me, you, and them
