SIMBA

[verse]
Straight out the ville and I made it
Like a villain I'm hated
I see 'em grillin', I ate it though
Finna blow inflatable, that's undebatable (ugh)
I'm givin niggas food for thought
The flow is catered yo
I'm never faded though
Haters wanna see me broke
But me and the dough related ho!
It's like my only son, where I go, he come!
Niggas dumb to be braggin bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas
I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin like the light-skin version
Of the very same baby
That the virgin mary raised
That's word to everything!
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin
You sucka niggas lie in everything
That ya sayin
Shame on ya'll
You tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on ya'll
Ya'll stain ya'll draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection
Lethal weapons, and they aim on ya'll
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale
I excel in this rap shit
Cause ya'll spittin that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin bout
That trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat
The cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets
I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin for the freaks and the dimes
And I shine like a mothafuckin diamond
You shine like a mothafuckin dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin on that nigga
Nigga get it straight
I'm spittin hungry
Like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga
Hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin
It hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga
Ever seen around was huxtable
And so the muscle flow
Is something you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz will grow
Ballin til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin money til my pockets
Need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell
You meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga
Check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga
Young simba!
Word on the streets
Is I'm the prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga
Young simba!
