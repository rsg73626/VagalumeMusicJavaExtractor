TOO DEEP FOR THE INTRO

Yeah
Hey
Yeah

Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like lunchables
Like white boys in grade school
While we ate school made food just
Eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn’t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man
Thats just life thats how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt
Even if its with cupid
He beat you and you went back
You’s officially stupid
Oh yeah I understand thats your man
You had a plan
You been together for some years
You sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears but we both know thats a bad look
Cause 20 years from now your daughter will probably get her ass whooped
If this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole, cole, cole

[Hook]
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back

If this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and muthaf-ckers that hated school
Said thats for busters that heard my shit and I made it cool
This ain't to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
And possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout
I used that ass for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin out my blinds
Till I got free from my momma leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play
Pardon me, whats your name, don’t mistake me for no lame
No not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I’d be
In the club dappin’ niggas, eventually R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some
That just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down
