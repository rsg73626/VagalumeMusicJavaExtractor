THE CUT OFF (FEAT. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​KILL EDWARD)

I know heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down

I know heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Yeah

Give me drink, give me smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, gentle now
Give me drink, give me dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Give me drink, give me smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a clown, coming down
Put me down, gentle now
Give me drink, give me dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
