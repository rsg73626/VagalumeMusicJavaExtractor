DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL

Hey...

Her mind is on a different level.
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel.
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin with the devil.
She fuck, she suck, she swallow.
Man, it's like a triple double.
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble.
Just because they fuck ya, girl, don't mean them niggas love ya.

She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up... is that a bottle on your
Table, well if so... then pour it up. Bet you I can drink it straight
Without even throwin up."

She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl, you're growin up, growin
Up."

Hey... and take a couple of shots and it's on.

"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin up." She said "Daddy,
What you think?" "Little girl, you're growin up, growin up."

Hey, listen baby girl they playin your song.

Mama couldn't never reach her.
Brother tried his best to teach her.
She thinks she's ready for the world.
Just look at daddy's little girl.

You lost to lookin for a savior, I ain't Mario.

Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though.
Make me wonder where your father go?

She said, "Don't analyze me nigga, hold up. Is that green on your table?
Well if so then roll it up. I can take it to the face without even throwin
Up."

She said "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin up, growin up."
