BLOW UP

Laaa la la laaaa
La la laaaa

Hey, this is a song for my haters,
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah
Hey, this is a song for my haters,
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah

Haa, bitch I'm about to blow up
Uh huh, say what
Bitch I'm about to blow up
Hey I came up, I warmed up the next up
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Now don't it sound legendary
Liven up the ressurected dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary

Uh, I'm blowing up and bitch I'm still me
But what's the cost to live your dreams, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money changed and whips make me feel free

I'm starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters I'm headed to the place you like to go
They say, "what you fighting for, the game is on life support"
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short

Bitch I'm about to blow up, look I'm about to blow up
Yeah got to the club early just to get a friend, 
Wait for hoes to show up
Man, but now it's bottles at them tables, 
Bring the models boy I'm about to po' up
Uh huh, you know what, bitch I'm about to blow up

Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Right side right side ah ha)
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Bitch I'm about to blow up)

Hey, this is a song for my haters 
(Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah 
(Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters 
(Uh huh, look I'm about to blow up)
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah
Yeah, bitch I'm about to blow up

Momma said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and be a troop and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree but what that cost you
You make a good salary just to pay Sally May
That's real as ever

Ducking bill collectors like Jehova's witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low, lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for

Summers dead it got me drinking thinking bitch I better blow
I better blow,
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl what it look like
And where ya head at, and what ya cook like
She said where ya bread at, and what your whip like
You ain't got one or the other than brother good night

Bitch I'm about to blow up, look I'm about to blow up
Yeah got to the club early just to get a friend, 
Wait for hoes to show up
But now it's bottles at the tables bring the models, 
Boy I'm about to po' up
Uh ha, you know what
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Right side right side ah ha)
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)
La la laaaa (Bitch I'm about to blow up)

Hey, this is a song for my haters (Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah (Uh, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Yeah, bitch I'm about to blow up)
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah
Bitch I'm about to blow up!

Praise God it's hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit

Well damn, why ain't you say so
Take this shaking ass multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phone of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it's case closed

To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You'll never be me partner so it don't fucking matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you that's what it sounds, beautiful

Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit but you know what
For now bitch I'm about to blow up
