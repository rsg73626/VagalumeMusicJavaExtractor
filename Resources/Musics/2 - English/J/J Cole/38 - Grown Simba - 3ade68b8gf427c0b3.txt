GROWN SIMBA

Now I was dreaming bout a deal
At the age of 13
I was feignin for the meals
I ain't talkin burger king
Some of my niggas
In the 'ville all they did was serve things
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals
Spend their time flirting
All they wanted was some waves
Like they fuckin surfin
Hold up now, don't get it twisted
I ain't hatin, do ya thing
I was like a young simba
Couldn't wait to be the king
Now a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence
Where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass way meaner
Somethin like sarina mixed
With trina have you seen her?
She fine enough to be ms. howard, word to edina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now it's time to eat
I'm lettin all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me
Now they actin like they know me
Keep on sayin, where ya goin nigga

Shit, it ain't no tellin
Ey where ya goin nigga
Ey, it ain't no tellin
They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga
Goin nigga
It ain't no tellin
Can't tell ya where I'm goin
Just know I won't stop
Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top

Pardon the interruption
A proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary
Man, greedy niggas wouldn't let me in
The cafeteria and
Cause they ain't believe
Suddenly they presbyterian
The hoes is librarians, they lookin me up
She got a jones like marion, she lickin me up
Then we cut, look at how she say my name
I got her moanin j. cole
They used to say jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin
Six feet, shits deep
I was low, just a dolla and some hope, fix me
Cause I was broke, plus the weed
That I would smoke would make it worser
Lord please let my problems disappear
Like ron mercer
I'm a star, converses conversin
With them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
Cause my shit is unheard of
Like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though
Now they yellin, where ya goin nigga

Shit, it ain't no tellin
Ey where ya goin nigga
Shit, it ain't no tellin
They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga
Goin nigga
It ain't no tellin
Can't tell ya where I'm goin
Just know I won't stop
Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top

I left the city for a minute
But it's still on my back
Told my niggas
Ey I'm finna put the 'ville on the map
I'll be back
And I'm comin with a deal and a plaque
Cause I'm I'll bitch
They couldn't make a pill for the rap
Pourin liquor for my niggas
That was kissin em back
Came home, shit is real
Niggas still in the trap
Hold up now, don't get it twisted
If you slang do ya thang
Me I'm like a young simba
I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that carolina water
I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas
Tryin to be the ballers
Ain't no fathers
But the skinny niggas tryin hit they daughters
Sneakin in the crib
But her momma never caught us
What they taught us
Man them bad bitches only want the ballers
To start us, we hoopin
Now them hoes want to guard us
Uh, ok so play d, know what I mean
And I, I, I put ya on the team
And this life is but a dream
And I need a fast car, bad broads
Fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star
Ey where ya goin nigga
Shit, it ain't no tellin
They say this life is but a dream
Well I need a fast car, bad broads
Fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star
Ey where ya goin nigga
It ain't no tellin
