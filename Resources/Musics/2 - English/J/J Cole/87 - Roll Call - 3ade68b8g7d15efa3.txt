ROLL CALL

Just got off the phone with my nigga Smitty
Shit too real back home boi..
For real..

This for my nigga Sed, hold ya head
I know shit rough, but nigga we don't give up
We don't get mad, nigga, we just get tough
We just get right, nigga, we don't get left
Fuck what they said, cause what we learned coming up
You can't teach that shit. Life deal a nigga blows
But we eat that shit
This one here's for my brother, we gon beat that shit now
I say my prayers, I got too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail or they're dead right now
One time for my nigga Craig right now
He in the feds - damn, the times change
And these stupid niggas talking about "crime pays"
You can keep that shit: I just made a million
Call me when you reached that shit

Ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And the young boy from a show down in Hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Ain't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep, I suppose..
But after a year of review, I figured out it wasn't me, it was you
Congratulations..
