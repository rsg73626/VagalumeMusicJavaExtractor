FOLGERS CRYSTALS

Yeah, yeah
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Revenge)

Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat turner in my past life
Bob marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
who survive against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago
The game snatch a nigga's spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
'Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
first thing they do is throw their shade
Word, err
I swerve like a thunderbird on a curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scripture
Known to rip a hole through
them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the dreamers, so vindictive
Been back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you nigga sleeping this is folgers crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "hello"
just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil you can tell him
cole just sent you now

Yeah, yeah
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah
Higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trusting a nigga, you can count on me
I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trusting a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me

Revenge
