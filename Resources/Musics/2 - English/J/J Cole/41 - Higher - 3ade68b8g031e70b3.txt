HIGHER

[Hook]
Come here I'm about to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire

Come here I'm about to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but hey?

[Verse 1]
Uh, what up girl, tell me how you feelin'
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in
She said looks kill and I'm tryin to make a killin'
And God willing, I'd be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain't dealin' with no broke nigga
Down in Miami, with a super ho team
Tryin' to bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin' All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin' like James, somethin like Wade
If you something like paid you can fuck tonight
Yeah she said fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings, won't spend her life slavin'
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money man the head is amazing

[Hook]
Come here I'm about to take you higher

Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire

[Verse 2]
What up girl, tell me how you been

Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, god damn
Hey now got a thing for you
Its been a long time comin, I should hang with you
Cause see way back
I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy's now, 2 and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah you still got it though
Girl your body lookin' like a fuckin' pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your head did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll
Do you get brains, did you make the honor roll

[Verse 3]
Hey, I get bored so fast that they won't last
But girl you're special like I met you in the slow class
Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star
Like Halle Berry, your old nigga act like a bitch
like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your Espn
If your mind is on sex you must got Esp then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn't Vip then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that
I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie, well show me what kind of friend you is
Well if its phony your only cause I can get you ins
Too late for turning back, fuck it we continuing
Get your ass in that position, I love to bend you in
