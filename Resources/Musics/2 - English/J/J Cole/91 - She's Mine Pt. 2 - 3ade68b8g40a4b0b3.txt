SHE'S MINE PT. 2

Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love
For the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit
On this bus I sit

Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin' me, wantin' me
Givin' me a chance
To feel special to somebody
In a world where they not lovin' me

[verse 1]
Handcuffs keep huggin the
Wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand
To make the evil dissapear
That means that there
Would be no santa claus no more
To bring you christmas cheer
'cause what he represents
Is really greed and the need
To purchase shit
From corporations that make a killin'
Because they feed on the wallets of the poor
Who be knockin' on they door
Every black friday
Just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount
Write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit
It don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love
We just likin' shit here
What's that smell
Where's your diaper shit here
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing
Thats right in my whole life
Got me thinking

Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift
Into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift
Into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift?

[verse 2]
People ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act
Like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what god made
Fuck this album shit
Hey mama look what god made
She's mine
Catch me
Don't you, catch me
Don't you, catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, cause now your here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin' baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

There is a god
It is a god
Yeah, it is a god
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
I've fallen in love
For the first time
