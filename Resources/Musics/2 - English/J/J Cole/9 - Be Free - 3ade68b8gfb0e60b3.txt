BE FREE

And now I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I'd be on the go
It ain't no drink out there that could kill my soul
Ho, no
All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free

Can you tell me why every time I step outside
I see my niggas down
Oh, I'm letting you know
That it ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh, no

All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free

Are we all alone fighting on our own
Please give me a chance
I don't wanna dance
Some things got me down
I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around
Don't just stand around

All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free

All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free
