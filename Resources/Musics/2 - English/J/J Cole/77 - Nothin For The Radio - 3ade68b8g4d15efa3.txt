NOTHIN FOR THE RADIO

The ghetto is pitch black and we all wanna shine, so a third of us round
The other half about math, flipping birds, reading a …there is no words to describe
My habitat accepts hostiles, …, and trips to the hospital or …
Get locked in solitude surrounded by darkness hoping some light shine … through
… dvd boosting, crack rock producing, business suits claim we’re useless
And won’t give you jobs, and wonder why their ass get robbed
Wonder why my junk brother stuck on reefer
Because the state refuse to pay good teachers
While the rich kids watch from the bleaches
I ask jesus let some light creep in

May god keep a little something for the g’s and cold hearted niggers that’s freezin’
Everything happens for a reason
Why nigger’s start shit, this ain’t nothin for the radio, nah this ain’t nothing for the radio
Nah, this right here what you’ve been waiting for, hey this right here what you’ve been waiting for

Why is it me that this dark cloud follows?
I …ground in this velvet here bottles
I keep my hand from him it’s a revival
The limits keep my hands spinning like a gyro
I need a cairo, … cause I feel like I’m alone in this world
Who got my back? they tell me find god like I don’t know where he at
And if he lost I be following him
Just acknowledge the fact that a father exists, and the devil’s alive
I’m just caught in the mix, be fore he shines his light over me I was out on the strip
Holding it down till I discovered my gift, got talent bro, I’m telling you
It felt more like a curse, in my hoodie, I still made it to church
Just the time they hear the pastor complain like sunshine after the rain, help us out

May god keep a little something for the g’s and cold hearted niggers that’s freezin’
Everything happens for a reason
Why nigger’s start shit, this ain’t nothin for the radio, nah this ain’t nothing for the radio
Nah, this right here what you’ve been waiting for, hey this right here what you’ve been waiting for.
