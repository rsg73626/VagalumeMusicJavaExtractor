2FACE

Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And im all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I thinked about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villians?
Knowing they killin’
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then the hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of wait on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Mate this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
Im playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

[Outro]
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey
