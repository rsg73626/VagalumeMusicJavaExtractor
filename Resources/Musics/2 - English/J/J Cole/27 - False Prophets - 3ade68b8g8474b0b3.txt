FALSE PROPHETS

Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this

[verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away
Due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half-ass shit he dropped
We always buy it
When he tell us he a genius
But it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him
To look into the mirror lately
There was a time
When this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall
From grace is hard to take
'cause I believed him when he said his shit
Was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real
But all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders
You know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say
Somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along
It's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizing niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out
These niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up
Then they bite the shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important
Is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on
I'm beggin' him to stop
And playin' his old shit
Knowin' he won't top it, false prophets

Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this
False prophets
(la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la...)
Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper
And he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim
The respect that's been had
By all the legends
So every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him
The shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter
He can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga
You too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life
But you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics
Who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart
Don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate
The need to be great
Turns into an obsession
And keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words
Hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly
But intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music
Or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?

[verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand
That they ain't even sure
'bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category
As a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments
Come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas
That couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' bout opinions
I wanna give hope
Like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss
Make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones
Who listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real god is in you
Not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit
And I know I can top it; false prophets

Somebody shoulda told me
It would be like this
Be like this, be like this
