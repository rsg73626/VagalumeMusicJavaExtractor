LOUIS VUITTON

Got a young chick from the hood, south side
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit
She was up against
Little did he know the shit
Was going to back fire
'cause she act quiet, got baptized
Sang in the choir
But the thing she desired was a
Older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl is in heat, it's deep
She sneaking out, off the leash
On the streets at night
When the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back
That she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out
She living on her own and it's vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And I'm thinking of the best way
To kick her out

'cause all she ever talks about
Is louie, louie
All she ever talks about is louis vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more
I mean louie, louie
All she ever talk about is louie, louie
All she ever talk about is louie vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more

I told the bitch somebody stole my rollie
She talking 'bout "me too
I came through with a brand new louis bag
She talking 'bout "me too
La on my next flight
You guess right, she said me too
Now everybody gonna ms. me too
Goddamn, be you
And if that is you, you so shallow
You on a boat that won't travel
Won't float and won't paddle
If I go broke it won't matter
This stupid ass shit don't make me
I been poor, won't break me
You so caught up on material shit
We both know that you can't even get

I mean my window down
Let me roll my windows up
My plink went down
I just got my little cup
My freaks go down
Nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Ayo, ayo

Dude got a rich bitch, though
She off the chain, ready to go
Baddest thing, head to toe
Fine line between a rock star and just a ho
But she walked that
Goddamn, girl, she walked that
Big money talk real loud
I mean I can barely talk back
But I, but I got good game, good game
Nothing like them lames you used to
I know the rules gon' use you
I just want the same shit that you do
Can you keep a secret?
Sometimes, man, your beeper leak it
Nigga told me she evil
I danced with the devil then
Please believe it
Please believe it

She take my hip-hop, ayo
She don't want to fuck with me
Am I big snob? ayo
She might not fuck with me
Am I a big splotch? ayo
She don't want to fuck with me no more
