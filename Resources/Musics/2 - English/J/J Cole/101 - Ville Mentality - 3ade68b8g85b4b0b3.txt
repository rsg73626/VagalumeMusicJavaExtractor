VILLE MENTALITY

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

[verse 1]
Trials and tribulations
I'm facing in this age of information
I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone
When they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone
When they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that it faces

[interlude]
My dad, he died-he got shot
Cause his friend set him up
And I didn't go to his funeral
And sometimes when I'm in my room
I get mad at my momma when she mean to me
And she
And she say, clean up-I say

[verse 2]
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never

I get mad, I slam my door and go in my room
And then, I get mad and I say
"I wish my dad was here"
