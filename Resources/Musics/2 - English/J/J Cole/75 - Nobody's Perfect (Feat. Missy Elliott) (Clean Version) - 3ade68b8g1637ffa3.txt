NOBODY'S PERFECT (FEAT. MISSY ELLIOTT) (CLEAN VERSION)

This is for all the fans that waited, the * * that hated
Old * we dated, look mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes
Smokin' * on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' about girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls and vandalizin' her curls
Sweating her weave out, moans as she breathes out
* I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute

I step over piranhas, death over dishonor
They killin * for J's, that's death over designer
Hey Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dawana
Now a * only textin' distress over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood * in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue about the same thing
Tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing?

(Missy Elliott)
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect eh
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect eh
But you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go * and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, name

Oh yeah, to my college girl, 
Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby with your roommates, 
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little * but her * together
Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose
Only * with * who got * to lose
Yeah, I heard stories about different dudes
Her man on campus but it's fine by me
Say she only * like 4-5 *, 
So you know you gotta multiply by 3

Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect eh
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect eh
But you're perfect for me
'We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go * and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, name
