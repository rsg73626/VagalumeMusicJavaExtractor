NEVER TOLD

Uh, Angel eyes, long hair, I see you cryin', what's wrong there
"He did what? He fucked who?", we know the story, what's new?
See I could probably rush you, tell you that he should have loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna to score, you gotta wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the
Door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode, why we cheat? I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heaven's no, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know
That he cheated, and somehow I never told
I never told

"Hey, you wanna be a man?
Yeah I wanna be a man.
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.
I ain't gonna tell.
Alright then man. You're a man now.
Okay."

Ok, that's what it is, I see the game
The hoes come, the season's change
The hoes go, we rearrange
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The old G's that beat the game, forever young, Peter Pan
35, still playin', child support, still payin'

Jugglin', bill payin', been runnin' round, field dayin'
Wine and dine, meal payin', with hopes that she'll land
The bed and, get wet then, give head then

You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man

One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids, or Reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts
There go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

"You know what? I need to talk to you.
About what?
I don't think this is, working out for us.
Why?
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, 
I just wanna find myself, that's all.
What the fuck?! "
