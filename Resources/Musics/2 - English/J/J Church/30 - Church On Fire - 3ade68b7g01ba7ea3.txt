CHURCH ON FIRE

I’d recognize that song anywhere,
Equal parts of hope and despair,
You can't believe,
But it's history,
You can't decide,
You can't pick sides, no

He's been drinking all day,
He drinks it away,
I guess it's okay, it’s okay,
He's drinking today,
He can't get away,
But he and his friends,
They laugh anyway

And with one good walk around,
I feel like I know this whole town,
And I'm feeling down

It was worse than he had ever seen,
The fire was higher than the highest trees,
Up went the church,
Up went the steeple,
Cars passing through, dozens of people

I stared for a minute or two,
But there was nothing that I could do,
But stare at the sight,
Eleven at night,
A walk through the fog,
I guess I'm all right, right

And with one good walk around,
I feel like I know this whole town,
And I'm feeling down
