AYN RAND IS DEAD

Ayn Rand is dead,
So put down your pen,
A whole new generation,
Who pointlessly defend,
Ayn Rand is dead,
And I can not pretend,
To embrace a greed,
Of unnatural stipend

An individual's individual,
So scared that you've turned cynical,
An individual's individual,
So scared that you've turned cynical,
You've turned cynical

Ayn Rand is dead,
But she walks again,
'Til every river dies polluted,
She is the undead,
Ayn Rand is dead,
But she wants revenge,
History will march and die,
Just like her in the end

An individual's individual,
So scared that you've turned cynical,
An individual's individual,
So scared that you've turned cynical,
You've turned cynical

Ayn Rand is dead,
Ayn Rand is dead,
Ayn Rand is dead,
Ayn Rand is dead
