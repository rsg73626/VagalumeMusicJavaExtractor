I'VE GOT A CRAZY FEELING

I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got a crazy feeling,
I need more time in Auckland, New Zealand,
Does he know he's just Eno?
Every wall has paint that's peeling,
It's so late to be getting rain,
My mind was already on the plane,
Everyone at Flying Nun helped me keep it a little more sane,

I love, I love, I love, I love my red jacket,
It's usefulness is one of many facets,
Driving around in a woman's car,
She must work in A & R,
I've got a crazy feeling,
I need more time in Auckland, New Zealand,
My mind is rockin' and a-reelin',
I need more time in Auckland, New Zealand
