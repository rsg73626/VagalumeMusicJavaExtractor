TIGHTROPE

They say some days you're gonna win,
They say some days you're gonna lose,
I tell you I got news for you,
You're losin' all the time, you never win, no

If you believe that's how it's gonna be I'd better put you down,
[...?] is always gonna be the same,
You gotta save me now,
You'd better turn around

(Hey)
And I looked around (looked around),
I was heading down,
Won't somebody throw me down a line?

They say some days you gotta give,
They say some days you gotta take,
If that's the way it's gonna be,
Roll it over and you will see

The city streets are full of people going nowhere wasting time,
The things that make today are passing [... the train],
[On] the line,
Can't you see the sign?

(Hey)
When I looked around (looked around),
I was heading down,
Won't somebody throw me down a line?

I wouldn't look you straight in the eye,
I wanna tell you how I feel,
I can feel the music turnin' around,
Won't somebody come down the line?

The city streets are full of people going nowhere wasting time,
The things that make today are passing [... the train],
[On] the line,
Can't you see the sign?

(Hey),
And I closed my eyes (closed my eyes),
I was so surprised,
Somebody had thrown me down a line,
Somebody had thrown me down a line
