GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma,
I know, I know it’s serious,
Girlfriend in a coma,
I know, I know it’s serious

There were times when I wish I’d strangled her,
But you know that I would hate anything to happen to her,
No I don’t want to see her

Do you really think she’ll pull through?
Do you really think she’ll pull through?
No

Girlfriend in a coma,
I know, I know it’s serious,
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye baby, goodbye

There were times when I wish I’d murdered her,
But you know that I would hate anything to happen to her,
Would you please let me see her

Do you really think she’ll pull through?
Do you really think she’ll pull through?
No

Let me whisper my last goodbyes,
I know it’s serious
