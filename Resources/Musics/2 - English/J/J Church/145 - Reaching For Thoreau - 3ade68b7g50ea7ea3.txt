REACHING FOR THOREAU

When I think about my useless limbs,
I see a sad defeated army,
A million cells, some MIA,
Are we waiting for our Midway?
The reptile mind runs parallel,
To the bird mind runs parallel,
In the lion mind runs parallel,
In my mind

I'm not looking for the naked truth,
I've got just enough proof,
I'm trying to find creative ways,
To keep my head out of the noose

'Cause everybody knows there's no hope in loneliness,
And in loneliness there is no hope at all,
Everybody knows where grass is gonna grow,
But grass has got no reason, none at all

Every night when I go to bed,
I remember every word I said,
But every word is all alone,
And none of them define the whole,
My mind runs parallax,
I'm dying on the railway tracks,
I'm reaching for Thoreau,
My mind is here trying to go

I'm not looking for the naked truth,
I've got just enough proof,
I'm trying to find creative ways,
To keep my head out of the noose

'Cause everybody knows there's no hope in loneliness,
And in loneliness there is no hope at all,
Everybody knows where grass is gonna grow,
But grass has got no reason, none at all

In the event that something should happen to me,
Burn all my possessions thoroughly

I'm not looking for the naked truth,
I've got just enough proof,
I'm trying to find creative ways,
To keep my head out of the noose

'Cause everybody knows there's no hope in loneliness,
And in loneliness there is no hope at all,
Everybody knows where grass is gonna grow,
But grass has got no reason, none at all
