NAMES AND PLACES AND THESIS

From the beginning,
My understanding,
I am dying and I was born that way

Names and places and thesis,
It's all a bit too late,
Names and places and thesis,
The bloodlines dissipate

My caption,
My reaction,
Nothing you could ever appreciate

Names and places and thesis,
It's all a bit too late,
Names and places and thesis,
The bloodlines dissipate

Names and places and thesis,
It's all a bit too late,
Names and places and thesis,
The bloodlines dissipate
