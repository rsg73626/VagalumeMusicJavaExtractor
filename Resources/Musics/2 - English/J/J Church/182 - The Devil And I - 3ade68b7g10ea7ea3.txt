THE DEVIL AND I

I will get you back if it's the last thing that I do,
I'm taking classes every night for my revenge on you,
I may get a gun. I'm still not sure what I will do,
But rest assured that you will know what I am going through

What's another sleepless night?
What am I supposed to do?
Can water change to wine?
I can drink myself to sleep,
And hopefully forget to breathe,
I hate what I've done to my life

You wear out your jaw. You're so austere in your belief,
Each day you work a heart between your pretty yellow teeth,
I'm succinct about this feeling but confused about remorse,
For I loved you like a choir of worms progressing to a corpse

What's another sleepless night?
What am I supposed to do?
Can water change to wine?
I can drink myself to sleep,
And hopefully forget to breathe,
I hate what I've done to my life

Christmas night the Devil and I had a little chat,
He asked me would I rather die as a dog or as a rat,
You can please the universe by using any means,
But when you are alone, I hope you think of me

What's another sleepless night?
What am I supposed to do?
Can water change to wine?
I can drink myself to sleep,
And hopefully forget to breathe,
I hate what I've done to my life
