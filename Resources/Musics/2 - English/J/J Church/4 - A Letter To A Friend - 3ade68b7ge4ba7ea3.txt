A LETTER TO A FRIEND

I want you to know as you lie in that bed,
That I miss you more than any word that I’ve said,
And it meant more to me to touch your forehead,
Than all the talking

I was feeling useless so I had to write it down,
You dreamt of the fields back in my old home town,
I’ll put you on my back and you won’t touch the ground,
You can leave the wheelchair behind

We can go to Silver Lake,
We can get drunk on the plans we made,
Away from the vipers and their yellow cake,
Away from Hollywood and Western

Maybe we don’t need to be so patient,
I’ll quit my job if you quit your medication,
Take the next bus leaving L.A. station,
Your father’s heroes are gone
