DORA AND LILI

Idle hands for the idle rich,
The men think she's a bitch,
She's a twin to one belief,
For now she is a thief,
She smiles and laughs and you want more,
But she thinks you're a bore,
Hungary is where Hungarians live,
A country Shakespeare invented

The stars speak to everyone,
They look down on Earth,
They're a vocal audience (a vocal audience),
Making sweet collages for a sad and lonely dog,
Who only now believes the truth,
Who believes the truth,
Who believes the truth,
Who believes the truth

She knows just where the bomb must go,
She drops Kropotkin in the snow,
Her birds fly off in instinct,
Some things don't need thinking,
Men all speak like seminars,
Dialog impossible,
The stars now sing for Lili,
And bring out her twin sister

The stars speak to everyone,
As they look down on Earth,
They're a vocal audience (a vocal audience),
Making sweet collages for a sad and lonely dog,
Who only now believes the truth,
Who believes the truth,
Who believes the truth,
Who believes the truth,
Who believes the truth
