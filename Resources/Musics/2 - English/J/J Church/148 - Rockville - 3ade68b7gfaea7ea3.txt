ROCKVILLE

Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus,
Going to a place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough,
Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't know,
You'll wind up in some factory, spend all your time, there's and nowhere left to go,
Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself,
I know it might sound strange, but I believe you'll be coming back here before too long

Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
Don't go back to Rockville (I know it's time to go),
Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
And waste another year

At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend,
It doesn't matter if you're not here with me,
'Cause it's so much easier to handle all my problems when I'm too far gone to see,
But something better happen soon,
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
Don't go back to Rockville (I know it's time to go),
Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
And waste another year

It's not as though I really need you,
If you were here I'd only bleed you,
It's just that everybody in this town only wants to put you down,
And that's not how it ought to be,
I know it might sound strange, but I believe you'll be coming back here before too long

Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
Don't go back to Rockville (I know it's time to go),
Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
And waste another year

Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
Don't go back to Rockville (I know it's time to go),
Don't go back to Rockville (how I wish I could stay),
And waste another year
