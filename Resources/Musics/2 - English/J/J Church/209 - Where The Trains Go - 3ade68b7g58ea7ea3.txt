WHERE THE TRAINS GO

I've never seen fireflies,
It doesn't affect most of my life,
The rings of Saturn might as well be lies,
Take off your coat and stay a while,
Caffeine and sugar to analyze,
We can talk 'til sunrise,
Sunrise, above all else,
Comes as no surprise

And I don't know where the trains go,
Should I just assume "away" is good enough a reason?
What do you know, San Francisco?
Maybe I'm just looking for a non-existent feeling

I can't stand the quiet night,
The sweetly humming electrical wires,
Static electricity, static lullabies,
The radio whispers my desire,
A poignant, washed-out attitude,
It's sincere and absolute,
It's finished here,
Go to bed dear

And I don't know where the trains go,
Should I just assume "away" is good enough a reason?
What do you know, San Francisco?
Maybe I'm just looking for a non-existent feeling
