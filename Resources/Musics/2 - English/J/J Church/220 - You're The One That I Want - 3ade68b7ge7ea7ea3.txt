YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT

I got chills, they're multiplying,
And I'm losing control,
For the power you're supplying,
It's electrifying!

You better shape up, 'cause I need a man,
And my heart is set on you, (And my heart is set on you),
You better shape up, you better understand,
To my heart I must be true,
And there's nothing,
And there's nothing for me to do

You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
The one I need, oh yes indeed

If you're filled with affection,
You're too shy to convey,
Meditate in my direction,
Feel your way

I better shape up, don't treat me this way,
Who can keep me satisfied,
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove (you better prove),
That my faith is justified,
Are you sure?
Yes I'm sure down deep inside

You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
The one I need, oh yes indeed

You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want),
Ho, ho, ho, honey,
The one I need, oh yes indeed
