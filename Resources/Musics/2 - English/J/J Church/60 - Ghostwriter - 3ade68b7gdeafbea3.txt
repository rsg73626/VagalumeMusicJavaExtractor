GHOSTWRITER

Does anyone ever get their due?
I don’t think it will take much from you,
To find out that it’s scarcely true,
If you take the time to watch Shampoo,
Keep in mind the years of solitude,
Some angry men put her through

She didn’t have to prove anything,
Still she took one for the team,
Now we can say how it changed everything

Taking her cue from people she knew,
Ida Lupino and Eisenstein to name a few,
She is searching for the truth,
She’s a ghostwriter - Hollywood outsider,
Ghostwriter at the typewriter,
Ghostwriter - everything inside her

She didn’t have to prove anything,
Still she took one for the team,
Now we can say how it changed everything

She didn’t have to prove anything,
Still she took one for the team,
Now we can say how it changed everything,
Everything
