HARVEST

And I thought I had it right,
And I thought it was so black and white,
But when the chips are down,
And my friend lay bleeding on the ground,
A different answer was in my sight

I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
What do I know?

And I thought that I'd know what to do,
I thought my answers all were true,
But when they raped my friend,
And I couldn't see an end,
I found I had another clue

I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
What do I know?

When your back's against the wall,
And my job is to recall,
Sometimes the end is to fight the means

And I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
I thought that it would make more of a difference to me,
What do I know?
