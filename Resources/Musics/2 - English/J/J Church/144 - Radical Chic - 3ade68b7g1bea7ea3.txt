RADICAL CHIC

Radical chic, it's your mystique,
Your so-called movement will be dead in a week,
Lesbian chic, Thelma And Louise,
It's all so simple on the big screen

I want to believe,
As much as you want to believe,
We'd like our reality in bite-sized pieces

Radical chic, Madonna's knees,
Her Coke bottle trick is an old disease,
Radical chic, the magazine,
Same old lie sold to you by me

I want to believe,
As much as you want to believe,
We go out of our way to make our lives easy

Nothing is free in society,
You buy revolutions out of condom machines,
Looking for leaders, looking for keys,
'Cause if you read it in the paper it's a fantasy

I want to believe,
As much as you want to believe,
We go out of our way to make our lives easy
