TO THE MOON

I've got customs, nothing functions,
Tongues and different hues,
I've got sizes, slices eyes,
That know you're nothing new,
I've never wanted to go to the moon,
Or grow too old too soon,
Now you're talking like it's something special to do

I've seen trees,
Been weak in the knees,
And walked in ancient lands,
I've shared rice in a social device,
But it's never been part of my plan,
I've never wanted to go to the moon,
Or grow too old too soon,
But now you're talking like it's something special to do
