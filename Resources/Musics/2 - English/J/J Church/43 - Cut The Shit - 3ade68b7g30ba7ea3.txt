CUT THE SHIT

Cut the shit. You know it's just a part of life,
Fuck that shit. It was your choice to sacrifice,
Don't do it because you can

You are innocent in criminal times,
But you're not into it. Why do you even try?
Go do it while you can

I can see the hypocrisies,
Words are coming back to haunt me

Leaving her so quickly always felt like a mistake,
She didn't yell. She didn't cry. This is all she said:
"You'll regret this some day"

Paranoid of anything pinning you down,
Well now your only solace comes from streets in this town,
And the sadness of all that surrounds

I can read the hypocrisies,
Words are coming back to haunt me

I can read the hypocrisies,
Words are coming back to haunt me
