SOUND GUY SMILEY

He's going to say what little he has to say,
He's going to say it in the longest possible way,
He knows what he's doing,
You are wrong, he is right,
He will remind you all throughout the night

This is his club,
This is his kingdom,
Does he realize he's in Richmond, Virginia,
This is a problem that cannot be fixed,
Tonight I'm taking you out of the mix

It's too late at night to start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right,
It's too late at night to start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right

Nothing's gonna be all right,
Nothing's gonna be all right

He's going to say what little he has to say,
He's going to say it in the longest possible way,
He knows what he's doing,
You are wrong, he is right,
He will remind you all throughout the night

This is his club,
This is his kingdom,
Does he realize he's in Richmond, Virginia,
This is a problem that cannot be fixed,
Tonight I'm taking you out of the mix

I'm too tired to deal with this,
I can't believe that it's come to this,
Everything is shit,
Everything is shit,
So here I am in the middle of it

I'm sick,
I'm sick of all the waste,
I'm dying to get out of this place,
I wanna be at home,
I wanna be alone,
I don't wanna talk to the man with the microphone

It's too late at night to start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right,
It's too late at night to start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right

Nothing's gonna be all right,
Nothing's gonna be all right
