YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL

The trip to Washington was just a test,
Now there's a feeling of uneasiness,
How did you manage such a tangled mess?
You feel like a fool

You've taken all there is to find,
He's under your skin all the time,
But all's the same in his mind,
You feel like a fool

You left your diary out on the bed,
Did you expect that it wouldn't be read?
He finally hears you saying that love is dead,
You feel like a fool

She took all there was to take,
You thought everything was going great,
You thought wrong, such a big mistake,
You feel like a fool
