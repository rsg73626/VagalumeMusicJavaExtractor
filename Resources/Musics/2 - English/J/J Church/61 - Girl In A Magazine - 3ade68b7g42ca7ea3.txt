GIRL IN A MAGAZINE

Girl that's in a magazine,
Do you know what you're doing?
You told me that you were free,
Do you know what you're doing?
This is not a jealous song,
Do you know what you're doing?
But how long can you prolong?

You told me that you were free,
You couldn't be held by their chains,
Isn't it funny how things change,
You told me it was all routine and that you could walk away,
Can you say that today?

Girl that's in a magazine,
Do you know what you're doing?
You told me that you were free,
Do you know what you're doing?
This is not a jealous song,
Do you know what you're doing?
But how long can you prolong?

She looks at you from page 102,
She's got vacant lifeless eyes, they tell no lies,
She goes to the closet and gets the gun,
The only act with honesty,
And that's the part you'll never see

Girl that's in a magazine,
Do you know what you're doing?
You told me that you were free,
Do you know what you're doing?
This is not a jealous song,
Do you know what you're doing?
But how long can you prolong?
