SAM RIVERS

Chitty, chitty chat, chitty chat,
Surrounded by the sycophants,
But he's a cool, cool cat,
He is 79 years old,
He's heard it all before,
He'll hear it all some more,
This is your chance,
It's your once chance,
Will you just ask for an autograph?
Can you find a single word that he hasn't heard,
Though it's not what he demands?

A personal experience,
You cannot explain,
At the Ceremony Hall,
Everything just changed,
And you can't possibly understand

If you listen with your eyes you'll be mystified by the superficial signs,
If you listen with your ears there is an outside chance that you will hear,
If everything goes as planned,
As it always can with an improvising man,
Tonight you will see the light,
I know it sounds trite,
But it is alright

A personal experience,
You cannot explain,
At the Ceremony Hall,
Everything just changed,
And you can't possibly understand

Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light,
Tonight you will see the light
