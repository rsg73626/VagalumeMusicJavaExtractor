AS I LIE

As I lie here crushed beneath the wheels of a MUNI bus,
The commuters all around me crane their necks to see,
By the looks on their faces I must be a disgrace,
I can see my bike down the block/

I can see my bike,
It's down the block,
I can see my bike,
It's down the block

As I lie here beneath the wheel it's so surreal,
I can feel the cool Market Street breezes,
I can't feel nothing, I guess it's sobering,
I've never seen this part of Market Street

I've never seen this part of Market Street,
I've never seen this part of Market Street

As I lie here close to death, it's getting serious,
I kinda wish I'd kept that data entry job,
I feel wide awake although things are turning gray,
It's the side effect of dying on Muddy Waters coffee

It's the side effect of dying on Muddy Waters coffee,
It's the side effect of dying on Muddy Waters coffee
