THE OVERWHELMING SMELL

He's got a million lines for each of your ears,
He's telling you exactly what you want to hear,
He's telling you what you want to hear,
His hands are sweaty moving

You have a beer, another beer,
Another and another and another beer,
Now you're ready to take him on,
Now you are prepared

Punching walls, punching doors,
Nothing like this ever happened to him before,
Picks his pants up off the floor,
Seen it all before

He will use her for tonight,
She is the one I wish I’d treated right

He walks away,
Your evening saved,
Except the overwhelming smell of his aftershave,
It'll be gone in another day,
And thank God for that

The overwhelming smell of his aftershave,
It'll be gone in another day,
Your apartment stinks like aftershave,
"It's a long story. I'll tell you another day"

He will use her for tonight,
She is the one I wish I’d treated right
