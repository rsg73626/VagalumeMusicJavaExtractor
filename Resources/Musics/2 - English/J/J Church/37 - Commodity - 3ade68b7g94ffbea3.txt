COMMODITY

Everything in life becomes commodity,
Close your eyes and look to the east,
Capital is our only reality,
A cancer growing in the belly of the beast

Intentions, no matter what they be,
Only act as oil in the machine,
Only help to increase productivity,
Misery is the only life we've seen

'Cause you see they still have a conscience,
The proof exists beyond the wall,
I am here to prove that existence,
Should it be an issue at all?
I am here to prove that existence,
Should it be an issue at all?

Society in all is just a marketplace,
Relationships are based on commodity,
No revolution, no cause, no god, no state,
Prison guards are made up of daily banalities

'Cos you see they still have a conscience,
The proof could be beyond the wall,
I am here to prove that existence,
Should it be an issue at all?
I am here to prove that existence,
Should it be an issue at all?
