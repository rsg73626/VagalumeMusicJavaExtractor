IF WE WAIT

There's some food upon the table, boys,
And if you should ever see me crying,
Then you'd know that I am weak,
And you are free to take me downstairs,
Away from cares

I'll be with you in the morning, boys,
'Cause you know that if we wait for our time,
We'll all be dead

So now I've bored you, crying my life away,
Don't I know it, always the things I say,
Always the things,
If you could be anything that you wanna be,
Do you think you would be who you see in the mirror?
If I look long enough my face will start to change,
If I look close enough I'll take away the pain,
Oh I don't care any more,
Any more, any more, any more

I'll be with you in the morning, boys,
'Cause you know that if we wait for our time,
We'll all be dead
