YOUNG MOTHER

She woke up on a summer morning,
She woke up like any other morning,
But she knows today is different,
Something is growing inside her

She's gonna have a baby,
Do you think it's a good idea?
I know no-one can stop her,
But do you think it's a good idea?
She's gonna have a baby,
Do you think it's a good idea?
I know no-one can stop her,
But do you think it's a good idea?

She is going to be a young mother,
Obligation to no other,
She may ruin her life and another,
But decisions have been made

Do you have your mother's eyes?
Do you have your child's eyes?

She's gonna have a baby,
Do you think it's a good idea?
I know no-one can stop her,
But do you think it's a good idea?
She's gonna have a baby,
Do you think it's a good idea?
I know no-one can stop her,
But do you think it's a good idea?
