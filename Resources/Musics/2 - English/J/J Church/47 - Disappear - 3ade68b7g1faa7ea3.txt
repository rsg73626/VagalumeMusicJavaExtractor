DISAPPEAR

No, I didn’t want to hear it,
But the words came from her mouth so slowly,
I saw her face change,
She wanted none of that sympathy,
You can say what you will,
But I know she has suffered enough,
And I don’t know victims,
Only survivors surviving your touch

I thought I knew all the answers,
But the words they disappeared,
I can’t imagine, I can’t even try,
The vision in my mind was never clear

The fear of touch,
It can lock you away for ever and ever,
Could it mean so much?
Every second we spent together,
I’d like to apologize,
For all the times your hurt was more than I could bear,
I try to empathise,
If I don’t understand at least I care

I thought I knew all the answers,
But the words they disappeared,
I can’t imagine, I can’t even try,
The vision in my mind was never clear

I thought I knew all the answers,
But the words they disappeared,
I can’t imagine, I can’t even try,
The vision in my mind was never clear
