TERROR OR LOVE

Romance may be a bankrupt term while we watch the city burn,
I have to wonder if it’s true and I’m so glad I’m here with you,
Planting bombs - robbing banks, call it war, call it pranks,
Call it terror, call it love, watch our numbers rise above

I’m so glad I’m here with you,
We believe in something new,
I’m so glad I’m here with you,
We believe in something new

Romance may be a dated term we love to watch the city burn,
While we make our escape hand in hand - hand in fate,
Living in the underground, now we move from town to town,
Call it terror, call it love, watch our flags rise above

I’m so glad I’m here with you,
We believe in something new,
I’m so glad I’m here with you,
We believe in something new

I’m so glad I’m here with you,
We believe in something new,
I’m so glad I’m here with you,
We believe in something new
