BOTTOM RUNG

Me, I’m part of the machine,
The bottom rung of the company,
The only time I start to worry,
Is when the machine becomes part of me

Me and my self esteem...,
I’d like to go back to sleep,
But even my dreams these days,
Have work related scenes

Friday night I went out for a drink,
Saturday and Sunday I was free,
Free to sleep, 
Free to read,
Freedom from security

They take away my whole day,
They’re taking my soul away,
Taking my heart and soul,
For products useless anyway

Me, when I was younger I thought I was free,
How much wronger could I be?
The company will grind on careless, 
With or without me

Friday night I went out for a drink,
Saturday and Sunday I was free,
Free to read,
Free to drink,
Freedom from security
