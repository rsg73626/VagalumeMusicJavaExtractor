IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE

You should have known when you met him at the party,
He was the kind of guy that would have an extra copy,
Of 'The Hundredth Monkey' sitting so prominently,
On his bookshelf made of milkcrates,
Made of milkcrates, made of milkcrates

You should have known,
You should have known,
You tell yourself you should have known,
He'd be burning incense, talking all his nonsense,
You should have known that a sensitive guy,
Lives a lie, you can't look him in the eye

You should have known,
You should have known, known, known, known, known,
You should have known

You should have known when you met her at the rally,
She would be the first one to mention,
The ivy league college she's attending this Fall,
She don't need you at all,
Just Daddy's money, that is all, that's all

You should have known,
You tell yourself that despite what she seems,
She sure has middle class dreams,
You should have known that a sensitive guy,
Lives a lie, you can't look him in the eye

You should have known,
You should have known, known, known, known, known,
You should have known

He's got a t-shirt and it says 'lick bush',
She's got a haircut like Sinead O'Connor and Manson,
He's got a t-shirt and it says 'lick bush',
She's got a haircut like Sinead O'Connor and Charles Manson

You should have known,
You should have known, known, known, known, known,
You should have known

Na na na na na,
It says 'lick bush',
Na na na na na,
Just like Sinead and Manson had,
Na na na na na,
It says 'lick bush',
Na na na na na,
Like Sinead O'Connor and Charles Manson
