CIGARETTES KILL

She had an idea,
It got her the fear,
And she loved her mother very much,
One cigarette,
Well she knew she was dead,
The way dad walked out of the room

An ancient soul for a twelve year old,
She acted quick and decisive,
Before her mother came home she left this world alone,
She couldn’t live with the thought of them knowing

Dear mom I love you very much,
But I cannot face you after all I’ve done,
Mom, I wanted to make you proud,
But now I’m dead so I’ll be in the ground

She was worried she would be grounded for a year,
She was worried, she couldn’t live with the thought of her mother knowing

Dear mom I love you very much,
But I cannot face you after all I’ve done,
Mom, I wanted to make you proud,
But now I’m dead so I’ll be in the ground

And I know it’s a joke,
But these cigarettes kill,
And I know it’s a joke,
But these cigarettes kill, these cigarettes kill
