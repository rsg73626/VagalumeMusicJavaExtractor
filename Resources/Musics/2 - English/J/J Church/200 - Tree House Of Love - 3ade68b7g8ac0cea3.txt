TREE HOUSE OF LOVE

We used to stay up all night,
Watching movies ‘til light,
Sometimes picking a fight when I knew she was right
They’d be riding their bikes,
All my friends they are dykes
If it’s not something you like,
Then go find something you like

Tell me something,
Something good,
I’d be happy if I could

When I’m walking at night and I’m feeling alright,
I’m afraid of the light,
Try to keep out of sight,
You can talk on the phone,
Make a garden of stone,
You can call it your home,
But you’re always alone

Tell me something,
Something good,
I’d be happy if I could

Tell me something,
Something good,
I’d be happy if I could
