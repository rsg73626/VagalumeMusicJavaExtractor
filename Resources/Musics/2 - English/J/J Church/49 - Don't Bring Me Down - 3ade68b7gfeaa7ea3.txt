DON'T BRING ME DOWN

You got me runnin', goin' out of my mind,
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time,
Don't bring me down,
No, no, no, no, no,
I'll tell you once more before I get up and go,
Don't bring me down

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights,
One of these days you're gonna get it right,
Don't bring me down,
No, no, no, no, no,
I'll tell you once more before I get up and go,
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down,
Don't bring me down,
Don't bring me down,
Don't bring me down

What happened to the girl I used to know?
You lost your mind out somewhere down the road,
Don't bring me down,
No, no, no, no, no,
I'll tell you once more before I get up and go,
Don't bring me down

You got me runnin' like a snake in the grass,
One of these days you're gonna break your glass,
Don't bring me down,
No no no no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get up and go,
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down,
Don't bring me down,
Don't bring me down,
Don't bring me down

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights,
One of these days you're gonna get it right,
Don't bring me down,
No, no, no, no, no,
I'll tell you once more before I get up and go,
Don't bring me down
