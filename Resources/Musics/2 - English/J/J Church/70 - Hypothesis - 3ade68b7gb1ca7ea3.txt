HYPOTHESIS

You say you're going up to higher ground,
You say you're going up to higher ground,
To higher ground
I don't think your hypothesis is very sound,
I don't think your hypothesis is very sound,
Is very sound

You don't mind the nails in your hands,
I prefer the needles in my back,
In my back

If I could just make one suggestion,
Perhaps start with experimentation,
With experimentation
