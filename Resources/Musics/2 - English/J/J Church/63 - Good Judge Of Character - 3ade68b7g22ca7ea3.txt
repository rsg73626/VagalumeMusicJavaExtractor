GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER

She never leaves the neighborhood,
She's a good judge of character,
I see her once in a while when I go by the uptown,
She says "Take care baby, take care baby, take care baby",
And I say "Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?"

She's from Austin but lives in her car,
She asks me on a date I can't afford,
She's been to whore's hell but still manages to smile,
She says "Take care baby, take care baby, take care baby",
And I say "Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?"

She's from Austin but lives in her car,
She's from Austin, lots of money there,
She's been to whore's hell but still manages to smile,
She says "Take care baby, take care baby, take care baby",
And I say "Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Cold out here?"

"Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?
Doesn't it get cold out here?"
