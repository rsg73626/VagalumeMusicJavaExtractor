WHAT WILL I DO?

Now what should I do?
A shoebox full of photographs,
Sometimes I look and have to laugh,
Can’t bring myself to throw them in the trash

Now what should I do?
Drenched another handkerchief,
Look at yourself, you’re a wreck,
When will you get over it?

Now what should I do?
I call you on the phone,
Hope and pray to God that you’re not at home,
Don’t want to think that you’re all alone

Now what should I do?
The phone rings around 9 o’clock,
Hadn’t noticed that the lights were off,
Anticipation is not enough
