THE LEGEND OF RITA

Like I said before, "We speak in codes",
Underneath the Eastern snow,
We don't believe in Western modes,
Race around the Berlin roads,
Rita in your mind; she is deep inside,
The Roaming Hash Rebels always have somewhere to hide

Banks are full of money,
Free for us to take,
We contribute chocolate sweets to be given away,

Rita - I hope you meet her,
You should see her smiling in your face,
Rita - I hope you meet her,
You should see her with a loaded AK

When they say "No future",
She shouts out "Guess again!"
She's a good example of how the revolution ends,
Heading to the East,
You think you're in the West,
There's no point in choosing,
Which one you think is the best
