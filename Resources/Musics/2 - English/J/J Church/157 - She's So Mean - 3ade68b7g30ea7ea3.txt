SHE'S SO MEAN

She is the girl that creates her own world,
What makes you think that it's the right idea?
Her perfunctory glance still feels like random chance,
It's a plan to make her words seem more sincere

The TV's on,
So I won't get to sleep tonight,
Her come on,
It's not enough to feel alright,
If I were 21,
She would only be 13,
It's no fun,
Or at least it isn't fun for me

Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
The girl who cleared herself a space in my world,
Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
She's a razor made of chocolate and curls

She's in graduate film school at NYU,
But she's out west for the summer,
She's been to Paris and she thinks that makes her "so rad",
The accent she affects is just rubbish

I'm sunk in,
I've drunk myself past better judgement,
It's funny,
But I thought I was really feeling something,
Four long weeks,
Stranded in another country,
When she speaks,
I'm reminded I am nothing

Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
The girl who cleared herself a space in my world,
Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
She's a razor made of chocolate and curls

She has a boyfriend back east that I'll probably never meet,
He can't be happy with the situation,
If it makes you feel any better, I feel equally pathetic,
I wish I could resist the invitation

She's so mean,
And it means a lot to me,
She's real keen,
On keeping me where she wants me to be,
She's so mean,
And I'm so not anything,
The more I see,
Does not point to the contrary

Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
The girl who cleared herself a space in my world,
Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
She's a razor made of chocolate and curls

Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl,
I bring you diamonds and she asks me for pearls,
Oh oh oh oh oh,
She's my ex-friend girl
