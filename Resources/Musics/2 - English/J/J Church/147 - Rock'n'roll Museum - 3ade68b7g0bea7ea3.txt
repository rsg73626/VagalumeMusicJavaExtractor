ROCK'N'ROLL MUSEUM

There's no reason to feel down,
Just because the Rock'N'Roll museum is in your town,
there's no reason to feel down,
Just take a book of matches, burn it to the ground,
Our night has ended while others have begun,
We sleep on floors and we speak in tongues

A cupboard full of kittens in the back,
Turns into 11 angry cats,
They don't appreciate the way we sound,
We play the gig and get out of town,
We get a break for just one night,
And then it's back to jaded eyes

If everybody sings along,
We might play your favorite song,
Or hopefully something that will suffice,
Every cough tastes like tofu and rice,
I don't get it,
I don't understand,
It's getting worse again and again
