EMPTY SODA CAN

OK, you've said enough,
You know I got the message,
Now you're just trying to make me feel like shit,
"You motherfucker",
"You can't leave now",
She was slurring vodka and tonics

This is very serious,
And I can't concentrate,
I get distracted by commercials on the TV,
I'm sorry but I have to,
Nothing you can say can make a difference any more

And I've got not [...?] planned,
Just an empty soda can,
Nothing to chase this down with,
And I've got no place to be,
Got no love for you and me,
You don't have to plead, that breaks my heart

But I don't care,
Is there life out there?

I've got a feeling, almost déjà vu,
Such a fear throughout this conversation,
We have more to drink,
We finish off the bottle,
The sun is just about to set

It's just a routine we do unconsciously,
You want to cry but you shout it out instead,
The phone is ringing,
No-one makes a move,
We just wait for a feeling we can recognise

And I've got not [...?] planned,
Just an empty soda can,
Nothing to chase this down with,
And I've got no place to be,
Got no love for you and me,
You don't have to plead, that breaks my heart

But I don't care,
Is there life out there?

OK, you've said enough,
You know I got the message,
Now you're just trying to make me feel like shit,
"You motherfucker",
"You can't leave now",
She was slurring vodka and tonics

This is very serious,
And I can't concentrate,
I get distracted by commercials on the TV,
I'm sorry but I have to,
Nothing you can say can make a difference any more
