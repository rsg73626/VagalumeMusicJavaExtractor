LAMA TEMPLE

I'm looking at the broken pieces on the floor,
There goes my magic key to success,
I've got to win back all of my alleged luck,
I'm going to Lama Temple, Chicago, Illinois

On the floor - I've got to...,
Out the door - I need to...,
On the floor - don't ask me why,
Out the door - don't ask me why

It's not so smart to burn your candles all day long,
It's not so smart risking bodily harm,
It's not so smart to burn your torch you whole life long,
It's sweet but I don't understand its charm

On the floor - I've got to...,
Out the door - I need to...,
On the floor - don't ask me why,
Out the door - don't ask me why

I'm looking at the broken pieces on the floor,
I can't tell if I'm just depressed or if I'm bored,
It takes a 9v just to start me up again,
I don't have the time to pretend

On the floor - I've got to...,
Out the door - I need to...,
On the floor - don't ask me why,
Out the door - don't ask me why

On the floor - I've got to...,
Out the door - I need to...,
On the floor - don't ask me why,
Out the door - don't ask me why
