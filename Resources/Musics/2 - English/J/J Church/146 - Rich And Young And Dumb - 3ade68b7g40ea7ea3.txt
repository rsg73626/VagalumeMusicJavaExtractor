RICH AND YOUNG AND DUMB

You're telling me that it's guaranteed,
You're the next big number one,
You may be right but there's a pretty good chance you're wrong,
You're telling me how it's supposed to be,
Yeah, your boys have got it all,
I can only hope that I'm still around when you fall

You're not anything,
You're rich and young and dumb,
There's a million more just like you where you come from,
You're not anything,
You're rich and young and dumb,
There's a million more just like you where you come from

You're telling me that you're special somehow,
Yeah, your single's in the charts,
Are you playing songs or are you just playing a part? 
You're telling me about everything,
MTV and the BBC,
Then you say that it all comes from the heart

You're not anything,
You're rich and young and dumb,
There's a million more just like you where you come from,
You're not anything,
You're rich and young and dumb,
There's a million more just like you where you come from

You're telling me that I don't understand,
That I lack the ambition,
They're gonna listen to your records long after you're gone,
You're telling me about your management team,
How I should give them a call,
But I'd rather walk than start to crawl

You're not anything,
You're rich and young and dumb,
There's a million more just like you where you come from,
You're not anything,
You're rich and young and dumb,
There's a million more just like you where you come from
