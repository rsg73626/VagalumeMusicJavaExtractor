AUSTIN'S SHITTY LIMITS

This is not a one-horse town,
If there’s a sound it might be coming from the underground,
Maybe not,
When it’s hot it’s really, really, really hot,
Drink a shot,
Drink a lot and let your blood start to clot

Think about your friends in the crowd,
There’s a shroud of stupidity that makes us proud and kind of old,
Take it from one who does not know,
Beer and bands will always be bought and sold

You want it,
You need it,
You got it,
Turn off your television, radio,
You want it,
You need it,
You got it,
Turn off your television, radio,
Television, radio,
Television, radio

If you listen to commercial radio,
Any show,
They’ll demonstrate how little that they know,
About the music that makes kids want to shout,
They haven’t noticed that Wilco is totally played out

Austin has at least a million bands with a plan,
To get rich working for the man,
It’s sort of sad,
Maybe not,
Maybe they deserve what they have got

You want it,
You need it,
You got it,
Turn off your television, radio,
You want it,
You need it,
You got it,
Turn off your television, radio,
Television, radio,
Television, radio

You want it,
You need it,
You got it,
Turn off your television, radio,
You want it,
You need it,
You got it,
Turn off your television, radio,
Television, radio,
Television, radio
