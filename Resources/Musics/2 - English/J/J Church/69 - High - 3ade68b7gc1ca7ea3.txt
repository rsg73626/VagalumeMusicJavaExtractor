HIGH

I was so high I couldn't come down,
She said with my motherâ€™s voice,
"There's no need to be afraid"

I'm not even sure why we even went out,
The sun was so hot,
It feels like just another day,
It feels like just...

I don't mean to sound paranoid,
But the cop on the corner has a look that I can't avoid,
That I can't avoid,
That I can't avoid

You would think that by now we would have known better,
The man with the badge,
He don't need an excuse,
He don't need an excuse,
He don't need an excuse

First it was me and then it was my friend,
A small pipe in her bag,
I won't make that mistake again,
I won't make that mistake again,
I won't make that...

As I got out at 2 A.M. I said,
"I'll never get high in Hancock Park again,
In Hancock Park again,
In Hancock Park again,
In Hancock Park again"
