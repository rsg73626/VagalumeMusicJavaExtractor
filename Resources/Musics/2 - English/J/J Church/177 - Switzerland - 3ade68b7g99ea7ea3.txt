SWITZERLAND

I am drawn by intrigue,
Could I ever live in Switzerland?
Could I ever please any number of secret societies?
This isn't Socrates,
It's not the roots of ancient trees,
Maybe disease,
The secret of secret societies

Should I go to Yale like my father's father's fathers?
I can cite examples,
Visions planted, superimposed,
If I can smell the trees can I smell the industry?
What's to beliefs?
Denial is a quality
