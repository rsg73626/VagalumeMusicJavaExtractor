YELLOW, BLUE, AND GREEN

You can go out tonight,
You can see him all right,
And he's been expecting you,
You can act so aloof,
But he's not looking for proof,
Every gesture he expects from you,
He expects from you

The worst marriage of all,
You don't love him at all,
And you might even hate him at times,
Now you hear what he says,
Your last alimony check,
Now you know this is the last goodbye
The last goodbye

Now it's even and fair,
Why do you even care?
There are no good times to remember you had,
Now he walks out the door,
You won't need him anymore,
For a moment you almost feel sad,
You almost feel sad
