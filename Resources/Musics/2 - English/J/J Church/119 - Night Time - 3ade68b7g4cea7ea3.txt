NIGHT TIME

The night time is the right time for you to leave that old wheelchair behind,
The night time is the only time you don't feel I'm staring at your lifeless legs,
You never read my books,
You said they were written with a poison pen,
But everything thatâ€™s old is new again

The night time is the right time for you to get out of that tattered dress,
I'll help you with your combat boots,
Never used and like brand new,
It's my turn to play a tape,
I feel like hearing the Minutemen,
But everything that's old is new again
