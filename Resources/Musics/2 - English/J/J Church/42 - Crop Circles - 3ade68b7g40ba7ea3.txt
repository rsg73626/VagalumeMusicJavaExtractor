CROP CIRCLES

Crop circles spell out your name,
It’s not pure and true,
But it’s love,
Is that good enough?
Good enough to justify me and you,
I’ve read the Guardian, read the Weekly,
Looking for stupid clues,
I guess I may not be good enough,
But I’m not looking for the truth

I know that it’s out of my hands (I know that it's not good enough to),
Don’t tell me I can understand (To justify me and you),
I’ll take each star from the sky (Ooh),
And lay them in fields organized

Girl so shy, scared and pale,
Clumsy though endearing,
I’ve got a numb sensation,
Ruins all my calculations,
Terrified of being wrong I’ve chosen not to choose,
So if you don’t mind I will wait forever

I know that it’s out of my hands (I know that it's not good enough to),
Don’t tell me I can understand (To justify me and you),
I’ll take each star from the sky (Ooh),
And lay them in fields organized

A nervous hand against my thigh,
The city cool like breezes by,
In the back of a yellow cab...,
I am yours and you are mine,
We’re so bored of the sunshine,
The evening becomes our time,
And I will wait forever

I know that it’s out of my hands (I know that it's not good enough to),
Don’t tell me I can understand (To justify me and you),
I’ll take each star from the sky (Ooh),
And lay them in fields organized
