JANE, VANESSA, AND I

Jane, Vanessa And I,
I, being Jean Seaberg,
Isolated in time,
Living intellectual crime,
Everybody's got a job to do,
From "Barbarella" to "Paint Your Wagon",
Stupid films from stupid minds,
Isolated in time

Nobody talks about it,
Nobody wants to know,
How can you see what isn't shown?
Nobody talks about it,
Nobody takes the blame,
You can't negotiate with shame

Jane, Vanessa And I,
I, the only physical victim,
Bring me my enemies,
List them alphabetically,
The FBI are no friends of mine,
Nobody told me that it was a crime,
You've got the guns, we've got the time,
Not "Breathless" but sublime

Nobody talks about it,
Nobody wants to know,
How can you see what isn't shown?
Nobody talks about it,
Nobody takes the blame,
You can't negotiate with shame
