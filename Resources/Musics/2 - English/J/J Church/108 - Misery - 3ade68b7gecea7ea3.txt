MISERY

Again, tonight I went to a bar with a friend,
Again, totally drunk holding on to this pen,
I see the whole world and its staring back at me,
Sitting here in misery, wondering what is wrong with me

Today, I'm so bored I think I'll sleep my life away,
Today, apathy stifles what I wanted to say,
I see the whole world and what a sorry place to be,
Sitting here in misery, drowning in society

Today, everyone suffered in the usual way,
Today, we leave uneasy because there's no escape,
I see the whole world and the possibility,
Sitting here in misery, no place that I'd rather be,
Sitting here in misery, no place that I'd rather be
