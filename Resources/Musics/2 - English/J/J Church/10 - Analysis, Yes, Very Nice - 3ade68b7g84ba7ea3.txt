ANALYSIS, YES, VERY NICE

It's simplistic presentation,
Your caustic realization,
Motivation in TV screens,
Vanguards built deliberately,
Feminization on every sex,
Stop, go back, re-read the test,
Feminization on every sex,
You're the anti-Oedipus

Who's remapping moral highways,
New speed limits you crave,
You think you're transforming infinity,
You're just lost in hyper-reality

What was easy to define now becomes so sublime,
What was easy to define you can dismiss as political lies

What was easy to define now becomes so sublime,
What was easy to define you can dismiss as political lies

Sweetest dreams, now go to sleep,
You've dug yourself too deep,
To summize, at all, morality,
Re-write your personality,
Analysis, yes, very nice,
It's changing almost every night,
Analysis, yes, very nice,
Maybe on some other night
