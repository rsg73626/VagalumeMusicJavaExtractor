FUCK SCHOOL

Kids are doing drugs,
Kids ignore the rules, 
What do you expect?
They're just surviving school,
Kids are fucking up,
Kids are fucking cruel,
Kids all fucking suck,
They're just surviving school

I don't like you, you don't like me,
Just leave me alone, just leave me be

We are the fucked-up kids, 
We hate the fucking jocks,
We hate the cheerleaders,
We hate them just because,
They talk their fucking shit,
They make up all the rules,
Can't wait to graduate,
They're nothing without school

I don't like you, you don't like me,
Just leave me alone, just leave me be

Fuck school,
Fuck school,
Fuck school,
Fuck school,
Fuck school
