A WELL EARNED REPUTATION

I take the PATH to the city,
The other three take the chance to sleep,
Lack of the same and I feel shitty,
My commute turns to a creep,
I walk in crowds on dirty streets,
Lack of sleep and swear it burns my eyes,
That's when I get that certain feeling,
Culture shock is only certain surprise

I've been prepared for another world,
Next stop is a party girl,
Her gravity is a trashy suction,
And she needs no introduction,
I get lost in a humid space,
If I can just find St. Mark's Place,
Hey, it's all going down tonight,
Junkie chic has earned the right

Summer's late and so am I,
I sweat down to my toes,
New York City unrefined to my too eager pose,
No time here for naiveté,
It drowns in overstimulation,
Kim's Underground and so blasé,
Suggests a well earned reputation
