THE STAR HOTEL

If nobody remembers the Star Hotel,
And its sad, lurid ghosts,
It's probably just as well,
Thinking through the stinking is not thinking a lot,
Reach into your jeans and see what you've got

Tuesday night is just alright,
I'm nauseous but happy,
Tuesday night is just alright

Close your eyes and realize this is it,
Is it what you imagined?

The walls are dead and peeling,
They don't watch the door,
I used to fetishize the girls,
Now I fetishize the floor,
The carpet's tiny razors,
Bits of glass and bone,
Sleeping is an option if you can get alone

Tuesday night is just alright,
I'm nauseous but I'm happy,
Tuesday night is just alright

Close your eyes and realize this is it,
Is it what you imagined?

Close your eyes and realize this is it,
Is it what you imagined?
