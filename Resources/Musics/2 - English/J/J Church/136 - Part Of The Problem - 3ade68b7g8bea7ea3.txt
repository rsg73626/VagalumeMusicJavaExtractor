PART OF THE PROBLEM

Burn down the buildings, riot in the streets,
Just stay out of my neighbourhood,
Carry your banners in your protest march,
But I don't feel it does any good

I might agree with everything that you do,
But if I'm part of the problem,
Then you're part of the problem too

Stumble home drunk in the middle of the night,
I try to walk where it is light,
Despite my sight, I feel all right,
I know that it's not very bright

I might agree with everything that you do,
But if I'm part of the problem,
Then you're part of the problem too

I'm not sure what you're asking,
But I know that I don't have the answer,
As if it makes any difference to you

I'm not sure what you're asking,
But I know I don't know the answer,
I'm reading, writing, doing something,
But at the end of the day I'm nothing,
I can throw my life away from Monday to Friday,
But I will not live like you
