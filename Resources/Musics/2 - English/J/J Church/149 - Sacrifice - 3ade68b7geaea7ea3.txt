SACRIFICE

She said she wouldn't sacrifice a life constructed on passion,
A red device,
To say she could be traded or bought,
I know that it's a bankrupt thought,
I know,
The fetish that controls your mind has come too easy to define

She said she wouldn't give herself away,
"No tomorrow" everyday,
Their revolution and their plight is changing almost every night,
No hope of spontaneity,
Regenerated society

"Is that all there is?" you say,
"Is that all there is?" you say,
'Cause I've been traveling so far and I've looked so hard,
And I think I've lost my way,
"Is that all there is?" you say,
"Is that all there is?" you say,
'Cause I've been traveling so far and I've looked so hard,
And I think I've lost my way
