SMOKE IN MY FACE

I don't drink everything,
She won't stop at anything,
She won't wait for me,
I don't smoke anything,
I don't mind living at her place,
I don't mind her smoke in my face

She helped me move out of Hollywood,
She gave me the reason,
That I would leave for good

I saw the scar from when she tried to shoot herself,
The bullet passed through her arm,
I canâ€™t change anything,
But her sadness and her pain somehow drew my cruelty

We grew apart every time she cried,
I would always hold her,
But it always felt like a lie,
She left town,
Formal goodbyes,
Same old speech,
I blew my last chance,
Fucked apology,
It don't mean anything,
Rest my feet, Kingsley Street,
I knew we couldn't stay in touch,
I knew it could never be love
