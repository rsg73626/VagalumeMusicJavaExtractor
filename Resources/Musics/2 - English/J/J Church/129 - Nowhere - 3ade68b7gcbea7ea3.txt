NOWHERE

The dirt in the air is some atmosphere,
The sun hangs low,
There's nowhere like here,
School is out and we pile in the car,
Get away from everyday, but never too far

You are, you are, you are everything,
In this town that kills anything,
You are, you are, you are my starshine,
Now let's kiss the city and wave goodbye

I know the feeling of stealing away,
All of our lives caught up in the fray,
This town makes you wonder why you deserve this,
This town makes you wonder if you even exist

You are, you are, you are everything,
In this town that kills anything,
You are, you are, you are my starshine,
Now let's kiss the city and wave goodbye
