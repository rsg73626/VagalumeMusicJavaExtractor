CASE NUMBER

I can fill out a million forms,
I can stand in lines and lines and lines,
I could fill out a million more,
If only I had more time

I can tell that you’re looking at me,
You can tell that I’m a slob,
I know you’re not very efficient,
I know you’re just doing your job

I see you, I see you,
Yeah I see you,
I don’t know your name, I don’t know your name,
I don’t know your fucking name,
I see you, I see you,
Yeah I see you,
I don’t know your name, I don’t know your name,
I don’t know your fucking name

We all meet in this room,
It’s the bottom line,
Maintain my poverty,
It’s just a waste of time

This room has a million chairs,
This room has fluorescent lights,
And a smell I’ll always associate,
With unemployment lines

I see you, I see you,
Yeah I see you,
I don’t know your name, I don’t know your name,
I don’t know your fucking name,
I see you, I see you,
Yeah I see you,
I don’t know your name, I don’t know your name,
I don’t know your fucking name

I can tell that you’re looking at me,
You can tell that I’m a slob,
I know you’re not very efficient,
I know you’re just doing your job
