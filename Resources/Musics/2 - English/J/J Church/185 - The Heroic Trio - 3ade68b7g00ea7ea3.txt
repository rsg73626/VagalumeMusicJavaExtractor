THE HEROIC TRIO

Something had to happen,
Something had to change,
Babies vanishing, sacrificed,
To a eunuch with no name,
Make a move,
Things to choose,
Either way you're bound to lose,
Even Wonder Woman sometimes sings the blues

Hey you! (Hey you!)
It's true! (It's true!)
I've got news for you,
Nothing you can do

No need to get worried,
No need to give in,
The babies are all born on dates destined to be King,
Sometimes I get lonely,
Maybe it's just me,
But Michelle, Anita and Maggie Cheung are all I ever need

Hey you! (Hey you!)
It's true! (It's true!)
I've got news for you,
Nothing you can do

Hey you! (Hey you!)
It's true! (It's true!)
I've got news for you,
Nothing you can do
