WILLIAM TELL SUICIDE NOTE

You make your claim; required reading,
The glazed pork demands more, he thinks it's a feeling,
You make your claim, your mind reeling,
You're sick on his prick, your mind congealing

Tried burning out and living in the darkest room,
You'll find me at the house all day,
Tried losing out, but losers can be fools,
There's got to be another way

I've seen it all before,
Nothing doing anymore

Starry eyed and contrived...
We'll burn you library,
Outrageous is contagious but not philosophy,
My slander is a noble gesture to avenge a murdered wife,
So sad, you're dead,
Could you have been alive

Tried burning out and living in the darkest room,
You'll find me at the house all day,
Tried losing out, but losers can be fools,
There's got to be another way

I've seen it all before,
Nothing doing anymore

Tried burning out and living in the darkest room,
You'll find me at the house all day,
Tried losing out, but losers can be fools,
There's got to be another way
