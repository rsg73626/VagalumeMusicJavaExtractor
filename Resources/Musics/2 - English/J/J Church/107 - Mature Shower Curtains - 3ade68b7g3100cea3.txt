MATURE SHOWER CURTAINS

She leaves the window open,
She leaves the door unlocked,
She leaves the porch light on,
She thinks that it’s enough

She wants mature curtains,
To keep her bathroom dry,
She thinks I think about it,
She’s thinking something right

I’ll cut you close,
I’ll cut you off,
‘Cos you can’t live without it,
You’re making notes above your nose,
So you can dream about it,
When I’m done and had enough,
You will think about it,
You will imagine all your luck,
And start to live around it

I sleep an inch above the floor,
The insects make it past my door,
They watch me sleep, they watch me snore,
Dream of less - dream of more

She is a drink I’ve had before,
At the Honky Death liquor store,
On the California shore,
I’m rotten to my core

I’ll cut you close,
I’ll cut you off,
‘Cos you can’t live without it,
You’re making notes above your nose,
So you can dream about it,
When I’m done and had enough,
You will think about it,
You will imagine all your luck,
And start to live around it
