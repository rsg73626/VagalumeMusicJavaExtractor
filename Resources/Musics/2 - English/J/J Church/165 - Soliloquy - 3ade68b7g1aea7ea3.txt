SOLILOQUY

While I feel lucky, I still regret,
I never got my second chance,
The photos I took as documentation,
Blend my personal mythologies

A sad soliloquy,
As much for you as it is for me,
A sad soliloquy,
I won't expect anything
A sad soliloquy,
As much for you as it is for me,
A sad soliloquy,
I won't expect anything

I only know what I'm shown,
I can tell my mind was blown,
It's what I need to feel something,
Something,
Anything

A sad soliloquy,
As much for you as it is for me,
A sad soliloquy,
I won't expect anything
A sad soliloquy,
As much for you as it is for me,
A sad soliloquy,
I won't expect anything
