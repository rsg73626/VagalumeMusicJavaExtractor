SLEEP

Someone is sleeping on my street,
I step over them because I need my coffee,
Someone is playing in the hall,
I hope they donâ€™t grow up at all,
And burn my house down

I don't think I ever sleep,
There are too many things I need,
I don't think I ever sleep,
There's nothing here I really need

Someone smells like piss and shit,
I guess it's only appropriate,
If you could see my elbow,
Still, I know my liquor store,
And what's in the rice and beans,
While I have nothing to move

I don't think I ever sleep,
There are too many things I need,
I don't think I ever sleep,
There's nothing here I really need

My landlord's coming around again,
And I don't catch a word he says,
I guess it's not important,
Junkies lying in the hall,
It's not romantic here at all,
It's just a cheap excuse to be driven to drink,
Driven to drink, driven to drink,
Driven to drink, driven to drink, driven to drink,
Driven to drink, driven to drink, driven to drink,
Driven to drink, driven to drink, driven to drink
