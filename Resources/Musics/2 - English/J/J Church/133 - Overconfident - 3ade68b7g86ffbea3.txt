OVERCONFIDENT

History is all a mystery,
Fiction’s all we ever have,
You worship Nico,
You spit on Yoko,
Here’s another thing that you don’t know

We are nothing more than all the things that came before,
We’re just playing it by ear,
There is no music history,
So let’s enjoy the mystery,
Theory is hobby here

You never could write her story,
In fact, you’re getting it all wrong,
Overconfident,
Undergraduate,
Your expertise is false alarm

We are nothing more than all the things that came before,
We’re just playing it by ear,
There is no music history,
So let’s enjoy the mystery,
Theory is hobby here
