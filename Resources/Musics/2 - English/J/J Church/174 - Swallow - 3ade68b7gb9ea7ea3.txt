SWALLOW

I have no reason to think this season is in itself to blame,
The phone it doesn't ring,
And so I do my thing,
What time is it back home?

"You've got no messages today",
"I find no fax I'm sorry to say",
"I won't check again",
Another Dover stop,
If I jump from the hill top?
Will that just be vain?

So now I'm swallowing my pride,
I've got little left to hide, 
(I'm not going home tonight), 
Now I'm swallowing my pride,
And I don't want you to decide, 
(I'm not going home tonight), 
She said my dreams are only lies,
I can't so why do I even try? 
(I'm not going home tonight) 
Now I'm swallowing my pride,
Was it really worth the price? 
(I'm not going home tonight) 

I'll try to call again,
You may pick up and then,
Here is your chance,
You can make me feel small,
And wish I hadn't called,
Or you'll save my life

So now I'm swallowing my pride,
I've got little left to hide, 
(I'm not going home tonight), 
Now I'm swallowing my pride,
And I don't want you to decide, 
(I'm not going home tonight), 
She said my dreams are only lies,
I can't so why do I even try? 
(I'm not going home tonight) 
Now I'm swallowing my pride,
Was it really worth the price? 
(I'm not going home tonight)
