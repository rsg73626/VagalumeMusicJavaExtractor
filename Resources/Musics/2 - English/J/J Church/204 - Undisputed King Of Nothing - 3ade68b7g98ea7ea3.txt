UNDISPUTED KING OF NOTHING

My images come so fast and clear,
You’ll never know I was here,
Every chance is a sacred dance,
Don’t step on my career

Why are you being such an asshole?
You’re not making anything better,
Like I need a reason to write that stupid fuck a letter

I am the undisputed king of an infinite amount of nothing,
Don’t correct me when I’m wrong,
I’m proud to wear the crown of fools

Na na na na na,
Nothing from nothing is nothing,
Na na na na na,
Nothing from nothing is nothing,
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Nothing from nothing is nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,
Nothing from nothing is nothing

Late for lunch, late for dinner,
I’ve always been a late beginner,
I can’t turn off the MTV,
Now I know it’s killing me

Drinks are on the house,
Nobody will hear a sound,
Cry alone in the Men’s Room,
The Men’s Room of all places

I am the undisputed king of an infinite amount of nothing,
Don’t correct me when I’m wrong,
I’m proud to wear the crown of fools

Na na na na na,
Nothing from nothing is nothing,
Na na na na na,
Nothing from nothing is nothing,
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Nothing from nothing is nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,
Nothing from nothing is nothing
