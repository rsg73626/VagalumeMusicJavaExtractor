PARKAS AND FLAGS

Hey, does the sound just grate?
Hey, well it's a bit too late,
The mods look like Vulcans in parkas and flags,
The mods look like Vulcans in expensive rags,
The mods look like Vulcans and I don't want to look like that

Talking 'bout my generation,
Talking 'bout my generation,
Talking 'bout my generation,
I can't explain my generation

Hey, do you look great,
Hey, why are you afraid,
The kids are wearing their parents clothes,
The kids are wearing silver and gold,
They used to be wearing tattoos and boots and piercings in their nose

Talking 'bout my generation,
Talking 'bout my generation,
Talking 'bout my generation,
I can't explain my generation
