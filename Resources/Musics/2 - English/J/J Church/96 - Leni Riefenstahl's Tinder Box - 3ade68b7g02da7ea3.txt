LENI RIEFENSTAHL'S TINDER BOX

There is no time to sympathize,
With Leni Riefenstahl,
Art is not created in a void,
Any act of outrage,
Cannot see through the tears,
Wept for the fallen Führer

Take to the green hills of Africa,
We all know how photos lie,
Sink to the bottom of the ocean,
You will never see Olympia

He was the tinderbox,
Lit Leni Riefenstahl,
Art for art's sake is a lie,
Talent's lonely virtue,
Both profane and divine,
Projecting noxious visions

Take to the green hills of Africa,
We all know how photos lie,
Sink to the bottom of the ocean,
You will never see Olympia

There is no time to redefine,
Leni Riefenstahl,
Ignorance may be her only crime,
Forget the Führer,
Forget the images,
Art for art's sake is a lie

Take to the green hills of Africa,
We all know how photos lie,
Sink to the bottom of the ocean,
You will never see Olympia,
You will never see Olympia,
You will never see Olympia,
See Olympia
