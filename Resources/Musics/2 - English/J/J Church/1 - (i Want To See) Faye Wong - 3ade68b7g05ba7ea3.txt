(I WANT TO SEE) FAYE WONG

Saw her in a sandwich shop a million miles away,
She acts (if maybe not the best) and I think it's okay,
She sings her simple new wave songs with alien inspiration,
I collect her photos from Yes! Communication

I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
So I can try to sing along,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
So I can try to sing along

I don't know any titles of any of her songs,
I thought I wouldn't like it but I found out I was wrong,
Hands on eyes and ears and mouth, don't make any sense,
I would be her Tony Leung if given half the chance

I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
So I can try to sing along,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
So I can try to sing along

I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
So I can try to sing along,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
I want to see Faye Wong,
So I can try to sing along
