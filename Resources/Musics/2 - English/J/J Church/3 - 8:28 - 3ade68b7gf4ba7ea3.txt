8:28

You're in and out and about,
At best you act suspicious,
I can accept if you don't love me,
Please pretend for my sanity,
Just make it through this season,
I can't give you any reason,
You can say that I don't really know you,
But we both know that's a lie

Love comes and goes,
Surely you would know,
I can plagiarize again,
But I won't

I won't give you your diamond rings,
If you don't return all of my things,
8:28 I'll always hate,
8:28 you took the bait,
You say you'll be alone tonight,
You're going out yourself tonight,
You tell me it will be all right,
But I know what's on your mind

Love comes and goes,
Surely you would know,
I can plagiarize again,
But I won't

Love comes and goes,
Surely you would know,
I can plagiarize again,
But I won't
