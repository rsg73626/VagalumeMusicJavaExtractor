NEW YEAR

I'm hoping that this new year,
Is better than the last one...,
'Cause me and my loneliness,
Could sure use a divorce

Not that it's any fault of my own,
Not that I've ever stood fast and hard,
Check in, now start,
You hurry up and wait,
I've read every magazine,
La la la la la

I'm hoping that this new year,
Is better than the last one...,
'Cause me and my loneliness,
Could sure use a divorce

There are people determined to ruin my life,
This year I'll anticipate their modus operandi,
They laugh, they smile,
They say its guaranteed,
Tell me that it's good as done,
La la la la la

I'm hoping that this new year,
Is better than the last one...,
'Cause me and my loneliness,
Could sure use a divorce
