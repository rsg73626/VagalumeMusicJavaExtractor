SOCIETY IS A CARNIVOROUS FLOWER

(Part 1)
One more day to stare into space,
One more day in this boring place,
Blank expression on your face,
Drink your coffee, complex aftertaste,
One more day trapped in a room,
One more day of nothing new,
Surrounded by more of the same,
Are they as bored as you?
Are they angry too?

The campus, the womb, is serene,
The city surrounds in its machine,
The world nullifies, it surrounds,
Don’t you wanna burn it down?

One more night in inter-zone,
One more night you’re all alone,
One more empty conversation,
Theories and devastation,
One more night to share a bed,
Afraid to talk, you fuck instead,
But what goes on inside her head?
Anything? Everything?

The campus, the womb, is serene,
The city surrounds in its machine,
The world nullifies, it surrounds,
Don’t you wanna burn it down?

Diodes and electrodes,
Nails and bolts and beams,
Anatomically correct US war machines,
Bombs are built like TV sets, cars and stereos,
Vietnam’s the target audience that you don’t know

You’re not Galileo, you’re not Copernicus,
You sit and stare from the Nanterre’s numbing bliss,
You’re not Galileo, you’re not Copernicus,
You sit and stare from the Nanterre’s numbing bliss

You’ve seen the factories of Renault,
You’ve heard of the class system at the Sorbonne,
You fetishize the workers and their plight,
Guilt confirms your intellectual flight

You’re not Galileo, you’re not Copernicus,
Sit and stare from the Nanterre’s numbing bliss,
You’re not Galileo, you’re not Copernicus,
Sit and stare from the Nanterre’s numbing bliss

The sound is violence,
The sound is ecstatic,
The sound is like fucking,
A beautiful panic,
All that is left of your sleepless science fiction is the revolution’s residue,
Practicing urban vampires

Tonight there is danger,
No longer a stranger it seems,
Dreaming behind barricades,
I can’t sleep,
Tonight there is danger,
It’s killing this city’s disease,
The light is so bright in my head,
I can’t sleep

The right wing is talking,
And the left wing is balking,
All of them stopping you from kicking it over,
Caught by surprise,
Forced into compromise,
When you win the trade unions you’ll know it’s a movement

Tonight there is danger,
No longer a stranger it seems,
Dreaming behind barricades,
I can’t sleep,
Tonight there is danger,
It’s killing this city’s disease,
The light is so bright in my head,
I can’t sleep

Don’t know if they were offended by their anti-Semitic leaders,
Don’t know if they remembered the experiments of Spain,
Don’t know if they were sick of de Gaulle and his lackeys,
Don’t know if they were horrified of having a boss for the rest of their days

The trade unions are coming!
The trade unions are coming!
The trade unions are coming!
The trade unions are coming!

May 15, 1968, a black flag waved over the factory,
Collectivizing is inadvertent when a wildcat strike takes the whole country,
Bakers kept on baking,
Fishers kept on fishing,
Canteens kept on serving,
Dreams became reality became slogans

The workers terrified the bureaucracy,
Free love terrified the bourgeoisie,
Imagine the hilarity,
“Free love is neither love nor free”,
A moral threat to society,
A political threat to decency,
Imagine fucking in a factory,
In all honesty there’s not much intrigue

(Part 4)
When all is said and done,
Despair is just a loaded gun,
It turns into something more,
In the hands of anyone ready for war,
The war for dignity,
Workers, farmers, universities,
Even when you lose,
There’s a glimpse of a future you can choose

When all is said and done,
If the students chose the Summer sun,
And the middle class gave into tradition,
And the all the illusion it brings,
They can never win,
We’ll be coming back again,
They can never win,
History is deafening
