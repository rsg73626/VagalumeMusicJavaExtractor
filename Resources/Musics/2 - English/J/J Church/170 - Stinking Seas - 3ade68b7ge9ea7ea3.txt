STINKING SEAS

All the dishes in the sink sit as cold as the floor,
It's a monument to affluence,
Words carry no quintessence

You're out of time,
You're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time,
You're out of time,
You're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time

All the records out of jackets scratch themselves one by one,
And the deejay takes no requests on his voicemail line

You're out of time,
You're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time,
You're out of time,
You're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time, you're out of time

Stinking seas of ambivalence clog your pores as you dive in,
This is real cash money,
These are not amphetamines
