ANYBODY

She's an anybody,
She'll be anybody's anything,
She says "Anything with anyone
Must surely be OK."
She says she wants to have a good time,
I'm somehow skeptical,
Her leopard print winter coat,
Is buttoned up for war

She talks like Julie Christie,
Implied sex and foreign intrigue,
It's the accent that really gets me,
She laughs to make a smile

She never takes her car,
Says it's an excuse to go home,
She complicates her profundity,
With whom she goes to bed,
She says she wants to have some fun,
She's looking out for number one,
With masked affairs in the toilet,
And she's only just begun

She talks like Julie Christie,
Implied sex and foreign intrigue,
It's the accent that really gets me,
She laughs to make a smile

She's an anybody,
A plaything for the anythings,
She says "How can it be wrong,
To have such a nice time?"
Her fishnet crossed legs,
Cross-eyed in the dregs,
She says "My favorite accidents,
Are purely by design."

She talks like Julie Christie,
Implied sex and foreign intrigue,
It's the accent that really gets me,
She laughs to make a smile
