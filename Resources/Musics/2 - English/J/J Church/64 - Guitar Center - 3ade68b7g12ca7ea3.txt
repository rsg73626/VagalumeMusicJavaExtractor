GUITAR CENTER

Back when I was 14 years old,
I bought a Hondo Explorer style guitar

Yeah, my first guitar,
You can keep your stupid lies,
You can keep your leather ties

Now we want the San Diego sound,
Now we want the Les Paul Standard sound

Yeah, my next guitar,
You can keep your stupid lies,
You can keep your leather ties

Yeah, my first guitar,
You can keep your stupid lies,
You can keep your leather ties
