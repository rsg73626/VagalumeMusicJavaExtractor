NOTHING WORTH KNOWING

Smiling newscaster,
She reports the tragedy,
We must share the same secret joke,
Or aren't we laughing at the same thing?

Public feigning outrage,
But these are caustic times,
The only honest outrage,
Is yet to be outlined,
Is yet to be outlined,
Is yet to be outlined,
Is yet to be outlined

No no no no,
No no no no,
No no no no

He can look you in the eye,
You know he sees nothing,
He looks into a million eyes,
He won't tell you anything

At least nothing worth knowing,
Follow his moving lips,
He's an empty oral tradition,
He's a fucked-up piece of shit,
He's a fucked-up piece of shit,
He's a fucked-up piece of shit,
He's a fucked-up piece of shit
