DESPERATION EVERY OTHER NIGHT

The lights change to a steady blink,
My poisoned mind make me stop and think,
It's not a feeling deep inside of me,
Just a cover to survive my misery

Sad news has taken flight,
Desperation every other night

The wind's a needle jabbing in my vein,
Gravity is coming down like rain,
The bar becomes a false community,
When you stumble home you're alone but not free

Sad news has taken flight,
Desperation every other night

I'm in home and I'm too tired to see,
I've got a motherfucking headache and it's killing me,
I lie awake on my bedroom floor,
I'm alive but I'm not drunk anymore

No-one wins, doesn't make it right,
Desperation every other night
