CRAZY LADY ON MARKET STREET

1983,
She had turned 15,
She ran away from home to see the dream

On her second night,
She met a man who had nothing to hide,
But turned her around to work the streets at night

Introspected, infected,
Self-conscious and projected,
No tomorrow, no today,
Can there be a better way?

She's been assaulted twice,
Once by a stranger and once by the Vice,
She's probably lucky that she's still alive

She's got a girlfriend,
Who got her hooked on heroin,
She quits every week but then makes the same mistake again

I saw her just last week,
Down on 6th and Market Street,
It was something that I did not want to see

She's one step away,
From ending up this way,
If it's good enough for you it's good enough for me

Introspected, infected,
Self-conscious and projected,
No tomorrow, no today,
Can there be a better way?
