NO SURPRISE

I can't sleep,
A tidal wave of stress is overwhelming me,
When I finally clear my head,
It's only when I feel the world is dead,
And back at school,
I never was tough and I never was cool,
I said "A tough girl is what I need in my life",
You laughed and said: "It's no surprise"

It's no surprise,
Surprise, surprise, surprise,
It's no surprise

And back at home,
Mom and Dad were drunk or fighting, I was all alone,
I had to get away,
So I watched girl's basketball practice every single day,
Yeah it's still cool,
It's been a long time since I thought about my school,
Not like you were always on my mind,
But if you were it's no surprise

It's no surprise,
Surprise, surprise, surprise,
It's no surprise

My girlfriend,
I'm only 17 and dating a lesbian,
At times it seems so strange to me,
To know that she'll see things I’ll never see,
Yeah, it's okay,
It’s been a long time since I thought about those days,
I missed our class reunion last night,
If you did too it's no surprise,
It's no surprise,
Surprise, surprise, surprise,
It's no surprise
