BIRTHDAY

I thought it was your turn to feel alone,
But I knew I was wrong when I hung up the phone,
You’ve got Mom’s eyes and so do I,
Evident in every tone

So I write another letter,
But it all adds up to nothing,
Today is your birthday,
Have a happy birthday,
There’s nothing that you wanted

I thought I would have a good explanation,
I wanna go back for your high school graduation,
When you cut your lines through the midnight brine,
It’ll be to your best advantage

So I write another letter,
But it all adds up to nothing,
Today is your birthday,
Have a happy birthday,
There’s nothing that you wanted

So I write another letter,
But it all adds up to nothing,
Today is your birthday,
Have a happy birthday,
There’s nothing that you wanted
