NO DOVES FLY HERE

The sky is empty and it's turning different shades of colour
It never did before and we never asked for more
My mind is empty and my body different shades of torture
It never was before and we never asked for more

No-one is moving and no doves fly here
No-one is thinking and no doves fly here
No-one remembers beyond all this fear
No doves fly here

No doves fly here
No doves fly here
No doves fly here
No doves fly here
