SYMBOLS

I've got anticipation,
You see the complication,
The heat is rising from the centre coil,
Someone's talking,
Someone's nodding,
And I'm waiting for my water to boil

Out in the streetlight,
I see the dogs fight,
I feel the breeze come through the screen,
Uneasy feeling,
My mind is reeling,
And I don't know what the symbols mean
