SUNSHINE

Sunshine,
Boring sunshine,
Tripping amphetamine,
Sick inspiration,
Sunshine,
Who needs sunshine?
Leaves me paralyzed,
Sweet perspiration

And I don't want you around,
I'm a nightmare when I'm down,
And I'm going to the darker side of town

Starlight,
It's only midnight,
Smoke your Camel Light,
Your ride is coming,
Bus ride,
To the seaside,
Geary late at night,
The drugs are humming

And the Cliff House is alone,
And it feels like coming home,
And nothing I can do can make it wrong

Childlike,
On the outside,
Tried and crucified,
Don't wanna live forever,
Floodlight,
Thick, dripping, dark night,
Loss of appetite,
Let's die together

And I don't want to be your clown,
And I can't keep my food down,
When I call, you won't hear a sound
