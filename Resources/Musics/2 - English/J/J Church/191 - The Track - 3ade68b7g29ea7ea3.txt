THE TRACK

January blows through the track,
You're too hot to feel it on your back,
All alone with everyone,
Do you still remember fun?
Tonight the darkness of the 'loin,
You'll need more than a bunch of coins,
She's there for you but not to stay,
You're invisible anyway

I can't hear a thing you say,
(There's a place where we can go)
I can't hear a thing you say,
(Nobody will ever know)
I can't hear a thing you say,
(There's a place where we can go, we are invisible)
I can't hear a thing you say

Loneliness is a part of trust,
Now you give yourself to lust,
If you're looking for love then you're out of luck,
And a blowjob costs you fifty bucks,
Walk around most of the night,
You have to wonder about your life,
The further that you go,
The less you seem to know

I can't hear a thing you say,
(There's a place where we can go)
I can't hear a thing you say,
(Nobody will ever know)
I can't hear a thing you say,
(There's a place where we can go, we are invisible)
I can't hear a thing you say

In broken English, she says to you,
"Hey, I know something we can do,
Do you wanna for a while?"
You wanna believe the smile,
There comes a point when even sex,
Seems empty and irrelevant,
"Can't you stay a while?"

I can't hear a thing you say,
(There's a place where we can go)
I can't hear a thing you say,
(Nobody will ever know)
I can't hear a thing you say,
(There's a place where we can go, we are invisible)
I can't hear a thing you say
