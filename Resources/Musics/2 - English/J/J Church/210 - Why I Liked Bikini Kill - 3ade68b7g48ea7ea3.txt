WHY I LIKED BIKINI KILL

You think you’ve got a lot to say and I’ve got a lot to hear,
You don’t hear a thing,
Your defenses are acting up,
It’s some surprise to me,
You don’t hear a thing

You don’t care about what they’re doing,
You just want to have an opinion,
Look at yourself,
You don’t do nothing

Drunk on wine,
Saving time,
I remember the first time...

You’re so scared of alienation,
You’re so scared of segregation,
You don’t hear a thing,
You write your words with a poison pen,
It’s some surprise to me,
You don’t hear a thing

You don’t care about what they’re doing,
You just want to have an opinion,
Look at yourself,
You don’t do nothing

Drunk on wine,
Saving time,
I remember the first time...
