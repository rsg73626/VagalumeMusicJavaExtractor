SWEET TALKIN' WOMAN

I was searchin' (searchin') down a one-way street,
I was hopin' (hopin') for a chance to meet,
I was waiting for the operator on the line,
She's gone so long, what can I do?
Where could she be? Oh no no,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I've gotta get back to you

Slow down, sweet talkin' woman (slow down),
You got me runnin' (run run), you got me searchin',
Hold on, sweet talkin' woman,
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

I was walkin', many days go by,
I was thinkin' (thinkin' 'bout the) 'bout the lonely nights,
Communication breakdown all around,
She's gone so long, what can I do?
Where could she be? Oh no no,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I've gotta get back to you

Slow down, sweet talkin' woman (slow down),
You got me runnin' (run run), you got me searchin',
Hold on, sweet talkin' woman,
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

I've been livin' (livin') on a dead end street,
I've been askin' (everybody) everybody I meet,
Insufficient data coming through
She's gone so long, what can I do?
Where could she be? Oh no no,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I've gotta get back to you

Slow down, sweet talkin' woman (slow down),
You got me runnin' (run run), you got me searchin',
Hold on, sweet talkin' woman,
It's so sad if that's the way it's over,
Slow down, sweet talkin' woman (slow down),
You got me runnin' (run run), you got me searchin',
Hold on, sweet talkin' woman,
It's so sad if that's the way it's over,
Slow down, sweet talkin' woman (slow down),
You got me runnin' (run run), you got me searchin',
Hold on, sweet talkin' woman,
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
