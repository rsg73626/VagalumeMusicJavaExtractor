COLORS LIE

All of my dreams end in the drain,
I’m walking outside in the pouring rain,
Colors flash, colors lie,
Cars all pass me by,
The more you decipher and understand,
Reality is a gun in your hand,
Is it pointing at the bank or pointing at your head?

Don’t you want to try?
[Could it make you want to die?]?
They’re getting up to go,
But they don’t wanna know

All of my dreams now end in vain,
It’s Friday night and I’m here again,
All of my best friends are hecklers in the end,
If I read every page in every book,
Compassion is treasured and I am a crook,
Crippled by my shame,
And I’ve only myself to blame

Don’t you want to try?
[Could it make you want to die?]?
They’re getting up to go,
But they don’t wanna know

All of my dreams now end in vain
I know that I’m singing this song again,
It’s boring,
Once again,
Alienation in all of my scenes,
But I’m fighting with alienated means,
Crippled by my shame,
And I’ve only myself to blame

Don’t you want to try?
[Could it make you want to die?]?
They’re getting up to go,
But they don’t wanna know,
No!
