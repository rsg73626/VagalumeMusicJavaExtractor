PARTS UNKNOWN

When counting houses on my street,
The architecture ain’t so unique,
The walls crawl and the windows creep,
Don't lie, they tell no stories

I’m dying underneath the light,
I’m trying to get out despite the gravity of the home town team killing me

You can be the Queen and you can set the tone,
Convince yourself you’re in the danger zone,
You can travel in the parts unknown,
I am unknown,
I am unknown

Broken dreams are on my street,
The sidewalk speaks with senility,
The sidewalk doesn’t say anything,
It’s not responding to anything,
And I want to leave this town behind,
Pack my crap and take a ride,
Find there’s nothing I can find tonight

You can be the Queen and you can set the tone,
Convince yourself you’re in the danger zone,
You can travel in the parts unknown,
I am unknown,
I am unknown

Broken dreams are on my street,
The sidewalk speaks with senility,
The sidewalk doesn’t say anything,
It’s not responding to anything,
And I want to leave this town behind,
Pack my crap and take a ride
