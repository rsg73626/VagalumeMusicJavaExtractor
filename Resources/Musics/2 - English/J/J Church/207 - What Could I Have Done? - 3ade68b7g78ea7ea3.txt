WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE?

I remember when we said goodbye,
I didn’t know it would be the last time I’d see you alive,
I never had your fear of death,
But a certain fear of what I don’t expect

And I do see what’s in front of me,
Now I ask myself the same old things,
What could I have done?
What could I have said?
Before I read in the paper that you were dead

You never liked the things I had to say,
Now every ideology has melted away,
As I sing this song again and again and again,
All of the meaning has jumped to its end

And I do see what’s in front of me,
And I ask myself the same old things,
What could I have done?
What could I have said?
Before I read in the paper that you were dead

There are skeletons in the closet,
And there are roaches in the kitchen sink,
And I can’t go back to that house,
There are too many memories there left for me

And I do see what was in front of me,
And I ask myself the same old things,
What could I have done?
What could I have said?
Before I read in the paper that you were dead,
You were dead
