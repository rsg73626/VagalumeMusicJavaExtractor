PRIEST

The priest waits for the train,
He leaves today,
He says "How could I have been so wrong for so long",
He lights his last cigarette,
He quits today,
What better way to leave than turning a new leaf

"Tell your mom I'm coming home,
Tell your mom I'm coming home"

The priest drinks from a flask,
It keeps him warm,
He says "I've felt this way before",
The book is a book,
The cross is wood,
The priest is a man

"Tell your mom I'm coming home,
Tell your mom I'm coming home"
