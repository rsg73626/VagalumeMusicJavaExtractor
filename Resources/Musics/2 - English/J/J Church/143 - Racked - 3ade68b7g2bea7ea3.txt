RACKED

This morning I was racked by an all consuming feeling of regret,
Vague memories of tragedies,
Dionysian polemics,
Emphasized by my splitting headache

This forgettable day...,
That I have thrown away,
The booze and you are here with me,
You're in my mouth, youâ€™re on my teeth,
And I'm alone,
And I'm alone,
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, alone

Your words filled my head,
I drank away to deaden all the pain,
I drank one, it turned to four,
On the floor and I drank more,
Now I'm never seeing you again,
I'm not drinking again,
No I'm never ever drinking again,
The stench it rises from my pores,
Mind and body tired and sore,
And I'm alone,
And I'm alone,
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, alone

I'm not drinking again,
No I'm never ever drinking again,
The stench it rises from my pores,
Mind and body tired and sore,
And I'm alone,
And I'm alone,
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, alone

I'm not drinking again,
No I'm never ever drinking again,
The stench it rises from my pores,
Mind and body tired and sore,
And I'm alone,
And I'm alone,
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, alone
