YOUR SHIRT

You say "It's all right",
Never asking my price,
You think you're cool,
But it's my high school

I've been broke,
I'll be broke again,
You would think I'd done enough for you,
(You would think I'd done enough for you),
You would think I'd done enough for you,
(You would think I'd done enough for you)

Your shirt is too tight,
Your chest is outlined,
You say "nevermind",
I'm shocked but not surprised

I've been broke,
I'll be broke again,
You would think I'd done enough for you,
(You would think I'd done enough for you),
You would think I'd done enough for you,
(You would think I'd done enough for you)

Na na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na

Your shirt is too tight,
Painted on off-white,
You think you're cool,
But it's my high school

I've been broke,
I'll be broke again,
You would think I'd done enough for you,
(You would think I'd done enough for you),
You would think I'd done enough for you,
(You would think I'd done enough for you)

Na na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na
