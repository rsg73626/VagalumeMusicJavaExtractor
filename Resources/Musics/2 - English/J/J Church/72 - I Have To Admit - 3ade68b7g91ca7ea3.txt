I HAVE TO ADMIT

I have to admit it is going to be hard,
It's already harder than I expected,
I woke up this morning next to nothing,
Arms holding nothing

I won't try to stop you,
I won't try to stop you,
And because I still want you,
I can't be friends with you

I won't show you all the times I've sat at home and cried,
I walked in the fog last night,
For the first time it didn't make me feel alright,
I won't try to stop you,
I won't try to stop you,
And because I still want you,
I can't be friends with you

I may keep the torch inside and try to be your friend,
I walked by your house hoping for an exorcism,
But I was proven wrong again and again

I won't try to stop you,
I won't try to stop you,
And because I still need you,
You are my best friend,
It's already harder than I had expected,
It's already harder than I had expected,
It's already harder than I had expected,
It's already harder than I had expected
