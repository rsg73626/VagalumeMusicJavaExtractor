CLOSING TIME IN AN EARLY TOWN

Every day she takes the bus downtown,
It's what she has to do,
To keep her mind steady,
She's always ready for something new,
Even though she may not want to go,
She lacks the ability to say "no",
She's absolutely confident,
That every word you tell her is total truth

The lights are going down,
It's late at night in an early town,
Save yourself, don't hang around,
Put your dreams in lost and found,
I know that you'll want to stay,
I know that you'll run away,
Your eyes are on the ground,
It's closing time in an early town

Steam may rise from beneath the street,
It has no scent at all,
Sorrow takes a 15 minute break,
And has a smoke out in the hall,
It's second-hand human misery,
Killing off almost everything,
You may be a killer of your friends,
But I know it's not your fault

The lights are going down,
It's late at night in an early town,
Save yourself, don't hang around,
Put your dreams in lost and found,
I know that you'll want to stay,
I know that you'll run away,
Your eyes are on the ground,
It's closing time in an early town

Your bus stop has a shelter from the rain,
But there's no room today,
The morning paper rotting in the gutter,
Is a corpse of paper mach√©,
The grey matter crumbles in the drink,
It doesn't make you feel like anything,
The suits all speak with safety,
But you don't hear what they say
