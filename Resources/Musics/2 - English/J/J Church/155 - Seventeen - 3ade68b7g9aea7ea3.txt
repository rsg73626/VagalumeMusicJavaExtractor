SEVENTEEN

Come and talk to me,
You know the call is free,
To me it feels like such a long, long time,
I saw the magazine,
You looked seventeen,
It makes me feel like thinking about you is a crime

The world that you live in is a million miles away,
Why not do tomorrow what you can do today,
There's coffee in the kitchen and bags for making tea,
Tea and toast for breakfast is good enough for me

When you think of me,
What do you see?
Maybe I'm just some distant memory,
I'm on the outside,
Beyond the bright lights,
I will think of you anonymously

The world that you live in is a million miles away,
Why not do tomorrow what you can do today,
There's coffee in the kitchen and bags for making tea,
Tea and toast for breakfast is good enough for me
