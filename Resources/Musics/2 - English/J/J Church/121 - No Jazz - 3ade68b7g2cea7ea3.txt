NO JAZZ

At close proximity, we fire mortar rounds of intellect,
Our spheres of influence are drowning in the subtext,
A spontaneity despite your education,
A new simplicity free from intimidation,
You are the specialist and I'm the antonym,
You don't need a PhD to see the state I'm in

No jazz, no jazz,
No jazz, no jazz tonight,
No jazz, no jazz,
No jazz, no jazz tonight

Better, better, better, you had better beware of accidental suicide,
Your formal musical education has become your Frankenstein,
Devices second-guess the impulse intuition,
Dazed and lost needlessly; it kills the secret mission
Disguised as some efficiency, they fought for the technology,
But even machines can't tolerate serving society

No jazz, no jazz,
No jazz, no jazz tonight,
No jazz, no jazz,
No jazz, no jazz tonight

And I just don't get it, thick as I am deep,
Living large in a little pond, the city's dead asleep,
Learning notes and parts and chords I've been thrust upon
Oh God, it's so very, not what I want

No jazz, no jazz,
No jazz, no jazz tonight,
No jazz, no jazz,
No jazz, no jazz tonight
