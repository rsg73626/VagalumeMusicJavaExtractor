SNOT RAGS

If I could live my life again,
There are so many things I'd want to change,
As if I could know...
I'd be destined to relive the pain again

She's got pictures on the wall,
Always manage to make me feel small,
I tell her that they keep her down,
As if it makes any sense at all

She can spill her mind into a jar,
It manifests itself on her bedroom floor,
Snot rags, books and tea bags,
I say that I'm just running to the store

She's past caring for herself,
She's frustrated when she forgets,
She's scared whenever she gets lost,
Sometimes she forgets herself

Sometimes she forgets herself,
Sometimes she forgets herself,
Sometimes she forgets herself,
Sometimes she forgets herself
