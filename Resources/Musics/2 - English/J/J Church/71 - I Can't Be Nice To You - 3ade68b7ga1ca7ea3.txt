I CAN'T BE NICE TO YOU

I won't write you a letter,
I won't call you on the phone,
I won't fax you at your office,
Still you won't leave me alone

I can't be nice to you,
I can't be nice to you,
I can't be nice to you,
Be nice to you, be nice to you, be nice to you

I have to laugh when you ask me,
With all seriousness about the 'scene',
And I don't care what you write,
And I don't care what you say,
In your useless magazine

I can't be nice to you,
I can't be nice to you,
I can't be nice to you,
Be nice to you, be nice to you, be nice to you
