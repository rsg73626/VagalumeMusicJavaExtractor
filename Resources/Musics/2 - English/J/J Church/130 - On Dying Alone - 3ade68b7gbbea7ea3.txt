ON DYING ALONE

I'm shaping shy shame into words,
I'm tongue tied, left mouth dried and absurd,
I know I can't drink it away

You couldn't have been anyone,
If I could choose from anyone...,
I'm painting lime in shades of gray

If I believed then I would pray that things would always stay the same,
I know we're changing every day,
I'm still afraid of dying alone,
Is it absurd? I just don't know,
My luck says I'll end up that way
