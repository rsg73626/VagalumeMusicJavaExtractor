NOW YOU REALIZE

Now you realize that she's never coming back,
You finally come to terms with that very simple fact,
Now you've reached the point where you can think of her,
Without any anger or without wanting to cry

Tonight for dinner,
You eat in the kitchen,
You feel like nothing's missing,
With the help of the television
