CITY BY THE BAY

Trivial anger is our fetishized notion,
We're a quick bus ride from the ocean,
The city's cynicism manifests itself in greed,
Every bus stop lies down in defeat

Everyone's running away to the city by the bay,
If you can't make it here you might as well jump off the Golden Gate,
Everyone's running away to the city by the bay,
If you can't make it here you might as well jump off the Golden Gate

Contrived pregnant pauses punctuate your conversation,
Condescending, yet again, in all of your relations,
I have to admit that I have dreams where I'm as bold as you,
But I'm sure to you it's nothing new

Everyone's running away to the city by the bay,
If you can't make it here you might as well jump off the Golden Gate,
Everyone's running away to the city by the bay,
If you can't make it here you might as well jump off the Golden Gate

Look across the hills and architectural lies,
Culture and confusion are more than a disguise,
They're looking down at you and everything you do,
If the big one hit tomorrow it wouldn't be too soon,

Everyone's running away to the city by the bay,
If you can't make it here you might as well jump off the Golden Gate,
Everyone's running away to the city by the bay,
If you can't make it here you might as well jump off the Golden Gate
