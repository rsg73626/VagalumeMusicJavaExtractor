CHEMICALS

She’s coming over,
I can smell the chemicals from here,
I just had to get away,
And my resistance,
Is I don’t need it to exist,
I should just give it away

Dry your eyes, your true deceit is known,
These things you call yourself are really things that you own,
Dry your eyes, your true deceit is known,
These things you call yourself are really parts of the whole

And I should have known not to let you into my house,
Into my house, my house, my house, my house,
And I should have known not to let you into my house,
Into my house, my house, my house, my house

She’s got her bag open,
A gift from a special friend,
He works the nightshift every day,
And every moment, every second,
Every minute I hesitate,
I should just give it away

Dry your eyes, your true deceit is known,
These things you call yourself are really things that you own,
Dry your eyes, your true deceit is known,
These things you call yourself are really parts of the whole

And I should have known not to let you into my house,
Into my house, my house, my house, my house,
And I should have known not to let you into my house,
Into my house, my house, my house, my house
