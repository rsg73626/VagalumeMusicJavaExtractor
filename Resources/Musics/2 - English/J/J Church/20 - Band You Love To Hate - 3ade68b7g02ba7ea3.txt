BAND YOU LOVE TO HATE

Backstage passes for the both of you,
Again, what does it mean to you,
You think you're writing wrongs with your old typewriter,
But you haven't got a clue,
Six weeks in and I wish I was out,
I'm missing my amenities,
In a foreign land doing all I can,
Calling home is a luxury

We can be the band you love to hate,
I think it's great,
We demand nothing less,
I'll revel in the pain,
We're the lesser of two evils,
Of which there is no divorce

Red eye to lobby,
Coach to sound check,
Home by the fourth,
Flying to Geneva staring at disgusting airline food,
That was paid for by a third source,
I can think about it,
I can analyze it,
I can find my dollar value,
You know I wouldn't do it if I didn't want to do it,
But I'm made my own mistakes too

We can be the band you love to hate,
I think it's great,
We demand nothing less,
I'll revel in the pain,
We're the lesser of two evils,
Of which there is no divorce
