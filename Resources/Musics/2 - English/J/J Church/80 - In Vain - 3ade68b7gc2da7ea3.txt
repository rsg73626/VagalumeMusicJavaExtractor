IN VAIN

Carolina and Nicole are two of the best of friends,
Walking home at 7:30 past five drunk Hispanic men,
No sense even in listening when you've heard it all before,
There's no sense in convincing when to them you’re always the white whore

She said, "It wasn't all in vain",
She said "It helped me get in touch with my pain",
She doesn't mean the things she says,
She once told me she wished that she was dead

Talking about old Motown records,
Walking home at night,
Carolina and Nicole are not about to give up without a fight,
Not about to admit feeling so alone,
"Have you ever had a real man baby?
Can I walk you home?"

She said, "It wasn't all in vain",
She said "It helped me get in touch with my pain",
She doesn’t mean the things she says,
She once told me she wished that she was dead

And you think that I’m bad because I don’t finish all that I started,
But for you the last Hüsker Dü must have seemed something cathartic,
I don't feel that I can know you any more,
Crazy Jane changed her name,
Crazy Jane changed her name
