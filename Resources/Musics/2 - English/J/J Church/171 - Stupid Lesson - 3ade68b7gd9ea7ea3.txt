STUPID LESSON

Another stupid lesson I didnâ€™t want to learn,
Standing in the rain waiting for my turn,
It's my human condition that makes my world complete,
But tonight I just want to go home,
And a chance to dry my feet

No-one gets a second chance,
No-one knows the reason to the rhyme,
It might not make a difference,
No-one knows or has that kind of time

Your condescending tone has kept me up at night,
I didn't say a word and I'm left with hindsight,
Your eyes look right through me,
While mine look through the rag,
I don't want your cause and I won't wave your flag

No-one gets a second chance,
No-one knows the reason to the rhyme,
It might not make a difference,
No-one knows or has that kind of time

I didn't want to say this but now I know it's true,
Inspiration turns to dogma and I wipe it off my shoe,
It's my human condition that makes my world complete,
But tonight I just want to go home,
And a chance to dry my feet

No-one gets a second chance,
No-one knows the reason to the rhyme,
It might not make a difference,
No-one knows or has that kind of time
