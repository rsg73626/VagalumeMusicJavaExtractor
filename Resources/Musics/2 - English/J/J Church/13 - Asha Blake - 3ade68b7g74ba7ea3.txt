ASHA BLAKE

I never sleep, which is no surprise,
And I don't need to justify why I like to see the sunrise

A voice is very close to me,
It happened quite unconsciously,
Now I watch the news religiously

Something about the hair,
Something about the far-off stare,
Makes me think of underwear

In the morning I'm awake,
And I'm watching Asha Blake,
I can't say my life is all mistakes
