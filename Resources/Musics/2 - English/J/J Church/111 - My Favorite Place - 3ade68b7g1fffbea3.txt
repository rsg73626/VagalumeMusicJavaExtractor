MY FAVORITE PLACE

Floyd calls me on the phone,
And I usually don't mind if he won't leave me alone,
But today has been a busy day if there is such a thing anyway,
My cats look bored,
They're hunting down flies on the kitchen floor,
The neighborhood isn't my favourite place any more
Maybe if I cut my hair,
I can fall into a new undiscovered despair,
I haven't got anything clean today to wear

One plus one - my cats look bored,
Two plus two - the kitchen floor,
Three plus three - my favourite place,
Four plus four - not any more

I've been gone for two months,
I'm out of touch, out of time, out of everyone,
Now I know that a weekend in Manilla is not much fun
Now I'm back at home,
But I can't remember when I last felt so alone,
Misery calls every minute on the telephone

One plus one - been gone two months,
Two plus two - I'm out of touch,
Three plus three - my VJ's gone,
Four plus four - not very fun

I may be home,
But if you'd please leave your message at the sound of the tone,
Excuse me for my fear of the telephone
My house, my tomb,
I can't even write a song about sitting in my room,
There's no room to sit, I just wait in apprehensive gloom

One plus one - I may be home,
Two plus two - the sound, the tone,
Three plus three - excuse my fear,
Four plus four - the telephone

One plus one - I may be home,
Two plus two - the sound, the tone,
Three plus three - excuse my fear,
Four plus four, four, four

One plus one - I may be home,
Two plus two - the sound, the tone,
Three plus three - excuse my fear,
Four plus four - the telephone
