LAST OF THE FAMOUS INTERNATIONAL

Dear hero imprisoned,
With all the new crimes that you are perfecting,
Well I can't help quoting you,
Because everything that you said rings true

And now in my cell,
(Well, I followed you),
And here's a list of who I slew,
Reggie Kray - do you know my name?
Well, say you don't,
Please say you do, whoa-oh

I am the last of the famous international playboys,
The last of the famous international playboys

And now in my cell,
(Well, I loved you),
Every man with a job to do,
Ronnie Kray - do you know my face?
Oh, don't say you don't,
Please say you do, whoa-oh

I am the last of the famous international playboys,
The last of the famous international playboys

In our lifetime those who kill,
The newsworld hands them stardom,
And these are the ways on which I was raised,
These are the ways on which I was raised,
But I never wanted to kill,
I'm not naturally evil,
Such things I do,
Just to make myself more attractive to you,
Have I failed? 

No, no, yeah, no, yeah,
No, no, yeah, no, yeah

I am the last of the famous international playboys,
The last of the famous international playboys
