THIRTY SECOND SONG

Thirty second song still sounds too long,
When everything I say seems to come out wrong,
Nobody wants to know,
They all just want to sing along

Thirty second song still sounds too long,
When everything I say seems to come out wrong,
Nobody wants to know,
They all just want to sing along

So la la la la,
La la la la,
La la la la,
La la la la,
La la la la,
La la la la,
La la la la,
La la la la
