SWEET AND SOUR PLUMS

Another bag of sweet and sour plums,
It's like clockwork at this time of year,
A little gift and hopefully a memory,
But I know it isn’t working

It's your home,
It's not mine,
You can keep your sweet sunshine,
It's your home,
It's not mine,
You can keep your sweet sunshine

More coffee from Hawaii,
I don't know if I should be laughing,
A little gift and hopefully a memory,
I know that I’m not moving

It's your home,
It's not mine,
You can keep your sweet sunshine,
It's your home,
It's not mine,
You can keep your sweet sunshine
