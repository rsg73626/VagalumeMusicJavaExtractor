GULF BREEZE, FLORIDA

Let's get your car and go,
There's nothing new in New Mexico,
And I feel it in my bones,
Time stops on the Gulf Coast

Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida

It's in the night sky,
It's unidentified,
It's real. It's recorded. It's refined,
It's hypothetically classified,

Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida

It's our vacation,
Across the nation,
The FBI may tap our phones,
But we love to speak in code

Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida

It's in the night sky

Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida,
Gulf Breeze, Florida
