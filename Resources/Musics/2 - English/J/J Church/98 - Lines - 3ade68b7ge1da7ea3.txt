LINES

You told me that you hated lines,
Hate being told what to do,
You can bitch and you can whine,
But whose idea was the cue?

And I know it's just my opinion,
The lines are in my mind,
They lead me to my indecision,
So what are you gonna do,
When the same applies to you?

She told me that she doesn't care,
Doesn't matter if he dies,
She told me that I'm unaware,
Words are just a waste of time?

And I know it's just my opinion,
The lines are in my mind,
They lead me to my indecision,
So what are you gonna do,
When the same applies to you?

You told me that you hated lines,
Hate being told what to do,
You can bitch and you can whine,
But whose idea was the cue?

And I know it's just my opinion,
The lines are in my mind,
They lead me to my indecision,
So what are you gonna do,
When the same goes for you?
