MARY'S MOVING OUT

Mary's moving out today, I can't say that I blame her,
How could she survive in the house of ageing and self-loathing?
Mary's moving out today and Chuck is gonna help her,
It's not as if I won't see either of them again

Just another in a series,
In a series of disgruntled room-mates

I come home,
I watch my videos and television,
I sit here and disappear in a headmaster raphsody,
I go down to Rainbow and buy nothing for no-one,
Killing time deadens minds,
Good times seem so far behind

Just another in a series,
In a series of disgruntled room-mates
