NOSTALGIC FOR NOTHING

What's left behind...,
A room that is big and undefined,
A dying light,
I lie awake alone at night,
And I don't care,
I know that life cannot be fair,
I know that life cannot be fair

I feel nostalgic for nothing,
I am the pawn,
I am the king

This is it,
Can't you feel the Santa Ana winds,
I catch the breeze,
The smell of Eucalyptus trees,
I'll begin,
Can't you feel the Santa Ana winds,
Can't you feel the Santa Ana winds

I feel nostalgic for nothing,
I am the pawn,
I am the king

I feel nostalgic for nothing,
I am the pawn,
I am the king,
I feel nostalgic for nothing,
I am the pawn,
I am the king
