IF I'M LONELY

I'm sick of the television,
Nothing is on,
It doesn't mean indecision,
I'm sick of my stereo,
I'm sick of my CDs,
I wish someone would throw them all away

If I see you then I would know it's true,
If I'm lonely then it's only because I've got nothing better to do

So I finally found a radio station,
Playing the songs I would have played,
It didn't last long until I realized it was nothing new,
Nothing new

If I see you then I would know it's true,
If I'm lonely then it's only because I've got nothing better to do,
If I see you then I would know it's true,
If I'm lonely then it's only because I've got nothing better to do
