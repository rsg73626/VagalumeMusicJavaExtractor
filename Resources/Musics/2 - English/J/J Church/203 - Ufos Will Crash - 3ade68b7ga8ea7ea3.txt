UFOS WILL CRASH

You don’t have to justify yourself,
And I don’t need to know the truth myself,
UFOs will crash,
So don’t expect your world to last,
You don’t have to justify yourself

Any of your meanings have cheapened any feelings, 
That I have for all your actions, 
So shut your mouth

I don’t need to know the truth myself,
UFOs will crash,
So don’t expect your world to last,
You don’t have to justify yourself

Any of your reasons have cheapened any feelings, 
That I have for all your actions, 
So shut your mouth
