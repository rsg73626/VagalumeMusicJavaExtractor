COLONEL HONG KONG

Prince Charles and his troops sail away today,
No flags and no colony

4,000 Chinese troops waiting at the border,
They'll carry out the order

Peter Jennings is coming live,
Live on my TV,
I'm feeling moved though I don't wanna be,
Though I don't wanna be,
It's not a metaphor,
It's not anything,
I need to understand my own Peking spring
