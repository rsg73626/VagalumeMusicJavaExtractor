LIMP

Everything gives me cancer,
Every day the process is getting faster,
And when I stop to wonder why,
I think about Altadena skies,
Altadena skies

While I don't feel that I’m to blame,
I don't feel that I want the world to stay the same,
And if you think your life is grand,
I've got news for you my friend,
There’s more to life than staying content

Everything gives me an ulcer,
One says ghetto,
One says culture,
Everything has its place,
They saved me a spot right here in the waist,
Right here in the waist

While I don’t feel that I'm to blame,
I don't feel that I want the world to stay the same,
And if you think your life is grand,
I've got news for you my friend,
There’s more to life than staying content

My lungs are daily filled with Mission Street,
The smell of exhaust and visions of defeat,
I took three showers today,
But the smell wouldn't go away,
So I turned on the radio and drifted away,
I drifted away to a better place,
Drifted away to a better place

While I don't feel that I’m to blame,
I don't feel that I want the world to stay the same,
And if you think your life is grand,
I've got news for you my friend,
There's more to life than staying content, content, content
