NEVER HAPPY

She is never happy with the weather,
I don't know why I try to understand,
She acts as if it's always getting better,
And dresses in accordance with her plan,
She always ends up soaking with the shivers,
She looks at me with nothing in her eyes,
She says "Why did you let me go out in this weather?"
For some reason I apologize

She sticks out her thumb like she's going somewhere,
One eye watching what I'm gonna do,
I try real hard to act as if I really don't care,
But she knows me better than I want her to,
She knows me better than I want her to

She always wants to go out for dinner,
But the service is never good enough,
She says she doesn't tip for a beginner,
I pay because I thought it was a bluff,
She tells me that I'm stupid with my money,
She tells me that she doesn't like my friends,
She tells me that she doesn't think I'm funny,
And I make her want to be a lesbian

She sticks out her thumb like she's going somewhere,
One eye watching what I'm gonna do,
I try real hard to act as if I really don't care,
But she knows me better than I want her to,
She knows me better than I want her to

She tells me that she wants to see Godzilla,
Just because she knows that I don't wanna go,
I know she doesn't wanna see it either,
She's mad at me because I tell her so,
Her face is so filled with frustration,
I suddenly begin to lose my mind,
I start to laugh about the situation,
This must be the place I've tried to find

She sticks out her thumb like she's going somewhere,
One eye watching what I'm gonna do,
I try real hard to act as if I really don't care,
But she knows me better than I want her to,
She knows me better than I want her to
