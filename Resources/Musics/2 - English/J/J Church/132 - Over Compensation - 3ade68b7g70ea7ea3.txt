OVER COMPENSATION

What the hell is she trying to prove,
She can claim it's unintentional,
What the hell is she trying to prove,
She's on television all the motherfuckin' time

She thinks it's just a game,
It's all show and tell,
She thinks it's just a game,
It's all show and tell

She feels she's got something to prove,
It's overcompensation,
Overripe sensation,
One foot on the back of a slave,
One foot firm in the grave

She thinks it's just a game,
It's all show and tell,
She thinks it's just a game,
It's all show and tell

One foot on the back of a slave,
One foot firm in the grave,
One foot on the back of a slave,
One foot firm in the grave
