SANTA CRUZ

I know that it’s not cool to cruise the boardwalk in Santa Cruz,
But we had nothing better to do on a boring afternoon,
No level of sophistication could prepare me for the situation,
Now I know you don’t like carnival rides,
And I know you don’t like me

Let me savor every moment,
Feel the flush warm through my pores,
Let me savor every moment,
Feel the flush warm through my pores,
Crushed by your every comment
This conversation is in your court

Did I tell you that I hate your new hair,
And I’m bored to death by your stupid poetry,
And I hate the way that you take up the whole bed,
And other things you did inadvertently,
The romantic notion of a secret place is now blowing up in my face,
I’ll dream of you with someone new,
But if you ever want me back... no

Let me savor every moment,
Feel the flush warm through my pores,
Let me savor every moment,
Feel the flush warm through my pores,
Crushed by your every comment,
This conversation is in your court

Leaving you took a few books of mine,
A few kitchen utensils which was fine,
But when you kept all of my friends,
Well it seems you should have asked,
Alone in the studio I wait for you to come home,
Until I realize,
I’m just pretending that love’s never ending,
Now I know that everything dies
