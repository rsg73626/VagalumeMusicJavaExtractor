FAVORITE PHRASE

Everything moves so fast,
Now where was it I saw you last?
It must have been [...?] or at the show,
You looked at me with sad, sad eyes,
And it always takes me by surprise,
You're asking me things I just don't know
Well I wanna go back today,
[...?] chocolate cake,
I've asked but you don't wanna seem to go

Now it seems so long ago,
My favorite phrase nowadays seems to be,
"I don't know",
Four useless words in a mask I wear,
But at least it's a step above "I don't care",
I don't care

I don't want to sing that song again,
'Cause I wrote it for another friend,
But it turned into a love song for you,
I'd rather write about L.A.,
So I don't forget how I felt today,
I thought my mind and heart would be untrue,
We both fucked up, we both could change,
It's funny how we stay the same,
Let's sit around, there's nothing here to do

Now it seems so long ago,
My favorite phrase nowadays seems to be,
"I don't know",
Four useless words in a mask I wear,
But at least it's a step above "I don't care",
I don't care, I don't care

It's so dumb, it's not worth repeating,
You're telling me that you're leaving,
I should have guessed there was something wrong,
[...?] crashed and stayed 'til dawn,
And then I feel the hem of your dress,
And the warmth of your breath on the back of my neck,
So come to bed, turn out the light,
And let's fuck just one last time

Just one last time, just one last time,
Just one last time,
This last time, just one last time,
This last time, this last time,
Just one last time
