KILL YOUR BOSS

Butterfly against the blue,
Destination unclear,
You are trapped here in my room,
We can share despair

Fluorescent lights define the mood,
Calculated pigmentation,
Hate myself for hating you,
Blame it on my job frustration

Tonight I'm going to kill my boss,
I don't think it's so outrageous,
Every wage has got its cost,
And I hope that it's contagious,
Tonight I'm going to kill my boss,
I don't think it's so outrageous,
Every wage has got its cost,
And I hope that it's contagious

Fluorescent lights define the mood,
Calculated pigmentation,
Hate myself for hating you,
Blame it on my job frustration

We'll find his address in the company files,
Drive out to Marin,
Burn him and his Nagles too,
We'll collect unemployment on Monday again

Tonight I'm going to kill my boss,
I don't think it's so outrageous,
Every wage has got its cost,
And I hope that it's contagious,
Now I'm going to kill my boss,
I don't think it's so outrageous,
Every wage has got its cost,
And I hope that it's contagious
