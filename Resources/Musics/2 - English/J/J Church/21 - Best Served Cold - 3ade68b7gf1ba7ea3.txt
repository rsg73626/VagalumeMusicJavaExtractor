BEST SERVED COLD

Roads and roads of countryside,
With someone left behind,
I get another letter,
It's meant to remind,
"Every day you seem to change",
You don't know what you're saying,
"Every day you seem to change",
You can't begin to imagine

Every word never published,
I would read if you would let me,
Plays, stories and articles,
Miles of horrible poetry,
I'll commit it to memory,
Every word in my memory,
Can't you recognize our mirrored failure,
I'll commit it to memory
