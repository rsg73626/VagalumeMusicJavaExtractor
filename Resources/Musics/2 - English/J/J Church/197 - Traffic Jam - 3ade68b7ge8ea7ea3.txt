TRAFFIC JAM

Woke up in the morning,
Aggravation A.M.,
Last night's entertainment came to a toxic end,
My body takes the poison,
My mind prescribes the dose,
My personal lie wasn't even close

My days turn into cars,
In a psychic traffic jam,
Situations and destinations are all part of the plan,
My earliest potential never had a chance,
Dance you fools,
Close your eyes and dance

Cut the sound and kill the lights,
The audience are late,
"Sorry" was the only note they gave
