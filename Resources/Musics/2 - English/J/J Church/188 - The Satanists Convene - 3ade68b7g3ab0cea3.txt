THE SATANISTS CONVENE

Nothing is the same anymore,
The Satanists convene on the shore,
Their creatures disappeared from the sea,
The gateway vanished into eternity

The Church Of Satan went back underground,
LaVey’s magic organ makes no sound, downtown,
Susan Atkins is nowhere to be found,
Banality now keeps the city wound

The Camera Obscura is gone,
The Church of John Coltrane is gone,
The Mechanical Museum is gone,
Half of all my friends are long gone

I don’t resent the city or the shore,
I feel myself feeling kinda bored,
I wake up just like I did before,
Sleep is no relief any more
