MARGE SCHOTT

All the faces are dressed up in blue,
And there's not a lot I can do,
Conspiracy, 1973,
At the age of 32,
All the dreams I had, all the visions that I had up until then,
Turned into dust and the anonymity that comes with them

Inside there is silver and gold,
Marge Schott can't get in there,
Superman can't survive the Dragon's stare

Your colors and flags on a screen,
Turn into something obscene,
The hero died less than dignified,
At the hands of the all-white machine,
Every dream I had, every vision that I had up until then,
Vanished into stars and the anonymity that comes with them

Inside there is silver and gold,
Marge Schott can't get in there,
Superman can't survive the Dragon's stare

All of what I heard from the ads in the magazines and the T.V.,
Create a new image that I have to take personally

Inside there is silver and gold,
Marge Schott can't get in there,
Superman can't survive the Dragon's stare
