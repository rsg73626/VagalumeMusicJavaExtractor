ALONE WHEN SHE DIES

If I could have any expectation,
And looked back a generation,
What would be the case?
My Grandmother died with the mind of a child,
All she did was smile and couldn’t recognize my face

It’s sad but nothing more,
I didn’t feel better than the time I did before,
And in my head the feeling is coming,
Coming closer,
Closer all the time,
Stronger though sublime

Now feel the rain wash away the sin and guilt,
What’s left?
My window pane...,
I write her name in the steam from my breath

My Grandmother on my mom’s side was alone when she died,
With her family that moved away,
Who’s to say my mom’s not the same?
Living across the USA,
Getting old and gray

It’s sad but nothing more,
I didn’t feel better than the time I did before,
And in my head the feeling is coming,
Coming closer,
Closer all the time,
Stronger though sublime

Now feel the rain wash away the sin and guilt,
What’s left? 
My window pane...,
I write her name in the steam from my breath
