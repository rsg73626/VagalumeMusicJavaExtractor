LEMON ZINGER

I've had a hunch, I've had a hunch for a month,
And I've tried to let my logic transcend,
Maybe just a hunch and alone it's not enough,
But I doubt you'll ever kiss me back again

You can drink your Women's LiberTea,
I'm not here nor there obviously,
My lemon zinger goes cold in front of me,
Lie to me if you need

We've waited too long, even the cats know it's wrong,
And they're working hard to calm down our nerves,
And I'm sleeping with the lie, wishing I could die,
I'm a fool and I get what I deserve

You can drink your Women's LiberTea,
I'm not here nor there obviously,
My lemon zinger goes cold in front of me,
Lie to me if you need

My stupid scary dreams I've denied since my teens,
Laugh at me, laugh at me, laugh at me,
That's OK, we can't all win anyway,
And I don't mind if you look right through me

You can drink your Women's LiberTea,
I'm not here nor there obviously,
My lemon zinger goes cold in front of me,
Lie to me if you need
