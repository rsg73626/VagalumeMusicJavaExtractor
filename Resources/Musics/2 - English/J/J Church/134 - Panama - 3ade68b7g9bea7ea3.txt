PANAMA

The Captain is crying at the helm,
While the crew sits and laughs, 
His daughter is staring at the moon,
It's over at last

The passengers don't say a word,
Old folks act like they hadn't heard,
Newlyweds in grey drink to the past

For a man, a plan, a canal, Panama,
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama,
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama

Did you ever think that Cripple Creek,
Could be still at night?
A million broken stereos are stars in the sky,
The one thing I will always hear,
Is the constant ringing thatâ€™s in my ears,
It reminds me of the stars in your eyes

For a man, a plan, a canal, Panama,
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama,
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama

She was barely giving signs,
He was barely there on time,
Please, I need something stronger than this wine

For a man, a plan, a canal, Panama,
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama,
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
