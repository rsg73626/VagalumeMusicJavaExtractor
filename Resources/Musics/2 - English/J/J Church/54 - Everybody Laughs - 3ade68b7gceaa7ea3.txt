EVERYBODY LAUGHS

Every face was different,
It was the same blood still on every page,
In the caption was written:
"The bank after a visit from the R.Z." 

Three dead in a cell,
Stammheim in his lonely cell,
Walls never fell,
Stammheim and his lonely hell

Everybody laughs,
Stupid words for stupid ears,
Useless songs and useless rhymes take your time

Why behave? There's plenty more where you came from anyway,
Plastic devices for all,
You and I can make this city fall

Everybody laughs,
Stupid words for stupid ears,
Useless songs and useless rhymes take your time
