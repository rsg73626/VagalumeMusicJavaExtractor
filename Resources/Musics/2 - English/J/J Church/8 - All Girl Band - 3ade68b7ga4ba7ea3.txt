ALL GIRL BAND

I never meant to simplify or even understand,
I was in the back row,
Just trying to watch the band,
Oblivious to currents in performance and opinion,
I guess we all thought they would be proud of the distinction

Maybe I was a pathetic fan,
You don't care and I can live with that,
I just wanted you to understand,
They can never taint you in my eyes,
Maybe I was a pathetic fan,
You don't care and I can live with that,
I just wanted you to understand,
They can never taint you in my eyes

Everything and anything is sometimes in the plan,
They're trying very hard not to understand,
Ulterior motives can go unrealized,
It's a novelty on-stage for them to fetishize

Maybe I was a pathetic fan,
You don't care and I can live with that,
I just wanted you to understand,
They can never taint you in my eyes,
Maybe I was a pathetic fan,
You don't care and I can live with that,
I just wanted you to understand,
They can never taint you in my eyes
