DISPOSED TO FEMININITY

You are part of a trinity,
Disposed to femininity,
In some ways disposed to insanity,
Defying logic in sanity,
Cold as the rain above,
A superseding love,
Like a hand in glove,
A superficial love

Inside the plastic case,
Outlined in barcode,
Your voice compressed and equalized,
A superficial love,
I'll never see your face,
Behind compact and complex,
In the music magazine,
You ear industry

And I thought that I could see through,
But there was nothing to look in to,
You are on the television, television, television,
You assist in my decision, my decision, my decision

I read the books that you suggested,
At first I thought that it was insensitive,
An exercise, some exercise in creative writing,
I thought the content was sickly exciting

And I thought that I could see through,
But there was nothing to look in to,
You are on the television, television, television,
You assist in my decision, my decision, my decision
