TRICKY

This is not a good sign,
You say you're losing your mind,
People say it's no exaggeration,
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did?
Or was it something from a gray spot in your head?

I want a cheese and mushroom omelet,
I want a microwave oven,
I want to leave a tip after every meal,
Does that make me a bad person?

What's behind the smile?
What's behind the eyes?
Something sorry if anything at all,
The counter is sticky,
This all seems tricky,
To get out of a bogus situation

I want to stay up all night,
I want to sleep with the light,
I want those dishes to be out of here,
Does that make me imperfect?
