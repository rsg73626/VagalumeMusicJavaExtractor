SIMPLE GESTURE

No domination,
Just exploitation,
You don't need total control,
When you use us all

I'm waking up in the noontime sun,
The late night show is not for everyone

A simple gesture molds the future,
No creation,
Missing passions

Got caught in the rain again late last night,
Couldn't get to sleep so I took the time to write,
Two A.M., let's see what's on TV,
Nothing stopping you and nothing stopping me

And I'm waking up in the noontime sun,
And the late night show is not for everyone

When you read the signs,
You may change your mind,
Your situation may read extinction

I've had three apartments since I last saw you,
I kept your letters,
Your hate mail, I kept too

I can't drive a car,
Or play guitar,
But I'm moving fast and that's a gas

I saw hail for the first time late last night,
All I can say is I'm glad I was inside,
I re-read your letters so I could feel sad,
For the first time they didn't make me think of times we had

And I'm waking up in the noontime sun,
And the late night show is not for everyone

Got caught in the rain again late last night,
Couldn't get to sleep so I took the time to write,
Two A.M., let's see what's on TV,
Nothing stopping you and nothing stopping me
