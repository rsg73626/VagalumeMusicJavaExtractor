NOTHING CITY

We're burning down your galleries,
You know that galleries only breed disease,
Teachers teach the wrong history,
You know that classrooms only breed disease

We've got no history,
This is the nothing city,
Are you surprised there is nothing to see,
It permeates the air we breathe

We've got no history (la la la la la),
This is the nothing city, nothing city, nothing city,
We've got no history (la la la la la),
This is the nothing city, nothing city, nothing city

We've all got one big secret,
We all hate everything,
Everything is such a joke,
And believe you me I know

I am the nothing man,
My hatred goes on-line,
I'm looking everywhere,
My scream is just a whine

We've got no history (la la la la la),
This is the nothing city, nothing city, nothing city,
We've got no history (la la la la la),
This is the nothing city, nothing city, nothing city
