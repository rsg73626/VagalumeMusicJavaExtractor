FASCIST RADIO

Here is my contribution,
To your fascist radio, fascist radio show,
Here is my one solution,
Smash your radio receiver on the floor

You say you have all the answers,
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

We have expectations,
That you won't like any or all of these songs,
All of my friends are waiting,
They are waiting for me to do something wrong

You say you have all the answers,
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

You say you have all the answers,
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
