LOST IN A SILENT STARE

I feel like a pogue or just a step below,
No alcohol in this examination,
Am I eating or just repeating?
The essence lost in a bad translation

I'm not here,
I'm not there,
I won't say a word about your history,
These classifications are just fascinations,
Your choices are just further luxuries

Tokyo don't pretend to know,
Don't pretend to be lost in a silent stare,
Tokyo is it all for show?
Show me now that you really care,
Tokyo!

I have no right, no right at all,
To hide behind any confrontation,
Superfluous criticism,
Lightly veiled racism,
Are outsiders acts of desperation

Now dig your heels and capture the feel
Of on riding that rush hour train,
Dead on your feet, it's still a treat,
I'll suck it dry again and again

Tokyo don't pretend to know,
Don't pretend to be lost in a silent stare,
Tokyo is it all for show?
Show me now that you really care,
Tokyo!

I feel like a pogue or just a step below,
No alcohol in this examination,
Am I eating or just repeating?
The essence lost in a bad translation

Tokyo don't pretend to know,
Don't pretend to be lost in a silent stare,
Tokyo is it all for show?
Show me now that you really care,
Tokyo!
