KILL SURF CITY

I love my baby and she loves me,
I lost my baby to the deep blue sea,
Gonna take my trigger, blow your head,
Gonna shoot 'til you all are dead

Gonna kill surf city with a loaded gun,
Gonna hit surf city like a nuclear bomb,
Gonna fuck surf city, gonna get it down,
Kill, kill, kill it now,
Gonna kill surf city

I hate her and she hates me,
That's the way it's supposed to be,
Gonna want to wanna hit the sun,
See you cunts, I'm gonna get my gun

Gonna kill surf city with a loaded gun,
Gmnna hit surf city like a nuclear bomb,
Gonna fuck surf city, gonna get it down,
Kill, kill, kill it now,
Gonna kill surf city

Gonna kill surf city with a loaded gun,
Gonna hit surf city like a nuclear bomb,
Gonna fuck surf city, gonna get it down,
Kill, kill, kill it now,
Gonna kill surf city
