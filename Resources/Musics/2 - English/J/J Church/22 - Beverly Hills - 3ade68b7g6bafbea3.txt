BEVERLY HILLS

Beverly Hills, Century City,
Everything's so nice and pretty
All the people look the same,
Don't they know they're fucking lame?

Here she comes in her stupid suit,
Leather pants and her combat boots
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
All I know is that Iâ€™m glad I moved from...

Beverly Hills, Century City,
Everything's so nice and pretty
All the people, they look the same,
Don't they know they're fucking lame?

Here he comes in his stupid suit,
His [...?] shirt and his combat boots,
[...?]
Cos the atmosphere down in Beverly Hills...

Beverly Hills, Century City!
