I WILL SAVOR THIS

I feel dirty with the clothes I have on,
I feel dirty on the Reeperbahn,
I'm walking through,
I walk away,
Time to lose on the motorway (motorway) 

An affection that I don't understand,
You're looking like a lost gringo, man (understand),
The board is burning hot tonight,
And I walk straight into the light

The meaning's melded in a blur of speed,
I forget to take the time to breathe,
If this connection never happens again,
I will savor this until the end (until the end)

The new is nothing, the new is shitty,
Architects vomit on this city,
The Haffenstra√ü is a world away,
A step ahead of the sex decay
