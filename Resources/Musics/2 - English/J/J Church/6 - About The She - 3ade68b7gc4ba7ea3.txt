ABOUT THE SHE

My room with girls on the TV,
They cry, I don't know what it means,
I know that I'm too far away,
I know that I'm too far away,
I know that I'm too far away,
I know that I'm too far away

Another song about the she,
The one who doesn't live with me,
I wish that I was home to stay,
I wish that I was home to stay,
I wish that I was home to stay,
I wish that I was home to stay
