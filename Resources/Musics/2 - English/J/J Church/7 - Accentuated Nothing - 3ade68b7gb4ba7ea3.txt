ACCENTUATED NOTHING

Everybody has a question,
If not an adoring letter,
If not words of disappointment,
I'm being blackmailed with integrity,
I read every word,
I cannot respond,
Letters come from every land,
I’ve got nowhere to run,
I watch my words,
Feel like I'm walking on eggshells,
Every other word could be a case against me

I'm not anybody,
An accentuated nothing,
Your bribes and accusations,
Are a daily reminder

Living in the suburbs,
Says my words changed her life,
I don’t think I’m up for that responsibility,
When she’s disappointed,
I wish I was not alive,
I guess it’s all my fault inadvertently

I have such regret,
On the last years of my life,
The thought of reliving any chapters,
Is a new level of disappointment

I'm not anybody,
An accentuated nothing,
Your bribes and accusations,
Are a daily reminder
