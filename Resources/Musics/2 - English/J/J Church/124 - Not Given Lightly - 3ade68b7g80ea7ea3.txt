NOT GIVEN LIGHTLY

Hello my friend,
It’s morning, time to wake up,
Your body and mine,
Entwined will have to break now,
But I want your flesh, your warmth to stay beside me,
Oh how I wish you could be deep inside me

Show me your eyes,
Your love, most tender feelings,
And I'll give you mine,
Be truthful and revealing

It's you that I love and it's true that I love,
And it's love not given lightly,
And I knew this was love and it's you that I love,
And it's more than what it might be

When we're alone,
I cannot always face you,
Maybe my moon,
Won't let these arms embrace you,
That doesn't mean my love’s somehow diminished,
Give me the time to show what love's finished

It's you that I love and it's true that I love,
And it's love not given lightly,
And I knew this was love and it's you that I love,
And it's more than what it might be

I need your body,
Your mind and your emotions,
Shed me your tears,
'Til I drown in your oceans,
What can I say?
These words destroy all meaning,
There's only cliché to get across this feeling

It's you that I love and it's true that I love,
And it's love not given lightly,
And I knew this was love and it's you that I love,
And it's more than what it might be

This is a love song,
For no-one's mother,
This isn't easy,
I may not sing another

'Cause it's you that I love and it's true that I love,
And it's love not given lightly,
And I knew this was love and it's you that I love,
And it's more than what it might be
