KEEP SMILING, AMERICA

Taking the time to walk instead of drive,
Taking the time to feel a crooked smile,
Standing in the freezing cold,
I love it right down to my bones,
I wanna be alone for a while

Walking past the school late at night,
I’ve gotta make it home before it’s light,
My hair is wet, I smell like shit,
The benefits are infinite,
It’s just a game I’m playing in my mind

Challenging your heart to stop,
Too much is never enough,
My kidneys will break down and cry,
No-one is too young to die,
It’s no big deal,
These things you feel,
It’s no big deal to be so real

Taking the time to walk instead of drive,
Taking the time to feel a crooked smile,
Standing in the freezing cold,
I love it right down to my bones,
I wanna be alone for a while

Challenging your heart to stop,
Too much is never enough,
My kidneys will break down and cry,
No-one is too young to die,
It’s no big deal,
These things you feel,
It’s no big deal to be so real
