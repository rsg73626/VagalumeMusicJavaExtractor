VIOLENT MOTIONS CREATED

Your parents do not love you despite what they might say,
They just want a servant,
One they don't have to pay,
Your parents do not love you,
It's like a myth from school,
When you can't find a reason,
Or understand the rules

Inner peace, world hatred,
Violent motions created

Your parents do not love you though they might think they do,
They've told so many lies,
They don't know which ones are true,
Your parents do not love you,
It's just one of their schemes,
They just want you to fulfil their middle-class dreams

Inner peace, world hatred,
Violent motions created

Your parents do not love you,
Look at how they treat each other,
You're learning a big lesson when your father hits your mother,
Your parents do not love you when they tell you to behave,
Now you're ready for the world,
A happy little slave

Inner peace, world hatred,
Violent motions created
