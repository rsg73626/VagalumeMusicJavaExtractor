SECRETS

Last night I saw your skin go red,
From your smelly little feet to the top of your head,
Why do I feel so ashamed?
I know, I know, I know, I know
You read old letters written to me,
I found an ancient lyric sheet,
It felt like reading my diary from 1983

It’s okay with me,
You can keep your secrets with me,
So when you wanna publish your memoirs,
You’ll have to come looking for me,
Hey!

Why do I feel so ashamed?
Every word I’ve written now seems so lame,
This song is not exempt,
I wrote it in less than half a day,
You read old letters written to me in the pages of a fanzine,
Felt like reading my diary from 1983

It’s okay with me,
You can keep your secrets with me,
So when you wanna publish your memoirs,
You’ll have to come looking for me

Why do I feel so ashamed?
Every word I’ve written now seems so lame,
This song is not exempt,
I wrote it in less than half a day,
You read old letters written to me in the pages of a fanzine,
Felt like reading my diary,
From 1993 or just last week
