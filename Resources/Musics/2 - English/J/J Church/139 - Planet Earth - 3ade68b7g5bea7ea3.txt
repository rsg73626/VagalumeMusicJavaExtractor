PLANET EARTH

Only came outside to watch the nightfall with the rain,
I heard you making patterns rhyme,
Like some new romantic looking for the TV sound,
You'll see I'm right some other time

Look now, look all around, there's no sign of life,
Voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
This is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth,
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - this is planet earth

My head is stuck on something precious,
Let me know if you're coming down to land,
Is there anybody out there trying to get through,
My eyes so cloudy I can't see who

Look now, look all around, not a sign of life,
Voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
This is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth,
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - this is planet earth

Look now, look all around, there's no sign of life,
Voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
This is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth,
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - this is planet earth,
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - calling planet earth,
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - this is planet earth,
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - calling planet earth
