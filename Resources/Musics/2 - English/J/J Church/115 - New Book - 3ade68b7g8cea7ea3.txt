NEW BOOK

You're staring at your watch,
You're staring at your watch again,
You're staring at your watch,
You're staring at your watch again

You're staring at your watch,
It's one of your neurotic habits,
Like back at the party,
So sick of psycho sychophantics

You're hot,
You're cold,
You can't think about it,
You're like the books along your wall

You're jaded,
Overrated,
There's no doubt about it,
So here's a new book for you to read

You're talking to yourself,
You're talking to yourself again,
You're talking to yourself,
You're talking to yourself again

You're talking to yourself,
About a friend who was put away,
For breaking in labs,
And once again, youâ€™ve got nothing of value to say

You're hot,
You're cold,
You can't think about it,
You're like the books along your wall

You're jaded,
Overrated,
There's no doubt about it,
So here's a new book for you to read
