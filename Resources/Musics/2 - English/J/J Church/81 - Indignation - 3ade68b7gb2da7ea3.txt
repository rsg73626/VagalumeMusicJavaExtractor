INDIGNATION

She's not a bitch, she's not a slut,
But she says she is both,
That was a statement but it's just her indignation,
She wants a band to be the antithesis of everything,
Secretly revealing what's appealing to me

She can play drums which was once good enough for me,
Now her picture's in the paper and everything,
And I missed the wedding, I don't think she expected me,
But I saw the picture with the family

Don't spend the night,
Don't start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right,
Don't spend the night,
Don't start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right

She sends me a postcard I'll stare at for a week,
Maybe lacking content but the gesture is sweet,
I don't like the record though I'll never tell her lies,
[Blue?] amongst the truth when I write a letter

She said she loved the sea and I'm not surprised,
Our old apartment looked like something out of the decline,
She's getting on with life,
I know she'll be all right,
Just one of many stars in the night

Don't spend the night,
Don't start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right,
Don't spend the night,
Don't start a fight,
Nothing's gonna be all right

Nothing's gonna be all right,
Nothing's gonna be all right
