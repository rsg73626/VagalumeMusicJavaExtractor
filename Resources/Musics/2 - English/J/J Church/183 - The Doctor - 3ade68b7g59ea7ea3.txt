THE DOCTOR

I am the doctor and I
Keep you mutilated and I
Keep your body perverted and I'm
Lost in inertia,
You're getting better,
You seem to be improving,
But there's never gonna be a cure,
But you're definitely getting better

I am the doctor and I
Keep you mutilated, 
I keep you mutilated

So here's the future,
Lab rats of leisure,
In the name of science,
It gives little resistance,
To push a theory,
Let me pose a question,
Are you willing to die for,
A lucrative infection?

And I am the doctor and I
Keep you mutilated, 
I keep you mutilated

You read the paper,
It lies in bold face,
You strangely feel safer,
Allergic to the ink,
It smells like poison,
A new elixir,
A trace of death,
Most becoming the victor

And I am the doctor,
I keep you mutilated, 
I keep you mutilated
