WINTER COMES AGAIN

In the end, winter comes again,
And I won't allow myself,
To entertain last season's morbid thoughts,
She's waiting in the rain,
Said "Meet me by the train",
It's Christmas time, we're going to get away

Turn the key, open the door,
You don't want to see my face any more,
Fading like the snow to rain,
Turn the key, open the door,
You don't want to see my face any more,
Fading like the snow to rain

[He's putting it all to?] experience,
[There's a good locked door]?,
Through the windows, triggering alarm codes,
Set a pitch for his love,
Gets a bullet in the chest,
He tries to recall her face as his socks are damp with blood

Turn the key, open the door,
You don't want to see my face any more,
Fading like the snow to rain,
Turn the key, open the door,
You don't want to see my face any more,
Fading like the snow to rain

Winter comes again,
Father Christmas drunk on gin,
Can't bring himself to face the world again,
She's waiting in the rain,
Said "Meet me by the train",
It's Christmas time, we're going to get away

Turn the key, open the door,
You don't want to see my face any more,
Fading like the snow to rain,
Turn the key, open the door,
You don't want to see my face any more,
Fading like the snow to rain
