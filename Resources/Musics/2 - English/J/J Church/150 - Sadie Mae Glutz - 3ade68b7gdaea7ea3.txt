SADIE MAE GLUTZ

Sadie Mae Glutz was just a fan,
When she got the big call to the masterplan,
On a still hot August night,
She dipped her hand in the blood and began to write

Superstar sings super clear,
North America getting the fear

Sadie Mae Glutz had a bigger list,
Stars the revolver somehow missed,
Liz Taylor, Richard Burton were next to die,
And Frank Sinatra would be skinned alive

Superstar sings super clear,
North America getting the fear

Sadie Mae Glutz was in the pen,
When she got the crazy notion to be born again,
She may never be red or blue,
Every letter is a secret clue

Superstar sings super clear,
North America getting the fear
