WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD

You can watch the stills,
Watch it happen just outside of Munich,
Or any major city (for that matter),
Throughout Germany and Poland,
The oxygen changes with each progressing photo,
You can see it in his face,
In this snuff documentary

Without a single word you walk through the dead museum,
Impressed yet unimpressed at the same time

"Why would you want to go there?",
They ask at the front desk,
I may not believe in Anne Frank,
But I still believe it happened,
It's a concentration,
Of daily execution,
Its only contradiction,
A denial of involvement

You don’t want to go there,
You don’t want to go there

Without a single word you walk through the dead museum,
Impressed yet unimpressed at the same time
