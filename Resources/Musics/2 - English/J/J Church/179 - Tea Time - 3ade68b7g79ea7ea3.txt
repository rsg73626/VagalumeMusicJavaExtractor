TEA TIME

Put the dishes in the sink please,
Or the roaches will have a feast,
The leftovers in the fridge please,
It's time to have some tea

The things you are forgetting,
The kitten's needing petting,
And my back, aching,
I guess it comes with age

Put the dishes in the sink please,
Or the roaches will have a feast,
The leftovers in the fridge please,
It's time to have some tea

The rain on the pane,
The cookie's getting stale.
Every day, the same,
I've settled down, I guess, I guess, I guess
