TIDE OF FATE

Riding in the back, in the back, in the back with no shell,
Trying hard, trying hard, trying hard, trying hard to stay warm,
Trying to keep the bugs out of our mouths,
All that is still is me, you and the stars

Nothing's moving,
Nothing's breathing,
Nothing's changing,
It's sorrow,
Nothing's ever gonna make me plan tomorrow

I could sleep under open skies if I'm back at work by Monday,
Swim against the tide of fate if I'm back at work by Monday

Trying to stay, trying to stay, trying to stay, trying to stay up all night,
Junk food, bad coffee, speeding, speeding all night,
Fast forward the VCR through the better parts of Urgh! A Music War,
All that's left is me, you and the stars

Nothing's moving,
Nothing's breathing,
Nothing's changing,
It's sorrow,
Nothing's ever gonna make me plan tomorrow

I could sleep under open skies if I'm back at work by Monday,
Swim against the tide of fate if I'm back at work by Monday

Nothing's moving,
Nothing's breathing,
Nothing's changing,
It's sorrow

Nothing's moving,
Nothing's breathing,
Nothing's changing,
It's sorrow,
Nothing's ever gonna make me plan tomorrow

I could sleep my life away if I really didn't care,
When the going got rough they called my bluff,
When the light was just a glare
