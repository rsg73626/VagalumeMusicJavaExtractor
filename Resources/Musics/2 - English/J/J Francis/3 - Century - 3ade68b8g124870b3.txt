CENTURY

A wallward eye flickers in the light
So tired of it
A gust disrobed, century revise
I fucking hate it

Haunt me, lowly heart
Buried it howling
Dancing in the dust
In the forebay standing for it
Buried in the dust

I could drown as fast as I swim
I know you and you know him
Suffocate me on a whim
Cut my throat and scratch my skin
