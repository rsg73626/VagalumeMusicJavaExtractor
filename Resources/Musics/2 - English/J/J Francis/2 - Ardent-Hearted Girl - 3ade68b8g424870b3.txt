ARDENT-HEARTED GIRL

Blood red on the table
Dimming on the window sill
Push yourself up on the ceiling
Flowers dying in the evening
Come back now, ardent-hearted girl
Here she comes now
Violent motions
Then the cry calls
Vile emotion
All this sorrow, ardent-hearted girl

Hanging over everything
Buried in your heart
Holding down and giving up
You clearly just don't give a fuck
It's nothing now, ardent-hearted girl

Life is different these days
Lost in time, this year
Wilting trees, it's getting darker
Welting, always try to guard her
Listless now, ardent-hearted girl

Here she comes now
Violent motions
Then the cry calls
Vile emotion
Drowning gently
Violet oceans
Then the cry calls
Vile devotion
All this sorrow, ardent-hearted girl
