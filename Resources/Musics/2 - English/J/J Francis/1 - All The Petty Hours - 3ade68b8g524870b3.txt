ALL THE PETTY HOURS

Dream for me
I can't see you
I can't speak for you
You can't save this
Begging everyone, don't drown me

So I'm
One- "I won't surrender"
Two - "pain never-ending"
Three - "dream of younger selves"
Four - I close the door on myself

Cry for him
He won't be here
He was different then
I am different now
I can't cry for this anymore

So I'm
One: "I won't surrender"
Two: "pain never-ending"
Three: "dream of younger selves"
Four: I close the
I've been so desperately tied
