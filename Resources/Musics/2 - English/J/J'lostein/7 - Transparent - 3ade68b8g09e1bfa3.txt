TRANSPARENT

Ice and snow, crystal glass,
Steady heartbeat, one last breath
Fading laughter, fading time,
The notes got to me and changed my mind

My sights collide
No strength to deny...

CHORUS

Cos I'm transparent
I don't believe in faking my lullabies
And when I believe it
That's when I'm waiting for someone
To see my light.
Wasting time, I don't know why.

Catch your rosebuds, hear your name,
If I'm ready I can take the blame
Unsheltered houses, who I am,
And maybe I don't understand

My sights collide
No strength to deny...

CHORUS x 2

Cos I'm transparent
I don't believe in faking my lullabies
And when I believe it
That's when I'm waiting for someone
To change my life
Desperate times,
desperate eyes.
