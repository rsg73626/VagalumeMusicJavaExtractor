OF MINE

Of Mine

These scars of mine, they signify,
All that I've seen in life.
The turning tide, not coming by,
Taking too long to fly.

It's not always light, sometimes it's grey,
Chasing yesterday...

Chorus:

When one ocean is done, there's another one,
With higher waves.
When you're chasing the sun, to be stepped upon,
Then it goes away.
Has someone been lying when they said it's for the
best?

No time to cry, no time to sigh,
Finding the meaning.
Seen it all, it hurts no more,
But still unforgiving.

Keep telling myself that all it does
Is make me strong...

C/O

For the best...
I think someone lied to me...

C/O

I think someone lied to me...
I think someone lied to me...

When I'm down on the ground, with no one around,
And I can't see.
When I get up to stand, pick myself up again,
Then maybe...

Maybe it's true that all these scars are for...
Maybe it's true that all these scars are for the best.
