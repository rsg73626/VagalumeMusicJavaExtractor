WALTZ

'll tell you a story, they're not always happy,
I'll tell you a fantasy, they're not always pretty.
I'll write you a letter, it's not signed 'I love you',
I'll tell you a fairytale, that never comes true.

Do you see now, do you realise?
It's a given, this thing they call 'Life'.

CHORUS:

You'll be fine, you'll be strong, be alright,
It's okay, you can try, you can cry.
You just fall just to learn how to stand,
We break down just to get up again.


I'll paint you a picture, but it's not in colour,
I'll catch you a shooting star, it might shine no more.
I'll find you your heart again, it might be alright,
I'll sing you a melody, it might make you cry.

Do you see now, do you understand?
It's a given, the good and the bad.

CHORUS x 2

Cos you'll be fine, I believe you're alright,
It's okay, go ahead, you can cry.
Cos how can we stand if we never fall?
You're alright, cos I know that you're strong.

Cos I know, cos I know that you're strong.
