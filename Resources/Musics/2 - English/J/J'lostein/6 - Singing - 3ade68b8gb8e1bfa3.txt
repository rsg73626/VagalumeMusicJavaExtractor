SINGING

Sing inside me, oh breathe, belie me,
Take what you get, oh I don't mind,
Breathe inside me, oh can you see clearly,
Or do you believe it when I smile?

Ah...
Ah...

CHORUS:

Do you see what you should see,
Through my simple chords, my melodies?
Do you feel, do you hear,
All my little words, my notes, my fears?
Please don't forget me,
Please know that I hurt too.

Try, divide me, oh slowly guide me,
Do you think you know my mind?
Try to see that there's a place inside me,
Or do you forget it when I smile?

Ah...
Ah...

CHORUS:

Do you see what you should see?
When I sing my songs, my melodies?
Do you feel, do you hear,
All my little words that say I'm here?
Please don't forget me,
Please know that I hurt too.

I'm alright,
Thanks, I'm fine...

Ah...
Ah...

I guess you don't see what you should see,
When I sing to you these melodies,
You don't feel, you don't hear,
All my little words that mean so dear,
I guess you forgot me, but,
You should know I hurt too...
