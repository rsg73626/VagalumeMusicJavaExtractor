MOONFLOWER (FEAT. YU PHOENIX)

Clarity left me before all you could be
In sleep you meet, what you think isn't me

Am I the only eye that sees
Existence can never be unless

Distance rest its' eyes and truth lies
Just to see me breathing life
Seas of stars will soothe your fears
While you're drowning in your dreams, my dear
Make me real, make me be,
Make me somebody
All I need, all I seek
All you need to feel
Believe, just for me,
To breathe, silently.

To make me real

Alone you feel, what you need, suddenly
In a chain of lost, unresolved memories

Still I'm the only eye that sees
What I could never be unless

Distance rest its' eyes and truth lies
Just to see me breathing life
Seas of stars will soothe your fears
While you're drowning in your dreams, my dear
Make me real, make me be,
Make me somebody
All I need, all I seek
All you need to feel
Believe, just for me,
To breathe, silently.

Seek a purpose, seek a reason,
Find the light in those pale eyes
Seas of stars
The forsaken in my intent of pride

Am I the only eye that sees
Existence can never be unless

Distance rest its' eyes and truth lies
Just to see me breathing life
Seas of stars will soothe your fears
While you're drowning in your dreams, my dear
Endless times I've lost my moments
Endless times I've wondered why
When the time for dreaming's over
Where will I bring in the light?

Make me real, make me be,
Make me somebody
All I need, all I seek
All you need to feel
Believe, just for me,
To breathe, silently.
