UNREAL

Give me a wish, give me an answer,
Sometimes I wonder if I matter,
Oh for a home, oh for another,
Place I can feel like I matter.

Is it raining, is it sunny, cold?
I can't tell for sure.

CHORUS:

Cos when I'm unknown, thinking alone,
My time isn't long, I will go on.
Somewhere I'm cold, a face you don't know,
I want you to see, all that is me.

Where is the snow, where is the river?
Gravity is taking over.
No monochrome, I'd like some colour,
I'm tired of waiting til it's over.

And maybe I'll finally
Admit to feeling lonely...

CHORUS x2

It's when I'm alone, too tired to go,
Smiling for you, telling the truth,
Somewhere I know, my life will unfold,
Pay all my dues, singing for you...
