IN MY OWN MIND

You couldn't leave me a single beat of my heart,
You started looking for ends when there was no start,
And even when you would lie at least you cared,
But now you don't even bother or try to pretend... or defend...

CHORUS:

Need I, shouldn't I be leaving?
Lost myself in my own mind,
Got my eyes but
Lately I've been feeling like I'm breaking,
Wonder why it took so long,
Why am I still holding on to you?

Cos you're nothing...

There's nothing that you don't claim to know or see,
And with one look of your eyes I can't be me,
You tell me bow my head down, that's what I do,
I wonder how long will you keep twisting the truth... of you...

CHORUS

You are nothing...
You are nothing...
Only something that breaks my mind in two...

CHORUS

And maybe I, never will see clearly,
Broken all the mirror's glass,
Still I see you laugh
And I, try to wake up slowly,
This is taking far too long,
But why am I still holding on to you?
