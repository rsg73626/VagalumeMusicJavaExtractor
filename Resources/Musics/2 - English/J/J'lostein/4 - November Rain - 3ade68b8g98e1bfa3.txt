NOVEMBER RAIN

Can you see me falling?
Do you hear me crying?
Do you even care?
You said all I do is wrong,
I'm too tired to go on,
But I care.

Break so easily,
Do you know just how you treat me?

CHORUS:

I'll run away again, try to say goodbye,
Silent tears again, broken down inside,
It seems what's left of me is just nothing more,
I'll stand alone and taste the November rain,
Before I go again.

I'm all alone and lonely,
I don't think you'll hold me,
You look so tired.
Lying here alone,
I wish we could call this home,
Without the lies.

Born into this world but where do I go?
Is tomorrow something I won't know?

CHORUS

Hello, I'm here
Hello, I care.
Hello, I'm here,
But are you there?

Can you see me falling?
Do you know I'm hurting?

CHORUS x2

Can you see me falling?
Do you know I'm hurting?
But do you even care?
