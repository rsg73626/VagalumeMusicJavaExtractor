WISHING STARS

Dear delight, dear divine,
Was it ever so wrong to be kind?
Is this fight, really mine?
Is this really what you had in mind?

You swam the oceans, locked the doors,
You told yourself 'not anymore',
You pushed your dreams, you hid your face,
And made them go away.


CHORUS:
Your wishing stars,
Your wandering heart,
Your spirit bound in chains.
Your desperate start,
You will go far,
It's never all in vain.

Honestly, it's not me,
I can only just help you believe
You could stay, you could try,
You could simply just sit there and cry.

There's no one else, there's nothing more,
There's only you down on the floor.
Recall your dreams, lift up your face,
Don't let them get away.


CHORUS:
Your wishing stars,
Your wandering heart,
Your spirit bound in chains.
Your desperate start,
You will go far,
Believe it's not in vain

There's no one else, there's nothing more,
There's only you down on the floor.
Recall your dreams, lift up your face,
Don't let them get away.


CHORUS:
Your wishing stars,
Your wandering heart,
Your spirit free from chains.
Your steady start,
You will go far,
It's never all in vain.
