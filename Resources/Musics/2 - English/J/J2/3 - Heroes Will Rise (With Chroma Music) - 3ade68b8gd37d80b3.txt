HEROES WILL RISE (WITH CHROMA MUSIC)

When all hope is lost
And there's no end in sight
Lift up your eyes
Heroes will rise

And lay down your fear
And get ready to fight
Heroes will rise
Heroes will rise

When all hope is lost
And there's no end in sight
Lift up your eyes
Heroes will rise

And lay down your fear
Get ready to fight
Heroes will rise!
Heroes will rise!
