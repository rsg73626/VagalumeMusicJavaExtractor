RISE UP

Gather up your homes and all belongings
Cause it is clear that we won't be alone for long
I hear them running
I hear them running

Show me how to feel alive
Show me how to rise up now, rise up now
OOh
If I gotta face the fight
Show me how to stand up high
Show me how to rise up, rise up now

Play with sticks and stones
For my defenses
Are wearing thin
This freedom is our own
I crave it more than ever

Show me how to feel alive
Show me how to rise up now, rise up now
OOh
If I gotta face the fight
Show me how to stand up high
Show me how to rise up, rise up now

Rise up, rise up now
Rise up, rise up now

Hold me, help me stand
Keep me safe from burning in their hands
Burning in their hands

Show me how to feel alive
Show me how to rise up now, rise up now
OOh
If I gotta face the fight
Show me how to stand up high
Show me how to rise up, rise up now

Rise up, rise up now
Rise up, rise up now
