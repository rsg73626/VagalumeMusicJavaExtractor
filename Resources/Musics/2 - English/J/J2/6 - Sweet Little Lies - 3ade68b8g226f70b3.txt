SWEET LITTLE LIES

If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my eyes, close my eyes

I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies, lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me, tell me
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me, tell me

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Tell me, tell me
Tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me, tell me
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
You can't disguise
Oh, no, you can't disguise

Tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me, tell me
Tell me lies

Sweet little lies
