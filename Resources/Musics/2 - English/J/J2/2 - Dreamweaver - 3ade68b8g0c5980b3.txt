DREAMWEAVER

I have just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the dream weaver train
Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Fly me high and through the starry skies
Or maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Oh dreamweaver
You can get me through the night
Oh dreamweaver
We can reach the morning light

Oh dreamweaver
You can get me through the night
Oh dreamweaver
We can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

Oh dreamweaver
You can get me through the night
Oh dreamweaver
We can reach the morning light

Oh dreamweaver
You can get me through the night
Oh dreamweaver

We can reach the morning light

We can reach the morning light
