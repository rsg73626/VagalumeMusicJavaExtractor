GOOD LOOKING WOMAN

I've got good luck woman
She's so sweet to me
I've got good luck woman
She's so sweet to me

Everytime she's kiss me out
Goin' in a misery

Man you'll bring me back but I want
I have shoulda see mine
You'll bring me back, but woman
Man you'll should see mine

Everytime she's fine she's beauty
She's the woman will be mine

I've got good luck woman
Gimme the thing I want
I've got good luck woman
Gimme the thing I want

She's said C'mon home dear love
Because have myself alone
