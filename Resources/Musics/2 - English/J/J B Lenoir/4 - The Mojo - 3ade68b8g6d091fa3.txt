THE MOJO

The Mojo 

I been to New Orleans, I sure had a wonderful time 
I been to New Orleans, I sure had a wonderful time 
I was high, high as a Georgia pine 

You know, my auntie carried me all down on Rampart Street 
I seen everybody I wanted to meet 
She said, J.B., son, stop and listen to me, 
They got something knock you off of your feet 

They got the mojo boogie 
Mojo boogie 
They got the mojo boogie, begin to slide on down 

I thought she was talkin' about over in Algiers 
I said, Auntie, please tell me, what did you say? 
They got the Louisiana boogie, all them other kind of things, 
They even got the thing they call the mojo hand 

They got the mojo boogie 
Mojo boogie 
They got the mojo boogie, begin to slide on down 

I got one jack, sure is crazy 
My aunt forgot to teach me, just how to operate it 
I went to a night club, I was squeezing it tight 
I believe that's the cause of them people's start to fight 

I had the mojo boogie 
Mojo boogie 
I had the mojo boogie, begin to slide on down
