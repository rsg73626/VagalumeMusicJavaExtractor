WALK AWAY

You dont really gotta tell me hes gone
Cuz I been waiting here for so long
Tell me baby where your going
Where were going to be baby
Cant stand to see you like this
How could you be so heartless
Now I think its time to make a change

Said im never gunna change your ways
I guess I gotta walk away without you
I dont wanna be the one to turn my back so easily
Im sorry but im walking away
But I really gotta do this now before this love gets the best of me
Im sorry but im walking away
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
(said I gotta go, said I aint got no other way)
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away

You say you aint going nowhere
When your next to me your really not here
Always blame, always make me feel ashamed
But you know it aint the same thing now
Now all the pain you put me through
So much for me and but nothing to you
Now (?) before I fall apart (ohh)

Said im never gunna change your ways
I guess I gotta walk away without you
I dont wanna be the one to turn my back so easily
Im sorry but im walking away
But I really gotta do this now before this love gets the best of me
Im sorry but im walking away
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
(said I gotta go, said I aint got no other way)
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away

When is love,
Aint gonna play no games its not the way its suppose to be
No, no, no, no oh oh oh
The way we touch
Though your bodys close to me
I can feel your love walking away

I dont wanna be the one to turn my back so easily
Im sorry but im walking away
But I really gotta do this now before this love gets the best of me
Im sorry but im walking away
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
(said I gotta go, said I aint got no other way)
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away

I dont wanna be the one to turn my back so easily..
