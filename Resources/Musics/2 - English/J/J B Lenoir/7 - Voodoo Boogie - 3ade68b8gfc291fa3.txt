VOODOO BOOGIE

Voodoo Boogie

Ah, ah one, two, a one, two, three, four 

I flew to Algiers, I sure had a wonderful time 
I flew to Algiers, and I sure had a wonderful time 
I met a voodoo woman who was changin' a poor man's mind 

She said, Take your box, boy, walk on the flo' 
You got something nobody don't know 
You got the voodoo boogie 
The voodoo boogie 
You got the voodoo boogie, by changing a po' man's mind 

Sometimes it turn you upside down 
Sometimes it turn you 'round and 'round 
You got the voodoo boogie 
The voodoo boogie 
You got the Voodoo boogie, by changing a po' man's mind
