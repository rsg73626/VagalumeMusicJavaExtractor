Lord I got my questionnaire
Uncle Sam gonna send me away from here
He says JB you can hide but you cannot run
Now lately you have to be in Vietnam
Sweetheart please don't you worry
I'm just beginnin' to fly in the air
Sweetheart please don't you worry
I'm just beginnin' to fly in the air
Now they in Vietnam shootin' 'em down over there
Lord you'll find my body there somewhere
Oh Lord I wonder
I wonder when will all wars come to an end
Oh Lord I wonder
I wonder when will all wars come to an end
Now in Vietnam, shootin' 'em down and sayin'
My son Jebra(?) will rise up and fight again
