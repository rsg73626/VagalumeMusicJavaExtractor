YOU WILL BE MINE

You Will Be Mine 

You're my survivor, you're the reason I get out of bed.
My love is like not dead.
I can't concentrate, your always on mind.
You've always been so kind.
The reason I'm so blue.
Is because I know I can't be with you.

(Chorus)
If we don't stop every once in a while.
We'll see the good things always pass us by.
I'm not going to waste another minute.
I've been waiting long enough.
My time is up, and you will be mine.

The way you look at me.
It's plainly to see, that we belong together.
Your blue eyes and your brown hair.
It's rare that I meet a girl like you.
The reason I'm so blue.
Is because I know I can't be with you.

(Chorus)

My heart is telling me what to do.
What it's telling me what to do, is to love you.
I've been waiting long enough.
My time is up, and you will be mine

(Chorus)
If we don't stop every once in a while.
We'll see the good things always pass us by.
I'm not going to waste another minute.
I've been waiting long enough.
My time is up, and you will be mine.
I don't want to waste another minute.
And You will be mine, you will be mine
