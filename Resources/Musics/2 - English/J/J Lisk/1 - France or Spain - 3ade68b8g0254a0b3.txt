FRANCE OR SPAIN

Real recognize the same type
Y'all stop, I aint ever lose sight
Yeah you could come catch this flight
But I aint gonna wait all night

I told you I'mma catch that plane
We booking it to France or Spain
When the clock strikes 12 and the lights go out
Man I'mma just do my thing

I just want to feel alive
Out here on the east side
I just want to be alright
Have myself a good time

Lets get lost tonight
Lets get lost tonight
