A SONG FOR HER

Yesterday, without saying a word
She kissed me so much
I Think she loves me

Now, she's my world
she's my world now
she's my world now
I think God sent roses to me

Of course I go sing this happiness
Because that me makes forget
the sorrowful of one the time

Now, she's my world
she's my world now
she's my world now
She's the woman of my life

Who has passed a winter alone
Knows when can sing under the covers
So I sing as if God were to arrive

As if there were only the sky below of lovers

I dance under the sun and under the rain
under the sun and under the rain
under the sun and under the rain

As if there were only the sky below of lovers
