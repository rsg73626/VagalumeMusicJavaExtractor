TRIALS

I been walkin' around this town to wallow in my sorrow
To get any peace that I can find
I don't worry about myself I always have tomorrow
And people seem to think I'm fine

When it comes to my past mistakes I have no reservations
I don't think I'd change anything at all
Now it's time to move on and so I focus on my future
When all my trials will be over

I ain't got nobody but me who can see where I'm going or where I've been
And all the things that I have seen, have really got me thinkin'
That people can change and let their life slip away but it's somethin' I won't do
'Cause I've got somethin' that's gonna get me on through

I been thinkin' about the sadness of my situation
Just tryin' to make sense of it all
The way that you turned your back to save your reputation
And then you didn't even call

Now you know that I'm right because you told me that you're sorry
But all apologies void inside my mind
Now it's time to grow up and so I focus on my future
When all my trials will be over

Would you leave me at the drop of hat
Would you turn your back, 'cause I wouldn't
Would you leave me at the drop of hat
Would you turn your back
