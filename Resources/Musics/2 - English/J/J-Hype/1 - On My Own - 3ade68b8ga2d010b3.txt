ON MY OWN

With every day, with every minute
I only think of you
With every move, with every morning
All the things we used to do

I lost my pride, I lost my world
I lost my mind, I lost my girl
So baby tell me, can we ever get it back, whoa

I don't wanna live if you ain't here
Can't make it on my own
If I'm the lock then you're the key
Can't make it on my own

There's no I in team know that I can't do this alone
Cause you complete me
Girl I can't make it on my own
You complete me, I can't make it on my own

I miss your smile, I miss your kisses
I miss you in my arms, yeah, yeah
I miss your love so let's pretend we never broak up, whoa

I lost my pride, I lost my world
I lost my mind, I lost my girl
So baby tell me, can we ever get it back, whoa

I don't wanna live if you ain't here
Can't make it on my own
If I'm the lock then you're the key
Can't make it on my own

There's no I in team know that I can't do this alone
Cause you complete me
Girl I can't make it on my own
You complete me, I can't make it on my own
Said you complete me
Know I can't make it on my won, whoa

I don't wanna live if you ain't here
Can't make it on my own
If I'm the lock then you're the key
Can't make it on my own

There's no I in team know that I can't do this alone
Cause you complete me
Girl I can't make it on my own
You complete me, I can't make it on my own
