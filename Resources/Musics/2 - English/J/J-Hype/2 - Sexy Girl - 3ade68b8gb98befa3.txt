SEXY GIRL

Make way for the girl
Round of applause
Looks like an angel
But she acts like a boss

The kind of girl I want
The girl of my dreams
And I wonder it's only fantasy
When she says stay with me
I want this feeling to last an eternity
When she says stay with me
I get the feeling I'm on top of the world

Everybody wants you
With them high heel shoes
Hey whoa-oh-oh
Go ahead sexy girl
Shawty got swag making all them haters mad
Whoa-oh-oh
Go ahead sexy girl
She got me saying oh oh oh
Go ahead sexy girl
She got me saying oh oh oh
Go ahead sexy girl

Leader of her pack, everybody knows
People be following her everywhere she goes
Flashing lights, paparazzi
I don't know what's happening to me

When she says stay with me
I want this feeling to last an eternity
When she says stay with me
I get the feeling I'm on top of the world

Everybody wants you
With them high heel shoes
Hey whoa-oh-oh
Go ahead sexy girl
Shawty got swag making all them haters mad
Whoa-oh-oh
Go ahead sexy girl
She got me saying oh oh oh
Go ahead sexy girl
She got me saying oh oh oh
Go ahead sexy girl

Sexy girl I wanna get to know you
Sexy girl so many things that I can show you
Sexy girl I wanna get to know you
Sexy girl, sexy girl

When she says stay with me
I want this feeling to last an eternity
When she says stay with me
I get the feeling I'm on top of the world

Everybody wants you
With them high heel shoes
Hey whoa-oh-oh
Go ahead sexy girl
Shawty got swag making all them haters mad
Whoa-oh-oh
Go ahead sexy girl
She got me saying oh oh oh
Go ahead sexy girl
