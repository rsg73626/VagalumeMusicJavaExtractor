YOU'RE ONLY LONELY

When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders,
And when you're feeling lonely and small,
You need somebody there to hold you.
You can call out my name...when you're only lonely,
Now, don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely,

When you need somebody around on the nights that try you,
(remember) i was there when you were a queen,
And i'll be the last one there beside you.
So you can call out my name...when you're only lonely.
Now, don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely,

When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders,
And when you're feeling lonely and small,
You need somebody there to hold you.
So don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely.
Ah, you can call out my name...when you're only lonely,

When you're only lonely...
Ah, it's no crime...darling, we've got lots of time.

Ah, there's nothing wrong with you...
Darling, i get lonely, too.

So if you need me, all you gotta do is call me.
You're only lonely
