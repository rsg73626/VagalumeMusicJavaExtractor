GENTLE & ELEGANT

I always pictured you with flowers in your hair. 
dancing in the dry rain. you held color beyond love. 
yet the sensation to no longer walk in is alive. 
in my eyes and heart. 
and all I could ask was for you to love but I am guessing that was even to hard. 
breaking the snows silence and this was the end.
