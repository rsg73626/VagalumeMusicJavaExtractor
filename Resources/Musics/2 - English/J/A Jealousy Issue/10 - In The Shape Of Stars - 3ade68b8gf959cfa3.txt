IN THE SHAPE OF STARS

tears overcome blistering rain
the truth of you arrives
and i wish i could let this die
like each wasted breath
but these things never mend
it must always end
with your head held up high
and star shaped slits
carved into each of my wrists
your hands are held against my face
craving faint reminders of every tear
that coalesces with the wintry night
i called you mine
and i can't let this die
throught the darkest night
one last heartfelt glance
will cross these constellations
and i can't let this die
i can't let this fade
1-2-3-4
deviate me frm these sacrificed seconds
spent dreaming of your eyes
pouring lies and letting my heart inhale
full breaths of you
like lungs deprived of your air
and i'm lucky i can still breathe
after what you did to me
i still have one last breath
i need to see those eyes
i still have one last breath
don't just end it all
