SCHEMING DREAMING JUGGERNAUT

Discard these weighted wings and rise
As high as these heavy skies
Rise from a sitation that sickens me
I inflict the kindest cut of all
Weave the weakest cloth into steel
As i embrace invention

From this manufactured mess
Will appear a more desirable design
So far from what i was
So close to what i could be

Abandoning past reflections
I will not miss me
No longer ruled by imperfections
I will not miss me
And now i am invincible
So fucking invincible
Just try and fucking stop me

A frame once rendered frail
Now suddenly superhuman
Incapable of doubt
A structure free from flaws

An immovable mass
Of sentinel contruction
So far from what i was
So close to what i could be

Nothing matters anymore

Untouchable unstoppable
Everyone is beneath me
