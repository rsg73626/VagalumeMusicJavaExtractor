PAPERWEIGHT

i bleed through every single day
with this burden labeled heart
worn thin by disappointment
hanging by a thread
a magnet for incisions
it has made me weak
an accomplice to malfunction
filled to the brim with lead
it serves no purpose
i have no need for this heart
for it receives no love at all
so impractical in it's nature
just a charming paperweight
defined only by shape not worth
i curse this heart
i wish it death
one stitch could save me
this heart just needs a spark
but it will not come soon enough
and i will once again be lost beneath the black
i curse this heart
i wish it death
