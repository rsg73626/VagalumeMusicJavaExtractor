VULTURE

I need a miracle to conquer this endeavor
The imagery of song to portray the routine of life
Maybe im neurotic or just wrong in general
Maybe I should concede and put out the fire 

Can you feel this uproar festering desire in my thoughts
I can promise you one thing
I will haunt you
till you die
Can you feel this uproar festering desire in my thoughts
I can promise you one thing
I will hunt you
till you die 

In absence of your favor I would rather choose death
I'd prefer it would be executed only by you
No legacy fall short of understanding
Maybe I should concede and put out the fire
