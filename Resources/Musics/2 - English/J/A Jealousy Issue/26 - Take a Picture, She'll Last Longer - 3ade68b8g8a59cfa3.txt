TAKE A PICTURE, SHE'LL LAST LONGER

Chaos has never had a prettier package
A short but sweet disaster
I never had a chance to avoid such an explosion
Now it all comes crashing down
Let this serve as a reminder
Of the day somebody loved me
Will i stain your precious world
Just like you have stained mine
It all started with a goodbye
But you'll never die with distance
Crush me with a kiss and let your lipstick
Stain this collar before you go.
