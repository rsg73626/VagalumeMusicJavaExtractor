AND DAYS WERE LONGER

The sun still shines.
But not as much.
My memories have slowly turned to ash.
These photographs i had of you.
Are nothing more than frames.
I still don't know.
At what point did you descend.
Erased from my perspective.
Entrapped beyond the lines.
As fast as paperplanes can crash.
And rocketships can burn.
You quickly became a blur.
Always impossible to grasp.
These eyes can only crave a glance.
At the furthest star in my darkest sky.
Light years away from recollection.
I hope these words can reach you.
Cause my wings keep failing.
