OUR SECOND HOME

He knew that she would leave the light on for him
Suppose that it was possible that she forgot this night
Only the crescent moon dragged its way across the dirt path he walked on
And as he closed his eyes, his mind began to drift away
This time was the only time he was able to cover her mouth
as he ripped apart her chest with his nails
Her screams soaked his hand with with spit and blood
As she fell to the floor, he walked away with joy
