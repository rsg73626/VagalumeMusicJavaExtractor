ALMOST PERFECT BUT I FAILED

what else do I need to do? what else can I say?
sorry?
I have trained myself to love you. but you no longer look at me.
why?
what have I done to you?
I tried so hard to be perfect.
but you still throw me aside.
I wish I was the symbol of passion.
the passion that fills yours eyes.
but I was always second in your heart.
