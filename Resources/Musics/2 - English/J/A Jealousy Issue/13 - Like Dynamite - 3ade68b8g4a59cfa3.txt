LIKE DYNAMITE

You create a sound.
A noise i never heard.
But one i'd like to hear again.
Dissonant, yet so beautiful.
You've left me wanting more.
Strike a match.
I can see the sparks in your eyes.
This can't last forever.
You're like dynamite.
The flames could not fade faster.
I hope that you explode.
You feel like fire to me.
