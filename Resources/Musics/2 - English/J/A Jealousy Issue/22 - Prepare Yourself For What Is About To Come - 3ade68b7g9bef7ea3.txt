PREPARE YOURSELF FOR WHAT IS ABOUT TO COME

Let me rip the throat of your still warm body
Cover my eyes with the blood of lying fool
A person you sought after innocence in my arms
A person you took advantage of
For i am the fool
I am the fool you walked past threw these lies
I am the man that shall be punished
Let it be known that we create a desire
And that we are the only creatures that can
