MAUDLIN

her cloths were soaked with mildew
ropes burned their way
through her fragile thin wrists
I stood over her
watching to see
if she was going to live or die
I remember her
screaming and scratching to my arms
while I was tying her wrists
behind her back
she was kicking her legs
up and down in my direction
trying to prevent me from knotting the ropes
stop crying
I screamed in her face
you took me for granted this time
how could youve done this to me
I said as I punched the ground beside her
until fists were sore and bloody
honey this couldve all been different
if you had wanted it to be
I gently whispered in her ear
u don't care what you want anymore
this is what I want now
don't offer me anything
you will be wasting you breath
