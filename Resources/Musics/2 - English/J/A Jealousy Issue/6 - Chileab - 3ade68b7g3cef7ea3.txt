CHILEAB

Tell me what you wish to do?
You know that your wish most likely will not come true
Not to worry because your life has been one big disappointment anyway
Thinking that if I fall asleep to her breathing
It is not despair, it is certainly that I have suffered enough
and that I am sacrificing myself for her
Tell me what you wish to do, Chileab
