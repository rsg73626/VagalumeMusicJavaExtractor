JOAN SAID PLEASE

it could have been easier then this. 
it could have been so much more enjoyable, for the both of us. but it wasn't right. 
for me to waste time with you. 
thinking I even had a chance to make a difference in your life. just forget about it. 
forget about me. I was only trying to make you happy. 
you touched my face and kissed me on the forehead. 
this could not be the end. 
the end of something that was never started. 
and I will not give you any space. 
if any is given, it is the last feeling of our lips. 
how many times can you make up excuses not to be with me? only once.
