WHY DO YOU MAKE ME BLEED

I try and catch myself from crying but the tears are dead. I can cry on your command. 
I can scream making my lungs bleed. 
I can stare at a broken reflection seeing you laughing at me. I pretend so that I can kill you. 
pieces of my heart cut me like suicide. 
I crave her touch. I crave her kiss. 
I wish I fell in love and never wakened from it's slumber. I wish I fell in love.
