JUST BEFORE HIS CRUCIFIXION

screaming out loud. 
I loved everyone. 
I never meant to hurt anyone. 
just as the nails of so many man before 
Me, drove through My skin. 
it seemed to silence His lips. 
for no one really cared. 
He then let out a cry that was heard for miles and miles. His love joined in with cries of love. 
screaming at the top of Her lungs. 
screaming for something pure. 
pure emotional love. 
the kind that cannot quiet Her lips
