NEVERMORE WILL THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING

do you know the glorious?
do you know they breathe and live?
the strict attention that they give
toward their competition
is comparable to any domiant country
that exists today
not allowing their alertness
to be distracted while they take
what they want
your actions are useless
the appalled know
not to question or act our
toward the glorious in a harmful manner
the result woudl disastrous
eighter side you choose
can be negative or positive
so I appalled walk away
with their eyes closed
and mouths gaping open
trying to take in each breath
they can as they walk away
they never question them
they never even think twice about it
and all we here is his born
you can hear him strain
as the pitch retreats
deeper into a gloom monotone note
there is a sudden silence
which consumes the crowd
a second later
faces start to grow old with age
stress soaks eyes
with a foggy coat of depression
lips wrinkled
as the air grows bitterly cold
I am running
trying not to look back
leaping over fallen bodies
and seeking shelter from this living hell
