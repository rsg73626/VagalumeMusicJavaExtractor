THE CHANGE CAME SUDDENLY

can I spread frustration
without speaking?
without parting my lips
except to breath?
I let my actions speak for me
because my words
collided with yours
it created tension and frustration
so I left
I didnt turn around to see
how troubled you were that night
I promise that it paled in comparison
to the anguish each step brought me
as I walked away
my heart pumps your rhapsody
I still lick my lips
to the thought of you
so now im stuck here
in the purgatory of longing
for that one kiss good-bye
I try to empty myself
of all desire that I crave for ou
but the attempt only brings me
to my knees
I succumb to you idol
this subconscious social vampire
who haunts everythought
I chock on the will to demand patence
only to find myself swallowing blood
