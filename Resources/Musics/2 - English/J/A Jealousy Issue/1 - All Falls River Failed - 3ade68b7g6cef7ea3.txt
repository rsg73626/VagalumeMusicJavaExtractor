ALL FALLS RIVER FAILED

A falls river farewell. 
Sometimes I sing by myself.
Alone, away from the angels that hold my hand. 
as I walked way scared. 
from the memories that I choked on. 
memories of you. 
wiping them away with glass. 
angels sing songs about you. 
they bleed in my dreams bringing those memories of you alive. 
as the angels fall to their knees. 
their wings were torn in my dreams. 
my eyes were torn to shreds.
