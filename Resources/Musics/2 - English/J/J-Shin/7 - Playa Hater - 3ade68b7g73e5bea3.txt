Playa hater

See I don't know why

Playa
Why oh why?
I don't know why
So check it out, check it out

Sitting home one night just thinking about it
I check the clock to see the clock said twelve
See I've been out just one week
I did a year in DC jail
See you don't know the type of things I'm going through
Sometimes you in something you knew
I got the clothes, unique style and pretty girls
But what a cold, cold cruel world

Playa hater

Playa hater
Why you wanna trip on me?
See I don't know why

See times have changed
But you can't make it in this world
If you don't know the game
I can't lie
I have no fear
I'm anybody I can
This brother wanna own these

See I was raise as a young child
Fear no man, put God in your life
I hold my head now, hold my head up high
And move on, I gots to move on

I don't know why
Playas wanna hate on me
We're all the same
Respect the game

Playas wanna hate on me
We're all the same
Respect the game

Cause all around town they dropping rage
They said I'm no good

Females walking around telling their friends
They said I'm no good

See now I'm making records yes indeed
They said I'm no good
