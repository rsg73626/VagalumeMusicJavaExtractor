SLEEPIN' WITH FRIENDS

Baby, I'm sorry
For all the wrong I've did to you
What was I to do
The things you put me through
For messing up my best friend

Baby, I'm sorry
For all the wrong I've did to you
What was I to do
The things you put me through
For messing up my best friend

See you keep telling me lies
But I don't really wanna fight
You keep on listening to your friends
They tellin' you you need another man Baby
Oh, I can't take this shit no more
So get your clothes walk out that door
Cause even though you was full of pain
You shouldn't have slept with my friend

Chorus

Oh even though I'm insecure
That don't mean I'll be a fool
So save your lie for someone else
I gotta get this shit up off my chest

You was stripping in the club

You was giving it up
You were doing your thang
Sleepin' with my friend
So you can't deny
That you were hot like fire
So tell me why, Baby tell me why

Chorus

See baby you don't know (don't know)
What I've been going thru (what I've been going through)
But I refuse to do (I refuse to do)
What you want me to
You were my shorty (my shorty)
My one and only
Messing with my homie (yes you was)
So baby what was going on
(I thought you was home alone)
See I thought you was home alone

Chorus

You was stripping in the club
You was giving it up
You were doing your thang
Sleepin' with my friend
So you can't deny
That you were hot like fire
So tell me why, Baby tell me why
