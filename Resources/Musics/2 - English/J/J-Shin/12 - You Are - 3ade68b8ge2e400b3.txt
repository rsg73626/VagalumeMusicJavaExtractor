YOU ARE

You are the light within my soul
You're the breath that keeps me alive
You are the only one who make me feel alive
Say you feel my words inside your heart
Cause you're the love of my life

If you could only stay in my arms with me tonight
If it's only for one precious sleep last night

Cause I don't wanna live without your love
Oh you're all I'm dreaming of
Can't you understand? If there's no you there's no one for me
Promise that you'll never go away, that your love is here to stay
Don't you see that we were meant for you and me
Trust in me...

It took some time to understand
Broken hearts are real life
The thought of life without you I'd slowly die
I can feel your warmth inside my soul
Inside me your love takes control

If you could only stay in my arms with me tonight
If its only for one precious sleep last night

Cause I don't wanna live without your love.
Oh you're all I'm dreaming of
Can't you understand? If there's no you there's no one for me
Promise that you'll never go away, that's your love is here to stay
Don't you see that we were meant for you and me
Trust in me...

All my love I give to you
Anything for you... I'll Do!
So promise that you'll never go away
That your heart is here to stay, when I hold you close
Cause without your love I'm crying baby
If you think she'd ever come undone
Let me prove I am the one...
To love you till the end of time
Please me mine...
Oooh Ooooh Yeah
Baby...
Please be mine...
