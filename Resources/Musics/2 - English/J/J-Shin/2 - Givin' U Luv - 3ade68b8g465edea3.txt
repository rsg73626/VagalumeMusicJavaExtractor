GIVIN' U LUV

Girl, when you've lost hope
I got what'cha need
Be your fantasy
I'm diggin' your vibe
I'm diggin' your flow
I'll give it tonight
I wanna take it slowâ€¦ I'm givin' you luv
I'm givin' you what'cha want
And what'cha need

I'll hold you oh so tightly
Can't never let go
Till I hear you tell me
That you want it baby
And that you need it honey I'm givin' you luv
I'm givin' you what'cha want
And what'cha need
I run my arms around
I'll hold you oh so tightly
Can't never let go
Till I hear you tell me
That you want it baby
And that you need it honey Baby I'm sittin' here
Reminiscing on the times that we used to share
Ooh baby I miss you babe
And the things we used to do
Why you left me I can't understand
But what could I do
To make it right
See I don't wanna fuss or fight
So baby come home to me darlin'
Cause I want to make peace tonight, yeah I'm givin' you luv

And what'cha need

And that you need it honey Times have changed
I don't wanna play no more games baby
(Play no more games)
Can't maintain without your love yeah

Cause I'd climb the highest mountains from the deep sea
For you and me I'd do anything
Cause I need you, girl I want you, oh You got me saying
