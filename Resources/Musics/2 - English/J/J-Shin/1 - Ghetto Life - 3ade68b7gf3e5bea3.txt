GHETTO LIFE

Living in the ghetto 

Is the only life I know 

Living in the ghetto 

Lord have mercy on my soul 


? 

Sippin' on Hennesy 

? 

Getting back to all I know 

Cause that's how we live in the ghetto 

That's how we live in the ghe-ghetto 

Cause that's how we live in the ghetto 

Cause that's how we live in the ghe-ghe-e-tto
