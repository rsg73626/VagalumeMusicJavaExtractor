I like the rings with the gleam-gleam's in it nigga 
Six figgas or better I like my cottons spotted leather 
I ain't talking 'bout Jetta's, CLK's or better 
What I want is your tenant on point with my cheddar

Never less than a hundred grand, SHIT! 
How you playing? 
You know Trina gots plans to travel to many lands 
Baby boy I ain't playing 
You know I gotta have it all from the winter, spring, summer, fall 
Shit that's what I want

I'll get your nails done 
While you're at it get a pedicure 
I'll buy you Moschino wear 
Versacee, Donna Karen too 
Oh yes I will 
I'll be your only 
And if you hit it I'll be the other man 
Oh baby on a late night creeping 
We can do a rendezvous 
We can do a rendezvous
