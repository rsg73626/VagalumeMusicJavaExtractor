I'LL DO IT

[J-Shin:]
Yo, I'll do it babe
I'm with it babe 


[Mystic:]
I'll give you the sun and the moon 
The cars and stars 
The weed and the guards 
Hot sex in the yard when it's dark out 
Do you like Trick Daddy? 
You can call me Big Daddy 
Brick layer 
From the side a lil' slick player 
Who wanna do it all for you 
You're the one I wanna call my boo 
When it's summer, spring, fall for you 
Blockin' all my hoes calls for you 
I'll do it all for you 

[J-Shin:]
Girl there isn't anything 
That I wouldn't sacrifice 
Just to show I care for you 
You're more precious than a diamond 
So baby tell me where I stand 
Can't be no less than the only man 
You're all I ever hope for 
You're all I ever needed, I needed, I needed 

[1: J-Shin]
So if you ask
Baby we can get it
I'll pay your bills, your car

Know girl I'm with it
Whatever you want
There's no limit
There's no limit on you
And the things I will do 

[2: J-Shin]
I'll do it babe
I'm with it babe
I'm gonna do it babe
I'll do it babe
I'll do it babe
I'm with it babe
I'm gonna do it babe
I'll do it babe 

[J-Shin:]
I'll give you what you want and more
I'll open up so many doors
There's so much I wanna do
I wanna spend my life with you

[3: J-Shin]
I'll do it for you baby 
Said I'll do it for you baby 
I'll do it for you baby 
Said I'll do it for you baby 
I'll do it for you baby 
Said I'll do it for you baby 
I'll do it for you baby 
Said I'll do it for you baby
