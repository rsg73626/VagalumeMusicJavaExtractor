ONE NIGHT STAND

You say you’re havin’ my baby 

But I don’t know if it’s mine (I don’t know, I don’t know) 

It all started from a one night stand 

It wasn’t part of the plan 


But now I see you got an attitude 

And you’re so confused 

You didn’t tell me ‘bout your man at home (Oh, yeah) 

So what you gonna do (Tell me now) 


Chillin’ in the club on a Saturday night 

Saw you across the bar you were lookin’ so fly 

I can’t believe that you were also looking my way (Yes, you were, yes, you were) 

So I step to you with my game down tight (Yes, I did) 

Before we knew it was on for tonight 

So now tell me what’s goin’ on wit’ you, lady, oh, yeah 


So tell me what’s goin’ on (Tell me) 

Please don’t make me wait 

I know you’re livin’ wit’ your man (Livin’ wit’ your man) 

Sleepin’ wit’ you man (Sleepin’ wit’ your man) 

Creepin’ wit’ your friends (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah) 

Now you wanna blame it on me 


You say you’re havin’ my baby 

But I don’t know if it’s mine 

It all started from a one night stand 

It wasn’t part of the plan 


But now I see you got an attitude 

And you’re so confused 

You didn’t tell me ‘bout your man at home 

So what you gonna do 


Listen, now boy, you know just as well as I do 

In order to go half on a baby, it takes a two, yes it does, yes it does, yes it does 

And even though I had a man at home 

All we ever did was fuss and fight, things just wasn’t right 

Sick and tired of being mistreated, neglected for no reason 

When love was what I needed, he didn’t care, so I cheated, yeah 

So this is what’s goin’ on {Oh, baby} 

Baby girl, please don’t play 

I know you’re livin’ wit’ your man 

Sleepin’ wit’ you man, huh 

Creepin’ wit’ your friends 

Now you wanna blame it on me 


Say you’re havin’ my baby 

But I don’t know if it’s mine 

It all started from a one night stand 

It wasn’t part of the plan 


But now I see you got an attitude 

And you’re so confused 

You didn’t tell me ‘bout your man at home 

So what you gonna do 


See, I know it was never meant to be 

You and me 

But it’s so hard, so hard for me to believe 

That I’m havin’ your baby and it’s drivin’ me crazy, yeah 


Okay now, I’mma step up a be a real man 

But you have to really tell me where I stand 

‘Cause if it is mine {It’s yours}, girl, I’m ready {Are you ready} 

To take responsibility {Oh, my baby} 


Say you’re havin’ my baby 

But I don’t know if it’s mine (I don’t know, I don’t know if it’s mine) 

{I’m so confused, I don’t know what to do} 

It all started from a one night stand {One night stand} 

It wasn’t part of the plan {No, no, no, no, no, no, no}

And you’re so confused (And yore’ so confused) 

You didn’t tell me ‘bout your man at home (Tell me about your man at home) 

So what you gonna do {I don’t know, I don’t know, baby} 


Say you’re havin’ my baby 

But I don’t know if it’s mine
