WHAT CHU WANT

Still bangin'
Keep the record playin'
Coast to coast
Keep the record playin'
North, south, east, west
Keep the record playin'
Coast to coast
Keep the record playin'
North, south, east, west

[hook: kulaia]
Couldn't wait to give you what you want
J wess told ya that the best has yet to come
Got you shook (shook), and now he's got you stunned
He just couldn't wait to give you what you want, hey

Let's go

[kulaia]
Saw ya picture in a magazine
It's a photograph, in the music scene
Looking at-tacked, feeling bad
All's found, who's sound
I'm a puppet, yea
Pull my strings, soothing movement
Make me dance
Yea, i'll dance for you

[lolly]
Yo, ask anyone out there, lolly's no joke
When my stuff hits stores, everybody go broke
Want rhymes, got me, plus digga to speak
Want beats, got j wess bringin' the heat
Want fine chicks too, got me and kulaia
An air tight camp couldn't be any flyer
I'm sick of pop songs all sounding alike
So i've gotta work hard, put it down on the mic

Couldn't wait to give you what you want
J wess told ya that the best has yet to come

[kulaia]
Looking back to my history
In a mystery, how it came to me
A little money and a lotta time
I gave all that's mine, and now i got my sign
Ohhh, i'm not your puppet
Don't pull my strings, fool with this
I'll make you, yea yea yea
Dance for me

[digga]
Ring the alarm, coz j we
