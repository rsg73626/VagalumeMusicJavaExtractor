LIVE THE LIFE (FEAT. ADAM LAMBERT)

Bang it out, bottoms up
Break it down, roll it up
Paint it on, pack it in
Lace it up, let's begin
Raze the day, grab your toys
leave the past, you girls and boys
Turn on
Tune In
Drop Out

If you see it
If you feel it
If you want it
If you need it

You've got to live the life
Live the life
You've got to live the life
Live the life

World class, VIP
Velvet rope, luxury
Jet set, Vegas lights
New York, London, Paris nights
So lap it up, suck it in
3 or 4, skin to skin
Turn on
Tune In
Drop Out

If you see it
If you feel it
If you want it
If you need it

You've got to live the life
Live the life
You've go to live the life
Live the life
