WHY

Why close eyes on the nights of thunder?
Why cry in the rain?
Why smile on sunny days?
Why get bored on Sundays?
Why listen to the same music?
Why watch the same movie?
Why be sorry?
Why? I say this because
Why get angry?
Why love?
Is it because we are alive?
Because we are human?
Must be why we have feelings
Why fear? If God is on our side?
Why cry? If we smile?
Why be the same routine? Can we innovate?
Why talk? If you can sing?
Why apologize? If we can fix it?
Why hate? If we can love?
Why give up living? If life is beautiful
But why even though
what will happen still insist?
Why talk? Instead of hearing?
Why cry? If we can speak softly?
Why love? Because we will be rewarded
So why complicate things so much?
Why become difficult?
Why is nothing simple?
Because we love,
love is our biggest mistake
and our best decision
Made by our heart.
