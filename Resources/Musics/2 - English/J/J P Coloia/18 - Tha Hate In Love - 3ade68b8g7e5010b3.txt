THA HATE IN LOVE

Love and hate go together
Hand in hand
Walking at the crossroads
I love so much that I started to hate

And I get a lot of hate in love
Without one the other will never appear
Hatred begets love
But the hatred born of love
The two together at all
The hatred is jealousy in love

Love Hate is the envy
Hatred begets love
But hatred born of love
The two together at all
I love so much that I started to hate

And I get a lot of hate in love
The heart insists on denying
Which can simultaneously
Someone to love and hate
I love so much that I started to hate
And I get a lot of hate in love

Love and hate go together
Hand in hand
Walking at the crossroads
To all those who try to hide
Also shown

The love that comes from hatred
The hatred born of love
I love so much that I started to hate
And I hate so much that I learned to love (3x)
