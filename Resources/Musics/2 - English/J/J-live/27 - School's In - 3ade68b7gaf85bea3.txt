SCHOOL'S IN

Welcome 
to the voice response registration system 
of True School University 
representing universally 
you have added 
hip hop ethics 
one two zero 
for those that don't know 
school's in 

who got the nerve ta 
write a jam that you can swerve ta 
over tracks so fat the nickname Big Bertha 
It's probably the kid that half the crews have never hearda 
whose mind travels further 
than sex drugs and murder 
so when you play the role of the timeless inserter 
I'm sorry if you're 85 and you would have preferred a 
album full of ignorance 
the place is an experience 
before the reasons why 
for the sake of sounding fly 
but I 
grade your style without the curve 
cuz you don't deserve to 
receive the grade that might let you build up the nerve to 
bite the rhyme that feeds you 
I need you to listen 
my words are whet with crystal-clear wisdom so they glisten 
and I fill in the blanks for all the answers that you're missing 
I'm rolling with the mongoose, cuz snakes is steady hissing 
to expose my flaws like salt in sores 
since they cannot be reformed I simply kill 'em by the fours 
so in other words, nah man, skip the explanation 
see that what the rewind's for, so be patient 
cuz this is the direction that my pen should be draggin' 
to transform your dollar cabs into bandwagons 

Chorus: 
J-Live with the mic is like a chef with a blade 
no doubt 
man I cut ya like lumber 
(repeat) 

you see somewhere in between the old school and the new school 
a master of the next school 
came to teach the now school 
cuz business class was steady playing old tricks on new fools 
so everybody rocks jewels, but can't nobody drop jewels 
one-track-minded, blinded, thinking only pop's cool 
supply & demand rules, replaced by A&R rules 
a scholar of the next school 
who wasn't trying to hear that 
so principals and teachers abroad began to fear that 
"If this guy makes an impact on the students that we play, 
they'll end up having way too much control over their grades!" 
see grades will equal status for power, so just like college 
you're so caught up in letter grades, you skip the 'F'ing knowledge 
(I didn't get this line -- I know I'm missing something) 
so when the listener 
graduates to be an artist 
you still enslaved by the principles because they're heartless 
first they make you imitate another man's skill 
now you use your power for another man's will 
move the crowd's mental when they tell you sit still 
move the crowds pockets instead to get the bread 
yeah that's what the students gather from what the principal said 
they make you think the world bleeds green instead of read 
but class is in session now so all that stuff is dead 
I'm coming through with knowledge and wisdom to fill your head 

Chorus: 
J-Live with the mic is like a chef with a blade 
no doubt 
man I cut ya like lumber 
(repeat X 3) 

"now wait a minute 
what the hell does chopping trees have to do with culinary?" 
that's the spirit kid, analyse the lyric 
from the moment that you hear it, see, cuz most don't have the skill to 
utilize their ears' function as a garbage filter 
so their brain gets clogged and congested 
by the time and the effort that's invested in illusion 
and by the time's definition of reality 
by the time you get the facts, they're outnumbered in confusion 
so I come, to get shit off my chest and up in you 
and I come, to make you feel at home with your power 
and I come, to plant seeds of responsibility 
cuz I come, harder than a sleepless cold shower 
refining and refreshing 
reprimanding 
those who claim they're representing by demanding 
clarity 
cuz when a mouthfull don't equal an eyefull, an earfull sound awful 
at least that's how it seems to me 
so I lead by example in my sound-proof room 
and the comp gets trampled on my wack-proof stage 
and my answers be ample in the packed classroom 
cuz my thoughts are reflected on an ink-filled page
