HUSH THE CROWD

Verse 1: 
MC's out there how deep does the underground get? 
Deep engough to set up the upset 
With your dream and aspirations personal status across the nation 
That only leads to the aggravation of realizing thee exaggerate 
The stakes when your the best on the block 
You got the whole world locked 
Thinkin' lyrics get you over leave you sadly mistaken 
When lyricist are brought to the rude awakening 
That just cause your flavor is phat 
Doesn't mean your Tasters Choice 
If the crowd doesn't recognize your voice 
So new jacks feel the sad truth the proof 
Now you can have the best beat and the illest flow 
A dope crew with the full proof stage show 
But it your jams what the followers don't know 
You ain't gettin' no love from the crowd bro 
Is that justice when you come correct like a-yo bust this 
And heads be like "Who the fuck is this" -B.I.G.-Warning 
But when the same records on the play list 
The last shall be first and the least likely to get dissed 
Now it might of been a while but ain't a damn thing changed 
From the opening acts to the solid gold wax 
But these are the facts when you gotta wait your turn on line 
So let me show you one way to kill time 

Hook: 
Cause this is for the heads that' on some next shit 
(NEXT SHIT) Noboy reocognize till the next hit (NEXT HIT) 
You gotta hush the crowd (HUSH THE CROWD) 
I said hush the crowd (HUSH THE CROWD) 
A-yo this is for the heads that's on some next shit 
(NEXT SHIT) But nobody recognize till it's the next hit (NEXT HIT) 
You gotta hush the crowd (HUSH THE CROWD) 
It don't matter when they ain't gettin' loud (HUSH THE CROWD) 

Verse 2: 
A-yo how many times have you seen it? 
The local boy makes good around your hood 
With the style you couldn't knock uless you tried it 
But gettin' props is a whole nother mission 
Because crowd participation is bore of attrition 
See time is the person that you have to sift through 
Cause you just an act people have to sit through 
Before the show stoppers pay twice as much as you 
But frankly guess who the crowd came to see 
Especially the ones who showed up two hours early 
Just to pack up the front put yourself in they shoes 
We ain't got time for new jacks trying to pay dues 
You lose because I got the dialect blues 
You're unknown just like them 50,000 other crews 
So I'm a either play the back or you can hear the boos 
So when you wondering why it's so quiet you hearin' crickets 
I'm saving my energy for the names on the ticket 
Matter of fact a-yo you best to shorten up your show 
I paid my doe to see the pros flow 
My man in the back got plenty of pennys to throw 
And now you askin' me to say "ho" oh hell no but that's why

Verse 3: 
So let's see as we break this down logically we confirm premiscy 
The crowd wants to murder ya because they never heard of ya 
But do you quit it wishing you never would of did it 
Or say committed and come with it 
Well I prefer the latter cause time fly and if your dope 
You get a deal and watch your pockets get fatter 
And if your wack you'll probably get a deal anyways 
Cause now a days come on look around it don't matter 
Besides what's your options put you hard work up for adoption 
And climb back down from the middle of the ladder 
I rather break the mics and the lights and lick a shot up in the air 
Just to watch the crowd scatter 
But naw cause then you mess it up for the few true 
Hardcore heads to give credit where the credit is due 
Guarentee that if you keep it dedicated to them 
They'll turn around and dedicate it you like yo
