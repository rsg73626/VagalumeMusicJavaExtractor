Or straight through your own home system (aight)
So just sit back, relax; or stand up and get busy

Do what you feel, (aight) feel what you do (true)
And enjoy... [applause]

"live on the fader" "j-live on the fader"
"all of the above'll be, caused by me"
(..is what this album is all about...)
"bust this..."

[j-live: x3]
Peace, y'all! (peace y'all)
Peace, y'all! (peace y'all)
Pe-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-deece, y'all! (peace y'all)

Pe, da-dee, pe-pe, da-dee
Pe-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-deece, y'all!

First things first, i just - got through, goin through
This ordeal, dealin with deals, you know the deal
I've dealt with, bein dealt dirty, downsized
And duped, done double-paid my dues, for real
I just - know today's degree, c lesson
Not nowadays, can a record label fool me
So the understanding'll be 'the best part'
No need to guess how this rocky road was meant to be
I just - got home from a long tour
Seashore to seashore, j-live up the party
So, even if i'm unknown back home (say what)
Step out of the time zone, these folks came to see me!
I just - grab the mic, jump on the stage
Soak up the crowd, hittin 'em with page after page of
Blood, sweat, tears, saliva, sperm, snot
Shit, piss, throw-up, everything i got!
I just - let it all out, give it all back
Like i got it, why? cause i got it like that
I've been spotted by those that recognize the fact that
God is still black and bullshit is still wack! (wack!)

[j-live: x3]
Peace, y'all! (peace y'all)
Peace, y'all! (peace y'all)
Pe-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-deece, y'all! (peace y'all)

Pe, da-dee, pe-pe, da-dee
Pe-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-deece, y'all!
