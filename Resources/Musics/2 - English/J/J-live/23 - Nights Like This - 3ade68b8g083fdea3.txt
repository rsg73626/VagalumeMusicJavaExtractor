NIGHTS LIKE THIS

[Rokafella singing]
Oooohhh... yeaaahhh... 
You're living in your zooone...
Ohhhh-ooohh... comes through on nights like this... yyeah

[J-Live] [Rokafella harmonizing in background]
Yo... soon as the sun sets (Nah-nah) 
Soon as the Earth's side reflects the light (Nah, nah, nah)
Soon as the sun sets my part of the Earth on its backside,
Sayin you can call it a night
I get a rush like a bird's eye view of the city at the clock-die
When the street lights ignite
Cuz by then I'm getting gamblin out of the greed
It seems easy as the 1 to the 1 to the 3 times 3
I know a man that know a man that know the author
That sent a ripple through time
To let me know the author was me
I write my own rhyme book of vignettes
Autobiological and I ain't done yet
The sun set means sun rise on the other side of things
Showing you equalities, so follow me to the lead
Together we can set our speed, reignite the seeds
You know how many had to bleed just so you could read?
Fuck weed, what you need, is a night like this
To put things in perspective
The sights before you, 1 before 2
It's simple as old before new
So if you frontin like you knew before you knew,
Welcome back to what's true

[Rokafella]
When you're in your zooone
As if you're all aalooone
It's just that conscious lives...
Comes through on nights like thiiiss

[J-Live]
Yeah... nights like this, I don't wish for rain drops
No need to anticipate
My words hold enough weight to make it percipitate
The baron I fertilize, the crooked I set em straight
In simulcast, watch me hold it down and levitate my mindstate
From Florida to Washington, from Cali to Maine
From a state of frustration that'll make you complain
To a state of calm where you can enjoy the rain
From the sight, to the sound, to the feel, to the taste 
To the place where you know you can set your own pace
Enter at your own reward 
It's called knowledge of self 
Leave without it, you won't leave a trace in the stars
No matter who you are, no matter what you got
No matter what you will or what you're not
No matter over mind, son, it's mind over matter
So never mind the chatter at the bottom of the ladder
That's the bottom of the 8th, let the bottom feeders hate
Feed the love to the babies, not the love of Mercedes
But the love of a night like this
Filled with cool peeps, chilled drinks and life lessons
Cuz as soon as the sun sets you know you're back to the Earth
There won't be hours put into seconds for second guessin
Four legs, two legs or three legs, why spend the last leg pissed?
When you can spend it on nights like this

[Rokafella]
When you're in your zooone
As if you're all aalooone
It's just that conscious lives...
Comes through on nights like thiiiss

When you're in your zooone
As if you're all aalooone
It's just that conscious lives...
Comes through on nights like thiiiss

Comes through on nights like this...
