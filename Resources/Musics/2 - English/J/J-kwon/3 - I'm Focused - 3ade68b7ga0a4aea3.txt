[J-Kwon: Verse 1] (Dissin Mike Jones & Paul Wall)

I touch your eyez, and look whose scared wit a mug on the hand bug you muck
You can’t stay wit a muck
You ain’t supreme mothafucka I ain’t talkin’ about weed
Like Mike Jones record work always sells clothes to a fiend
I’ma bout to wait and stuff clean wit a LA teen
You ask why the alone things I see in my dream
I ain’t dream all these excitement said everything
From the satter and batter and shattered that close to a scene
You know what I seen just like hatin and then they anger wit me
Before some case know they method do away wit my feet
It ain’t a scheme, mothafucka more like jello the courtroom
