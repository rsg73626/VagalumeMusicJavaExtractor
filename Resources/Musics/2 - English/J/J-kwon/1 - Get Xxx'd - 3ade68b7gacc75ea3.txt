Come Take A Ride As We Roll Thru The Ghetto 
But Keep Your Feet On The Pedal Cuz It Can Get Pretty Extreme In The Ghetto
Tripple XXX Level No Hold Bar We Got Hood Capped & Lutenets & Project Sergeants
Capable Of Pullin Your Car Bombin Your Car Grenades Through Your Windows
This Is all out war Take The Main Road Eerwhere We Go Every Time We Roll 
Have Me Transportin Guns Stashed In The Truck Flow
Real Talk Dogg I Hit Real Hard One Swing Knock A Motha Fucka Block Slam Off
Hit Him In The Part Where He Talk From 
Now he Got A Momma Cuz The wires In The Jaw Make It Hard For Him To Tell You Somethin 
It's Sunny Now But The Storm Comin 
The Best Thing For You To Do Is Try To Get Prepared For It
They Find Him Bread Water Milk A Couple Cans Of Soup
And A Place To Go Just In Case You Had To Move
