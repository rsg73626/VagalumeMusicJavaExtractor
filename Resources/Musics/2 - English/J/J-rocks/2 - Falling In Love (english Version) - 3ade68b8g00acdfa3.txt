FALLING IN LOVE (ENGLISH VERSION)

I think I'm in love for the first time
And it's makin my heart confused
Tell me what exactly happened
How I wonder it will be

You touching my heart and my soul
While you hands in my hand indeed
Tell me what exactly happened
Make me feel I'm drowning to deep
Seems weird for me
I will never let this feeling go

If you are mine
Sharing all our up and down
I'm gonna be around and forever it would be

[REFR√ÉO]Coz I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love
Yes I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love
Yes I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love with you

You touching my heart and my soul
While you hands in my hand indeed
Tell me what exactly happened
Make me feel I'm drowning to deep
Seems weird for me
I will never let this feeling go
