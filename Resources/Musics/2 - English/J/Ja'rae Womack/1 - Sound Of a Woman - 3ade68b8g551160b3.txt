SOUND OF A WOMAN

It's the sound of a woman, writing down her pain
And it's the sound of a woman callin' out yo name
And t's the sound of yo woman, drivin' you insane
Crave (?), and it's the sound of a woman
Fed up from being chained
Games

Ya left stranded for days
I don't know what ya askin' for
And I can't seem to forget
The way you left me all afraid (?)

Is that what you want, cuz that's what you got
And are you done tellin' me
About what more do I have yo give
You, you took all I feel, you got all of this
