THAT GIRL

That Girl.

You broke Upwith me
And I’m not so happy
But I know I’m wrong 
And  I am guilty .

But My love
Is trying to put myself thru
And my heart 
Just try to find a way back to you.

I’ll make you a phone call 
And try to excuse
Ask you to forget it all
Cause my feeling is huge

Than I’ll try 
To make you want to come back to me
And if I get it I’ll fly
And see a blue sky, deep blue sea.

I’m a heart slave
And I can’t stoop my tears
I’m a free man
But My heart just can’t see

Ask  my heart
To please set me free
Cause I’d die 
Wanting THAT GIRL that loves me!
