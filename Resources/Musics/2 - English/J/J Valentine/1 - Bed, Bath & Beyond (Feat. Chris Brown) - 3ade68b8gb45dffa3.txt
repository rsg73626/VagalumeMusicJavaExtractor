BED, BATH & BEYOND (FEAT. CHRIS BROWN)

Oh, this is for my baby doll, this is for my baby doll!
Turn it up and down
Baby, bring your body on down, down, down
Turn it up and down, down, down
Baby, bring your body on down, down, down
I'm looking at you like you's a star
Cause you're shining in the dark
Go on and tell me every day with her
I go there and?
Giving you what you deserve!

I'll do anything that I say I would
Making your body feel, like you never could
If you follow me, girl I swear I won't lead you on,
When we get home!

I'm gonna let you down, turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby form the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it!
I'mma hit the spot till you can't tickle, more
Going in, like I never ever did before
From the bed to the bath and beyond!
However you like it, girl!
I bet you never had a man like me,
That's gonna make your body feel this way
I'll pull you closer even when you say no
So baby, let me take control now!

I'll do anything that I say I would
Making your body feel, like you never could
If you follow me, girl I swear I won't lead you on,
When we get home!

I'm gonna let you down, turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby form the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it!
I'mma hit the spot till you can't tickle, more
Going in, like I never ever did before
From the bed to the bath and beyond!
However you like it, girl!
I know you ..on the bed
We can stay here on the floor
We don't need no luxury
Just put your naked body on!
You know I like it when your hair gets wet
Girl, I'm gonna turn this shower on
So let's reinvent love making
I'll drive you crazy!

I'm gonna let you down, turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby form the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it!
I'mma hit the spot till you can't tickle, more
Going in, like I never ever did before
From the bed to the bath and beyond!
However you like it, girl!
