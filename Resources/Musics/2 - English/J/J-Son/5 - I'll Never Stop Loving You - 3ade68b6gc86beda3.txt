I'LL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU

VERSE 1:

They say in this world nothing lasts forever
But I don't believe that's true
Cause the way that I feel when we're together
I know thats the way, I'll always feel for you

CHORUS:

From now until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I will make you this vow
and promise you now
until forever, i'll never stop loving you

VERSE 2:

There'll come a day when the world stops turning
and stars will fall from the sky
but we will still last
when the sun stops burning
all i wanna do is love you
until the end of time

REPEAT CHORUS

It's gonna take more than a lifetime
to give you all the love
all the love i feel for you tonight

REPEAT CHORUS

From now until forever...(until fade out)
