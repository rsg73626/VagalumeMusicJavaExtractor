WHO IS HE

Yeah walked out of his home, different time zone
Lives in eternity, now he's living in time zones?
This is mind blowin, god of the universe
Knows every star in the sky to my human hurts
Made the trees, made the breeze
Made the seas, emcees like j and me
But let me tell you what amazes me
How he came as a man who was made to need
Hungered and thirsty, and the very same earth that he cursed
He's now fully immersed in
Look at his work he's god to be exalted
But he came and lived with people falling and faulted
I hope you get it homes
Only a god who's perfect in love would ever
Leave his throne for some skin and bones
It's hard to live breathing to death
When the same god that made you is breathing your breath

Who is he?
God in the flesh who was tested
Who came manifested was killed, resurrected
Who are you?
Do you even know who you are?
Created to know the god who created the stars
Who is he?
He was, he is, he will be
Death couldn't hold him and neither shall death seal me
Who are you?
You better of never existing 
if you don't trust the god of the scriptures
You listenin?

Can you imagine god in the flesh invisible seen as visible
Infinite seeming finite spirit becoming physical
Its odd man god man slept and obeyed
The earths confines to breathe the very breath that he made
He would sweat
He would weep
Even eat
For his hunger
Defeat death
Within three
So we'd see
That he's stronger
Could give us anything even offer us wealth
That wouldn't be love if he ain't offer himself
So he stepped down
From his throne and removed his crown
And touched ground
Even though he knew he would be bruised and bound
He is that was then next and later on
And still is what me and crae can't convey in this song
Though, our minds can never reason his fame
The question is do you really see him the same?
And if you see him the same, 
as the living god and matchless christ
How much do these tunes impact your life?

Who is he?
God in the flesh who was tested
Who came manifested was killed, resurrected
Who are you?
Do you even know who you are?
Created to know the god who created the stars
Who is he?
He was, he is, he will be
Death couldn't hold him and neither shall death seal me
Who are you?
You better of never existing 
if you don't trust the god of the scriptures
You listenin?
