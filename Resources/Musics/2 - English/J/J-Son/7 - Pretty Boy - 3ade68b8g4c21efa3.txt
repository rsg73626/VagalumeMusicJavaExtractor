You can never win why pretend you got it hermano
I never said im the best just represent for my set
Rollin up lookin good and they get wexed she let you wait a couple months til you get sex
While hit it on the first night first night
She be hollerin like err-night err night
If I call her she be on the first flight
Wanna have my baby be my wife
But I wouldnt have that I can only
Tap that then I send it right back
Partna you can have that
I run through ladies
Like a quarterback black
Still homie see me and be givin me dap
Hat, on the lean a twist of philipine
Mixed with african latina my brova
Know what I mean never trade pussy for cream
Green budha what I steam im clean
You lookin mean cause this player is a dream
