GOON

You are not a goon
That's not why he created you
He made you for his glory
In his image and his likeness

Streets they shake me raise me 
made me all about the fetti dough
Feds I go the cosh and never know when I'ma let it go
Me and my eyes got the kush to the fire
Fractured on my side down to push, I'm a rider
This is all I know, do whatever for the cake
Keep the fitty pulled low, you tell a felon by his face
My dream was movin' weight, thinkin' money over anything
Finna sell some dope man before we rock them skinny jeans
See me and my cup, thinkin' what, livin' life it's fast as a race
At 16 my homie galen lost half of his face
Had your boy in gold, he over rippin' big
Had to support the habit, now I'ma stick again
Wasn't young and unashamed, I'd rather die in the game
The streets remember my name, with little fortune and fame
All that I'm sayin' I done been in ya shoes
And in ya tombs now I'm yellin' to dudes ...

You are not a goon
That's not why he created you
He made you for his glory
In his image and his likeness
Lil homie I was you
Grindin' for that chain that fame that payback
Lost it with that vain that pain to save me
Till christ came and made and changed me
No homie you are not a goon

I hit the block at 16, in the gut supreme
My only dream, to put a brick up on the triple beam
So I hit the hood hard, tryna make the cream
My mindset, to get more paper than I'd ever seen
I told the homie fast, we bout to make it move
The hood made me crazy, full-blooded goon
My back against the wall, I didn't know what to do
Thought I was really winnin', but I was bout to lose
(fast forward) learned I was made for worship, that 
I was made with purpose
Thought I was livin' but I hadn't even scratched the surface
Learned I was made in his image, that's what it do
That's why I'm here talkin' to you, no homie you are not a goon

You are not a goon
That's not why he created you
He made you for his glory
In his image and his likeness
Lil homie I was you
Grindin' for that chain that fame that payback
Lost it with that vain that pain to save me
Till christ came and made and changed me
No homie you are not a goon

God made you in his image, not here to model men
Ogs they may have raised you, but he made you to model him
Your heart beats for the streets, homie I feel your grind
Heartbeats for the streets, the son lived and died
Rides to get you peace, so why ride with the streets?
Life your life as a goon, die and face god who's a beast
We rep god over beats, hope the hood get it soon
He knew you from the womb to the tomb
You wouldn't need to be a goon

You are not a goon
That's not why he created you
He made you for his glory
In his image and his likeness
Lil homie I was you
Grindin' for that chain that fame that payback
Lost it with that vain that pain to save me
Till christ came and made and changed me
No homie you are not a goon

No homie you are not a goon
No homie you are not a goon
No homie you are not a goon
No homie you are not a goon
