DANCIN BY MYSELF

Baby I didn’t mean to call you, I was feeling low
I was thinking of the past that we was before
There was a line we shared, now it never glows
You know I’m trying to let you go
But the rain never stops coming down
I’m afraid of this road, cause it’s cold
… together, whoa
And I can’t take living without you girl
It’s a world of heart break
And I can’t take …the spotlight shine
Without you being mine

Baby, I’m dancing by myself without you, I’m dancing by myself
There’s none in the world that can move
The way that we move when we dance, when we dance
But we ain’t dancing no more
And I know that this is just a fantasy
And now just a memory
Cause now I’m stalking, dancing by myself without you
I’m dancing by myself without you,
I’m dancing by myself without you,

Don’t wanna turn to no other hoe
Nobody that can dance like you show
Get everybody on me while … and sing, oh, oh, oh, oh
No fancy cars or applause girl you’ll ever bring
The kind of joy when … to believe
Give me your hand and I promise not to …, oh, oh, oh,

And I can’t take living without your girl
It’s a world of heart break
And I can’t take …the spotlight shine
Without you being mine

Baby, I’m dancing by myself without you, I’m dancing by myself
There’s none in the world that can move
The way that we move when we dance, when we dance
But we ain’t dancing no more
And I know that this is just a fantasy
And now just a memory
Cause now I’m stalking, dancing by myself without you
I’m dancing by myself without you,
I’m dancing by myself without you,

Clear this floor, let the transport … that make me fall
I’m no more, without your …
I gotta find your rhythm, I gotta find your rhythm
…you get up, … so we can dance again, just me and you, you

Don’t you know
Baby, I’m dancing by myself without you, I’m dancing by myself
There’s none in the world that can move
The way that we move when we dance, when we dance
But we ain’t dancing no more
And I know that this is just a fantasy
And now just a memory
Cause now I’m stalking, dancing by myself without you
I’m dancing by myself without you,
I’m dancing by myself without you.
