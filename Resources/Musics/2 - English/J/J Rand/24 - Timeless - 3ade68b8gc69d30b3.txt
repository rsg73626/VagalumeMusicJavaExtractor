TIMELESS

(Verse)
Timeless, timeless
Is what we have, it will never age
Timeless, timeless
Reminds girl of our better days
And I can't find the words to say
I lost them and yesterday
Tick tock, tick tock… it's gone

(Verse)
And tonight I looked at a picture
It reminded of the past
That night she said hello mister
Would you like to drink and get trashed?
One drink turned into one too many
And one too many turned into Danny's
It's 3 o'clock, we sit and talk about Barack and Jesus

(Chorus)
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
I I I I I fell in love then
I I I I I fell in love then
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever

(Verse)
Last night I remember one thing
We were just too drunker to drive
We stayed up until the sun rose
We were so young and so alive
One night turned into one too many
And one too many became so heavy
But we forgot we had to talk about Barack and Jesus

(Chorus)
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
I I I I I fell in love then
I I I I I fell in love then
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever

(Verse)
Timeless, timeless
Is what we have, it will never age
Timeless, timeless
Reminds girl of our better days
And I can't find the words to say
I lost them and yesterday
Tick tock, tick tock… it's gone

(Chorus)
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
I I I I I fell in love then
I I I I I fell in love then
And oh oh oh
I fell in love that night forever
