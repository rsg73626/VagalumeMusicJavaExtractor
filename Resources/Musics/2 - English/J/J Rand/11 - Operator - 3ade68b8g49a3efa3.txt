OPERATOR

Chorus:
She’s that one in a million, million riding the club
Posting hard, I’m a... looking for love
She got me, got me, got me,
Call 911, 911!
Operator, operator stay on the line
I need some pill, pill, pill that goes..
Operator, operator stay on the line
I need some pill, pill, pill that goes..

You’re taking my breath away
Every move that you make
It’s an emergency I need right now!
It’s not a moment to waste
Every step, a new phase,
Closing the beat of my heart!
Take my name and I’m your baby
Cause I might just pass out
I don’t wanna play these games that
Why I’m calling out!

Chorus:
She’s that one in a million, million riding the club
Posting hard, I’m a... looking for love
She got me, got me, got me,
Call 911, 911!
Operator, operator stay on the line
I need some pill, pill, pill that goes..
Operator, operator stay on the line
I need some pill, pill, pill that goes..

So I’m in fire, I’m having trouble baby, be there tonight!
I’m a victim and I’m enjoying the pain
Take me higher, but baby save me before I see the light
..to get out of this place!
Take my name and I’m your baby
Cause I might just pass out
I don’t wanna play these games that
Why I’m calling out

Chorus:
She’s that one in a million, million riding the club

I need you right now, I can’t wait anymore
Cause if I do my heart might stop on this floor!
You got the answers, operator stay on the line,
I need some help, help, help, cause that girl is so fine, fine, fine!

Baby, operator can you save me?
Save me! This girl is a problem, I can’t help, is crazy!
Leave me on the other side,
If I don’t might get in time, I think I’m losing my mind!
