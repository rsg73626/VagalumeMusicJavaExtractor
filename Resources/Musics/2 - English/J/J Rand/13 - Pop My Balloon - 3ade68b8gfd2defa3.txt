POP MY BALLOON

2012 could have been today, could have been tomorrow
Sometimes love’s gotta face it, the women gone and blown away
Now the air we crawl, through the hole, you the faded baby
I can see the planes and birds flying above all, … and keep
I can see the sunset fall, but now I fall

Cause you popped my balloon
I was floating away, away to the moon
And then you came along, yeah you popped my balloon
I can see the ground, I ‘m falling over you
The sky is spinning round, cause you popped my balloon

I really thought I had it all figured out
And then you came, like a spot light in the crowd
And baby I know, so baby I know
That change is gonna come, but you really never know how
I … out of the blue, what could I do?
Cause now I’m falling with no parachute

Cause you popped my balloon
I was floating away, away to the moon
And then you came along, yeah you popped my balloon
I can see the ground, I ‘m falling over you
The sky is spinning round, cause you popped my balloon

Yeh, I must feel so … no clouds I have no fear
I’ma keep on falling for you, are you … you

I really thought I had it all figured out
And then you came, like a spot light in the crowd
I was floating away, away to the moon
And then you came along, yeah you popped my balloon
I can see the ground, I ‘m falling over you
The sky is spinning round, cause you popped my balloon
Cause you popped my balloon.
