RIDE (FEAT. FLO RIDA, T-PAIN)

Girl, you gotta move it, (move it) shake it (shake it)
All over the back
When she do it, she do it
Down and Cardigans on her fast
Come on girl, we got somewhere to be
Now tell your homegirl
That you're leaving with me

And we gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon' ride

Three in the morning, we're so twisted
Body talkin' that shit girl
You know I'm listening
Hey, my heart's racing
Gotta catch my breath girl
I'm tryna tell you
That I really need your lovin', come on

I'mma take you to my spot, spot
We're first to call the shots

You gotta move it (move it) shake it (shake it)
All over the back
When she do it, she do it
Down and Cardigans on her fast
Come on girl, we got somewhere to be
Now tell your homegirl
That you're leaving with me

And we gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon ride

Where's your heart now?
Don't need nobody
Cuz I'm hooked on you
Girl on that body
Hey baby what are you thinkin'
Cuz I'm just ready to go
I know you came with your friends
Well we should just leave the floor

I'mma take you to my spot spot
We're first to call the shots

You gotta move it (move it) shake it (shake it)
All over the back
When she do it, she do it
Down and Cardigans on her fast
Come on girl, we got somewhere to be
Now tell your homegirl
That you're leaving with me

And we gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon' ride

Hey you fuck, you suck, got my worst theme
I know you ready for this championship ring
That's why I need a little
They can show the army
Feelin' dirty, I'm tryna see yo knees clean
Yep, I know you're kind
You'll fake it, never must see 69
Tryna get ahead so I been on my grind
About three legs
So I won't waste yo time
Walk up in the spot, don't test me
Oh she's so sexy
Kiss from the side, enough to impress me
Big me strong, got the ball, come fetch me
Beat it out the park, be gangsta Joe Pesci
Like Hollywood then she will break a peggy
We all aim down and I'm fresh shit

You gotta move it (move it) shake it (shake it)
All over the back
When she do it, she do it
Down and Cardigans on her fast
Come on girl, we got somewhere to be
Now tell your homegirl
That you're leaving with me

Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride

We gon' ride, ride
Ride, ride
And we gon' ride

Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
