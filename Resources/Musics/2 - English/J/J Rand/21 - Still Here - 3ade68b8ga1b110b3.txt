STILL HERE

(spoken)
I'm a douche bag

One, two, many
And the night got heavy
Rolled up mint in a six four chevy
Turn the music up
Don't waste time so I fill my cup
Then I saw her dance
Daisy Dukes no pants
The way she drop it to the floor no hands

I just gotta let you know
I can make your merry go round round round

I knew right there I had ya
When I said hello
Knew I had to have ya
When you said let's go
Girl its about that time
We take it back to mine

Woah-oh-oh
Let's go-oh-oh

I woke up
With a situation next to me
I can't lie
All I'm trynna do is get her to leave
I don't know why she won't go
Put your ass in the cab right now
I don't know
Why you are still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much
Why are you still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much

Too much and we all been through it
Maybe I'm crazy but now I need some fluid
Hey need Dr. Drew
Call E call G im about to puke
And you'd think I'd learn
Try to talk but baby I'm still slurrin
And you're so down for love and I can see you want it all

I knew right there I had ya
When I said hello
Knew I had to have ya
When you said let's go

Girl its about that time
We take it back to mine

Woah-oh-oh
Let's go-oh-oh

I woke up
With a situation next to me
I can't lie
All I'm trynna do is get her to leave
I don't know why she won't go
Put your hands in the air right now
I don't know
Why you are still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much
Why are you still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much

I'm more of a relationship type of guy to be honest
Flyest white boy since Elvis
Came to get drunk, see girls, shake pelvis
I'm helpless, yes I'm selfish
Get you in the mood, let's eat some Shellfish
Uh, I'm a little freaky
All the lights on a little Kanye
All the lights off a little shawday
But I can't let you stay (beeyotch!)

I don't know
Why you are still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much
I woke up
With a situation next to me
I can't lie
All I'm trynna do is get her to leave
I don't know why she won't go
Put your hands in the air right now
I don't know
Why you are still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much
Why are you still here
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I must have drank too much
