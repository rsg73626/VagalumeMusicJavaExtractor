CAN'T SLEEP (FEAT. T-PAIN)

Bags under my eyes like 35, 
I need my black shades on me yeah
I need a disguise, feel like i'm looping, smoking
I'm so high i'm floating away, uh yeah

I'm walking slow sideways with a limp
I need a cane and i have weakest bitch, i'm a pimp
Feel like i'm hilting, now tilt it, 
I might make a sex tape today, alright

I'm pop all night and i can't get enough
I wanna go and dance forever, i'm just looking for love
I can't sleep, i don't know what tonight's gonna bring me
Cause i don't wanna close my eyes i don't wanna miss a thing
Can't sleep no dreams for me, i can't sleep, no, no, no, no, no
I can't sleep, no, no, no, no dreams for me

Pretty babes don't sleep no never
? making it all better
Two dogs can't wear no sweater, no sweater, go away, go away
I feel like ? every time i turn my head, round, round
And the holiday keeping me awake 
you seen that booty hit the ground
And she bringing it ?what is she doing now?
Dropping like boom boom boom boom paw
Uh she know what she doing, come on shawty do it
Cause every time you're moving i get stuck, but

I'm pop all night and i can't get enough
I wanna go and dance forever, i'm just looking for love
I can't sleep, i don't know what tonight's gonna bring me
Cause i don't wanna close my eyes i don't wanna miss a thing
Can't sleep no dreams for me, i can't sleep, no, no, no, no, no
I can't sleep, no, no, no, can't sleep no dreams for me
Wake up, wake up, wake up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, get up, get up
Can't sleep no dreams for me, for me

I'm pop all night and i can't get enough
I wanna go and dance forever, i'm just looking for love
I can't sleep, i don't know what tonight's gonna bring me
Cause i don't wanna close my eyes i don't wanna miss a thing

I'm pop all night and i can't get enough
I wanna go and dance forever, i'm just looking for love
I can't sleep, i don't know what tonight's gonna bring me
Cause i don't wanna close my eyes i don't wanna miss a thing
Can't sleep no dreams for me, i can't sleep, no, no, no, no, no
I can't sleep, no, no, no, no i can't sleep
Can't sleep no dreams for me, i can't sleep.
