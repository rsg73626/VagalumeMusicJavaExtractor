LOCKED OUT OF HEAVEN/LOST WITHOUT U (COVER)

Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

You bring me to my knees
You make me testify
You can make a sinner change his ways
Open up your gates cause I can't wait to see the light
And right there is where I wanna stay

Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

I'm lost without You
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love you baby

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love you baby
I love you baby
