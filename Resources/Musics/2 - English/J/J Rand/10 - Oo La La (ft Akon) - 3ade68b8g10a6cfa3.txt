OO LA LA (FT AKON)

Oh la la la la
Wee wee
Oh la la la la
Wee wee
Oh la la la la
Wee wee

Your like a little french girl
I bet her name was paris in the winter
So classy and so lavish in her (?) fur
I just wanted to grab her and just kiss her, wife her
So just (?) me now
Girl you know, you just knocked me down
Your soul forever and I'll be around
And stay down cos you are my future now

And my heart's been saving up all this lovin'
And it's reserved for you (?) if you want it
Hey so come and get it
Hey so come and get it
We can live the good life, I see it coming
You'll be my one and only woman
Hey so are you wit it
Hey so are you wit it

Oh la la la la
Wee wee (x8)

No more heart breaks
Loving you is my intention
Bringing you what is missing to you babe
Trapped in your love cage
Cos life for love is my sentence
And I'll do every minute for you baby
So just cuff me now
Girl you don't know you just locked me down
In your soul forever and I'll be around
And stay down cos you are my future now

And my heart's been saving up all this lovin'
And it's reserved for you (?) if you want it
Hey so come and get it
Hey so come and get it
We can live the good life, I see it coming
You'll be my one and only woman
Hey so are you wit it
Hey so are you wit it

Oh la la la la
Wee wee (x8)

Single ladies in the house tonight
Which one for you want a piece of my life
Single ladies in the house tonight
Which one of you leaving with me tonight
Can sing

Oh la la la la
Wee wee (x8)

And my heart's been saving up all this lovin'
And it's reserved for you (?) if you want it
Hey so come and get it
Hey so come and get it
We can live the good life, I see it coming
You'll be my one and only woman
Hey so are you wit it
Hey so are you wit it

Oh la la la la
Wee wee (x8)
