MIDDLE FINGER

Throw em up

Middle finger in the air so high
middle finger in the air so high
A ha ha ha ha
Middle finger in the air so high
middle finger in the air so high
A ha ha ha ha

Wake up and my girlfriend a psycho
I think it's that time again
Three missed calls and they all from the gang
Oh, I think I'm gonna lose my head
And I wonder if Ryan ever really listens
'cause my luck's dead and gone
So throw the one in the air when you really don't care
When you feel like it all goes wrong
Let's go!

I don't, I don't, don't know why
No matter how hard I try
Somebody's gonna get a piece of em
(Everybody put em up)

I put my middle finger up
I don't give a fuck, wanna do it
It's just been one of those days
Put my middle finger up
I don't really care how I make it
So don't take this the wrong way
Everybody throw em up oh oh oh oh
Throw em up oh oh oh oh
Throw em up oh oh oh oh
It's just been one of those days... those days

No mayo on my burger, please
is my order that hard to take? (seriously?)
My check want cash and I'm on my ass
if this music don't slap to break
So I've had enough, I'll give it up
Not caring what people think
So grab a cup and live it up
I think I'll have another drink yea yea yea

I don't, I don't, don't know why
No matter how hard I try
Somebody's gonna get a piece of em
(Everybody put em up)

I put my middle finger up
I don't give a fuck, wanna do it
It's just been one of those days
Put my middle finger up
I don't really care how I make it
So don't take this the wrong way
Everybody throw em up oh oh oh oh
Throw em up oh oh oh oh
Throw em up oh oh oh oh
It's just been one of those days... those days

Middle finger in the air so high
middle finger in the air so high
A ha ha ha ha
Middle finger in the air so high
middle finger in the air so high
A ha ha ha ha

Middle finger in the air so high
middle finger in the air so high
A ha ha ha ha
Middle finger in the air so high
middle finger in the air so high
