ALL AROUND THE WORLD (FEAT. AKON)

La la la la! J Randall!
La la la la! Akon tell them!

My heart breaks, loving is you is my intention
Bringing you what is missing to you, babe!
Tracking your love, babe!
Cause life for love is my sentence
And I'll do every minute for you, baby!

So just cast me no!
Girl you know you just locked me down
You're so forever, and I'll be around
Can't stay down
Cause you are my future now!

I've been all around the world looking for a girl like you!
La la la!
Cause I've been all around the world, looking for a girl like you!
La la la girl!
La la la!
Nothing you do
All around the world for you!
Nothing you do
All around the world for you!

Like your little french girl
I bet her name was paris ... winter
So classy and so lavish in her?
I just wanna grab and just kiss her, wife her!

So just cast me no
Girl you know you just locked me down
You're so forever, and I'll be around
Can't stay down
Cause you are my future now!

I've been all around the world looking for a girl like you!
La la la!
I've been all around the world, looking for a girl like you!
La la la girl!
La la la!
Nothing you do
All around the world for you!
Nothing you do
All around the world for you!
