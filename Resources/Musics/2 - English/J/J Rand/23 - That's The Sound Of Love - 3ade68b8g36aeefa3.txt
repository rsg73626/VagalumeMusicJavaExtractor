THAT'S THE SOUND OF LOVE

Can you hear me baby?
Baby that’s the sound of love, that’s the sound of love
Alright, alright

When you say you can’t get enough
Inside your own fire, fire
And now you shine through the heart
When there’s someone to cry for, cry for, cry for
You gonna end up in the club, when you’re balling so hard
And the only thing you want, is the one you know, you’d die for, you’d die for
And all … call the same damn number…take you under

If you hear me, baby that’s the sound of love
I’m making, baby that’s the sound of love
I can’t take it
Because it feels so … it burns so bad
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love, love, love, love
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love, love, love, love

You can’t sleep or read a thing
There’s nothing that matters
And there’s no way to call for it
When it finally happens, oh yeah
You gonna end up in the club, when you’re balling so hard
And the only thing you want, is the one you know, you’d die for, you’d die for
And all … call the same damn number…take you under

If you hear me, baby that’s the sound of love
I’m making, baby that’s the sound of love
I can’t take it
Because it feels so … it burns so bad
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love, love, love, love
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love, love, love, love

Nothing will ever be the same after you hear it, hear it
Can you hear me baby?
And one day all of tomorrows turn into forevers, oh
Baby that’s the sound of love,

Baby that’s the sound of love
I’m making, baby that’s the sound of love
I can’t take it
Because it feels so … it burns so bad
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love, love, love, love
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love,
Baby that’s the sound of love, love, love, love.
