But I can’t get a seat without ..
What am I gonna do to make this work right now
That I think that’s you, that’s you

Pre Chorus:
So just cuff me now
Girl you don’t know it’s lock me down
And you’re so forever and I’ll be around
And think down ‘cause you are my future now

Chorus:
Ooh I’m digging up like a rocket with I’m with you
And I’m digging up like a rocket with I’m with you
I’m going oh oh oh oh oh like a rocket with you

Your heart breaks loving you is my intention
Bringin you what is missin to you babe
Dropping your love can’t
‘cause life in love is my sentence and I’ll go every minute for you

Pre Chorus:
So just cuff me now
Girl you don’t know it’s lock me down
And you’re so forever and I’ll be around
And think down ‘cause you are my future now

Ooh I’m digging up like a rocket with I’m with you
And I’m digging up like a rocket with I’m with you
I’m going oh oh oh oh oh like a rocket with you
Oh oh oh oh oh like a rocket with you
