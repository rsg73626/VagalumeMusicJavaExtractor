SIMPLY AMAZING

Her head is on my chest
The sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers
And all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face
Beautiful in every way
You are, you are

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play a fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

She ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life I'm in
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing, uh
Simply amazing, simply amazing

The girl's a work of art and I can't help but stare
Got the smile like the sunset and the ocean is her hair, uh
What she do ain't fair, uh
And she know me better, than I know myself, mhm

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
Like when I said I love you for the first time
And the tears drop from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change

She ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life I'm in
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing
Simply amazing, simply amazing
