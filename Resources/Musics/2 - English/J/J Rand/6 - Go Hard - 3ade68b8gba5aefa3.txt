GO HARD

Hey, the sun don’t shine forever
But as long as it’s here
I might as well stay in the weather
Better now than never
Right on my feet as a feather
I’m pop of the night
Cause tonight I’m feeling clever, let’s go

To my label I’m a great white pipe
I got a pen and a pad and one night life, night life
It’s 3 am in the morning, I’ve finished recording
Until I get a hit and I’m touring
People over when you’re at the top
I’m watching flow from the nose bleeds
When does it stop?
It casts a shadow, bigger than Colorado
I’m here to move mountains,
The question is how go, how go?
I know I’m capable of it
The golden boy man the bell I can touch it
I shoot a Russian, I’m in the oven
Cooking some new shit up by the dozen

Go harder, go boom mama,
Go hard, I will get that money until my heart stops
Push it to the limit, I know I’m gonna be on stop
I’ma keep pulling until the beat drop
I’m a dog and I’m a dog, and I’m a dog,
And I’m a dog, and I’m a dog, and I’m a dog
Yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

Thought I would make it when I signed the G
But … is for the blast my records are on leak
So they produced in they ain’t produce it
They button pushers and I know they love the movement
… robin, there ain’t no stopping
I keep club hopping, the scene what’s popping
…records man give me a break
I’m the best you’ll ever have, a brand new Drake
A millie, a millie, I know that they feel me
Do it till it kill me, just know that I’m one in a millie
I’m … biggest mistake…
Die hard, … die hard
And I’ma smash every girl like my name is Tiger
I’m keep doing tll the … says, doctor please

Go harder, go boom mama,
Go hard, I will get that money until my heart stops
Push it to the limit, I know I’m gonna be on stop
I’ma keep pulling until the beat drop
I’m a dog and I’m a dog, and I’m a dog,
And I’m a dog, and I’m a dog, and I’m a dog
Yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

I wouldn’t be here today if I didn’t believed
… your dream…
Some think easy…cause you control your destiny
You put on for the city I put on for the count
Hey, hey, hey
You do it for the fame but I do it for the crowd
Yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
One day, one day, one day
One day on the road, stacking up money up to the ceiling
I’m chilling, not worry about hurting nobody’s feelings
My records dealing, got me counting them dollars, no cubical
Or blue collar

Go harder, go boom mama,
Go hard, I will get that money until my heart stops
Push it to the limit, I know I’m gonna be on stop
I’ma keep pulling until the beat drop
I’m a dog and I’m a dog, and I’m a dog,
And I’m a dog, and I’m a dog, and I’m a dog
Yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah.
