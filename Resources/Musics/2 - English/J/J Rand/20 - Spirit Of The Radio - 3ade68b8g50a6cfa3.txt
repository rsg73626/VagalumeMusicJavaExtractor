SPIRIT OF THE RADIO

I need a melody to move my feet,
Call the DJ and bring it back to me.

Turn me up, Lets go,
Its what i need, for my soul.
I need, I need, I need the new Gaga,
If it ain't hot then don't even bother.
Feels like I'm blown, Akon gimmie one more,
I need a hook that makes me sing Nah Nah,
Please dont let me down.
I need a melody to move my feet,
Call the DJ and bring it back to me.
Beat bang in the trunk so hard,
Turn it up and say that's my song.
I love it, When i'm my zome,
I love it, n' i don't pick my phone,
I love it, When i'm all alone,
Just me and The Spirit of the radio.

I need a melody to move my feet,
Call the DJ and bring it back to me.

Every song is so addictive, I Gotta learn all the words to it,
Got me ridin' down the highway, Switchin' lanes imma swirve with it.
Like Flo's Spin my head right round, Stick it n' move it like Boom Boom Pow,
Let me hear ya say something, say something, say something,
I need a melody to move my feet,
Call the DJ and bring it back to me.
Beat bang in the trunk so hard,
Turn it up and say that's my song.
I love it, When i'm my zome,
I love it, n' i don't pick my phone,
I love it, When i'm all alone,
Just me and The Spirit of the radio.

Call the DJ and bring it back to me.

Feel the bass in the trunk and the highs in the speaker,
Feel it in your veins, so cold, need a heater.
It's infectious In my lexus (Ayo Ayo Ay),
It makes you lose control, When your on the go,
Creeps into your soul.

It's the Spirit of the radio

I need a melody to move my feet,
Call the DJ and bring it back to me.

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ay, Ayo Ayo Ayo Ay,
Ayo Ayo Ayo Ay, Call the Dj and Bring it back to me.
