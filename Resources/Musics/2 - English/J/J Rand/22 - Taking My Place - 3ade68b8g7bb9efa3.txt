TAKING MY PLACE

Yeah I know, I know, I know
That I saw you at the mall,
You were getting at his car,
And, girl I tried to call, but you ain’t become
Do you, do you really think I don’t got eyes on the street, baby
You should be more discreet
Did you, did you really think I won’t mind
Just because I did it to you, told you it was the last time
It was the last time, girl you don’t act right
Somebody sleeping in my bed tonight
Cause you know, I didn’t wanna fight
But is she ain’t right
Somebody is taking my place and taking my baby
Baby, you’re…

I know you ain’t feeling the same
Cause when we’re making love together I can see on your face
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know you ain’t feeling the same
Cause when we’re making love together,
Girl, I feel like it’s strange
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!

Do you really think… cover ups?
You’ll be on the phone saying…
Never seen…. ever stop
Baby, you better start explaining, explaining
Even though I did with dirt I know you’re hurt with that
No excuse, so he’ll be wearing my shirt
And I know, I know someone else is sleeping in my bed
I know, I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!

I know you ain’t feeling the same
Cause when we’re making love together I can see on your face
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know you ain’t feeling the same
Cause when we’re making love together,
Girl, I feel like it’s strange
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!

When I was running the block, I didn’t want to stop
Love me like you do, cause girl, you know you have my whole love!
..can you trust him?
Does he call you “baby”, baby, baby, baby?

I know you ain’t feeling the same
Cause when we’re making love together I can see on your face
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know you ain’t feeling the same
Cause when we’re making love together,
Girl, I feel like it’s strange
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
I know, I know, someone else is taking my place!
