TELEPHONE LOVE

Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time
Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time

When you call I feel so good
Wish you were livin' in my neighborhood
So you can hang up the phone and rush on over
Take up where we left, telephone in the cover

Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time
Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line, yeah
Telephone love, you make my day every time

If anyone else could see me
They would never understand
I'm just living out my fantasy
Talk your love with my mind

Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time, yeah
Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time

Telephone love
Telephone love
Telephone love
Telephone love

Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time, yeah
Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time


Whatever you do, don't hang up, don't hang up
Just keep pouring it out till you fill my cup
I'm lost in you whenever you speak, hey
When you call my name, I feel so weak

Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time
Telephone love, you sound so sweet on the line
Telephone love, you make my day every time, every time
(Telephone love)
Every time

Telephone love, come back on the cover
(Telephone love)
Telephone love, you're so good to me
(Telephone love)
I need you desperately
Telephone lover
