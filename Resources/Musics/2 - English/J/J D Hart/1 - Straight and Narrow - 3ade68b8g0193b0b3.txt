STRAIGHT AND NARROW

There's a pathway that leads
To the heaven in the sky
It's a straight and narrow pathway
That only few can find
There's a highway that's wide
As the ocean can flow
It's the highway to the hell
Where the wicked people go

The straight and narrow pathway
That leads to paradise
Where the broad and traveled highway
That leads to your demise
When the seven seal is open
And the seven things will rise
On a white horse sent to battle
Satan and his lies

The seven angels shout
From heaven up above
As the horseman slays the devil
And the whole world shall be judged

The straight and narrow pathway
That leads to paradise
Where the broad and traveled highway
That leads to your demise

Now there's angels all around us
Trying to save our souls
We don't hear their voices
They whisper way too low
But the devil he shouts loudly
For all the world to hear
Tells us it's all good
There's nothing we should fear

The straight and narrow pathway
That leads to paradise
Where the broad and traveled highway
That lead you to the fire
The straight and narrow pathway to eternal life
Where the broad and traveled highway
That leads to your demise

Your demise
