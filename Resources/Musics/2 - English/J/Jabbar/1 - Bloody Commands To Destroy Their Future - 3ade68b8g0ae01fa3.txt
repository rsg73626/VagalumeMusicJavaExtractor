BLOODY COMMANDS TO DESTROY THEIR FUTURE

Father, 
King of darkness 
Holy berg on bloody ocean 
Lord of hidden cemeteries of children 
Coldest soul of my gray oldest forest 
Crying power of thy tearful ravens 
King of the dreadful darkness 
Commander of dark ages and sacrifice 
Golden sword of madness 
My holy sins of suicide 
The black god of the underworld 
Victorious blast of sacrifice 
Hey ! 
I speak to you father... 
I speak to you Jabbar... 
Teach me to destroy their landscapes 
Call my name upon the wrathful winds 
Summon the ashes from the gates of darkness 
Leave me in the bloody ocean 
And help me when the light has come 
Embrace me in the darkest abyssic imperials 
Jabbar ! 
The reason of my sacrifice and suicide 
Give me thy power of the sin 
Give me the veil to never see the light 
Give me your last sword to destroy children 
Give me your last sword to destroy... 
Give me your last sword... 
Give me... 
Here is endless darkness 
Come here I want to embrace your robe 
Show me another holy imperial... 
To destroy again, To destroy forever 
Jabbar ! 
Let me to take your hands 
To fly on the endless gray skies 
Let me in the ravens mass 
Give me thy throne of doom 
Feel my body, Drink my blood 
Take my heart, Take my soul 
Merg my soul with your last angel 
Because I am the last, who serve you 
Teach me to drink her blood 
Let me to sacrifice for you 
Like Elizabeth Bathory 
Replace me with your sword 
I destroy forever, for you 
Because no one know my grave 
In the cemetery that you make... 
Do you remember that night ? 
The wind's whisper, in the the forest beyond 
Dancing of the shadows and happiness 
To make another cemetery 
And you tell it Jabbar... 
I serve you, forever... 
Trust me, trust yourself !!! 
I am Jabbar
