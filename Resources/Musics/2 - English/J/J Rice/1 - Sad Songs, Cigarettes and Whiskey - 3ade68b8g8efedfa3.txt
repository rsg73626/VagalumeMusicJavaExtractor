SAD SONGS, CIGARETTES AND WHISKEY

I’m a sucker for ones that make me cry,
And cut through me like a switchblade knife.
Bring up the pain from deep inside,
With a sound so good it hurts.

And I’m a sucker for a midnight drag,
A long slow dance of smokin ash.
I light em up and I breathe in fast,
And hope they calm my nerves.

And I hold onto that bottle of Jim Beam,
Like he’s my only friend.
But when he’s gone I think of her,
And I start all over again.

Some say be this way will kill me,
But she already has.
I’m just a ghost among the living,
No soul, just bones and flesh.
Yeah, she used to be my only love,
But now I have three:
Sad songs, cigarettes and whiskey.

I write em down on this old guitar,
As if a pen could mend my broken heart.
I let the minor chords find there mark,
Like a needle to the vein.
And I smoke em by myself these days,
They’re bad for your health everybody says.
But after watchin her walk away,
I don’t feel anything.

Some say be this way will kill me,
But she already has.
I’m just a ghost among the living,
No soul, just bones and flesh.
Yeah, she used to be my only love,
But now I have three:
Sad songs, cigarettes and whiskey.

And I hold onto that bottle of Jim Beam,
Like he’s my only friend.
But when hes gone I think of her,
And I start all over again .
Some say bein this way will kill me,
Son, leave it in the past.
It cant’ be too fulfilling,
Always starin at a half empty glass.

Some say bein this way will kill me,
But she already has.
I’m just a ghost among the living,
No soul, just bones and flesh.
Yeah, she used to be my only love,
But now I have three:
Sad songs, cigarettes and whiskey.

Well I’m a sucker for ones that make me cry.
