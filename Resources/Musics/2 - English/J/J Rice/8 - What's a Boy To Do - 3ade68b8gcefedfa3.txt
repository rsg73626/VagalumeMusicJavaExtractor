WHAT'S A BOY TO DO

The waves make sweet music when they melt across the shore
Just like my heart did when I met you years before
Your hair was gold as sunset sinkin down into the bay
And on summer nights like tonight I can't forget the taste

On a blanket under the park pier, you had my 'Stones t-shirt on
One moment you were here, the next you were gone

And I've spent twenty years tryin to find that magic again
I've had some I call lovers and others I've called friends
But not one time have I
Come close to me and you
What's a boy to do?

That palm tree where we carved our names still says that we're in love
But no amount of wishful thinkin's gonna make that true for us
And man oh man we burnt this town to the ground
But as for me those ashes, never really did die out

Cause I've spent twenty years tryin to find that magic again
I've had some I call lovers and others I've called friends
But not one time have I
Come close to me and you
What's a boy to do?

With a broken heart and a pocket full of postcard promises
That you made, then slipped away

And I've spent twenty years tryin to find that magic again
I've had some I call lovers and others I've called friends
But not one time have I
Come close to me and you
What's a boy to do?

Without a girl like you

Without you
