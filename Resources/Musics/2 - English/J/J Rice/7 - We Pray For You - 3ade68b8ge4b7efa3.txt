WE PRAY FOR YOU

If I could take
It away
The pain that you're feeling
The nightmare you're living...today
I wish that I
Could make a change
But I'm only one person
I'll take my share of the burden

I don't have much to give
But hopefully the world, will all join in
And say with me...

I pray for you
And if we stop for a moment
Imagine what we can
Do
I know together
We'll help you make it
Through
We'll help you make it through
We pray for you

While we are safely
Asleep
Mothers are searching
Lost and uncertain
In need

My heart won't let
Me believe
It's ok doing nothing
When others are suffering

Even if we don't have much to give
Hopefully the world, will all join in
And say with me...

Can't fix it all
Overnight
But we won't stop trying
Until everyone's hands
Unite

The future looks brighter
Now
You may be knocked down
But you'll be stronger somehow
