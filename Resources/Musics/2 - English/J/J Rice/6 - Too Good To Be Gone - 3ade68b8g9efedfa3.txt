TOO GOOD TO BE GONE

Never thought I’d find myself
In such a situation, like the day you left.
But the words you put to paper on the kitchen counter
Girl, they took my breath.
How can you say you never loved me?
And you say you never cared.
I don’t believe it for a moment,
Cuz I was right there.

When we drove around town with the windows down
Singin old love songs at the top of our lungs.
It was worth it then, girl remember when
We made love for the very first time,
And I wiped a tear from your pretty eyes.
More perfect than it’s ever been.
Yeah we had something strong,
Too good to be gone.

I’d do anything I could if you would
Just come to your senses and come back.
Oh, but something tells me there’ll be
Hell to pay before a day that you’ll do that.
If you’d just pick up the phone,
I know we could work it out.
And get back to makin memories
Like only we know how.

When we stayed up all night talking bout our lives
Shared our dreams on that old porch swing
It was worth it then, girl remember when.
We rode on out to the county line,
And we slow danced to the soft moon light
More perfect than, It’s ever been.
Yeah we had somethin strong.
Too good to be gone.

I’d give everything to do the things
We’ve done a thousand times
And I’m wonderin if what we did
Ever crosses your mind

Like when we drove around town
Singin old love songs at the top of our lungs.
It was worth it then, girl remember when
We made love for the very first time
And I wiped a tear from your pretty eyes.
More perfect than it’s ever been.
Yeah we had something strong,
Too good to be gone.
