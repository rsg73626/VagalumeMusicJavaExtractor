THAT'S WHAT'S UP DOWN SOUTH

Old folks, on the porch, tellin' everything they know
Eatin' at the cafe, 50 years ain't missed a day
Six gears, John Deere's, man it's been a good year
Got the rain, crops came, it was a blessing
Main Street, dang the heat, Lord it must be 93

Six pack, iced down, we're all headin' outta town
Swimmin' hole, nice and cold, swingin' in on the rope,
Double-dawg dare ya bo, hey now here we go

Thats what's up down South
Simple livin' that's we're all about
Call your neighbors, we help each other out
Thats what's up down South

Kids sneaking out, momma's house, clutch out, quiet now
Wal-Mart parking lot, cruisin' back and forth a lot
Big trucks, getting buck, turnin' Lynard Skynard up
Holler at the young-uns, tryin' hard to get you some
Midnight, moonlight, baby let's take a ride
Roll down the windows, slid over to the middle
Full tank, riverbank, girl what's your last name

Don't I know your cousin? Can I get a little lovin'?

Thats what's up down South
Simple livin' that's we're all about
Call your neighbors, we help each other out
Thats what's up down South

We like sweet tea, blue jeans, boots and caps
Johnny Cash and the American flag

Friday night bright lights, touchdown, halftime
High school football, ain't nothin' like it ya'll
Go to church on Sunday mornin', listen to the preacher's sermon
Tailgate, watch the race, Dale's runnin' good today!

Thats what's up down South
Simple livin' that's we're all about
Call your neighbors, we help each other out
Thats what's up down South
