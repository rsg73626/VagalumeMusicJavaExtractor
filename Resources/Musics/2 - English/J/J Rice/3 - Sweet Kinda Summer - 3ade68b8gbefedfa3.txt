SWEET KINDA SUMMER

Flight 5094 can't get here fast enough
Lord, and leave this winter behind
I've got my shades on waitin in the concourse
And I'm ready to fly
To....

A sweet kind of summer standin' knee deep in the water
Drinkin' straight tequila and lime
Got my arm around a lady, and a red cup in a koozie
Cruisin' on Key West time
Sweet kind of summer

I told the cabbie man, take me to the sand
In this place called paradise
I've got a line that needs baitin' and a senorita waitin'
When the full moon fills up the sky

Sweet kind of summer standin' knee deep in the water
Drinkin' straight tequila and lime
Got my arm around a lady, and a red cup in a koozie

Cruisin' on Key West time
Sweet kind of summer

Left my phone on the mainland, don't wanna be found
I just wanna get down in a pirate town

In a sweet kind of summer standing knee deep in the water
Sippin coconut rum on ice
Got another drink waitin'
And the radio station's playin'
"No Woman, No Cry"

Sweet kind of summer standin' knee deep in the water
Drinkin' straight tequila and lime

Got my arm around my baby, and a red cup in a koozie
Cruisin' on Key West time
Sweet kind of summer
