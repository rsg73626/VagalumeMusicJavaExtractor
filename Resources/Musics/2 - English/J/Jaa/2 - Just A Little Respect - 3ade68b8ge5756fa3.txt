JUST A LITTLE RESPECT

When I trust in you, I'm crazy
You don't earn my confidence
When I believe in you, I'm crazy
You are not who I think you are

I hate you! For wait on high school
I hate you! For be patient when I can't
I hate you! For hide who you are
I hate you! For the miss of...

R-E-S-P-E-C-T
That it don't means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care, we are here

Yeah, a little respect
Yeah-yeah-yeah, a little respect
Respect!
