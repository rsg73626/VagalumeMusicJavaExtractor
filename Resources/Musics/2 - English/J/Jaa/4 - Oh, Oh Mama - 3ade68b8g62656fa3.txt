OH, OH MAMA

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep (yessa)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yessa)
All the touches, all the kisses, all the hughes
Makes me feel like I'm the one. Oh, oh mama.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ladies, u lookin' good)
When I think in your touches, I trip from Peru to Cebu (uh, uh)
Jodpur to Ho Chi Min, yeah
I need some affection, mama. Oh, oh mama.

Take my cars, take my keys, take all you want
But you won't take my soul (take my soul!)
Oh, oh mama. I'm more than what you think

And all the touches, all the kisses, all the hughes.
Makes me feel like I'm the one.
