SECRET FROM ME

Under my skin is a place of God
Under my skin is a secret you know
Under my soul is a body with plans

Uh-uh
I got a secret that I did
Uh-uh
Something is coming over
Uh-uh
I like you and you love me

But nobody knows what I feel inside
Cause you just see from your side
I'm under your skin

Uh-uh
I got a secret that I did
Uh-uh
Something is coming over
Uh-uh
I like you and you love me

Changing the style, J
Hey, J-double A!
We can't control this people crazy
From the ugly cities with pretty ladies
J-double A is amazing
Come on baby, Hey!

We just sipping camomile for...
Stop!

Uh-uh
I got a secret that I did
Uh-uh
Something is coming over
Uh-uh
I like you and you love me

Uh-uh
I got a secret that I did
Uh-uh
Something is coming over
Uh-uh
I like you and you love me
