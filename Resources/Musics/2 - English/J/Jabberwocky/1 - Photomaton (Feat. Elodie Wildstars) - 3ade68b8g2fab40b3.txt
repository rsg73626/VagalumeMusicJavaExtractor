PHOTOMATON (FEAT. ELODIE WILDSTARS)

I let you miles away, can't feel your breath in my hairs
It seems to be years
and I'm alone and fake, and I'm alone and fake
If this world is too small to be two
a world without sense if I'm without you
It's always the wrong way
there's no return to life so you get your car and drive
Look at the game of your life, you never took all the dice
After all, curtains fall, there's no return to life
so get the car and die

Waiting for hope babe, there's no more light in my sky
See the pills in my hand, I'm running through your lies
You've got nothing to say, 'til I'm crossing the line
But you can't kill my name, demon's coming tonight (x2)

[Verse 2: Elodie Wildstars]
The dolls inside me cave in, blood and tears on my skin
My wounds bring up my fear
but I like this last, this last grip
I just wanna rid me of my pain
this happy violence is beating in my veins
It's always the wrong way
there's no return to life, I'm in the car and drive

[Chorus]
Waiting for hope babe, there's no more light in my sky
See the pills in my hand, I'm running through your lies
You've got nothing to say, 'til I'm crossing the line
But you can't kill my name, demon's coming tonight (x2)
