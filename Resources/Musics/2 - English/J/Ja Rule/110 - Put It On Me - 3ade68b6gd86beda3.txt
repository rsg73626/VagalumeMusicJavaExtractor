PUT IT ON ME

[Intro {Lil' Mo}]
Where would I be without you, baby
so if you need me, if you want me, to put in on you
because I love ya don't ya forget it
whenever you need me, if ya want me, to put it on you
C'Mon

{Ja Rule}
What would I be without my baby
That thought alone might break me
And I don't want to go crazy
Cause every thug needs a lady...

Girl It feels like you and I been born in together
inseperable, We chose pain over pleasure
and for that you'll forever be a - part of me
mind body and soul ain't no I in WE baby
When you cry who wipes your tears
when you scared who's tellin you
there's nothing to fear
girl I'll always be there
when you need a shoulder to lean on
never hesitate, know who you can call on,
your soul mate, and vice-versa
that's why I be the first to
see Jacob and frost your wrist up,
now you owe me
I know you tired being lonely
so baby girl put it on me...

Chorus
[Ja Rule (Lil' Mo)]

What would I be without you (what would I be without you)
I only think about you (what ur sayin is true)
I know you tired being lonely (i need someone to hold me)
so babygirl put it on me (i will, i will, i will) (2x)

And I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me baby
and the house on the hill when you dropped like 80
on a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
and ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
and what would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
when this cold world had a girl caught in the storm
and I accept who your with when your caught in the wrong
and respect when you flip cause our love is strong
and when you hit the block I watch for 10-fo'
and when my pops asleep you snuck in the back door
baby bo'  we've been down since junior high
so when life gets as hot as July
it's the world against you and I
we ballin' tied together and never
heart from the heart knew
that it would last forever
when you told me
you would never leave me lonely
so baby boy put it on me....

Chorus

Since we met its been you and I
a tear for a tear baby
eye for an eye
and you that my heart gon' cry
if you leave me lonely
cause you not just my love, you my homey
who gonna console me, my love
I'm out of control hold me, my love cause I'm yours
and I don't wanna do nothing to hurt my baby girl
if this was our world
it'd be all yours baby
The thought alone might break me
and i dont wanna go crazy
cuz every thug needs a lady (baby)

I'm feelin you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
wash away all the tears
there be no more cryin (no more cryin)
and you complete me
and I would die if you ain't with me
so baby girl put it on me

Chorus (4x)
