verse 1 
what has this world come to 
when a nigga like me could be perceived the american dream 
life aint always what it seems my younguns 
please believe strugglin always provokes the hustlin 
to that we accustomed 
you get acquainted with everybody throughout the hood 
still don't trust 'em 
trust is a serious thing 
most niggas don't trust nobody they aint know since sixteen 
does that mean the devil is in us of course 
who you think is holdin us up to fall short 
touch but don't taste taste but don't swallow 
and these are the rules that we 'posed to follow 
people pray for eternity never see tomorrow 
they just wishin the lord would take 'em away from the horror that 
I'm currently bringin y'all motherfuckers gonna hafta 
murder me swingin bud I won't die 

verse 2 
hear what I'm sayin y'all niggas better start sayin prayers 
cuz a nigga wit no cares is finally here 
say what I want when I want fuck police 
cuz my gangsta niggas know we own the streets 
with the wind beneath my wings ground under my feet 
I'm the black rose nigga that grew from concrete 
it's the rule get it right or get it real hot 
a whole lotta shots sent flying through your block gunshot 
the one I need and oh before I leave 
does anybody else feel they don't wanna breathe 
been menacing this society since conceived 
and nigga you know cold hearts don't bleed 
still they pray for eternity never seein tomorrow 
they just wishin the lord would take 'em away from the horror that 
I'm currently bringin y'all motherfuckers gonna hafta
