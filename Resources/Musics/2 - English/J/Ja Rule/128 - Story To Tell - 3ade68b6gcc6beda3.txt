Yo, the Swatch bred Thoroughbred, 
shockingly took two to the head Knowledge me God, 
the shit I’m bout to holler is hard 
From start, this little nigga had a hell of a heart 
His pops, bangin that shit in his arms, broken 
A young mind distorted emotions, is there an upside? 
His brother got murdered up 
North by milletas Ma-ma, battlin, cancer, of the colon 
At the tender age of thirteen, watchin his world close in 
Blood damn near frozen, from a heart so cold 
It ain’t pumpin out the love no mo’, and I feel that 
Where’s God when you really need it, where the love at? 
That’s why a lot of niggaz got more faith in they gat 
Freeze that like a photo, take it with you and know 
This lil’ nigga bout to kill all comers for cash flow 
His role model, the heat, cause it runs streets 
His motto: ‘Nobody eats but me!’ 
Finally this young thug turned pro 
Used to show love now he nuttin but hatred and foes 
Five-double-oh’s, hoes so deep 
He the type of nigga that got it and break down a key 
Remember me? J to the A R-U-L-E baby 
Smell beef, it continue to uhh, give em hell 
Fill they bodies with shells and leave niggaz with a story to tell, 
uh-huh

Listen I got a story to tell 
On the streets we got guns and drugs for sale 
Cause you hoes know the game that we play is real 
Keep your mind on the money and your weapons concealed 
Listen up I got a story to tell I’m prayin to God, 
know I’m goin to hell If its out of my hands, 
I’ll let time prevail, huh 
Listen up I got a story to tell 
Listen up I got a story to tell 
Yeah, uhh, yeah Let me holla at y’all

Son in B’More, we scored more, than ever before 
Copped the two door, six-double-oh off a roll 
Show no love for loss since big eight be that lucky number, 
we slammed eight of those in Kentucky 
Kept the currency comin, mo’, diamonds 
New clothes L.A. hoes that’ll ride us pronto 
Once you, lived in luxury, you can’t leave it 
Find yourself, turnin broke bitches into demons 
Can you believe this? In Cleveland we cuttin these niggaz 
Creepin Tie em on every block, til we shut down shop 
So keep your glock cocked, one in the head 
Push the five series drop just in case we gotta spit and spread 
The alibi be simply, 
we was in the Carribean with two of our women 
friends sippin Remi and Henny 
From there we’ll flow, to the Florida 
Keys and blow trees Fuck a couple of hoes and spend some cheese 
That’s how a boy’s life is supposed to be 
Make our way to N.O. cause we 
Bout It Bout It Then down to D.C. where they, 
cock it pop it Listen up life is nuttin 
but the hot shit from here to Wisconsin 
Y’all niggaz can get it constant 
It ain’t hard that’s like pushin dope in the 5th Ward 
And just to get to God, 
I’ll go through hell and leave the world, 
a story to tell, heh

Listen I got a story to tell
