FOOLISH

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you treat me so bad
You says you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had
And though my heart is eatin' for you
I can't stop cryin'
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way
And still I stay

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you wanna do me wrong
See, when I'm home, I'm all alone
And you are always gone
Boy, you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you can bring me to so many tears
After all these years

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Oh, I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad, what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
So all of my ladies
Feel me, come on sing with me

See when I get the strength to leave you
Always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cuz I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You could learn appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change, never gonna change
Never gonna change

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window 
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
