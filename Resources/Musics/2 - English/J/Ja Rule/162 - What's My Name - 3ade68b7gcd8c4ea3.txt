WHAT'S MY NAME

[18 second intro about the Bible] 

[Ja Rule] 
Yeah, yeah (woo!) woo (we here, geah) 
C'mon (we ain't goin nowhere, c'mon) 
Remix, c'mon 
(now, this is Jimmy Cliff Notes) 
(I'ma run through the roster man) 
Let 'em know (on Murder INC) 
Uhh (startin with Ashanti - owwwwwtch!) 

[Chorus: Ashanti] + (Ja) 
J-A-R (yeah) U-L-E (what, let 'em know) 
(Who else you thought it would beeeee) 
(All my bitches with me say) 
J-A-R, U-L-E (what's my name, nigga?) 
(Who'da thought this wouldn't, beeeee) 
(Everybody with me say) 

[Ja Rule] 
Holla!! I'm back 
Anyone with good sense bet on that 
Cause I ain't never went nowhere, I still got business here 
All my bitches get your hands in the air 
Now BACK THAT ASS, UP ON ME - now let's roll 
Go, goin, gone, sold 
What's cooler than bein cool? (ICE COLD) Y'all know 
that I do this for all my niggaz and my bitches 
And it's murder 'til day that I die, can't spit it no more 
All my niggaz that tusslin, get yours 
All my bitches that's makin money, get yours 
The world ain't only mine, it's yours 
And I'm sure 
That, there's no love if you don't go through pain 
And I'm the nigga that done changed the game 
What's my name? 

[Chorus] w/ minor changes to Ja ad libs 

[Ja Rule] 
Who's that nigga? 
If you feelin yourself youse that nigga, tryin to get hit up 
Buried in cat litter cause that's how INC get up 
Makin sure they don't get up, it's murder 
Who's that bitch? 
If you feelin yourself youse that bitch, tryin to get rich 
Dyin to get hitched to a nigga that's caked up 
Willin to spend time and even more at Jacob 
But you assume position, face down, ass up 
And I think I got you in that same pose pinned up 
In a picture painted frame been hangin love 
Ass naked, lookin like you're high on drugs 
And that's whassup, what, all bitch niggaz is gettin touched 
And no bad bitches is gettin fucked 
Cause you know who, did you know what, if you know what's 
Then you know it's not a game, what's my name? 

[Chorus] w/ minor changes to Ja ad libs 

[Ja Rule] + (Ashanti) 
Ba-by girl, is you with me? Shit (yes sir!) 
Sayin all of that without speakin a word 
(I like) to do this that and a third 
(And I love) the way you put in reverse 
And now clap for me mami, clap back, keep it swervin 
Wide body had to be built by suburban 
Niggaz around lookin like they nervous, I see 'em 
Niggaz around me wanna rob him and leave him 
But I'm partyin tonight for one reason 
Niggaz know that the bullshit was dead on the streets 
Niggaz I'm gettin high, gettin head as we speak 
Long live the great ones, B.I.G, P.A.C. 
I'm "Ready to Die," "All Eyez on Me" 
And niggaz know they can do it the same 
But still they try to diss, that's part of the game 
What's my name? 

[Chorus] w/ same as before 

[Ja Rule] 
Yeah, yeah 
Murder INC, all my family we here 
Big shout to all my niggaz 
All my crud niggaz, all my street niggaz, all my grime niggaz 
All my industry niggaz, all my corporate niggaz 
It's love, it's pain, and we together mayn 
Holla back at me, uhh
