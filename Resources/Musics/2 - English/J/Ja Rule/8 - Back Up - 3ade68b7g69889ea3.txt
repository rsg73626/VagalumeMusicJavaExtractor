BACK UP

[Da Brat] (JD) 
This a test 
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh 
This ain't no test 
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh 
It's the real shit 
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh 
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh 
Yeah 
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh 
(Bounce) uh-oh (bounce) 

[Da Brat] (JD) 
If you can feel it in your back (Baby) 
It's the sounds of the motherfuckin' Brat (Baby) 
In the corner passing blunts, sippin' Yack (Baby) 
And if you must play the game 
Then gamble the stake's raised 
Take baby to Vegas I need the paper 
My flesh burnin' 
Niggas got me under surveillance their necks turnin' 
I'm an international playa, close observation 
The best policy is to stay in y'all faces 
The bad seed, I get niggas like I breath it's easy 
Been through niggas lyin' and cheatin' with bitches that's sleazy 
None of it's worth repeatin' 
If you flash money, spend that money or you can beat it 
I'mma star now, so it wasn't really shit for me to get shot down 
Spit illicit, unrestricted game, I'm independent 
Open the door to the bank but g's spent this 

1 - If you out here doing things 
You're a honey getting money 
Playin' all of these fellas like dummies 
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game 
(Tell them they better back up) 
(Playa, playa back up) 
If you out here doing things 
(Doin' doin' thangs) 
You're a playa getting money 
Spending none on none of these hoes 
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game 
(Tell 'em they better back up) 
(Shorty, shorty back up) 

[Ja Rule] 
For the first time I can see my lifeline 
And you're ahead of me 
Thank God hard to imagine me 
But Lord why me?
