BLACK VODKA

Black vodka
Body still proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka
Body still proper
I love the way she is on top of me

I .. on a weekend
But this was the day after Wednesday
..
Just for twos ugly like a hangover
How the fuck .. should have remained sober
.. turn the lights off .. just like when the shows is over
Too much of patrol might kill you .. mind blow
Fill me more important if you feel her
.. have not enough â€¦

Black vodka
Body still proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka
Body still proper
I love the way she is on top of me
