J-LO DA HOE

I smell a hoe
Itâ€™s J-LO
I smell a hoe
It must be J-LO the fuckin hoe

Baby donâ€™t go
Baby donâ€™t go

Please go J-LO
Please go you fuckin hoe

(Chorus)

Donâ€™t be fooled by the rocks that J-LOâ€™s got
She still Jenny from the block
Use to have a little pussy now she has a lot
No matter where she goes she noâ€™s where she comes from
(The whore house in Bronx)

Picture the scenery 
Bitches like J-LO putting music in our society 
Which sounds like fuckin misry

Hoeâ€™s like J-LO sucks dick to get rich 
& this is the game she plays just to get fame 
which is quite lame 

J-LO is just a fuckin hoe
She even fucks doe, so?

Always saying sheâ€™s from the block 
Bitch always fucks every hour of the clock
I guess she needs a pussy lock 

Cause your from the block J-Lo, you think youâ€™re a big hommy
Bitch your just a fuckin phony

(Chorus)

How many times have you been a bride?
Thatâ€™s right bitch where is your fuckin pride?

Yes we no you are rich
But your still a bitch 

People say youâ€™ve got a good body 
But deep inside you J-LO your nobody

You say you are cool
Bitch your just a fool

(Chorus)

How may maids do you have?
Thatâ€™s right bitch you must have aids
Is that why you need so many maids
Are you counting your dayz
Cause trust me bitch your gonna go through a bad phaze
Bitch you say you hold your spot
What spot is that your G spot
You think your hot 
Yeah your so hot/ NOT!

(Chorus)

Bitch how can you claim your independent 
Bitch your dependant on your pussy
Is that why you try to act like a missy, bitch your just a hussy 

I hear your easy 
Yeah you no to fuck 
Your just a fuckin slut

(Chorus)

You think youâ€™re a good looker
