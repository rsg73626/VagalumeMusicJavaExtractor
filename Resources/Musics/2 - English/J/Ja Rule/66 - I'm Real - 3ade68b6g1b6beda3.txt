I'M REAL

[Jennifer Lopez] (Ja Rule)
What's My Name
R-U-L-E
(Blowin back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin the game)
And the game done chose me
(To bring pain to the jerky guys and jerky ladies, it's one in the same)
Ever since you told me
(There's only room for two, I've been makin less room for you)
Now only God can hold me
(Hug me, love me, judge me, the only Man that hovers above me, holla)

I met so many men and
It's like their all the same
My appetite for lovin
Is now my hunger pain

And when I'm feelin sexy
Who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is
Their insecurity

1 - [Jennifer Lopez] (Ja Rule)
(Tired of bein alone) Yeah, yeah
(Sick of arguin on the phone) Yeah, yeah
(And you're tellin all your friends) Yeah, yeah
(That your man don't understand) My love

2 - [Jennifer Lopez] (Ja Rule)
Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Ja Rule]
Girl, I've been thinkin bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets
Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin at me, smilin at me, laughin like we wasn't happy
But not knowin that we're growin and we're gettin married
Hard lovin and straight thuggin
baby, I ain't doin this here for nuttin
I'm here to get it poppin, hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin in the wind, sun glistenin off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But feel me, feel me baby

Repeat 2

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin me and hatin me, treatin me ungratefully
But not knowin that they ain't makin or breakin me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

Now people screamin what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them to mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 till end
