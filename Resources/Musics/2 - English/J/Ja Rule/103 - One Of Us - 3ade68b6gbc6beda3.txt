ONE OF US

Well when I die, pacify, crucify me, 
I rock the double cross, 
ones for the soul and one for the body 
if I’m built in God’s eyes, I wanna see God cry 
real tears from a burnt out life for 10 years 
I swear I got the devil in me with no fear 
if I hear I can’t see, if I see I can’t hear, 
it’s an eerie little thing between deafness and blindness 
weakness and kindness rejects and promise 
my mind when I’m hollering dear Lord take me 
cause I ain’t really happy here can you blame me 
this game done changed me made me an animal 
I can’t even laugh no more my kids smile for me now 
I’m the first and only my mammas only child 
Lord save me before I go crazy 
cause if you live through the strain just to die from the pain 
tell me would you believe that you can breathe again

If God was one of us 
would he sin and love to lie 
I wanna 
know if God was one of us 
would he frak and live his life 
I wanna know 
if God was on of us 
would he use his name in vein 
I need to know 
if God was one of us 
would he believe that could breathe again

Now lets look at things through a right hand 
what if you was that man would you run with him gun with him 
would you undertsand the hustle and the strugglin 
live amoungst dope heads raising your kids and running from the feds 
we bound to bump heads 
cause you living my life 
all righteous and you said living righteous was right
but there’s two sides of life 
one dark one light if lighten up forever you could dim to the night 
grab them guns over there and bring them on over here 
cause my God’s bigger than your god down here 
now we ride jets leir baby, bubble in Belaire 
cause Rule and the Lord got it going on 
been known to do bad shit I’m so heavenly but so devilish 
shit if you live through the strain just to die from the pain 
tell me would you believe that you can breathe again

If God was one of us 
would he sin and love to lie 
I wanna 
know if God was one of us 
would he frak and live his life 
I wanna know 
if God was on of us 
would he use his name in vein 
I need to know 
if God was one of us 
would he believe that could breathe again

Now trade places Rule be spirit God be flesh 
and lets see just how weak the flesh gets 
now you call on me every night bended knee 
until you start to realize I ain’t answering 
now you hang up the phone Lord 
pick up the chrome Lord 
can I blame you Lord needing to feed what’s yours 
got a wife that you love but you still lust whores 
and I’m supposed to judge you on earth where its earthly 
you might as well aim at the sky, slug me 
cause I ain’t being a fair god, when life is so hard 
I know every crime committed every little mistake 
and still got love for you fair is fair 
as long as you repent you’ll be good up here 
cause if you live through the strain just to die from the pain 
tell me would you believe that you could breathe again

If God was one of us 
would he sin and love to lie 
I wanna 
know if God was one of us 
would he frak and live his life 
I wanna know 
if God was on of us 
would he use his name in vein 
I need to know 
if God was one of us 
would he believe that could breathe again

If God was one of us 
would he sin and love to lie 
I wanna 
know if God was one of us 
would he frak and live his life 
I wanna know 
if God was on of us 
would he use his name in vein 
I need to know 
if God was one of us 
would he believe that could breathe again
