REAL LIFE FANTASY

I'm a rockstar rick james mick jagger
Bright light big stages bad habbits
Get high got to prison and invade taxes
This is not what I invison
When I started rapping.
Fuck the mansions, the pantoms, the sweets, the cabanas
Beacuse none of that matters when the mirror shatters
All I see is pieces of me scattered
Is it a miracle or is it madness?
Because when I puts it all together it freflexs this,
And this is me
About as you gonna get to insanity or genius
My real life fantasy

Is this my life or am I dreaming
I can't lie I don't believe it
Iiiii... I don't believe it
Iiiii... is this my life

Talking fantasies, they're more twistes then memories
I never thought gotti would leave the game like d r e
Never thought shanti would ever stop reppin the team,
And the fuck is lloyd hooking up with the enemies
If this was 03 I would have told you,
You was crazy if you told me this is what it would be
I miss vita caddy black child charlie,
I thought we were tighter then the marleys... family
But I guess you can't be, in an industry there's nothing but envy,
Jealousy... please nobody be friend me!
Nah, my real life fantasy

Is this my life or am I dreaming
I can't lie I don't believe it
Iiiii... I don't believe it
Iiiii... is this my life
