I CRY

When I cry, you cry, we cry together (4x)

I love my life, I love my wife
When bad times prevail and overwhelm me
I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy
I know these hoes love me because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Just gimme some bottles of that Remy Martin
Let's get the party crackin right here, fuck Vip
Knowin my baby loves me, home wit tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she's just surprised that we
Been together for this long, and I could be
The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever
Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together

(Chorus)
When I cry, you cry, we cry together (4x)

From what I recall, we was lil niggas
Cuttin school, gettin high with the hottest bitches
Livin life so free that we ain't fearin
The ills of the world or the heat of drug dealin
You and I done made a killin and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasures
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close, not the love between us
But your love for the dough
You went O-T, started makin M-O-N-E-Y
Why All my good niggas gotta die
Wish it could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

(Repeat Chorus)

Wash away your tears, my love
You ain't got to cry no more, my love
I put it on everything that I love
That my pain is my love, and I want
This world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a mothafucka
But I ignored the warnin and kept on hustlin
And every night she'd just look at me with tears in her eyes
And then be sayin shit like I don't want my baby to die
For so much pain to her life, I gotta make it better
Cause when Ma cried, I cried, we cried together

(Repeat Chorus)
