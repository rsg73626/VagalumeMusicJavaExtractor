And God only looks after, children and
fools and you neither, so who gon'

True baby, it's only for you baby
Vita's thighs only divide, if you

Nobody can get it
And if it's comin'OR gunnin'
Just consider it spited
So when you gone for a minute
I just fantasize, Like if it's

Then I'm satisfied
Til' you come back to me 
Holdin' stacks and jewls
V-I-T-A and my nigga J-A

Shed tears for ya, cuz boy ya got to me
There'll never be another for me (for me)
You'll always be my one and only (only)

[Charli "Chuck" Babltimore] (Ja Rule)

Now baby I told you
I can show you better than I could
tell you
Blow trial to bring comissary and mail
Those sweet words and nacked fACE
I'm still that pretty down down ass
Two cars behind ya six
And I diss any clown
GLOCKIN my ROUND ass
Only a down ass and it's all for you
I've GROWN a tad bit
Since we've been at it like rabbits
The booty little plumper and it's
(All for the RULE)
Who's gonna love ya like that?
Thug wit you with a stack to the ceiling
Splitting A DUB  with you
Cuz I play my position
Cold D's O.G's
Until that blood shed blood red
And we O.D.ed
Remember every word that you told me
(Show me, Hold me)
All you need in your life is Chuck, 
Drugs, and dubs or twenty twos
Now tell me who da hunny for you, 
CHUCK
