THE CROWN

Sizzla
They can't keep a good man down (yeah)
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and i stood my ground
They will never ever take my crown (let's get to the song)

Who Jah Bless i say no man curse
Things getting better when they thought it would get worse
Here comes the officers asking for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw first.

Ja Rule
I know y'all niggaz is second guessin' the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin' hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your car, turn off your lights
And "50" you have it, cause when Rule' spit to the masses
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass

Talking And Shot's Fired

Ja Rule
I know y'all niggaz is second guessin' the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin' hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your car, turn off your lights
And "50" you have it, cause when Rule' spit to the massed
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass
And if it's pussy we talkin' I calmally smash em'
Personal foul like cole, when I sexual harass em'
Cause bitches want you beat it with passion
Niggaz want to you to clip up and clap em'
And hide the body like nuthin' happened
Niggaz need to get they money and stick to rappin'
Or end up like one of the Jackson's beware of your actions
Cause you don't wanna meet that desert e'
With that hair pin trigger so easy to squeeze
And no matter how you cut me I'm always cheese
Like "Black" said, It's a hundred and eighty, seven degrees muthafucka'

Chorus
They can't keep a good man down (yeah)
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and i stood my ground
They will never ever take my crown (let's get to the song)

Who Jah Bless i say no man curse
Things getting better when they thought it would get worse
Here comes the officers asking for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw first.

Ja Rule
You know they can't keep a real nigga down (no)
Not what they niggaz can even wash up it's federal
Comin and puttin snicthes on a pedestal, glorify
Had to put niggaz in jail fo' life, ain't no blood in they eye
But who, Ja' bless 'em with tha sizzla touch
Thing's gettin better when they thought it would get worse
I bomb first, and breath in the heat, knowin to hell I send em'
And I ain't talkin' devils or demons, just be happy ya breathin
And cowards get to hiccupin' and sneezin'
leavin every soul cold, and bodies more than a day old
Drving down on a yayo and dump it, like fuck it
Niggaz addict to hutslin, no one can ever be trusted
who told the feds' to rush ya
Why you fishin' in darken looking for sharks in the ocean to rise 
Coast to coast man
Just look around Rule' will never back down
And y'all can never ever take my crown (niggaz)

Chorus w/ Ja Talkin
Yeah, Yeah, That's what the fuck I'm sayin..
Talk to 'em baby
Tell theses niggaz, what these niggaz know?
You know niggaz, no man touch this muthfucka right here
(Ya hear me?)
Niggaz going in they dreams to fuck with me, b
Murder inc (shit) Holla
Murder inc... yeah murder inc..
It's murder inc... we do this shit, we do this thang'
This thang called... this thang we call drugs nigga
in the booth... lyrically
I get's the job done you know me baby
Holla back, Rule
