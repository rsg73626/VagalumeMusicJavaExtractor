NEVER THOUGHT

[Chorus] 
(I never thought) 
That you would fall in love with this side of me first 
(That I'd be) 
Intrigued with the thought of the gift and the curse 
(Without ya) 
And now your heart broke and it's making it worse 
(Why Me, Why Me) 
WHY ME 
(I never thought) 
That you would be involved with a nigga like I 
(That I'd be) 
Scared to look passion right in it's eyes 
(Without ya) 
And when you found love it was nothing but lies 
(Why Me, Why Me) 
Why, who would've thought 

[Verse] 
What the fuck is ya hobby mami highway robbery 
cuz u got enough jewelry on ya body to buy a Farari 
i'm like Ruben i'm sorry but I dont studder 
matter fact call me Frank Love cuz i'd love to fuck ya 
she said slow baby dont rush 
I promise if u be patient i'll let u tear it up 
and nigga sho nuff 
we decided to keep in touch with each other u feel me 
I didnt know we'd be touching ?? 
i'm surious, and i'm so sincure 
my object is to stay in the clear 
cuz we find fuck and flee these broads round here 
I done made so many women shed so many tears 
sittin home all alone getting drunk off of shots of bathome 
decided to call let her feelings be known 
in a slurred tone, she said I always get what I want 
and what I want is u, but I dont get it cuz... 

[Chorus] 

Girl our, situation is getting a little out of my hands 
u calling me constant telling bitches that i'm ya man 
I thought we was just friends conversating 
gettin to know one another on a friendly basis 
lets face it we from two different worlds that dont collide 
but when they do the crash is more like a biz-omb 
your favorite seasons bigati and mines is summer 
u use credit I rubber band wrap my hundreds 
what we got in common is minimal right next to nothin 
and I think that's whats subliminally keepin u comin 
back to the one u been fuckin but never thought you'd be fuckin 
how often do u think about the awkwardness of it 
I know u love it to say the least 
and I aint just sayin that contrary to some beliefs opposites attract 
and my track record is something to be expected 
money cash hoes u know how it goes 

[Chorus] 

Who would have thought that something so simple would turn out to be detriminal 
now i'm feeling like i'm caught in the middle 
of this love triangle between she me and reality 
reality is tellin us that we could never be 
cuz I come from the streets and u come from a rich family 
but I dont think that your family would understand me 
it's the little things u overlook when you're around me 
drugs guns bitches and needless to say 
you're a pimp in your own way 
baby you're makin it hard for me to look in your eyes and tell u to move on 
i'm gone (i'm gone) 
but then i'm back again 
money and good pussy's a fatal attraction for men 
she hits me every night quarter past ten 
and with every call her voice got a little more intense 
now we involved and it really dont make no sense 
so be careful what u ask for u just might get it biaaaatch! 

[Chorus]
