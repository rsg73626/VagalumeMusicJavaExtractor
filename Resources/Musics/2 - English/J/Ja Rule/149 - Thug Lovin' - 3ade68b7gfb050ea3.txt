THUG LOVIN'

It's on and poppin' baby! The Last Temptation! He's Back! Y'all know who
I'm talking bout! 

Chorus:Bobby Brown
And I know you're gettin bored
Dealin with him,
I know you miss my lovin, my thuggin
Thug Lovin'

Verse 1:Ja Rule
I know you're livin your life, faithfully
Safe from me, away from me, but you miss being next to me
Don't you-don't let our love haunt you
Lust for what you want and go for your guns
And back out on anyone tries to interfere or intervene
With me peelin your wide body outta them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, seats on lean, shoes 19
Comin through in that Bentley thang
The top of the town, the keys to the city
You and I make headlines like Lo, and Diddy
Bob and Whitney
I'm here cuz the Lord sent me, pound push like a fugilist 
But I'm real devilish and freak that bad bitches, shit
But you-a different story and I know your
gettin bored and
And he ain't gettin you horny no more, is he?
When it's all said and done, it's me
Lovin, thuggin and I know you're

[Chorus 2x]

Sweet thang livin' it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how you deal with it
On your weekly visits, use a code name
To protect the innocent
Maybe I'm too generous
Generally believin that all women want me
They don't wanna get even
But who do you believe in?
Is it money or God?
Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred
Cuz I love it when you pop your body-body
Move your body-body
Drink up all the Bacardi
And roll up alongside me
I love too see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is that you need my heat
Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Lovin', thuggin' and I know you...

[Chorus 2x]

Baby, here I'm holdin' your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
Cause you been gettin' at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays
Cause I been in a rage lately
Hopin' God'll forgive me for all the sin and all the woman
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginnin'
I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built
like me!! 
The black sheep of my family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love lookin' somethin' like soft porn
Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him??
But the brightest of your days just goin' look dim
Cause you fuckin' with a loser, baby, you can't win
When it's said and done you're gonna need me
Lovin', thuggin' and I know you....

[Chorus 2x]

Yeah, yeah, I.G, Ja Rule
B. Brown Murder Inc.
Def Jam, Sony
This is what we buildin' here
Murder Inc.
Ha-ha-ha
Bobby Brown
Murder
Ha-ha
It's that real

Bring it back my, niggaz
B. Brown, ha-ha

And I know you're gettin' bored
