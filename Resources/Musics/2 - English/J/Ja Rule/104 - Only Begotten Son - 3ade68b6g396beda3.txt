ONLY BEGOTTEN SON

He who believes in Ja Shall not be condemned
But he that believeth not Is condemned already
Only because He has not believed In the man
And the only begotten son
My Lord

Chorus (2X): For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I wont cry
Cause I live to die
Wit my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

Yeah, Why would you leave somethin you love here to die
In the cold And it grows
Like a concrete rose
Beautiful ain't I
Till I withered and died
On the same streets you left me
And, screamin Lord let me in
I don’t know where to begin
Since I lost yo love
But then again your love
Was strictly for the drugs
I don’t know whether to hug
Or to fill you with slugs
Fuckin them hoes Instead of claiming whats rightfully yours
Holdin my heart from all the pain you caused
With no direction you left your first born lost
Give or take a few
Cause my hate for you
Grew, over the years Through blood, sweat and tears
I wanted to be just like you
My father figure now I want to fight you
You bitch nigga You left me alone
And parts of me never out grown
The fact that left home
When moms was so strong
Don’t let them get you fed
This world is yours she said
Now nothin that stoppin me but two to the head
In life theres more to come
When its all said and done
You lost one love
Your only begotten son

Chorus (2X)

But what a nigga live for
And damn ready to die young
I’m the shadow behind the gun
Look st what I’ve become
The fear of many niggas
The floss of most bitches
The love that runs deepest In the hearts of street niggas
Raised in the ghetto
By the ghetto
Was taught young to pop the medal
That’s how shit get settled
Learn to cook up the coke
Never leave home without toast
Learn to fly my bitches with birds not coats
Never trust ya
From a tight blood to hustla
I was trained as a youngsta
To cock back and slug ya
Love me or hate me
Ya only son
Let me live or kill me
The chosen one
Ja, under the gun gotta kill ‘em for show
If you want it you gonna get more then you askin for
Lifes got more to come
But when its all said and done
You lost one love
Your only begotten son

Chorus (2X)

I wanted to be forever yours
Lookin now but nothin wrong
Two souls
Lookin to meet at the cross roads
I burn the hydro
Lay back with my eyes closed
In deep thought like Brittany is somethin I’d die for
Well how the fuck do you sleep at night
Knowin you wrong the only thing you ever did right
Despite the loss I stretch the length of a short
Now I got a new father whose name is New York
Runnin wild in the streets In heat we don’t talk
Cause when its cold you basically live life in the dark
When light would shine from the heavens
And bless one Ja Rule loved
Your only begotten son

Chorus (3X)
