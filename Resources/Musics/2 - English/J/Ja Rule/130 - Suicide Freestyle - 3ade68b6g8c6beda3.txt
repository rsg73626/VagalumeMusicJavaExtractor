SUICIDE FREESTYLE

Ummm, Say all that I want to do Is to live my life
Ummm, but everytime I turn around
Another nigga dies Niggas catchin five to ten years
And it just ain’t no use Uhh, uhh, ever heard of a nigga dying twice
My love is just to live my life Till the Lord decides to out my lights
Oh I know why niggas ain’t prepared to die with me
But we all got to die one day
Even though the life has captured me
Money, drugs and prisons, menages with women
Forgive me God for living For I have sinned
Now everybody wanna cage me in
Don’t make no difference cause I’m still here
Breathing, can I get a witness?
My life is misleading, hey Hety, cause anybody wanna fuck with me
Come on just grab your heart my niggas
Don’t ever doubt your niggas
What’s life without my niggas?

Talk to my niggas heart to heart
We all live from hustlin’ to ballin’
It’s crime we fall in Feds keep a lens peakin’ through the Venetians
But secret indictments Ya’ll niggas is reachin’
C’mon I’m in the business to break niggas
And anybody that want it get it hot from the INC. niggas
Ja Rule ready to kill niggas
Bury ‘em all Lookin to laythem down big to small
Got the world in awe ‘cause I’m spittin’ the raw
Never seen, never heard before but truly yours
I’ma max out on niggas doin 2 to 4’s
Bang a nigga in the yard then get a hit at the Board
Just because a nigga don’t give a fuck get weeded and Hennied up
Still the ball out be nuts Since you keeping
in touch feel the guns bust for sure if you want any more Uncore.
