I'M REAL (MURDA MIX)

(what's my mother fuckin name)
R-U-L-E
(Blowin back on this mary jane i'm analyzin the game)
and the game done chose me
(To bring pain to pussy niggaz and pussy hoes, it's one in the same)
ever since u told me 
(theres only room for two, I've been makin less room 4 u)
Now only God can hold me
(Hug me,love me, judge me the only man that helo is above me, holla)

i met so many men and
it's like their all the same 
My appetite for lovin'
is now my hunger pain

And when i'm feelin sexy
who's gonna come for me
My only problem is 
their insecurity

[Ja Rule]
Girl, I've been thinkin bout this relationship
and i wanna know is this as good as it gets
cause we've been through the worst times and the best times 
but it was our times even if it was part-time

but not knowin', ever growin and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin and straight thuggin

Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey

But still don't fuck with ur baby

[Jennifer Lopez](Ja Rule)Repeat 2

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hatin' me, treatin' me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me 
My life I live it to the limit and I love it 
Now i can breathe again baby now i can breathe again

Now people screamin' what the deal with u and so and so
I tell them niggaz to mind the biz, but they don't hear me though
Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it 
Now i can breathe again baby now i can breathe again

Repeat 1
