FUCK FAME

"Fame (Intro)"
(feat. Leah Siegal)

[Narrator]
Previously, on "Pain Is Love"

[police sirens] [church bell gongs]
[chopper soars] [police photographer]

[Ja Rule]
Here we go again baby
Erase the pain
Gotta break free from all this
motherfuckin... anxiety, strains on my life
Open my eyes and see
It's a big world out there
If God could only...
shine his light on me

[Ja Rule - singing]
I'm crying everyone's tears, my pain, my love
I'm crying everyone's tears...

[Narrator]
And now, "PIL 2"

[Chorus: Leah Siegal]
And the world was so cold; I couldn't recognize myself [2X]
So I took a little (PIL), and it changed my whole world
Said I want a view, so I had to take two
{FUCK FAME}

[Ja Rule]
Picasso, Rembrandt, Basquiat
Warhol couldn't paint a better work of art
And I'm like a child in all black
Cause I tried to brainwash it, we can't man, dog is back
Elephant's in the room paint it retro
Here's a Van Gogh, but y'all don't hear me though
I'm what you never saw, but somethin you never seen
You motherfuckers can't see me, can't see

[Chorus]
