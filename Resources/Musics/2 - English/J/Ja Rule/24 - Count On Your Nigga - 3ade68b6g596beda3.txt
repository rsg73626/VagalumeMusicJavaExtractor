COUNT ON YOUR NIGGA

Uh, yeah It’s Ja Rule nigga
Uh, uh, yeah
Feel this Uh, Ja Rule nigga Def Jam, Ja

Look at my life style it’s dangerous
When I was young this sorta life was contagious
Hustlin’ hard like them sharks down in Vegas
My gat and I come bust spontaneous
This world made us to take only what they gave us
The game is our loss
Watch yo gloat
Then show you that this world ain’t yours
Push crack like swingin’ doors
And leave strips wide open Ja’s holdin
A pair a nines and ya’ll cats foldin’
My life ain’t been all that goldin’
This ryme hit me at a young age and kept callin’
I know I’m fallin’
To the evil of money and drugs and loose woman
But that’s what I’m lovin’ about livin’
Bein I see my birth as agivin’ Knowin’ my inner limits
This game ain’t no scrimmage
Lets play big we’re winners
Beg the Lord for forgiveness
For when I die please take me off your shit list
Cause I’ll be nameless
Puttin’ them through changes
The J to the A Niggas know the flows crazy

Chorus:
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It’s evident who’s out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Were we goin’ in life figure
There’s no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
(Repeat 2x)

I got a lust for this money
Admire them old timers
Assume with no conscience
Made a world so chaotic
Opened up my mind and introduced me to narcotics
Brand new wips not this thicks the hottest chicks
I just can’t seem to keep them off my dicks
The difference is ya’ll did ya’ll thing on the low
Made a lot of doe We did our thing high pro
Though we still blew I wish I knew dirty money was evil
I never understood until I lost a few people
Dead and gone still their memory lives on
Throw a mural up let them niggas whem was loved
Now were in to better things
Got our hands on every ring
Crime in the streets
Cause it’s my time I draw the line between love and war really
Nigga you with me Your flossin, outside that you fear me
Literally strait up and down with no cross
As God is my witness and JA is yours I’m a spirit in your direction
Hit the floors, Nigga

Chorus:
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It’s evident who’s out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Were we goin’ in life figure
There’s no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
(Repeat 2x)

Chorus:

And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It’s evident who’s out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Were we goin’ in life figure
There’s no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
(Repeat 2x)
