[Nas]
My enemies want sorta the same respect I was born with
Godson, tatted on my chest its permanent
The rap [album] Anastasia
You cowards y'all want the crown from the black power man of asia
Snap out your dreams and prayers of takin a kings paper
Ask that other rapper how it feels to lose his whole gangsta
(How it feel man?)
You'z a no namesta - ya little mans is no threat
You make me upset I might stay (b-b-b-blastin)

Inc is the Murder Ill Will merger wit my cash
Make sex with yo cast it can't hurt us
Phones ringing off the hook
Bullshit, Bloomberg calling me Cosby
Streets wanna know the cause of tha gossip

Nas was born in the projects till the coffins drop
In the ocean like a Amistad, slave overboating em
Its a new day y'all should be scared I'm back wit style
South side, queensbridge, the hoods in here

[Chorus - Ashanti (Nas)]
There's no me (uh talk to me) without you (It's no me y'all)
I can't be (I.N.C.) without you (Ill will now)
Don't you know that I will never leave (talk to me yeah) leave you
(it's no me y'all) All I need (I.N.C.) need is you

There's no me... 

[Ja Rule]
Yeah - 

[Nas]
B-b-b-blastin'...blastin...blastin...blastin

[Ja Rule]
Lemme talk to these niggaz gotti
Yeah - What up Suge

[Ashanti (Nas)]
It's murda (Ashanti) for life

[Ja Rule]
And lord knows I'd DIE
I Pledge allegience to homicide
And murdah be the case when I kill 'em 
WHY would they get a nigga like me started
I'm regarded the hardest workin artist since Pac NIGGAZ
And I ain't talkin if I'm like or better
I'm talkin if he was here we'd probly ride together
On this chick ass nigga with curls, bitch dog
Get at me dog - Rule nigga the boss

You always been a pup now, well aint it a pity
That you running to IG, dying to be me
But I pledge I.N.C. and for the love
I'll bleed it in blood and die from hot slugs - motherfuckers

[Chorus]

[Ashanti]
Murdah I.N.C. - You know that I can't see myself
Livin without you, being without you, breathing without you baby
What you've done to me, you know that I can't see myself
Livin without you, being without you, breathing without you baby

[Chorus x 2, ad-libs by Ashanti]

[Tupac(?), Ashanti, Nas]
Ashanti: There's no me
Nas: B-b-b-blastin'...blastin...blastin..blastin
Tupac: You shall not fear no man but God...though I walk through the valley of 
death
Ashanti: Don't you know that I will
Tupac: ...far away, Please God won't you grant me the strength to 
[unintelligible]
