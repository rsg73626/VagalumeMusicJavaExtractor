DADDY'S LITTLE BABY

It's my heart
Brittany 

Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never cuz I'm teaching you better 
Life ain't all about cheddar diamonds and leather
Understand you a black sister, in this white man's 
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who
Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black too strong beautiful
Tell the truth let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat
So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you daddy's little baby yea

[Chorus]

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever


Yo Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and its chemistry 
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise don't cry just, hold on 
Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on 
The day you was born God answered my cry for help 
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22 
God' whats the science in this sign you grew
I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready 
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
Fo real

[Chorus]


When I look in yo eyes I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel through the storm has just begun
Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five 
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
Fo real
