GREY BOX (SKIT)

[Rule:] yeah yeah, hold up, hold up, hold up.
What the fuck do you want before I open up this grey
box?
[Girl:] Nigga, you know what I want.
I want that x.
[Rule:] yeah, but what kind you want?
You want the white booties, you want the
green nikes, you want the Calvin Kleins,
you want the Versaces.
You know I got it all.
Please believe that.
You, how high you wanna fly?
