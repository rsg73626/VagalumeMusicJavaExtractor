COCKY

Cocky-Kid Rock

Guess who's back
I used to be broke
Confused
No Joke
Got used
Smoked Dope
Paid Dues
Refused
To give up quick
Now there's 10 Million Motherfuckers on my dick
Sold what
Say how
Say who
Fuck what
Fuck me
Fuck you
Come clean
You know I will
Drink a fifth of Jim Beam
And still stand still
I'm the illest fool
Cooler than the water in a swimming pool
Fly like a seagull
Kickin' like a mule
More jams than a Beatle from Liverpool
I deliver fool
Who the fuck are you
I'm Kid motherfuckin' Rock
From the old school
Got more money
Than Matchbox 20
Get more ass
Than Mark McGrath

(Chorus)

They say I'm cocky
And I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky
And I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up

I'm from the outskirts of Detroit Rock City
A-Shirts
Cadillac
Big titties
Skinny models
You can keep those
I like big corn fed Midwestern ho's
Don't you know
Talk fast
Pimp slow
Show up Z black ties
In t-shirts & slippers
Sippin' liquor, fuck models
Love strippers, known 9's
The big tipper with the big dipper
I got queer holding key to my zipper
Fuck a real good girl
I've got the baddest bitch in the world

(Chorus)

You think you got it good
In Hollywood
I got acres of land
Laid back in the woods
Holdin' shares
Cool like Fonzie
Rollin' Lake St. Clair
In my forty foot Donzie
You got a Bentley
Wow
I got jets with wet bars
And trucks with gold plows
Bitch bow when I pimp thru
For the Kid, the Rock
The Red, White and Blue
Who knew the Kid would be
Everything from old George Jones to Jazz

Are you scared
Cause when the Kid's in the house
Better come prepared
And I swear
I'm sick
Of getting ripped off
So pissed
About to be pissed off
Mackin' me
Cause you know I'm paid
That's why I'm slappin' my gardeners
And fuckin' my maids
Never mind my age
But if we're taking numbers
15 million sold motherfucker

They say I'm cocky
And I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky
And I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
Cocky
And I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky
And I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
