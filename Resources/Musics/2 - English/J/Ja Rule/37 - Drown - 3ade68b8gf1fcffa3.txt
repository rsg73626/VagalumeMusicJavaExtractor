DROWN

Please don't let me drown drown drown(I'm so cold)
Please don't let me drown drown drown(Don't let me drown)
Please don't let me drown drown drown(I'm so cold)
Please don't let me
Please don't let me

Yes sir
They fought me

I'm going in the downer shape
Into the darker days
Please don't let me drown (drown)
All life was fatally
The burst of your judgment day
Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x)

Drown drown drown
Lord let me take it both water like the French quarter
I'm so walker now
I'm overlooking the ocean
From the deck of the yacht the view's gorgeous
They have the shark in the waters
But is the few who's among us
Nigger, they wanna bite like piranha
I overflow near DiCaprio
I'm top ten bigger than life the aura
If this ship sink nigger I'm gonna walk on water
Gigantic but Jesus I'm of the Christian manic
How do I manage? To be above average and not ever again
To be the one to dive in knowing I can't swim
For me to go under not breathing
I'm drowning

I'm going in the downer shape
Into the darker days
Please don't let me drown (drown)
All life was fatally
The burst of your judgment day
Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x)

Pray for me cuz I tested positive
For being the shit now niggers won't touch me
And I'm allergic to broke niggers, trust me
Independent, been in the blood since a youngun
So I'm thinking there ain't no cure for my illness
And the diagnose is just something I could live with
Cause I'd have make it rain on bitches, storm on niggers
Cash flow like rivers (Please don't let me drown)
The drifting it wasn't enough for me
To be in the deepest of waters, to feel like I'm snorkeling
Off shore and this so reassuring
That I'm still sick, in need of a donor
Cuz I'm heartless, so I dive in
No life vest, knowing I can't swim
So if I go under and I'm breathing
Am I drowning?

I'm going in the downer shape
Into the darker days
Please don't let me drown (drown)
All life was fatally
The burst of your judgment day
Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x)

This is the story of a girl (pray)
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world (they fought me)
I told her cry me a river, little mama don't give up
Daddy's here to deliver, the world is cold
So them tears you can tie them up
Just don't wanna let â€˜em running down your face
Baby the world is frozen
I told her if she shared it with me then it'd be ours
Like anything you maw
How can you give and drown?
Under water I can't hear a sound but I
See the rain dropping like tears from god am I
Mother's telling me that it's a sign of wealth
When I don't think the lord is too fond of her
But there's gotta be a reason
I'm not drowning, right?

I'm going in the downer shape
Into the darker days (kill my lights in here baby)
Please don't let me drown (drown)
All life was fatally(it's black out now)
The burst of your judgment day
Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x)
Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x)
