SPUN A WEB

[Intro]
Love thy hater
You know they say everything we hear is an opinion not fact
And everything we see is perspective not truth
The fewer the facts the stronger the opinions
And opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance, bitch

[Verse 1]
I’m hoping in heaven got a ghetto
So when I get there I can tell you to smile whole hearted
I’m back where I started
I’m prisoner of my own success
But hardly caring enough to know that I’m dead without it
No cribs, no cars, no champagne
No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage
But f-ck it I’m in a better place
And I’m talking in third person in case you couldn’t relate
Diary of a monster
Sometimes my mind fades to a place not even I can explain
Cause theres a thin line between genius and insane
Guess which one I am, I think it’s obvious that

[Chorus]
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, And I say that to say this
Man if life is a bitch I’m gon f-ck her then tell her that I love her
Not beneath her or above her but inside no rubber
Thats my interpretation of mutherfcker
No lie, no truth my life is a little bit of both
Who’s who, who knows anymore
My choice is to get it in real moist so I can come hard
And the world is ours, better yet bitch mines
Shot at the moon just to be among stars
Then God alienated it and ended up on mars
Serenity understand it extraterrestrial that I is
Think I do it all because it’s obvious

[Chorus]
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

[Verse 3]
Yeah, uh huh
Let me, I’m seeing my whole life ahead of me
And I’m feeling like this life can never be (naaah)
Cause a nigga on a whole nother pedigree
I’m so far from home it feels like a million miles
And I’m long gone and ain’t no coming back
But really I never left
I’ve been silent yet at my the best
Ya’ll haters spread hatred like ?
And I still find ways to make crochet hearts
Like Kanye my 808′s is heartbreakers
Maybe me singing to your heats a mistake
Nah, Maybe I’m just before my time
Or maybe it’s just that obvious

[Chorus]
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
