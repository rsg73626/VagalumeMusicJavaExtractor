[Ja Rule]

[Ja Rule]
Y’all mother fuckers think it’s a game right?
Get da name right R-U-L-E baby
My shit is airtight Compressed, dead all da non-sense
Pass da 4-5th and load up the cartridge E Reved up da 6
We about to blow out like bitchez wit bad kidz
Once u feelin da slugz hit Datz as real as it gets
Then you wonda
Why da quake can come from unda-neath,
while you figure it out You on da streetz
Laid out wit da gun still stuck in yo mouth
Fuckin wit Ja is suttin Niggaz fearfully doubt
Cuz I don’t give a fuck I don’t give a fuck,
God may ask from yo prayer so my soul don’t die
These is real tears I cried And dreamz don’t lie
When they tell me dat I’m doin good in da devilz eyez
But I preach to Ima be dat same, Nigga put da heat to Im
Askin E Dub what da fuck you wan do to Im

[E-Dub]
E-Dub and Ja An eye for an eye,
Gat for a gat Peep game,
Cover the mic and spit flamez
Two cats who come strapped, self contained
Ain’t shit this raw since
Big Daddy Kane, Heavyweight,
I knock a Nigga out in two Put him to sleep,
see dreamz and swear it wasn’t true
Look at you, lame, I’m iller, rhyme killa,
Comin thru like da return of Godzilla

[Ja Rule]
Ja and E-Dub Now can I tell ya
E and Ja top doggz, Def Squad,
Fuckin wit us is like, suicide,
Bow down, real niggaz on da move

Cuz we are, livin life
Thug style, Hennessy, Blazin treez,
Getting G’s, indeed,
Cuz we will do or die
Right now by any meanz
Words is bond word is bond

[Ja Rule]
Ain’t nobody touchin da ground dat I walk on
My love, It’s just so strong
If you crossin me you dead wrong
And you know cuz you feel it in yo heart, nigga
And you don’t sleep cuz yo soul might fall apart, nigga
If you feelin me now
The strength got you settlin down
We puttin in work
In otha words we puttin in roundz
Take two for now Ja and E-Dub
Strictly for the love
We fuck hoez and bust slugz, Nigga
Why in da world would you put me in da position
To put niggaz out of commission, love, willin and wishin
Cuz I’m feelin the need to cut off da air dat you breathe
By any means it's Ja and E no in betweens

[E-Dub]

[Ja Rule]
Now what I love is to see my niggaz on top
And I feel that we can’t be stopped
And my life don’t mean shit to me
But my life gon make history
Feel me, a nigga ain’t supposed to be

Respect me, cuz we livin dangerously
Luv me, cuz y’all can’t even Fuck wit me
