CHRIS BLACK (SKIT)

Chris Black (Skit)                (One of us) Yeah, Rule 
(One uf us) Yeah, nigga If God were one of us (One of us) What about that? 
What if he was? What if he was me? (One of us) What the fuck would I do? 
Lord, when I die pacify, crucify me 
I rock a Devil cross, one's for the soul one's for the body 
If I'm built then God dies, I wanna see God cry 
Real tears from a burned out life in ten years 
I sware I got the Devil in me, with no fear 
If I hear I can't see, if I can't see I can't hear 
It's the eerie little thing between deathness and blindness 
Weakness and kindness, rejects and primaz 
I'm on this when I'm hollerin' "Dear, Lord take me" (One of us) 
'Cuz I ain't really happy here, can you blame me? 
It's game done changed me, made me an animal 
I can't even laugh no more, my kids plot for me now 
I'm the one-and-only, my momma's only child Lord, save me before I go crazy 
'Cuz if you, live through the strangest To die from the pain 
Tell me, would you believe that you could breathe again? (Chorus) 
If God were one of us (One of us) Would he sin and love to lie? I wanna know 
If God were one of us (One of us) Would he freakin' live his life? I wanna know 
If God were one of us (One of us) Would he use his name in vain? I need to know 
If God were one of us (One of us) Would he believe that he could breathe again? 
Yo, yo Now let's look at things from a right hand Would if you was that man 
Would you run wit me? Gun wit me? 
Would you understand the husstlin', the struggeling 
Livin' the most dope heads, raisin' your kids and runnin' from the Feds 
We'd be bound to bump heads, 'cuz you livin' my life 
All righteous, and you said Liberacci's was right 
But there's two sides to life - one dark, one light 
If you lighten up forever you can dig to the night 
Wrap them guns over there, and bring 'em on ova' here (One of us) 
'Cuz my God is bigger down your god down here 
Now we ride jet sled baby, bubble in Ba-Namb 
'Cuz Rule and the Lord got it goin' on 
Been, know to do, bad shit, I'm so heavenly, butt so devilish 
If, you, live through the strangest to die from the pain, tell me 
Would you believe that you could breathe again? (Chorus) Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yo 
Let's trade places, Rule be Spirit, God be flesh 
And let's see just how, weak the flesh gets 
Now you call on me, "Every night bend your knee" 
Until your start to realize I ain't answerin' 
Now you hang up the phone, Lord, pick up the chrome, Lord 
Can I blame you, Lord, for needin'a feed Washores 
Got a wife that you love, yet you still lust whores 
And I'm supposted to judge you, on earth where it's ugly 
You might as well aim at the sky, slug me (One of us) 
'Cuz I ain't bein' a Fair God, when life is so hard 
I know what'cha goin' through, every move you make 
Every crime commited every little mistake I still got love for ya, fair is fair 
As long as you repent you'll be good up here (Baby) 
'Cuz if you live through the, strangest to die from the pain, tell me 
Would you believe that you could breathe again? (Chorus) x4 Yeah, uhh
