BACK WHERE I BELONG

[LL Cool J Talking] 
Yo, yea, aight after this particular practice run 
I'ma practice both verses, after this, I want you to find a spot 
That's close to when the beat drops to the rewind point, locate point 
You ain't gotta be on that all night, this the soundtrack 
Yo, Yea, Check it 
ok, alright, huh ok 

[Verse 1]

Ballin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time

You hit a hot one in every city on the map 
And niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back 
You know better than the gat, but niggas still wanna clap 

[Chorus-2x][Ja Rule] 
It feels so good to be back Where I Belong 
The Streets is Where I Belong 
They Had me locked down much too long 
Hey Hey 

[Verse 2] 
Some Say "L that's cool, but see times have changed" 
Niggas got red bandanas, and the grill in the range 
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains 
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne 
Hustling niggas found they way into the game 
Extorting all these so called ballers wi
