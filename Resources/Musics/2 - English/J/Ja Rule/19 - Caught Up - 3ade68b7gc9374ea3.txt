CAUGHT UP

[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Word to mother, my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards
Holla back ... hey Terry you gon' be big boy
Y'knahmsayin? ... aiyyo, aiyyo Jody
Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit, get that bottle of Voo
Out the back of the back for me baby
I need to get right before I do this here
Uh huh

[Chorus - Lloyd] + (Alexus)
(Why me and you)
Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up
(What we been through)
It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feelin you)
And I'm feelin we should both be free
(If we were through)
Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Mami I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged, but you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been callin me ever since, to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creepin to ten
And now your my lucky quarter, the days get shorter, lights get longer
You know when the weather is cold, feelings grow stronger
Wanna perform her, your pussy feel like walkin pneumonia
Got me snifflin, sneezin, coughin, and achin and shit
And I'm startin to think I'm fallin in love with this bitch
I'm havin dreams about her jeans and how they fit
... in that Urban Jeffrey baby tee
She's wearin my name already, so you know she's fuckin me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is ... shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Ja Rule]
Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing "Dangerously In Love" and ... this a dangerous broad I'm fuckin
Like Al it's the "Scent of a Woman"
That got me playin hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intrudin, I don't mean to be rude, but our situation is kinda amusin
Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggaz can't tell us, what we been doin is wrong
And your girl's gettin jealous, cause we been gettin along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion, in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is ..

[Chorus]

[Break - Lloyd]
Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
Been held like I hold ya?
Been loved like I love ya?
Be real, be real
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be real, be real

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Girl your my (Alexus: sunshine), but sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?
Them sunny days, I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya face
It'd be great to get up every morning to eggs and steak
But you can't relate, so we separated on good terms
No one's concerned, about who ya been fuckin, and who ya fucked last
But when I see you, still the question I ask is ..

[Chorus] - 2X
