RAIN ON ME [REMIX]

[Intro:Ashanti]
Yeah
Murder Inc.
We invite you to? epic, ya know?
We make music out of a sense of hunger
Sort of a desire
Through that desire
We expose the pain and struggle
But we accustom to live it
So, we feel without this music, we have nothing
So we offer you, well? we offer you our lives
So how you gon' take it?

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
See everybody wanna rise to the top these days
[Top these days]
A lot of people might come and try to take your place
[Take your place]
Oh you know that
All you gotta do is keep rising, rising
Don't look back and keep shining, shining
I had a little struggle
I had a little pain
Now make it rain, make it rain, make it rain

[Verse: 2 Rap Charli Baltimore]

[Chorus:]
Rain on me (rain on me)
Lord wont you take this
Pain from me
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breath till you just
Rain on me (rain on me)
Lord wont you take this
Pain from me
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breath yeah

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
I stop and think how life could be so raw
[Be so raw]
Sometimes I just don't wanna fight no more
[Fight no more]
Oh you know just
All you gotta do is keep rising, rising
Don't look back and keep shining, shining
I had a little struggle
I had a little pain
Now make it rain, make it rain, make it rain

[Rap]

[Chorus:]
Rain on me (rain on me)
Lord wont you take this
Pain from me
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breath till you just
Rain on me (rain on me)
Lord wont you take this
Pain from me
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breath yeah

[Verse 3: Rap Ja Rule]

[Chorus:]
Rain on me (rain on me)
Lord wont you take this
Pain from me
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breath till you just
Rain on me (rain on me)
Lord wont you take this
Pain from me
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breath yeah

[Ending: Ashanti]
Rain down on me
Oh, wont you take this
Pain from me
Oh wont you make it
Rain down on me
Lord wont you take this pain from me
