I WONDER

[Intro: Ja Rule (R. Kelly)]
(oooh)
Yeah, you know
(oh, oh-oh-ooohh)
I wonder sumtimes, you know?
(oooooohh)
The person, that i am
(oohoohoh)
Gettin that money, you know? hehe

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Ja Rule) {both}]
If it wasn't fo the money, cars, the home, the jewels, the baggs
That shows bout me and you I wonder (if you still be wanting me)
I wonder (if you still be calling me)
{still be loving me}

It's tha star that knows tha rules somehow to move girl
Bout me and you i wonder (if you still be wanting me)
I wonder (if you still be calling me)
{still be loving me}

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I know you been loking faint
Trips to the sedan and make up that max
Hair freshly done, but I'm not tha one
Unleash you to want through me
Can you get it fronting like cover as long as we
Have to go through the honor where we forcing me
And, we can meet getting by the event to see
I been treaten, til the fiend got popped out
Front but not leasening
Ma got money to burn
I feed nails, weeves 'n' purse
And beyond bad, that body works
And love many skirts
If you want to, i get you by me
With skirts to try you to work
To dare our words, ??
And, what do you believe in?
Money or god?
Sum say god is money
I say life is hard
I say love, cause i, i wonder....

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Ja Rule) {both}]
If it wasn't fo the money, cars, the home, the jewels, the baggs
That shows bout me and you I wonder (if you still be wanting me)
I wonder (if you still be calling me)
{still be loving me}

It's eha star that knows the rules somehow to move girl
Bout me and you i wonder (if you still be wanting me)
I wonder (if you still be calling me)
{still be loving me}

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
We always say, its so good
But I be like with it
Be this good and wasn't who I was
I'm up +in the club+ buyin out tha bar
And blowin like bomber and all eyes is on me
They drove sticks, so i guess im comin
To find the fatest and is cashin on me
Money can't buy love but it show cops moanin
In the moment in the whole scene usin a pack of wholin
The rest of the fingers is frozen, is fridgin
My pack is look like carying them midgets
To make ya go fast like su-cops sillies
And its like years to keep on shiverin
From the rich to the richest lifestyle and the faimless
Causin lose on gangstas and its armed and dangerous
If i was a picture unpainted
Would you love me if you still framing, he, i wonder....

[Chorus (w/ ad libs of R. Kelly): R. Kelly (Ja Rule) {both}]
If it wasn't fo tha money, cars, tha home, tha jewels, tha baggs
That shows bout me and you I wonder (if ya still be wanting me)
I wonder (if ya still be calling me)
{still be loving me}

It's tha star that knows tha rules somehow to move girl
Bout me and you i wonder (if you still be wanting me)
I wonder (if you still be calling me)
{still be loving me}

[Bridge: Ja Rule {both}]
Baby girl, if there wasnt no money
{and your home be gone}
Would you still love me?
{or be so gone?}

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Thats what i never know
And dope keeps hittin
And after a relationship and there could also be trippin
And it aint all bout sex and we talkin the position
And any women ??
I'M RICH!!
Not to mention givin her real hair
Like i and you fail her life
Its ya nail and vibin and be loopin
And thats why i be trippin ya like ima shoot ya
I know what ya used to
Baby you gotta be tha finest
Just to know the top name designed it
And i make my promise, just not bein flawless
Ima buy you a few thangs throwin a few dollars
If i wasnt, livin up in a star, would ya holla?, i wonder....

[Chorus (w/ ad libs of R. Kelly): R. Kelly (Ja Rule) {both}]
If it wasn't fo tha money, cars, tha home, tha jewels, tha baggs
That shows bout me and you I wonder (if ya still be wantin me)
I wonder (if ya still be callin me)
{still be lovin me}

It's tha star that knows tha rules somehow to move girl
Bout me and you i wonder (if ya still be wantin me)
I wonder (if ya still be callin me)
{still be lovin me}

[Outro]
Ohh, oh-ohoho

Oh-ohoh
