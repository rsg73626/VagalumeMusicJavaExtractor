6 FEET UNDERGROUND

Chorus

The Lord is callin me, my demons haunt me,
this world it tortures me, cause they don’t understand me.
And while I’m holdin up, I know you smiling down
and all my enemies who wanna see me
(six feet underground).

Look at me know, hittin them up holdin them down,
cause I’m destined to be, I know you love to see me
(six feet underground).
Why, see through the devils eyes, you vision my demise,
so may your soul lie
(six feet underground).
Never before did I believe that I could fly mo’, just getting high,
my niggas just getting by.
If you can’t see we benzes ya’ll jags we rollies ya’ll tags,
we diamonds ya’ll glass,we get pussy ya’ll ass.
Gimme love, we be wearin guns tighter than gloves,
with special 38 snubs, so we don’t end up
(six feet underground).
The pressure hittin em’, the rule will still get rid of them,
for those who feel they getting away, Ja be sendin them
(six feet underground).
I feel I’m cursed-mind, body, and soul-ive been outta control,
ever since I fell in a zone.
And want nuttin more than to see my niggas eat with me,
but my enemies want nuttin more than to see me
(six feet underground).

Chorus (2x)

The Lord is callin me, my demons haunt me,
this world it tortures me, cause they don’t understand me.
And while I’m holdin up, I know you smiling down
and all my enemies who wanna see me
(six feet underground).

I’m so ignorant, cause I done bled my last tears,
and pain is bliss, been through so many things.
It’s hard to assist, a mind that’s currently thinkin on i
ts last wits, is nuthin to fuck with.
When I, know what I’m up against you must think I’m a fool,
claimin you love what I do, then be down playin the rule.
Bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels,
and I love nuttin more than to see you
(six feet underground).
Doesn’t matter how we, gonna get at em’ while we,
gonna get at em’,
and don’t--------but we sure gone send em’.
Love em’ or leave em’, niggas created a demon,
let it open so I won’t be goin’
(six feet underground).
Because I’m cursed-mind, body,
and soul-ive been outta control, ever since I fell in a zone.
And want nuttin more than to see my niggas eat with me,
but my enemies want nuttin more than to see me
(six feet underground).

Chorus (2x)

The Lord is callin me, my demons haunt me,
this world it tortures me, cause they don’t understand me.
And while I’m holdin up, I know you smiling down
and all my enemies who wanna see me
(six feet underground).

Get up, get up, get up, get up baby the rule can’t die tonite,
nowall my niggas is ya’ll wit me?! Yeaheeyeah,
and all my bitches is ya’ll wit me?! Yeaheeyeah,
Just thoughi’d warn you, that I ain’t livin right,
niggas might see my life, as sort of a sacrifice,
money, bitches and ice, but fuck it. Roll, roll wit sumthin,
let me sip sumthin. Ride 1-2-5 in a low-low frontin,
in 3 wheel motion, you know I’m high, flickin ashes at police while ridin by.
I’m ghetto, ------- fear is runnin deeper than love,
if you wanna get it, then come on nigga get it in blood,
Because I’m feelin cursed-mind, body,
and soul-ive been outta control, ever since I fell in a zone.
And want nuttin more than to see my niggas eat with me,
but my enemies want nuttin more than to see me
(six feet underground).
