Ja Rule & Vita:
Yo (we murderers, baby)

(chorus)
Ja Rule & Vita:
I be running and gunning them down(we murderers, baby)
Leave me or love me now (I´m here for you baby)
Anywhere, anyhow (I´ll ryde for you baby)
You and I together, and we blast forever
(2x)


Ja Rule:
Ja´s the dream and nigga´s wake up and sweats its about
horse head in your bed, nigga
gun your mouth
potty it out
wrong nigga,
spit one more thang and have your hood pouring out liqour
cause my niggas run through lesbians
niggas, that act like brawds
feel the strip and thus be gone
hold up, nigga that done spread up
you might wanna keep in touch with the murderers
cause we, the murderers I.N.C.
is above yall niggas, it´s the lord in me
and we can never be at a love´s lost
but you, showed me love ain´t boss
feel the force,
this young horse,
known as rule
gave more paper to jigga for my ewls
and lord knows ain´t no pussy going to stop my flow
I don´t love you hoes, I´m out the door


(Chorus 2x)


Vita:
you that motherfucking bitch, Vita nigga
you want me to ryde you nigga
Clap up and hide you nigga
been beside my niggas for this long
I´m keeping my head right and tight and doe long
I can go on, about shit I´ve been through
transponed, keys are in too
shit I got issues
if I pop a bitch
then she probably a snitch
L-A-V-I-T-A-A-A-K-A Taday Vallet shit
When my niggas from my bitches
sold drugs from niggas to the murderes
I´m the bitch, sometimes i even spit on chicks
cause in the clubes, i say criss, and I piss the shit, baby
I know your brawds been feeling me, lately, now livin and lay
cause i touch them with gun blades, dark is us
any light, shine, we bust,
Vita, Gotti and Rule, we make up the murderers


(Chorus 2x)


Vita:
The reasons why I pop between the lie
be the same reasons I clap off the nines
Roll up on bronx, like, who da hot bitch
and stock, with some sweats, humpin out on sixth


Ja Rule:
That´s it, go head baby, floss out bitches,
but me, i´m continue to clap niggas,
strike and heavy hitters that, play the field, reveal,
pull that weapon and re-keep the seal

Vita & Ja Rule:
It´s murder to the end (I´ts murder for life)
Only Jesus Christ made us a strong sacrifice
these niggas I die for, lies to the fed form,
set out these bitch niggas, I pick them in bad form

Ja Rule:
Baby, I´m long gone, but I´m loyal
for the love that you show your bitches
and spread to your thugs
And they tongues get slugged
When the fucking wit us
you crazy, that´s why (We Murderers baby!)


(Chorus 2x)
