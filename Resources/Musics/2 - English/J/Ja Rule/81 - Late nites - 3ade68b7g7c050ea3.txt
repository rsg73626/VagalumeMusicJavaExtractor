LATE NITES

Late nights goin down, here I am again.
Emptiness is my only friend.
Playin with emotions breakin up time,
baby baby on my mind.

Here I am, one more time
and your sweet face is on my mind
(On my mind)
Got no where to go, nothin to do
all i do is think about you, you, you
(Here I go again..)
Loneliness here I go..
(My only friend..)
I am so alone.

Here I go again, sittin up alone
Layin in the dark no one's home.
Cryin til it hurts,
bleedin til I die..
give me one reason.. why.
