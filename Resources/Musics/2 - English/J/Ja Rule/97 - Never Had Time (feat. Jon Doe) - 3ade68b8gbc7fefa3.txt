NEVER HAD TIME (FEAT. JON DOE)

[Jon Doe]
Between the lights and the cameras, 
The trips from New York to Paris 
It seems I never could manage to say that I, I never had time 
Living my life on the road, and every city is home,
I should have picked up the phone 
And say that I, I never had time 
I never had the time, the time I need to stay,
There was... one for me 

[Ja Rule]
Everybody you was said you was shit, girl, 
How you ride, the d*ck girl,
The one I'm really trying to get with girl 
Not once, but kinda like a refill 
I feel, can it get any better,... gonna make my... 
Spread it on bruschetta
We've been around the world seen these bitches won't shut up 
How did we meet... I've been wonderful,
Wanted to experience real love 
I really wanna explore love, I just never had time 

[Jon Doe]
I never had time, time I need to stay,
There was... one for me 
Living my life on the road, and every city is home,
I should have picked up the phone 
And say that I, I never had time 

[Ja Rule]
Let it rain, let in rain 
Rain down on me 
I've been really trying to be someone I never been 
Trying to visualize something I never seen 
And if I can't see it, how could it ever be? 
I'm just trying to be more than a memory 
I pray 
Remember me, miss me when I'm gone 
18 months ain't that long 
I need to get away from it all 
The niggas, the bitches, the bizness 
Like Drake say, the hardest part is minding your own 
F*ck em all, bilingual, money call 
I'm on the bitch with my feet up,
Money call 
The sad part about it though 
I wanted you to be here 
I just never took to say so 
I kinda think you was waiting on my call 
I just never had time

It seems I never I never can manage to say that I,

Living my life on the road, and every city is home,
I should have picked up the phone 
And say that I (I never had time)
I never had time, time I need to stay,
There was... one for me 

[Ja Rule]
If I'll never get the chance to say, them 3 words so famous 
Or infamous, depending how you go through 
Me myself, I'm more... I'm here, but never there for the... 
Especially know how we still do it... 
So selfish, but so... 
If there's anything you learn from this is 
Don't let your feelings... I wish I would have told you 
Never had time

I never had time, time I need to stay,
There was... 1 for 3
