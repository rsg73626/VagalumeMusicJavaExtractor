Hey Ja rule
Rule Baby.. Brazil



I know you're looking at me
but there is something to see
something special that you can't deny
You've got my dreams
Can't let them fade
I wanna show the world that i can make it right,
right..

There is go some kind another 
(I think about this at it all)
Don't matter what you say about me
( I saw my way into the top)
This is my life
(This is for you)
You wanna try me I'll sent off
I' ve been feel so many things
(This is the way I've been)
Made me the girl I'm
(You know my history)
You know that I will keep searching for something more

Refrão
And I'll fly
I'll sing the way I feel
And I'll fly
I'll show you that i'm real
And I'll fly
The time changed my mind
Come and let me take you on this ride
I've seen your world so let me show you mine

If you can see, there is a such a thing
as a perfetion that you want for me
Just look around you, nobody is perfect
Like everyone, you gonna keep on your in

There is love I haven't sigh
(to keep you carry on the line)
I'm gonna show that I can
(I'll make you see that I'm alive)
Like a butterfly away it goes me on that I can see,
just say you come with me

Refrão
And I'll fly
I'll sing the way I feel
And I'll fly
I'll show you that i'm real
And I'll fly
I'm sing the way I feel
And I'll fly
I'll show you that I'm real
And I'll fly
I'm trying to change my mind

Came and let me take you on this ride
I've seen your world so let me show you mine
Came and let me take you on this ride
I've seen your world so let me show you mine

(Ja rule)

But there's so many things
(This is the way I've been)
Made me the girl I'm
(You know my history)
You know that I will keep searching for something more

And I'll fly
Came and let me take you on this ride
And I'll fly
I've seen your world so let me show you mine
And I'll fly
Came and let me take you on this ride
And I'll fly
I've seen your world so let me show you mine
