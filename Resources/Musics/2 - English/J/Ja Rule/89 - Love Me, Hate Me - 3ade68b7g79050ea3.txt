LOVE ME, HATE ME

Do you love me, do you hate me (4x) yeah yeah!



This world loves me this world loves me not I'm torn
between the best of both cause I'm hot and this game
so real to me, literally got niggas that wanna riddle
me get rid of me R-U-L-E need I say more world hope
ya'll prepared for the chaos cause ya'll want the
beast in me so I'm a give it paint pictures vivid
live high on spirit here's your hole jump in it
that's what you might as well do if you gonna live
life timid and I never been intimidated believe me and
I don't want to fucking breathe easy I wanna make it
hard for these niggas so when they canâ??t stand me I
make these niggas canâ??t feed their families now do
you love me or do you hate me come on and get me I
keep it off safety



Chorus

Do you love me, do you hate me ready or not here I
come (2x)



Itâ??s nothing but love spread between me and my
niggas shit we bust guns together and fuck so many
bitches and I know that hell is calling in the name of
the Lord just let a nigga in cause I ainâ??t did
nothing wrong love thyself and harm other niggas that
wanna stop my health is that failure cause life will
nail ya hand over hand blood over water man vs. man
it's Murder if I'm gone be hated to be loved I
prefer to live wild and die from slugs what you want
from me Lord Iâ??m only human though I bear your name
I'm a devil in chains release me cause Lord only
knows it ain't easy and when I'm scared for life
and I knows that he sees me now do you love me nigga
or do you hate me nigga come on and get me in waiting
nigga



Chorus



Ya'll just wanna watch me rise then watch me fall
before it's all done I'm a die from it all might
OD in a club of drugs like River Phoenix or get shot
down like Big and Pac for my genius I know this world
seen it before well here I come I know that ya'll
fiending for more and I'm not done as long as I run
concurrent like state time keep up a sane mind and
hand on my iron I'm a blast off mine look in the
eyes of a nigga who seldomly cries gotta beautiful
wife and kids why me got cash, jewels, cars, and cribs
why me? If this is good living Lord why me? When I live
so dirty that you feel I'm worthy to be #1 the
world's only begotten son here I come
