Inseperable you chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll for ever be a part of me 
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we baby (no no)
When you cry who wipes your tears (you)
When you scared who's tellin you there's nothin to fear (you you)

Never hesitate knowin you can call on
Your soulmate and vice versa

See Jacob floss your wrists up
Now ya own me I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED OF BEING LONELY
So baby girl put it on me

[Chorus: Ja Rule (Lil Mo)]:
What would I be without you (What would I be without you)
I only think about you (What you're sayin is true)
I know you're tired of bein lonely (Need someone to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me (I will I will I will)
What would I be without you (What'd I be without you)
I only think about you (What you're sayin is true)
I know you're tired of bein lonely (I need you to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me (Whoa whoa whoa)

[Vita]:
And I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me baby
And the house on the hill when you dropped like 80
On a down payment thinkin damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I've been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in the storm
And I except who you with when you caught in the wrong 
And respect when you flip cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block I watch for 10-4's
And when my pop's was sleep you snuck in the back door
Baby though we'ved been down since junior high
So when life get hot as you lie it's the world against you and I
Be ballin tied together and never
Part from the heart knew that it would last forever
When you told me you would never leave me lonely so baby boy put it on me

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule (Lil Mo)]:
Since we met it's been YOU AND I
A tear for a tear babe and EYE FOR AN EYE
And you know that my heart GON CRY
If you leave me lonely cause you not just my love you my homie (no no no)
Who's gonna console me (my love)
I'm outta control hold me (my love cause I'm yours)
And I don't wanna do nothin to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours baby
A thought alone my break me (break me)
And I don't wanna go crazy (crazy no no no)
Cause every thug needs a lady (yes he does)
Feelin you baby cause them eyes ain't lyin
Wash away all them tears there'll be no more cryin baby (no cryin)
And you complete me and I would die if you ain't with me
So baby girl put it on me (c'mon)

[Chorus]

[Lil' Mo]:
Where would I be if it weren't for you baby
Cause I'm so tired of bein lonely
Where where would I be if it weren' for you you you you
Cause I'm so tired of bein lonely
C'mon 
Don't you know that I love ya I need ya I want ya
Come on and put it on me
