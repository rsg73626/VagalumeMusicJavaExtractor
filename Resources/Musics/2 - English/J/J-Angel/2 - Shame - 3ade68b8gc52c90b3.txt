SHAME

J-Angel ft. Spektaculo - Shame

Spektaculo (rapper)
Yeah
Come here, Boss!
Woo!
J-Angel
Woo
Come here!
Or... are you ashamed?

J-Angel (chorus)
I came here to stay
All on me moves on
The moon already won
Cause the sun was afraid of my own
Shame
What do you mean with "same"
Lame
Around me, everything's the same

Spektaculo (rapper)
You in the isl-island
You're sissy fight-fighters
Go ahead! Past on the pass!
Come on, Go!
Who left Barcena with a lot of afraid?
If you are the king, then I am the blame

J-Angel
I have a feeling
Something gonna be strong
The fear feeds the fear
All moments, that moments, the moments
Don't kill the song!

Chorus
I came here to stay
All on me moves on
The moon already won
Cause the sun was afraid of my own
Shame
What do you mean with "same"
Lame
Around me, everything's the same

Spektaculo (rapper)
Nothing has changed (Nothing)
Nothing has changed (What Mean?)
Nothing Has Changed (Nothing)
What, What, What Mean?

Nothing has changed (Nothing)
Nothing has changed (What Mean?)
Nothing Has Changed (Nothing)
What mean... ?

(Instrumental)

Chorus
I came here to stay
All on me moves on
The moon already won
Cause the sun was afraid of my own
Shame
What do you mean with "same"
Lame
Around me, everything's the same

Spektaculo (rapper)
(Shame
Nothing has changed (Nothing)
Nothing has changed (What Mean?)
Nothing Has Changed (Nothing)
What, What, What Mean?

(Shame
Nothing has changed (Nothing)
Nothing has changed (What Mean?)
Nothing Has Changed (Nothing)
What mean... ?

Woo
What means?
Eh
