HEAR ME

My own love felt for your heart
And I knew is clearly for me
That you can see my fears
Making me suffer

I wanted to care of you
But you never wanted to care of me
You only think in the money rise
So easy to understand

Hear the song playing my heart
I composed this for you
Why do you never tried to read my lips?
And do you hear me?
Listen the rhythm in my heart
And I gave a piece of me
For a stranger melody
Do you hear me?

I supposed can be your love
I imagined to live in a magical landscape
But in trutly is painting on my face
I tried to be your confident
Can you be the worst for me?
Telling my secrets, all of me
By the strange to strange

Hear the song playing my heart
I composed this for you
Why do you never tried to read my lips?
And do you hear me?
Listen the rhythm in my heart
And I gave a piece of me
For a stranger melody
Do you hear me?

Hear me
Do you hear me?

Hear me
Do you hear me?

I didn't the world
I only live in the world
And I met you
I don't deserve

I didn't the world
I only live in the world
And I met you
I don't deserve
(I don't deserve)

Hear the song playing my heart (my heart)
I composed this for you (for you)
Why do you never tried to read my lips? (read my lips)
And do you hear me? (do you hear me?)
Listen the rhythm in my heart (in my heart)
And I gave a piece of me (of me)
For a stranger melody (me)
Do you hear me?

Hear me
(Hear me)
Do you hear me?

Hear me
(Hear me)
Do you hear me?

Hey, hey
Hear Me
Hey, feeling hear me
Hey, hey
Hear me
(Not to ear you)
And do you hear me?
(Hey...)
