UNLOVED

Now I can know what you say
I can know two miles away
And I never never knew
What you did, you did, you did, you did for me
And I played the game of hearts
I played
You lost
I won
And no matter what the people say
I'm the one
I'm brave

Chorus
Classic lonely heart
And I know you feel
Musical is art
It's the ear pill
Fantastical bar
When I live the life
Now I pray for stars
Finally I am

Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved
Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved


Meeting in a music bar
Incredible peace of art
Now I want the "end"
I can buy the stars
I told you all of me
I told all my keys
And I know I failed
Now you and I win


Chorus
Classic lonely heart
(Hey)
And I know you feel
Music is the "art"
It's the ear pill
When a live the life
It's a fantastical bar
Now I pray for stars
Finally I am

Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved
Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved


Feel my words (I'm feeling)
Feel my bones (Yeh...)
Feel my words (I'm feeling)
Feel my bones (Yeh...)

Chorus
Classic lonely heart
And I know you feel
Music is the "art"
It's the ear pill
When a live the life
Now I pray for stars
It's a fantastical bar
Finally I am

Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved
Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved


Loved-Loved, we're both unloved
Loved-Loved, we're both unloved
Loved-Loved, we're both unloved
Loved-Loved, we're both un
Loved-Loved, we're both unloved
Loved-Loved, we're both un
Loved-Loved, we're both unloved
Loved-Loved, we're both un

Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved
Unloved, Unloved
Loved-Loved-Loved
Loved-Loved-Loved
