HEYA

Hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey!
Hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey!

I was there when the little kids were doin' their hey-a hey-a hey!
Dancin' around in a circle doin' their snake dance hey-a hey-a hey!
Hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a ....

I had a jacket from the back of a fox
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!
A warrior and a hunter were my only friends
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!
Hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a ....

I want to be a civilized man
But no one is sane enough to show me how I can
Hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a ....

Fishin' along the San Juan River smokin' driftwood
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!
I was there when the little kids were doin' their hey-a hey-a hey!
Hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a ....
