THUMB

steppin? out, i tried to fix it 
pulled a thumb out of that hole 
give me ingredients, i?ll mix it 
how can you move without a goal 

there never really is a good time 
there?s always nothing much to say 
pretty good, not doing that fine 
getting up most every day 

an excuse is all you?re in for 
the abuse is all you crave 
sure you know just what is in store 
wait and see if i?ll behave 

there never really is a good time 
there?s always nothing much to say 
pretty good, not doing that fine 
getting up most every day 

there?s a time, just let me know now 
when it?s with you i?ll be glad 
that i was right there just to show you 
at least it?s more than what you had 

there never really is a good time
