SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES

I kiss the freedom that you made
Still in shock and so it fades
Can't let go, so it just stays
Dreamin' long out in a way
Far away from where I sit
Gotta one-up in a bit
Tried escaping with the breeze
She seels it all to friends in need

You know where to be found
Can't quite get to the sound
The talk is not the town

Not sure where to get to
Is it in the cards?
Finding you is easy
Finding me is hard
Ffinding you is easy
I'll just try to stall
I don't peak too early
I don't peak at all

Pieces of the last time
Peace is reaching long
I don't get the subjects
Wasn't raised that strong
Fire kept it going
Fire me instead
I'll see you at the movies
The movies in my head

I kiss the freedom that you made
Still in shock or so you say
Can't let go, so it just stays
