ON THE RUN

It's so hard here living on the run
Can't remember where I begun
Just need anchor as solid as a stone
Please don't remind me I'll be gettin' home

Oh, it's so hard 
Just hangin' on 

It's so hard here livin' on the run
Just need to find us the blazing sun
For it's tomorrow's day upon the rise
Please don't remind me I'll be gettin' on

Oh, it's so hard
Just hangin' on

It's so hard here living on the run
Thought I was all the only one
So many others been standin' in the way
Please don't remind me, I'll be bleedin' all

Oh, it's so hard
Oh, it's so hard
Just hangin' on
