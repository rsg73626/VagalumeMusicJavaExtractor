GET ME

i don't see you 
i won't call you 
i don't know enough to stall you 
is it me 
or is it all you 
guess it's on and on 

on a day maybe i'd show you 
but it's the least of all i go through 
but the thing is i don't know you 
and it's on and on 

trembling words don't make my eyes close 
and if anyone then you'd know 
i can't find out 'cause you won't show 
and it's on and on 

every dream is shot by daylight 
and i pray maybe that you're right 
but if you don't, maybe i might 
'cause it's on and on 

you're not gonna get me through this, are you 
you're not gonna get me through this, are you 

anytime i'm there to show you 
if it takes too long i know 
you're out the door just leavin' me screwed 
and it's on and on 

every dream is shot by daylight 
and i pray maybe that you're right 
but if you don't, maybe i might 
'cause it's on and on 

you're not gonna get me through this, are you 
you're not gonna get me through this, are you
