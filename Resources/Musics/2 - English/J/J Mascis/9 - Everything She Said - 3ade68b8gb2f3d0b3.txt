EVERYTHING SHE SAID

Let's take everything
Everything she said
Take it anywhere
Anywhere I'm led
I've been trying hard to see
Eyes get wide, I take off instead

And I piled it up
Threw on everything she said
And I ran around
Clutching it instead
I still tried to feel it out
Still ran around and tried to keep it fed

Hey, I wanted to build the same mistake
And I wanted the thrill
The same mistake for you

Feel the only way
It'll ever feel
Explain it all away
Still won't make it real
I discovered long ago
You'll run around and see if you can deal

Hey, I wanted to build the same mistake
And I wanted the thrill
Can't keep awake

They all want me to be the same mistake
I decided to take another take, not you
