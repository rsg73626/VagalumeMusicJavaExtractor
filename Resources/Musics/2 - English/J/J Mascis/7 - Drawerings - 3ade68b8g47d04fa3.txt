DRAWERINGS

Do you know that it's alright 
I been thinkin', seein' that's not how it's gotta be 
Ain't sayin' if it's worth the fight 
I'm a space but you can count on me to save your place 

And I know it's all to do with you and me 
Do you know if you're against the deal
We'll wait and see 
But I'd love to hear that story once again 
It's the only part of me you still defend 

Did you know I heard your voice
When I call to see if you're around, I have no choice 
Then the news is in my face 
Took a step to let the feeling go and lost my place 

And I swear I hear the same things every night 
Once again no accounted for the hours I spent 
Baked as any time I drifted out of sight 
And the way it told me that's just out of sight

Anywhere you'd like to go 
Would it help to be inside the life I couldn't know
Ff you shake it, it won't show 
Hold out for me, 'cause bailin' at this point is really low, Woh!

Walkin' for the kids

And I know it's all to do with just a friend 
Remember when we didn't need this time to spend
But I'd love to hear that story once again 
It's the only part of me you still defend
