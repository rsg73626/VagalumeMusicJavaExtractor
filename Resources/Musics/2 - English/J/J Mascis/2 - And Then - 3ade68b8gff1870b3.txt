AND THEN

I gave more than I believe
Travel on its failing me
Trailing me trailing me
To the sea to the sea
And then
To the outer reach
Feel the way I never felt

Explain again
Just to know you
And then
Release another piece of how you ever went
I'm below you
And then. And then. And then
My friend

Drifting cuz the peace was never lonely
We're about to place
Picture and enlist her
In the grip of yet another place
Another waste
Nothing's real or ever was
Down to you is ground to dust
Who to trust who to trust
All the dust
And then
To the outer reach
Wrapped inside the biggest time or overrun

Just to know you
And then
Explain to me another way to get it done
Who will I go to?
This friend. This friend. This friend
And then
Drifting cuz the peace was never lonely
We're about to place

Picture and enlist her in the grip of yet another place
Another waste
And then
And then
And then
And then
