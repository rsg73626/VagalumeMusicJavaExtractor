WIDE AWAKE

I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Come on over baby
Time to figure out
Dreaming of the reason
What will bring you around

I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Waiting for an answer, waiting for the time
Thinking of a way I'm
Not sure where to act
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake

Come on over baby
Glancing me a chill
Walking in your footsteps
Walking by you I will
Twisted in the ancient
Torn apart with lie
Scoured all the pages
Not enough to find

Here I'm at
Sneaking past
Came out stand
Turn me on
Turn me on
Wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
