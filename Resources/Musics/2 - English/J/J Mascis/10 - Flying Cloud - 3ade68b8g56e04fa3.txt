FLYING CLOUD

Things happen 
And no one told me 
You can't think 
I won't drink it 
You laughed again 
Then you rode me 
I won't drop it 
You can't stop it now 

Hey lady 
Where you goin' 
Hey lady 
Why ain't it snowing 
Were you riding the chair alone 
Hey lady 
Where's your friend 
Hey lady 
Blew you off again 
Don't worry 
I'll ride you up to the top 
Hey lady 
Sorry, that's the last stop 

I'll see you 
I'll see you 
All the way down 
I'll see you 
In the large flying cloud 
I'll see you 
I'll see you 
All the way down 
I'll see you 
In the large flying cloud
