BLOWIN' IT

I been thinking through the night 
Everybodys so uptight 
People hurt and thats their right 
Cut em all loose, think I might 
Stewin, hangin out in town 
And my head whirlin around 
Don't trust your mind, it'll let you down 
Don't have a thing to go on 

I dont know a thing to say to you 
I dont know a thing to say to you 

There's a time and there's a place 
It's not now, it's time to pace 
Things I'd say but just can't face 
All it means to say them
Would believe the things I feel 
Then tomorrow get the same deal 
Am I acting on something real 
Or am I blowing it again 

I dont know a thing to say to you
I dont know a thing to say to you
I dont know a thing to say to you
I dont know a thing to say to you
