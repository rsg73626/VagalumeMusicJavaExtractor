SAME DAY

I woke up 
suddenly you're the one I love 
it's the sameday 
it's the sameday 
I got pissed 
but it's god who gave me this 
on the sameday 
it's the sameday 

better be grateful son 
it's you who wanted my life 
here's what you asked for 
do your best don't mess with my life 

dreamed a picture sent to me 
couldn't hold it that was my life 
it's sad 
it's sad to know your colder 
piece together you and me 
the gift means everything to my life 
be glad 
be glad that no one told you 
rain on, rain on 
rain on now that was my life 
rain on, rain on 
bring them where they ought to be 
make a pile and call it my life 

lock the door and hit the floor groan that was my life 
now look at everything it's beautiful that's my life 

all a dream 
you can tell me what I mean 
it's the sameday 
it's the sameday 
judgements off 
gotta go with my first though 
on the sameday 
it's the sameday 

dreamed a picture sent to me 
couldn't hold it that was my life 
it's sad 
it's sad to know your colder 
piece together you and me 
the gift means everything to my life 
be glad 
be glad that no one told you 
rain on, rain on 
rain on now that was my life 
rain on, rain on 
bring them where they ought to be 
make a pile and call it my life 
it's sad 
it's sad to know your colder 
rain on, rain on 
rain on now that was my life 
rain on, rain on 
rain on, rain on 
rain on now that was my life 
rain on, rain on
