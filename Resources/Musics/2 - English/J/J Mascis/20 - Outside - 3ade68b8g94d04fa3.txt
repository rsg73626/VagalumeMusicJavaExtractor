OUTSIDE

I've been away too long
I've been a freak
On the other side
Everything turned out wrong
Wait 'till we meet
I won't know where to hide
Fenced inside it's over, done
Just to be there, said i'd won
And I'm not the only one
Who'll run, who'll run
Outside (6x)
I tend to think too much
I've been insane
I'll take another ride
I've been a little shy
I've been too vain
On the other side

Everybody took my turn
I don't know why I can't learn
No surrender I won't learn
I'll squirm, I'll squirm
Outside (6x)

Where 'ya goin' baby?
I think we've been in this way too long
On the other side
(Guitar solo)

I've been away too long
I've been a waste
On the other side
Everything turned out wrong
I've got no taste
On the other side
I've been away too long
I've been away too long
On the other side
