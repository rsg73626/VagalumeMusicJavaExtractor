SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW

I'd like to see you 
In the morning 
In the evening 
But you need a warning 
I'd like to see you 
It's a last ditch 
C'mon you gotta 
Ain't sayin' there's not a hitch 

Come on out now 
It's the only way 
Can't think I know how 
Is that all you're gonna let me say 

I'd like to see you 
Don't you miss it 
Lied again today 
And now I wish that 
You'd believe me 
When I need to 
You should be weary 
I would if I were you 

Can I come along 
I can't take the strain 
Now what else is wrong 
Sure, i'll take the blame 

I'd like to see you

When I need to 
You should be weary 
I would if I were you 

Can I come along

Now what else is wrong 
Sure, I'll take the blame 
Come on out now 
It's the only way 
Can't think I know how 
Is that all you're gonna let me say 

You got things to do 
So what else is new 
Won't you give me some 
Bring it back for me 
Won't you come and see 
You're the only one 
You're the only one 
You're the only one
