IS IT DONE

I got more I got no need
I got nothing I could leave
I got things that you should see

I went riding all around
Hit the pass
I built this sound
Try'd to picture it going dow wow n

Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done

Felt a pull I pulled away
We got nothing that ill say
Still I feel its not this way

Waiting nothings goin round
Can't seem to get it of the ground
Seeing if ill come around

Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done

Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh

I know my soul is battered
And I know my mind is gone
I been waiting for an answer
But the question takes to long
I need guidance on the river
I need everything ive done
So familiars coming at me
Don't want to blow it all at once

Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
