BACK BEFORE YOU GO

gotta tip off there's a sabatoer at bay 
brutal message hits i gotta wanna play 
i need god beside me love to light my way 
give me the guts to choose the strength to stay 

i know it 
i know it well 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

gotta let 
let this one go 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

back to a place that's doin' nobody no good 
there's a strength there if i really understood 
i need god beside me piled deep in sludge 
a deadness so relentless will not budge 

i know it 
i know it well 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

gotta let 
let this one go 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

i know it 
i know it well 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

gotta let 
let this one go 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

i know it 
i know it well 
it could be back before you know 
back before you go 

i know it 
i know it 
i know it 
i know it
