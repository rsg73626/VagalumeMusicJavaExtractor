EVERY MORNING

Set up in the morning running in the afternoon
Stayed out past the morning someone peeled it off too soon
Every morning makes it hard on me every morning makes it hard on me
Then I wake to who I'll never be then it hits me it's the life I lead
Set up in the morning said I gave away too soon
Wish I had a morning didn't know what else to do

Every morning makes it hard on me piece
Together what could never be
In the wait I heard you'll never see
Give it up I can always be
Oh baby won't you see me
Oh baby won't you see me
See me

Every morning makes it hard on me
Every morning makes it hard on me
Then I wake to who I'll never be and
It hits me it's the life I lead
Oh baby won't you see me
Oh baby won't you see me
See me

Ain't nobody know it ain't nobody know it
Ain't nobody know it ain't nobody know it
Every morning makes it hard on me
Every morning makes it hard on me
Then I wake to who I'll never be and
It hits me it's the life I lead
