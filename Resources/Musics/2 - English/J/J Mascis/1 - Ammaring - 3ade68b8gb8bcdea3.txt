AMMARING

There's some scenery I'm missing 
There's a piece I can't undo 
Remember when I really blew it 
Wish I would've thought of you 

Tell the Ammaring 
Tell a friend 
Tell the only one around who's going to know 
Just what to send 
It's the Amma Ring 
It's a smile 
Saying time to come with me son 
You'll be gone for quite a while 
Come on now 

Drifting's made a big impression 
Changed the focus changed the goal 
It's less and less about our reasons 
It's mmore about losing control 

Get the Ammaring 
Get a friend 
Get the only one around whose going to know 
Just what to send 
It's the Amma Ring 
It's a smile 
Saying time to come with me son 
You'll be gone for quite a while 
Come on now 

There's the Ammaring 
There you are 
I don't know too much about it 
But I know that your a star 
Come on now
