GOIN' HOME

In the places that you said you'd meet me 
I don't see you hanging around 
If that's all you ever tell me 
Seems you don't wanna be found 
I'm goin' home 

Don't come over 
I can't get lower 
No more meetin' 
I been beaten 

Got a blast of what I should be 
Busy doing, yes, I'm lost 
I want to tell you that I miss you 
But I'm pissed you blew me off 
I'm goin' home 

No more meetin' 
I been beaten 
I can't take it 
Go and shake it 

I breath all alone for you
I need and you know it's true 

By the pound the tension's mountin' 
Wrapped around me feelin' tight 
If you're castin' out some psycho 
You'll need me, tantrum I won't bite 
On a day that's burnin' this crazed 
Don't tempt me 'cause I might 
But if it's gonna be the last time 
Well then maybe it's alright 
I'm goin' home 

It's inside 
May go ahead fight it 
I've about had it 
Go ahead grab it 
I can't take it 
Go ahead fake it 

I breath all alone for you 
I need and you know it's true 
I breath all alone for you 
I need nothin', I can do 

People tell me that you miss me 
And I guess I'm doin' fine
