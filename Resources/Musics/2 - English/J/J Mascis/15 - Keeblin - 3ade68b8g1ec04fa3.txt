Come on over
I just wanna be the same friend
Need it slower
I just wanna get it smooth then
Wonderin' why you need these things you show
I don't like to see it
Grabbin' at you from those years ago
Do you have to be it

Come on over
I just wanna be the same friend
Need it slower
I just wanna get it smooth then
Wonderin' why you need these things you show
I don't like to see it
Grabbin' at you from those years ago

I don't wanna turn it out like that
I don't like to see it
All right, just tell me if that's where your at
