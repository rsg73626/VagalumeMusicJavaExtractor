NOT YOU AGAIN

I thought of the blob today
I thought of you
I thought of the mess i made again
How do I do it

Now when it leaves your hand
Just understand
I'm the one it missed
Right through a piece
I've been keepin' away
You really can't resist

I thought of the blob today
I thought of you
I thought of the mess I made again
How do I do it

I got no advice about anything
Just fuck it up yourself
Is she the kind of girl
That's worth getting
In such a sticky mess

If I say a word just stop me
Cause I relly should shut up
Guess I'll split now
Just forget you met me
Forget I brought it up

I thought of the blob today
I thought of you
I thought of the mess I made again
How do I do it

Hey girl, now walk me home
Just, drive me home
Pick me up again
Waiting for things to change
I'll rearrange stuff
No, not you again
If I say a word just stop me
Cause I really should shut up
Guess I'll split now
Just forget you met me
Sorry I fucked it all up again
