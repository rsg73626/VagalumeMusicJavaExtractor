GET IT ON THE LOW (FEAT. JIM JONES)

(Jim Jones intro)
We ain't gone talk about it
Sound like a lot of **** on the way to the airport
I gotta do a pick up
Two percocets let's get it
Hold that for me

(Chorus) x2
I get it on the low
I'm steady chasin' dough
I'm never goin' broke
My pockets swollen
I never stunt a ***
I'm ready from the go
This all a ***** know
***** I be flown'

(Jim Jones verse)
And I be flowin' out in Tokyo
Have your block snowing like the Pocanos
Pretty little ***** in some open toes
Said that's a pretty big whip in an open road
I'm getting splashy out in Big Willie
Them **** give me action I'm a big willy
From uptown to summertime where them kids wheely
They bust around you come around with the big milly
My pockets swole I need Benadryl
On ***** you know that blew 20 mill
Got a few houses and a Bentley still
True jeans, Air max's, Fendi belt is ill

(Chorus) x2
I get it on the low
I'm steady chasin' dough
I'm never goin' broke
My pockets swollen
I never stunt a ***
I'm ready from the go
This all a ***** know
***** I be flown'

(J-Lie verse)
The champion Diddy's son bad boy since birth
Mo ***** slow bucks printed on my shirt
No flowers but a ***** sipping' Rose
Rose gold Derrick Rose coast to coast A
A, the city tatted on my chest
No Vinny but my entourage
On turtles neck
Choke hold on top never sittin' middle
Two hands on that ***** no double dribble
Smokin' that lala call me Melo
Half Asian blood now that's black & yellow
Your ***** on it, she an avalanche
She a cold ****, she wanna jack it man

(Chorus) x2
I get it on the low
I'm steady chasin' dough
I'm never goin' broke
My pockets swollen
I never stunt a ***
I'm ready from the go
This all a ***** know
***** I be flown'

(J-Lie outro)
And it's on like that
Jim Jones
J-Lie
Bird Gang
Oh, and me, I'm just an unsigned *****
