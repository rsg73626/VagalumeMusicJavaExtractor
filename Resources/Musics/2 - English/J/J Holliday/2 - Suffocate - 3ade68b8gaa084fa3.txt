SUFFOCATE

Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinking about you all day long and 
I can't wait for shorty to come through 
From your lips and neck 
To your eyes, my hands on your hips homie grind
I'm fantasying about what I'm gonna do to you. 
You got me fiending for her love (can't lie) 
Man you should see how she got me 
Spending all this time with her (with her) 
I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fool 
Tell me what a man is to do. 
 
Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me, 
I Can't breathe when you're touching me 
I Suffocate when you're away from me 
So much love you take from me 
I'm going out of my mind 

I can't breathe when you talk to me, 
I can't breathe when you're touching me 
I suffocate when you're away from me 
So much love you take from me 
I'm going out of my mind
Whenever we up in this bed and my finger fall in your hair, 
I wonder if you feel me watching you 
Cause I can't go a night without your loving 
Got me looking at this phone 

Everytime it rings I hope it's you (girl) 
Got me bracing through your love (and I)
I've fallen for you
I (can't lie) I just wanna be with you 
And yes, she got me there I said it
Somebody call the paramedics tell them to hurry up and come through

Cause I can't breathe (can't breathe) when you talk to me 
I can't breathe when you're touching me (when your touching me) 
I suffocate when you're away from me 
So much love you take from me 
I'm going out of my mind (I'm going out of my mind)

I can't breathe when you talk to me 
I can't breathe when you're touching me 
I suffocate when you're away from me 
So much love you take from me 
I'm going out of my mind 

Don't never leave me girl
I need you inside my world
I can't go a day without you
And see nobody else would love but you
I'll never feel like I feel with you
Because I 
 
I can't breathe when you talk to me 
I can't breathe when you're touching me 
I suffocate when you're away from me 
So much love you take from me 
I'm going out of my mind ( I'm going out of my mind) 
I can't breathe when you talk to me 
I can't breathe when you're touching me ( I can't breathe) 
I Suffocate when you're away from me so much love you take from me. 
I'm going out of my mind (I'm going out of my mind).
Ouhh no no I can't breathe
Ouhh no no I can't breathe
Ouhh no no I cant breathe
Ouuhhhhhh woo ouhh 
Ouhh no no I can't breathe
Ouhh no no I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
