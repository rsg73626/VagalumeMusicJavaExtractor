SOMETHING MORE

435
I am drunk again
Been a long time
Since I saw you
Certainly
I am out of church
Now I don't mind
Forgive me more
I'm ready for something more

250 all alone
On the backroom
Trying find my way
I can't look at
The back before
The sun goes but
I'm ready for something more
Reaction

Woke up not
As before on the backroom
Waiting for something more casual
Sitting on a no
Good it won't
Tell if I do

Ready for something I
That Some day will find
A thoudsand stars
A thousand lights
I toke my time
I toke it all
Started to
Reverse with draw

250 all alone
On the backroom
Trying find my way
I can't look at
The back before
The sun goes but
I'm ready for something more
Reaction
