IN YOUR MIND

Tell me to move on, it don't serve you right
You tell me to work hard, I been up for a few nights
I been doin' this for a new life
Keep my eyes shut for a new sight
If they love puttin' you down
go ahead say fuck that too lighter
Worried about what's ahead
worried about never getting the bread
Worry is constantly stuck in my head

So worried it's hard to sleep in my bed
I read all of the comments you said
Got me forgetting the things that I dread
Shinning a hope that I'll finally make it
Taking a jump, when I fall you might break it
I faked and pretended I'm somebody else
Traded my passion for some of the world
Hated the fact I was losing myself

This pen and this paper the way that I'm done
I boarded the options when nothing is changing
Need so much more than just somebody famous
Give 'em a reason for stand and ovations
I'm patient, I'm loving the journey I'm taking
All of my friends who think that I've ditched
I never have time I could spend
The fake ones keep slowly just breaking away
The real ones straight up when I bend
Couple up wondering how life has been
Others it feels like it slowly depends
What am I doing, what am I making?
No other reason they ever hit send

Always getting home late and I feel like I never have time
(Like I never have time, no time)
But they tell me don't stress, cuz that shit yeah
it's all in your mind
(It's all in your mind, your mind)
And this feeling so crazy
how fast all these months go by
(All these months go by, go by, go by)
But they tell me don't stress, cuz that shit yeah
it's all in your mind
(It's all in your mind, your mind)
