REALMS OF GLORY

Angels, from the realms of glory
wing your flight o'er all the earth
ye who sang creation's story
now proclaim messiah's birth
come and worship, come and worship
worship christ, the newborn king

shepherds, in the fields abiding
watching o'er your flocks by night
god with man is now residing
yonder shines the infant light
come and worship, come and worship
worship christ, the newborn king

sages, leave your contemplations
brighter visions beam afar
seek the great desire of nations
ye have seen his natal star
come and worship, come and worship
worship christ, the newborn king
sinners, wrung with true repentance
doomed for guilt to endless pains
justice now revokes the sentence
mercy calls you-break your chains

come and worship, come and worship
worship christ, the newborn king
though an infant now we view him
he shall fill his father's throne
gather all the nations to him
every knee shall then bow down
come and worship, come and worship
worship christ, the newborn king

all creation, join in praising
god the father, spirit, son
evermore your voices raising
to th'eternal three in one
come and worship, come and worship
worship christ, the newborn king
