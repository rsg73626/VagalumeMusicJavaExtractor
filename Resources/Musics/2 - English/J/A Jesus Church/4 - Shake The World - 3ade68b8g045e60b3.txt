SHAKE THE WORLD

In christ the lost are found
whats dead has come to life
in christ the sinner is a saint
made holy in your sight
in christ the blind can see
what's broken is now restored
in christ the weak are strong
lifted by your grace alone

by your mercy you gave up your glory
now I'm forever changed, by the sacrifice you made
I'll forever praise the God who saves
the God who saves
in christ I am free to your kingdom of love and peace
in christ I am built [?] with your spirit inside of me
inside of me

by your mercy, you gave up your glory
now I'm forever changed by the sacrifice you make
I'll forever praise the God who saves
the God who saves
come shake the world we wanna see Jesus
come shake the world we wanna see Jesus
come shake the world, we wanna see Jesus
come shake the world, we wanna see Jesus!

now I'm forever changed, by the sacrifice you make
I'll forever praise, the God who saves
the God who saves
