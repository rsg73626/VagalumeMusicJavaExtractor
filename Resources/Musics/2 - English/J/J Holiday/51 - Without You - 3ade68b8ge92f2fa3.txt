WITHOUT YOU

It's crazy how I'm seein u
cuz i just told your lil cousin the other day
i need to speak to you
girl how u doin, how u been
lets get all of that all the way
i got so much to say
I heard u had a baby on me
is that the truth
or is the block just hatin on me
and i aint trippin if you got ur self a man
girl cuz i can change that given half a chance

feelin me apoligize
everything i did that made u cry
i know u dont wanna hear this song
but i promise i wont take to long
i needed you to hear the rest
at least i got it off my chest
don't walk away
cuz if u do you'll miss the best part
of what i gotta say

Baby I want, to go back in time
to the first time, get it right
I'm sorry
And my life is nothing without you, baby
My life is nothing without you
my life is nothing without you

i know that it was hard for you
and i know that you were hungry for love
girl and i was starving you
and it was childish I admitt


how I tried to get you back for everything you did 
girl i would have never packed up and bounced
if you ain't feel the need to go sneakin around
and im sure you wouldn't have checked my messages
if I would have been honest bout where I been

first let me apologize for 
anything i did that made u cry
i know u dont wanna hear this song
but i promise i wont take to long
i needed you to hear the rest
at least i got it off my chest
don't walk away
cuz if u do you'll miss the best part
of what i gotta say

Baby I want, to go back in time
the to first time, get it right
I'm sorry
And my life is nothing without you, baby
My life is nothing without you
my life is nothing without you

Baby I want, to go back in time
to the first time, get it right
to the first time, and get it right
Baby I want, to go back in time
to the first time, get it right
Cuz I'm Sorry
And my life is nothing without you
nothing without you baby
nothing without you baby
nothing without you baby
