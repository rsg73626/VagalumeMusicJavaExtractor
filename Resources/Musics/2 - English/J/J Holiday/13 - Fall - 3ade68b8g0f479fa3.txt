FALL

It wasn't supposed to go this way... 

Every day I get up, shes on my mind 
I can't get enough & I don't know why 
But it's more than a crush 
I can't believe it's getting deeper 
All the time I wanna see her 

[Chorus]

But it wasn't suppose to go this way 
She was suppose to be another game to play 
And I can't figure it out 
I don't know how she did it 
But she made me fall, fall, fall 

How do you find yourself 
Inside of love (Inside of love) 
With a girl that you met 
Inside the club (Inside the club) 
Never could that be me, yeah
That was what I used to say 
Until it happened just the same to me 
I never thought it could happen to me 
But these days I'm finding myself on the ground 
And I just don't know how I got here 
All I know is that I'm down & out 

But it wasn't suppose to go this way (Go this way) 
She was suppose to be another game to play (Game to play) 
And I can't figure it out 
I don't know how she did it 
But she made me fall, fall, fall 

[Breakdown]

Have you ever met someone 
That you thought was for the moment 
Then they came & stole your heart 
Before you knew that it was stolen 
Took you by surprise 
Cause you never saw it coming 
And now I can't deny 
That baby girl you got me fallin (Whoo!)

But it wasn't suppose to go this way (Go this way) 
She was suppose to be another game to play (Game to play) 
And I cant figure it out 
I don't know how she did it 
But she made me fall, fall, fall 

But it wasn't suppose to go this way (Go this way) 
She was suppose to be another game to play (Game to play) 
And I can't figure it out 
I don't know how she did it (She did it, did it)
But she made me fall, fall, fall 

How did I find myself inside of love ?(Love)
