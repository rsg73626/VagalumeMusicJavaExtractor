RUN INTO MY ARMS

Baby girl
Drop your guard, I won't
Hurt you, No Baby I
Wanna give you everything you need
Yeah, Yeah

I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your knight in shining armor
But baby you gotta let me... Oh Yeah
Just like in the movies baby

I`ma come to the rescue
I`ma come rescue you
And I know this might sound crazy
But I think I'm here to protect you

So girl can you stop running
This ain't that kind of loving
He got you just running to my arms
And I will show you girl

Baby you can run into my arms
And baby you know that I will do no harm
Because I can be your everything, Your Superman
Whatever you need, I can be
Just run into my arms
Baby girl

But I promise that you'll be my queen
