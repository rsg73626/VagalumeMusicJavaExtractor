HOME WRECKER

She is a Home Wrecker
But it's my fault I let her
She's a ho-ho-hohoho-home wrecker

I fucked up knew she wasn't bout nothin'
But she was cool as shit quick to give it up and
Who would've known that it would last this long?

My whole intention was to hit and keep it moving
But she was a pro, yeah the girl knew what she was doin'
I had it made, a wifey at home and a side chick to play with

Something changed and now she actin' crazy
Blowin' up my phone knowing I'm here with my baby
Said If I don't come over then she gonna tell my lady
Man this bitch shady said she pregnant with my baby

She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let her

She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let her
She's a ho-ho-hohoho-home wrecker

Long rides out of town on the weekend
She was cool with hookin' up every other weekend
She said she 'ppreciate the honesty
And that's the reason that she fucks with me

When my girl calls she would be quit
Rubbin' on my arm listenin' to me lyin'
She said a man goin be a man you see
Long as you keep it between us three

Something changed and now she actin' crazy
Blowin' up my phone knowing I'm here with my baby
Said If I don't come over then she gonna tell my lady
Man this bitch shady said she pregnant with my baby

She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let her

She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let her
She's a ho-ho-hohoho-home wrecker

See it's cool when it's cool but it all goes bad
When a girl catches feelings
And all that cool shit you had is a thing of the past
Throw it all out the window

And I know bout whats wrong ain't no piece of ass worth losing your woman
And I hope I learned my lesson almost lost what I had, Oh, fucking with this

She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let her

She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let her
She's a ho-ho-hohoho-home wrecker
