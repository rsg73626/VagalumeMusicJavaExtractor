Yo !

I can't even believe I'm 'bout to tell you this but 
It's like ever since I been with you 
Things you know been changed 
Parts of me been dyin' and, 
I just wanna tell you 'bout it 


Lately I feel like I been sleepping 
and it's you that got me trippin' 
Because I can't control myself when I'm around you, oh

With anyother I would've been done 
Loved her, left her, next one 
But I just can't shake you off 

Cause you got it all girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
The body of a call girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
With a mind of a teacher (yeah, yeah) 
That's why I need you (yeah, yeah) 
I gotta let you know (yeah, yeah) 

Girl, the pimp in me just died (died), died (died),

When I looked into your eyes (eyes), your eyes (eyes),
your eyes 
You don't know how hard I've tried 
Not to show you, not to chill with you, not to mess
with you no more (tried) 
Girl the pimp in me just died (died), it died (it died),

It ain't no use in me to fake it 
Here goes my heart girl take it 
Do what you wanna do 
But please don't play me out 
Just understand what you have got here 
I'm the realist you go on find here 
I know you hear this all the time 
I put my heart and soul on mine

Cause you got it all girl 
The body of a call girl (ohh)
