BETCHA NEVER HAD

Body like a mutha f**ka,damn baby u
Ridin like a vet trucker,hold up what u say 
I'll be pleasin you u'll be pleasin me
Promise me u'll stay here and never leave me 
But hold up let me say somethin,pretty mamma thang 
Why am i gonna tell you somethin,that i dont mean
Cuz we in the heat of the moment,ima give u the biz b4 i came to the house i told u 
Dont be catchin fellins 

[Hook:]
I cann tell you never had
A nigga this young put it on ya 
Askin why i wint stay the night,and hold ya 
I can tell you never had 
A young nigga take the cat,from ya 
Then say i say i cant staygot 
Something eles to tend to
I can tell you aint never had it had it had it 

Now why you gotta make this 

A situation 
You met the kid and decided 
That u wanted to dig in 
When i said u agreed that it 
Wouldnt be no static 
Yes i promise to heat it up 
Take it down south girl and eat it up
Inever agreed to have chains on me 
When it came to leave 

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Damn i cant lie,i know 
U got skill babe,u want us to be close 
But im not ready to let go
Of bein free to lay my head 
Where i fell like 
Girl,i told you once b4 so just 
Can you understand
