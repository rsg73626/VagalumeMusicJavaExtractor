I TRIED

You know I tried, you know I tried, yeah
You know I tried, you know I tried, yeah, yeah
You know I tried, yeah you know I rally tried baby
So listen, I tried

Oh girl what I don't understand is
why you wanna trip so hard?
'Cause you know I got a good full time job
And when on the road making doe
You can get anything you want from me

But what you don't understand is
That you said you'd hold me down
But now you're running around town talking 'bout I ain't shit
But baby girl I did my best

Girl I tried to give you all my time but it wasn't enough for you
You wanted more than I could give
I really tried but now you're switching sides
Can you tell me why baby? Tell me why?

Now baby I, I really love you, you, you, you, you, you
And everything I did it was all for who? You
Said you wanted you a real love
What I did wasn't enough, not enough of you, no

Said you wanted you a real love
What I did wasn't enough, not enough of you
But I know I can say that I tried

Girl I tried to give you all my time but it wasn't enough for you
You wanted more than I could give
I really tried and now you're switching sides
Can you tell me why? Tell me why?
Play

You know I tried, you know I tried
You know I tried, I know I did everything I could
And baby I really wish you wouldn't leave me alone

Girl I tried to give you all my time but it wasn't enough for you
You wanted more than I could give
I really tried but now you're switching sides
Can you tell me why? Tell me why?

You know I tried, you know I tried
You know I tried
