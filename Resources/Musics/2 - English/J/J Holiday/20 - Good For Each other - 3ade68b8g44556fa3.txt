GOOD FOR EACH OTHER

We Are Good For Each Other 
We Were Meant To Be Together 

Girl We Met Such A Long Time Ago 
But I Was Too Young And Scared To Let U Know 
But Im Standin Right Here Right Now 
Tellin You I Love You And I Aint Gonna Back Down 
In Your Life, It Has Changed But I Know 
It Was A Mistake To Let You Go 
The Situation Aint The Same From The Phone 
Girl Cant Be Nothin Better 
Than You And Me Forever 
Like Woodgrain And Leather 
We Fit Good Together

Girl The Old Sayin Is, 
"What You Love Let It Go, 
If It Comes Back Then It Was Yours, 
And If It Dont Then It Wont." 
So Thats What I Did And 
Girl You Came Back So 
Now You're Mine That Feelin Thats Fine 
Just Get Ready For My Love 
Get Ready For My Touch

Oh Baby Come And Be My Lady 
And We Can Be Bonnie And Clide All Up In My Mercedes

Like The Sun And The Moon And Flowers In June 
We Were Meant To Be Together 
Just Like Paper And Glue, Bebe King And The Blues 
We Were Meant To Be Together 
Like Hennesy And Mary Jane, Teddy P. And Marvin Gaye 
But Its Always Been This Way 
Its Gone Always Stay The Same 
We Gone Be Forever Like Winter Coat And Sweater Oh Girl
