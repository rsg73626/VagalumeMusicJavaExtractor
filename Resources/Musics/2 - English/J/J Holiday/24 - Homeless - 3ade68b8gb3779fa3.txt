HOMELESS

See there's this lady that lives on the street (on the street, yeah)
She has no job, no home, no family (family)
And she barely has the chance to even eat (Oh, oh, oh)
So she begs and steals and sells her body (her body)

Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But if it was you (if it was you)
What would you do? (what would you do?)
If you didn't have a home (oh, yeah)

[Chorus]

If you didn't have a pot to piss in,
Didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you (imagine if it was you)
Just imagine if it was you
'Cause one day, yes you could be homeless

There's a man, on the street
He got holes in his shoes, on his feet
We be in the club spending doe
Then we'd come outside and tell him no
All he need is a couple bucks
He's got a little change but it's not enough
So we turn our backs and laugh
Or we stop in our tracks
And turn the other way, 'cause we got it made

Sometimes he make 'em off (sometimes he make 'em off)
Just a little strong (just a little strong)
But he's on his own
But what about you (but what about you)
What would you do? (what would you do?)
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in
Didn't have a kitchen (Hey!)
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends (Oh!)
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life (look at your life)
And imagine if it was you (imagine if it was you)
Just imagine if it was you
'Cause one day, yes you could be homeless

[Breakdown]

A new day when I open my eyes
Got a black president but there's people outside
I know you've seen 'em and we all done passed 'em
Some people seen some shit last night
Still got 'em laughin'
But it's not funny, it's all about money
And I bet you won't go put on them shoes
It's crazy because we're out clubbin', ain't worried 'bout nothing
But imagine if that person was you, imagine if it was you...
