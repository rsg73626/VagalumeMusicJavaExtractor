FATAL

Everyday You`re Gone
It`s Killin Me To Be Without You
Can`t Make It Alone

Everyday You`re Gone
It`s Killin Me To Be Without You
Can`t Make It Alone 
Girl Cause I`m Missin` You

It`s Like I Got A Hangover
I Can`t Get You Outta My Head
Just Like I Wrecked My New Rover
Girl I Can`t Get You Out Of My Head
And I Ain`t Never Been Low But
It`s Like I`m Broke And I`m Outta The Game
So I Swallow My Pride If That`s The Only Way
To Make It Better Babe

I Know I Been Wrong (Know I Been Wrong) 
And We Been Fightin So Long 
(We Been Fightin So Long)
Come and See About Me (Come And See About Me)
It`s Gettin` Hard To Breathe (Ooohhh)
Baby I`m Sorry

I Miss You
Everyday You`re Gone
It`s Killin Me To Be Without
Without You
I Can`t Make It Alone
Baby Can We Work It Out
I Miss You
It`s Fatal You Know
Girl I`m Guna Die Without
Without You
Tell Me Wat To Do
Girl Cause I`m Missin` You

(Oh Oh) Maybe If I Was Older
Then I Wouldn`t Be Makin` These Mistakes
And I Know Your Girlfriends Told Ya
I Didn`t Listen To A Word I Gotta Say 
But All I Wanna Do Is Hold Ya
You`re Like A Habit That I Just Can`t Shake
And A Life With You Is What I`m Tryna Make
Baby Can`t You See

I Know I Been Wrong (I Know I Been Wrong)
And We Been Fightin` So Long 
(We Been Fightin` Too Long)
Come and See About Me (Come And See About Me)
It`s Gettin Hard To Breathe
Baby I`m Sorry

I Miss You (Hey)
Everyday You`re Gone
It`s Killin Me To Be Without (It`s Killin Me)
Without You (Can`t Ya See)

It`s Fatal You Know (Fatal Ya Kno)
Girl I`m Guna Die Without
Without You
Tell Me Wat To Do (Jus Tell Me Wat To Do)
Girl Cause I`m Missin You (Baby I`m missin` You)
