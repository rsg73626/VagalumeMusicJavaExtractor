WRONG LOVER (FEAT. RICK ROSS)

You Might need a passport for this one

Guess who... Boss!
You know sometimes ladies they move to fast
and they choose the wrong one
Yea!
But if you like me

Like repossession
Belive that

By the way that you scream my name
I put a talk that you aint been claimed
Now you up in here with that lame
Looking back you chose the wrong lover
(thats the wrong dude over there Baby)
And I can tell that you feel the same
You see me your expression change
I dont want To approach or disrespect
So I text you I gotta have you tonight

So lets do it again
Meet me at the spot
So we can Dot dot dot-dot dot dot
Alright (Alright)
She hit me back like 3 O'clock

Its the way that you walk smooth (so sexy)
The way that You move ooh
Girl I cant let You escape I have to reposses u stay
Its the way that you walk smooth
The way that You move ooh
Since that night you was all mines
You realized you chose the wrong lover

By the way that You play your game
Put a talk that your field done changed
But baby now all you can say for yourself is I love ya
And its written all on your face (all over your face)
That you wanna meet me at your place
I dont want To approach or disrespect
So I text baby whats up for tonight (sup baby deal with me)

So lets do it again
Meet me at the spot

Alright (Alright)
She hit me back like 3 O'clock

Not frontin baby I Got more paper than Him to
Not being arrogant or am I?

I shines on a rainy night
My new mercedes bright
I let her hit the smoke
Me knowing this how ladys like it
We counting thousand stacks
Im on my 89th
She on her 21st
Feel like a pretty curse
But then the tables turn
She actin like she aint concerned
Running with a wide reciver cuz hes paper firm
Another angel came
Player got hes ankle sprained
Out for the season
now she see that things are not the same
She made the wrong choice picked the wrong man
But baby I forgive now get with the program
Its ricky ross jholiday You a star
and I got the perfect part to play

Its the way that you walk smooth (so sexy)
The way that You move ooh
Girl I cant let You escape I have to reposses u stay
Its the way that you walk smooth
The way that You move ooh
Since that night you was all mines
You realized you chose the wrong lover
