FOREVER AIN'T ENOUGH

Mm ohohohoh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeahehyeah

Thinkin back, to the feelin that I had
When I first saw your face, I knew that it was you
Some time has passed, and the feelings
That I had before still are the same
Cause you never changed, no

Even though I dont show it girl
I just want you to know
That even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better I meant
What I said when I gave you that promise ring
That Imma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday
Feel it now girl more than ever, but with our type of love
Forever aint enough

I've been searchin my whole life
I'm lucky I found youu, no better girl too
You aint leavin cause forever ain't enough
You see me for who I am and not for who I'm not no
I'm tellin you that I'm sorry
If I tend to treat you the wrong way
But I care you know my heart is there

Even though I dont show it girl
I just want you to know
That even if we fight that
Even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better I meant what I said
When I gave you that promise ring
That Imma love you forever
I fall for youu deeper everyday
Feel it now girl more than ever
But with our type of love, forever aint enough

I've been searchin my whole life, I'm lucky I found you
No better girl too you aint leavin forever
Aint enough (forever aint enough)
Forever aint enough (forever aint enough)
Forever aint enough (forever aint enough)
Forever aint enough oo woah yea
It aint enough

Even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That Imma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday
Feel it now girl more than ever
But with our type of love, forever aint enough

Ayee I've been searchin my whole life
I'm lucky that I found you oo oo oo oh baby
