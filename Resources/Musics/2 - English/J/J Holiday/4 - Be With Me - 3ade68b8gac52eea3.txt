BE WITH ME

Be With Me 
Yo
Look i know we been,
Been friends for a minute now
But i think it's time that we
We address the situation
I know how you feel
You know how i feel

I gotta say your a hell of a woman
Like a new drought in the summer
Pull me over the weather, when i'm under
Did you know you do that for me
And i wonder sometimes, why you been taking your time
I, know this gone be right
Girl i put that on my life
Girl you be giving me the coldest sholder
You don't want you emotions taking over
Steedy talking bout you looking for a solider
Are you trinna say you don't see that in me
I know that we're friends
But taking it there won't mess it up
I... know this gone be right
Please just trust in me, girl i got you can't you see

Babygirl it's killing me
Why you trinna act like you don't
Like you don't see what i see
You should be with me
It's your heart but before you give to someone
Someone who don't deserve it, just don't hurt it baby

Like a scene from my favorite movie
Hard to control myself when u next to me
If its against the law to love you then sue me
Girl this whole thing got me in disbelief
I know it takes time
To build somethin' thats worth while but
Just in case you didn't hear me i'mma say it again more clearly
(i need ya)
Like a bed need some covers
(i need ya)
Baby we need each other
(girl i need ya)
Like a comedian needs a joke
(i need ya)
Baby i need you the most

Baby... my hearts beatin'
Cant you hear it
If i'm the music
Your my lyrics

Baby girl its killin' me ...girl it's killin me...
Why you tryna act like you don't
Like u don't see what i see (ohh ohh ohh)
(you should be with)
You should be with me
It's your heart but, before u give it to someone
Someone who don't deserve it, just don't hurt it baby
(you should be with me)

I know your lookin' out for you
(but u gotta understand)
That i'm lookin out for us too
(ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)
So baby you should just give me your heart
And i swear i wont tear it apart, no...

Baby girl its killin' me ...girl it's killin' me...
Why you tryna act like you don't
Like u don't see what i see (ohh ohh ohh)
(you should be with)
You should be with me
It's your heart but, before u give it to someone
Someone who don't deserve it, just don't hurt it baby
(you should be with me)

Why you tryna act like you don't
Like u don't see what i see
(like you don't see it)
(you should be with)
