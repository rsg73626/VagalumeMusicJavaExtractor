WRONG TURN

I got a devil and an angel on my shoulders
Gps actin up, which house I'm bout to go over
Is it mine or my baby?
Is it her? My other lady
I guess we bout to find out right about now

Now I'm in the whip
Tell my girl I was on the way over
My side chick's callin me
Begging me to come over
She said it's been a minute, she's feelin the get good
Got both over my home, waiting for me naked

Could've went to the left
But I made that right
Should've went to the left
Damn, I know that shit ain't right
Yea, I know (I know)
I know (I know)
Now I know (Now I know)

I made the wrong turn
I knew I should've took my ass home
When am I gon learn?
When am I gonna learn?
I made the wrong turn
Knew I should've took my ass home
When am I gon learn?
I know I took the wrong turn (wrong turn)

Got a condom on that nightstand
Damn I should've used it
Said she was on the pill
And I'm the only one she's
And I (and I)
Pulled out (Pulled out)
So I
I thought I was good

24 hours with no plan B
Two weeks later she end up callin me
Slangin my dick around
So carelessly
9 months later
That kid looked just like me

Should've went to the left
But I made that right
Getting up to the left
And it changed my life
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
Now I know (Now I know)

I made the wrong turn
I knew I should've took my ass home
When am I gon learn?
When am I gonna learn?
I made the wrong turn
Knew I should've took my ass home
When am I gon learn?
I know I took the wrong turn (wrong turn)

How the hell am I gon explain it to my girl?
When I just told her I'm not ready to bring kids into this world
I know she gon lose it
Burn up all my clothes
Fuck me up
And beat up that, beat up that

And she done put up with my shit forever
But she ain't bout to be disrespecting, never
I done fucked up
But it's too late
Gotta man up

I made the wrong turn
I knew I should've took my ass home
When am I gon learn?
When am I gonna learn?
I made the wrong turn
Knew I should've took my ass home
When am I gon learn?
I know I took the wrong turn (wrong turn)
