HEAVEN

I think that I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven

I can only dream, yea
I can only wonder
Cause as simple as it seems
We were made for each other baby

Now what if I never made a wrong turn that night?
And what if you played it cool and just passed me by?
In years in fading unpredicted your thing baby
Your love is now the only song that I sing baby

Girl every time I look into your eyes
It's like I see the morning sunlight
And when I see the smile upon yo face
It's like I got a glimpse of paradise
I love playing with your hair, and grabbing everywhere
I'm kissing you all through the night
God sent an angel, I'm thankful for you

It feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my sunlight
All the rain goes away
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my everything
Everything a man could dream
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Can? t even sleep, oh no
I? d rather watch you slumber
Cus you seem so at ease
Right next to me

Now what if I never took that look in your eyes
And what if you never gave me the chance to make it right
Fate is such an unpredictable thing baby
Your love is now the only song that I sing baby

It feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my sunlight
All the rain goes away
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my everything
Everything a man could dream
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

No other woman on this earth matters, no
With you right by my side
Girl I'm going throw this stormy weather
That's why I won't never walk away
I know God made you just for me
Baby you so perfect
Don't know what I did to deserve it

It feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my sunlight
All the rain goes away
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my everything
Everything a man could dream
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

I think that I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven
