I KNOW LOVE

J. Holiday.....whooo......ooh ooh ooh yeah 
why you tryin to walk out on me? Platinum brothers 
Hey hmm 
feel good don't it? 
hmm baby 

Verse 1: 
You say the thrill was gone a long time ago 
so why'd you stay so long 
if you knew the deal shoulda let me know 
why did you keep holdin on 
girl you put so much into me & I put so much in you 
I ain't gotta teach nobody I ain't gotta learn nobody new 

(Hook) 
And I know you gon trip when I come home late without callin 
I be expectin that 
Whether I'm rich or broke lovin & fussin girl you're rollin I'll take nothin less than that 

{Chorus} 
I know love has ups & downs 
And I know way to much to go & duck out now 
So why would we give this up just to go sleepin around 
You know me better than the back of your hand so don't you ever turn your back on this man 
Baby oooh 

Verse 2: 
These nights are gettin colder 
without that round thing beside me 
come up stairs & let me hold you 
oh baby why would you deny me? 
girl I know you want it too 
cuz you love the things I do to you (I do to you) baby 

(Hook) 
And I know you gon trip when I come home late without callin 
I be expectin that 
Whether I'm rich or broke lovin & fussin girl you're rollin I'll take nothin less than that 

{Chorus} 
I know love has ups & downs 
And I know way to much to go & duck out now 
So why would we give this up just to go sleepin around 
You know me better than the back of your hand so don't you ever turn your back on this man 
Baby oooh 

Just help me sing 
Baby ooh 
Baby ooh 
Help me sing 
Baby ohh 
see baby I know love 

{Chorus} 
I know love has ups & downs 
And I know way to much to go & duck out now 
So why would we give this up just to go sleepin around 
You know me better than the back of your hand so don't you ever turn your back on this man 
Baby oooh
