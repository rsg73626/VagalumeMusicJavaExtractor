FLY

(Fly, fly, fly, fly Ooh) 

I know people change but I hate we've changed. 
And its killing me trying to figure out where we are. 
Cause it aint the same, girl I'll take the blame. 
And I'm willing to take this chance that you feel we've traveled too far. 
Lord knows I wanna keep you, life without you I just can't see it. 
But sometimes you gotta let love be what it's gonna be. 
(Ooh oh) 

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me cause I do believe. 
If I let you fly then you fly back, then it was meant to be. 
So fly, fly, fly, fly. 

It was only me, taking flights over sea. 
But now it's you cause they finally realized you're a star. 
Whenever we're in the same place at the same time. 
No we don't feel the same way, I want to rewind. 
Take it back to where things made sense, I think we flown to far. 
Lord knows I wanna keep you, life without you damn, I just can't see it. 
Sometimes you gotta let love be what it's gonna be. 
(Yeah oh oh) 

I'ma let you fly and pray you come back to me cause I do believe. 
If I let you fly then you fly back, then it was meant to be. 
So fly, fly, fly, fly. 

Fly, fly, fly, and all I know to let you do is - 
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly. 
Hey, I wanna fly with you, fly, I know you, fly, I know you gotta see what you gotta see. 
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly. 
And I hope you fly back to me if I let ya'
