THUG COMMANDMENTS

Dont choke on that homeboy blow it out
Dont sip on that hen pour a little out
let your life reflect what comes outta your mouth
and never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out
never fear no man but know when to run
leave no man standing until the battle is won
and when its getting real good better pull it out
when niggas front dont give up my brother sweat it out

And dont smoke what you dont roll up
and act right if you know you cant fight(take it easy)
take a test if you unsure if its yours
theres a one percent chance that it might be another mans
and you know the life that we live in that on day we might fall(fall down)
and the only choices we givin' got our backs against the wall
and we know were all God's children hes got love for us all
this thug(this thug) this thug(this thug) commandments (we share)

Stop cuffing that dumb girl let her breathe
Be a father to your kids let hell decrease
No Du-rags in the Lords house
Trust in the lord but keep a glock in your house
when you talking to a man look him dead in his eyes
never get high on your own supply
Gotta think fast stash your little cash
why cus them snake niggas they slither in the grass

And dont smoke what you dont roll up
and act right if you know you cant fight(take it easy)

take a test if you unsure if its yours
theres a one percent chance because it might be another mans
and you know the life that we live in that on day we might fall(fall down)
and the only choices we givin' got our backs against the wall
and we know were all God's children hes got love for us all
this thug(this thug) this thug(this thug) commandments (we share)

We fall down but we get up
we sell out then we re-up
and we keep watch from the roof tops for the cops
hi snitches tap the telephone switches
we get paid but we post bail
right back slanging new story to tell
and it goes round and round like a ...
it never changes its all a game kid

and you know the life that we live in that on day we might fall(fall down)
