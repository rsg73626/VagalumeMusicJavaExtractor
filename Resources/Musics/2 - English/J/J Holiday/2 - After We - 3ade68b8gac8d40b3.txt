AFTER WE

J-Just because this beat is slow
Don't mean we can't go hard
Hold my knees up, stay right there
Speaking in tongues like I'm in Paris
Make you scream "Oh My God! "

You like it like that, So I'ma give it to ya (Give it to Ya)
No holding back, However you want I'll give it to ya
(Oh) I'm going in (Oh) I'll never end
Baby I love it when we touch, We can make love after we fuck
Ooh OOh yeah, After we fuck, We fuck
Yeaah, After we
Damn this feels so good (You're amazing)
Damn this feels so good (Gets you crazy)
I can never ever get enough, Get enough
We can make love, After We

OOh, I'm gonna make you (Scream my name)
I know you like our pleasure and pain
You're driving me crazy girl (So insane)
Bed soaking wet, Playing in the rain

You like it like that, So I'ma give it to ya (Give it to Ya)
No holding back, However you want I'll give it to ya
(Oh) I'm going in (Oh) I'll never end
Baby I love it when we touch, We can make love after we fuck
Ooh OOh yeah, After we fuck, We fuck
Yeaah, After we
Damn this feels so good (You're amazing)
Damn this feels so good (Gets you crazy)
I can never ever get enough, Get enough
We can make love, After We fuck

Playing in your hair, grabbing everywhere
The love's in the air, The air
Rubbing on ya thighs and looking in your eyes
Cuz it's time to make Loove!
There's nobody there You're the greatest ever
Let's make Loove!
Like I've been locked up for years
They just let me out, I'm about to let it out baby

You like it like that, So I'ma give it to ya (Give it to Ya)
No holding back, However you want I'll give it to ya
(Oh) I'm going in (Oh) I'll never end
Baby I love it when we touch, We can make love after we fuck
Ooh OOh yeah, After we fuck, We fuck
Yeaah, After we
Damn this feels so good (You're amazing)
Damn this feels so good (Gets you crazy)
I can never ever get enough, Get enough
We can make love, After We fuck

I ain't even supposed to be here
It's my guilty conscience
