NEVER HAD IT

Body Like A Motherf**Ker(Damn Baby You)
Ridin Like A Fed Trucker(Hold Up What U Say)
[Girl:] I Be Pleasin You, You Be Pleasin Me. Promise Me Youll Stay, And Never Leave Me.
Hold Up Let Me Say Something(Pretty Mama Think)
Why Am I Gon Tell You Something(That I Dont Mean)
Cause Were In The Heat Of The Moment, Giving You The Biz, I Came To The House And Told You Dont Be Catching Feelings 

[Chorus:]
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had A Nigga Dis Sho Put It On Ya
Askin Why I Dont Stay The Night And Hold Ya
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had Really Never Had It Had It 
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had A Young Nigga Take Da Cat From Ya
I Say I Cant Stay Got Something Else To Tend To
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had Really Had It Had It

Now Why You Gotta Make This Situation
You Met The Kid And Decided You Wanted To Dig In When I Said You Agreed That It Wouldnt Be No Static
Yes I Promise To Heat It Up
Take It Down South Girl And Eat It Up
(Never Agreed To Have Chains On Me)
When Its Time To Leave

[Chorus:]
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had A Nigga Dis Sho Put It On Ya
Askin Why I Dont Stay The Night And Hold Ya
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had Really Never Had It Had It 
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had A Young Nigga Take Da Cat From Ya
I Say I Cant Stay Got Something Else To Tend To
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had Really Had It Had It

[Bridge:]
(Damn) I Cant Lie(I Know) 
You Got Skills And(I Feel)
You Want Us To Be Close But I'm Just Not Ready To Let Go
When I'm Free To Lay My Head Where I Feel Like(Girl I Told You Once Before So Just Understand)
Can You Understand

[Chorus:]
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had A Nigga Dis Sho Put It On Ya
Askin Why I Dont Stay The Night And Hold Ya
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had Really Never Had It Had It 
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had A Young Nigga Take Da Cat From Ya
I Say I Cant Stay Got Something Else To Tend To
I Can Tell You Aint Never Had Really Had It Had It
