MAGIC MAN

Y-Yeah Yeah Yeah
Oh baby... Oh baby
I can be the one that can give you what you need
I can show you things that you thought you'd never see
I can make that candy rain fall like a storm
I can take that ice cold heart and turn it warm

I can make your pain disappear
With just one touch
Cuz I can do magic, magic
I can make your body shiver
With just one touch
Cuz I can do magic, magic
(So let me be your magic man)
Let me be your magic man
Your magic man, Your magic man
Your magic man, Your magic man
Your magic man, Your magic man
Let me be your magic man
Your magic man, Your magic man
Your magic man, Your magic man
Your magic man, Your magic man
Let me be your

Baby girl I know you don't really trust me
But how much you wanna bet
I could really make you scream
If you let me kiss your heart
I could set your heart free
(Set your heart free)
So girl let down your guard
And let me put your mind at ease

Cuz I can make your pain disappear
With just one touch (Just one touch)
Cuz I can do magic, magic

I can make your body shiver
With just one touch

Cuz I can do magic, magic
