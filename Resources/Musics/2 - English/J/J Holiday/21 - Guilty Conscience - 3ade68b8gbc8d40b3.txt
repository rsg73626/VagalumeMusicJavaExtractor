GUILTY CONSCIENCE

What goes around comes right back around
I hope all them feelings isn't true
If I was you I'd been left me by now
All the dirty shit I've done to you

Now she's a good girl
And oh she wouldn't do that to me
Because I did it to her
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Is she lyin', Is she lyin', Is it true?
Could it be I'm blamin' her for what I do?
Can't say I never thought of her fuckin' another nigga
But I guess it shouldn't matter

It's my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
It's funny how the tables turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
It's my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
It's funny how the tables turn, maybe I deserve to hurt

She cheated, like I cheated
Do she be fuckin' that nigga, like I be fuckin' them bitches
Do that nigga be layin' up in my house?
Like I be layin' in them other bitches house?

I... I deserve it

Ohh Ohh Ohh, Yeaa

My guilty... conscience

Baby!
