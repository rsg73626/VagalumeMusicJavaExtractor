[Verse 1:]
My Baby Momma Keep Stressin Me
Talkin Bout Im Pass Due On A Cup Of Cheese
I Said Wory Bout Your Money Next Week 
Cause Right Now Im High And Can Not See Girl 
I Hate The Job That I Morkin At 
So When I Get Off Imma Cop A Sack 
And Get So High Drift To The Sky Smokin That 
La La La La La La

[Chorus:]
Gimme That Hydro To Free My Soul 
I Wanna Get Lost In That Purple Smoke And Drift Away 
But I Dont Think Yall Hear Me (Yeah)
Gimme That Hydro To Free My Soul 
I Wanna Get Lost On That Purple Smoke And Drift Away (Ooh Yeahh Woo)

[Verse 2:]

Imma Worry Bout Towin It Another Day 
Imma Call Up My Boy To Come Pick Me Up 
And We Gone Cop A 50 Bag And Get F**Ked Up Cause I 
Wanna Get So High 
Red Blood Shot Eyes 
And I Cant Lie Right Now Im High Off That 
La La La La La La La La La La La (Hey)

[Chorus:]
Gimme That Hydro To Free My Soul 
I Wanna Get Lost In That Purple Smoke And Drift Away 
Gimme That Hydro To Free My Soul 
I Wanna Get Lost In That Purple Smoke And Drift Away
