SUFFOCATE

Now Even Though I Try To Play It Off. 
I'm Thinking 'Bout You All Day Long And
I Can't Wait For Shorty To Come Through
From Your Lips And Neck
To Your Eyes, My Hands On Your Hips Homie Grind I'm Fantazing
'Bout What I'm Gon' Do To You. 
You Got Me Fiending For Her Love (Can't Lie)
Man You Should See How She Got Me
Spending All This Time With Her (With Her)
I Couldn't Leave Her If I Wanted To Her Love Turns Me Into Fool 
Tell Me What A Man Is To Do.

[Chorus:]
Cause I Can't Breathe When You Talk To Me,
I Can't Breathe When You're Touching Me
I Suffocate When You're Away From Me 
So Much Love You Take From Me
I'm Going Out Of My Mind

I Can't Breathe When You Talk To Me,
I Cant Breathe When You're Touching Me
I Suffocate When You're Away From Me 
So Much Love You Take From Me
I'm Going Out Of My Mind

Whenever We Up In This Bed And My Finger Fall In Your Hair,
I Wonder If You Feel Me Watching You
Cause I Can't Go A Night Without Your Lovin' 
Got Me Lookin At This Phone 
Everytime It Rings I Hope Its You (Girl)
Got Me Bracin Through Ur Love (And I) I Ve Fallen For U 
I (Cant Lie) I Just Wanna Be With U
And Yes She Got Me there I Said It
Somebody Call The Paramedics 
Tell Them To Hurry Up And Come Through. 

[Chorus: x2]
Cause I Can't Breathe (Cant Breathe) When you talk to Me 
And I Cant Breathe When you're Touching Me (When Your Touching Me)
I Suffocate When You're Away From Me 
So Much Love You Take From  Me 
I'm Going Out Of My Mind (I'm Going Out Of My Mind) 

I Can't Breathe When You Talk To Me 
I Can't Breathe When You're Touching Me
I Suffocate When You're Away From Me 
So Much Love You Take From Me 
I'm Going Out Of My Mind
don't Never Leave Me Girl I Need You 
Inside My World I Can't Go A Day Without You 
And See Nobody Else Would Love But you 
I'll Never Feel Like I Feel With You Cause I

[Chorus:]
I Can't Breathe When You Talk To Me
I Can't Breathe When You're Touching Me 
(cant breath when you're touching me )
I Suffocate When You're Away From Me
So Much Love You Take From Me
I'm Going Out Of My Mind ( I'm Going Out Of My Mind) 
I Cant Breathe When You're Touching Me (I Cant Breathe) 
Suffocate When You're Away From Me So Much Love You Take From Me.
I'm Going Out Of My Mind (I'm Going Out Of My Mind).
Ouhh No No ... I Can't Breathe
Ouhh No No I Can't Breathe 
Ouhh No No I Can't Breathe 
Ouuhhhhhh Woo Ouhh 
Ouhh No No I Cant Breathe 
Ohh No No I Cant Breathe (I Cant Breathe).
