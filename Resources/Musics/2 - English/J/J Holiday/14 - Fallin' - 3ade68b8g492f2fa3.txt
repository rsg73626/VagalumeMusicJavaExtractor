FALLIN'

I'm half gone cause my lady ain't here. I been smoking and drinking, just sittin here in my chair. Tears are steady fallin', I can't stop make em' stop. I keep falling deeper baby. I
ain't been the same since ya left with my heart.

One minute it was good the next it was bad. I wonder waht happened to what we had. Girl you
just left me without a sign; I need you back before I lose my mind.

Girl I'm fallin' and I can't get up baby. I'm fallin' and I can't get up baby. I'm fallin' and
I can't get up babe, I'm falling deeper, deeper...deeper.

I got everything but I don't have you. I can't help but think about the thigns we used to
do. Don't wanna hang in the streets cause I don't wanna find no one new. Girl you got ya hooks
in me, got me stuck like glue.

Girl I'm fallin' and I can't get up baby. I'm falling and I can't get up baby. I'm falling and
I can't get up babe, I'm falling deeper, deeper...deeper.

Can you come catch me because I think that I've reached the end of my rope. Girl, I just
refuse to believe that we've reached the end of the road.

Girl I'm fallin' and I can't get up baby. I'm fallin' and I can't get up baby. I'm falling and
I can't get up babe, I'm falling deeper, deeper...deeper.
