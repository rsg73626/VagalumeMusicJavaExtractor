LIGHTS GO OUT

[Verse 1:]
Weve flirted I've heard it all befor you want to show me now.
I've sat in waited filled my head with dout
.I didn't think you come around and see it my way.
But you build up all the courage now.
Tonight your the water and I'm ride your waves today.

[Chorus:]
So shawty wait intill the light go out
there's no more talking and no more teasing 
nothing but pleasing .
Wait intill the lights go out
 let's loose the power for about a hour 
.oooooh 
Shawty wait intill the light go out.[2 times]

[Verse 2:]
I never told you that the way
 you be talking to me sights my whole world. 
But now it's class time girl
 if you don't mind let's show and tell 
I got in good with your best friend [2 times] 

so that you never forget me
And all that trash we be talking to her it's entertaing.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
If you ready hold it steady girl let's get into
Turn off the mood if the blinds but some shade to it
Put your body in postion for submission
Straight shoveling while I'm digging no need a electrieian
oooh when the lights.

[Chorus]
