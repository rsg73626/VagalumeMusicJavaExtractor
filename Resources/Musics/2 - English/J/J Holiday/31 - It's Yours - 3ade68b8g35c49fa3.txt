Street Love... Holiday

Ay Ay
All I wanna do is please you.
Come into this room & let me show you
How it feel (how it feel)
Love is real (love is real)
Know that I could never get enough
If I ain't never been here before
The more I get

Touch me baby
I just love to do it do it d-do it do it d-do it do it to you

[Refrão]
Grab my body baby
Hold my heart don't break it
It is yours (it is yours)
It is yours (it is yours)
It is yours (it is yours)
And I could never get enough
Grab my body baby
Hold my heart don't break it
It is yours (it is yours)
