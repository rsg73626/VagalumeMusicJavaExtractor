YOU SHOULD BE WITH ME

[Verse 1:]
I Gotta Say Your A Hell Of A Woman, Your Like A New Drop In Summer
Pull Me Over The Weather When I'm Under
Coz U Know You'd Do That For Me ....Do That For Me...And I Wonder Sometimes Why You Be Takin Your Time I
I Know Its Gon Be Right Girl I Put That On My Life
You Be Givin Me The Coldest Shoulder
Coz U Dont Want Your Emotions Takin Over
Instead Of Talkin Bout You Lookin For A Soldier... Yeah
Are U Tryna Say You Dont See That In Me
I Know That Were Freinds But Taken It Ther Wont Mess It Up
Please just Trust In Me Girl I Got To Cant You See? (Ohhhh Ohhh)

[Chorus:]
Baby Girl It's Killin Me
Why You Tryna Act Like You Dont
Like U Dont See What I See
(You Should Be With)
You Should Be With Me
Fix Your Heart Up Before U Give It To Someone (Ohh)
Someone Who Don't Deserve It, Just Dont Hurt It Baby
(You Should Be With Me)

[Verse 2:]
Like A Scene From My Favorite Movie
Hard To Control Myself When U Next To Me
If Its Against The Law To Love Then Sue Me
Girl This Whole Thing Got Me In Disbelief
I Kno It Takes Time
To Build Somethin Thats Worth While But
Just In Case You Didn't Hear Me Imma Say It Again More Clearly
(I Need Ya)
Like A Bed Need Some Covers
(I Need Ya)
Baby We Need Each Other
(Girl I Need Ya)
Like A Comedian Needs A Joke
(I Need Ya)
Baby I Need You The Most

Baby... My Hearts Beatin
Cant You Hear It
If Im The Music
Your My Lyrics

[Chorus:]
Baby Girl Its Killin'me ...Girl It's Killin Me...
Why You Tryna Act Like You Don't
Like U Don't See What I See (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
(You Should Be With)
You Should Be With Me
Fix Your Heart Up Before U Give It To Someone
Someone Who Don't Deserve It, Just Dont Hurt It Baby
(You Should Be With Me)

I Know Your Lookin Out For You
(But U Gotta Understand)
That Im Lookin Out For Us Two
(Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh)
So Baby You Should Just Give Me Your Heart
And I Swear I Wont Tear It Apart, No...

[Chorus: Slow'd Down]
Baby Girl Its Killin Me
Why You Tryna Act Like You Dont
Like U Dont See What I See
(Like You Don't See It)
(You Should Be With)

Fix Your Heart Up Before U Giv It To Someone
(Baby Fix Your Heart Before You Do With It What You Want To ..)
Someone Who Don't Deserve Just Dont Hurt It Baby...I Just Wanna Tell You... That...
(You Should Be With Me)

[Chorus:]
