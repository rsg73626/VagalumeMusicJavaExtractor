LIKE YESTERDAY

Trust the warmth inside can you feel my love alive
Like yesterday...today will pass as if nothing is
wrong
Please don`t tell me why
I turn around to you but i won't ask the reason you
sent me away

I know it wasn't the easiest thing to say to me
I thought about how hard it was
But i can't hide my tears...

So baby trust the warmth inside can you feel my love
alive

Trust the warmth inside can you feel my love alive
Like yesterday...today will pass as if nothing is
wrong
Please don`t tell me why
I turn around to you but i won't ask the reason you
sent me away

I wasn't good enough for you...
So i always wondered when the end would come
Then i told myself...i'd walk away from you smiling
So you wouldn't feel bad for me...and so i wouldn't
regret it
So that this could all be a sweet memory

So baby faith is all we need it was love that set us
free
Like the first...the end comes without a word
But love forever lives
I won't be able to see you again...but you'll live
forever in my heart

If you ever miss me like the first time...
You can come back to me
Don`t you know i love you

Trust the warmth inside can you feel my love alive
Like yesterday...today will pass as if nothing is
wrong
Please don`t tell me why
I turn around to you but i won't ask the reason you
sent me away
