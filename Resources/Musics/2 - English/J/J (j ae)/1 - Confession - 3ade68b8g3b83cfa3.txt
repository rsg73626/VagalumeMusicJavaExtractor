CONFESSION

When I look into your eyes and see
All I see is you and me
Can't you see the want within my heart?
It's all about you 

Love to hear you voice at night
It softly calling out my name
Boy you're sending chills straight down my spine
With your caresses
You got me fiening for you love
You know you're all I'm thinking of 

Baby never leave me
Can't you see, you're all I want oh yeah
Maybe, you were sent from up above
Baby, know you're all I'm dreaming of
When I look into your eyes and see
All I see is you and me
Can't you see the want within my heart? 

It's all about you
If you hold me in your arms tonight
Boy I'll make you feel just right
Stay with me, you'll never need to find another lover 

My reflection in you eyes
So softly takes my breath away
Boy you fill me up with your sweet love
there is no other
