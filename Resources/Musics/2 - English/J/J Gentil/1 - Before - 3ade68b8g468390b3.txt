BEFORE

I saw your soul
Before I see
Anything else

The glimpse you draw
into my eyes
I'll never forget
yeah

Our truth
The piece of me
I saw on you
hmm

All the secrets
I told the world
but they never knew
It was always you

(Corus)
Before What happened turn you into this
Before I see you as my memory
I didn't wanna share it
but if I don't speak out
how will I know
that you're real?

I learned
about myself
about someone
I didn't know

I loved
with all my soul
and I still do
will always be you

(Corus)
even though I turned you into this
even though I see you as my memory
I didn't wanna share it
but if I don't speak out
How will I know
that you were real?
