LIKE YESTERDAY

I just remember what I said
It seems that happened yesterday
I hurt you, I hurt me
Like if I'll never find my way

I wish you were here with me
Every time I wake I intend to be
A new person, a better person to you

it's not because I'm losing that I'm lost
it's not because l made a mistake
that I can see you go away

(Corus)
And I can't leave you right now
I don't want to learn to live without you
And let our heart going around
it's like winter inside me
All I can see is your mouth
Begging for a kiss and make me think
And make me thinking about
The reasons that just let me say
Do you wanna date with me?

Remember all the words I said
when I saw your face at the first day
and think about the promises that I have done
I just remember what I said
It seems that happened yesterday
You can trust me and I love you
Like I will never love again

it's not because you had gone that I forgot you
it's not because you can go away
that I can give up on you
