TRY

Forget your pride
Forget your prejudice
Just say you'll try
Just say you'll try

Forget your pride
Forget your prejudice
Just say you'll try

To see me different
To bet I'm good
To see me through
To see me through

Put down you walls
The bricks that you build
And ask more about me
Behind the songs
You saw the history
You're always listening

(Chorus)
I want to wake you up tomorrow and see how it feels like
To get to know your humor when you see me by your side
Can't wait to listen all your talking
ideas and your dreams
And stop being afraid of what's gonna be of you and me
