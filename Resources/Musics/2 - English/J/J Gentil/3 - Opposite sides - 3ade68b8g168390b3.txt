OPPOSITE SIDES

We are passing through each other
as we do we don't see it
we are on opposite sides
going against time and possibilities

we are passing through each other
as I close my eyes I can imagine
you're looking at me and I can't see you, but
now I'm looking through this crowd for you
Running to your arms and finding
what I've been looking for

(Corus)
I'm always walking, changing, searching
Someone might understand me
Running and hiding, hearing quietly
They're always speaking, they're always knowing
but as I hear what you say
all I can see is salvation and hope

we are passing through each other
as I close my eyes I can imagine
you're looking at me and I can't see you, but
now I'm looking through this crowd for you
Running to your arms and finding
what I've been looking for

(Corus)

Maybe I'll see you when I open my eyes
maybe it was just a dream
perhaps I'll now your name and you'll trust me
perhaps you were never here

(Corus)
I don't wanna walk, change, search it
'cause you can understand me
still running and hiding, hearing quietly
they're always speaking but you seem to know it
and as I heard what you said
all I could see was you saving my hope
