SMOKING AT THE HIGHSCHOOL

She says she's goin away
She's headed for LA
She says she's goin away
She's headed for LA

We stayed out late on our first date
To get a tatoo on you
I prommised that i'd never leave you
(Her too)

You still work at the Connico
At the corner of sixth and melrose
And your forehead still says "<3 JB"
Now i don't call u but you call me

I am the guy who your parents all try to keep
away from you
I'm that dude who acts real rude when her mommy and her daddy wana meet u

She says she's goin away
She's headed for LA
She says she's goin away
She's headed for LA

Day breaks and i called you back today
And your so stoked cause i baked u a birthday cake
Well it oughta put and end to your gladness
When you discover that it was laced
And it oughta put an end to ur fattness
After how many doses you ate

I am tha guy that your parents all try to get
Away from you
Yes i am tha dude who's 22
Still smokin at the highschool

Smokin at the highschool
Smokin at the highschool
Smokin at the highschool

She get's a blue dress on
She put's a boob lift on
She puts her makeup on
And the lipstick on her face

She's got an eye for color
And a sense of style
She's got a flair for fasshon
Low self esteem
She's got an eye for color
And a sense of style
(you look Marvelous)
She's got a flair for fasshon
(A Flair A Flair!)
Low self esteem
