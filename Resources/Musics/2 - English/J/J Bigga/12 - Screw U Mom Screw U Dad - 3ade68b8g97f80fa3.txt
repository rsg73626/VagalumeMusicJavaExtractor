SCREW U MOM SCREW U DAD

Are you ready for the sickness
Mother father your not gona believe this
I'ts four twenty and the whole blocks screamin
40 oz wife beat ho's feinding
Hot boxin an escalade
We can't pick a lane cause we so faded
Pop pop we about gettin paid
Stack it up pack it up light it up blaze it

Screw u mom screw u dad
The'res no way in hell i'm turnin out like that
Screw u mom screw u dad
I'd rather die than be like that
Screw u mom and screw u dad
I'm not another victim to your plans

It seems imposible
When they load us on a buss
And they lock us in a classroom
But we'll see who acts a fool
Cause the lesson is corrupt like a corporate scandal
This shiv is loaded
BXaXcX you can stick this in your twisted agendas
And it's time we smoked it
Then they hit us and cuff us and claim to defend us

Screw u mom screw u dad
The'res no way in hell i'm turnin out like that
Screw u mom screw u dad
I'd rather die than be like that
Screw u mom and screw u dad
I'm not another victim to your plans

Unless your paid no one wants you
Then you pay them and they've got you
Expect you to act like you don't care
A new kind of slavery is everywhere

It's better to be free (fight the power)
Than to be a slave to the machine
It's better to be free (fight the power)
Then to be a slave to the machine

Screw u mom and screw u dad
I'm not another victim to your plans
I'd rather die than be like that
