ICE COLD BLONDE

Oops don't mind my fish mouth
while i stare at you stiff drool coming out
I'm telling you honestly your goddessly
it' crushes me just to look at you
my fingers and toes all suddenly froze
I'm terrified and embarrassed by you


Stand Back Look out below
She takes what she wants
and she wants you

she's an ice cold blond
she'll make you work
she's an ice cold blond
she'll make you work
She's an ice cold blond
and she's chilling in the front row
she drove an hour and a half to our show


You lied to my face
i still lick it up
i know that you drop things
just to see me pick em up


Stand Back Look out below
She takes what she wants
and she wants you

she's an ice cold blond
she'll make you work
she's an ice cold blond
she'll make you work
She Burns me to death
She Works me to death
She's an ice cold blond
and she's chilling in the front row
she drove an hour and a half to our show

What did you say
when the room was spinning
i couldn't even finish you
last Tuesday
when my hands were slipping
i had to take a sip of you

She works me to death
and i love her to death
she burns me to death
and i love her to death
(ice cold)
(ice cold
and she's chilling in the front row
she drove an hour and a half to our show
(ow)
