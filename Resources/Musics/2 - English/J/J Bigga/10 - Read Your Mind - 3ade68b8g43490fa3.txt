READ YOUR MIND

I walk down Hayes
To tha rooftops where we used to kick it there
It's getting late
Just leave us alone
We're in love and we don't care
We're finally cool enough
To bend back on the bottle
And let up on the throttle

(whispers)

Last night i dreamed
I can read your mind
And then u said
I can read your mind

Hold my face in your warm hands
Till the very last second of our last dance
Theres no point left in making plans
Cos theres nothing but death in our romance
(echo)

This life is twisted you can get it if you listen
This life will burn you but I'll never let it hurt you

Last night i dreamed
I can read your mind
And then u said
I can read your mind

I never plan on cheating
Until my heart stops beating
I promise it's forever
Until the end of never
(whispers)

Last night i dreamed
I can read your mind
And then u said
I can read your mind
(Hold my face in your warm hands)
(till the very last second of our last dance)
(theres no point left in making plans)
(cos theres nothing but death in our romance)

Last night i dreamed i could read your mind
