ON THE NIGHT THAT SHE WALKS AWAY

Her heart
was broke
an empty bottle 
and a note

that's when
she needs to hear u say

tell her she's beautifull
and you want her to stay

tell her dat
next time she walks away.....

your love is true
so why she's leavin u?
ask her dat 
next time she walks away

tell her you love the way 
that she looks you in the eye
tell her that
next time that you two fight

----------(pik it up)


tell her dat her hair looks great
whe she does it that way

tell her dat
next time that she walks away

tell her that your life 
would never be the same

tell her Dat
next time she walks away

beg her to stop..
turn around
and listen what you say

beg her dat!
next time she walks away

tell her not to get hot 
and that you would do it right

tell her that ...
on the night that she walks away

beg her that..., on the night that she walks away
