KISS ME LIKE YOU'RE DYING (KISS ME IN THE RAIN)

Kiss me in tha rain
kiss me in tha rain
(this is ours)
right now
we got a lock on tha door
and tha music seems to scream out
keep out
i love it when you do
what i said i shouldn't do with you
right now we got a lot to waste
and a beautiful love tonight
we should be happier
shouldn't we?
So kiss me like yer dying
i can't sleep at all without you in my bed
your tha best song of all stuck inside my head
kiss me in tha rain
kiss me in tha rain
(this is our time)
you look just like an angel
but looks can be deceiving
i called your house
just to ask you out
but you have other plans this evening
so kiss me like your dying i can't sleep at all without you in my bed

your tha best song of all stuck inside my head
you are tha best song to sing along to stuck inside my head
So kiss me like your dying
you are tha best song to sing along to stuck inside my head
you are tha best song to sing along to stuck inside my head
kiss me in tha rain and kiss me like your dying
kiss me in tha rain and kiss me like your dying(this is our music)
