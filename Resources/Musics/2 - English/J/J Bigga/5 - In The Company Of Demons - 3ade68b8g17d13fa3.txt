IN THE COMPANY OF DEMONS

(She's In the company of deamons)
(she's in the company of friends)

one beer two tears
he was supposed to meet her here
she waited
he never made it
she drank up, got the bill and paid it

she's all dressed up with perfume again
but she ends up in my room again
she stomps out a smoke
she's drunk again 
she shaved her legs to get dumped again

she's in the company of deamons
watch her fail
it's such a tragic afair
when she's sittin there

she 's in the company of deamons
she's in the company of friendz

the clock ticks away 
her heart beats away
she's waiting to die

the clock ticks away
the cloth is getting frayed
she's hating her life

the blood stains
and the spider veins
and the bad dates
that stick in her mind

the time passes by
she's wasted her life
and she 's wating to die

she likes to ride with the top down
from the make out spot
to the flop house

she'll never get it together
no the girl will never change

she's in the company of deamons 
watch her fail
it's such a tragic afair
when she's sitting there

she's in the company of deamons 
watch her fail
it's such a tragic afair
when she's sittin there

she's all dressed up with perfume agian
but she ends up in my room again
she steps on a smoke
she's drunk again
she shaved her legs to get dumped again

(She's In the company of deamons)
(she's in the company of friends)
(She's In the company of deamons)
(she's in the company of friends)
