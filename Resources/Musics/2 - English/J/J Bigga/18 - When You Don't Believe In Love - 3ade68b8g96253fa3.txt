WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE

(slot machine sound)
your asleep but hee's awake
he's too in love to pull the shades

you sleep right thru

he's too ashamed 
and he turns away

i would never have known it
every time that i've blown it
always keeping the score
always wanting more

but none of the rules apply 
sitting with you tonight
under the beautifull sky!
(oh oh)

WHEN U DON'T BELIVE IN LOVE
WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE!
(slot machine sound)

She get's his call but she doesn't pik up
he's so in love so he won't give up

she sets the phone
down by the side of the bed
i guess she'd rather be alone

i would never have known it
every time that i've blown it
always keepin the score
always wanting more
but none of the rules apply
under the hot sun light
i've waited my whole life
and it feels just right!

WHEN U DON'T BELIVE IN LOVE
WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE!
WHEN U DON'T BELIVE IN LOVE
WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE!

When love leaves u
(oh oh oh oh)
then we'll see who
(oh oh oh oh)
could get out
(oh oh oh oh)
without their heart ripped out
When love leaves u
(oh oh oh oh)
then we'll see who
(oh oh oh oh)
could get out (OUT OUT)
(oh oh oh oh)
without their heart ripped out

WHEN U DON'T BELIVE IN LOVE
WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE!
i would never have known it
every time that i've blown it
always keepin the score
always wanting more
WHEN U DON'T BELIVE IN LOVE
WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE!
