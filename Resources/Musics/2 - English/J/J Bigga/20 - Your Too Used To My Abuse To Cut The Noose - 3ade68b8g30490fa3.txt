YOUR TOO USED TO MY ABUSE TO CUT THE NOOSE

What would you do if you fell in love with me
Would you settle down and stop breaking hearts
Somewhere there's a 24 hour place
Where we can just make out
For the rest of our daze

Your too used to the abuse to cut the noose
Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose
You should break up with me

Who would you scream at if it wasn't for me being bad
I'm the only one you have but when your mad you forget that
It' was midnight when i called u trying to get a ride
And you yelled at me the whole time
And yer voice sounded green cos I was high on magic mushrooms

Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose
Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose
Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose
(You should break up with me)
Your so addicted to my tank it's almost sick
(You should break up with me)

I shut the coffin door and nailed you in
You kept on screaming so I buried it
Don't be so mean to my friend
You hardly know her
You like the same kind of things
Like i like both u and her

Just let her kiss you on the lips
It's real hott when she sucks on your finger tips
She never chokes when she deep throat's like you

Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose
Your too used to the abuse to cut the noose
Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose
(you should break up with me)
Your too used to my abuse to cut the noose

You should break up with me (6X)
