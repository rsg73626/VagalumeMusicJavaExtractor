First i stroll in late with my eyelids low
Miss doo doo there tried to send me home
And it's fine by me so i don't debate it
Then i skip to tha ave and i get real faded
Then i stroll to the house with my eyelids droopin
But ya got kicked out cause you was acktin stoopid
And yer sick of yer dad and your mom's goin crazy
The're so full of crap
"and your callin me lazy?"

But i won't be there to care
And i wrote screw u with the number two
But i won't be there to care

So grab your mama's keys
And be like bigga please
