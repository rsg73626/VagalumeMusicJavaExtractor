WAY TOO LOUD

Way Too Loud
I know this girl who sleeps around

her parents yell and she walks out

she thinks the world is out to
Bring her down

she turns it up and rolls the
Windows Down

She's way too loud
she's way too loud
Too loud
Too Loud
Too Loud
Too Loud

she knows this boy who's always down
and when he smiles she's not around

He says it's too boring in this
quiet town

his radio is always
Way too Loud

He's way too loud
He's way too loud
Too loud
Too Loud
Too Loud
Too Loud

There getting kicked out u kno
for bein'
Way too loud
Cause when their makin out
she's like Uhh Uhh
and he's like UHHH
Way too loud

Their way too loud
Their way too loud
Too loud
Too Loud
Too Loud
Too Loud

She's always down to ride
and he's always up all night
you can see them walkin by
if you sneak out tonight
She's always down to ride
and he's always up all night
you can see them walkin by
if you sneak out tonight

(if you sneak out tonight)

Their way too loud
Their way too loud
Their way too loud
Their way too loud

Too loud (8x)
