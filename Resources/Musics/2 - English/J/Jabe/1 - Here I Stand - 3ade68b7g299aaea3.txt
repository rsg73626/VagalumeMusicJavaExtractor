HERE I STAND

Finally has come the day
and here i stand in the corner 
where i once said i would wait
for you
Remembering words once spoken
feelings once shared
dreams once dreamt
with you
Wishing you were here to see me
a bit too late i keep my promise
here i stand with my guitar
and you're nowhere in sight
Remembering words once spoken
feelings once shared
dreams once dreamt
with you
It's not that i want you back
it's that i never had you to begin with
i don't want you to here to stay
i just wish you could see me today
All i can do is
Remember words once spoken
feelings once shared
dreams once dreamt
with you
