KNOW HIM

Hook

Ooh how can people live without Him?
How can people pray and doubt Him?
How could you hate things about Him – when you don’t know Him?
Ooh, He came into this world to save us
Would you have done the same for haters – no
I don’t need to beg but I will
Until I can get u to know Him

Verse I

Who do you think woke you up this morning?
Who do you think kept you through the night?
Who do you think made the air you’re breathing?
Jesus
Who do you think gives the ability to see?
Jesus, the Creator of man

Who do you think gives the car you drive?
Who do you think cuts your piece of the pie?
Who do you think controls death or life?
It’s Jesus
Who do you think holds the fate of each day that we see?
Jesus, the Son of man
I don’t see how anyone could ever be without Him

Hook/Verse II

Who do you think made the ocean blue?
Who do you think made the flowers bloom?
Who do you think gives the wind that soothes it?
Jesus (the beginning and the end)
Who do you think handmade every fish in the sea?
Jesus, the Creator of man
Who do you think could ever love so much?
Who do you think could heal from a touch?
Who do you think would’ve died for us?
Jesus
Who do you think could give all us life eternally?
Jesus, the Son of man
I don’t see how anyone could ever be without Him
