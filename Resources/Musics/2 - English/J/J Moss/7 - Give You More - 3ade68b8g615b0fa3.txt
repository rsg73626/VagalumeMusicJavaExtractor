GIVE YOU MORE

J MOSS GIVE YOU MORE


Showing my love will be faithful
Proving my heart won't change
Giving You more than the day before
For no day will be the same
Giving You time of substance
Maintaining the place that you dwell in
Deeper than the ocean floor
I never want us to end

I wanna give You more
I wanna share my life with You
More than money can pay for
Allow me to give You more
I have so much to say
The minute I see You face to face
More than an army can fight for
Allow me to give You more

Paying attention to detail
Letting no praise go unspoken
Joy streaming from heart to heart
That they may never be broken
Giving my mind, body, and soul
To show You how much I am grateful
To have and hold You close to me
That I may never be alone

I wanna give You more
I wanna share my life with You
More than money can pay for
Allow me to give You more
I have so much to say
The minute I see You face to face
More than an army can fight for
Allow me to give You more

Like a tree is to a leaf
You are what I need to breathe
Words can't explain the affection that I have for You
I wanna be what brings to You
A smile on Your face
Because You're gettin more from my heart
More from my soul each day, each day

I wanna give You more
I wanna share my life with You
More than money can pay for
Allow me to give You more
I have so much to say
The minute I see You face to face
More than an army can fight for
Allow me to give You more

I wanna give You more
I wanna share my life with You
More than money can pay for
Allow me to give You more
I have so much to say
The minute I see You face to face
More than an army can fight for
Allow me to give You more

I wanna give You more
