WORK YOUR FAITH

[Verse 1]
My brothers and sisters 
Bring your problems to the altar 
And leave your burdens there 
Though you're troubled, God is able, just work your faith

[Verse 2]
Friends and neighbors 
It doesn't matter how you falter 
Grab a hold of God's outstreached hand 
He's a wonder, He never sleeps or slumbers, just work your faith

[Verse 3]
Mothers and fathers 
Bring your sons and your daughters 
He will leave no work undone... 
Now tell the nation 
Of the revelation

[Bridge 1]
That He will give you 
More than what you're asking 
Life everlasting 
Just work your faith

[Verse 4]
As I see the tears run down your face 
Don’t you let your doubt conquer your faith 
I can see you wonder if He's there 
Don’t you worry, you're His child and He cares

[Bridge 2]
And He will give you more 
Than what you're asking 
Life everlasting 
More than what you're asking 
Life everlasting

[Vamp]
More, more, more, more 
More, more, more, more

More, more, more, more 
More, more, more, more

[Ending]
He will give you more than what you're asking, life everlasting. 
More than what you're asking, life everlasting 
Just work your faith
