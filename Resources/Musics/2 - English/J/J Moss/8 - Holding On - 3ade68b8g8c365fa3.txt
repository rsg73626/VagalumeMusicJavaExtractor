HOLDING ON

Verse I
Sometimes it makes you wanna cry aloud
Sometimes it makes you wanna scream and shout
Sometimes you feel like it’s unbearable
Sometimes the pain is so incredible
Why do I feel the way I feel being a Christian and all?
It’s not supposed to be this way
But who said that it was gonna be easy – nobody
Do I have enough in me?

Hook
How do I feel like holding on?
How do I feel like being strong?
How do I feel like praying on?
How do I feel like pressing on?
And the answer is Jesus

Verse II
Sometimes it’s someone that you really love
Sometimes they don’t know that they’ve lost your trust
Sometimes your heart will ask can it stop beating
Why do I feel the way I do being a Christian and all?
It’s not supposed to be this way
But who said that the walk would be easy – nobody
Do I have enough in me?

Hook (x2)
