THE OTHER SIDE OF VICTORY

I see now that you really care about me
God thank you for delivering me
To the other side of victory
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah

Oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm thinking about my journey
I'm thinking about the ways you made
The power of your loving hand
And when all over circumstance
You teach by example
To have respect for the mantle
Within the fight we're not alone
The victory is on the throne

I was once blind but now I see
Your extended grace through me
You shed your blood
And you shouldered on calvary

I see now that you really care about me
God thank you for delivering me
From the hands of my enemies
Yeah (yeah)
I see now that you really care about me
God thank you for delivering me
To the other side of victory
Yeah
Oh oh ooh

Seeing walls all around
Thinking they're gonna fall down
If I depended on man
I would never reach for your hand
But you are there all the time
Not just story in my mind
Just like the walls of jericho
If I scream then it's gotta go

Oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

The other side of victory
You gotta go through the storm to get there
Don't wait till the battle is over
Shout now! It's coming!
