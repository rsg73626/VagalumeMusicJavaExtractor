WE MUST PRAISE

If I were a drummer, I would use my cymbal
If I were a writer, I would use a pencil
I would use my voice, If I were a singer
No matter who or what we are, we must praise

If I were a doctor, I would use my research
A prolific dissertation, if I was a speaker
I would use my hands, If I were a potter
No matter who or what we are must praise

Chorus:
Let the people of God bless him
Let it ring with love and truth
With our gifts we exalt thee
Merciful, wonderful God
We must Praise

If I were an eagle, I would use my wing
Since I?m a believer, I use everything
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord
All ye people
No matter who or what we are we must praise

(Back to Chorus)

(Vamp) Praise his holy name (x5)
With our gifts we exalt thee
Merciful wonderful God
Oh Hallelujah, of glory, oh holy of holies
Oh bread of life God, oh meat of hungry Lord
Water of thirst Lord, we magnify you
We thank You for what You?ve done God
What You?re doing God and what You?re gonna do
No matter who or what you are, we must praise
