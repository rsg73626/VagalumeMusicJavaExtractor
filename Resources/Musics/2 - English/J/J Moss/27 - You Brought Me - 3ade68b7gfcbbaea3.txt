YOU BROUGHT ME

I need to know why You do for me the things you do
I need to know why You care for me
I need to know why You cover me the way You do
I need to know why You’re there for me

Even when I’m not worthy, even when I don’t deserve it
You’re doing something for me
Even when I don’t obey, 
You never throw me away

CHORUS:
You brought me out, now I can shout
I’ll never doubt, what You can do
You picked me up, You filled my cup
I’ll always trust, what You can do

I need to know why You stay with me the way You do
I need to know why You put up with me
I need to know why You answer me when I call
I need to know why You never leave me
Even when I’m not worthy, even when I don’t deserve Thee
Even when I don’t obey, You never throw me away

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
Is it because, You love us so much, You do it
Is it because, You are the Savior, You do it
Is it because, You come that we might live,
You do it.
But as for me, I’m glad that You do, You do it

RAP:
I topped it off with a shot of PaJam up the wrist
But I ain’t never had a bottle of Cris…
Patiently waitin’ for my date and time for my life to shine.
With the Lord on my mind
But I slipped and fell out of His will
My own agenda had me trying to pay the bills
Momma must’ve been on her knees
Because the wicked had the keys to dream
But He bought me out
