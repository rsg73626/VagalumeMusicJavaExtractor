NOBODY

I was looking in the mirror last night but I don't like what I see
Looking at the reflection but I don't like what's looking at me
Too light or too dark or too big or too small
Or always pulling out the measurement stick and forever coming up short
Don't be ashamed for God has arranged
Worth more than a billionaire exclusively engineered

Nobody is a nobody God doesn't make mistakes
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exist in grace
We all may fall (we all may fall) some may stall
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes
All in all God doesn't make mistakes

I was looking at the TV last night and everyone's better than me
Big car, big house, big dreams are things my life won't see
Too shy or too bold or too nice or too cold
Or always looking at a half empty glass and always coming up last
Don't be ashamed God has arranged it
Worth more than a billionaire exclusively engineered (Nobody)

Nobody is a nobody God doesn't make mistakes
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exist in grace
We all may fall (we all may fall) some may stall
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes
All in all God doesn't make mistakes

Spread your wings (spread your wings)
Don't let nobody tell you the battle is lost it belongs to God
Lift your head and pray you will win
Believe you will gain

Nobody is a nobody God doesn't make mistakes
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exist in grace
We all may fall (we all may fall) some may stall
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes
All in all God doesn't make mistakes

Nobody is a nobody God doesn't make mistakes
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exist in grace
We all may fall (we all may fall) some may stall
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes
All in all God doesn't make mistakes
