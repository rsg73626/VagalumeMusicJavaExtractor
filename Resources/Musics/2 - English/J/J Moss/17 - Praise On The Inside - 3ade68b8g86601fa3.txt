PRAISE ON THE INSIDE

Hook: 

there's a praise on the inside that can't keep to myself 
there's a holler stirrin' up 
from the depths of my soul 
so excuse me if i seem a little giddy or maybe even strange 
but praise is the way i say thanks 

bridge: 

let it bring forth a sound from your voice filled with gladness 
all ye lands make a joyful noise 
and let the psalms of david live forever and ever 
praise is the way i say thanks
