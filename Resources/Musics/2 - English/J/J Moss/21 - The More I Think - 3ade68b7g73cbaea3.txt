THE MORE I THINK

From sickness and diseases
Depression beyond measure
You have kept me whole
The more I think 
The more I think I thank you 

Through hatred and anger
Through struggles and stumbles
You have made me strong
The more I think
The more I think I thank you 

Chorus
I thank you for your intervention
When I needed you to come and get me
For lifting the standard when evil arises
The more I think I thank you 

From muggers and rapists
Oppressors and racists
I am never left alone
The more I think 
The more I think I thank you've

From layoffs and demotions
Evictions and convictions
You have held me close
The more I think 
The more I think I thank you 

Special Chorus
Can't nobody do me like Jesus (x3)
Can't nobody do me like the Lord
