ALRIGHT OK

When I think of my life, my life I
I think of about all the good and the bad
When I think of every smile and cry I
Know somebody was looking out for me
When I think of every up and down I
Seen a lot of friends comin' to an end
Every high and low that hurt me
Look at me now and say

Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good and I won't complain even if I could
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good sunshine and rain working as it should
It's alright ok
I'm alright ok

When I think about days and nights I
I try to sort out the truth from a lie
When I think of every head and heart ache
Know somebody was looking out for me
When I think of how I needed answers
Called a lot of friends but they weren't in
Then I hear a voice not of reason
Say it's my season

Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good and I won't complain even if I could
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good sunshine and rain working as it should
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good and I won't complain even if I could
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good sunshine and rain working as it should

It's alright ok
I tell myself

Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good and I won't complain even if I could
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good sunshine and rain working as it should
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good and I won't complain even if I could
Everything is alright
Everything is ok
Everything is all good sunshine and rain working as it should
It's alright ok
I'm alright ok
