CAUGHT UP IN LOVE

You caught me in love)
you changed my life the day I said yes to you
You made a difference nobody else could seem to do
Nobody else could make me change all of my ways
And say the words that take pain away
Nobody else can do the things that help you prove
That my world could not exist without you

tell me how
How many times can you run away before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done
Tell me how
How many times can you smile all day
before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done (I was wrong)
You caught me (ayye)
You caught me (ayye)
You caught me in love

You make dreams out of impossible it seems
(anybody know what I'm talking 'bout)
You make my life flow with all amazing things
Nobody else has a name
That will break away the chains
And free me from all bondage (father)
Nobody else can take me further than a plane
To the place that bears no heartache

How many times can you run away before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done
How many times can you smile all day
before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done
(but I was wrong)
You caught me (ayye)
You caught me (ayye)
You caught me (ayye)
You caught me (ayye)
You caught me in love

How many times can you run away
Before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done
But I didn't know what I was missing
How many time can you smile all day
Before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done
How many times can you run away
Before you're caught in love
How many times can you smile all day
Before you're caught in love
I thought it couldn't be done
You caught me in love
