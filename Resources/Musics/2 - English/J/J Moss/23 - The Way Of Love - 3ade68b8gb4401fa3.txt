THE WAY OF LOVE

I was looking for love in all the wrong places 
And never found a cure 
I was hoping that it could be sent from Heaven 
A love so sweet and pure 
In all of my years I've seen many faces 
That dwindled by the way 
In all of my fears it left me lonely
With tears here to stay 
 
I learned the way of love
I learned to pray for love
If you see it in a lifetime
Learn to stay in love

I had fallen so deep in the depths of passion 
My heart about to drown 
Fulfilling my need to have a companion
But no one was around 
In all of my guilt I feel redemption
It wasn't all my fault 
The home that I built was real inside me
But love was never caught 
 
I learned the way of love
I learned to pray for love
If you see it in a lifetime
Learn to stay in love

If you feel like you'll never be one of them 
Who discovers a love for eternity 
Continue to be patient and keep you heart 
Safe from those who might tear it all apart 
And learn the way of love 

Mmmm... mmm...
Ooh ooh oooh oooh

(I learned the way of love) I learned the way-ay-ay of love
(I learned to pray for love) I learned to pray, I learned to pray for love
If you see it, hold it, grab it, keep it
(Learn to stay in love) Stay in love, stay in love

(I learned the way of love) Oh oh oh, I learned the way of love
(I learned to pray for love) when nothing else could help love lived in me
(If you see it in a lifetime) if you get a chance to see it
(Learn to stay in love) Don't let it go, don't let it go no, no, no

(I learned the way of love) I learned the way of love
(I learned to pray for love) I learned to pray for love
I know it may not come easy 
(Learn to stay in love)
