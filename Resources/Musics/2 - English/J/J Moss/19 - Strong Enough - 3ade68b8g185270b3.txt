STRONG ENOUGH

Lookin' at the walls - feelin' like they're closing in on me
Scared I might fall - krazy like trippin' over my own feet
What would I do if the lord took his arms from around me
I'd succumb to the grips of the unknown

But I know I'm not supposed to feel this way (God)
I know that I'm supposed to trust you everyday (God)
But it gets so hard to keep it all movin' (God)
Sometimes I feel like I'm loosin' my grip on God

I'm tired of living like my faith ain't strong enough
I'm tired of living like my faith ain't strong enough
I'm tired of living like I'm scared of what's coming around the corner
Tired of living weak when I know that I'm stronger
I'm tired of living like my faith ain't strong enough

I wanna spread my wings but I worry too much about what people think
Oh God will I flourish or will I sink
What I believe doesn't match up with what's bothering me
It's written in your word - you got my needs

But I know I'm not supposed to feel this way (God)
I know that I'm supposed to trust you everyday (God)
But it gets so hard to keep it all movin' (God)
Sometimes I feel like I'm loosin' my grip on God
