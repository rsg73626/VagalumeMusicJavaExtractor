TAKE ME

I dig into myself and I see hurt
I dig a little deeper and I see pain
I see myself as an average person
I dig into myself and I see the rain
I'm looking for a way to make it dissipate
I'm tired of crying and hope it doesn't worsen
Does He really care for me
Does He really know anything about me
Does He really hold the world in His hand
Is He too big that He doesn't understand
Is He too far away that He can't hear
What I need Him to hear and need Him to be near

Have I gone too far
Away from your presence
Oh my God I'm running back to you
Have I strayed away, too far to hear what you say
Oh my God I'm running back to you
Take me

Look deep into my eyes and I see tears
I do some soul searching and I see fear
I see myself as an injured person
I try to keep safe from the struggle and the storm
But try to find a way to make it move on
I don't want this discouragement to worsen
Does He really care about me
Does He really know anything about me
Does He really hold the world in His hand
Or is He too big that He doesn't understand
Is He too far away that He can't hear
When I need Him to hear or need Him to be near

Have I gone too far
Away from your presence
Oh my God I'm running back to you
Have I strayed away
Too far to hear what you say
Oh my God I'm coming back to you

Take me
Back into your arms
Take me
Safe from all harm
Take me
Away from dark shadows
Take me
Where you lead I'll follow
Take me
I can't do this on my own
Been gone too long
Take me in your arms and keep me warm
Take me
