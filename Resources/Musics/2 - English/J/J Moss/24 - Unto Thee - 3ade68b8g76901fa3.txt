UNTO THEE

Unto thee oh Lord, i dedicate my service unto thee oh Lord, in truth I give my worship 
behold the king, of glory, strong, and mighty 
I love to be in the presence of your majesty 
I lift my hands,I lift my voice unto the lord, 
I give my life I give my soul for my reward I submit my all Unto Thee 

Repeat Chorus 

I live to praise and please you oh god of all the heavens and earth the father who's so high and holy 
deep in my temple rest (oh) a heart that will never be persuaded not to serve you 

I lift my hands I lift my voice (ooh unto the lord oh oh) 
I give my life I give my soul (for my reward come on) 
I give my life and I give my soul 
for my rewards 
I submit it unto thee
