DON'T LET

CHORUS:
Don’t let it take your joy away- No
Hold on because it’s almost over
Don’t let it take your joy away- No
Heaven’s gonna answer your call
I know you’re hungry- Hold on
I know you’re praying- Hold on
And you’ve been crying- Hold on
But just make it ‘til the morning
Keep your mind stayed on God
Don’t let your joy be taken away
Lately you’ve been taking some trouble on
You’ve been praying but you feel like it’s taking long
You’ve planted your seeds now wait for your harvest
Believe that it’s on its way

Maybe you feel like you’re lost
Like a child who has wondered off
In the midst of your storm you will find your way
Don’t let your joy

CHORUS

VAMP
Don’t let it steal your joy
