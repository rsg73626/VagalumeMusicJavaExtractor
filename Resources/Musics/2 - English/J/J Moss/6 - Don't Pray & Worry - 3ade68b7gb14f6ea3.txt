DON'T PRAY & WORRY

Verse 1
He knows whats before you.
He will never neglect his nor will ignore tears in your eyes
Lay your cares to rest.

Chorus
The righteous won't be forsaken
Just hold to your faith
And His word will be manifested
Be steadfast and don't fear
Don't pray and worry

Verse 2
Why is it that we will spend time
Going to shurch but don't undersyand why
Why we must pray and then believe
Things that we pray for will soon be recieved
