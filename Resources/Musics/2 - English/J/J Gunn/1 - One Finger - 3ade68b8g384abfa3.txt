ONE FINGER

[verse 1]
(yo)
Mother Fuck the third day
Nah thats what they want me to say
But J Gunn is Thursday till im gone from this place
My songs will erase, all the nonsense yawll speakin
Comments is the reason, ive been pissed all season
Musta missed Judge preachin
Sermon review, take out ur prefection experiments
and turn to page two
You will here my squad speak about u haters and busters
Everday u discuss us only hate us becuz u love us
And its killin you, sittin there thinkin of rumours
J's Gay Slack Wack, Killa K is a looser
You cant move us, we makin careers of this
best songs best albums greatest lyricist
Ya fear is this, people will never hear ur shit
Cuz the, 3rd is the Word and ur clearly shit
be serious, u will never reach these degreese
cuz u cant make songs like these.....PERIOD

[chorus]
All you get is one finger
bet u no wich one it is
One finger, cuz u dont wanna let us live
Not the pinky, the ring, index or the thumb
one finger and it dont stand for number one
one finger
bet u no wich one it is
One finger, cuz u dont wanna let us live
Not the pinky, the ring, index or the thumb
one finger and it dont stand for number one

[verse 2]
Mother F*ck George Bush..
Exept i mean that forreal
You'll all feel me when america Collapse forreal
All cap no heel
sittin there smilin his as* off
While our children risk there lives
in this armorous task force
A crash course is what hes sending us on
Keep ur finger up to bush until the end of this song!
But i guess ill stop rappin about politics
Before the Black-Ball me and lock me out of this bizz
When i was a kid, i learned that this game was a scam
know one believes in what they say, they only say its a scan
I say im the man, Cuz sh*t God Dammit i am
J Gunn's a Tech 9, dawg im known to jam
But will shoot, somebody get me out of this booth
Cuz if im, Lien im dien, swear to god im the truth
Honestly Duke, this song is for all my enemies
So if my people feel me, holler fu*k THIS INDUSTRY

[chorus]
All you get is one finger
bet u no wich one it is
One finger, cuz u dont wanna let us live
Not the pinky, the ring, index or the thumb
one finger and it dont stand for number one
one finger
bet u no wich one it is
One finger, cuz u dont wanna let us live
Not the pinky, the ring, index or the thumb
one finger and it dont stand for number one
