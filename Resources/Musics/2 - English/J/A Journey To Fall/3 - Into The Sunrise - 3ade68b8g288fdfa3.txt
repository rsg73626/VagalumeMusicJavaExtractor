INTO THE SUNRISE

As soon as night falls,
We'll steal it together,
And we'll make it last until we're both gone.

And we'll fall asleep,
With better judgement,
Than they have given us,
So stay next to me and than we'll.

And we'll ride the wings,
Of this evening,
Into the sunrise.

As soon as night falls,

With better judgement,
Than they have given us,
So stay next to me and than we'll.

And we'll ride the wings,
Of this evening,
Into the sunrise.
