AMONG TIDES

I'd jump from these buildings,
If I could see your face again,
And I'd break down these walls for you,
If I could find you again.

It's been weeks since I heard your voice,
It's been months since I held your hand,
And now the taunts of others have brought me to shame.

But I've carried this in my heart,
You were all I had,
But I've carried this in my heart,
It's my last chance to find you.

They'll tell our stories forever,
(How could you fall away)
They'll tell our stories forever,
(How could this fall apart)

I am nothing without you,
I'm an empty box, a broken lock.
My hands are tied,
You were the perfect storm,
To bring the tides and wash it all away.

They'll tell our stories forever,
(How could you fall away)
They'll tell our stories forever,
(How could this fall apart)

They'll tell our stories forever [x5]
