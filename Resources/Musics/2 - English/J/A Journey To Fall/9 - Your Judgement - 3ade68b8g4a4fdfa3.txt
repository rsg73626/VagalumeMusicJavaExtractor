YOUR JUDGEMENT

Stand up, face the alter.
You can?t hold your grudges forever.
The jury has made their decision.
I?ll watch them bury you alive.

Step back, take a second.
You don?t know what this did to me.
They lied when they told you.
I?ll watch them bury you alive.

Bury you alive. [2x]
As nights grow colder our bodies grow older.
We can?t afford to turn away.
Now that this is over our days will end.

Our days will end.
They took us in when we had no ground to stand above.
They showed me life when I thought my death has begun.
I can?t imagine your face after I left.

I never wanted you to end this way.
As nights grow colder our bodies grow older.
We can?t afford to turn away.
Now that this is over our days will end.

Our days will end.
Never again will we break your trust.
When will you know?
I can?t turn away.

You?ll spend your life running from this.
As nights grow colder our bodies grow older.
We can?t afford to turn away.

Now that this is over our days will end.
Our days will end. [2x]
I can?t turn away.
You?ll spend your life running from this.
