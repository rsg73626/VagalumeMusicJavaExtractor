THE UNBROKEN PROMISE

...You're so far gone.
With the same song on the radio.
That takes you back to me.
It's a long road from here.
My way away from you.

Away from this run down town.
That's taken so much from me.
For the world to see.

[Chorus:]
This could've ended differently
(We could've been so much more)
We'll never be the same
(But you never needed this, I could've given you my heart)
I never wanted your
(With this Unbroken Promise)
Unbroken Promise

So tell me this was real
(So take my breath away)
Just so I can feel
(And leave me gasping here)
(I'll scream your name til' morning)
Anything but this
(Unbroken Promise)
Unbroken Promise

All that you've done to me.
You've called me out on every promise I could never keep.
But it's too late now.
(It's too late now)
I'mm falling deeper into my grave.
Don't think about it, don't talk about it.

Broken down
Out of time
You and I
Victims lying here

Broken down
Out of time
You and I
Victims lying here

[Chorus: x2]
This could've ended differently
(We could've been so much more)
We'll never be the same
(But you never needed this, I could've given you my heart)
I never wanted your
(With this Unbroken Promise)
Unbroken Promise

So tell me this was real
(So take my breath away)
Just so I can feel
(And leave me gasping here)
(I'll scream your name til' morning)
Anything but this
(Unbroken Promise)
Unbroken Promise
