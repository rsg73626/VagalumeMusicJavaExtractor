DEVASTATION AT ITS FINEST

I’ve been walking through this wasteland for days. But it feels like forever.
We both knew this would getter harder before it gets easier.
This what made us feel alive. Can we make it through tonight?
I’ll be damned if I’m the first to say goodbye.
Every kiss feels like the first time.
I’ll be damned if I’m the first to let this die.
Every touch feels like the first time.
This whole time I never knew this was a disaster unfolding.
This whole time I had thought we were safe.
Now I don’t know if we’ll make it out alive.
This is devastation, is this what you wanted?
I hope you feel alone, cause you asked for this.
I’m a sick man but you’re still sane.
I was the one you placed with the blame.
I’ll go to hell, you’ll go to heaven.
No one there would ever let me in.
You held the devil’s hand as you told me your lies.
I’ll be damned if I’m the first to say goodbye.
Every kiss feels like the first time.
I’ll be damned if I’m the first to let this die.
Every touch feels like the first time.
You held the devil’s hand as you told me your lies.
