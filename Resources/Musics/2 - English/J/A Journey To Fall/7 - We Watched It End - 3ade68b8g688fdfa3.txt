WE WATCHED IT END

Will you be free from the ones who hold your sin?
I know you?ve seen some darker days.
We?ll be home soon so don?t forget, so don?t you forget.
You always made me remember, I was always up close.

I have seen a demon, I have seen you.
I should have known that times were getting harder.
But we can still survive.
They draw us away but we hide.

There?s no room for mistakes, what?s left? [4x]
What?s left of us is not what they see.
They picture us different.
I should have known that times were getting harder.

But we can still survive.
They draw us away but we hide. [2x]
Here?s to the future, I live in dreams.
These fires burn away memories.

I see the shadows of those who fell.
I start to smile as I burn in hell.
No name, no face.
I?ve been on this chase for days.

I never mentioned what took place.
I turned away with shame a disgrace.
There?s no room for mistakes. [2x]
I should have known.
