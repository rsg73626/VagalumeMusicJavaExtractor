THIS ENDLESS CHASE

These are the last words I'll leave with you,
Don't hold on for too long,
This is the end of us both,
And you will always remember,
I took you for granted.

Your disease won't be cured,
I have seen worse things in my dreams.

But if we make it through,
I'll never look at you again,
Oh please don't let me down,
You'll never make me feel alive again,
This doesn't have to be the end,
We'll make it through again,
(We'll make it through again).

You said that this was over,
But I can't read between those lines,
How can you walk away like this,
I know what's behind your lies.

But if we make it through,
I'll never look at you again,
Oh please don't let me down,
You'll never make me feel alive again,
This doesn't have to be the end,
We'll make it through again,
(We'll make it through again).

I make this look good.

You said everything works,
But you've been broken,
It's always just running away.

You make me believe that it all was part of the plan,
I'm tired of of this endless chase.
