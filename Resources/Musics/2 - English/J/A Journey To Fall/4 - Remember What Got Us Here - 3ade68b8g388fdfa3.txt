REMEMBER WHAT GOT US HERE

Where were you when this was happening?
I hear them repeat over and over.
How could you let this happen?
They stare over me watching every step,
I fought for so long and now I can’t get ahead.
Something isn’t right. Something has gone wrong.
The sense of emptiness has drowned the room.
Did you know this is where it would end?
With all this talk of better times.
Why can’t we go back from here?
Remember.
None of this shows on their faces. We’re running again.
The water is shallow but the gates are deep.
Distributing power but losing strength.
Did you know this is where it would end?
With all this talk of better times.
Why can’t we go back from here?
Where the fuck were you when this was happening?
I hear them repeat over again.
How could you let this happen?
How could you let this happen?
My darling, how could you let this happen?
Did you know this is where it would end?
With all this talk of better times.
Something isn’t right.
Something has gone wrong.
The sense of emptiness has drowned the room. [2x]
