RISEN

Across the sky there is a flight
Where I need to be
You might get if you seek
It's like to be free
Above the clouds
Just feel and shout
As you never did

Even like a legend
Before the history
Never existed
Until someone write it
Therefore take it
And make by yourself
And don't let anyone else
Influence you

You can get you flight
Beside of us
Trying to reach the sky

Reach the line of horizon
Look at the shine
We don't have too much time
To bring the sun
When you get the chance
You're gonna be the one

This story isn't over yet
Cause it's not the end
Of the mistery
You're gonna fly away
Through reality
Show then that you can
Before they see

The beauty of this sky
This is not a lie
You can trust me
Across the sky there is a flight
Where I need to be
You might get if you seek

Reach the line of horizon
Look at the shine
We don't have too much time
To bring the sun
When you get the chance
You're gonna be the one
