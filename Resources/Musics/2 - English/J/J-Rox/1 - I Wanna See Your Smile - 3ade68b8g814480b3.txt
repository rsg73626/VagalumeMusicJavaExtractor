I WANNA SEE YOUR SMILE

You make me laugh, you make me cry
Please tell my words is not a lie
And I can't stay here forever
And when I look up to the sky
I always see your pretty smile
The stars shows me why sometimes I need to cry

I wanna be your sky
The fresh air when you breath
I wanna see your smile
And just stay by your side
I wanna see your smile
And never let you down
I wanna see your smile
I wanna see

May I believe? Was not a dream?
Cause I'm still feeling you in me
And I can't wait here forever
I do remember when you cried
And told me gentle pretty lies
I was blind I couldn't see you were leaving us behind
I wanna be your sky
The fresh air when you breath

I wanna see your smile
And just stay by your side
I wanna see your smile
And never let you down
I wanna see your smile
And just stay by your side
I wanna see your smile
And never let you down
I wanna see your smile
I wanna see
