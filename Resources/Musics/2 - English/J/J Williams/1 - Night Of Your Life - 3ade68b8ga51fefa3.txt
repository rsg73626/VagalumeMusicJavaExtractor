NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE

Get on the dance floor,
Music loud, wanting more,
Come and take it, come and take it all!
This beat is out of sight; blow your mind, dynamite,

You can make it!
You can make it!
Just get this party started,
You wanna move,

So let your body, body
Just feel the groove!
It's time to shift the gay,
Hands in the atmosphere,

Come live this life
It's gonna be out of sight!
This is the night of your life;
It's got you wanting more!
It's got you, you wanting more!

This is the night of your life,
It's got you wanting more,
It's got you move, you are wanting more!

[Chorus:]
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah you want more,
Oh, oh, oh!
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!

To the stars, I'm gonna take you to a special place,
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it, oh?
This is place is pumping,

Feel the rush of music through your veins!
It's try to fight, now!
You can't deny it, no!
Just get this party started,

You wanna move,
So let your body, body
Just feel the groove!
It's time to shift the gay,

Hands in the atmosphere,
Come live this life,
It's gonna be out of sight!
This is the night of your life;
It's got you wanting more!
It's got you, you wanting more!

This is the night of your life,
It's got you wanting more,
It's got you move, you are wanting more!

[Chorus:]
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah you want more,
Oh, oh, oh!
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!

Hey, hey, glad you could make it!
Looking to the night...

Up, up and never come down,
On an air balloon you can never go down.
But I leave the phone at home,
Cause you don't wanna know what's going on,

And you better bring your comfy heels,
Or even rock fresh, let the younger,..
So when it comes to brill it couldn't be any better,
The dance floor is soaked.

It couldn't get any better,
Don't worry about a taxi,
We could get a broom.
Don't worry about the sun,
Just focus on the moon!

This is the night of your life,
It's got you wanting more!
It's got you, you wanting more!

The time of your life!
The time of your life!

[Chorus:]

You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah you want more,
Oh, oh, oh!
You want more!
Oh, oh, oh!
