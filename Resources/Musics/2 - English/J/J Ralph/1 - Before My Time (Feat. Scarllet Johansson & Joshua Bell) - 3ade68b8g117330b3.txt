BEFORE MY TIME (FEAT. SCARLLET JOHANSSON & JOSHUA BELL)

Cold feet, don't fail me now
So much left to do
If I should run ten thousand miles home
Would you be there?
Just a taste of things to come
I still smile

But I don't want to die alone
I don't want to die alone
Way before my time

Keep calm and carry on
No worse for the wear

I don't want to die alone
I don't want to die alone
Way before my time

Is it any wonder
All this empty air
I'm drowning in the laughter
Way before my time has come
