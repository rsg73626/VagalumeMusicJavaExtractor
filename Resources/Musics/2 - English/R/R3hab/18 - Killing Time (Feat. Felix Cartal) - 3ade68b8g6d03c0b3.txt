KILLING TIME (FEAT. FELIX CARTAL)

Blindly, running in the dark
Am I shadow?
To those who've played the part
I know that I'm fine, yeah
I'm sure it's all good
Sometimes it feels like
I'll never get far

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time

Standing back against the wall
I was raised to, rise, not fall
I'm sure it's all good
I know that I'm fine
But it's hard when you want it all

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time

I wanna say
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw inn the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time

I wanna say, say, say
What's on my mind
Why would I play it safe?
Just draw in the lines
Or dream it all away
Through half shut eyes
Won't live a life just killing time
