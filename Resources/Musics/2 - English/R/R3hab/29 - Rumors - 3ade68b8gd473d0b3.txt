One line
I know that you said about it a hundred times

You got me all wrong
Don't you know who, you talking to?
You got me all wrong

They say you never gonna treat me right
I know that you're forever, it's only one night
One night

That talk about, talk about me too much
I know that your intentions are as bad as mine
So let's pretend forever, it's only one night
One night
