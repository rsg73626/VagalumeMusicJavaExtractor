BIG BANANA (FEAT. HAVANA BROWN, PROPHET )

DJ Havana Brown, you crazy?
Better answer the question now
Talk to me
Let's go

Thicker than a Magnum, ace of spades
Strong light, we can play charades
My pants keepin' these
Bananas, clips, shoot for days

Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
What?
That big fat..

I'm goin' out tonight
Got a gun, I don't want to fight
I'm a hot girl, I have a right
Heave a right, have a right
Kill a guy hard I'mma call you bruised
Feel dropped out and I'mma call you Cruise
Beat it up up up, pop the juice
Pop the juice, pop the juice

Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
If you want that, baby I got it
Gi-gi-gi-give me
Gi-gi-gi-give me
Gi-gi-gi-give me
That big fat..

If you shit don't matter black or white
Let me shake the uh then flip the light
Let â€˜em all bark, I love to bite
Love to bite, love to bite
Getting tipsy, ain't getting loose
I got the vibe, they got the juice
Beat it up up up, pop the juice
Pop the juice, pop the juice

Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana uh na-na-nana
Do you have a big banana?

If you want that, baby I got it
(Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
(Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
That big fat..

(Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
(Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
(Gi-gi-gi-give me) Let's go
That big fat..

Let's go go, she don't know
Underneath the belt and the Polo
Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
Automat black with the Rolls go

Let's go go, she don't know
Underneath the belt and the Polo
Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
Automat black with the Rolls go
