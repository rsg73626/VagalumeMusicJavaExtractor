REVOLUTION (FEAT. NERVO, UMMET OZCAN)

I got a love that keeps on fighting
And keeps on
I got a heart that keeps on trying
And keeps on
We got these plans that keeps involved
And keeps on
Even when I hopes is broken
We keep on

People, that's so much for us to prove
So keep on
So much for us to do

You and me
I said start a revolution
Just you and me
Start a revolution
Start a revolution

I got a love that keeps on fighting
And keeps on
I got a heart that keeps on trying
And keeps on
People, tell me what you're gonna do
So keep on, show me what you're gonna choose
'Cause we can start a revolution

You and me
I said start a revolution
Just you and me
Start a revolution

Just you and me

People
