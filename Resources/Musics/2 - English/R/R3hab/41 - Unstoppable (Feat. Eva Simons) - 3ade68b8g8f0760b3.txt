UNSTOPPABLE (FEAT. EVA SIMONS)

Found a way to elevate
Nowhere I belong
Fire in me radiate
I'm about to launch

I'm the dark before the dawn
I'm the light that switches on

Now I shine so bright
Can you see my light?
Gonna take it to the stars
Like a fire bolt fighting through it all
I'm unstoppable
Here we go

This is the night, I can feel it
It's in my sight, I can see it
This is the night, I can feel it
This is the night, I can feel it

This is the night, I can feel it
It's in my sight, I can see it
This is the night, I can feel it
This is the night, I can feel it

I'm getting closer to the end
Where it all begins
I throw my hands up in the air
Like a champion

I'm the dark before the dawn
I'm the light that switches on

Now I shine so bright
Can you see my light?
Gonna take it to the stars
Like a fire bolt fighting through it all
I'm unstoppable
Here we go

This is the night, I can feel it
It's in my sight, I can see it
This is the night, I can feel it
This is the night, I can feel it

This is the night, I can feel it
It's in my sight, I can see it
This is the night, I can feel it
This is the night, I can feel it

Now I shine so bright
Can you see my light?
Gonna take it to the stars
Like a fire bolt fighting through it all
I'm unstoppable
