TALKING TO YOU (FEAT. RYNN)

I feel a lot less angry then I did last year
But have I start wondering, lost all fear
Of the dark, of the dark
Can you tell me, when did you become my ghost?
'Cause you were just right here as you held me close
In your arms, in your arms

But I'm talking to you, you, you, you
I'm talking to you, you, you, you
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you

I just drive through the night with the memories
Down the same back streets while the songs plays
On repeat, on repeat
Now time has gone, most has haunted me
And you went on, I can't look in my eyes up
In the string, in the string

But I'm talking to you, you, you, you
I'm talking to you, you, you, you
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you, you, you, you
I'm talking to you
