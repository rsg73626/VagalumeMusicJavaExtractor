SOUNDWAVE (FEAT. TREVOR GUTHRIE)

Come around, come around make a wall of thunder
Be a spark in the dark, that tidal wave that's ignite
Build it up now, waiting for the drop is the wonder
Oh, what a sound, weighing down
All around on a beautiful sun

I need a soudwave, no slowing down
 sing woah, woah
Into the sunrays, no cooling down
 sing woah, woah
Let's just keep going on (oo oo oo oo oo oo)
Let's just keep goin?

No comin' down, comin? down, keep the innovations
Say hello to the crowd, our firebirds into the night
Turn it up now, sending only good vibrations
A whole wall of sound crushing down all around
What a beautiful life

I need a soudwave, no slowing down 
sing woah, woah
Into the sunrays, no cooling down
sing woah, woah
Let's just keep going on (oo oo oo oo oo oo)
Let's just keep goin?
