WE DO (FEAT. MIRANDA GLORY)

We ain't perfect but we're working on it
You got baggage, but I gotta have it
Ain't no you without of me
There ain't no such thing
It's never easy, I wouldn't want it to be
I got moodswings
but you're still rocking with me
You make me laugh when I get mad
and I can't stand it, no

We drive each other crazy
And that's how I like it, baby
Two broken hearts still beating, we need this
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
Do you remember summer?
We tried to escape the suburbs
But we couldn't leave your covers, or each other
'Cause ain't no one love like we do

Both got a past
but we're getting past them
Go grab a couple of duffels and your passport
We don't got a destination
Pick your place and let's just go

We drive each other crazy
And that's how I like it, baby
Two broken hearts still beating, we need this
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
Do you remember summer?
We tried to escape the suburbs
But we couldn't leave your covers, or each other
'Cause ain't no one love like we do

We drive each other crazy
And that's how I like it, baby
Two broken hearts still beating, we need this
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
