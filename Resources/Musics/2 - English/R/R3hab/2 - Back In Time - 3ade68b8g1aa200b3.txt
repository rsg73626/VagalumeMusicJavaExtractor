BACK IN TIME

Black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie
I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts
Black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K
And I wish the whole world would, ok
I'm trying to make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand? Understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker,
Culture, bury a border, record-breaker
Won't cha give credit where credit is due
Don't cha know that I don't give a number 2?
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future,
We have to go back in time

Baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby

Go, go...

I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future,
We have to go back in time

Baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby

Go, go...

Baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
