TROUBLE (FEAT. VÉRITÉ)

I know you love her, love her
But deep down under the covers, covers
Does she know that I am the other, other
Does she

Well it's not like I planned this, planned this
But you were so fucking romantic, romantic
Why you always like it so fancy, fancy
This ain't me
Just love me, love me, love me
love me when the lights go down
And hold me, hold me, hold me till it's dark
And maybe you can make me forgive myself
And leave me, leave me, leave me when it's done

'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Try to get into my head
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Play it over and over again

No I won't blow your cover, cover
I know it's not your fault that you love her, love her
And I'm betting that you will discover
I'm not someone you can try to keep

Well it's not like I planned this, planned this
But you were so fucking romantic, romantic
Why you always like it so fancy, fancy
This ain't me
Just love me, love me, love me
love me when the lights go down
And hold me, hold me, hold me till it's dark
And maybe you can make me forgive myself
And leave me, leave me, leave me when it's done

'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Try to get into my head
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Play it over and over again
