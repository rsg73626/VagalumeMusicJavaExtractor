READY FOR THE WEEKEND (FEAT. NERVO, AYAH MARAR)

Hold on, long week never ending
It's never ending
I keep looking for the light
At the end of the road, yeah

I've been working overtime
And now the weekend's on my mind
So if you're hearing me tonight
Then let me see you put em high

If you're ready for the weekend
You gotta let yourself go
If you're ready for the weekend, yeah
I'll take you places you don't know
Everybody, can you hear me?
You've gotta let your heart decide
If you're ready for the weekend, yeah
Then let me see your hands up high

Day in, day out is relentless
Can be relentless
Nobody's gonna help you work it out, no

So when this life can let you down
Pick yourself upon the ground
'Cause tonight we're going out
C'mon everybody now

If you're ready for the weekend
You gotta let yourself go
If you're ready for the weekend, yeah
I'll take you places you don't know
Everybody, can you hear me?
You've gotta let your heart decide
If you're ready for the weekend, yeah
Then let me see your hands up high

If you're ready for the weekend
Are you ready, are you ready?
Weekend
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready?
Weekend
Are you ready, are you ready?
