TROUBLEMAKER (BY TAIO CRUZ) (R3HAB REMIX)

I saw when you arrived
Looking like a super model
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you ride
Put that thing on full throttle
So get get get up on the saddle

I wanna see you move like they move in Jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner, she could be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin' to hide it
Girl you're a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker

I throw my hands up
If you believe in me now
I keep my hands up
And do it all for the now
I sing out

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha

Sexy lil' mama
It's really nice to meet you
Can I be in you classroom
And be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera
Will you be in my feature
Cuz we gon' do some things
Hope your dad ain't a preacher

I wanna see you move like they move in Jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner, she could be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin' to hide it
Girl you're a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker

I throw my hands up
If you believe in me now
I keep my hands up
And do it all for the now
I sing out

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha

I love the way you dance
Oh, it makes me crazy
I wanna see you move
So just let it go baby
I feel like we can do this
If you wanna go with it
Let's take it to the top
Pu-pu-push it to the limit
Take it to the top
Pu-pu-push it to the limit
To the limit, to the limit
To the limit, limit, limit

I throw my hands up
If you believe in me now
I keep my hands up
And do it all for the now
I sing out

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh-ah-ha
