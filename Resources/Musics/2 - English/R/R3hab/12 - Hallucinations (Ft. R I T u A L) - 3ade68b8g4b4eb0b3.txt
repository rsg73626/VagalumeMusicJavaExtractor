HALLUCINATIONS (FT. R I T U A L)

I can't fight this
got my eyes fixed on you
I've seen something new
Must be hallucination
In my mind I realize you're not true
Must be something we do?

We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations

I can't fight this
got my eyes fixed on you
I've seen something new
Must be hallucination
In my mind I realize you're not true
Must be something we do?

We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations

Swore I saw you coming over here
Happiness is just controlling fear

We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
We're just hallucinations
