GET UP (FEAT. CIARA)

You're so close to the wall
Too far from my heart
But I'm ready to come take you away
Make you my home
I don't care where you're from
I don't care where we are
As long as you give me your all

So baby get up
'Cause you locked down all your love
Baby get up
'Cause this feeling just ain't enough
All I want is all of you
And all of me are loving you
So you better get up
'Cause you locked down all your love

So you better get up
'Cause you locked down all your love
Baby get up
'Cause this feeling just ain't enough
All I want is all of you
And all of me are loving you
So you better get up
'Cause you locked down all your love

You better get up
You're so close to the wall
Too far from my heart

You better get up x3
'Cause you locked down all your love
You better get up
