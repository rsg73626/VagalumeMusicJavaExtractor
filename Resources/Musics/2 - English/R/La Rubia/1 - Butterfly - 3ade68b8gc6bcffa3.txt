BUTTERFLY

I have  colored wings
Flight to and fro,
People think I'm beautiful
And try to catch me.

I love butterflies,
They are very beautiful.
Every time I see one,
Each time it appears more deals.

Woaaaaa (2x)

Butterflies, butterflies,
Like to fly,
Butterflies, butterflies,
Beautiful in the air ...

I have colored wings,
Flight to and fro,
People think I'm beautiful
And try to catch me.

Butterflies are beautiful,
Who does not like them?
Do not you agree?
I love butterflies
