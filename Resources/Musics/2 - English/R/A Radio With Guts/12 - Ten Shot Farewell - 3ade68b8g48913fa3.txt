TEN SHOT FAREWELL

say my name again before you say goodbye
i want to kiss you
and hold you one more time
i wanted nothing more
than to keep you for all time
but now it's over
and i just want to die

i've got ten shots lined up
in such a perfect line
kiss them
and kiss you in dark spots
dark spots
dark spots
in my mind

i drink one for heaven
drink two for hell
i drink three for the road
i drink four
farewell

look at me
before i die and disappear
see the reflection
of yourself in my tears
i wanted nothing more
than to see you all the time
but now it's over
and i wish i was blind

i've got ten shots lined up
in such a tragic line
kiss them
and kiss you in soft spots
soft spots
soft spots
in my mind

i drink one for heaven
drink two for hell
i drink three for the road
i drink four
farewell

i drink one
i drink two
i drink three
i drink four
i drink five
i drink six
i drink seven
drink eight
i drink nine
i drink ten
you know my heart still beats for you

i can't stop drinking about you...
