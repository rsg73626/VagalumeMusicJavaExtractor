ROLLERCOASTER

terror and fun combined
a steady climb a swift decline
i lost my mind
i travel back in time
a magic ride you're mine
our locked lips kiss beneath the moon
listen can you hear the sound
the sound of sound is all around
i feel my guts up in my ears
if it didn't mean anything
then why do you act so weird around me
and why do i act like i'm running from you
there's tension inside your stare
were killing ourselves pretending nothing was there
i'm locked up
lips shut
turning blue
i cant talk and i cant sleep i cant do much of anything
i cant walk and i cant breath
up and down
up and down
up and down again
my life's a rollercoaster ride
earthbound for the holiday
