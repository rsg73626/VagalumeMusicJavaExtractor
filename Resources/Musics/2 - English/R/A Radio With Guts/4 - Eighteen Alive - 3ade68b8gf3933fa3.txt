EIGHTEEN ALIVE

na na na na
na na na na...

she smokes
as she speeds steel railroad tracks
the setting sun behind her back
she's living in poetry now
could she live long enough to
write it all down?
she's looking for a new hometown

blonde hair
blue eyes
eighteen
alive
blonde hair
blue eyes
eighteen
new life

na na na na...

she cries and her mascara bleeds
black streaks creep cheeks
towards gravity
she's not too fond of being alone
she chose the train
for it's romantic tone
her heart is searching for a home

with her
blonde hair
blue eyes
eighteen
alive
blonde hair
blue eyes
eighteen
surprise...

na na na na...

no
she had no way of ever knowing
that she'd finally meet
her one and only
a brown haired boy with hazel eyes
with love so big it can't fit inside
no
he seldom finishes his bashful sentences
when he's lost in those tremendous eyes
he seldom finishes his bashful sentences
when he's lost in those tremendous eyes

he makes her glad that she's alive
she makes him feel like he'll survive
with her
blonde hair
blue eyes
eighteen
alive
blonde hair
blue eyes
eighteen
you're mine...
etc...
