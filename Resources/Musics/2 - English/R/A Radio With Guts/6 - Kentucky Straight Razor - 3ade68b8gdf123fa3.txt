KENTUCKY STRAIGHT RAZOR

I'm smoking way too many Turkish jades
And sipping on Kentucky straight
And when it's empty
I'll drink aftershave in desperation

When I was younger I was just abused
That's why I'm always staring at my shoes
It's funny how the smallest things affect you in big ways
Why do the best things always go so wrong?
It's not enough for them to give your all
A revelation in the shower stall that love is futile

Down the drain through the sewer pipes
The remnants of a fucked up life
I kissed her once but fucked her twice
I'm like a beast but not as nice

And all the time I wasted on some girls
Just makes me want to wretch
My guys unfurled
The road to hell is paved with golden curls and headaches
I've known the tragedy of former friends
I've seen the desperate means to desperate ends
I'm going to die by liver, lung or chest or by my own hand
I had a relative who killed himself
He made his noose from his karate belt
I think I know how he must have felt
But I'm still breathing

Down the drain through the sewer pipes
The remnants of a fucked up life
I kissed her once but fucked her twice
Revenge is sweetest served on ice, yeah

Down the drain through the sewer pipes
The remnants of a fucked up life
I kissed her once but fucked her twice
The phone is off the hook tonight

There's going to be a suicide tonight
You never know, this time it might be mine
There's going to be a suicide tonight
Hopefully, this time it won't be friends of mine
Yeah, there's going to be a suicide tonight
A razorblade is bought to bleed some xxxxxxxxxxxx dry
Yeah, there's going to be a suicide tonight
Another girl will stop the heart of just another guy
