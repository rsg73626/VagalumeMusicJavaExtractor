BLOODLETTER

You can't conceal the fire flaming from your eyes
It burns through your docile disguise
I've got these scraped-up knees
These gaping wounds
You're salting me tonight
I'm reaching for the knife

I don't want to write this song to wrong you
But you have me these feelings so they don't belong to me
I don't want to fight unless I have to
You've had me bleeding all night because I have to have you

I think of fingernails, first fucks, my back was carved
You left me sliced, shattered and scarred
Your beauty like a boulder breaking bones and cracking skulls with smiles
I'll bleed 'til I run dry

I don't want to write this song to wrong you
But you have me these feelings so they don't belong to me
I don't want to fight unless I have to
You've had me bleeding all night because I have to have you

I think I've heard the hurt that's hidden in your heart
I know why you've put up your guard
I've got these freezing hands, these empty arms, I'll be god damned tonight
I'm not al' xxxxxxx 'right

I don't want to write this song to wrong you
But you have me these feelings so they don't belong to me
I don't want to fight unless I have to
You've had me bleeding all night because I have to have you
