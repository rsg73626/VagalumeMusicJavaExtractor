MATH AND THE MOCKING MOON

Smoke invades these blackened lungs and exits my esophagus,
I've got a bottle in my hand.
Half full, half empty, it's still just half
Me minus you, such tragic math...

I'm drunk under the mocking moon and wonder if you are drinking too, and if the blackness in the skies envelopes you.
I look up at the mocking moon and wonder if you're looking too and if the same starlight that I see falls on you, falls on you.

Replay my thoughts of things we've done, I'm glad that I don't own a gun,
I've got your picture in my hand
Half sad, half angry, I'm still just half
Hearts broken in two, such simple math...

I'm drunk under the mocking moon and wonder if you are drinking too, and if the blackeness in the skies envelopes you.
I look up at the mocking moon and wonder if you are looking too and if the same starlight that I see kisses you.

I'm drunk under the mocking moon and wonder if you are drinking too and if the blackeness in the skies envelopes you.
I'm drunk under the mocking moon and wonder just who's xxxxxxx you and does he kiss you half as good as I miss you... I miss you, I miss you, I miss you,
I miss you.
