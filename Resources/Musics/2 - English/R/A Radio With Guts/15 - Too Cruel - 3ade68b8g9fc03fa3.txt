TOO CRUEL

i was there and you were, too
i was like a stupid kid in sunday school
i hated where i was i didn't want to go back
and then i heard your voice say relax

because i was too cruel
as you were too cruel too
and i was bleeding on the ground
and you were nowhere to be found

i was there and you were too
we were making lots of waves in the swimming pool
we were baking in the sun
naked flat on our backs
and then you cut me up with your axe

you were in my underwear
and i was really unaware
of how you really felt inside
and then i spoke the words that made you cry

i was there and you were too
i was lying next to you and then i started to drool
i dont mean it but i treat you like a piece of meat
