CAPTURED

My brain it used to hold these memories
They've faded fast away
Surprised i can still recall my name
Forgotten places and distorted blurry faces
Such a shame
Shame shame shame
This camera captures only images
Light on paper bound to fade
Sweet snapshots cant replace
The things that time erased

What must i do to capture you

My brain still haunts me with your memory
A million miles away
Do you remember everything
Regrets and praises and some awkward conversations
Cant find the phrase
My pen cant find your face
This ink it captures simple paragraphs
Light on paper bound to fade
Sweet sad sounds cant replace
The things we shared those days
