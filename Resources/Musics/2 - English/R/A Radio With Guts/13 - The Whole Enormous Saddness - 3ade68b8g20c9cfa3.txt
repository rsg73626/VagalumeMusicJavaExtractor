THE WHOLE ENORMOUS SADDNESS

there was frost in my hair
there was fire in your stare
and the air was so sharp
i grew an inch in a day
we were so far away as we played on the dock

there was ice on the waves
there was sun on your face though the day was so cold
you said your life wasn't yours
you said you couldn't afford the thought of being alone

we danced too close to the edge
we knew we both couldn't swim then you tripped and fell in
i reached my hand out to you
you were sinking times two nothing that i could do
i watched the last bubble rise
i saw your last breath of life dissipate out of site

and when i go to bed at night i wear the shirt you died in
and in my dreams we're swimming hand in hand in warm blue water
