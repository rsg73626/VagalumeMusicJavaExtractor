BLEEDING NOW

she says no to me when i say i love her
she says no to me
no to me
but she gets shivers every time i touch her
she gets shivers
the girl gets shivers
don`t look my eyes are bleeding now

she smoke menthols
burns them down like churches
she smokes menthols
newport menthols
she blows smoke at me like her guts are burning
she blows smoke at me
she blows smoke at me
don`t look my eyes are bleeding now...

she has nightmares i look like Mark Enoch
she has nightmares
she has nightmares
she says to me she don`t feel like fucking
she
she says to me
yeah, she says it
don`t look my eyes are bleeding now...
