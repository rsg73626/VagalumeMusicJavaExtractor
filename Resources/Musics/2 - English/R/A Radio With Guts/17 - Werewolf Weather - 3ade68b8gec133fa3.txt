WEREWOLF WEATHER

full moon wednesday
we walk in werewolf weather
come close to me
we'll slay this beast together
i'm gonna love you till i die
so if i ever start monsterfying
if you catch me metamorphosizing
or if you just get sick and tired of trying
just kill me...

i'm terrified
of all the things i could do
gouge out my eyes
if they don't always tell you
i'm gonna love you till i die
so if i ever start monsterfying
if you catch me metamorphosizing
or if you just get sick and tired of trying
just kill me...

just make it look like an accident
make sure it's painless
and make it quick
shoot out my brains
i'll write the note
stuff me with pills
until i choke on my own puke
till i'm passed out
you'll find my heart inside my mouth
