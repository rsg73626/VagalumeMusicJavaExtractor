PINK INK

smoke rings rise
into the atmosphere
bloodshot eyes
you're far away from here
sad phone call
you told me your big fear
my tears fall
like crashing chandeliers

pink ink
my heart sinks
you're such a sweet sweet thing
pink ink
i'm reading
the words that you wrote to me
in pink ink

pink
pink
pink pink pink pink
pink pink pink pink
pink

the next day
i got a note from you
i must say, you really surprised me too
you wrote things
exposing parts of you
in pink ink
parts of the heart of you

pink ink
my heart sings
you're such a sweet sweet thing
pink ink
i'm reading
the words that you wrote to me
in pink ink
pink ink
my heart stings
you're such a sweet sweet thing
pink ink
i'm reading
the words that you wrote to me
in pink ink
