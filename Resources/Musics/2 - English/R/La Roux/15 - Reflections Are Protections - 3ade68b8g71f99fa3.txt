REFLECTIONS ARE PROTECTIONS

Please
Please be my light-filter
Shine, make me a shelter
To hide, 'cause love makes you lose your sight.
And now the search party's on its way
And the floodlights on my face
All the shadows that I walk in
Arch my volatile second skin

My reflections are protection
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready, come into the light.

Lines
Design a pathway
Shine, cut out the dark shapes
To find
Although I really tried
Only time is a lover's guide
And now the railings fall away
And the stencils draw a face
Our outlines in the sunset
Are just a fragile silhouette

My reflections are protection
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready, come into the light.

My reflections are protection
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
If you leave me, I'll go back to hide.
