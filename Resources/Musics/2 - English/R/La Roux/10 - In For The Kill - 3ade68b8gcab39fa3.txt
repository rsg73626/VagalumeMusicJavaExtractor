IN FOR THE KILL

We can fight our desires
Ooooh but when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Ooooh whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
Oooh but what are feelings without emotions?
 
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
 (x2)
 
I hang my hopes out on the line
Oooh will they be ready for you in time?
If you leave them out too long
Oooh they'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks
Ooh my words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions?
Can this bridge cross the ocean?
 
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
(x2)
 
Let's go to war
To make peace
Let's be cold
To create heat
I hope in darkness
We can see
And you're not blinded
By the light from me
 
Oooooh oooooh oooooh oooooh ooooooooooh
 
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
