QUICKSAND

Ooo-ooo-ooo

I'm the obsessor 
Holdin' your hand
It seems you have forgotten 
About your man
Alone in the darkness
My bed's a different land
Your touch intensifies
And I'm in the quicksand 

I'm in the quicksand 
I'm in the quicksand 

You're the upsettor 
Stroking my hand
What's my position? 
I don't understand
Am I your possession?
Am I in demand?
Oh when you turn to me
I'm in the quicksand

I'm in the quicksand 
I'm in the quicksand 

You, you moved into my mind again oh
You, walking around and free oh
Oh I could let you stay
But I'm walking on broken ground again
Oh, oh when will I learn? 
All you do is push me back in the dark

oo-oo-oo-oo
