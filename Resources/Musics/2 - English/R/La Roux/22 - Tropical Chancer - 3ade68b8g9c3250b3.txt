TROPICAL CHANCER

Can't take the money, and the food that's on my hand
But you have to understand that he's a dreamer
Living and laughing in a mind you can't believe
This place turns honest men into thieves
And I can see it in bizarre
It is that time
To sail out from the night

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer

He'll trade your loving for the things he's never seen
The place he's never been
Above the member he is just a good pretender
And he doesn't give his love away for free
And I can see it in bizarre
It is that time
To sail out from the night

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
