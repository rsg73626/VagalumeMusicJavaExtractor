SEXOTEQUE

He wants to know what it feels like
To mess around, mess around
She wants to know what it feels like
To settle down, settle down

He's got the money but no, it's not enough
He wants to pounce, he wants to pounce
Never knowing if he's given you up
Or you're just not good enough

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, but money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexoteque
He never answers the phone
Oh, but money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexoteque

He wants to go where the red lights
Shine so bright, shine so bright
He wants to know why it feels so
Cold inside, cold inside

He turns and looks around, he doesn't hear a sound
No one's around, no one's around
Never knowing if he's given you up
Or you're just not good enough

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, but money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexoteque
He never answers the phone
Oh, but money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexoteque
