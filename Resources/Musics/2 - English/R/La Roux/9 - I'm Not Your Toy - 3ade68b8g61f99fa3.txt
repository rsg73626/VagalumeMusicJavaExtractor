I'M NOT YOUR TOY

Your love is like a stubborn youth
That you'd rather just deny
I'm walking on a broken roof
But I'm looking at the sky.

It's all false love and affection,
You don't want me, you just like the attention
Yes, it's all false love and affection,
You don't like me, you just want the attention.

I'm not your toy; this isn't another girl-meets-boy
I'm not your toy; this isn't another girl-meets-boy.

Your love hides in a smoky night,
I can never find the truth
Boy, your touches leave me mystified
I wish I could believe in you.

It's all false love and affection,
You don't want me, you just like the attention
Yes, it's all false love and affection,
You don't like me, you just want the attention.

I'm not your toy; this isn't another girl-meets-boy
I'm not your toy; this isn't another girl-meets-boy.
