FASCINATION

It's been seven hours long
And your shadow still hangs on
You've been two weeks gone
And so tonight I followed you home

There are so many different ways
Of collecting all the strays
The ones that get away

Old fascinations we crave
New sensations
Old fascination
It's feeding my frustrations
It's feeding my frustrations
And I haven't got the patience

These sheets are still warm
This bed is our only home
We make arrangements over the phone
Where has all the conversation gone

There are so many different ways
Of collecting all the strays
The ones that get away

Old fascinations we crave
New sensations
Old fascination
It's feeding my frustrations
It's feeding my frustrations
And I haven't got the patience

Frustrations
Sensations
Fascinations
Fascinations

Frustrations
Sensations
Fascinations
Fascinations

Old fascination
New sensations
Old fascinations
New sensations
Old fascinations we crave
New sensations
Old fascination
It's feeding my frustrations
