AS IF BY MAGIC

Emerging from my world
Imagine living in a box
And I won't come out
Until I've broken all the locks
 
Slurring all my words
Until something sticks
But in this smoky universe 
My mind keeps playing tricks
 
And although
You're the only home I know
As if by Magic
Thoughts of you are gone
And now I'm keeping my head in the clouds
And it's not so tragic
If I don't look down
 
Submerging from your world
And back into my bliss 
A day rolled into one
Is burning on my lips
Blurring all your words
Until they don't exist
And in a parallel universe
It's me you can't resist
And although
You're the only home I'll ever know
As if by Magic
Thoughts of you are gone
And now I'm keeping my head in the clouds
And it's not so tragic
If I don't look down
 
You say I"M a rose tinted lover come on
You know I'll never love another 
I won't stay a lonely lover for long
