ARMOUR LOVE

You PULL on your Armour
AND put up defences
Why do you want to?
Because I'm here to protect you

So take it easy
I'll make it so easy
You can lay your head down
And we'll leave it til tomorrow

You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world
You know that I'm in hell
When you know what it's like
To be lonely and by yourself

When your life is tangled
You wear your disguises
But why do you need to
When I'm standing here beside you?

So take it easy
I'll make it so easy
You can lay your head down
And we'll leave it til tomorrow

You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world
You know that I'm in hell
When you know what it's like
To be lonely and by yourself

Slipping through my fingers
AND INTO another's
Tell me why won't you turn back?

You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
(You know what it's like you shouldn't have to be told)
When you leave me alone in this world
You know that I'm in hell
(It's hard enough when you're alone in the world)
When you know what it's like
To be lonely and by yourself [2x]
