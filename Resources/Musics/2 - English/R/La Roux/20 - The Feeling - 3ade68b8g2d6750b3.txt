THE FEELING

Takin' the time to make me feel right
Takin' the time to make me feel nice
Can't stay up thinkin' about you all night
Tossin' and turnin', it's not right
Don't leave me here waiting

When it's all okay, we know, you know
And I know, I've got the feelin'
When I wake up and there you are
I get the feelin'
For you are away waiting the ball
'Cause I've got the feelin'
The feelin'
I get the feelin'

There's plenty of time to get me in shape
I promise I'll keep the promises I made
And respect along the forest, say goodbye
Running away, and it's swing to comeback
When you love it makes me love too
I can't believe I let you get through
Get through, get through

When it's all okay, we know, you know
And I know, I've got the feelin'
When I wake up and there you are
I get the feelin'
For you are away waiting the ball
'Cause I've got the feelin'
The feelin'
I get the feelin'

On the outside I might seem strong
But really, inside, I'm just alone
I don't believe wherever we go
I'm just a child whenever you show

On the outside I might seem strong
But really, inside, I'm just alone
I don't believe wherever we go
I'm just a child whenever you show
