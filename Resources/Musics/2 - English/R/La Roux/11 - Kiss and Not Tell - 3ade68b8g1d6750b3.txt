KISS AND NOT TELL

Ten thousand stories and two lovers disguised
You've seen the future, now a love that is blind
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You've dialed that number now, so where's the surprise?
Temptation's callin' you, a secret reply
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

All along the path, feelings I can't tell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell

You say in evidence, they won't take you alive
But when the sun goes down you can't realize
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You've got the elegance but it's weighin' you down
And sometimes you just need a night on the town
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

All along the path, feelings I can't tell
Makes me want to kiss and not
And all I want is to come right out my shell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell
