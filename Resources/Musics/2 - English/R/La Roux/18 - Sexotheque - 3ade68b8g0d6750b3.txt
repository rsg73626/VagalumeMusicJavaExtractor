SEXOTHEQUE

He wants to know
What it feels like to mess around, mess around
She wants to know
What it feels like to settle down, settle down
He's got the money but, no it's not enough
He wants to pounce, he wants to pounce
Never knowing if he's given you up
Or if you're just not good enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh (x2)

]
She wants to know why he's not home
All that money, money, money on him
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
All the money, money, money on him
He's at the Sexotheque

He wants to go
Where the red light shines so bright, shines so bright
He wants to know
Why he feels so cold inside, cold inside
He turns her picture round, he doesn't hear a sound
No ones around, no ones around
Never knowing if he's given you up
Or if you're just not good enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh (x2)

He's at the Sexotheque
