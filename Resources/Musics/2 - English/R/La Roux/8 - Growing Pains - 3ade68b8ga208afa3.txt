GROWING PAINS

My heart it melts like plastic
I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate

O I make mistakes
And you just say its growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me its just growing pains

We broke in two like a matchstick
It burns in my soul every day
Every day
Your world was to me so fantastic 
And hell seemed so far away
Far away

O I've made mistakes
And you just say its growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me its just growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
You tell me its just growing pains
And O I've made mistakes
And yes I know its growing pains

The truth it feels like concrete
I drove into its walls yesterday
I wish I could be realistic
But like children 
My dreams run away

I know I've made mistakes
You say its growing pains
And when I feel ashamed 
You say its growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
You say its growing pains
I know I made mistakes
And I know its growing pains

O I've made mistakes
And you just say its growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me its just growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
And O I've made mistakes
And yes I know its growing pains
