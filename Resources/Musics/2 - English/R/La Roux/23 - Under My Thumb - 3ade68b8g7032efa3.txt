UNDER MY THUMB

Under my thumb
A girl who has just changed her ways
It's down to me, me
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Under my thumb
A siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb
She's the sweetest, hmm, pet in the world

It's down to me, me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

It's down to me, me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I
I can still take a look at someone else

It's down to me, me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
