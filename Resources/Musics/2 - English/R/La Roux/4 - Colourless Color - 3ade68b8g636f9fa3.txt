COLOURLESS COLOR

You say it's coming
But I can't see it at all
You know me well
But I don't know you at all
No I don't know you at all

It's always just on the horizon
So my hopes rise and fall
You know me well
But I don't know you at all
No I don't know you at all

Early nineties décor
It was a day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless Colour
Once in fashion
And soon to be seen
[2x]

Been dreaming of blue skies
New horizons and sights for my eyes
The discovery of the unknown..
is something to tell the folks back home
I want to get away
To feel the sun on my skin
To feel it really sinking in

Early nineties décor
It was a day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless Colour
Once in fashion
And soon to be seen
[3x]

Early nineties décor
It was a day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless Colour
and soon to be rediscovered
