SAVIOUR

In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here

I hear you call me from the other room
You say my name as if you know what you?re about to do
You say you?re tired and you must be leaving soon
When will we ever see this through?
And I continue to drown my sorrows after you are gone
And look around for somebody else to hang my hopes on
In fact it?s easier now that you?re not here
I?m no longer missing you muttering those words in my ear

In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here

I can?t explain the dark expression on my face to the people that I?m surrounded by
You, but you understand me more than most and you let me try

In fact it?s easy now
In fact it?s easy now
In fact it?s easy now
In fact it?s easy now

I?m no longer dreading you muttering those words in my ear

In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here
