LET ME DOWN GENTLY

Let me down gently
That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
That's what I really need
Tell me that I'm someone good
So we're not so far apart, apart
I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young, foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

Set me up slowly
That's what you do to me
Oh you set me up slowly
Now I can't come down, down
Let you down gently
That's what I think you need
But when I let you down, you're empty
And you try to hide your frowns, frowns
I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young, foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

And I hope it's sinking in
Let behind your perfect skin
There's a part of you that's free
And I know that there's a place for me

Let me down gently
That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
That's what I really need
Tell me that I'm someone good
So we're not so far apart, apart

I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young, foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

And I hope its sinking in
And let behind your perfect skin
There's a part of you that's free
And I know that there's a place for me
