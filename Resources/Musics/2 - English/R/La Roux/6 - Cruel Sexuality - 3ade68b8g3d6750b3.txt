CRUEL SEXUALITY

I've been talkin' to myself
Oh, I think I need your help
Oh, this love is make-believe
Trapped inside a fantasy
And he came runnin' out of the water
In the dead of the night, he could see
And his shadow came before her
She fell, but she wanted to see
She whispered "Use me"

When we choose to deceive
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed

Cruel sexuality
Am I a fool, to let you travel me?
Cruel sexuality

I don't even know myself
Cause I'm becomin' someone else
Where is rationality?
When I'm locked inside a dream
I say, "Just use me"

When we choose to deceive
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed

Cruel sexuality
Am I a fool, to let you travel me?
Cruel sexuality

Oh, you make me happy in my every day life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my every day life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me?
Oh, you make me happy in my every day life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my every day life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me?
