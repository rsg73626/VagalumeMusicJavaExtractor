DO IT AGAIN

There you are standing with all your friends
So I'll wait till you're alone again
And the minutes feel like eternity

All these words buried inside my heart
Every step feels like the hardest part
But the last six feet are gonna kill me

So just take this chance
I've got it all planed

I'll pick you up at eight and we can drive around
Take you the beach and we can head downtown
While you hold my hand
We'll park and lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars
Tonight I'll be your man
And tomorrow we can do it again

(Tomorrow we can do it again)

If I could give you the world tonight
Then I would and still give you all my time
And I'd be rich 'cause love is everything

So just take this chance
I've got it all planed

I'll pick you up at eight and we can drive around
Take you the beach and we can head downtown
While you hold my hand
We'll park and lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars
Tonight I'll be your man
And tomorrow we can do it again

Let's take this moment
It's ours to own it
So come with me don't let it go to waste
No you don't wanna
M-miss out on us
I'm telling you regrets don't fade away

I'll pick you up at eight and we can drive around
Take you the beach and we can head downtown
While you hold my hand

We'll park and lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars
Tonight I'll be your man
And tomorrow we can do it again

I'll pick you up at eight and we can drive around
Take you the beach and we can head downtown
We'll park and lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars
Tonight I'll be your man
(I'll pick you up at eight, pick you up at eight)
And give you all I can (I'll pick you up at eight)
And tomorrow we can do it again
