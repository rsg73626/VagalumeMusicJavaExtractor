NEVER BE THE SAME

You don't need no money, money
Start a fire just get rowdy, rowdy
C'mon baby, d-d-don't ignore it
Natural like bees and honey
Don't keep me waiting for it

You're trying for more
But dancing in the friend zone
Baby, I'm bored
This game is so Nintendo
Kick in the door
Break in through the window
It's time to go

You're the one, the one I want
So shut your mouth, and turn it on
Don't complicate it, donate it
Right now at this moment things
Will never be the same (yeah)
I need something, something more
So whatcha, whatcha waiting for?
This conversation's overrated
Right now at this moment things
Will never be the same (yeah)

You only get one life so live it, live it
You know I want it now so give it, give it
We all regret the didn'ts not the did's
And I can't wait another minute
Get wild a little bit

You're trying for more
But dancing in the friend zone
Baby, I'm bored
This game is so Nintendo
Kick in the door
Break in through the window
It's time to go

You're the one, the one I want
So shut your mouth, and turn it on
Don't complicate it, donate it
Right now at this moment things
Will never be the same (yeah)
I need something, something more
So whatcha, whatcha waiting for?
This conversation's overrated
Right now at this moment things
Will never be the same (yeah)

Let's burn this bridge (what, what?)
Let's burn this bridge (what, what?)
Let's burn this bridge (What, what?)
Tonight is it
Regret the didn'ts not the did's
Let's make fire, pass the camera scene
I'll get mine, before they bury me
Have your cake, Eat a celery
Let's go hard, And wake up early
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Kick in the door
I want a little more
We gonna do it like we never did before

You're the one, the one I want
So shut your mouth, and turn it on
Don't complicate it, donate it
Right now at this moment things
Will never be the same (yeah)
I need something, something more
So whatcha, whatcha waiting for?
This conversation's overrated
Right now at this moment things
Will never be the same (yeah)
