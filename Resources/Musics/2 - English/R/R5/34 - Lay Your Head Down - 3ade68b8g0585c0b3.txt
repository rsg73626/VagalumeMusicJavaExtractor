LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN

Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, I know

Head down
So your height
A drug for my eyes
I've been needing something, needing something
Maybe a little too much

Slow down in your time
No, you don't need to rush
I've been drinking some, been drinking some
Maybe a little to much

'cause all my days seemed like
they were getting so long
The day that I couldn't take it much longer baby

Oh baby
So tell me baby do you feel like I do
Are you craving
Someone to hold you
As the sun comes up
And sets the stars

Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah I know
Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah I know

Face found
Calvin klein
A bank dont need love

I've been dreaming some, have you been dreaming some
Maybe a little to much
Slow down to a mile
The rum is diet blue
You've been drinking some, been drinking some
Maybe a little too much

The things you say
Been keeping me high
My apothecary
Give me the stories to go
But baby

Oh baby
So tell me baby if you're feeling
the love that I feel
And lately
Nowhere I'd rather be
As the sun comes up
And sets the stars

Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah I know
Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah I know

'cause all my days seemed like they were getting so long
The day that I couldn't take it much longer baby
Oh baby

Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah I know
Lay your head down with me darling
Pick your heart up of the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah I know
