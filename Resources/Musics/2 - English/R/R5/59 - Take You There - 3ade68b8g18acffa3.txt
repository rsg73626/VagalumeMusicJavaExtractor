TAKE YOU THERE

I'm the type of guy that likes to stay out,
There's something special dancing all night
Rocking on yeah, that's what we're all about,
You looking good, I'm feeling alright
The world's a space

Look at all the beauty you see,
I'm right here where you want me
I'll take you to a place,
Best thing that has even been seen,
C'mon baby take a chance with me

Ohh whoa, I can take you there,
Ohh whoa, baby, we can roam afar
Ohh whoa, ah, ah, oooh
Ohh whoa, ah, ah, oooh

You're the type of girl that likes to run wild,
I'd like to take you, let's go tonight
Uh

I'm looking at you, such a sight
Take you for a ride,
There is something

We're getting closer, trust in me

Oh please follow, it's just you and me,
It's a whole new world for you to see
