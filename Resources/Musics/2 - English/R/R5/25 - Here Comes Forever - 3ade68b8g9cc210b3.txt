HERE COMES FOREVER

I'm like that boom box outside of your window
I'm that De Lorean blowing past 88
And where we're going girl,
Won't be needing roads 'cause,
Oo oo oo oo
This ain't no 50 first dates.

I'm talking 'bout starting out as friends
I'm talking 'bout real and not pretend
I'm talking 'bout roles of a life time
You and I can even write the end
Yeaaaaah

Here comes that movie scene
One you hate so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake, pouring rain
I ain't no superman
But I can change your world
Ooooooo
Here comes forever, girl
Ooooooo
Here comes forever
Ooooooo
Here comes forever, girl

This ain't no remake of a Romeo story
Ain't no werewolf trying to steal you away
I'll be your a-list, be the man on the moon 'cause
Oo oo oo oo
Me and you outta space

I'm talking 'bout starting out as friends
I'm talking 'bout real and not pretend
I'm talking 'bout roles of a life time
You and I can even write the end
Yeaaaaah

Here comes that movie scene
One you hate so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake, pouring rain
I ain't no superman
But I can change your world
Ooooooo
Here comes forever, girl

Na Na Na Na Na Na [7x]

Let's go home together
Play our roles forever
Let's grow old together
Here comes
Here comes
Here comes forever, baby...

Here comes forever, girl

Here comes that movie scene
One you hate so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake, pouring rain
I ain't no superman
But I can change your world
Oo oo oo oo
Here comes forever, girl
Oo oo oo oo
Here comes forever
Oo oo oo oo
Here comes forever, girl
(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
Here comes forever, girl
