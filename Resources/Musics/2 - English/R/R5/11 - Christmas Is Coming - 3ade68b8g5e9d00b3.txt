CHRISTMAS IS COMING

Oh oh christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side

Santa, is coming to town
And you're not gonna be around
This snow, is bringing me down
'Cause tomorrow's gonna be a big day
And you're worlds away

I'd give anything
If we'd could sing
Fa la la la La la la la la la la

Oh oh christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side
This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time

Presents, under the tree
Could never mean as much to me
As you here
hat's why I believe
That when I see Santa's sleigh
Heading this way

He's gonna hear my wishes
And know I miss ya
Fa la la la La la la la la la la

Oh oh christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side
This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time

If we could all be together
In crazy Christmas sweaters
I know that Santa hears me
Loud and clear
Don't ya hear me now

Oh oh christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side
This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time (x2)

Oh o woah
Oh o whoah oh
That's what makes it, makes it Christmas time
