LIGHTNING STRIKES

There ain't no way that I could ever forget you
I can't remember why I ever went and left you

Maybe I was hitting my head
Maybe must've been something that I said
Baby I want to take it back tonight

Oh oh oh oh x2
You don't have to tell me twice
When lightning strikes

Oh oh oh oh x2
You don't have to tell me twice
When lightning strikes

So obvious that I wasn't seeing clearly
'Cause right before my eyes you were disappearing
If I could just go back in time
Say the words that blow your mind
Loneliness is such a crime
There ain't a thing I wanna do
I wanna do yeah

Maybe I wouldn't have been so
Crazy I was stupid letting you go
Baby I want to take it back tonight

Oh oh oh oh x2
You don't have to tell me twice
When lighting strikes

Oh oh oh oh x2
You don't have to tell me twice
When lighting strikes

Why I
Let you go
Why I

Oh oh oh oh
No oh oh oh oh
You don't have to tell me twice
You don't have to tell me twice

Oh oh ooh x2
You don't have to tell me twice
When lighting strikes

You don't have to tell me twice
When lightning strikes
