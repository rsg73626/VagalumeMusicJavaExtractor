PASS ME BY

Remember that trip we took in Mexico?
Yeah, hanging with the boys and all your se√±oritas
I never spoke up, yeah, I never said, "Hello,"
But I keep on trying to find a way to meet ya
Yeah

I was chillin', you were with him
Hooked up by the fire
Now he's long gone
I'm like, "So long."
Now I got my chance
Now I, now I got my chance

Like damn
You could be the one that could mess me up
You could be the one that'll break me
Damn
All them other girls said they had enough
You could be the one that'll take me
I was solo,
Living Yolo
'Til you blew my mind

Like damn
You could be the one that could mess me up
I can't let you, can't let you pass me by
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by

I was tryna play too cool to get caught up
Like, too fun, too young to fall to pieces
I know a girl like you can't ever get enough
So I'm addicted, trippin', tryna get you to see this

The way I need you, like I'm see-through
Dancing out my pants
Got you shooken, caught you looking
Now I got my chance
Now I, now I got my chance

Like damn
You could be the one that could mess me up
You could be the one that'll break me
Damn
All them other girls said they had enough
You could be the one that'll take me
I was solo,
Living Yolo
'Til you blew my mind

Like damn
You could be the one that could mess me up
I can't let you, can't let you pass me by
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by

It's like
Everywhere I look and everywhere I go
A million other guys keep staring and I know
That I could be yours, and you could be mine
I just can't let you pass me by, by, by

You could be the one that could mess me up

Yeah, I can't let you pass me by
