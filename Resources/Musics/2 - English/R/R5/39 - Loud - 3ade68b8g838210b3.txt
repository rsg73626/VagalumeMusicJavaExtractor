LOUD

(Come on, get loud)

Looking for the one tonight
But I can't see you
'Cause I'm blinded by all the lights, ooh
And I can never get it right
I need a breakthrough
Why are you so hard to find? Ooh

I've been searching every city
Never giving up
Until I find my angel
Diamond in the rough
Looking for a signal
Baby turn it up tonight

Come on get loud loud let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops 
Come on get loud 'til they shut us down

Come on get loud loud let it out
Show me everything that you've got
Come on get loud loud I need you now
Baby let me hear it loud
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa

Looking for the light to shine
To start a fire
And girl I'll be the first in line ooh
And baby when our stars align
We can't get no higher
You just give me a sign

Come on get loud loud let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come on get loud 'til they shut us down

Come on get loud loud let it out
Show me everything that you've got
Come on get loud loud I need you now
Baby let me hear it loud
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa

Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa

Come on get loud loud let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come on get loud 'til they shut us down

Come on get loud loud let it out
Show me everything that you've got
Come on get loud loud I need you now
Baby let me hear it loud
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
Baby let me hear it loud
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
Baby let me hear it loud
Na na na na na naa
Na na na na na naa
I've been looking for the one tonight
