DID YOU HAVE YOUR FUN?

Just being honest, you can't tie me down
Life is a short trip, and I've been around
Oh, Sydney out in Tokyo, don't tell her man
I swear I didn't know it but she didn't care

Said "put your hands where I can see
I'll make you write this song for me"

She's so bad she's good for me
This girl knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Did you have your fun?

I like the music, and asked her to dance
She said "no we're leaving
But don't tell my friends"
Underneath the street lights, there was smoke in the air
She said she's never like this while she's pulling my hair

Said "put your hands where I won't see
Baby I won't say a thing
Stop leaving stains of cigarettes
And come put your lips on me"

She's so bad she's good for me
This girl knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Did you have your fun?

What you runnin from?
Draw your guns
Draw your guns
Tell me what it is you're running from
Draw your guns
Draw your guns
Draw your guns
Baby did you have your fun?

She's so bad she's good for me
This girl knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Love me, leave me, left me numb

She's so bad she's good for me
This girls knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Did you have your fun?
