IF

All my days run together
like whisky and Coke
Hope my nights last forever
like The Rolling Stones
All up in your timeline
double tapping I like, like
Hoping that you don't mind, mind
That was four weeks old
Caught up in your eyes, eyes
We've been talking online, line
I won't trade you no lies, lies
That you've heard before

Tell me, if you could love me
Make me somebody
If you could love me, do
Can you take on my feelings
Angels and demons
If you could love me, do
I could be with you

Catch a flight down to Rio
roll up on a beach
Vaca paid, no dinheiro, the perks of the peach
All up in your vibes, vibes
You got something I like, like
Sweet like sugar and spice, spice
cool like icicle
Baby let's get hectic
Throwin' all of your lettuce, spend it all on your dressin'
Freaking wonderful

Tell me, if you could love me
Make me somebody
If you could love me, do
Can you take on my feelings
Angels and demons
If you could love me, do
I could be with you

I could, and I would
I could be with you, I could be with you
I could, and I would
I could be with you, I could be with you

Yeah, ohh
Now I know what you like
Damn, we got a good life
If you could love

If you could love me
Make me somebody
If you could love me, do
Can you take on my feelings
Angels and demons
If you could love me, do
I could be with you
Baby, I wanna know
I could be with you
I could, and I would
I could be with you
