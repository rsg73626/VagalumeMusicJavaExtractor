NINE LIVES

Ring the alarm
It's getting dark
Can't see my shadow

This broken town
Is breaking me down
I'll grab my things and go
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Climbed out the top
Out of this box
To feel the daylight

I'm at the door
There's something more
And all that I don't know
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I got nine lives
Here in this wasteland
Don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

Don't need nobody to save me
Give up
You know I'm never slowing down

Free fall
I wanna feel it all

I got nine lives
Not gonna waste it
Don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

Don't need a match
Keep me on track
I found my own road

Don't got a dime
But I got time
To wait for tomorrow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I wanna get lost in the city of lights
Jump off the edge of the world tonight
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I got nine lives
Here in this wasteland
Don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

Don't need nobody to save me
Give up
You know I'm never slowing down

Free fall
I wanna feel it all

I got nine lives
Not gonna waste it
Don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

I'm never gonna hit the brakes
I, I, keep running 'till the better days
You know I'm never slowing down
I, I, I'll drive this car into the ground

Ring the alarm
It's getting dark
Can't see my shadow

This broken town
Is breaking me down
I'll grab my things and go
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I got nine lives
Here in this wasteland
Don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

Don't need nobody to save me
Give up
You know I'm never slowing down

Free fall
I wanna feel it all

I got nine lives
Not gonna waste it
Don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground

I got nine lives
Not gonna waste it
I don't care
I'll drive this car into the ground
