HURTS GOOD

It's hard to speak
Mumbling my poetry
But talk is cheap, uh
Your body's sayin' other things
No need to fear
'cause the crew is here
If tonight you're free
Oh come and get a groove with me

Glowing like no other
Can I get another?
Must be nice to look like that, yeah
Who gave you my number?
They deserve a pay bomb
Who taught you to move like that?

Say that you want me
Just to want somebody
Tell me you need me
'cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya
Crave the pain I get from you

A killer queen (yeah)
Never really as she seems
A super freak (a super freak)
She's darling with her magazines
But I'm right here
And I volunteer
If tonight you're free
Come and get a groove with me

Hey I know you're trouble
Pourin' me a double
Damn it's nice to feel like that
You're my biggest wonder
I think that I could love ya
Must be nice to live like that

Say that you want me
Just to want somebody
Tell me you need me
'cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya
Crave the pain I get from you

(ooh baby)

My head aches
My heart aches
I'm awake
I'm alive
My head aches
My heart aches
I'm awake
I'm alive

Say that you want me
Just to want somebody
Tell me you need me
'cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya
Crave the pain I get from you

(hurts good to want ya take the pain I get from you)
