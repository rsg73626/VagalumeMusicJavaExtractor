CRAZY STUPID LOVE

Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid love

I never cared bout my stupid hair
Before you came into my life, babe
I would have never seen that my eyes were green
Till I laid them right on you, babe

Won't you come and stay a while?
Electrified, you blow my mind
In every single way

Oh
Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid love
I'm losing all control
Oh oh
Whatever it takes, baby
It's crazy, stupid love
I'm feeling through your bones
Oh oh

Crazy (crazy)
Stupid (stupid)

People say that chicks will make
You do a crazy thing or two
But I don't care what people say
Cuz you, ha, you!

Make me feel like I can fly
Electrified, you blow my mind
In every single way

Oh
Wherever we go, yeah
It's crazy, stupid love
I'm losing all control

Put your hands and let's party, baby
You just hear the truth, it makes me
