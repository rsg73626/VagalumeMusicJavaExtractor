EASY LOVE

Lovin' you ain't easy
Nothin' ever is
But I will keep on fightin'
For a love like this

You know I wouldn't have it 
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love

This is a track for the guys with
One lady in their life
You wanna pull out your hair sometimes
But she's still your girl

A love that lasts is like a unicorn
Holdin' on, a lost star form
Sometimes you wanna throw in the towel
But she's still your girl

Lovin' you ain't easy
Nothin' ever is
But I will keep on fightin'
For a love like this

You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love

Second verse goes to the females
Rollin' their eyes when we fail
Make you wanna go and shop retail
But he's still your man

Are we crass? Undeniable
Dirtbags, we're professional
Sometimes you wanna throw in the towel
But he's still your man

Lovin' you ain't easy
Nothin' ever is
But I will keep on fightin'
For a love like this

You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love

I don't believe in "Nothin' lasts forever"
And every time you're feelin' down
I know we're gonna work it out

And I know we can't live without each other
Ooh oh
Well nothin' worth havin' comes easy
And baby you got me singin'

Lovin' you ain't easy
Nothin' ever is
But I will keep on fightin'
For a love like this

You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love

Lovin' you ain't easy
Nothin' ever is
But I will keep on fightin'
For a love like this

You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love
