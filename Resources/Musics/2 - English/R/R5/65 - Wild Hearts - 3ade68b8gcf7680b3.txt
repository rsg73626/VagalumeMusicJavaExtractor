WILD HEARTS

Go ahead, grab your guns
Draw a line and we'll cross the fun
Let's go
Yeah, one by one they fall
Taken out by alcohol
Pour souls

On a night like this I remember
How I miss my window
And I know this
We better live our lives up to the fullest
Till we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run
Your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run
We'll all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down

Been down this road before
Hit the walk, kick down the door
Let's go
Money, power, want a taste
I pray to God it don't go to waste
Don't know

On a night like this I remember
How I miss my window
And I know this
We better live our lives up to the fullest
Till we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run
Your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run
We'll all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down

And I know this
We better live our lives up to the fullest
Till we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run
Your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run
We'll all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down
