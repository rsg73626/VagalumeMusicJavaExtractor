I CAN'T SAY I'M IN LOVE

I Can't Say I'm In Love

Heart's beatin' faster, might need some surgery
Natural disaster, you're takin' over me
And I st-st-stutter, vision bl-blurry
There ain't no other that brings me to my knees

And it gets so hot whenever we're alone,
But I can't say I'm in love
No, I won't

I don't know what love is,
But I know I've never felt like this
Your kiss is magic
Like a circle, yeah, it's perfectness
And I can say yes, tell you "Me too"
You say it first, it's easy for you
Even though I know that it's true,
I can't say I'm in love
(Woah-ah-ah-oah-woah, woah! Woah-ah-ah-oah-woah, woah! Woah!)
Even though I know that it's true,
(Woah-ah-oo-woah)
I can't say I'm in love

Pa-paranoia, it's runnin' through my veins
I got to know ya, that was the end for me

And I know I got ya holding onto words that I can't say
And everything ya feel for me, just know I feel the same

I don't know what love is,
But I know I've never felt like this
Your kiss is magic
Like a circle, yeah, it's perfectness
And I can say yes, tell you "Me too"
You say it first, it's easy for you
Even though I know that it's true,
I can't say I'm in love
(Woah-ah-ah-oah-woah, woah! Woah-ah-ah-oah-woah, woah! Woah!)
Even though I know that it's true,
(Woah-ah-oo-woah)
I can't say I'm in love

Open up my heart, open up my mind
Everything is changed to color from black and white
Everything I see is a new reality
Baby, is this love?

Yeah, is this love? Is this love?
Yeah, this is love!

I know what love is,
And I know I've never felt like this
Your kiss is magic
Like a circle, yeah, it's perfectness
I can say yes, tell you "Me too"
I'll say it first, only for you
I can say yes, tell you "Me too"
I'll say it first, only for you
I'm starting to realize that it's true
(Woah-ah-oo-woah)
I'll say it first, only for you
(Woah-ah-oo-woah)
There's only one thing left to do
(Say!)
Baby, I love you
(Woah-ah-ah-oah-woah, woah! Woah-ah-ah-oah-woah, woah! Woah!)
Baby, I'm in love with you (Woah! Woah!)
(Woah-ah-oo-woah)
Baby, I love you
