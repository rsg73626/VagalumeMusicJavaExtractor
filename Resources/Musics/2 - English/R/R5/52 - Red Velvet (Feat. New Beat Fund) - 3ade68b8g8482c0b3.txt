RED VELVET (FEAT. NEW BEAT FUND)

I keep telling 'em too
I keep telling 'em

She likes to make me think
That I'm a freak just for her velvet
All wrapped in between her ivory
And I can't help it

Listening to "Novacane"
Ocean on repeat again
Oh, baby, you were worth the wait
Baby, you were worth the wait

I will drive all night
When you're wearing velvet, girl
Right here by my side
Takes me to another world
I will drive all night
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way
I will drive all night
Nobody makes me feel this way
Feel this way

She's making deals
I'm in her ear and getting overzealous
We're swimming in her velvet, damn
Makes all her neighbors jealous

Listening to Purple Rain
Crying over doves again
Oh, baby, you were worth the wait
Baby, you were worth the wait

I will drive all night
When you're wearing velvet, girl
Right here by my side
Takes me to another world
I will drive all night
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way
I will drive all night
Nobody makes me feel this way
Feel this way

[New Beat Fund:]
Let me tell you 'bout my girl, uh
She a boss lady, female dictatorship
She make other models look like tater chips
Ask me if I dig her style, eyes, legs and lips
I'd have to say, "Yes, yes, I do, and hell yes. "
Brain amazing, she even dig Hendrix
Hit me in my deep blue, heart beats reckless
In the bedroom, wanna touch her every freckle
I hit her from the bass and I let her scream treble

[Ross:]
Nobody makes me feel this way
Feel this way, yeah

Nobody makes me feel this way
I will drive all night
Nobody makes me feel this way
I will drive all night
Nobody makes me feel this way
Feel this way

Yeah, baby
Listening to "Novacane"
Ocean on repeat again

You know you make me feel like a whole new man

Listening to Purple Rain
Prince is on repeat again

Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
