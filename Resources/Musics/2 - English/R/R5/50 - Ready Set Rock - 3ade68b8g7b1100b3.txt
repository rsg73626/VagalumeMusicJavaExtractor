READY SET ROCK

Fog lights out of sight
High tops lace it up converse chucks tight
Spikes up
Gloves cut strapped up
Sharp stuff don't touch so hot we're burning up

Spotlight
This is our time
Gonna shine so bright I'm gonna live my life
So tough
This rocks so rough can't be crushed cuz I stay focused

Ready ready or not (3x)
Ready set rock
Show em what we got
Taking it all the way to the top

Ready set rock
Just can't stop
Going into earthquake after shock

Ready set rock
Don't stop till you rock the spotlight up
The sky high can you take the limelight?
Strobe lights slow-mo vibe in overdrive
Sure the crowd tide scream-o ride on amplify

Tongue tied when you look in my eyes
Don't blink if you think that I might bite bite
So sweet metal beat the speaker cries
Rock won't get caught cuz we never hide

Ready ready or not (3x)
Ready set rock
Show em what we got
Taking it all the way to the top

Ready set rock
Just can't stop
Going into earthquake after shock
Ready set rock
