STARTING OVER

Hey! Woo! Come on!

Yeah the same old scenery
Ain't round here waiting for me 
anymore (anymore)
Oh anymore (anymore)
I I I'm onto something new
What I had before was out the door
And it just won't do
Gonna switch it up a different view (hey, oooh)

I gotta change it up, turn around
Cause I know what I need now
I'm getting it now
I gotta start it over

(Chorus)
Yeah I gotta hit reset, begin again
Ain't never going back to where I've been
Whoa Whoa
well I'm starting over
Yeah I'm gonna reboot,redo, check my flow
Keep moving along. till I get where I wanna go
Whoa Whoa
Cause I've been there
Done that and looking over my shoulder
I'm starting over

I've been getting nowhere and getting there faster
Heard a voice in my head said 
"you can't let this last" (let this last)
It's all in the past (It's all in the past)
sometimes you gotta take a chance, take a risk
Find out everything I've been that you've missed
start over(start over)

(Chorus)
Yeah gotta hit reset, begin again
Ain't never going back to where I've been
Whoa Whoa
well,I'm starting over (I'm starting over)
Yeah I'm gonna redoot, redo, check my flow
Keep moving along till I get where I wanna go
Whoa Whoa
Cause I've been there
Done that and looking over my shoulder
I'm starting over
(2x)

Yeah I'm dreaming of something new
Oh out with the old, and in with the new
I'm starting over
Starting over
Starting over
Yeah!
