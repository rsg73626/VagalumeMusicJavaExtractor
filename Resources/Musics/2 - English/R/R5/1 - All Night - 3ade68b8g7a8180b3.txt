ALL NIGHT

We're staying all night
Got blue jean baby playing in my mind
She gets me so high
Givin me faith I gotta testify

And the way that she walks I can't hide it
If I said I don't like it I'm lyin'
Hold tight (yeah)
A little bit of love will change your life

She said I'm outta my head, I'm going out of my mind
And when I'm out on the edge will you save me, save me
Can we live for the moment, can you live for tonight
Can we forget what was broken
And say say say we'll be

All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night

And now it's midnight
And I can feel your electricity
Give me that skin tight
Good girls ain't ever makin' history
Nope

And we'll dance in the streets 'till the morning
Never sleep when the city is callin'
Hold tight
A little bit of love will change your life (change your life)

She said I'm outta my head, I'm going out of my mind
And when I'm out on the edge will you save me, save me
Can we live for the moment, can you live for tonight
Can we forget what was broken
And say say say we'll be

All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night

We'll be all right
We'll be all right
We'll be all right
We'll be all right

And we got nothing but time
(We'll be all right)
To make the most of this life
(We'll be all right)
Take on the wrongs and the rights
(We'll be all right)
Forget them all and just say say say
Ohh won't you say it now
We'll be all right

All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night
All night
