F.E.E.L.G.O.O.D.

Something felt so good when you said my name
All that I want from you is to feel the same
Stay for the night I want to show you
What the real you is like
Turn back the time
I'm only living when you are here in my life
And now you're leaving

My heart's lonely without you
My eyes only see you and me
Stupid thinking about you
It's hard, hard, cause you make me feel good
Cause you make me feel good

Maybe this is love and maybe I'm insane
Temptation's pullin' me now I can't escape
(I-I-I wil) give me the night
I wanna know all of the secrets you hide
Lay by my side
I'm only livin' when you're here in my life
And now you're leavin'

My heart's lonely without you
My eyes only see you and me
Stupid thinking about you
It's hard, hard, cuz you make me feel good
Cuz you make me feel good

F-e-e-l g-o-o-d
Yes I feel good, sing it with me
F-e-e-l g-o-o-d
Yes I feel good, sing it with me
F-e-e-l g-o-o-d
Yes I feel good, sing it with me
F-e-e-l g-o-o-d
Yes I feel good, sing it with me

My heart's lonely without you
My eyes only see you and me
Stupid thinking about you
It's hard, hard, cuz you make me feel good
Cuz you make me feel good

Yes, I feel good
F-e-e-l g-o-o-d
