BABY IT'S YOU

The way that I tremble
The way that I shake
It's you, it's you
The way that I feel
The way my heart breaks
It's you

The way that I'm brave
And when I'm afraid
It's you, it's you
Each time I keep
A promise I made
It's you, it's you

Ooh, ooh
It's not the moon
It's not the light
It's not the fire, shines so bright
It's not the dream
It's not the kiss
It is what it is, what it is

Baby it's you, baby it's you
The crazy things I do
Baby it's you, baby it's you
You're everything, it's true

Every time that I fall down,
One thing pulls me through
Baby it's you, baby it's you
You

Night after night,
And day after day
It's you, it's you
Each time I keep
A promise I made
It's you, whoa

It's not the song
It's not the sun
It's not the stars that light us above
It's not the dream
It's not the kiss
It is what it is, what it is

Baby it's you, baby it's you
The crazy things I do
Baby it's you, baby it's you
You're everything, it's true

Every time that I fall down,
One thing pulls me through
Baby it's you, baby it's you
You

Oooh
Everybody's asking me why
Oooh
I try and I try but I'm not gonna die

The way that I tremble
The way that I shake
It's you, it's you

Baby it's you, baby it's you
The crazy things I do
Baby it's you, baby it's you
You're everything, it's true
(Everything it's true)

Every time that I fall down,
One thing pulls me through
Baby it's you, baby it's you
You, baby it's you
