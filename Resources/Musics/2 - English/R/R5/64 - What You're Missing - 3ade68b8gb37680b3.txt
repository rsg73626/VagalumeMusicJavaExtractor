WHAT YOU'RE MISSING

OO-wee-oo
OO-wee-oo
OO-wee-oo

We're so beautiful, and so broken
I think the cover is about to crack open
I watched you, through the window
At the abbey looking like you're in a video
When your so-called friends turn away
A shadow crosses over your face
For a minute I know just what you're thinking
You might have it all but you're short of one thing

Living in a plastic world you
Think you're such a lucky girl you
Got your diamonds and your pearls but
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
I could be your that you need to
Feel like you are finally free from
A life that leaves you so empty but
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing, girl

OO-wee-oo
OO-wee-oo

All the posers that hover around you
Dropping names and cash like the who's who
But they all think that Hollywood and hot class
Bet the numbers all wind up in the trash
And though you seem so hard to get to
I know all the secret places I could find you
I like that you like to slum it on the dark side
Well I could keep you entertained for a while

Living in a plastic world you
Think you're such a lucky girl you
Got your diamonds and your pearls but
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
I could be your that you need to
Feel like you are finally free from
A life that leaves you so empty but
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing, girl

And girl
When there's nobody else around
I'll make it okay to come down
Take off your converse and your crown
Cause you've been wandering, I've been waiting
And I'm what's missing

OO-wee-oo
OO-wee-oo
OO-wee-oo

Living in a plastic world you
Think you're such a lucky girl you
Got your diamonds and your pearls but
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
I could be your that you need to
Feel like you are finally free from
A life that leaves you so empty
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing, girl

I'm what you're missing girl
OO-wee-oo
I'm what you're missing, girl
OO-wee-oo
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
Yeah, yeah
I'm what you're missing (woah, woah), girl
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
