ANYTHINGS YOU WANT

There's something about the way that you look at me
There's something about the way that you talk to me
But you don't know what I'm gonna do

There's something about the way that you say my name
It hurts to know you don't feel the same
No, you don't think about what you're doing to me
So it's the day to open up your eyes

(Chorus)
I can be anything you want,
I can be everything you want, (x2)
everything you want.
Cause I can be anything you want,
I can be everything you want.

I can spend my days dreaming I'm your man
I'll pick you up, take you out, even hold your hand
When you're next to me
But it's just a dream, you see
and I don't wanna open up my eyes

(Chorus)

I can be the light that lights the way
When you need someone, just call out my name
I'll be here for you in the darkest of your days
So if you give me a chance,
then you'll understand that

(Chorus)
