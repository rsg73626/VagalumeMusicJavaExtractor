ALWAYS

I don't know what you're up to
But baby I see me and you
Walking around, through the town
Always
We can sail around the sea
No one else, just you and me
Laying in the sand, holding hands
Always

‘Cause I waited so long for you
To tell me
You love me too
I hope I'm not too late
To see your face
It's all the time
Stop asking questions
Just make up your mind
Baby, take your time
Baby, don't be shy
Just come with me darling
And we can fly
Where ever you wanna go
(Wanna go)
And I'll always hold you close
(Always hold you close)
Always

Girl, I'm yours forever more
My friends may ask,
But I am sure
I'll be right here
For you my dear
Always
No one can keep me away
I'm for real, I'm here to stay
I'll be your man, understand
Always

‘Cause I waited so long for you
To tell me
You love me too
I hope I'm not too late
To see your face
It's all the time
Stop asking questions
Just make up your mind
Baby, take your time
Baby, don't be shy
Just come with me darling
And we can fly
Where ever you wanna go
(Wanna go)
And I'll always hold you close
(Always hold you close)
Always

I'll be everything you need
My love is so strong
Don't pretend that you don't know
I've been here all along
Girl, I waited so long for you
To tell me you love me too
I hope I'm not too late
Girl, I promise I will wait
To see your face

It's all the time
Stop asking questions
Just make up your mind
Baby, take your time
Baby, don't be shy
Just come with me darling
And we can fly
No one can catch us
‘Cause no one knows
I'll be your guy, and you'll be my girl
We'll fly away
And I'll run the world
If there's one thing you should know
Is that I'll always hold you close
Always
