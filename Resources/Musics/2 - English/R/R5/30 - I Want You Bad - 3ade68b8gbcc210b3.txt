I WANT YOU BAD

In the back of a taxi cab,
One quick turn you were on my lap,
We touched hands and we pulled them back, yeah,
I want you bad!

And even though it should be so wrong,
I can't help but feel this strong,
Cause the way you turn me on like
A light switch

I might just go crazy,
'Cause you're my best friend's baby,
But you got me thinking maybe, just maybe,
I don't know what to do!

I'm in love with someone else's girl
You rock my world,
But you're the one that I can't have,
Girl, I want you bad!

In my crazy mind
I'm with you all the time,
Cause you're the best I never had,
Oh girl, I want you bad!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

I want you bad!

So hard to just pretend.
It sucks, 
She's his girl and he's my friend,
No good way for this to end, yeah,
I want you bad!

I wish someone could help me,
This is just so unhealthy!
And everything you got just kills me,
Goin' guilty!

Go crazy!
'Cause you're my best friend's baby,
But you got me thinking maybe, just maybe,
I don't know what to do!

I'm in love with someone else's girl,
You rock my world,
But you're the one that I can't have,
Girl, I want you bad!

In my crazy mind
I'm with you all the time,
Cause you're the best I never had,
Oh, girl I want you bad!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

I want you bad!

I want you, I want you,
I want you, I want you,
I want you, I want you,

I want you bad!
(I want you bad!)

I want you, I want you,
I want you, I want you,
I want you, I want you,
I want you

I might just go crazy!
'Cause you're my best friend's baby,
But you got me thinking maybe, just maybe,
I don't know what to do!

I'm in love with someone else's girl,
You rock my world,
But you're the one that I can't have,
Girl, I want you bad!

In my crazy mind
I'm with you all the time,
Cause you're the best I never had,
Oh, girl, I want you bad!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

I want you bad!

Oh, girl, I want you bad!
