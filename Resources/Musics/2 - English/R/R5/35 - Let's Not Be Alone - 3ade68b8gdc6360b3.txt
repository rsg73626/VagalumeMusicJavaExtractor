LET'S NOT BE ALONE

Outside of the party where is getting too loud
It feels like we're the only ones alone in the crowd
Check call and the politics and time we spend
You look back and you say you think
That you I've lost all your friends
And I'm hoping that it's all my fault
Yeah, I'm hoping that it's all my fault

Hey let's not be alone tonight
Hey let's not be alone tonight
No it don't no it don't mean love
But it might but I might be love
Hey let's not be alone tonight

Not wrong if you come on strong cause life it's too short
I like how we get along like snow in new york
All good if you change your mind you know where I stand
Look back and you say you think that
You I've lost all your friends
And I know you know it's all your fault
Yeah I know you know it's all your fault

Hey let's not be alone tonight
Hey let's not be alone tonight
No it don't no it don't mean love
But it might but I might be love
Hey let's not be alone tonight
And I know it's got to be my fault
Yeah I know it's got to be my fault
Yeah I know it's got to be my fault

We may never feel the same
I'm just glad you came
Am I right or is it all in my head
Like hey let's not be alone tonight
Hey let's not be alone tonight
No it don't no it don't mean love
But it might but I might be love

Hey let's not be alone tonight
You don't have to be alone tonight
Hey you don't have to be alone tonight
No it don't no it don't mean love
But it might it might be love
Hey let's not be alone tonight
