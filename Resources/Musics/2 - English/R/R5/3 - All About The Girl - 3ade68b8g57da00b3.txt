ALL ABOUT THE GIRL

High heels, got a taste for fashion
Converse and a fatal attraction
She's got that something I'm looking for
Oh, oh

Maybe she lives in the city
She may be smart and she may be pretty
She's got that something I'm looking for

Whoever she is, she is out of this world
It's all about the girl that I meet
On the bus or on the street
It's all about the girl in my mind
That I'll meet one day, it's a matter of time
Oh oh oh oh oh oh HEY
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's all about the girl
One day I'll find

Brown eyes, they're full of emotion
I don't know what sets it in motion
She'll have that something I'm looking for
Oh, oh

I'll search in every direction
Until I make the connection
She'll have that something I'm looking for

Whoever she is, she is out of this world
It's all about the girl that I meet
On the bus or on the street
It's all about the girl in my mind
That I'll meet one day, it's a matter of time
Oh oh oh oh oh oh HEY
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's all about the girl
One day I'll find

She'll say she knows me
I think that's true
You are the answer that I always knew
And when I hold her
And when we kiss
There ain't no question it comes down to this
Yeah

It's all about the girl that I meet
On the bus or on the street
It's all about the girl in my mind
That I'll meet one day

It's all about the girl that I meet
On the bus or on the street
It's all about the girl in my mind
That I'll meet one day, it's a matter of time

Oh oh oh oh oh oh HEY
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's all about the girl
One day I'll find that girl
