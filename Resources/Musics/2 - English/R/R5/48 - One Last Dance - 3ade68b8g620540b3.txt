ONE LAST DANCE

Tear drops in your hazel eyes
I can't believe I made you cry
It feels so long since we went wrong
But you're still on my mind
Never meant to break your heart
Sometimes things just fall apart
So here's one night to make it right
Before we say goodbye

So wait up, wait up
Give me one more chance
To make up, make up
I just need one last dance

Freshman year I saw your face
Now it's graduation day
Said we'd be friends till the end
Can we start again?

So wait up, wait up
Give me one more chance
To make up, make up
I just need one last dance

Na na na na oh-oh
Na na na na oh-oh

I heard you're heading east
So let's just make our peace
So when you think of me
You'll smile and I'll smile

So wait up, wait up
Give me one more chance
To make up, make up
I just need one last dance

So wait up, wait up
Give me one more chance
Just one song
Then I'll move on

Give me one last dance
I just need one last dance
With you
