DNA

When we are hanging out
Laughing and making out
The world just disappears
Your friends just look at me
I'm not what they wanna see
I'm not from that atmosphere

I see the city lights
You watch the stars at night
I know there's a long road in between
Together we shine so bright
Won't leave without a fight
Their venom words can't bother me

‘Cause I don't care, care, care
What they say, say, say
We've got the same, same DNA
They can talk, talk, talk
All they want, want, want
But this love won't go away

You're my angel
(Need you back in my life)
You're my angel
(Never will leave you)

No I don't care, care, care
What they say, say, say
We've got the same, same DNA

She's never late you see
How she put up with me
So perfect bodies, yeah
Her friends say she's better off
They're telling her
With me she's wasting her time

I know you're happy, wait
We're done with the chasing games
Somehow you're dreaming of me
Together we shine so bright
Won't leave without a fight
No onE will ever stop me

‘Cause I don't care, care, care
What they say, say, say
We've got the same, same DNA
They can talk, talk, talk
All they want, want, want
But this love won't go away

You're my angel
(Need you back in my life)
You're my angel
(Never will leave you)

Whoa, we gotta turn around
Whoa, they can't tear us down
They'll try to find a way
To try to find our hearts
But no matter what they say
We'll never break apart

Whoa, and this is how
Whoa, I'm never giving up
You and I is all we've got
We gotta keep the fire burning

No, I don't care, care, care
What they say, say, say
We've got the same, same DNA

‘Cause I don't care, care, care
What they say, say, say
We've got the same, same DNA
They can talk, talk, talk
All they want, want, want
But this love won't go away

You're my angel
(Need you back in my life)
You're my angel
(Never will leave you)

No I don't care, care, care
What they say, say, say
We've got the same, same DNA
