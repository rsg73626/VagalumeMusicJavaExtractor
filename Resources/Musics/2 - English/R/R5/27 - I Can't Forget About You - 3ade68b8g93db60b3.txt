I CAN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU

On no, here we go
Hear your voice on the radio
Like every single song is about you

Every sec that we spend
Like some mess stuck up in my head
Got me so distracted and confused

Baby I think I've lost my mind
Feels like you crashed into my life
I keep on losing track of time

I'm so messed up, yeah, I'm so messed up
I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?
Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you (ooh, ooh)
Forget about you (ooh, ooh)

Think that it's coming back
Something 'bout the time we had
Wish that we would have been recorded
So right, super tight
Can't recall a thing last night
But woke up with a smile in the morning

Baby I think I've lost my mind
Feels like you crashed into my life
I keep on losing track of time

I'm so messed up, yeah, I'm so messed up
I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?
Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you (ooh, ooh)
Forget about you (ooh, ooh)

I just can't forget about (yeah you, you, you)
Forget about you (ooh, ohh)
I just can't forget about you

Which way is up? Which way is down?
Can't stop this room from spinning 'round
I'm floating high
High off the ground
Caught in my head
Can't get you out

I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?
Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you (ooh, ooh)
Forget about you (ooh, ooh)
I just can't forget about you (ooh, ooh)
Forget about you (ooh, ooh)
Ooh whooah whoah
Ooh whooah whoah
Ohh ohh oohh
Ohh ohh oohh
