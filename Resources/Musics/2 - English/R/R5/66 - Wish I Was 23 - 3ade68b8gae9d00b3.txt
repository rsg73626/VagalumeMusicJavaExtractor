WISH I WAS 23

Maybe she's just too old for me
Living in a teenage fantasy
Feeling there's so much we could be
She's got me wishing, wishing I was 23

Man, she's crazy, but I don't care
She's sexy and she's a millionaire
The way she gets me is so unfair
Not your typical rich girl

She's smoking hot, if you know what I mean
Tight jeans and she loves photography
And everything that's in between
She's been around the world

I know she's graduated,
And I'm not quite educated
I'm young, you know
Age is overrated

(Chorus)
Maybe she's just too old for me
Living in a teenage fantasy
Baby, there's so much we could be
Every time I'm with her, calling me a dreamer

Maybe she's just out of my reach
Maybe her boyfriend's a Marine
Even though I'm nameless (Hey)
She's famous (Hey)
She's got me wishing, wishing I was 23

Whoa-ohh
Oh oh-oh
Wishin' I was 23
Whoa-ohh
She's got me wishing, oh yeah

I think about her everyday
Going insane thinking about what to say
What am I doing anyway?
Am I even on her radar?

I know she's graduated
I'm not quite educated
I'm young, you know
Age is overrated

(Chorus)

Whoa-ohh
Oh oh-oh
Wishin' I was 23
Oh ohh
I've got her wishing, oh

If I was older
She would let me take her
To watch the stars at night
We can dance, we can kiss, underneath the moonlight

And if it got colder,
She would let me hold her
Wrapped up in fairytales,
Gotta wake up from this dream

Maybe she's just too old for me
Maybe her boyfriend's a Marine
Even though I'm nameless
She's famous
She's got me wishin'

(Chorus)

Woah-ohh
Woah-oh-oh
Wishing I was 23
Oh ohh

I've got her wishing,
Wishing she was 17
Woah-oh (x2)
Wishing I was 23 (x2)
