SMILE

Today I feel like running naked through your street
To get your atention (woah oh oh)
I broke up with my girl
So tell me where to meet
Oh did I mention (woah oh oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel alright?
Baby I don't wanna see you cry (no oh)

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Today I feel like blowing all my cash on you
I'll buy you anything
Until I'm broke
Today I wanna turn your skies from gray to blue
And if rains on you
I'll be your coat (woah oh oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel alright?
Baby I don't wanna see you cry (no oh)

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Let me take your picture baby
I'll save it for a rainy day
I don't need much I guess I'm just old fashioned in that way
So on a count of three let's see you

(One, two, one, two, one, two, three)

Smile

I wanna see you smile (I wanna make you smile)
I wanna see you smile
It's the thing to do
I wanna make you smile
