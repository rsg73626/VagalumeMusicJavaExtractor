DOCTOR, DOCTOR

I just gotta realize
The fire in your eyes for me
And baby all these little sparks
Ignite until I just can't breathe

And time, and time, and time, and time, and time again
I'm laying in the dark
and wonder where you are
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to find the way to send
Straight into my heart
It's tearing me apart

I'm screaming doctor, doctor, bottle it up!
I'm a believer, believe me
This love is a drug!
OO-oo-oo
I'm dying, I can't get enough
I'm screaming doctor, doctor, bottle it up!

I hadn't slept a couple nights
Been staring at the ceiling again
The side effect I know too well
I'm addicted to the feeling

And time, and time, and time, and time, and time again
I'm living in a dream
Or somewhere in between
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to find the way to send
It's everything I need
You're the remedy

I'm screaming doctor, doctor, bottle it up!
I'm a believer, believe me
This love is a drug!
OO-oo-oo
I'm dying, I can't get enough
I'm screaming doctor, doctor, bottle it up!

Doctor, doctor, bottle it up
I'm a believer, believe me
This love is a drug
OO-oo-oo
I'm dying, I can't get enough
Doctor, doctor

I'm screaming doctor, doctor, bottle it up!
I'm a believer, believe me
This love is a drug!
OO-oo-oo
I'm dying, I can't get enough
I'm screaming doctor, doctor, bottle it up!
