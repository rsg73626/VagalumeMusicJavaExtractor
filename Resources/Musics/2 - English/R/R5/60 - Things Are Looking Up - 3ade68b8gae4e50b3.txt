THINGS ARE LOOKING UP

You were a business, I was a start up
You were like high speed, I was on dial up
I needed caffeine, you were a Starbucks
A Starbucks
(A double-shot)

You were a record, I was a remix
You were the sunshine, I was a rain check
You needed time but you were my Rolex
My Rolex (my Rollie)

I couldn't get it right
'Til you opened up my eyes
You turn my whole world upside down (two, three, four)

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
Even when I'm down
Had about enough
Lookin' at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up

You were a diamond, I was a coal mine
You were a free-way, I was a stop sign
I was a pay check, you're like a gold mine, 
A gold mine (money, money)

I couldn't get it right
'Til you opened up my eyes
You turned my whole world upside down

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
Even when I'm down
Had about enough
Lookin' at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up

[2x]
I've been up and I've been down
Girl you make my world go 'round
There's nothin' like the high I found
Things are looking up
Things are looking up

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
Even when I'm down
Had about enough
Lookin' at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking
Things are looking up

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
Even when I'm down
Had about enough
Lookin' at the ground
I couldn't find a star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
