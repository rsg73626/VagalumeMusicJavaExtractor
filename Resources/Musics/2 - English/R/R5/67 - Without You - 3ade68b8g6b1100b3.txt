WITHOUT YOU

You're on my mind
Every night
And in the morning when I wake
Don't leave me lonely

Can you just hold me
Together before I break
I just can breath
Without you without you

I'm so lonely
Without you without you
I just can't be
Without you without you

Cuz today
You are all I need
There is something
I see in your eyes
Oh and it gives me butterflies

I just cant stop thinking
You make me weaken
Don't you know I will be true
I just can breath

Without you without you
I'm so lonely
Without you without you
I just can't be
Without you without you

Cuz today
You are all I need
I'm going crazy without you (3x)
I just can breath

Without you without you
I'm so lonely
Without you without you
I just can't be

Without you without you
Cuz today
You are all I need
