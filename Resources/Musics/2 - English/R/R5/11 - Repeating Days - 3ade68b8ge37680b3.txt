REPEATING DAYS

Climb the stairs to your apartment
Just to see you holding him
You try to tell me that it's nothing
So I can come in back again

You're looking right in my eyes
And I know that you're lying
When you say that you're mine
And there's nobody else
But even when we fight
I can't stop from loving you
You know we can't be friends
I guess this is how it ends

Things that you say
I can't erase
Repeating days
It's all the same

Driving home, I'm empty hearted
Broken pictures on the floor
And when I thought that it was over
I see you standing at the door

I'm looking right in your eyes
And you know that I'm lying
When I say that I'm fine
There'll be somebody else
But after all this time
I can't stop from loving you
You know we can't be friends
Can I taste your lips again?

Things that you say
I can't erase
Repeating days
It's all the same

We're all afraid of loneliness
We're all afraid to die alone
And even when you broke my heart
I'd do it again

You're looking right in my eyes
And you know that I'm lying
When I say that you're mine
And there's nobody else
But even when we fight
I can't stop from loving you
You know we can't be friends
Can I taste your lips again?

Things that you say
I can't erase
Repeating days
It's all the same

The day's repeating over again, (things that you say)
Hopelessly, we're over our heads. (I can't erase)
The day's repeating over again, (Repeating Days)
Hopelessly, we're over our heads. (It's all the same)

All I got
Is cheap wine
Do you mind?
All I got is love for you

All I've got
Cheap wines
Do you mind?
I will make time for you too

All I ask
Please don't lie
Cause this time
I won't come back home to you

Repeating days
Where we stayed
It's okay
Cause this time it's up to fade
