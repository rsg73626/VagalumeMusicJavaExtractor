LET'S NOT BE ALONE TONIGHT

Outside of the party where it's gettin too loud
It feels like we're the only ones alone in the crowd
Chat college and politics in time that we spend
You look back and you say
You think you lost all your friends
And I'm hoping that it's all my fault
Yea, I'm hoping that it's all my fault

Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)
No it don't, no it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)

Not wrong if you come on strong, cuz life is too short
I like how we get along like snow and New York
All good if you change your mind, you know where I stand
Look back and I say to you I lost all my friends
And I know you know it's all your fault
Yeah, I know you know it's all your fault

Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)
No it don't, no it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)

And I know it's gotta be my fault
Yea, I know it's gotta be my fault

La La La La La
La La La La La
Yeah
La La La La La
La La La La La
Yeah

And we might never feel the same
I'm just glad that you came
Am I right or is it all in my head?

Like Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)
Hey, no it don't, no it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, lets not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)

Hey, You don't have to be alone tonight
Hey, You don't have to be alone tonight
No it don't, no it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight
