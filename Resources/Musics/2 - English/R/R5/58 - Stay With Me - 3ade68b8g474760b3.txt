STAY WITH ME

Every morning after
I'm the same disaster
Every time is groundhog day

Tell me, have you moved on?
Am I just a sad song
Playing every night and day?

Say, "can you read between the lines I'm singing? "
Threw away the only chance I had with you
Maybe you're always be the one I'm missing
All I got left are the words that you said

Stay with me
Tonight
I want you to
Stay with me
Tonight

Got me on a bender
I'm the great pretender
Putting on a masquerade
But when the party's over
Alone and getting sober
Yeah, you got me wide awake

Say, "can you read between the lines I'm singing? "
Threw away the only chance I had with you
Maybe you're always be the one I'm missing
All I got left are the words that you said

Stay with me
Tonight
I want you to
Stay with me
Tonight
She said
Don't walk away
Leave what we could be behind
Don't leave me standing here
Don't say "not the time"
So
Stay with me
Tonight

Oh, oh
Can we go back, do it over?
Oh, oh
Can we go back to the start?

Say, "can you read between the lines I'm singing? "
(read between the lines I'm singing)

Stay with me
Tonight
I want you to
Stay with me
Tonight
She said
Don't walk away
Leave what we could be behind
Don't leave me standing here
Don't say "not the time"
So
Stay with me
Tonight

Every morning after
I'm the same disaster
Every time is groundhog day
