WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO

Listen
You've got them all hypnotized
Dragging them round by the eyes...ooooooo
They're lined up shoulder to shoulder
Like dominos you keep knonking them over

And all them fools got diamond rings
Just waiting for you (waiting for you)
And i can fool myself
But we both know it's true

Refrão
'cause you walk into the room
Girl you know you got it
Baby look around
You gotta lotta options
What do i have to do
What do i have to do

You're looking like a queen
Walking through the palace
Falling on my kness
Babe i'm losing balance
What do i have to do (ooooo)
To be the latest choice (oh, oh yea)

Your lips got me wondering why
I'm tangled in lame pick up lines (oh)
Something is taking over (something is taking over)
You got my heart set on rollercoaster

Im chasing you around you got
Your leash on me too (your leash on me too)
I wish that i could fool myself
But we both know it's true

Refrão

You're looking like a queen
Walking through the palace
Falling on my kness
Babe i'm losing balance
What do i have to do (ooooo)

See i will fly you to paris
I'll even learn the language
Vous avez des beaux yeux
Oo so beautiful

Climb the eiffel tower
Touch the moon and call it our, yeah
'cause it never shined as bright as you

When you walk into the room
I never had a chance
Tell me what do i have to do (what do i have to do )
What do i have to do

Refrão

You're looking like a queen
Walking through the palace
Falling on my kness
Babe i'm losing balance
What do i have to do (ooooo)
To be the latest choice (ooooo)
