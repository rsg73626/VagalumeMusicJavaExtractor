MY CONFESSION

When you see things in girls; physical attraction
(Oh oh oh oh x2)
I want you in my world; you'll be my addiction
(Oh oh oh oh x2)

I want it so bad
You're driving me mad
It's killing me more than you know, oh
The taste of your lips
The curve of your hips 
I think that I'm losing control, oh

I can't help myself
You are the mission
Are you in?
It's true; you're my obsession
I'm needing you
It's a condition
And I can't get through
That's my confession x3

I've seen a million girls none of them amaze me
(Oh oh oh oh x2)
Only when I'm close to you I start acting crazy
(Oh oh oh oh x2)

I want it so bad
You're driving me mad
It's killing me more than you know, oh

The taste of your lips
The curve of your hips 
I think that I'm losing control, oh
I can't help myself
You are the mission
Are you in?
It's true; you're my obsession
I'm needing you
It's a condition
And I can't get through
That's my confession x3

There's no one else I think about
It's something I can't live without
If wanting you is a crime,
Lock me up, I'll do my time 
I confess, I'm a mess 
Yeah, that's my confession 

When you see things in girls; physical attraction
I want you in my world; you'll be my addiction

I can't help myself
You are the mission
Are you in?
It's true; you're my obsession
I'm needing you
It's a condition
And I can't get through
That's my confession x3
