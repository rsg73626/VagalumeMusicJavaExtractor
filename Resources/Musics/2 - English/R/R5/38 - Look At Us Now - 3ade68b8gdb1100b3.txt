LOOK AT US NOW

Two years in the Golden State
Staying up and writing way too late
Everybody's always working 
Mom and Dad are always driving everywhere
Looking back at our life
It really makes you be aware

And don't think we ever forgot 
We know we're not more than a lot
This last year has gone so good 
Some of you may say we should

We've come so far from the past 
And they said we'd finish last
They just don't know how 
Look at us now (x2)

Walking on this long road 
People saying "never stop"
All the pain and the heartache is 
What took us to this spot

And, don't think we ever forgot (don't ya think) 
We know we're more than a lot (oh-oh)
This last year has gone so good 
Some of you may say we should

We're going all the way(x2)
Away, away. We're going all the..

We've come so far from the past 
And they said we'd finish last (x2)
They just don't know how 
Look at us now (x2)

We. We'll never forget (Who)
The reason why we've never given up (never given up)
If they try to get me down (Oh)
I won't let them, I'll never give in (Oh)

Away, we're going all the way
Going all the way
Look at us now (x2)

We've come so far from the past 
And they said we'd finish last
They just don't know how 
Look at us now (x2)

Look at us now
