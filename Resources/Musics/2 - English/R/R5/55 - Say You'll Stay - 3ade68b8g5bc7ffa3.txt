SAY YOU'LL STAY

Riker: it's summertime, 
And you are all that's on my mind, everyday
It seems like we, could stay up and talk through the night.
Oh what do you say?

Ross: say you'll stay (r5: hey-ey)
Heyy (r5:sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (r5: sta-ay)

No more running around, running around
(r5: no more running around, 
No no no, no more running around, no no no)
Running around,
When I'm around,
Just say you'll stay.

Riker: ramona's hair, (r5: ramona's hair)
She looks so cute in the clothes she wears. 
(rocky: yep, so cute man)
Her lips so sweet (r5: her lips so sweet)
And when I walk her to the door, I'm thinking,
Gee, just give me one more kiss I'm begging please.

Ross: say you'll stay (r5: hey-ey)
Heyy (r5:sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (r5: sta-ay)
No more running around, running around
(r5: no more running around, 
No no no, no more running around, no no no)
Running around,
When I'm around,
Just say you'll stay.

(r5: and who-oo)
Ross: knows, when we are together,
We never wanna go, oh-oh.
(r5: and you're not)
For any kind of weather.
I just need to know, to know,
That you,
You'll be, there,
Everytime I need you.

Ross: say you'll stay (r5: hey-ey)
Hey (r5:sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (r5: sta-ay)

No more running around

Say you'll stay (r5: hey-ey)
Hey (r5:sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (r5: sta-ay)

No more running around, running around
(r5: no more running around, 
No no no, no more running around, no no no)
Running around,
When I'm around,
Just say you'll stay
