ROCK THAT ROCK

Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
C'mon and rock that rock with me

Just sitting here and feeling like a zombie
Rock it up, let's just get it on
We can dance in the streets 'till midnight
Blood pumping to the beat of this song
We can run through the city
And the bright lights
Take a chance, living life on loud

Come over here
Come over here
You, me, now

We can rock it in the rain
Rock it on the beach
Rock it in the dock
Gonna rock it on repeat
Baby, baby
You and me (whoa)

We can rock it in the street
Rock out in the car
We all got the need to scream
Doesn't matter where we are
Baby, baby
Young and free
C'mon and rock that rock with me

Rock, rock
Baby
Rock, rock
Baby
Rock, rock
Baby
Rock, rock
C'mon and rock that rock with me

Get here!
Move a little faster
Can't wait, the night is young
(The night is young)
Turn it up, blowing all the speakers
Gonna party 'till we see the sun

Running crazy through the night
And the city lights
Take a chance living life so loud
Come over here
Come over here
Make it pop

We can rock it in the rain
Rock it on the beach
Rock it in the dock
Gonna rock it on repeat
Baby, baby
You and me (woah)

We can rock it in the street
Rock out in the car
We all got the need to scream
Doesn't matter where we are
Baby, baby
Young and free
C'mon and rock that rock with me

Rock, rock
Baby
Rock, rock
Rock it!

We can rock it in the rain
Rock it on the beach
Rock it in the dock
Gonna rock it on repeat
Baby, baby
You and me (woah)

We can rock it in the street
Rock out in the car
We all got the need to scream
Doesn't matter where we are
Baby, baby
Young and free
C'mon and rock that rock with me

Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
C'mon and rock that rock with me
