CALI GIRLS

Drop top, sitting next to Cee-Lo
Pacific coast highway
This happens every day

And our songs keep playing on the radio
Like 20 times a day
Man this is so crazy

Keep seein' pretty ladies walking 'round in high heels in La
What can I say?
Sexy shades, two piece, the girls are looking fine today
It?s getting hot you see

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls
Like the way they move
Love the things they do
Keep me up at night

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

Cali girls
Valley girls
Let me take you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

Oh, what I need

All kinds of model girls laying out at Venice Beach
The ones in magazines
They?re hanging out with me (they're hanging out with me)

And Katy Perry wasn?t lying when she told you (uh-huh)
You know them Cali girls,
They really rock my world oh

Short skirts, so hot, looking right in every way
What can I say?
Sexy shades, two piece, the girls are looking fine you say
It?s like this everyday

When you got Cali girls
Valley girls
Like the way they move
Love the things they do
Keep me up at night

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

Cali girls
Valley girls
Let me take you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

I can?t get those Cali girls out of my head
I can?t get those Cali girls out of my head

Cali girls
Valley girls
Like the way they move
Love the things they do
Keep me up at night

Cali girls
Valley girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

Cali girls
Valley girls
Let me take you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night

I like them Cali girls
Valley girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

Cali girls
Valley girls
Like the way they move
Love the things they do
Keep me up at night

I like them Cali girls

When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
