COULD HAVE BEEN MINE

(Mine...)

After all these years of trying
You think I would have a clue
But all that I've been looking for is you
Yeah

And I always have the worst to say
But with you I can hardly breath
I miss my tears and you're moving on
To someone else not me

Now my memories are hunting me
If I had said what I felt inside
You could've been mine
You could've been
Could've been
Could've been
Should have been mine

And I know that I'm not perfect
'Cause I can never read your mind
You can never call me Superman
I just wish I could turn back time
Woah

And you see me hurted
And you just watch me burn
If my life was up moving
Then I would get the girl

Now my memories are hunting me
If I had said what I felt inside
You could've been mine
You could've been
Could've been
Could've been
Should have been mine

(Could've been)
(Could've been mine)
You should've been mine
(Could've been)
(Should've been mine)
You should've been mine
(Could've been)
(Could've been mine)
You should've been
You could've been
Could've been mine

And I'm trying to move on from the long gone
But you keep coming back, coming back
It just keeps playing back like a rerun
I can't get you out of my head

Uuh

If I had said what I felt inside

You would've been mine
You would've been
You could've been
Should've been mine
Mine, mine

You could've been
You could've been
You could've been mine
(Mine)
