KEEP AWAY FROM THIS GIRL

Should've been runnin' a long long time ago
I should've seen it comin' Oh what happened? I don't know
This girl was all off track, ripped my heart right out from me
While laying on my back, when the poison came to me

All your lies with blackened skies, no way out
When you kill them with your eyes

She stole my heart and ripped it apart 
She left me stranded out in the dark
She's a bad girl woah 
And I was too, too foolish
She's runnin' round' all throught the town 
She's breaking hearts and tearing down
She's a bad girl woah 
And I was too, too foolish
Now I gotta keep away from this girl

She's like an addiction, the way she moves is so killing
The fault of her affection, and she bites with such a sting
Once she sinks her teeth in, you'll have no time to escape
Once her venim kicks in, then you're trapped no other way

All your lies with blackened skies, no way out
When you kill them with your eyes

She stole my heart and ripped it apart 
She left me stranded out in the dark
She's a bad girl woah 
And I was too, too foolish
She's runnin' round' all throught the town 
She's breaking hearts and tearing down
She's a bad girl woah 
And I was too, too foolish
Now I gotta keep away from this girl

You broke me down while I was leaning away, away
You still run around playing your games, 
Your games, your games

She stole my heart and ripped it apart 
She left me stranded out in the dark
She's a bad girl woah 
And I was too, too foolish
She's runnin' round' all throught the town 
She's breaking hearts and tearing down
She's a bad girl woah 
And I was too, too foolish
Now I gotta keep away from this girl
Now I gotta keep away from this girl
