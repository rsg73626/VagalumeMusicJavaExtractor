CRAZY 4 U

I played it safe,
I kept my foot up on the brake
I never really took a chance in life
And didn't live for today

Oh girl, and then I met you
Open my eyes to something new
You know you set me free like no one else
You got me acting a fool!

Don't you know you changed my life,
Girl, 'Cause now I'm livin'
And it feels so right, yeah

You got my heartbeat pumping
And it's going insane,
Got me jumping outta aeroplanes
Whoa

And that's why, why
I'm crazy, it's true,
Crazy for you.
You got me base jump livin'
And I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
Whoa
I can lie, lie
I'm crazy, it's true, crazy for you.

Midnight dipping in the pool
Or sneaking out up on the roof
You're unpredictable and girl that's what,
That's what I love about you

Don't you know you changed my life,
Girl, 'Cause now I'm livin'
And it feels so right, yeah

You got my heartbeat pumping
And it's going insane,
Got me jumping outta aeroplanes
Whoa

And that's why, why
I'm crazy, it's true,
Crazy for you.
You got me base jump livin'
And I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
Whoa
I can lie, lie
I'm crazy, it's true, crazy for you.

Well, I didn't lose my mind when I fell for you
(Without a parachute)
And I'm gonna love you girl like you never knew

Oh

Don't you know you changed my life,
Girl, 'Cause now I'm livin'
And it feels so right, yeaaa

You got my heartbeat pumping
And it's going insane,
Got me jumping outta aeroplanes
Whoa

And that's why, why
I'm crazy, it's true,
Crazy for you.
You got me base jump livin'
And I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
Whoa

I can lie, lie
I'm crazy, it's true, crazy for you.
I'm crazy, it's true,
Crazy for you.
