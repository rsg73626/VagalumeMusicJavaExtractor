NEVER

Outside it's pouring Rain as I watch you walk by 
Outside my window and see your smile glow
I run downstairs fast as I can 
I walk outside and take your hand and we danced 
our shadows moving in the dark we go round in circles 
you look at me lights up my heart
I'm hoping this moment lasts forever 
you touch my face and tell me never

Never will I let you go Baby know I love you so

I'll be right here by your side 
It's gonna be a heck of a ride

You can count on me to be there 
for you no one can take your place

You're my one and only sweet heart 
And I will never tear us apart

Never will I let you go

My hair is damp and it's so cold you take your jacket off 
to warm me 
I feel a slight breeze
The pavement has a special shine and here 
I'm wishing we could stop time or maybe rewind
You walk in close to me The rains fading away
You hold my hand in peace so glad you're here to stay

You know, That I need you

I know, That you need me

There's no place I'd rather be
