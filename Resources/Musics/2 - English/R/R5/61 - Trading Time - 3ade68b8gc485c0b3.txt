TRADING TIME

Oh, girl, I'm tired of these nights, they come and go, yeah
Oh, love, I wonder what you like and what you know, yeah
I been catching these feelings
side effects of the weekend
We should take it slow

'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
Leave the lights on, drink these bottles
It's just us until tomorrow
'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night

Ooh, girl, I think we're just foolish by design, yeah
Ooh, love, I don't intend to get caught up in lies, no
Don't know what I believe in
praise your body on Jesus
We can take it slow

'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
Leave the lights on, drink these bottles
It's just us until tomorrow
'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night

When you move it like that, I can't ever go back
Keep it moving like that
When you move it like that, I can't ever go back
When you move it like that

'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
Leave the lights on, drink these bottles
It's just us until tomorrow
'Cause we're just trading time
You can stay all night
You can stay all night, all night
