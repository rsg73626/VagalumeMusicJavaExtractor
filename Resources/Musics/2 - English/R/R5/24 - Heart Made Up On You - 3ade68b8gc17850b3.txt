HEART MADE UP ON YOU

Got my heart made up on you
ooh, ooh, ooh

you said what you said
when  words are knives 
it's not to forget
but something in my head my wouldn't set
can't give up on us yet,no 
no, wo-oh
your love was so real
it pulled me in just like a magnetic field
I'd let you go but something's taking the wheel
yeah it's taking the wheel
oh, wo-oh

my mind says, no you're not good for me
you're not good but my heart's made up on you
my body  can't take what you give to me
 Got my heart made up on you
wo-ooh, wo-ooh
got my heart made up on you

'I should be making a break
upon all night thinking I'm planning my escape
but this isomnia  I ain't going nowhere
and now I'm back at your place
oh, no

my mind says, no you're not good for me
you're not good but my heart's made up on you
my body  can't take what you give to me
what you give, to me
got my heart made up on you
wo-ooh, wo-ooh
got my heart made up on you

look what you did, what you did
what you're doing to me
you got me searching for the words, like a silent movie
l can't breathe, I can't see
it's so out of control
but baby honestly my hands are up
I'm letting go go go go go go 

 Got my heart made up on you

my mind says, no you're not good for me
you're not good but my heart's made up on you
my body  can't take what you give to me
what you give, to me
got my heart made up on you
wo-ooh, wo-ooh
got my heart made up on you

my mind says no
got my heart made up on you
up on you, up on you
