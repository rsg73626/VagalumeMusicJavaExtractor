RED VELVET

I keep telling 'em too
I keep telling 'em

She likes to make me think that I'm a freak
just for her velvet
All wrapped up in between her ivory and I can't help it
Listening to Novacane, Ocean on repeat again
Oh baby, you were worth the wait, baby
you were worth the wait

When you're wearing velvet, girl
Takes me to another world
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way
Feel this way

She's making deals, I'm in her ear
and getting overzealous
We're swimming in her velvet, damn
Makes all her neighbors jealous
Listening to Purple Rain, crying over jobs again
Oh baby, you were worth the wait, baby
you were worth the wait

When you're wearing velvet, girl
Takes me to another world
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way (oh)
Feel this way

Let me tell you 'bout my girl, uh
She a boss lady, female dictatorship
She make other models look like tater chips
Ask me if I dig her style, eyes, legs and lips
I'd have to say yes, yes I do and hell yes
Brain amazing, she even dig Hendrix
Hit me in my deep blue, heart beats reckless
In the bedroom, wanna touch her every freckle
I hit her from the bass and I let her scream treble


Nobody makes me feel this way
Feel this way, yeah

Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way
Nobody makes me feel this way (oh)
Feel this way

Yeah, baby
Listening to Novacane, Ocean on repeat again
You know you make me feel like a whole new man
Listening to Purple Rain, Prince is on repeat again
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
