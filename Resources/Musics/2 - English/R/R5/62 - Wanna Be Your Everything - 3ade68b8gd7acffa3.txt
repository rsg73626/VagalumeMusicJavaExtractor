WANNA BE YOUR EVERYTHING

Oh
Your eyes light up the sky
I know you won't fade away
I know this couldn't fade

See I gotta tell you girl,
There's nothing quite like you
I love the things you do
I think I'm falling head over heels
'Cause You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything
You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything

Ohh
Wanna be your everything
When we're staring face to face,
Against those perfect lips,
I love the way you taste

And every time we touch,
I drift away
I'm not the same
I think I'm falling head over heels
You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything
You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything
You're all I'm dreaming of

You're all I'm thinking of
You're everything, everything
I'll be all that I can be
I'll be your everything,

Yeah, everything
You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything
You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything
You're all I want, all I need

And I,
Wanna be your everything

Ohh
Wanna be your everything

Ohh
Wanna be your everything
