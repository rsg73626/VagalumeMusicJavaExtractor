CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU

You knock me off of my feet
Can hardly breath
When you're around me I feel the heat
You steam up the mirrors
And make me shift gears
Sometimes I can't think all that clear

I'm loosing sleep
I'm counting sheep like
1,2,3, let's go

You hypnotize me
You mesmerize me
Way-o way-o
Way over my head and I don't know what to do
?Cause I can't get enough of you

See girl you're like an equation
And I'm not good at math
You're very confusing
My hearts in a trap
I don't see your signs
Or see through the lines
And I just can't understand your mind

I'm loosing sleep
I'm counting sheep like
1,2,3, let's go

You hypnotize me (yes you do)
You mesmerize me
Way-o way-o
Way over my head and I don't know what to do
?Cause I can't get enough of you (way-o)

You hypnotize me (yes you do)
You mesmerize me (way-o)
Way-o way-o
Way over my head and I don't know what to do
?Cause I can't get enough of you
