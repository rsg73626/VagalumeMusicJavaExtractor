FALLIN' FOR YOU

You like mismatched socks with polka dots
You like your pizza cold; I think that's hot
You like to swim at night when the moon is full
You think that makes you strange; I think that's cool

And you say, you're scared
But I would be there
Baby, I swear
I'm not going anywhere

You can change your hair five times a week
You can change your name
Get a little bit crazy
You can dance in the rain
Rockin' secondhand chic
But I live for the day that I'm calling you baby

Cause I'm falling for you
For everything that you do
Baby, I'm falling for you
You might be crazy
But baby, I'm falling for you

I'd take predictable and bare naked
And all the mannequins; they look the same
There's no one else like you; one of a kind
And I'm a lucky guy ‘cause you're all mine

And you say, you're scared
But I would be there
Baby, I swear
I'm not going anywhere

You can change your hair five times a week
You can change your name
Get a little bit crazy
You can dance in the rain
Rockin' secondhand chic
But I live for the day that I'm calling you baby

Cause I'm falling for you
For everything that you do
Baby, I'm falling for you
You might be crazy
But baby, I'm falling for you

I don't care what people say
I just love you anyway
It's me and you against the world
(you got me falling girl)
I don't care what people say
I just love you anyway
Me and you against the world
‘Cause I'm falling for you
Falling for you

You can change your hair five times a week
You can change your name
Get a little bit crazy
You can dance in the rain
Rockin secondhand chic
But I live for the day that I'm calling you baby

‘Cause I'm falling for you
For everything that you do
Baby, I'm falling for you
You might be crazy
But baby, I'm falling for you

Yeah
Falling, I'm falling for you
Yeah
You might be crazy
But baby I'm falling for you
