AMERICAN DREAM

Big money, why you say
I'm off up in this thang
I'm always party for the party cause the crooked show up late
Nigger classing like a atari matter of fact like '88
Keep the baddest bitches with me
Cause it lets me see who hate
Fucking hate, fucking great, ' dick '
I got money, I got plenty, wanna share get a plate
See we straight over here rocking chicks from every where
' I'm the freshest thing that's out
The flyest thing that in
See I be on that polo '
Y'all blowing on the loud,
I'm blowing in the wind
So if y'all niggers the losers
Well I guess that mean I win, out

American dream, I am bout cream
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen, sherlie sheen
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen

' in the back of the beamer, getting laid
I'm a motherfucking renegade
Y'all should be very afraid
Cause I bring them hell for heaven's sake
Can we all ' let's pop some bottles celebrate
While I get dough like collection plate
Fuck I really seen here, haters getting jealous
' green light status
The meanest, toughest, baddest yea
You should call me show no
So I ain't shit you can tell us
You can hear him yelling oh fuck
Party ain't a party tell me and my brothers show up
5, 4, 3, 2 we about to blow up
You know what, hold up
Tiger blood inside my veins, you know I'm about to go nuts

American dream, I am bout cream
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen, sherlie sheen
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen

' she said she want shots
' I'm the truth ' don't believe me
Motherfucker, you a sucker,
I could tell I never love them
I just fuck them, give them nothing
It ain't tricking if you got it,
'stupid like my '
'is the chronic, doggy style when I be riding
I'm a problem'so I told my label'
I'm the truth no substitiutions'
I'm so cookie, I'm so lupe'
So I guess that I'm amazing, right

American dream, I am bout cream
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen, sherlie sheen
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen
American dream, I am bout cream
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen, sherlie sheen
About winning, charlie sheen
Big things, tv screens
I'm about winning, charlie sheen
