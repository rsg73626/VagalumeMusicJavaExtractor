WE ON

Shawty on the floor shit, wanna go down
When I?m in the club scene, you know we?re going down,
I know these girls, just wanna have fun!
Shawty is a freaky, I?ll do the?
?home, girl, ?
... so high, but so am mi,
Packing this weapon that go boom, bye, bye!

Chorus:
We are, yeah we are, yeah we are and we are!
And we?d be standing from the top,
Laughing at you haters while we keep going on, yeah
Up like elevators (we are, yeah we are, yeah we are), yeah!
Don?t sit in the vip, yeah!
Bottles in the air, is popping over here ?

The freaks come out, out on night,
They know what I want, they got just what I got.
When you?re dropping down, down, down, down,
Cause girl you got that bum, bum, bum
I tell ?em I?m not ready?
... the boys, about to take over the game,
... looking flat in a plane,
You know who we are, don?t even have to say our name,

Chorus:
We are, yeah we are, yeah we are and we are!
And we?d be standing from the top,
Laughing at you haters while we keep going on, yeah

Don?t sit in the vip, yeah!
Bottles in the air, is popping over here ?
