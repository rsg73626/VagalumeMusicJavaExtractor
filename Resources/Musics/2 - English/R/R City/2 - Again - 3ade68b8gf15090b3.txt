AGAIN

You in the crib with ya shades on
Hiding ya tears from me
Cause you know I'm bout to say I gotta leave ya
You're going through it now
I can't be there for ya
I gotta hustle everyday my babies need sum'n
And they ain't gon struggle like how
Me and my brother struggle
Rihanna call she need a hit I gotta give it to her
If I don't hit these streets then we don't eat it's just like that
So everyday I'm out here finding ways to get that check

So all day
And all night
I'm out here
On my grind

I'll be gone by the morning
Let's just stay here till then
Hold me like it's the last time
You'll ever see me again
I'm leaving on an airplane
Don't you ask me till when
Hold me like its the last time
You'll ever see me again

I got my car full of gas money in my bag
On the road to riches Shawty cause I never had
And you don't want me on the corner hustlin' (hustlin)
But a 9 to 5 ain't finna' get us nothing (nothing)
That's why I be going as hard as I have to
Cause if we don't start living this world'll fly right pass ya
And I keep hearing sum'n better calling
Can't get it if all I'm doing is talking

So all day (all day)
And all night (all night)
I'm out here (I'm out here)
On my grind

I'll be gone by the morning
Let's just stay here till then
Hold me like its the last time
You'll ever see me again
I'm leaving on an airplane
Don't you ask me till when
Hold me like its the last time
You'll ever see me again

I'll be gone by the morning
Let's just stay here till then
Just hold me like its the last time
You'll ever see me again
I'm leaving on an airplane
So don't you ask me till when
And no this isn't the last time
You'll ever see me again
You'll ever see me again
