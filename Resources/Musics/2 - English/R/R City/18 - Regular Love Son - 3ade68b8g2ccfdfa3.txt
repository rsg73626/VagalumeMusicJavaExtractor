REGULAR LOVE SON

Every day it seems like what close do I...
I think that you and me should stop pretending
Going over and over the same thing
And I don't think that you and me
Are gonna make it anymore, no
'Cause now I know we hit all time long
And the only thing I can get me though is...

Chorus:
A regular love song
Something to hear on the radio
Something to play on my heart part
Take my my mind of a broken heart.
Just a radio love song
Something to see in the video
Something to date with, put in a movie
When the guy gets the girl
Just a regular love song.
Something like tarararata, tarararata, tarararata
Just a regular love song.

The only thing to take my mind of for me and your heart love
And I don't think that you and me
Are gonna make it anymore, no
'Cause now I know we hit all time long
And the only thing I can get me though is...

[Chorus:]
'Cause when I'm at home and you're gone
I need a song that can make smile again
Take me higher and you know what that is.

[2 x chorus:]
Something like tarararata, tarararata
Just a regular love song
