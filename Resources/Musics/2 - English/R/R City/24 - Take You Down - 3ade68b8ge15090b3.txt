TAKE YOU DOWN

All that I want is a gyal that's bad to the bone
Long black hair, caramel skin tone
Meet her in the club after that take her home
And give it to her all night long
Now rock your hips from left to right
Love when you move I know you busty whine
Just know you sleeping in my bed tonight
Girl if that's alright
Could you whine like this
Would you move like that?
Make me push it all
'Cause you fling it back, back, back
You have? hundred worlds exact
I just wanna touch
Girl because you're perfect
Don't be shy, I know you want the same thing
I want tonight, want tonight
Hold on tight, baby you know you in for a real good ride, so
Tonight I'm gonna take you down, down
Come put your arms around me
Oh girl, I'm gonna lay you down, down
And make you feel iry
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you whole, all your kids
Kiss you, girl no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you whole, all your kids
Kiss you, girl no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Girl your but unslimed
But your backside long
Take it down to the groudd and
Push it back right now, now, now
From time you walk in
Shut the whole place down
Sexiest gyal around
Should be wearing a gon, gon, gone
Don't be shy, I know you want the same thing
I want tonight, want tonight
Hold on tight, baby you know you in for a real good ride, so
Tonight I'm gonna take you down, down
Come put your arms around me
Oh girl, I'm gonna lay you down, down
And make you feel iry
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you whole, all your kids
Kiss you, girl no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
Touch your face, feel your love
Love you whole, all your kids
Kiss you, girl no pressure
Tonight I'm gonna take you down
You know what this is and what I came to do
Take you with me back to my room
Make you hot, girl you know, get you up
Out your clothes
It's not, it's not enough time in a day
For me to give you what you need
I hope you hear what I wanna say Ã¢e? cause
Tonight I'm gonna take you down, down
Come put your arms around me
Oh girl, I'm gonna lay you down, down
And make you feel iry

Touch your face, feel your love
Love you whole, all your kids
Kiss you, girl no pressure
