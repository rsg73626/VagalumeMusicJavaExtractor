SHE DA BEST

Miss independent, shwaty doing her own thing,
Got... lil momma in her own...
You can't compare to other girls that are,
Cute in her face,... she's hot!
I mean she really got me,
Just for walking this earth, I feel she should get paid!
Do, do, do your thing baby,
Don't stop with what you're doing,
Forget what other girls say,
All their doing is hey, ey!
Uhuu momma bad, bad to the bone,
A million other, but the only one I notice is only you!
Yeah!

Chorus:
She's making all the fellows wanna stare
Cause when she comes around the other girls disappear!
Oh, yeah! I say shwaty you're the best!
Oh, yeah!
And is you who want them other girls fail,
Even when I'm... they gotta stay clear
Shwaty you're the best, oh yeah!
I say shwaty you're the best! oh, yeah!

Six forty five is the time on her wrist watch,
But is more like the... that she got,
... all we do is see...
Momma... style you gotta see her to believe it!
The type of girl that every man wants,
Is shwaty a bomb? she really got it going on!
And I just gotta have her!
She's so thick like she come from atlanta.
Oh shit! I'm telling you, uhuu momma bad, bad to the bone,
A million other girls, but the only one I notice is you!
Yeah! only you! yeah!
