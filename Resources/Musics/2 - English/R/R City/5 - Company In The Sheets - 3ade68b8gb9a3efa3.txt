COMPANY IN THE SHEETS

If you think that you’re the only one, you’re fool
I got a surprise, I hope that you’re ready
I wanna introduce someone to you
He’s a little friend of mine that helps when I’m lonely
While you’re over there behind her like a quarterback
I’ll be over here waiting at your back…
So don’t you worry baby I’m alright
I found somebody to be by my side
Cause if you’re gonna hurt me,
I’m gonna hurt you back
We can go tip or tap
You wanna take it back so that I’ll take you back
You made your bed now lay in it
You should of thought of that
Before you went all of that
And … someone that
Cause baby you never took none of my warnings
So I wanna ask you something

So now that I’m gone, who’ll keep you warm?
I see that I’m fed up and I’m ready to get up
Now you never meant me no harm
Suddenly I’m what you want
It will be easy out from here
Once you leave guess I’ll find somebody
To keep me company in the sheets

If you think that you’re the only one, you’re fool
I got a surprise, I hope that you’re ready
You thought when I’ll find out that I’ll be cool
Well I got something to tell you
You’re not the only one who’s unfaithful
Now you would say I’ve been sleeping with the enemy
But your best friend he’s been being very friendly
All you see it doesn’t feel that good
When the shoe is on the other foot
You think that you’re gonna hurt me
And I’m not gonna hurt you back
We can go tip or tap
You wanna take it back so that I’ll take you back
You made your bed now lay in it
You should of thought of that
Before you went all of that
And … someone that
Cause baby you never took none of my warnings
So I wanna ask you something

So now that I’m gone, who’ll keep you warm?
I see that I’m fed up and I’m ready to get up
Now you never meant me no harm
Suddenly I’m what you want
It will be easy out from here
Once you leave guess I’ll find somebody
To keep me company in the sheets

None of those … I’m talking
Your bed is so empty
I know that you wish that you’re coming home to me
None of your phones is ringing
Where’s the competition
You needed to have when you were with me

So now that I’m gone, who’ll keep you warm?
I see that I’m fed up and I’m ready to get up
Now you never meant me no harm
Suddenly I’m what you want
It will be easy out from here
Once you leave guess I’ll find somebody
To keep me company in the sheets
If you think that you’re the only one, you’re fool
I wanna introduce someone to you.
