ONLY YOURS

Why are the women I am inviting
Making me so hard to fight them
All of them want the loving
All of them want me to wipe them
Baby girl I will never leave you
I will never give them none of my time
Baby girl I will never sleep around
Cause I am so proud to call you mine
All I need is you I don't need no one
I f I can't be with you I rather be by myself
Girl you are the only one my love for you won't die
I give you my heart and...
One chance is all I need girl to let you see
I am only yours I am only yours
Now girl they are... but they can't break me
I am only yours I am only yours
I am only yours I am only yours

To all my girls around the world
All I see is you girl
Girl is just you
I don't want no other girl by my side
Are you the only girl who lights me up inside
All I need is you I don't need no one
I f I can't be with you I rather be by myself
Girl you are the only one my love for you won't die
I give you my heart and...
One chance is all I need girl to let you see
I am only yours I am only yours
Now girl they are... but they can't break me
I am only yours I am only yours
I am only yours I am only yours
Why are the women I am inviting
Making me so hard to fight them
All of them want the loving
All of them want me to wipe them
Baby girl I will never leave you
I will never give them none of my time
Baby girl I will never sleep around
Cause I am so proud to call you mine
All I need is you I don't need no one
I f I can't be with you I rather be by myself
Girl you are the only one my love for you won't die
