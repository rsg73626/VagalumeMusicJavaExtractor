NOT FAIR

From the first time we’ve met
I just couldn’t forget I want it to give you everything
But kid of my heart eave the other girl alone
I thought that it was something wrong with me
Hold on you know and I know it wasn’t ready then baby
..can know can never convinces to change the pase baby
We would up, cut up shut up slow down for a minute
‘cause all our friends that we would …..and

Is just not fair I don’t see how we could it be up the high yeah
Is just not fair if that I find the love the one it disappear
Is just not fair I thought it would last is just something that would last .it’s crazy
Love so strong she didn’t go so long, is just not fair

Tell e mi kiss in heart I thought that we better than that ..keeep pushing your buttons
And everyone keep sayin . I wish we can take it back
Is it in the price

We would up, cut up shut up slow down for a minute
‘cause all our friends that we would …..and

Is just not fair I don’t see how we could it be up the high yeah
Is just not fair if that I find the love the one it disappear
Is just not fair I thought it would last is just something that would last it’s crazy
Love so strong she didn’t go so long, is just not fair

Don’t you hate it when you think you got the world
And overtime you see that you don’t have none
You stick it up cause you don’t wanna be the only
… just walk around here lonely
And it feel like you’re not gonna make it
Looking for love and all the wrong places
All your friends …

Is just not fair I don’t see how we could it be up the high yeah
Is just not fair if that I find the love the one it disappear
Is just not fair I thought it would last is just something that would last it’s crazy
Love so strong she didn’t go so long, is just not fair
