And am trying not to look,
But it's oh, so hard.
Cos see, she's walking with a man,
But, oh my god,
I really think am gonna steal her away

They both look so like.
But that's all right.
Cos see, she's gonna be mine,
By the end of the night.
And if he knew my thoughts,
So he would not like me.
Cos I think she's gonna leave him with me, aay.

A crook, a criminal, criminal, oooh.
