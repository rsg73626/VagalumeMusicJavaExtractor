SAVE MY SOUL

I'm feeling like I can kill a man
I'm feeling like I don't give a damn
But I mean could you blame me
Oh maybe I'm just going crazy
I feel like I've seen everything
I still don't believe in anything
Is like my mind won't let me
Oh right now I feel so empty

So you can have my heart I won't be needing that now
(I know that)
Take my body just break it down to the bones
(Fa sho that)
I need somebody to help me right my wrongs
(Ya know that)
So go ahead and take whatever you want

But save my soul, save my soul
When I lose my mind and I lose control
Save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
From my highest high to my lowest low
Lord save my soul

Well I'm a sinner oh yes I know
Before my sins become unforgivable
I'd admit that I'm guilty
Oh I pray the lord could forgive me, oh-o
Cause I'm a rebel without a cause
Breaking every law
I wish somebody could help me
Right now I just feel empty, oh-o

So you can have my heart I won't be needing that now
(I know that)
Take my body just break it down to the bones
(Fa sho that)
I need somebody to help me right my wrongs
(Ya know that)
So go ahead and take whatever you want

But save my soul, save my soul
When I lose my mind and I lose control
Save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
From my highest high to my lowest low
Lord save my soul

Why is everything bad for me always feel so good
I'm not all the way crazy oh I'm just misunderstood
I know I should do better but this is all I know
Why is it no matter what I get I'm never satisfied
People tell me I'm doing wrong but it feel so right
I know I should do better but this is all I know

Save my soul, save my soul
When I lose my mind and I lose control
Save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
From my highest high to my lowest low
Lord save my soul
