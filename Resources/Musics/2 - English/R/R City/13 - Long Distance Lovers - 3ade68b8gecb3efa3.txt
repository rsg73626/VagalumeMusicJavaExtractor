LONG DISTANCE LOVERS

… I’m not sure how to say
I want him, he wants me
Come here close, take me with
Read my eyes,
I have never felt the way I feel
Right now with him
I wish that he could me tell me
What it feels like!

…in the distance, nobody…
The lovers go.. and it’s so as it started,
See the look in his eyes,
See the look in mine at the moment when…
And we became long distance lovers, oh, oh!
And … love undiscovered, oh, oh, oh!
And we never found words to…
Touch and a kiss, nothing like this,
Long distance lovers, oh!

Cross the shores, cross the skies,
Touch these lips, touch my bodies,
All I want… tonight
..ain’t a crime to treat me passion…
So I don’t know why I want him so mine!

…in the distance, nobody…
The lovers go.. and it’s so as it started,
See the look in his eyes,
See the look in mine at the moment when…
And we became long distance lovers, oh, oh!
And … love undiscovered, oh, oh, oh!
And we never found words to…
Touch and a kiss, nothing like this,
Long distance lovers, oh!

Long distance, la, la, la!
Long distance, la, la, la!
Long distance, la, la, la!
Long distance, la, la, la!

And we became long distance lovers, oh, oh!
And … love undiscovered, oh, oh, oh!
And we never found words to…
Touch and a kiss, nothing like this,
Long distance lovers, oh!
