SLAVE TO THE DOLLAR

I'm a slave to the dollar
To the dollar, to the dollar
Rock City
Right About Now

I'm a slave to the dollar
Man ah man never had that's why we die for the dollar
(Yea-aye)
Cheat and rob and lie for the dollar (whoa-oh)
Just let it kill dem kill dem all it kill dem

Ugh, spending this bread getting to my head
Fuck what yall said man I want a lot of money
Every red cent that I go get
I ain't gon lie man it make these hoes love me
I ain't had nothing if I ever want something
I'mma have to go get it and I just might buss it
Buss it buss it buss it buss it buss it
(woo hey huuh)
They all got a problem when you came from the bottom
And ya moved in their building
then they asking you some questions
See it's alright when ya skin lil light
But they really don't like when you're my complexion
I don't really care I just let lil man swing
On top the chandeliers and I wish they say sum'n
Sum'n sum'n sum'n sum'n yuh can't do me nothing wah
You need a couple hundreds just to get a couple grand
Cause you wanna make a milli

Anybody tell you it's the root of all evil

Whether wrong or right man ya better just spend it
Spend it spend it spend it spend it
Ya can't take it with ya better spend it

For them hoes guess I'm a slave to the women
Pull up to the club with me and all my niggas
So whoever's at the front better not be trippin trippin
Trippin you just a door man mufucka stop trippin (woo)
Liste, first class flight different girl every night
Least once in my life I can say that I did it
Living in the hood and you're broke
so ya move that dope
Now the police paying you a visit
Work real hard still can't get job
One way or the other mufucka I'ma get it get it get it
Either I'ma die trying or I'ma get it forget it
Raised in the trap but I made it out of that
And I ain't looking back nigga I ain't stopping
