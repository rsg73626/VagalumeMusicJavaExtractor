FALLING HARD

I'm not too proud to get to high
Go out all night with you by my side
I don't care where we go
Don't care if I'm alone when it's over
I'm not alive if I'm too comfortable
So numb, I can't see what's beautiful
I want a little bit
A taste of what could happen when you get closer

I'm falling hard, falling hard, falling
I don't know if you feel it, too
Don't stop giving me devotion
Let's get caught up in emotion

Don't need to play pretend with me
I won't waste your time with shallow things
There's not a word to say to make me run away
So just pull me closer

I'm falling hard, falling hard for you
I know if you feel it, too
Don't stop giving me devotion
Let's get caught up in emotion
I'm falling hard, falling hard for you
I know if you feel it, too
Don't stop giving me devotion
Let's get caught up in emotion

I'm not too proud to get to high
Go out all night with you by my side
I don't care where we go
Don't care if I'm alone when it's over
I'm not alive if I'm too comfortable
So numb, I can't see what's beautiful
I want a little bit
A taste of what could happen when you get closer

I'm falling hard, falling hard for you
I know if you feel it, too
Don't stop giving me devotion
Let's get caught up in emotion
