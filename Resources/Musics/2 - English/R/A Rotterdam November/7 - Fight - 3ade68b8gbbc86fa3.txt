FIGHT

Verse: You don't fool me, whenever you're around.
You put on a show, as if hope is to be found.

You don't fool me, whenever you're around.

Pre-Chorus: The cat's out of the bag, loneliness
is all you have, when the world tells who you are,
learn to fight back

Chorus:
Fight, fight, fight like you're dying. Breathe, breathe,
won't you, won't you breathe. No matter what
happens tonight, you've gotta wake up in the morning
and fight

If I were drowning, would you see my hand break the surface?

If this were an S.O.S., would you ever get this?

Replace your mirror with, with a window - it's the only
salvation from, from the shallow
