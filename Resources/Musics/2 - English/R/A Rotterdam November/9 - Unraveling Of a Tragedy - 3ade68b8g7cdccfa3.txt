UNRAVELING OF A TRAGEDY

I'm looking at a mirror. Tears roll down my face.
Two dark eyes stare back at me, they tell the story
of a past I can't erase.
God, I come before you. My life is shattered glass.
I wish I had more for you, but unfortunately, this is
all I've got left.
Chorus:
I can't let go, no I cannot forgive, I hate the man
living inside my skin. In bloody fields and dirty
hands many more tragedies lie within.
I'd rather feel pain, just to feel again. It's been so long, I actually don't remember how much my
chains weigh.
I may be breathing, but don't for once think I'm
alive. I may have even dreamed once, but all trace
of that is gone from inside my eyes.
Chorus
Bridge:
Do you think you could send the rain, to wash me
clean, turn the battlefields green again.
I can't let go, no I cannot forgive, I hate the man
living inside my skin. In bloody fields and dirty
hands many more miracles lie within.
