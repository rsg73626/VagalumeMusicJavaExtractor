ENOUGH (THE END)

You know I, I'm scared to feel this
You knew where I am
You know what I want, I'm lost
I'm so lost and so scared
I found true meaning
Yes, found me so lost and so scared tonight

All that I wanted and all that I needed
Just take my heartache and break it
And you're what I want, yes you're what I need
is my life taken for granted?

Again... I feel like a can't run,
like I can't heal
And I know I want to come here again, with your case

Just tell me when the clouds will break..
the moon will shine and break free tonight

All that I wanted and all that I needed
Just take my heartache and break it
And you're what I want, yes you're what I need..
Is my life taken for granted?
All that I wanted and all that I needed
Is your life, precated in weakness
And you, you lost it all for me
And I just... repaid you in pain in grief.

You're the light
Uncover the lies
Turn on the lights
Uncover the lies... (oh the lies)

All that I wanted and all that I needed
Is your life, precated in weakness
And you, you lost it all for me
And I just... repaid you in pain in grief
All you wanted and all you needed
Was my tone precated for life
don't you take it and don't you break it
Just tell me you hate it
(cuz)I know you're lost tonight
