CITY WITHOUT A HEART

Verse:

The sky was blue yesterday, but today,
it's turned to the darkest shade of grey.
Oh,oh,oh I walk the streets of a
European ghost town.

Interlude:

When will we, be assured? I feel so
empty. When will we be understood?
Somethings broken here. It's gotta be.

Chorus:

I don't want to live my life thinking and
pacing. I don't want to say goodbye to
all feeling. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh.

Verse 2:

Once people talked amongst these
markets. But now, the cobblestone is
all alone. Oh, oh, oh, these fires have
burned to a few embers.

Bridge:

We could rebuild this city without a
heart. This isn't hopeless. City
without a heart. After all that's gone
wrong, City without a heart,I'm
stronger than a bunch of
bombs, City without a heart. These
were our dreams once,
what looks like piles of ashes. The fires
of destruction burn hot. But not as hot
as my passions.

Chorus:

Chorus2:
I don't want to give up now. We've
come so far. You can't do this alone,
I don't care who you are.
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh.

Bridge continued:

Resurrect these buildings, let the
melodies ring. Set the captives free,
set the captives free. We could rebuild
this city without a heart. We could
rebuild this city without a heart.
