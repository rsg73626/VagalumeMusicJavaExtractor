THE FALL

Youve got your hands around my throat 
Afraid of the words that I might say 
And with my one last dying breath 
I will pull you down with me 
To the bottom 

(We will fall) 
We will fall violently asleep 
Two lovers holding on to something that could never be 
(We will fall) 
And all the lies and the deceit 
Will disappear with the defeat 
Of you and me 

From the start I already knew 
That I had no real feelings for you 
Im just a lazy, low-life tool 
Determined to make a fool out of you 
And I did 

We will fall 
We will fall 

And I have no regrets 
I got what I wanted 
I could care less regarding 
How youre feeling now 
And if youd just ask 
Is there another girl? 
Id tell that shes flying in tonight 

We will fall violently asleep 
Two lovers holding on to something that could never be 
(We will fall) 
And all the lies and the deceit 
Will disappear with the defeat 
Of you and me
