LAST NIGHT

I have yet to understand 
The thoughts that rest inside your head 

Ive missed this feeling 
So long has it been vacant from me 
A sense of urgency swells up 
And makes my whole body sore 
I want to be surrounded by your presence 
Cause this ailing boy is in need of a cure 

Last night I longed for something more 
Last night I kept my hands by my side 

Last night 
I watched you drift away helplessly 
Without 
Even knowing if you would return 
This morning 
I called for you to see if you would respond to me 
I was feeling like an old pair of shoes 
Worn out, hollow, and tearing at the seams 

Take it slow 
Isnt that what you want? 
Or am I wasting my time 
I dont know 
The difference in the words 
That you contrast they all run into one color 
My minds not that abstract 
Please tell me dear 
The meaning behind this piece that you are painting 
How should I react to the implied lines 
Right around the spot where your heart should go 

Last night I watched you drift 
Last night I watched helplessly 
Without even knowing if you would return to me 
This morning I called for you to see if you would respond to me 
But Im beginning to feel like this was all for nothing 

Last night I longed for something more 
Last night
