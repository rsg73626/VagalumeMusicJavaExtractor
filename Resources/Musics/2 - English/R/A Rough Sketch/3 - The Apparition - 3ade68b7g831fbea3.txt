THE APPARITION

You appear to me an apparition 
That I long to hold 
When you have me hanging 
On every word 
And mine holding to the tip of my tongue 

So Ill marvel at the space that you create 
And trace the lines when you leave 

The silk of your skin it 
Fades between my fingers and 
This city is broken without you here 
Its just such a shame 
That you have to be selfish 
Because your killing me 

So Ill stand miles away from your loneliness 
As you build...build your walls 
Because my hands are too sore to fight anymore 
Why wont you let me in? 
Why won't you let me in? 

The silk of your skin it 
Fades between my fingers and 
This city is broken without you here 
Its just such a shame 
That you have to be selfish 
Because its killing me 

So take all of your words and tear into me 
And Ill become a ghost because it will bring 
Me closer to you 

It takes all of me just to keep on breathing 
Ive tried to 
Ive tried to forget about you 
Ive tried 
Ive tried
