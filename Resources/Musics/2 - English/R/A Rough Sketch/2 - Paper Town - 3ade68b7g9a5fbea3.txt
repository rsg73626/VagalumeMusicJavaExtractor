PAPER TOWN

Maybe these days could mean so much more 
With eyes wide open and feet on the floor 
This room would not seem so blue 
Painted with blank stares at pictures that have lost their cause 

And the blinds are always closed 
Too block out the cold stares 
The phone is oh so still 
And waiting to break the silence in the air 

And Im huddled over papers 
Creating a world 
To escape the feelings that I once loved 
With words on every building 
These landmarks will reveal 
All of the tiny people 
That have ruined me 
Over the years 

Ive had so many chances to get this right 
But Id just pass by you directing my sight 
At the tiles on the floor at your reflection 
Because its so hard to grow up when youre all alone 

Sitting in my room this loneliness has overtaken me 
All I have is this pen, so I am 

Huddled over papers 
Creating a world 
To escape the feelings that I once loved 
With words on every building 
These landmarks will reveal 
All of the tiny people
