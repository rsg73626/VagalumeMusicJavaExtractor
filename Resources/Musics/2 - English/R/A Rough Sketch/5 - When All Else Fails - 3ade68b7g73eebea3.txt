WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS

Tonight we play to the sound of passing cars 
And this moment is ours 
Under the stars and dreaming again 
The sky is crying tonight 
Washing away all of the pain that spring brings 
And coloring the streets for miles 

Singing melodies to the moon 
And I feel invincible 

When all else fails 
We still have ourselves 
And these nights of rain 
To reflect the sound 
We cant come back down from here 

Just like a fire before a bridge we cannot cross 
Stranded and suspended 
The ropes are almost gone 
Monumental buildings are waiting to be reached 
This rain will surely save us 

Singing melodies the moon 
And I feel invincible 

When all else fails 
We still have ourselves 
And these nights of rain 
To reflect the sound 
We cant come back down from here
