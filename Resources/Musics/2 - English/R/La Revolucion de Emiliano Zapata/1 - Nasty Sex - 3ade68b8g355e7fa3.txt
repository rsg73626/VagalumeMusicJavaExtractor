NASTY SEX

Oh my baby forgot that the rocks can also sing a song of love
oh somebody told me that she was sleeping with a tweaky guy

hey baby change your manners and go by the way of the sun
can't you see that this kind of sex is gonna let you down
let you down

oh my baby forgot that the rock can also sing a song of love
sing a song of love
sing a song of love
