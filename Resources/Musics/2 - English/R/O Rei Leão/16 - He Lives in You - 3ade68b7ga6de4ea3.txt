HE LIVES IN YOU

Night
And the spirit of life
Calling
Wait
There's no mountain too great
Hear the words and have faith
Have faith
He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

He lives in you

He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into te water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you
