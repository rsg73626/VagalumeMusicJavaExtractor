ONE OF US

Deception
Disgrace
Evil as plain as the scar on his face

Deception
(An outrage!)
Disgrace
(For shame!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came

Deception
(An outrage!)
(He can't change his stripes)
Disgrace
(For shame!)
(You know these Outsider types)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)

Deception
(An outrage!)
(Just leave us alone!)
Disgrace
(For shame!)
(Traitor, go back with your own!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)

Born in grief
Raised in hate 
Helpless to defy his fate
Let him run
Let him live
But do not forget what we cannot forgive

And he is not one of us
He has never been one of us
He is not part of us
Not our kind

Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew he would do what he's done
And we know that he'll never be one of us

He is not one of us
