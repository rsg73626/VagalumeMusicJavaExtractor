I'VE GOT A LOVELY BUNCH OF COCONUTS

Down at an english fair one evening I was there 
When I heard a showman shouting underneath the flair 

I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts 
There they are all standing in a row 
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head 
Give them a twist a flick of the wrist 
Thats what the showman said 
IÃ¢ve got a lovely bunch of coconuts 
Every ball you throw will make me rich 
There stands my wife, the idol of me life 
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch 
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch 
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch 
Roll a bowl a ball, roll a bowl a ball 
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch 
Ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts (they're lovely) 
There they are all standing in a row (one, two, three, four) 
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head (and bigger) 
Give them a twist a flick of the wrist 
Thats what the showman said 
Ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts 
Every ball you throw will make me rich 
There stands my wife, the idol of me life 
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch (all together now) 
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch (harmony) 
Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch 
Roll a bowl a ball, roll a bowl a ball 
Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch
