THE MORNING REPORT

[ZAZU]
It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

[MUFASA]
[spoken] Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

[ZAZU]
In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

[MUFASA]
[spoken] Zazu! The morning report!

[ZAZU]
[spoken] Er - yes, Sire - the morning report

Chimps are going ape, firaffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interes in my nest egg but I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited (sung) will be coming back from lunch
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

[MUFASA]
[spoken] What are you doing, son?

[YOUNG SIMBA]
[spoken] Pouncing

[MUFASA]
[spoken] Let an old pro show you how it's done

[ZAZU]
[spoken] The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grass
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is theis season's color
Seen in all the herds
Moving down the rank and file
To near the bottom rung
Far too many beetles are

[sung] Quite frankly in the dung
Aaaaaaaaak!

[MUFASA]

Stay low to the ground
Shh, not a sound
Take it slow
One more step
Then pounce!

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Yeah, stay low!

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

[MUFASA AND ZAZU AND YOUNG SIMBA]
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
