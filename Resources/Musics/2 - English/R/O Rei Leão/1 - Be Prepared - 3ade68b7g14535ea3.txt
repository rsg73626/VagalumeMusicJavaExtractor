BE PREPARED

Scar: 
I know that your powers 
of retention are as wet as a warthog's backside 
But thick as you are, pay attention 
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your 
vacant expressions 
The lights are not all on 
upstairs 
But we're talking 
kings and successions 
Even you can't be caught 
unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime 
Be prepared for sensational news 
A shining new era 
Is tiptoeing nearer 
 
Shenzi: 
And where do we feature? 
 
Scar: 
Just listen to teacher 
I know it sounds sordid 
But you'll be rewarded 
When at last I am given my dues! 
And injustice deliciously squared 
Be prepared!
 
Hyena: 
Be prepared for what? 

Scar: 
For the king's death! 

Hyena: 
Why? Is he sick? 

Scar: 
No, you fool, we're going 
to kill him... and Simba too! 
 
Hyena: 
Great idea! Who needs a king? 
No king, No king, nah nah 
nah nah nah nah! 
 
Scar: 
Idiots! There will Be a king! 
 
Hyena: 
But you just said... 
 
Scar: 
I'm gonna be king 
Stick with me, and you'll 
never be hungry again! 
 
Hyenas: 
Yea!!!!!! Long live the king! 
It's great that we'll soon 
be connected 
With a king who'll be 
all-time adored 
 
Scar: 
Of course, quid pro quo, 
you're expected 
To take certain duties on board 
The future is littered with prizes 
And though I'm the main addressee 
The point that I must emphasize is 
You won't get a sniff without me 
So prepare for the coup of the century 
Be prepared for the 
murkiest scam 
Ooooh! 
Meticulous planning 
We'll have food! 
Tenacity spanning 
Lots of food 
Decades of denial 
We repeat 
Is simply why I'll 
Endless meat 
Be king undisputed 
Aaaaaaaaaah! 
Respected, saluted 
Aaaaaaaaaah! 
And seen for the wonder I am 
Aaaaaaaaaah! 
Yes my teeth and ambitions are bared 
Be prepared! 
 
Hyenas: 
Yes, our teeth and 
ambitions are bared 
Be prepared!
