THE HULA SONG

Loua!

If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat,
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat,
Come on down a dine,
On this tasty swine,
All you have to do is get in line.

Are you aching:
yup yup yup
For some bacon:
yup yup yup
He's a big pig:
yup yup

You can be a big pig too

OY!

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
