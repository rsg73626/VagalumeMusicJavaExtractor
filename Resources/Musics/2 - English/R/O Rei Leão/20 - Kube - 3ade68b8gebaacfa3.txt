KUBE

There's a river
Standing between me
And my home
There's a river
Standing between me
And my home
The name of the river
Kube is the name
The name of the river
Kube is the name

(Chorus)
Kube
Kube-Tu
I've got to cross over
I've got to cross over
Kube-Tu

I've been here
I've been there
All of my life
I've been a rolling stone
A rolling stone
Gathers no moss
All of my life
I've been a rolling stone
Ngi vulel' Indlela Kube [Make way for me, Kube]
Kube Kube Kube-Tu [Kube, please]

(Chorus)
Kube
Kube-Tu
(Repeat)

There's a river
Standing between me
And my home
There's a river
Kube is the name
Got to stand up
Got to move on
Got to build me
A life of my own

Got to stand up
Got to move on
Got to build me
A life of my own
Ngi vulel' Indlela Kube [Make way for me, Kube]
Kube Kube Kube-Tu [Kube, please]

(Chorus)
Kube
Kube-Tu
I've got to cross over
I've got to cross over
Kube-Tu

I've been stumbling and falling
I've got to get up and move on
(Repeat to fade)
