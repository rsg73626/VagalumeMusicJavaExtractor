PUNK PARTY

I want a party without The Stones
I like them a lot but I want The Ramones
I want a party without The Beatles
When I am nostalgic I prefer Sex Pistols
I want a party where I can dance
To The Clash, Undertones and GBH
Discharge in the loo, Exploited in the kitchen
Conflict on the stairs and Vibrators on the sofa
I want a party with the Kennedys
They are the ones who know what hard core is
And afterwards to cool down and send the junkies away
Pogo a lot listening to the Circle Jerks
I want a punk party, I want a punk party
