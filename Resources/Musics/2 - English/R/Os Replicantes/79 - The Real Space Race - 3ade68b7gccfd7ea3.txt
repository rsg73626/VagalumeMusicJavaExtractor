THE REAL SPACE RACE

He spends a year going round the solar system 
He spends a year but comes back to the same place
Where is the world going, to where is it going? 
Where is he going to, to where is he going?
Wherever the world goes to, everybody else goes  
Where is it going in a second?
Will it explode?
Will it get polluted till it can´t breath?
Till it can´t take anymore?
While the third world
Waits for the final judgement
I want a seat on the space race bus
