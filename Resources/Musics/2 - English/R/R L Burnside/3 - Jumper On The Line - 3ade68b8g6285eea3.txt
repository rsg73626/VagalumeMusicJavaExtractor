JUMPER ON THE LINE

See my jumper on, hangin' out on the line
Know by that, something on my mind
I wouldn't be here, baby, if it hadn't been for you
Way down here, way you wanna do
Fix my supper, baby, let me go to bed
Guess white lightnin' done gone to my head
Guess white lightnin' done gone to my head
