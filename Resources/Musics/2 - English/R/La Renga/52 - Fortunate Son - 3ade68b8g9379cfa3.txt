FORTUNATE SON

Some folks are born to wave the flag,
ooh, they're red, white and blue.
and when the band plays "hail to the chief",
ooh, they point the cannon at you, lord,
It ain't me, it ain't me, i ain't no senator's son, son.
it ain't me, it ain't me; i ain't no fortunate one, no,
yeah!
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand,
lord, don't they help themselves, oh.
but when the taxman comes to the door,
lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes,
It ain't me, it ain't me, i ain't no millionaire's son, no.
it ain't me, it ain't me; i ain't no fortunate one, no.
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes,
ooh, they send you down to war, lord,
and when you ask them, "how much should we give?"
ooh, they only answer more! more! more! yoh,
It ain't me, it ain't me, i ain't no military son, son.
it ain't me, it ain't me; i ain't no fortunate one, one.
it ain't me, it ain't me, i ain't no fortunate one, no no no,
it ain't me, it ain't me, i ain't no fortunate son, no no no,
