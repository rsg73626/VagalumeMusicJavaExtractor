BETA LOVE

Golden light, tunnel white
If I run to you, would you stay?
I might be a prototype, but we're both real inside

Would you take me up this time?
Come take me up this time
Cause I'm gonna find that place
No way that I won't
I will find

My beta love
When I find
My beta love
You will be
My beta love
My beta love
Now we're getting closer

Endless hope, I believe
You can't tell me no, it's no dream
In this city of robot hearts, ours we're made to beat

You'll take me up this time
You'll take me up this time
I was made in that place, no way to deny
I will find

My beta love
When I find
My beta love
You will be
My beta love
My beta love
Now we're getting closer

Be my beta love
When I find
My beta love
You will be
My beta love
My beta love
Now we're getting closer
Close to you
