YOU AND I KNOW

Clear my eyes 
From this reverie
So that I don't mind
Ohh, oh no no no
Said I, well I don't
Don't wanna know
Even if you say you know that you
Wanna find my heart
Tell me that you never wanted to

Promise to hide
I'll clear my eyes
I would unburden you from this
Unaware, you, well I need to.

Don't, don't leave a note
Even when you say you know that you
Wanna find my heart
Tell me that you never wanted to
Don't, don't leave a note

Even if you say you know that you
Wanna find my heart
Tell me that you never wanted to

You and I, you and I know
You and I, you and I know
You and I, you and I know
You and I, you and I know
You and I, you and I know
You and I, you and I know
You and I, you and I know

Don't wanna know
Even when you say you know that you
Wanna find my heart, oh
Tell me that you never wanted to
Don't, don't leave a note
Even if you say you know that you
Wanna find my heart, oh
Tell me that you never wanted to
