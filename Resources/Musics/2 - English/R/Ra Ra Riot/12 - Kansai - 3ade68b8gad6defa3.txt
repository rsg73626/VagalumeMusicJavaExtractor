KANSAI

When I came back from San Diego
Checkered lights and rain in the afternoon
Oh, made me miss the imagination I used to have

There's something else
I thought about
The universe
When it's merciful

How should I know
After wringing out my memory
And all that my hands send away
Oh, riffling for a stem to find an answer I knew

There's something else

I thought about
The universe
When it's merciful

Oh, what
What's my blood for?
What shows my dear?
The universe
When it's merciful

Who's light did it come in on?

There's something else
I thought about
The universe
When it's merciful
