OH, LA

Say a word that's quiet, not half the way there
Somedays our future...it seems to hang on so tight
"Come quickly now the air hangs heavily today"
"Oh no, but what is that crimson in the shade?"

Oh la we've got a lot to learn from each other,
We've got to stick together.
Oh la we've got a lot to learn from each other,
We've got to stick together.

I wouldn't say the word now but this is not what I meant,
For a woman that's fallen over head and ears
And still so warm, but I'm lonely too,
Suddenly she is still and says, "I hope that things will be better here."

Oh la we've got a lot to learn from each other,
We've got to stick together.
Oh la we've got a lot to learn from each other,
We've got to stick together.
