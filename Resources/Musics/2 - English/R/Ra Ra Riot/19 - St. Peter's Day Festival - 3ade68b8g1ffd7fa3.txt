ST. PETER'S DAY FESTIVAL

If I go to Gloucester you know I will
wait there for you
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
you know it's worth the nights we wait there
it all falls apart, apart
come on 
come on

If I go to Gloucester you know I will
wait there for you
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
you know it's worth the nights we wait there
it all falls apart, apart

Don't you think by now there's truth
In all she's said to us
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on...and let us in

If the heather is wet then
I might be accustomed to walk
It might bet he way that we talk
The river and the rock that fell there
It all falls apart

When I arrive
Will you wake if I open the door
A tone that was taken before
The cusp and the fjords we wade through
It all falls apart

And it won't take long
Oh, and you're right
Once or twice
Sawney bean

Oh, don't you think by now there's truth
In all she's said to us
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on...and let us in

Arms wide
Arms too wide
But oh there comes a tide

A little more
Finding a way from what's dark
In your eyes
Once or twice
It's a feel

I've a little fawn
And it won't take flight
Oh
For the brightest
Oh christ
It's a farce
