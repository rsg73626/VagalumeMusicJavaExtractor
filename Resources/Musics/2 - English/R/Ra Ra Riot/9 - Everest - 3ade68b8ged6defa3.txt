EVEREST

Haven't heard from you for days
What went wrong?
We waited for you in the dark for much too long
Well, can't you see it in my face?
I like the way it's been
The words I say that you don't hear
Could have been words in your head

Whoa, whoa, I need to let you go
You never do it baby, you know I know
Whoa, whoa, I can't sleep anymore
It's true, I used to dream of black and blue

"Fearless" anger in my mind, It's all that's left of yours
Wondered all the time myself, "What could it be for?"
Well, tell me what you love, you loathe
And you can live without it
Or maybe we could fuck all night and you'll forget about it

This time we know
I will be alone
Ever wonder why
I don't even try?

Whoa, whoa, I need to let you go
You never do it baby, you know I know
Whoa, whoa, I can't sleep anymore
It's true, I used to dream of black and blue

Whoa, whoa, I need to let you go
You never do it baby, you know I know
Whoa, whoa, I can't sleep anymore
It's true, I used to dream of black and blue

This time we know
I will be alone
Ever wonder why
I don't even try?
