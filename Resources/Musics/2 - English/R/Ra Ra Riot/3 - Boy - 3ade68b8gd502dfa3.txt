BOY

When I have once or twice
Thought I lived my life for
Oh, oh, I'll wake up in a thousand years
With every ghost I'm looking through

I was a cold, cold boy
Hey! Oh, when I lie with you
But then I go back through
I

When it's gone and you hope
That your mind's made up
Oh, I'll wake up twenty thousand years
With every ghost of what I knew

I was a cold, cold boy
Hey! Oh, when I lie with you
But when I go back you
I, I

I was a cold, cold boy
Hey! Oh, when I say to you
Then I go back through
I, I
