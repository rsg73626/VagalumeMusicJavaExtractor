WATER

Tired of sleeping on the sidewalk
Working at the bus stop night 'til morning
Tired and waiting for the sunlight
When it comes, it's still dark where I'm going

Don't
Don't punish me for what I feel
Don't
Don't punish me for what I feel

So I crawled out of the back door
Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
So I crawled out of the back door
Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
I jumped into the water
The water

Vicious demons on the Tv
So I sold it on 16th St
But I still hear the drone
Now I'm 'bout to get off this night shift
Do you think I could get a lift?
I don't care where you're going

Don't
Don't punish me for what I feel
Don't
Don't punish me for what I feel

So I crawled out of the back door
Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
So I crawled out of the back door
Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
I jumped into the water
The water

My face was numb, my lungs were sore
But still I swam until my feet could touch the shore
Now I've been sleeping on your porch
I'm still too scared to bust the lock on your door

So I crawled out of the back door
Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
So I crawled out of the back door
Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
I jumped into the water
The water
The water
