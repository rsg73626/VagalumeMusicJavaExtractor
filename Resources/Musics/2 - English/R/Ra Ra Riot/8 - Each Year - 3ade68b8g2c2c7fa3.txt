EACH YEAR

Come on, force it down
I’m imagining
Come on, force it down
I’m imagining

Imaging a place where homes are built on frames
And where they plant new bulbs along our graves
With the fall each year
With the fall each year
Each year


And if you think you might
Yes, but if it’s not so bright
But if you’re a part of my
Whole life

Silhouettes in a window frame
Better run if it's Boo's old man
He won’t know if you’re white,
Oh, in the night

Coverin' a fault with
trials and coy displays
Coverin' a fault with
trials and coy displays

If it isn't worth the time to
Find out how we go
About recalling all the ways
And the reasons are for
With the fall each year
With the fall each year
Each year

And if you think you might
Yes, but if it’s not so bright
But if you’re a part of my
Whole life

Silhouettes in a window frame
Better run if it's Boo's old man
He won’t know if you’re white,
Oh, in the night

Vapor lamps in a parking light
You can’t see when it’s much too far
All that mist in your eyes
Oh, in the night

80 years isn't enough time
50 more isn't more enough
Oh
To right the wrongs
What you're hiding in your back yard
Is turning innocence to apathy
And accusations at another man
Oh
'Cause you don't have a prayer
To put your life into a Christian's hands
Never mind what your
Daughter is taught in school
What she remembers is
What she has learned from you

Silhouettes in a window frame
Better run if it's Boo's old man
He won’t know if you’re white,
Oh, in the night

Vapor lamps in a parking lot
You can’t see when it’s much too far
All that mist in your eyes
Oh, in the night
