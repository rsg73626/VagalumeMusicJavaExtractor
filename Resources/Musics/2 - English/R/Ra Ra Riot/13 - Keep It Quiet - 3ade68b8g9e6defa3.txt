KEEP IT QUIET

Four hours up I-95
You and me were cold
If you want to compromise, I can't hold on
I know it's wrong, it's a cold life though, oh

Cold water for cooling down
But you know that when you stay around
Old fortune for subtle leave
Oh, but maybe you're sincere, sister, oh, another, oh

Trouble having satisfied two different halves
Can I give up on one? It's a thought I hate
All I could lose
It's a cruel life I choose, oh

Cold water for cooling down
But you know that when you stay around
Old fortune for subtle leave
Oh, but maybe you're sincere

Keep it quiet, keep it quiet
Oh, my heartbeat, keep it quiet
Through the doorway, keep it quiet
Yes, I'm tired, keep it quiet

Cold water for cooling down
But you know that when you stay around
Old fortune for subtle leave
Oh, but maybe you're sincere

All my doubt, all my doubt
How can I want to stay around?
All my doubt, all my doubt
How can I want to stay around?

How can I want to stay around?
How can I want to stay around?

All my doubt, all my doubt
How can I want to stay around?
How can I want to stay around?
