TOO TOO TOO FAST

We have forgotten so much since then
The scent of your breath again
Or maybe it's the way we fell
don't fall
Stop looking out to pretend
Everything is still there

We have forgotten so much since then
The scent of your breath again
Or maybe it's the way that we fell
Don't fall
Stop looking up

Pretending this is not
What it might have come from
The tide or your luck

She'd have said it's cruel
I only cared about the
Things that you don't

Anything that's right
We had much more
Anything worth losing
Pleasing you

When I look in your eyes
What am I supposed to do
When I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes

We have forgotten so much since then
The august light on my hands
Is it the tone we defend
Don't fall
Stop looking up

Cause still I had a thought
A day couldn't tell
The weight or a change

The way that we are
I can't tell if I'm
Asleep or awake

Anything that's right
Pleasing you

When I look in your eyes
What am I supposed to do
When I look in your eyes
Alright, alright
When I look in your eyes
Oh what am I
Supposed to do
What did I do

I could tell you were there
Lying awake and aware
I'm feeling I got no
Sense of what's left or gone
What's left or gone
Gimme something to leave with
The feeling that you're not mine
We're feigning words in the place
Of people we used to know

When I look in your eyes
What am I supposed to do
When I look in your eyes
Alright, alright
When I look in your eyes
Oh what am I
Supposed to do
What did I do
