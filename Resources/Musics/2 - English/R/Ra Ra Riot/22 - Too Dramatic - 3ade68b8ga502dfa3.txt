TOO DRAMATIC

On my black feet, I
Run with all my heart
To black shores and rivers
In spite of all I fear

You're too dramatic
I don't understand it

Don't listen when you're weary, oh but
I wanna talk about it
You and me weren't made for that
I'm sure

'Not in my house'
It doesn't stop for you
It doesn't stop for, aah-ah


You're too dramatic
I don't understand it
Out of this static
'Cause you're too dramatic

'You know I couldn't live here that way'
You said it before
He left Cincinnati just sixteen
Had this feel, boy

And though I guess
That there's nothing honest (honest)
All that matters
Is that

You're too dramatic
I don't understand it
Outta this static
'Cause you're too dramatic

But the people I knew
Don't matter to me anymore

'Cause you're too dramatic
I don't understand it
You're too dramatic
I don't understand it
Out of this static
'Cause you're too dramatic	
Aaah-ah-ah
