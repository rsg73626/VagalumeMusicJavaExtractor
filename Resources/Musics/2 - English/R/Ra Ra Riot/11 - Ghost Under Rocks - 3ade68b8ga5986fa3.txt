GHOST UNDER ROCKS

Uh, oh, ohhh (6x)

With every little thing
Your owner's lookin back
At you it starts to mean
Less than it ever did

Oh, ever 
On every inch of stone
Skin and bone
Made to leave you

Here you are 
You are breathing 
Like little ghosts 
Under rocks
That don't sound 
In pockets
Folks found your problem
It's lost and forgotten

Oh, oh, oh
You soak in one dream
Youâ€™ve spent there 
You are gonna dream there

Right 
Now you ask your baby
Why? why? why?

Forget 
The the frequent flyers
Leading an honored life
To give us this much more
Safe from a cut and cheer

On ever 
On every inch of stone
Skin and bone
Made to leave you

Here you are 
You are breathing 
Like little ghosts 
Under rocks
That don't smile in public
Folks found your problem
It's lost and forgotten

Oh, oh, oh
You soak in one dream
You've spent there 
You are gonna dream there

Dryyyy
Now you ask your babies 
Why? why? why? why?

And if you can't decide
You will do 
Either weep or moan
Your wasting 
In a moments to
Anyway you want it to
Ohh 
But you could have had
Turn it into broken wood
Takin' off a Saturday
I'm gonna fan a parasoul
Am fairer than a clown 
Oh, no
Maybe there 
Were two again
And if it ever 
Was at all
I'm taking you up 
As an offer 
Up as an offer

Here you are 
You are breathing 
Like little ghosts 
Under rocks
That don't sound 
In pockets
Folks found your problem
It's lost and forgotten

Oh, oh, oh
You soaking 
In one dream
You've spent there
You have gone 
And dream there

Now you ask your babies 
Why? why? why? whyyy?
