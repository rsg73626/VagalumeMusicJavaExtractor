WINTER '05

Orange lamps shine by willow bay
Ice covers from the lake to where I lay
In a state
In which I dream

If you were here
Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
And if you were here
Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone

But instead I sit atop the crest
Looking down on the valley where the dead rest
And every morning I wake beside myself

But I digress

If you were here
Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
And if you were here
Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone

If you were here
Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
And if you were here
Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone

If you were here
Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
And if you were here
Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone
