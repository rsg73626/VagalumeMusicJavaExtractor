DO YOU REMEMBER

Wondering if all of your light it was
I would be a fool if I let it die
Could I get you alone tonight
Oh

Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain
Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain

Don't let me be afraid of our life apart
Darling say something
Ohh, I never could
Can I get you alone tonight?
Oooohh tonight

Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain

Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain

On my heels
Oh I don't mind

On my heels
Oh I don't mind

When I come over to you
It's such a lonely talk
She said "hey come on now"
Nooo we both got a little time
Tonight
Tonight
Ohhh tonight
Ohhh tonight

Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain

Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain

On my heels oh I don't mind
(Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain)

On my heels oh I don't mind
(Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain)

On my heels oh I don't mind
(Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain)

On my heels oh I don't mind
(Do you remember what you said to me then?
Under the oak trees and the leaves in the rain)
