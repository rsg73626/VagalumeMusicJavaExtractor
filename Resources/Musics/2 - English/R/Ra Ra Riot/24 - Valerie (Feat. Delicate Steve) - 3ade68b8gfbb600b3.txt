VALERIE (FEAT. DELICATE STEVE)

So wild, standing there
With her hands in her hair
I can't help remember
Just where she touched me
There's still no face
Here in our place

So cool, she was like
Jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

Love songs fill the night
But they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry
Just like they're dying

Her cries hang there
In time somewhere
Someday some good
Wind may blow her back to me
Some night I may
Here her like she used to be
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

(Instrumental Interlude)

So cool, she was like
Jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

I'm the same boy I used to be
