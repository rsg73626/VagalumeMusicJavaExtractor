MASSACHUSETTS

In Massachusetts, in Massachusetts
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

The younger of the ocean sing
A paean to their mother, offering
To hold tight onto the quay
To hold tight onto the silent way

Oh, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter
No, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter what you do

In Massachusetts, in Massachusetts
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

A certain lack and dislocation
Sotted up to the gunwales, and
The tide tells you when to go
The tide, it tells you when to come and to go, go

It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter
No, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter what you do

I can't find my roads
I can't, I can't find my roads
Honestly, I want to hear the thought that I had
But I can't feel anymore with you

In Massachusetts, in Massachusetts
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

To be held at bay and then consigned
To pet about the frozen time
To a mother so cold and gray
And though she gives you one, she takes one away

Oh, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter
No, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter what you do

In Massachusetts, in Massachusetts
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

The younger of the ocean sing
A paean to their mother, offering
To hold tight onto the quay
And though she gives you one, she takes one away

Oh, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter
No, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter what you do

I can't find my roads
I can't, I can't find my roads
Honestly, I want to hear the thought that I had
But I can't feel anymore with you

Opens, it dies
How can I only say it's a dark mind?
It's a dark mind
It's a dark mind

Oh, I can tell the things for you
I want someone like you
Watching it roll by
Watching it roll by

In Massachusetts, in Massachusetts
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

To be held at bay and then consigned
To pet about the frozen time
To a mother so cold and gray
And though she gives you one, she takes one away

Oh, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter
No, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter what you do
