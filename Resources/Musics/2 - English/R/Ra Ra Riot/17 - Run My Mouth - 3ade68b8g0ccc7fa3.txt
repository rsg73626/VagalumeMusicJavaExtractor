RUN MY MOUTH

All my days end too slow
And I wonder where I've left to go
Anyway, there's no such thing as company.
I've discovered all I've got to do.

What is it that gets you through
Another day when I'm not there.
Wish we could be more open,
I don't have time to think of how you are.

All my days end too slow,
And I wonder where I've left to go.
Besides I've got no one but myself to blame,
I discovered all I've got to do is

Run my mouth off

When I dream it's not of you,
Something in your voice that I can't hear
But some company it is,
Because I feel so close when I wake,
And in fifty years no one will care
That I was once there...

All my days end too slow,
And I wonder where I've left to go.
Anyway, there's no such thing as company.
I've discovered all I've got to do

Run my mouth off

Never wanted time for looking back,
For a moment I look down and wander
And of what's to come today,
Girl, I wonder where you are.

All my days end too slow,
And I wonder where I've left to go.
Besides I've got no one but myself to blame.
I discovered all I've got to do is

Run my mouth off.
