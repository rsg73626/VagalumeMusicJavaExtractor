THE ORCHARD

We both had doubts
We both had doubts
I found myself while I was away
All your life, now I understand
So many hours
And no company
But you imagine things
Through cold eyes asleep
Then what have I seen this for?
We both know about

All my life
You were important
And your father too
Wandering the orchard
Through budding dormant eyes
On a lamp-lit plain

You imagine things
Why does he speak to me?
To you, I know, I only stare without
My life is dark
And my body aches
Oh then what I have I seen this for?

Oh I imagine things
Through cold eyes asleep
And I won't think back more than I do
My life is dull
And my body aches
All this blood in my mouth
Makes me hate
How we both end up.
