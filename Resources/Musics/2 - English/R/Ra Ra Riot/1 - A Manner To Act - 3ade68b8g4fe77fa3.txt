A MANNER TO ACT

Baby oh touch me like you did in the summer when i woke up just to hear
Speakers made of tin cans piercing through my window like a cold breeze on my ear
Sittin on the stoop in the yard I looked so tired I can tell that its early you know
Oh its much to far to walkin all by myself.

(Chorus)
What a manner to act
like a heart attack
because lookin back
you woulda worked it like this

9 o'clock is late for the sun
but the subways on the 7 block
to way and i'll be there soon
we're walking to the boulevard
it never seemed as bad
as any other time passing through
keep on lookin down at the pavement
with hope that there's no one
can hear your pocket full of keys

Oh them pain feel the skinless callous on my feet

(Chorus)
What a manner to act
like a heart attack
because lookin back
you woulda worked it like this

What a manner to act
like a heart attack
because lookin back
you woulda worked it like this
i got these stiches in my eyes
and there are too many things
that feel like that you are talking about!
