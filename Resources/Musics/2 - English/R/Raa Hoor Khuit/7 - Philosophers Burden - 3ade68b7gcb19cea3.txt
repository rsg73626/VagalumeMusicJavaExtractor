PHILOSOPHERS BURDEN

Motionless between the spheres 
At the horizons of the universe. 
The spectral fields' philosophy 
Archaic holy blasphemy. 

Archaic relict of 
Religious restrain; 
Roaming mind into 
Mental exile. 
Mental exile! 

Returning to point zero it 
Makes you understand the 
Wisdom of the strange land, 
toward the stars of 
Obscurity. 

Archaic relict of 
Religious restrain; 
Roaming mind into 
Mental exile. 
Mental exile! 

No prophets! 
No resurrection! 
An awaking of the mind; 
A blooming of perceptions. 

Awareness of forbidden thoughts, 
growing in the 
philosopherâ€™s fields.
