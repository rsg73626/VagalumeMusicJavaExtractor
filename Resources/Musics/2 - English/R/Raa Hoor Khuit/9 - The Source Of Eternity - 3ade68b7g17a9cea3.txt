THE SOURCE OF ETERNITY

I am here to bring the pleasure
Of flesh - eternal ecstasy.
Prospered by my bloody kiss.
Desires of endless passion and pain.

You taste my kiss of bloody lips
Sweet desires of your flesh
In this moment full of lust.
Now her body looks so pale;
By the moonlight blood is black.
Romanitc scene by love of death.

I am here to bring the pleasure
Of flesh - eternal ecstasy.
Prospered by my bloody kiss.
Desires of endless passion and pain.

Her soul of innocence will learn,
What her cunt can give to her
In this moment of new born life from death.
Now her eyes are without light
And she is seeing her new way
To become an angel of the sin.

For now and ever you will walk
Through darkend lands of lust
And suffering will be your instinct.
Iâ€™ll show you the new path!

Look into my eyes and you will see
The pain of a thousand lifes,
Which have died by the force
Of my black love of soul
To show you the forbidden sides.
Let me see them die
Let me see desire
And forever hear them cry
