AEONS APART

On both sides of the river 
There is life, 
Just for existence of 
Everything which was 
Lost in time, passing by 
From both ends. 

They have seen all the lives 
Passing by, but still they are 
Waiting. 
Waiting for the time 
When coexistence will begin. 

Traveling to its end, 
To become like the river, 
A fluid of all kind of existence, 
Coming from the point, 
Where everything will begin 
And all ends. 

They have seen all the lives 
Passing by, but still they are 
Waiting. 
Waiting for the time 
When coexistence will begin. 

The aeon of Aquarius will begin 
And knowledge will lead the way 
To the edge of past and future. 
Life has gone, 
Life will come, 
On there way 
To wisdome
