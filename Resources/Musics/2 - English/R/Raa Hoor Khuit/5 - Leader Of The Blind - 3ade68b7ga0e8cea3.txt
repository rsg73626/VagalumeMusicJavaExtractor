LEADER OF THE BLIND

Sitting in the position,
Given by the master,
To free the mind.
Breathing to feel the pulse.

Rising with every
Second of your live;
Look at them,
They gonna give you
What you need,
To destroy the weak.

Feel the light in your heart,
That shines out of your mind,
To give you the words,
To understand what you really are.

Rising with every
Second of your live;
Look at them,
They gonna give you
What you need,
To destroy the weak.

The will is the law,
So understand it means,
To hold the universe in your hands.

When your body leaves you,
The mind will lead
Your world.
The physical shape
Is just an image,
To show mankind
What more there is.

Rising with every
Second of your live;
Look at them,
They gonna give you
What you need,
To destroy the weak.
