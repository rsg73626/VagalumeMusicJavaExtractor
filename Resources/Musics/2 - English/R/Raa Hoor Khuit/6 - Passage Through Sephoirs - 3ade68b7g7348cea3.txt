PASSAGE THROUGH SEPHOIRS

Awake! 

See what I have seen! 

Hear my words of 
Inner strength, 
See my shadow reaping, 
All of the ghosts, 
Of times that have gone. 
I will lead them to the place, 
Where the future is past. 
Die by my words. 

I see all of you. 
All your forgotten sides. 
My mind forces your body 
To follow my will. 

Feel the cold heat of my name, 
It will lead you through the sephiors. 

Souls are raped 
By angels cunts, 
When they behold them with 
Their black eyes. 
I am the angels, that 
Creeps like dreams to them. 
Crawl beneath the source 
Of every blind soul, to lead. 

I see all of you. 
All your forgotten sides. 
My mind forces your body 
To follow my will. 

0 = 2! I am the 10, JOD to make you understand. 
From Malkuth to Kether! 

Cry for me. 
See what I was. 
Feel, feel the sun in my heart. 
The sun which leads to the might.
