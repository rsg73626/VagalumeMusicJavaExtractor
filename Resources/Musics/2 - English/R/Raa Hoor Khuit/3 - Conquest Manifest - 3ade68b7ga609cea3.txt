CONQUEST MANIFEST

Obey us, 
The masters of devastation. 
See the path, 
We will rule the new world. 
The kings of all 
That has been created. 
The kings of all 
That has died. 

We are the path! 
We are the force! 
Open your heart to endless night! 
We are the path! 
We are the force! 
Possesing your heart with fathomless might! 

We posses your mind. 
We infest your body. 
We dominate. 
We terrorise. 
We battle paradise. 

Our legions will 
Leave scorched soil. 
Your world is 
In our hands. 
In the hands of 
Your majesty. 
Earth and sky; 
Heaven and hell. 

We are the path! 
We are the force! 
Open your heart to endless night! 
We are the path! 
We are the force! 
Possesing your heart with fathomless might!
