BIRTH OF IMMORTAL STARS

By the name
Of the new aeon,
We will praise
The beeings
That we are,
And crossing all
The pathes which
Are meant,
To see the secret
Deep inside the mind.
Traveling within the
Ghost of immortality.

Whatching the pulsing light
Of a new born star.
He will shine through your mind,
Inflaming what could never burn.

Watching the pulsing light
Of a new born star.
He will shine through your mind,
Inflaming what could never burn.

To the place where
The weak will never be,
Or see
Their own death.
Spreading his mighty arms,
Teaching what is the
Inner strength of my soul.
Shown by the number
Of the name,
He will recognize
The power behind
The facade.

Watching the pulsing light
Of a new born star.
He will shine through your mind,
Inflaming what could never burn.
