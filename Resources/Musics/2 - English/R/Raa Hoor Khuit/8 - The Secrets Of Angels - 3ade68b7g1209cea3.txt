THE SECRETS OF ANGELS

I am the first, 
I am the last, 
Death means nothing to me; 
It only leads to all 
The secrets of immortality. 
Beauty is hidden beneath 
The ugliness of all the 
Knowledge, which was told to 
Me. 

See, what can’t be seen! 
Hear, what can’t be heard! 
Feel, what can’t be felt! 
Speak, what is to say! 

See the secrets 
Of dead angels; 
They will reveal 
Within your mind. 
Exhale your divine vibrations, 
To gather mystic stimulations. 

Worship your 
Holy strength. 
Blessed is every part 
Of inner wisdom 
Rising upon your 
Self created futur. 
I am what 
I have to be, 
So are you. 

See, what can’t be seen! 
Hear, what can’t be heard! 
Feel, what can’t be felt! 
Speak, what is to say!
