IMMORTAL TWILIGHT MAJESTY

Her colours shine to me 
Like the light of the stars. 
With her impious strength 
She gave me all I ever 
Needed for my arcane 
ritual magick. 

The angels 
Gave me the might; 
Twilight of the gods; 
To blind the ignorant 
By the domination of 
It’s name. 

Your kingdom is made of 
Flesh, so we will leave behind 
All the borders of the 
Microcosmic world 
And you’ll show me the way 
Out of this agony 
I had before you came. 

The angles 
gave me the might; 
Twilight of the gods; 
To rise like those, 
Who have been here, 
Before the sun was born. 

Desire of passion, 
Desire of pain, 
Makes me stay with you, 
Leads me to the point 
Where I find fame. 
In your arms I die. 

The angles 
gave me the might; 
Twilight of the gods; 
To rise like those, 
Who have been here, 
Before the sun was born. 
This is my fate; 
This is my existence, 
Since I was unborn 
For this endless life.
