THIS IS WHAT I SAY

R Code
R Code
The Code is it... 

How you get it what’s up nigga
The peoples of the crib oh man, I’m stunt
The rap is back nigga doin’ various tracks
The R code in attack
He’s doin’ you type are doin’ in a click
C’mon baby don’t be sick
Clothes off, are heat
Oh baby forget your problems
What I say is truth, the sky is blue this is cool
C’mon baby don’t be fool, this is lesson of school
My name, my type, my style, my mind, my ideas are so so so R
They question me what is it, R Code is what? The girls says it’s so so so hot
I’m speakin’ of more, hey how many o’clock
Yeah is because I say it, this it what I say, hit! 

[CHORUS]

R Code

R Code
Let me take a beer
