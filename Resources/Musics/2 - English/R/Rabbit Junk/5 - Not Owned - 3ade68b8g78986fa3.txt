NOT OWNED

there ain't nothing on this mother
they think we don't own it
they try so hard to make us forget, get
they think we don't own it
they try so hard to make us forget, get
so sick of it
mother f**ker
i saw a sign outside no god damn free ride
what if I took you down tonight
would you put up a fight
it's time we let you go
all the numbers have to show
that we stayin' in control
don't you f**k up the show
they think we don't own it
they try so hard to make us forget,
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, go
they think
I looked down in my hand
and I saw a key
buried under apathy
they gonna try and bury me
I stood with no voice
being confused about my choice
then I thought I'd had enough
it's time to f**k em up
they think we don't own it
they try so hard to make us forget,
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, go
they think
mother f**ker
ther-ther-ther-there ain't ain't noth,
ther-ther-ther-there, mother f**ker
ther-ther-ther-there ain't nothing on
ther-ther-ther-there, mother f**ker
they think we don't own it
they try so hard to make us forget,
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, go
they think
