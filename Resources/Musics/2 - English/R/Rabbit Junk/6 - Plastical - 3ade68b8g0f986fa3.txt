PLASTICAL

such pretty packaging
we're all in the front row salivating
to watch the legless f**king
palms sweaty on the floor
push
push
i can't see myself
there's no reflection
don't know my name
who is this person
depart take a little bit of this
don't feel selfish
ya know you want it take it all
you can't resist
we're part of the illusion now
we're just part of the illusion now
no tear will drop at the empire's fall
it's a dead man's party after all
reality is just a broken law
this is the world of shock and awe
no tear will drop at the empire's fall
it's a dead man's party after all
reality is just a broken law
this is the world of shock and awe
this is, this is
the world of shock and
this is, this is
the world of shock and awe
this is not my face
this isn't real
I'm just dreaming
this can't be the way i feel
depart take a little bit of this
don't feel selfish
ya know you want it take it all
we can't resist
we're part of the illusion now
we're just part of the illusion now
no tear will drop at the empire's fall
it's a dead man's party after all
reality is just a broken law
this is the world of shock and awe
no tear will drop at the empire's fall
it's a dead man's party after all
reality is just a broken law
this is the world of shock and awe
this is, this is
the world of shock and
this is, this is
the world of shock and awe
shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and
shock and awe
this is not real
this is not real
i just can't wake up
i just gotta wake up
no tear will drop at the empire's fall
it's a dead man's party after all
reality is just a broken law
this is the world of shock and awe
no tear will drop at the empire's fall
it's a dead man's party after all
reality is just a broken law
this is the world of shock and awe
this is, this is
the world of shock and
this is, this is
the world of shock and awe
this is the world of shock
and this is the world of shock and awe
shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and, shock and,
shock and awe
about to drop the bomb, about to drop the bomb
about to drop the bomb, about to drop the bomb
