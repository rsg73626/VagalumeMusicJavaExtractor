FEAST

Starting at the dawn of time
Few had feated but most pined
Till it was thought we all should feast
Now we're lost, caught stuck in between

Those who can't, don't know why
Those who can't, could never try
Given the illusion that they can
Little has changed since the dawn of man

Starting at the dawn of time
Few had feated but most pined
Till it was thought we all should feast
Now we're lost, caught stuck in between

Examination of the degradation
Of speculation magnification of
Exasperation due to infiltration
Specialization on most any Tv station
To ensure the continuation of the feast

The feast! The feast!
The feast! The feast!
