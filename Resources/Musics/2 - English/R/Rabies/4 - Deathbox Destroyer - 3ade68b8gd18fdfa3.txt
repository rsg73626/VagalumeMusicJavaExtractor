DEATHBOX DESTROYER

I live for the hunt because I am a beast
If the pools far away I'll come for the feast
I'll find it, I'll drain it, I'll clean it, I'll skate it
I'll find it, I'll drain it, I'll clean it, I'll skate it

I will rip any pool apart

I'll get inside, no fence to high
The tile and coping will be mine
I will leave no block untouched
Wreck the deathbox with my trucks

I will rip any pool apart
I will destroy the deathbox

I'll never stop hunting, I'll never stop finding
I'll never stop destroying, I'll never stop grinding

I'll never stop hunting, I'll never stop finding
I'll never stop destroying, I'll never stop grinding
