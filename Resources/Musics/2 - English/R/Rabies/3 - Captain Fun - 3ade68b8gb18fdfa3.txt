CAPTAIN FUN

It's hard to know what goes around you
When you don't know who you are
Unquestioned truth or unanswered questions

It's hard to know where you're going
When you don't know where you are
I've been having some hard travelin'

A man who knows not where he's been
Is a man who can't see very far
Blind leading the blind

Time will pass,
Will you be there
A lost man, a lost life
Something's in the air
Something's gonna change
