ZOMBIES ATE MY NEIGHBORS

Have you ever been surrounded
By an army of rabid zombies
Has your whole world collapsed
Zombies ate my neighbors
Can they see you, can they smell you
Can they feel you, can they touch you
Can they get you, will they get you
Will they eat your brain?

Can they see you, can they smell you
Can they feel you, can they touch you
Can they get you, will they get you
Will they eat your brain?

You've been noticed, they can smell you
They can feel your warm blood
It's too late, no escape
They can feel your warm blood
Eat you from the inside
From the inside
Eat you from the inside
Eat you from the inside

You've been noticed, they can smell you
They can feel your warm blood
It's too late, no escape
They can feel your warm blood
Eat you from the inside
From the inside
Eat you from the inside
Eat you from the inside
