THE MAN WITH THE FLUTE

No one goes inside my head, my head
Inside my head, it's all red
It comes to me, it chose me, I lose control
Too afraid to even know

Drilling in my head
Drilling in my head
The man with the flute is drilling
In my head

No one goes inside my head, my head
Inside my head, it's all red
It comes to me, it chose me, I lose control
Too afraid to even know

Drilling in my head
Drilling in my head
The man with the flute is drilling
And he never stops

Drilling in my head
Drilling in my head
The man with the flute is drilling
In my head

No one goes inside my head, my head
Inside my head, it's all red
It comes to me, it chose me, I lose control
Too afraid to even know

Drilling in my head
Drilling in my head
The man with the flute is drilling
And he never stops
Never stops
Never stops
Never stops
Never stops
