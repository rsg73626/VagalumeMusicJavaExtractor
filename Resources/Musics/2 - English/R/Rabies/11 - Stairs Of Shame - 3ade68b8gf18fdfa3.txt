STAIRS OF SHAME

Stairs of shame

There's a distinct line I see
One side for you, the other for me
I'll be here long after you're gone
I'm the king, you're my pawn

Stairs of shame
(you'll be sitting on the)
Stairs of shame
(I sentence you)
Stairs of shame
(forever)
Stairs of shame
(forever)

Up in the hill & over the tracks
There's a train that's comin', it's drillin' in my head
The man with the flute & Mr. D
Gonna show you you belong to me

Stairs of shame
(you'll be sitting on the)
Stairs of shame
(I sentence you)
Stairs of shame
