MR. RAGSDALE

Lost his mind in a far away land,
In a war called Vietnam
Now he substitute teaches high-school
Don't be mistaken, He's not in control

Lsd in his coffee drink
Gives him shellshock, makes him freak
Sit down son! Sit down son!

When he's in your class room anything goes
How he got the job nobody knows
Sit down son! Sit down son!
Sit down son! Sit down son!
Sit down son! Sit down son!
Sit Down!

Lsd in his coffee drink
Gives him shellshock, makes him freak
When he's in your class room anything goes
How he got the job nobody knows

Lost his mind in a far away land,
In a war called Vietnam
Sit down son! Sit down son!

Now he substitute teaches high-school
Don't be mistaken, He's not in control
Sit down son! Sit down son!
Sit down son! Sit down son!
Sit down son! Sit down son!
Sit Down!

Lost his mind in a far away land,
In a war called Vietnam
Now he substitute teaches high-school
Don't be mistaken, He's not in control

Lsd in his coffee drink
Gives him shellshock, makes him freak
When he's in your class room anything goes
How he got the job nobody knows

Ragsdale!
They call him
Ragsdale!

Ragsdale!
They call him
Ragsdale!
