WHY

When I was a little biddy boy
My grandma bought me a cute little toy
Two Silver bells on a string
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling

When I was little boy In Grammar school
Always went by the very best rule
But everytime the bell would ring
You'd catch me playing with my ding-a-ling

Once while climbing the garden wall,
Slipped and fell had a very bad fall
I fell so hard I heard birds sing,
But I held on to My ding-a-ling

Now this here song it ain't so bad
Prettiest little song that you ever had
And those of you who will not sing
Must be playing with your own Ding-a-ling


Why, why, why
Cause, I don't give a fuck
Why, why, I don't give a fuck
Why, why, I don't give a fuck
Why, why, cause I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
