THE TEETH

The teeth dig in
There is no way that you'll win
Rip & shred through layers of skin
Pierce & hold you till the end
To the bone the bite penetrates
As your life disintegrates

They know what you know
They feel what you feel
The teeth rip so deep
But is it real?

The sharp, digging, piercing, ripping teeth
The evil grinning, shredding, tearing teeth
Into nothing & you're done & you're gone

The sharp, digging, ripping piercing teeth
Gouging, maiming, tearing, shredding teeth
My teeth, your teeth, the teeth
