GAME OVER

The inscription on the tomb
In your halls & on your walls
Nobody understood
So the fools made the calls

To the people, to the public
To the masses in the places
I can tell nothing has changed
From the look on your faces

Confusion from a sign, burned into you mind
Confusion from a sign, burned into you mind

Everywhere you go, disease
Everything you know, disease
Everything you'll be, disease
All I wanna see, disease
Everywhere you go, disease
Everything you know, disease
Everything you'll be, disease
All I wanna see, disease

In the spinning typhoon you'll hear a sonic boom
You try to make your move but there's no room
You waste your time, thinking that you can
& the walls cave in from a shady plan
& you're dead

Game Over
