PROGRESS IN DISGUISE

Halfway in & halfway out
Not back then & not right now
A man who was certain who's now in doubt
A fish under water with a hook in it's mouth

He who talks, cannot walk
He who walks, has been taught
He who thinks cannot believe
And the rest won't be ready

The fool becomes the wise
Progress in disguise
On a day neither foul nor fair
It isn't here nor there

Halfway in & halfway out
Not back then & not right now
A man who was certain who's now in doubt
A fish under water with a hook in it's mouth

He who talks, cannot walk
He who walks, has been taught
He who thinks cannot believe
And the rest won't be ready

The fool becomes the wise
Progress in disguise
On a day neither foul nor fair
It isn't here nor there

Halfway in & halfway out
Not back then & not right now
A man who was certain who's now in doubt
A fish under water with a hook in it's mouth

He who talks, cannot walk
He who walks, has been taught
He who thinks cannot believe
And the rest won't be ready

A man who was certain who's now in doubt
A fish under water with a hook in it's mouth
A man who was certain who's now in doubt
A fish under water with a hook in it's mouth
