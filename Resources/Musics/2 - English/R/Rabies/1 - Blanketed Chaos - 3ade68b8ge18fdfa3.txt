BLANKETED CHAOS

Cosmic dust blankets your mind
As galaxies explode dissolving time
Sucked down a black hole, sucked down a tube
Destruction is massive, fate is doom

A ripple grows, time slows down
The missing link is finally found
Makes no difference, it's already done
Scorched & burned by the sun

Smoldering ruins larger than
No hope, a one sided fight
Planets explode into balls of fire
Suns power finally expired

Cosmic dust blankets your mind
As galaxies explode dissolving time
Sucked down a black hole, sucked down a tube
Destruction is massive, fate is doom

A ripple grows, time slows down
The missing link is finally found
Makes no difference, it's already done
Scorched & burned by the sun
