BURNING TIRES

Mile after mile it goes on & on
The tires are spinning, but my mind is gone
Am I driving, Am I sleeping
It's just a blur & now I'm caving

The difference between awake & sleep
Is a difference I can't keep
It's hard to think, It's hard to believe
I'm trying to drive & I'm trying to sleep

I can smell 'em!
The burning tires!
I can smell 'em!
The burning tires!
