LOVE IS STRANGER THAN FICTION

There are walls
before me
There are walls
all around me
And walls that keep me safe

There are secrets, and strategies
hide-outs and ciphers
snakes and snipers
and tales that make me brave


There are secret doorways
with secret codes
no one seems to know
I've got borders and spies
I've got x-ray eyes
and signs that lie
and tests that everyone
must satisfy


I want to feel the love
I want to take a chance
walk tall in the sun
and live a life of romance
But I can't be sure
If sex is an addiction
And faith is an affliction
and love is stranger than...
love is stranger than...
Love is stranger than fiction



There are parapets and batteries,
bridges and motes,
mythology, biology and
scanners and ghosts
there's poison and prophesy
and riddles that everyone
must answer by rote


I want to feel the love,
sing songs in the rain
I want to look in your eyes
and know you feel the same
But I can't be sure'
If hope is just illusion
and ego is delusion,
this life is strange confusion
'cause love is stranger than fiction



I'd learn Morse code
I'd send smoke to the sky
I'd take your word as gospel
And never ask why
I'd hang my hair from the window
leave crumbs in the dust
I'd taste a poison apple
if I knew I could trust
that you'd touch my heart
and set me free

kiss my eyes,
lift this blindness from me
can you... save me'?
Can you save'me...?


I've got protocols and firewalls,
scripture and verse
I'm sheltered from sin
but it only gets worse
Protected from the world
so nothing gets in
no sign of life,
no hope from within


I want to feel the love
but I can't take the pain
I want to hide from the son
and not have to explain
'cause I'll never be sure
that sex is an addiction
and faith is an affliction
'cause love is stranger than...
love is stranger than...
Love is stranger than fiction

love is stranger than-
love is stranger than-
Love is stranger than fiction
