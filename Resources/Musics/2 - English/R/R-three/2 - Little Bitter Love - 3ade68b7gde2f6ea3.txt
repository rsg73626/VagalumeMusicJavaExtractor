LITTLE BITTER LOVE

I see suffering and pain
times, they look the same:
victims bear the blame and I can't save
anybody

Little bitter love
little bitter love

I can't save anybody
I can't be happy
when I see someone's dream come true
I can't be happy
when I see someone loving you

Little bitter love
little bitter love

I can't be happy...
I can't save anybody...

Little bitter love
little bitter love
