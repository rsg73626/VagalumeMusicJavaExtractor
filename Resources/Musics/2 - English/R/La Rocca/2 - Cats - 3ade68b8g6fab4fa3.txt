CATS

Did I say a little too much
Did I make a little bit up
I did
I did

Did you turn away in doubt
eat the food that they left out
I did
I did

Only for our faces (x4)

We go beyond that, so far we' cats
We go beyond that, so far we' cats

Going round all judgement bars
making love in cars
Oh yes sir
no m'an

Taking odds I've never heard
breaking almost every word
yes sir
no m'an

Only for our faces (x4)

We go beyond that, so far we' cats
We go beyond that, so far we' cats

Only for our faces (x4)

We go beyond that, so far we' cats
We go beyond that, so far we' cats

We go beyond that, so far we' cats
We go beyond that, so far we' cats

Did you march against the war
nail a cross upon your door
Oh I did
