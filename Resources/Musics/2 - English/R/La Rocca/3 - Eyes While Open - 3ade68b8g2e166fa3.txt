EYES WHILE OPEN

You keep one talking bout these winter blues 
All across the lowlands 
People getting used to the walking in the daytime 
While the little men go choose 
Arrested fathers with their Monday heads 
Get suspicious of the women who know more in bed 
And the whole thing shows what the space race failed to prove 

After the light show and the ball of flames 
All the elephants go back to their poker games 
And the money takes a one-way trip on a southbound train 
Amazing brandy and the Ace of Spades 
Talk to Dylan with the only who didn't get laid 
And everyone agreed on the meaning behind the news 
We're being used 

I've never been here but the brochures' nice 
Says the staff here is friendly but the management lies 
And the ceiling comes free if we just get online and dice 
Too many owners and not enough teams 
Too many ideas and not enough wet wet wet dreams 
So pu that wallet away cause i can't pay what's due 
And nor can you 
We're being used 

I'd bow my head if the king walked by 
But he'd better stay focued on the glint oin my eye 
For his right hand man may taste a bullet and die 
If immagration stops us getting through 
Thenj we'll hit 'em with the joke bout the 2ft shoe 
And if that doesn't work then we'll just hi 'em with the truth 
Were bieng used 

Heaven's got a porblem with the casting couch 
Cause if God does the interview, You'd better watch out 

It's a rumour right now 
But Jesus won't you tell us the truth 
We're being used
