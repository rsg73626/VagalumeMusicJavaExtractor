GOODNIGHT

It's too late, the sky's performing 
we must have missed our warning sign that day 
there's so much that we've no longer got 
as my eyes fall down across your face 

I remember songs that brought us in the corner of your room 
you held too close for both of us, till nothing touched could move 

I know, it doesn't silence anyone 
so what could anyone say 
there's been but two meanings in our lives 
what you want and what I can't hide 

The fallen cry, the empty driveway lights don't take me home 
you held too close for both of us 
'till nothing said was known 
because I know a place I'm going to, like nowhere that you've been 
goodnight, goodnight 

The fallen cry, the empty driveway lights don't take me home 
you held too close for both of us 'till nothing said was known 
I remeber songs that brought us in the corner of your room 
you held too close for both of us 'till nothing said was known 

The time is over goodnight 
leaving us the way I thought it might 
cause I know a place I'm going to like nowhere that you've been 
goodnight, goodnight 

Naah*
