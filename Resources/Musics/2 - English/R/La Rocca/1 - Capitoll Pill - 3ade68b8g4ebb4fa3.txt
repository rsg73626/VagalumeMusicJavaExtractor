CAPITOLL PILL

Does it matter that my eyes do go
speech may slow, speech may slow

Does it matter that my late night call
came at all, came at all

Does it matter that I don't impress
distinguished guests, distinguished guests

I know I'm impossible cause I convine myself
of thing that are impossible
with someone else
and you can be my silent type
Baby, those pauses can make my night
please keep your sweet lips closed tight

Does it matter how I sign my name
It don't mean fame, it don't mean fame

Does it matter that a girl might smile
it's worth a try, it's worth a try

I know I'm impossible cause I convince myself
of things that are impossible
with someone else
and you can be my silent type
Baby, those pauses can make my night
please keep your sweet lips closed tight

You can be my silent type
baby, those pauses can make my night
You can be my silent type
baby, those pauses can make my night

Sign my name, sign my name
Sign my name, sign my name
I don't impress, I don't impress
I don't impress, I don't impress
