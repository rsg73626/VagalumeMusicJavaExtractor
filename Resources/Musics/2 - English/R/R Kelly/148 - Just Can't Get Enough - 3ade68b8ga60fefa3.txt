JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH

Oh Baby I know you gotta go
But you know I want to keep your love
Right beside me, all night and
When the morning comes I'm ready to go
Again through the night baby

I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
So good, baby

The way you give it to me
Baby, I keep running back
For seconds, Oh baby
And the more you give to me my baby Is the more
I gotta have it

I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough, So good

And I call you my Ms. Fix-It-Lady
The way you fix me baby
You are my Ms. Fix-It-Lady
And when I'm fiendin for your love
You are right there

To give me my fix Ms. Fix-It-Lady
And ever since the first hit of your love
I've been hooked

And I, I keep coming back and I, I keep coming back
I keep, I keep coming back coming back I keep coming back
For more

I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough of you you you you you you baby
I just can't get enough
