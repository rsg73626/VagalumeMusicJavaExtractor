GET OUT OF HERE WITH ME

Are you by yourself
Is there someone else
Baby
I've got a suggestion
Why don't you just
Get out of here with me baby
Cause it's too many people in here
And my house just happens to be near
Not very far away
Right around the corner
Oh baby
Let's get somewhere
Where you can slip out of something and slip in to something
Get out of here with me baby
Cause it's just too many people in here yeah
Far too many people
And I just want a little privacy
Oh
Me and you
There's things I want to do to you I cannot do
Get out of here
Oh my god
Lady, we can take this last drink
And then you'll take a ride with me
And I promise we won't be long
It won't be long
Before we get to my home
Go somewhere else so that I can get you to myself
Get out of here with me
Baby baby, Girl
I want to lay you down, down, down
I want to lay you down
So tell me down babe
Just say it
What do I have to do?
Do I have to go down on my knees
My baby
Begging you, begging you, baby please baby baby please
Get out of here with me
Please baby
Say nothing to no-one and just walk out of here with me
Girl come on cause I promise
Baby you won't be [?]
Girl I just want to take, I just want to take
You, I really want to take you
Out of here with me
Get you and lay you down, and make you scream
Hear me talking
In a room full of just us
Exactly what I prayed for
Heaven answer my prayer
Thank you God
Now that I'm here with you
Get ready baby
Cause I'm so ready baby
So ready to explode
In you
I'm so glad that you took my hand when I said
Get out of here with me Baby
Thank you baby
For leaving with me
