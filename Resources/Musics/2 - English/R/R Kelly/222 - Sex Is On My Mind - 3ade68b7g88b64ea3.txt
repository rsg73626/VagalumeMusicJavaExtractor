(chorus) 
Sex is on my mind. 
(I wanna love you down if you let me) 
Sex is on my mind. 
(I wanna be the one that you sexin') 
Sex is on my mind. 
(I wanna love you down if you let me) 
Sex is on my mind 
(I wanna be the one that you sexin') 

(verse 1) 
I know she heard it on the phone,
but she was to fly for me,you know
I knew that this time I would have to come real 
so she could know exactly how I feel, eel. 

And I wanted her to be with me,
kissing her lips is all my mind would think
Just when I dont know and I can not wait
to lick that booty(booty). yeah. 


(chorus) 


(verse 2) 
I finally got her all alone
I spit so hard I saw it right through her clothes
Then I licked my lips cause I knew today,
that I would finally get my way, yeahh.
And this is like a freaky dream, 
I livin' out all of, all these fantasies
She was a freak that would do many things,
just to hear me scream 


(bridge 2x's) 
Girl you know you got me goin' crazy. 
(got me goin crazy baby) 
Cause in my mind itz sayin'ba-by. 
Cause you know you got me goin' crazy...all the time.

(chorus)
