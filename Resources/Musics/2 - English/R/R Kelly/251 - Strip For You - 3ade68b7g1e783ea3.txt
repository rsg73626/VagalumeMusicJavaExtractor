STRIP FOR YOU

Hey baby...
What you doinâ€™?
Well, stay there.
I got a surprise for you.
Iâ€™m on my way over.

Suddenly I feel like I wanna break loose
Jump in my six and come and see you
Girl, Iâ€™m gonna do something thatâ€™s brand new
Umm, I got a kinky surprise for you
So girl get ready cuz Iâ€™m on my way
Put your sexy body in some negligee
And if you feel me, let me know it right now
Baby, this is how itâ€™s all going down

Thereâ€™ll be
Three knocks at the door, my baby
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby
Sit back in the chair, my baby
Cuz Iâ€™m about to go there, my baby
And get your body real open, baby
Do what you been hopinâ€™, baby
Tonight Iâ€™m gonna pull a switcheroo
Do you mind if I strip for you?

Now Iâ€™ma stop and get some gas, my babe
That gives you time to freshen up, my babe
And if you want, just leave the door unlocked
Iâ€™ll be creepinâ€™ in â€˜bout 12 oâ€™clock
So turn the telephones off, my baby
No interruptions while Iâ€™m driving you crazy
Girl, I want you to know tonight is yours
Start in the bed and end up on the floor

Thereâ€™ll be
Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)
Trench coat hits the floor, my baby
(Sit back) Sit back in the chair, my baby
(Oh) Cuz Iâ€™m about to go there, my baby
(And get your body) And get your body real open, baby
(Do what) Do what you been hopinâ€™, baby
(Tonight) Tonight Iâ€™m gonna pull a switcheroo
(Do you) Do you mind if I strip for you?

BRIDGE: 
Baby, watch as
Slowly rolling
For you (for you)
Whatever you want me to do
I will do
Girl, I promise
Will not regret
(You wonâ€™t regret it)
Iâ€™m everything that you ever wanted
Iâ€™ma strip to the bone
And just let you get on it, girl

Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby
(Just sit back) Sit back in the chair, my baby
(Relax) Cuz Iâ€™m about to go there, my baby
(About to go there) And get your body real open, baby
(Open) Do what you been hopinâ€™, baby
(Tonight) Tonight Iâ€™m gonna pull a switcheroo
(Oh hoo) Do you mind if I strip for you?

(You)
Three knocks at the door, my baby
(I bet three knocks, I bet three knocks)
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby
(Baby just sit back)
Sit back in the chair, my baby
(Iâ€™m about)
Cuz Iâ€™m about to go there, my baby
(Get you open, girl)
And get your body real open, baby
(What you been hopinâ€™, girl)
Do what you been hopinâ€™, baby
Tonight Iâ€™m gonna pull a switcheroo
(Pull a switcheroo)
(Do you mind)
Do you mind if I strip for you?
(If I strip for you)
