GENIUS

[Verse 1]
Your body's so freakin' soft
I can't wait to tear it off
You got me like, lalalalala babe
it's how you make me feel babe
I can feel your butterflies
While I'm kissin' on your thighs
You got me like lalalalala baby
Anticipation's so crazy
I'll be good to you promise
While makin' love to you promise
Go to sleep and when we wake up
I'ma hit that thing again promise
Signs and miracles up in this room
While I'm pleasin' you

[Hook]
I'm blessed with the insight to please your body
Girl tonight you're lying with a sex genius
Nothing like the ordinary I'm a love wonder
Tonight you're lying with a sex genius

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, we're both so freakin' hot
We don't wanna freakin' stop
Got each other like lalalalala babe
Woah tell me I'm the master baby
Now I got you out your clothes
Your body's so beautiful
The mirror says lalalalala babe
This moment's like heaven baby
And I'll be good to you promise
While makin' love to you promise
Go to sleep and when we wake up

Signs and miracles up in this room
While I'm pleasing you
