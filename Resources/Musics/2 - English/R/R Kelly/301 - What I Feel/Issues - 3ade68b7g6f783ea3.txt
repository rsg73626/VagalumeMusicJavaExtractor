WHAT I FEEL/ISSUES

I'm sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got something to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is trying to figure me out
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down cuz I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
If yo had  your way it'd be lock and key
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind

Forgive me father for I have sinned
When was your last confession

His true fears he left without a care
And that was more than I could bare
When you need my help I never tell you no
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Kick off these shoes cuz I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play
So feel me and all that you hear me say
What I'm building up you can't tear it down
Cuz it's built on solid Rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
And if you feel me raise your hand and show

This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
Southside tell me can you feel me
Feel me, feel me
