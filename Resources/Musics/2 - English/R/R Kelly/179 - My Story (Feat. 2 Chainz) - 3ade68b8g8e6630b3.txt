MY STORY (FEAT. 2 CHAINZ)

[Hook]
This is my story
Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story
Money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Came from humble beginnings
Now I'm cocky with my spending
They say "life is just a game"
And I thank God that I'm winning
Models roll my indo'
I beat the pussy, Django
Them niggas talking money
I got more digits in my GEICO
She make a pole disappear like hokus pokus
You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focus
I got every block, every street corners sold up
Whatever club represent my city, throwed up
I own the game, coach slash player shown up
Okay, haters throw fitted never showed up

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Velcro, I'm sticking to it
Hating, I've been a victim to it
Your conversation is
Ain't no hesitation when I finna do it
I stick it in, switch it up and try to hit a friend
Roll, like cinnamon
Woah, big face Benjamin's as she
if you ride with them you ain't going that far
But if you ride with me, 
crib so big we can play hide-and-seek
You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat
Pilot seat, I need a co-pilot
Kiss a ass
Them talking both lips, what you know 'bout boat trips?
Drop her ass at the chocolate factory
Yeah, we did them 12 play's
And you know who you is girl
We been fucking since the 12th grade, goddamn

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Pull up to the club at about 3
I'm killing it, guilty no plea
I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece
we on round three
I speak... they say I'm crazy like they didn't know
See I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar
Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes
Showed her the Jesus piece now she got the holy ghost
They asked them in a interview, 
"why do he love these girls? "
They only thing he had to say was, "motherfuck the world! "
