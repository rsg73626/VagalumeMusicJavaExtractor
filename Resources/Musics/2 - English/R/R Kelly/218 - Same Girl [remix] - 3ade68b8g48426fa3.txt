And you just cant tell me that you didnt see that ring on her finger 
Im even tryna help her be a singer
Thats why she was at that party in Atlanta, When i told her ass not to go out to Chicago
While im out here doing my thing in Tallahassee 
Yall out here treating my wife like a straight hoe

Stunting hard looking like about a hundred grand
Ready to spend it all
