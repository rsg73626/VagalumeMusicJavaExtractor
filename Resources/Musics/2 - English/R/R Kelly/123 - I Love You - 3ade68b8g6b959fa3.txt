I LOVE YOU

[Intro]
Baby i love you ( i love you too )
You know i need you
Gotta have you ( what )
Cant be without you ( J.lo )

[R. Kelly]
Its like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
all i really want you to know is who i am
find me low key in the back of the club, roll with some fine females, rollin on dubs
you and me big pimpin on a shopping spree in L.A
papparatzis and critics who give a damn what they say

[J.Lo]
Boy i never knew i could feel they way i felt, when i met you i could never forget you
and boy when you look my way i realize more and more i adore your pretty eyes

Baby i love you, ( yeaahhh )
Baby i need you ( need you )

[J.Lo]
Papi, i got something to say to you
Blessed and cursed on the day that

And there comes a time in our lifes when things change, its a brand new day.
And baby ill spend it with you.

rear-drop-top bentley on somebodys highway,
who let me jump in some club on his vallet
got alittle smoke, got alittle drinks sittin in V.I.P
got alittle buzz on my hands up honeys feeling me
got that criss sittin on ice like a gansta lean
hands surrounding them like dice like security
at the party in the rich compton penthouse suite
all my thugs and me breath smelling like hennesey
got a few friends flying in from San Diego
its a suprise party for my homie J.Lo
I need you ( baby i love you )
I gotta have you babe ( baby i need you )
baby i love you ( i gotta have you )
ooo i swear i do ( cant be without you )

Ladies do you know what im talking about ( i gotta have you )
