I'M A FLIRT (REMIX) (FEAT. T.I., T-PAIN)

R. Kelly:
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick, on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man lookin at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and u trust her
Then don't bring her around me cuz (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin' like I supposed to
Shinin' like I supposed to
In the club, fuckin' wit honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a playa bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonderin' why all these playas tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, playa I'm gon holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt wit all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie u say she yo girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'ma be like, "cousin"
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch
Cuz hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

T.I.:
Hey homie, if u ain't gettin no money
U better keep her away from me ya dig.

Well if u love ya girl
And wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I seent u girl
Better treat your girl right
Cuz another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz u leave your wife
And I see ya wife
That be for real
How long u think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life
You just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me
Cuz u ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like u
Cuz u the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in da light
I noticed she was checkin' me
And diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thang
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair
Like we getting' in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
Cuz u might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt
The mclaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

T-Pain:
(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight, eights)
Then I be like girl u know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now u can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como se llamas lil' mama? mi llamo pain, what is yo name?
I'm feelin' yo vibe
And I'm hopin' u feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let u know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what u say
He's so fly
And yes, he's so coo
Hey shawty (hey shawty)

He mad cuz I'm lookin', but I already touched her

Now if u walk up in the club
Wit a bad chick
And she lookin' at me
Then I'm gon hit
Man jackin' for chicks
I tried to quit
But I'm playa homie
So I had to hit
While u buyin' her drinks (in the club)
Actin' like u (in love)
Stuntin' like u (all thug)
We was (switchin' numbers)
She lookin' at u when I walk by
U turn yo head, she wink her eye
I can't help if she checkin' for a platinum type of guy
She be callin' me daddy, and I be callin' her mommy
She be callin' u kelly, when yo name is tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinkin'
When u bring em round me (mane)
Let me remind u that I am the king of r&b (mane)
Do u know what that means
That means if u love yo chick
Don't bring her to the vip
Cuz I might leave wit yo chick
Just keepin' it real
It's a playa's feel
Don't take no bitch to the club when u just met her
Cuz I'm flirt wit her (right)
He gon flirt wit her (right)
And if she lickin' dat good shit
She gon flirt wit em
