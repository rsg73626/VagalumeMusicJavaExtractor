MIGHT BE MINE

A couple of days ago, I got a phone call
Saying 'how you mr. Kelly' I said 'who's this'
Then he sayd it's Tameka's lawyer, and am calling on her behalf, then he said I got some news, 
That I think you gonna know,
And then he said she's pregnant, and then I sat down real slow, then I sayd who's this again, 
He took a breathe and sayd you heard me the first time

Then I sayd wait a minute mister, 
we talking about the same girl and she's a stripper, 
You wrap us in a girl and she's a freaky, 
and how does she know that the baby belongs to me, 

Then he asked me I met her two months ago- I said yes, 
and he said it was in a club in Chicago, I sayd yes, 
He sayd he must be ready to raise it, 
Cause she says you the one she laid with, oh

There's a very good chance, that it might be mine (x4)

I hung up and called my lawyers, 
and I told them the situation, 
and the first question out they mouth, 
Was that did I sleep with the girl, 

At first I hesitated this and sayd yeah, 
When I tell 'em I hit it wrong, 
and then they sayd it might be a chance, 
That you may have to pay the course, I sayd good law, 

and then I put the phone and just thought about for a couple of seconds, 
They asked me I seen her recently, I sayd no, 
They sayd I used to her frequently, I sayd no, 
All I know is that I left the club with this lady, 
and now am here and the baby is maded

There's a very good chance that it might be mine (x4)

Man I can slap myself, for getting involved with this lady, 
If I can turn the hands back, I would have went home to my baby, 
Now I am caught up, in a misery late night creep, 
Now wait here lady, I get a picture and damn this Baby look just like me

There's a very good chance that it might be mine.
