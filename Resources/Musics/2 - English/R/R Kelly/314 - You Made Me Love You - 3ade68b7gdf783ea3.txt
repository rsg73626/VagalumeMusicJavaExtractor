I was just minding my business when
Ms. Purdy you came walking
My heart stopped said what is this just
As soon as you started talking
Something happened deep within me (well)
All of a sudden I got this feeling
A chill came from feet to head and then I
Turned away from you and said to myself
This is not supposed to happen brother youâ€™ve been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell


You made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (oh Lord) made me love you babe
Said you made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (good Lord) made me love you babe
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (said it wasnâ€™t in my plans) made me love you babe
Ooh, look at you


Said you must be one of the top models
Body curved like a pop bottle
Got me sweating like a boxer baby
I done stumbled up on a perfect lady (awww)
Could this be what heaven sent to me
An angel come to set me free
Love has been a stranger to me
And myself keeps telling me that
This is not supposed to happen brother youâ€™ve been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell


You made me love you
You made me love you babe, (oh yes) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (hoo) made me love you babe
Hey you made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (yeah)
Made me love you babe, (aw baby) made me love you babe
You made love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (aw love)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe


Said the power of love you see 
Are 10 billion wonders to me (like the moon and stars above)
Thereâ€™s a whole new world for my eyes to see (yes sir)
So much joy darling you put in me
And now the sun is shining where there used to be rain, oh Lord
And now no more loneliness, no more hurt, no more pain


You made whoo!
You made me love you


You made me love you babe, (hoo) made me love you babe (yes you did)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Hey you made me love you
You made me love you babe, (hey hey hey) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
You made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (I was minding my business)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
You made me love you yeah
You made me love you babe, (oh) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (yes sir) made me love you babe
You you you made me love you

Made me love you babe, (hey hey) made me love you babe
