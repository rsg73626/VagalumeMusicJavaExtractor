U SAVED ME

True stories
Miracles
True blessings
All because of love

I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then I look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now

Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years I've been straight

You saved me
Gave me a second chance
You saved me
You saved me

Now I've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to god that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said god's good
I just laugh at 'em

But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew

You saved me

Now I was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside I was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I
Knew it I was on my knees

Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't think I'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted christ that day
Halilujah now I'm free

You saved me

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said I'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves

(mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone

You saved me

You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooh you saved me

You gave me it was by grace you saved me
I'm so thankful that you looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me

No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me

You saved me
