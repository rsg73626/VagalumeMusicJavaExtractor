CONTAGIOUS

It's two a.m. just gettin' in about to check my message
No one has called, but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings somebody wants to borrow money
I two way her she don't hit me back something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her "Had she seen my baby?"
(Oh I) Drove my six around looking for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the tv on, and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turn the tv down 'cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings going on upstairs (yeah) 'cause I know nobody else lives here
As I get closer to the stairways all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming out

You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you've got
Then a man says: Sexy lady (ooh!), drive me crazy, drive me wild
I just can't believe this shit

I ran downstairs looked in the closet looking for that oooh!
Said a prayer 'cause only God knows what I'm gonna dooo!
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' not in my own damn house
Who would have thought she was creepin' with another man?
The down low happenin' to me all over again
And then I turned the tv down (tv down) 'cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Something going on up there upstairs 'cause I know that no one else lives here
As I get closer to the stairways all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming

You're contagious, touch me baby (touch me), give me what you've got (yea..)
Sexy lady, (then I heard another man) drive me crazy, drive me wild
I just can't believe this shit
