SEXTIME

[Verse 1]
Got nowhere to be
Except right here with you and me
Phone's off no clock
Cause Imma hit it non stop
Baby
Yeah your body's talking and I'm listening
You've got my undivided attention
[?] they know me like the last meal
Heartbreak baby take me like an Advil woah
Chiop and screwed tonight we going slow
Wrap around that thing just like they do the pole
Cause you're the only thing on my schedule
Fuck a club, fuck a flight, girl tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Imma spend some time babe
Imma spend some time babe
Spend some time baby
Imma spend some time babe
Imma spend some time babe

[Chorus]
Spend a little sex time with you
(Oo baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Would you like that baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Baby just you and me)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Girl I want to spend some)
Spend a little sex time with you
Spend a little sex time with you
(Spend a little time)
Spend a little sex time with you
Baby

[Verse 2]
Let's get away from population
Take your body on a sex vacation
You like the rain on a window pain
I'm going down baby say my name
Time don't exist when we're alone
Girl welcome to the hour zone
I be hitting it hard from the back till the wall shake
It's so damn good I declare this night a holiday
Your love is sweet and I gotta crave it
Imma need an extra hour in it daylight saving
Tonight I'm trying to be a slave
Tell the whole world it can wait cause

[Pre-Chorus]
Imma spend some time babe
(Yeah)
Imma spend some time babe
(Would you like that girl)
Imma spend some time babe
(Imma spend some time)
Imma spend some time babe
(I wanna spend some time)

[Chorus]
Spend a little sex time with you
(With you baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Would you like that girl)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Baby just you and me)
Spend a little sex time with you
(See I just wanna spend a little)
Spend a little sex time with you
(With you baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(With you baby)

[Verse 3]
And I be
Filling up your body baby
My work my pleasure you're my business and my hobby baby
You're the call, I'm the answer
Thin walls
With the neighbours
Man I been up for two days
Murder murder 48
You no longer have to wait

[Chorus]
Spend a little sex time with you
(With you baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Spend a little time with you baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(So you can get some loving baby)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Cause we won't need to steal away)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Let's steal away)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Come on let's steal away)
Spend a little sex time with you
(Let's steal away)
Spend a little sex time with you
And get some sex time
We can get some sex time
