GORILLA (REMIX)

Yeah, it's for real
And you are all getting fucked up in other world
It is all girls I am in luck
Say hello to your sisters
And let's try some yoga
I'm Yoda, it's cool but let's get poppin' like soda
One will make a bridge and two will make a pros up
One will do the down dog and I will be the cobra
And it's any RD with the party's never sorry
Know, hella
I take 'em to the head, not to the bed
And set the ready, gorilla

Ooh I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
