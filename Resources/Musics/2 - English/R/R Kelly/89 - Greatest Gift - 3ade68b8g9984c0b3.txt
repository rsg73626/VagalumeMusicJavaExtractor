If you got the Christmas Spirit then sing this
I want to make love for Christmas

We don't have to contemplate, girl
'Cause we know what we're here for
We don't need to talk about it, baby
Just come on in and close the door, girl
This holiday makes it a time for giving
So let's lay down and let me express my feelings

When it comes down to the holidays
make no mistake I know that
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Christmas Trees and all these things
are very dear to me girl but
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Oh I love writing letters, decorating
taking toasts and celebrating, girl but your
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
So let's unwrap tonight
Your lovin' is the greatest gift
Make love until the morning light, girl
Your lovin' is the greatest gift

This holiday was made for giving, girl
So open up and let me get into your lovin'
through the night, girl

I promise on this Christmas Night

Who needs a fantasy
When I'm lyin' here with my dream come true
This holiday was meant for givin', girl
So give me your love, baby
Give me your love, baby, tonight
