BACK TO THE WAY WE WERE

Girl I'm missing you,eh
Once I'm missing you
(chorus)

Let's go back to the way
Back to the way,back to the way we were
Back to the way, back to the way,back to the way we were
Let's go back to the way
Back to the way,back to the we were
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?

(verse 1)
Girl,I hope you're lying next to me when  I wake up
I hope you're in the bathtoom,taking a shower girl
When I wake up
I said I hope you're in the kitchen
Girl when I wake up
Cause if you' re not doing those then
I don't wanna wake up
See just wanna make up
Never wanted to break up
Can't we just make love
Come on let's fix this thing up?
Cause I'm lost without you
Girl I'm about lose it
If I'm not with you
Then I can't hear my music
The seasons won't chance
Baby girl unlees come back to me
And undo this pain
Said I'm praying,heaven please
Rewind then nights,erase that fight
Because I see the light
So let's make it right

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Girl I'll give anything to have you back again
And I'll do anything to feel the
Touch of your wind beneath my wings
Cause all I wanna do is fly again
So baby can we try again?
And this time I'll be a perfcet loving man
(I promise)
Cross my heart and hope to god
You'll understand
And I'm gonna be good to you
And I'm never gonna lie to you
And I'm never leave,and I'm never gonna hurt
And I'm never gonna cheat on you
You don't have to think on it
Baby you can beg on it
Girl it's like church when I say it
The seasons won't change
Baby girl unlees you come back to me
And undo this pian
Said I'm praying,heaven please
Rewind that night,erase that fight
Because I see the light
So let's make it right girl

(chorus)

(I'm trying...)
I'm trying to call you
But you won't answer
I need to get through
Through your heart girl
And I'm not gonna go nowhere
Until you pick it up girl
I'm coming to get you babe
And bring you back here
And let you'll talk to me and I'll listen
If you're not in my life
Then baby girl there's something missing

(chorus)2x
