PLAYAS GET LONELY

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too

From my iPhone
To my sidekick
Jet planes
Schedule hectic
My love life
I neglect it
Had a fast car
But I wrecked it
Plenty chances
To fall in love
So many weekends
I went to clubs
In the fast lane
My life's
A picture flick
Let my drink decide
Who is
The next chick
I aint gone lie
On the plane
It don't matter to me
She say she me love me
But it's just chit
Chatter to me
But deep inside
I was always
Missing something
But I'm a thug
So I'm always
On something
So many girls
Always drinking
And having fun
Life's a beauty shop
And I keep
My hair done
Seems like
I'm on
A marry go ride
And it makes a thug
Want to settle down

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
(And you know I do)

I want to settle down
With you
Baby you and me
Life that's brand new
Quit running
These streets
Take away your pain
Chase away the rain
Off my love game
I might even
Change my name

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
(And you know I do)

Uh, uh
V.I.P.
Uh, uh
I will be
Always
In the spot light
Living the good life
All of that suckers
Still just aint right
Videos and all
Of these interviews
All I really want
Is to be next to you
I spend more time
With my car now
Land
Of the Hollywood sign
I'm a star now
My life is more
Than the cars
And awards
It gets lonely
And I can't ignore
Always in the streets
Going hardcore
I spend
A couple of G's
When I'm bored

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Playas get lonely
Too, too
(And you know I do)

More
Flying sticks
With lonely
Flying sticks
With birds grass
Flying sticks with
Nobody
To share it with
Out of all
After parties
I still need
Somebody
To be there
When a playas
Going through
Some shit
To be there
When a playas
Can't ever see

Sometimes
