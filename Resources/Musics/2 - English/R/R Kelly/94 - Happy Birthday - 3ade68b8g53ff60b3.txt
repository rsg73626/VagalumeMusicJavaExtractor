HAPPY BIRTHDAY

She gon' hit the club
She 'bout to turn up
She with her whole crew
And it seem like she ready

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)

She got a friend, and they kissin' each other
They goin' in, they all on each other
They takin' shots, now they down for whatever
She's a good girl, but tonight she a stripper
She got a man, but that nigga ain't with her
I give her a bottle like I was her babysitter

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)

I'm up in the section, we got bottle service
And it's full of them goons, and these bitches is twerkin'
And you know that I'm flexin' (throwin' my money)
Yeah, I light up the room
I'm flyer than yours (haters can't touch me)
Man, I'm in my zone
My swagger the bank, they keep coming for loans
Got a taste for them redbones (strippers especially)
I'm fucking started
It is my b-day
And this is my fiftieth car

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
You're looking so good for your birthday
I want to celebrate with you

Take this whole party to my hotel
And baby you can bring your crew
Got a house in the hills and my life
Is a window, I'll show you the view
Yeah, my audemars says it's time
To pop bottles and get in the pool
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
