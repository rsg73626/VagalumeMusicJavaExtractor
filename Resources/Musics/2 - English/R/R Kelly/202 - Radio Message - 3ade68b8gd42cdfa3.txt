RADIO MESSAGE

This is a radio message to my baby,
And I'm begging her
Come back, come back,
Come back, come back,
Come back

I'm sorry that I made you cry
I'm sorry for the rest of my life
And I'm sorry that I hurt you
And I'm sorry for lying to you

And I'm lost without you,
'Cause I'm all about you,
'Cause you're here to stay
Oh my, oh me
I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend
Can you hear me, can you forgive me
I don't want no tickets, no limo ride
I'm the next caller on the line

This is a radio message to my baby,
And I'm begging her
Come back, come back
Come back, please come back.
Won't you come back?
This is a radio message to my baby,
And I'm begging her
Come back, come back, baby
Come back, come back
Come back

And I'm sorry for treating you that way,
I'm sorry for all of those silly mistakes
Sorry I didn't to what I promised
And I'm sorry you're sorry that we ever met.

And I'm lost without you,
'Cause I'm all about you,
'Cause you're here to stay
Oh my, oh me

I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend,
Can you hear me girl, can you forgive me
Cause I don't want no tickets, no limo ride
I'm the next caller on the line

And this is a radio message to my baby,
And I'm begging her
Come back, come back, baby
Come back, come back
Come back

Somebody let this record just rotate
'Til my baby come back, let it rotate
Cause I need, I need her right back with me
So let it rotate
Whatever it takes to play this record
I need her to hear this record
So please, let it rotate
Oh because I'm the next caller on the line

And this is a radio message to my baby,
And I'm begging her
Come back, come back
Come back, come back.
Come back
This is a radio message to my baby,
Begging her
Come back, come back baby,
Come back
I need you to come back
I need you to come back

Need you, come back

Baby come back home
Please
