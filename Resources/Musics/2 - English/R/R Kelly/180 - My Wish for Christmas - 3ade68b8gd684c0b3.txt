MY WISH FOR CHRISTMAS

My wish for Christmas, that family's Ok
My wish for Christmas, that the whole world is safe
My wish for Christmas, that love conquers hate
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays

My wish for Christmas, the homeless finds a home
My wish for Christmas, that we all just get along
My Christmas wish is the joy conquers pain
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays

My Christmas wish is someone to give a care
My Christmas wish is that Heaven answers prayers
'Cause I never needed anything like I need the world to change
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays

I never needed anything like I need the world to change
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays
Yeah
