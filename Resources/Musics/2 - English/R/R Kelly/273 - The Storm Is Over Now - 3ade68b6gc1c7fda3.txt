THE STORM IS OVER NOW

I was in a tunnel
And couldn´t see the light
And whenever I´d look up
I couldn´t see the sky
Sometimes when I´m standing
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin´
Dead in the middle of a smile

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help ´cause
I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin´

Refrain:
The storm is over
The storm is over now
And I can see the sunshine
Somewhere beyond the clouds
I feel Heaven, yeah
Heaven is over me
Come on and set me free

Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I´ve been racin´ for years
And still no finish line

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help ´cause
I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin´

Refrain

Somehow my beginning
Stepped right in
Then faith became my friend
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it´s sayin´
sayin´

Refrain(2x)

Looks I can see the light shining(4x)
