TEXT ME

Eeehh, aaahhh
Text me back something freaky (freaky), 
Let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, so baby text it to my phone (yeah) 

Hey, how you doing, 
Shawty what you doing 
I ain't got nothing to do tonight 
So I wanna get with you tonight
Be at my crib at 7
I hit it 7 to 11
And wear that thing I like
And I'll do that thing you like
It ain't nobody at my home
So we can get freaky as we want
We can play, sex all day, get it in, (sayin)

(Chorus)
Text me back something freaky (freaky), 
Let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, so baby text it to my phone (yeah) 

Text me back something freaky (freaky), 
Shawty let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, so baby text it to my phone
Ay, I'm on that booty call, I'm on that booty call(ohhh)
I'm on that booty call, I'm on that booty call (ayyyyy)

So text me how you feel
And shawty keep it real
Are you gonna wind that for me?
Are you gonna grind that on me?
Are you gonna give me a lap dance while you in them hot pants?
Sink sink deep into your middle like it's quick sand
Let me make it do what it do
I'm glad you like that kinky shit too
Kissing on your back, I know you like that
Drip drip drip with the candle wax
Turn off both our phones so can't nobody call us
No clothes on while we in the mirror
You scream, I'm in
Girl come over here

(Saying)

(Chorus)
Text me back something freaky (freaky), 
Let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, so baby text it to my phone (yeah) 

Text me back something freaky (freaky), 
Shawty let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, so baby text it to my phone
Ay, I'm on that booty call, I'm on that booty call(ohhh)
I'm on that booty call, I'm on that booty call (ayyyyy)

So text me how you feel (Aaah)
And shawty keep it real
Text me all the things you're gonna do to me 
And don't hold nothing back 
Whatever it may be
Girl jump in your ride and come see me (Yeah)

Text me back something freaky, 
Let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, so baby text it to my phone (yeah)
Text me back something freaky, 
Let me know just how you wanna do me, 
I'm at home, sipping on Patron, 
I'm all alone, (I'm at my home) so baby text it to my phone 
Ay, I'm on that booty call, I'm on that booty call (ohhh), 
I'm on that booty call, I'm on that booty call (ayyyyy)

And shawty keep it real (fadeout)
