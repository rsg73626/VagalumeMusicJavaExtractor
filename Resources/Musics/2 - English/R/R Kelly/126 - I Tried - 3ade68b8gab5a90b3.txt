I TRIED

You shut down when I'm trying to fix it
We both know the end result shit
And we've both done our share of wrong dear
You lock me out
You cast me to the underworld
Talk to me suddenly
you're judging everything I do
But you want me to be honest with you
But you ain't trying to be honest with me
So Selfish
But despite everything

I tried, yeah, I tried, yeah
I tried, yeah, I tried, yeah
But I can't but I can't
but I can't but I can't let you go
Oh no, let you go, oh no

Is this just a test of my strength
The way you come at me yeah
Point your finger how are we going to last
If we keep dwelling on the past
You say you're hurting
Well I get frustrated too
But the bottom line is what do we do
I wish that you were in my shoes
But I want you to be honest with me
Sometimes I can't just be honest with you
So selfish
But despite everything
Despite everything yeah

I tried, yeah, I tried, yeah
I tried, yeah, I tried, yeah
But I can't but I can't
but I can't but I can't let you go
Oh no, let you go, oh no

Shorty listen to me
Let's talk not scream
Chips fall down we can get em right back up
Turn things around chairs gonna change our luck
Girl count your blessings
We can have it all right now
You ain't gotta question
My heart is where you are right now
Let's make love
Don't talk ok, let's just make love
Don't walk away
But I need us to be honest with us
Sometimes it's so hard for us to trust
So stubborn
But girl despite everything
Despite everything

I tried, yeah, I tried, yeah
I tried, yeah, I tried, yeah
But I can't but I can't
but I can't but I can't let you go
Oh no, let you go, oh no

See I tried
And you cried
But I can't let you go
