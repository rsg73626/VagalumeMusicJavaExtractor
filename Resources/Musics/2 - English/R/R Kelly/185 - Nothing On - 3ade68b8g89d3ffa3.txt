NOTHING ON

Hey baby, I'm back!
Seems like I've been gone for a while!
But I'm coming over now!
Right now!

Forget the lingerie girls lets keep the g string
Don't wear no silk gowns
Tonight no tears hereâ€¦ no earrings or bracelets
Once I walk in, I wanna see your body naked

Skin is all I wanna see
Girl, you look so good to me
Girl that body turns me on,
Tonight I wanna see you with (nothing on!)

Girl I wanna see you with (nothing on!)
No playboy bunny outfit
Girl all I wanna know is you're all alone
Sitting there with nothing on.

Now you look good in your boy shorts
And your smilly face panties
But tonight is different, I just wanna see body
Don't come to the door in a towel,
Just come straight out of shower
I hope that you're ready cause I'll be hitting it for hours.

Skin is all I wanna see
Girl, you look so good to me
Girl that body turns me on,
Tonight I wanna see you with (nothing on!)

Girl I wanna see you with (nothing on!)
No playboy bunny outfit
Girl all I wanna know is you're all alone
Sitting there with nothing on.

Girl I heard .. my cell going on
Fifty per cent on lingerie, oh!
And I know you like to shop there,
But tonight we're going nowhere
Girl, this ain't a pajama party
You don't need no underwear
We gonna pull up in your drive way
Get up out my coupe, baby
Open the door, oh my goodness, turn around
I know just where to put it(nothing on)

Girl I wanna see you with (nothing on)
No playboy bunny outfit
Girl all I wanna know is you're all alone
Sitting there with nothing on.
