FLYIN' ON MY SLEIGH

Ooh baby, come on baby
Come on with me, baby

Tonight we'll both be flyin'
Grab a hold, let me take you to heaven
Makin' love on a bed of clouds
Take you up with me baby
And we're never comin' down
And I'm gonna fill your stocking with sweet things
'Tis the season, girl, for eternity
Ooh baby, come with me

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
Flyin' on my sleigh, baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh, baby

Ooh, take my hand
From this room I can take you to Christmas Land
I wanna give you all of your gifts, baby
And we don't need a tree, all we need is you and me
And I'm gonna fill your stocking with sweet things
'Tis the season, girl, for eternity
Ooh baby, won't you come with me

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh, baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh, baby

Jingle Bells all the way
Take it to the top, baby don't you stop
Lost in this Christmas groove
And the greatest Christmas gift is you

I wanna take you glidin'
We'll be floatin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh, baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
As we're flyin' on my sleigh, baby

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
Flyin' on my sleigh, baby
We'll be touchin'
We'll be kissin'
Flyin' on my sleigh, baby

We'll be glidin'
We'll be floatin'
Flying on my sleigh, baby
We'll be touchin'
