I'M STILL HERE

Don't say goodbye to me
There is no need to
Don't say goodbye to me
Because I'm still with you
Don't say goodbye to me
Don't shed a tear
Because I'm... still... here

Go light a candle
And say a prayer
Scream out 'Victory'
Because love is still there
Smile at the memories, yeah
All through the years
Because I'm still here

Take all I've given you
Keep it inside
And when you feel lonely
I'm right by your side
And when the storm comes, yeah
Have no fear
Because I'm still here

So walk with your head up
And be strong
Just remember that you're not alone
I'm smiling down on you, my dear
Remember, Daddy's... still... here
