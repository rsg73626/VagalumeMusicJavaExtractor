TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET CH. 3

Well,here we are the four of us,
in total shock me and her,
I close my mouth,and swollow spit, 
as I'm thinking to myself this is some deep shit,
then I said so your gonna tell me he's the one
you've been talking to,
he says yes, I says no, he says yes, I says no,
he says it's the truth,
I yell "all of ya'll asses crazy,
let me up out this door", cause this is way
more than I bargoned for, 
and then she says wait, 
I'm sure we can all fix this, then I said i'm late,
Cuz I ain't got a damn thing to do with this

Then she said wouldn't you like to know 
just how it all began,
then I thought to myself and said quick you got 3 minutes,
then it got real quite,
I said somebody start talkin, 
And then she said "My God Ruphus, I got just one question, 
HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I"M SO HURT?!?!"
he looked at her and said bitch please you got
yo nerve, with all yo club poppin'
lying sayin' you was shoppin',
and now here you are in 
our home, and you calling
me wrong, she said ok you busted me,
and that much I agree,
you caught me cheating,
but this a little extreme,
he said you are my wife,
sleeping behind my back,
and now I come home and you got him in the closet,
how extreme is that?

She says but she's a he,
then he says please you can't judge me,
she says Ruphus this is crazy,
and I said stop arguing,
I did not stay here to hear yall chew
each other out, so get to the point,
or I swear I'm out, excuse me please,
but I think I can explain what's going in
here, my name is Chuck, and I've been 
knowin' Ruphus for bout a year,
at midnight creeping around with him it's been a living hell,
sneaking in and out of hotels,
I said brother spare me 
the details, then Ruphus said Chuck please,
don't say nothin' else, then she screams Ruphus
you son of a bitch,
and he says Cathy go to hell,
I said I thought you name was Mary,
that's what you said at the party,
man this is getting scary,
I'm gonna shoot somebody

Then Ruphus starts yellin' and screaming
saying Cathy this is all yo fault,
she throws a pillow at him
and says you was creepin' too the only difference 
is you didn't get caught,
Chuck screams out we're in love
Cathy says love my a**
Ruphus says we're gettin' married
then I shoot one in the air,
then I say not another one of 
you sons of bitches say a word,
cause all of this shit I'm going through
is unheard, grab my celluar,
sayin' this is so wrong,
call up my home,
and a man picks up the phone
