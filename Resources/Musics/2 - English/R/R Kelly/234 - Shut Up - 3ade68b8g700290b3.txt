SHUT UP

[Intro]
This song goes out
To all the people out there that be runnin' their mouth
And don't know what the hell they sayin'
Shut up

[Verse 1]
Now that I've got my voice back
let me start off by saying that
I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back
And I just wanna thank God upstairs
for keepin' his hands on me
And for keeping all the doctors' focus during my surgery
Now, there's a couple of things I've gotta get off my chest
Some serious issues that I must address
Well lets just get right to it
People said that I was done
Said there was no way this time he's gonna overcome
And even before the doctors were done
and I could awake
A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away
After twenty two years of a blessed career
They had me lyin' in my hospital bed
cryin' mad tears (woo hoo hoo)
But just as I had many people hatin' me
I had so many people lovin' me
And lets not forget the hood
around the world coverin' me
But to everybody that be callin' me
tellin' me what they be sayin' about me
Bringin' me all of this negative shit
y'all the ones I ain't fuckin' with
It's time for me to evaluate the people
that I let up in my space
Can I get a witness for all of this
people all up in your business

[Hook
Tell em, shut up
Tell em, shut up
Tell em, shut up
I'm talkin' to you

[Verse 2]
He's washed up, he's lost it, he ain't got it no more
Well I'm here to tell you today
boy you haters are so slow
And it saddens me to know
some of y'all want me to go away
But when it's time for me to go
my God is gonna orchestrate
Until then, I will accept the stones
and pray and just try and get along
But sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong
I got kids and I'm tryna love em
So many things I'm tryna juggle
But I never thought this music
would become my struggle
The news said I lost my house
My own people put me down
And my friends no longer around no
But you see deep underneath the surface
Now it feels that something's working in my behalf
a victory is near
See my future ain't my past
it's not the end of the hourglass
Who said it would not last?
Fans, sick their ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now seriously after all these hits
and melodies and memories
You compare me to someone else, O-M-G
No offense to the other artist, but come on dog
lets be honest
How many babies been made off me? O-M-G
Seriously, you're gon' act like that
Sit there like there ain't no truth to that
Lookin' at me like I'm not talkin' stats, O-M-G
Every boy, every girl, every child around the world
From the 90s up until today was made off me

Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm talkin' to you
Shut up, bout my life
(?)
So just shut up, just shut up
