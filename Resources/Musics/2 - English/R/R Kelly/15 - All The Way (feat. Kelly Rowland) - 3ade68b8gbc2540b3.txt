ALL THE WAY (FEAT. KELLY ROWLAND)

(trecho)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're gonna let it smoke, smoke
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I wanna hit that

Oh oh oh oh oh oh (wanna hit this)
We're gonna let it smoke, smoke
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let's go

It's 3 AM and I'm not with him
It's the moment that I know we've both been waiting for
Now we can pretend we're together again
And the thought play, it's all chills, can't control it
We ain't supposed to be doing this
We know the consequence
We're passed the limit
And there ain't no turning back now
You already got my body gripped
Yeah, boy, you know I love that shit
Said we're passed the limit
And there ain't no turning back now

Might as well go all the way
There ain't no such thing as half mistake
So boy, we might as well, might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way, might as well go all the way

You don't know if you're addicted
Till you relapse from de-tox
Of loving each other and just for an hour or two or three
Till 6 in the morning
Do you have a good excuse to be on the down low
With me, I'mma tell it sweet
You know that we supposed to be doing this
We know the consequence
We're passed the limit
And there ain't no turning back now
I already got the Magnum glove
You already got your ass poked up
So we're passed the limit
And there ain't no turning back, no

Might as well go all the way
There ain't no such thing as half mistake
So baby girl, we might as well, might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way, might as well go all the way
Like we did before

You don't know if you're addicted till you relapse
I'm right back smoking you
You're right back injecting me
We're always in our veins, made it
I'm right back smoking you
You're right back injecting me
Guess it ain't no cure, we might as well go all the way
You know you're wrong for this
And I know you've got somebody
But you are here, so we might as well do what we wanna do
Wanna feel good, to be back together
If only for a moment, I'm in it
For just one night, gotta hit it out the park again
Going, going, going gone
