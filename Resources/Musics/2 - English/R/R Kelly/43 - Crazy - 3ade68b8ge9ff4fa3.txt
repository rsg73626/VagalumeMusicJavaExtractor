CRAZY

(Chorus) 
I'm going crazy 
Feels like im losing my mind 
And I don't know what to do 
Seem like I run out of time 
I'm going crazy 
And the gorgeous ring I bought 
Man she don't have a clue that I'm having second thoughts 

(Verse 1)
Usher man quit playing get it together 
Make up your mind because 
This type of thing is forever 
This is the mirror speaking 
What the hell you gonna do 
What about the ladies and all of your fans and the prefans 
But I've been there done that and I'm looking for something else 
Somebody to settle down with to share all this wealth 
Ya, but once you see these bounds your locked(locked) 
Ya I know 
No more hanging on the block(block) 
Ya I know 
But the girl is down for me and the girl truly loves me 
And besides that is the real facts and they aint nothing in them streets 
What about the family(I know), what about the industry(I know), TV and magazines 
Shut up cause 

(Chorus) 
I'm going crazy 
Feels like im losing my mind 
And I don't know what to do 
Seem like I run out of time 
I'm going crazy 
And the gorgeous ring I bought 
Man she don't have a clue that I'm having second thoughts 

(Verse 2)
Usher, wait a minute before you say anything else 
Just think about this 
Five years down the line ya'll break up, and she can take half your shit(hold up) 
Let me interrupt I remind you were in love 
So back it up(oh) 
Easy killah, I'm just saying I hope you got a pre-nup(oh)

Said I wanted you to have my baby(ouh ouh) 
And forever to be my lady(ouh ouh) 
Ya man but understand this cris 
Hey, im just playing devils eyes again 
Ya, well I'm tired of you and everybody else 
So get the f*** outta my business 
Well what about your mama 
Even she don't want you to have this wife 
My momma manages my career, player and not my life 
What about the family(I know), what about the industry(I know), TV and magazines 
Shut up cause 

(Chorus) 
I'm going crazy 
Feels like im losing my mind 
And I don't know what to do 
Seem like I run out of time 
I'm going crazy 
And the gorgeous ring I bought 
Man she don't have a clue that I'm having second thoughts 

(Verse 3)
It will be all over the radio stations 
Girl, Usher got married, will he lose his fans
And I'll be on the radio stations 
Saying yes I got married, but I still love my fans 
And yes I believe they'll understand 
Are you 100 %(no) 
Are you sure this was meant(yes) 
Is she the one for you(yes) 
Is the love true(yes) 
Then what you waiting for(I dunno) 
Got a change of heart(no) 
Well get out there(whoe) and tell it now 

(Chorus) x2 
I'm going crazy 
Feels like im losing my mind 
And I don't know what to do 
Seem like I run out of time 
I'm going crazy 
And the gorgeous ring I bought 
Man she don't have a clue that I'm having second thoughts
