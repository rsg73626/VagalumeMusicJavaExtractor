COME TO DADDY

    


Oooooooooooh (I know what youâ€™re going through)
Come to me ( I can see it in tour eyes)
Oh baby (câ€™mon)
Come to daddy (you know I ain't got no problem with this)
Oooooh (just say the word, I come and get you)
Come to me, yeah
(whatever you want me to do, Iâ€™ll do it for you)

Well itâ€™s obvious to me that he donâ€™t love you
Baby canâ€™t you see Iâ€™m that player for you
Baby talk to me help me understand
How can you go on fed up with this man
Go it out your way to make him happy
Gonâ€™appreciate all that you give
Time to take a stand no more second chance
If you feel this way than baby take my hand

Chorus	Come to daddy let me
Please your body tonight
(since he) Since wonâ€™t do it right
Come to daddy let me (let me)
Please your body tonight 
(since he) Since he wonâ€™t do it right   

It sounds like everything you do for him just stop right
Same got down excuse
Gotta have it tonight
How can you egnore
The slamminâ€™of the door
Open up your eyes itâ€™s not the same no more
Girl you need a life someoneâ€™s gonna love you
Treat you like a guide let you free at guide you
Time to say ok
About to make a change
Donâ€™t mean no player hate
But baby come my way

Chorus 

All I wanna do is get next to you
Baby I can understand what youâ€™re going through
It donâ€™t have to be this way if you donâ€™t want it to
Baby call him up and tell him that â€œIâ€™m leaving youâ€™

Chorus 2x
