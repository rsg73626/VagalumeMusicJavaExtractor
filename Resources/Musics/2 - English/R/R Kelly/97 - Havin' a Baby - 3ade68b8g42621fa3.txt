HAVIN' A BABY

[verse 1]
What is this news u got to tell me
Girl, What has got u so excited
Why Would u call me on my job
When I'm right in the middle of writing
See U've got this look up on ur face
Spit it out girl I just cannot wait
To get whatever it is up out of u
So Tell me Girl, What it do

[Bridge]
I'll give u a hint
It crawls fore it walks
in a couple of years
It begins 2 talk
and it makes us so happy
Girl r u telling me...

[Chorus]
I'm havin a baby
(Oh, I am so happy)
I'm havin a baby
(and im so glad 2 be that baby's daddy)
I'm havin a baby

(A lil girl, a lil boy, a lil u, a lil me)
I'm havin a baby
(girl it doesn't matter as long as it's healthy)

[verse 2]
while I can't believe I'm gonna be a father
In 9 months a child will be born
Baby, ur pregnant in April
Which means we're havin a capricorn
I'm so glad 2 be apart of this
cuz girl a child is heaven sent
this is a blessing 2 me
2 have u with my seed

[chorus]
I'm havin a baby
(Girl I'm so glad that...)
I'm havin a baby
(And I'm so proud 2 be that baby's daddy)
I'm havin a baby
(A lil girl, A lil boy, A lil u, A lil me)
I'm havin a baby
(Girl it doesn't matter as long as it's healthy)

[Hook]
Girl u got me Staring at u from head 2 toe
When I look at u, it's like u've got this glow
So much respect i got 4 u
Girl since u told me what's good
Ever since u told me I love u more
Girl, what I feel is so spiritual
And baby our lives have been changed
Now I want u 2 have my last name

[chorus]
