V.I.P.

Rock on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Chillinâ€™ at the club
Showing niggas how we ball
Ever since the drought
Itâ€™s been nothing but the trump

Can you really blame me for getting these Gâ€™s
Something I donâ€™t understand
Why you fools after me, VIP
Got the haters after me
Cuz I push these Vâ€™s
They wanna be like me
If you agree
Then raise the roof with me
In the party place to be
Living VIP

Since when did money, oh
Become such a problem
I just wanna live a life
That only involve the numbers, yeah

Can you really blame me for getting these Gâ€™s
See what I canâ€™t understand
Why you fools donâ€™t rock with me, VIP
I got the haters after me 
Because I push these Vâ€™s
They wanna be like me
If you agree (If you agree)
Then raise the roof with me (Raise the roof with me)
In the party place to be (In the party place to be)
Living VIP 

[Tone]
Ha ha, nothing but the
Stretch Bentleys with the top thats drop, that's right
Kelly CDâ€™s with the sound that knocks
Di di di di di di di
When the party rocks
Fingers to the wrist filled with nothin but rocks
I know you haters wanna come to Rocklandâ€™s party
But you canâ€™t get in unless you VIP

Can you really blame me for getting these Gâ€™s
See what I canâ€™t understand
Why you fools are after me, livin' V
So if you're ballinâ€™ and you know, raise your hands
And if you sexy and you know it, stomp your feet
And if your man ainâ€™t spendinâ€™ money on you
Then ladies, you can come and get with me
A little V

[R]
Yo, uh huh, wish I could call up all the haters
I mean, I wish I could make a phone call 
To all the haters around the world
You know what Iâ€™m saying?
This is what I'd say
Whatâ€™s goinâ€™ on in the world today, huh?
Seems like every nigga got beef cuz they ainâ€™t got steak 
When I ainâ€™t had no money see, everything was cool
But now that I got a little money and yâ€™all wanna act a fool
And none of â€˜em VIP

VIP, I got the haters after me
Because I push these Vâ€™s (What?)
They wanna be like me (Raise the roof, yâ€™all)
If you agree (Now let's lock)
And raise the roof with me
(Over this here's, just bring it on)
In the party place (Uh, Rockland)
To be living VIP, VIP

I got the haters after me
Because I push these Vâ€™s
They wanna be like me
(Wanna be a.....)
