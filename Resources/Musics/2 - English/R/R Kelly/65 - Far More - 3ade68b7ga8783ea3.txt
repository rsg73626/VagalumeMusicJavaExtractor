FAR MORE

Mansions, Hills, and Acres

Women, Drinks, and Caterers

I will toast intil the Break of Dawn

Swimming Pools and Strippers

Conversation, Six figures 

Never crossed my mind to call home....


(chorus)
There's a note on the bathroom mirror
Telling me that you had enough
It took you leavin me for my blind eyes to see 
That you mean 
(far more)
Than this planet to me
(far more)
Than the air i breath
(far more)
From here to overseas
(far more)
Girl, you're all i need
(far more)
Than the mountains and tree
(far more)
You mean more than the birds and bees
(far more)
Honey take it from me
(far more)
You are all i need


Hanging out with friends

Never calling to check in

Neglecting you in every way.

Taking the home front for granted

What was straight now is slanted

And i don't know what to do about this letter

(chorus)
There's a note on the bathroom mirror
Telling me that you had enough
It took you leavin me for my blind eyes to see 
That you mean 
(far more)
More than this planet to me
(far more)
More than the air i breath
(far more)
From here to overseas
(far more)
Girl, you're all i need
(far more)
Than the mountains and tree
(far more)
Than the birds and bees
(far more)
Honey take it from me
(far more)
You are all i need

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Skiddle-ee bee bop
Hip hop 

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop,
Skiddle-ee, bee bop
Hip hop 

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop,
Skiddle-ee, bee bop
Hip hop 
Far more, far more

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Skiddle-ee bee bop
Hip hop 

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop,
Skiddle-ee, bee bop
Hip hop 

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop,
Skiddle-ee, bee bop
Hip hop 
Far more to me.....

(chorus)
There's a note on the bathroom mirror
Telling me that you had enough
It took you leavin me for my blind eyes to see 
That you mean 
(far more)
More than this planet to me
(far more)
More than the air i breath
(far more)
From here to overseas
(far more)
Girl, you're all i need
(far more)
Yeah
(far more)
Ever since you been gone
(far more)
I've realized girl
(far more) 
Just what it is I had at home
(far more)
Oh, baby you mean far more
(far more)
Than this planet to me
(far more)
Than this air i breathe
(far more)
Nothing can compare
(far more)
To your love for me
(far more)
To your love for me
(far more)
To your love for me
(far more)
To your love for me
*fade out*
