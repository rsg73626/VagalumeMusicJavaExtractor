TAKE MY TIME TONIGHT

[Intro]:
Hey baby
I want you to do me a favor
I want you to take all of your thoughts
All of your worries and problems and forget about em
Because tonight is about me and you

[Verse 1]:
No cellulars no pagers no two-ways just us
No phone calls no messages no family no friends
I just wanna be alone with you (alone)
Girl I just wanna get it on with you (yeah)
I'll disappear and I'll leave a clue (here's what I wanna do baby)

[Chorus]:
I just wanna take my time tonight
Holdin your body tight keepin you warm 
Nothin's gonna stop this feeling
I'll be giving you sexual healing
I just wanna take my time tonight
Holdin your body tight keepin you warm
Nothin's gonna stop this feeling
I'll be giving you sexual healing

[Verse 2]:
No bill collecters no landlords
Your boss is trippin just ignore it
You got plans call em off
The CD take it off pause
I just wanna be alone with you (oh because)
Girl I just wanna get it one with you (you yeah
Disappear and I'll leave a clue (here's what I wanna do babe)

[Chorus]

I really really want you baby
Really really want you baby
Really really want you baby
Said I want you
Really really want you baby (hope you want me like I want you)
Really really want you baby (ooh baby)
Really really want you baby (sexy lady)
