THE WORLD'S GREATEST

Yeah, uh, uh
Yeah
It's the world's greatest
It's the world's greatest
C'mon, yeah
The world's greatest

I am a mountain, I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind sweepin' the country
I am a river down in the valley, oh
I am a vision and I can see clearly

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

(The world's greatest, yo)
(The world's greatest ever)

I am a giant, I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion, down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band, I am the people, oh
I am a helping hand, I am a hero

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

In the ring of life I'll reign love
And the world will notice a king
When all is darkest, I'll shine a light
And the mirrors of success reflect in me

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

It's the greatest
Can you feel it
It's the greatest
Can you feel it
