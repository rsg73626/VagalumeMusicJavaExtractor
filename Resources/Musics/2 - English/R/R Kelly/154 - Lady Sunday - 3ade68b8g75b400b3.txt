LADY SUNDAY

La da da da da, la la
Oh yeah, yeah

Where there's no sun, there is that girl
She is the one, that spins my world
When I am down, she makes it better
When there are clouds, she change the weather
Not wishing well, oh my peace and my glory
As a fairytale, then she is my story
When I feel drained, her love is like a fountain
And when I'm weak, she cam move mountains

[Chorus]
I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy, this way
Till my lady Sunday, came

Oh I am her crown and he is my sky
If life is a rope, then she is my ride
When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling
When I am sick she brings me healing
Whenever I call, she is right there
And when I fall, she says a prayer
When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it
And … to sing, this is music

[Chorus]
I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy, this way
Till my lady Sunday, came

La da da da, miss got me, miss righteous, …
Take my hand and be my missus future
Cause your loving makes the groove much better
As long as we got music, as we got music
As long as we got music, we'll dance forever

[Chorus] X 2
I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy, this way
Till my lady Sunday, came.
