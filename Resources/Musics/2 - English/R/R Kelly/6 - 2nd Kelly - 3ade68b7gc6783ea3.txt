2ND KELLY

Hey yo, R. 
Let me handle my business
I just wanna take over the show for a minute
Not the whole show, just a little bit

Now that heâ€™s outta the way 
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Can I break it down and break you off 
Some of this computer lovinâ€™ type of shit
Lookinâ€™ at you from the inside of this internet
Iâ€™m in the mood, and my tongue is in the mood
Ladies, can we have a little fun?
Can we play a little game?
Said, can we have a little fun?
Can we play a little game?

I got something for yâ€™all 
Can I give it to you?

Now listen, 2nd kelly what you got for me, yâ€™all say
I got some down low, down low, sing it for me
Now 2nd kelly, what you got for me, yâ€™all say
I got some 12 play, 12 play, sing it
Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, sing
I got some bump and grind, bump and grind, sing it yâ€™all
Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, say
Do you mind if I stroke you up
Do you mind if I stroke you down

Ladies, ladies, tell me do you want more?
I said do you want more?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na sing

Now yâ€™all having fun?
Too bad itâ€™s time for me to get up out of here
But before I do
I wanna blow the roof off this place with this last one
Are yâ€™all ready?
All right, now everybody let me hear you say
Ooh na na na na na na
Ooh na na na na na na
Yeah, now, that was loud, right? 
But I think yâ€™all can get a little louder
If yâ€™all what Kelly to come back out here
With what he about to get dressed in
Yâ€™ll do it louder come on here we go, come on
Ooh na na na na an na what
Ooh na na na na na na 

I know yâ€™all must be trippinâ€™ on  me
Damn
I wanna go half on a baby
