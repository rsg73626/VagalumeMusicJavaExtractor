BETCHA GONNA KNOW (DEMO FOR MARIAH CAREY)

Oh, welcome to a day, of my life (of my life)
A memoir of an imperfect angel

It's nine o'clock, the a. m
I get out of bed, make some coffee for him
I take a shower, and fix some breakfast
But he don't eat, just sittin there reading the paper
I tried to talk to him, but he didn't have much to say
And then I threw some bread at him
but he did not want to play
And I did that dance I know he loves to see me do
If I was the sky, he'd never know that I was blue
His phone rings, he looks at me and says "Excuse me"
Walks in the room as if he didn't even know me
He comes back out, with a smirk on his face
Puttin on his clothes, I'm like "Can we do something today? "

He says "I got a meetin, it's im [ortant, I can't break it. "
I said "But baby please" he cut me off said "I can't make it. "
He runs out the door, pulls out the driveway
but he left his suitcase
Ahh, ahh, ahh ahh

(I checked) the phone
(I checked) the calls
(I checked) the home
(I checked) the cars
I checked
He's a lier, broke the code and read the text
I'm so glad I placed that bet
I want his answer 'cause he knows I checked

Look, I wouldnt've done it if he wasnt so ambitious
But he gave me every reason to be suspicious
Like, I'll call his phone, like, an he'll pick up, like
hang right back up, then right call back and say "what's up? "
I'm conteplating should I open his closet door?
Probable calls, bouta open his closet door
See what I can find, and if he's cheatin on me
First, I checked his pockets from his suit pants to his jeans
It's 6: 30 I hear him walkin in the house
I turn the tv on and hop up on the couch
He comes in, picks up the same clothes
then speaks, then heads back out the door

He says "I got a meetin, it's important, I can't break it. "
I said "But baby please--"
he cut me off said "I can't make it. "
Then leaves me again, it breaks my heart
Then he dropped a card
Ahh ahh, ahh ahh

(I checked) the phone
(I checked) the calls
(I checked) the home
(I checked) the cars
I checked
He's a lier, broke the code and read the text
I'm so glad I placed that bet
I want his answer 'cause he knows I checked

"Yea waddup, what's good watchu doin' here? "
"I need a favor (pshh) wait a minute please come back here! "

"Baby, I've got other plans. "
"But if you just give me a chance to talk to you
and let you know (yeah whatchu goin through with yo' man)
what I'm goin through with my man--"

"See baby girl I've done heard it all before (Ohh)
I'm superman, but I'm not saving you no more (Uhh)
Remember the last time, you were proven wrong... "

"Yeah but only this time he forgot his phone--"

"What? That's his? " (yeah)
"Swear please. " (yupp)
"... Move over let me in, I'll drive. Homies I'll be right back. "
(closes car door)
Sigh "So why me? "

"Because your his twin brother, and you know all his tricks"

"Yeah so we twins, but you know we so damn opposite
plus I ain't seen that conceited negro in three years... "

"But u still look just like him, sound just like him, look
I just want to know who this bitch is. "

"So holla at me tell me what you want me to do? "

"Shave, call this number, and go over there in a suit. "

"Look you sure? " (yes I'm sure)
"You correct? " (I'm correct)
"Look girl u better be right... "
(I am, I put it on my life because

I checked, his phone
(I checked) the calls (all the calls)
(I checked) the home (our home)
(I checked) the cars (and the cars)

He's a lier, broke the code and read the text
