PREGNANT

Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Knock you up, pregnant, Knock you up, pregnant

Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man,
And take her to her hotel for just a one night stand,
See I’m a playa so I ain’t tryna take her on no dates,
But much like my patrone man I’m just tryna take it straight,
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty,
Sweetest girl in the world to me and I mean it and on top of that shes a cutie,
I ain’t seen nothing like her around here in a while,
And if I had a girl she’d be the one to bear my child,
Telling myself I’m a playa so I keep tryna shake it off,
But I keep seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog,
Never felt nothing like this,
Shes more than a mistress enough bout to handle my business,
Now put that girl in my kitchen,

Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
That’s what I told her,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Knock you up, pregnant, Knock you up, pregnant

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me,
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese,
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasy,
I can have you co-starring and get in one of my new movies,
Tell me what your name is,
I can make you famous,
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexing,
Now I ain’t got nothing to do tonight I gotta wait for my crew,
I just wanna put some on you,
And I can tell that you want it too,
Reeaaaddyy, Reeaaaddyy

So come on ladies let´s get out of this club,
Kells, Dream and ´Rese after party,

Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,

This song has got me hungry baby baby
So tell me that you want me baby baby
And girl I´ll love you till the sun shines (shines)
And girl I promise i will make you mine (loving)
Around the world in and out of clubs hanging with chicks
