BUMP 'N GRIND

My minds telling me no
But my body my body's telling me
Yeah baby I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you

(chorus)
I don't see nothing wrong (wrong)
With a little bump and grind
With a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong (wrong ba ba baby hey)
I don't see nothing wrong (wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
With a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong (wrong)

(lookie here)
See I know just what you want
And I know just what you need girl
So baby bring your body to me
(bring your body here)
I'm not fooling around with you baby

With you with you is where I want to be I want to be girl
You need someone someone like me
To satisfy your every need

(chorus)
