WANNA BE THERE (FEAT. ARIIRAYÉ)

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Things that I have to say to you
You need to hear
And I know we've got some rebuildin', oh
But I believe time will heal

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Anything that you wanna do
Baby girl I'mma support you
And anything that you're going through
I swear, I will be there for you, you
It's been so many years so I know it feels awkward
Know you had to tuck all your tears in your school locker
And I understand your position
And why your heart went missin'
And things that you wondered

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Oh oh-ooh
I know that you mad at me, thinkin' that I didn't care
Talk to me, cause

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I just wanna be there
When you conquer the world
I just wanna be there
But no matter how successful baby girl
When you need someone to lean on, I just wanna be your shoulder
When you need someone to call on, I wanna be the one to hold ya
I just wanna be there
(Be there, Be there, Be there)
I just wanna be there

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Call me back when I be calling you
Cause I be feelin' like I'm stalking you
And I know you've got issues with rejection, oh
I'm just being honest, I know what you're thinking, never did I neglect ya, no
Cause I love you too much Jo
And I would just kill myself before I do anything to hurt ya
One hunnid, all I ever wanted to do is please you
And I don't know what happened to us but I need you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I just wanna be there
When you conquer the world I just wanna be there
But no matter how successful baby girl
When you need someone to lean on, I just wanna be your shoulder
When you need someone to call on, I wanna be the one to hold ya
I just wanna be there
(Be there, Be there, Be there)
I just wanna be there

[Verse 3: Ariirayé]
I know that there were so many things going on
And there were some times I thought I wouldn't make it
But my brothers and me kept each other strong
How do I tell 'em why you're not there
When I don't even know myself
I hate you, I love you, I do and I don't wanna see you
You tell us you need us but that we just need to believe you
My heart is broke, it's so hard to cope
And every night I cry out to heaven cause I need you both more
And sometimes it was easy to not say anything
My mind was at war, "Baby, you're not the enemy"
And it still feels like we're miles away
But I can meet you halfway cause at the end of the day

[Chorus: R. Kelly, (Ariirayé) & Duet]
I just wanna be there
Be there for you, yeah, yeah
When you conquer the world I just wanna be there
But no matter how successful baby girl
When you need someone to lean on, I just wanna be your shoulder
When you need someone to call on, I wanna be the one to hold ya
I just wanna be there
(Be there, Be there, Be there)
I just wanna be there
