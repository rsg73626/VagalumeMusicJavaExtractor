SHARE MY LOVE

Come here, baby
Just lay your body right here, baby
And let me tell you all
Of the things I wanna do to you, baby

Oh, girl, relax
Oh, baby
Cause I'm about to prove to you
That every bit of me wants to be lying here with you
All I wanna I do

I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
Share my love,
Share my love with you
Oh, baby

I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
All of my,
Share my love,
I just want,
Share my love with you

Let go, baby
And let this feeling get in you
Why don't you
Just come a little closer girl
Let me show you what my love can do

Oh, take that off
Oh, girl, and let the fun begin
If you just,
Just throw that out to love tonight
I promise it'll never hurt again, oh, no

I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
For the rest of my life, baby
I wanna share my love
I just wanna
Share my love
Share my love, share my love with you
Oh, baby

Now that we're in this room,
Let's do what we were born to do
Populate, let's get together
Populate, make the world better
Populate

I just wanna share my love with you, baby
I just wanna share my love, it's all I wanna do
I wanna share my love,
Share my love,
Share my love with you

I just wanna share my love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna share my love
Girl, come over here and get this love
I wanna share my love
It's all for you
Share my love,
Share my love with you

I just wanna share my love
Love
I just wanna share my love
Forever, baby

Share my love,
Share my love,
Share my love with you
