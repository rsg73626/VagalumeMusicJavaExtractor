HOTEL

Ladies and gentlemen, you are listening to the sounds of swiss beats. 
We got cassidy in here. Kels! We in our throwbacks. 
This is for the ladies, we got room keys. 

[Chorus (R.Kelly):] 
Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key. 
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl. 
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie. 
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me. 
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin' 

[Cassidy:] 
I'm staying in the hotel, not the motel or the holiday in. 
If that girl don't participate, well then I'ma take her friend. 
Well if, mami is with it then, mami can give it then, mami a rider, I'ma, slide up beside her. 
I got a suite, you can creep on through, I know you tryin' to get your freak on too, 
I'll do it all for that, yeah I ball for that, hit the mall for that, 
keep it fly for them, keep my eye on them, hot tub for them, pop bub' for them, I got love for ma, yeeah! 

[Chorus (R.Kelly):] 
Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key. 
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl. 
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie. 
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me. 
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin' 

[Cassidy:] 
We're the new Car-tel, R.Kel with the kid Cassidy. 
Girl if you man start actin' up, ask for him or ask for me. 
'Cuz see, we could go get it crackin, but you know what'll happen, 
we be under the covers, makin' love to each other. 
I got a double bed, one's to sleep on, other one's to get my freak on, it's all for them. 
Yeah I ball for that, hit the mall for that, keep 
it fly for them, keep my eye on them, hot tub for them, pop bub' for them, I got love for ma, yeeeah! 

[Chorus (R Kelly)] 
Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key. 
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl. 
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie. 
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me. 
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin' 

[Cassidy:] 
We goin' Chi-town steppin' out, to the club lettin' out, and we goin' sex it out, 
'til we all checkin' out. I got my chicks 
I'ma bring to the tele, we 'bout to do the damn thing, sing to 'em Kelly. 

[R.Kelly:] 
It's alright(it's alright) If you wanna come with me, and fulfill your fantasy, baby in my hotel suite. 
And it's ok, if you wanna party night 'til day, I will do anything you say. 
Just come to my hotel. 

[Chorus (R.Kelly):] 
Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key. 
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl. 
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie. 
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me. 
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
