HOLD ON

Wars, was; tumbles and falls,
time, change, clouds and rain,
Through it all I will stand, come with me (Mmm)
Through anytime, not today
Cause where theres a will theres a way.
Oooh I'm gonna hold,
hold on, hold on, hold on,
I'm gonna hold,
hold on, hold on, hold on, yes I will
until the finish I'll be strong.

Oceans, strong winds, hills and mountains, sacrifice,
payin the price, share, struggle all your life,
through it all, I will stand,
come with me (yes I will)
Through anytime, no not today,
Cause where theres a will theres a way, (whoa-ooo)
Im gonna hold,
hold on, hold on, hold on,
I'm gonna hold,
hold on, hold on, hold on,
until the finish, I'll be strong.

Ooh, I will be, tomorrow will surely come,
And I'm gonna be the first to see the sun,
Through anytime, not today,
Cause I know that,
where theres a will theres a way-(oooh)
Im gonna hold,
hold on, hold on, hold on,
Yes I am, Im gonna hold,
hold on, hold on, hold on,
Yes I am, Im gonna hold on,

On the highway, in the bi-way,
If I just hold on, (hold on)
Im gonna make it there someday (hold on)
Through the storm (hold on), and through the rain (hold on),
You can knock me down, but Im gonna stand again
Yes I will,
Running on this track, hey, if I keep my pace,
hey, I can see the finish line,
Im gonna win this race, hey,
Hold on, Hold on.
