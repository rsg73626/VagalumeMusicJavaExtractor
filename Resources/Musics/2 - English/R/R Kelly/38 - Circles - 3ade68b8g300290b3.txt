CIRCLES

[Verse 1]
Baby, I got an idea
And I hope you're open
to the things that I wanna do to ya, baby
I wanna pay a visit to the private places on you, baby
And I know you're gonna like what I do, oh, oh
Make your body moan
Kissing all on that spot until your mind is gone
And there ain't nothing that can shut you up now
Especially when I'm doing circles
For now I'm teasing you, but in a minute I'm pleasing you

[Hook]
I'll be doing it with my face down
I'm gonna kiss it with my face down
Girl, you love to see my face down
Got you screaming and moaning while my face down
Call my name while my face down
Rub my head while my face down
I'm not coming up till you've had enough
I'll be keepin' my face down
Doing circles
I'll be doing circles

[Verse 2]
Now imagine my face missing, baby, for hours
(OOhh and still it ain't over)
See, I'll be doing this 'til the morning comes
Cause shorty you need a man like me
That can keep your body trembling
likes it's supposed to be
And there ain't nothing that can shut you up now
Especially when I'm doing circles
For now I'm teasing yo, u but in a minute
I'm pleasing you

[Hook]
I'll be doing it with my face down
I'm gonna kiss it with my face down
Girl, you love to see my face down
Got you screaming and moaning while my face down
Call my name while my face down
Rub my head while my face down
I'm not coming up till you've had enough
I'll be keepin' my face down
Doing circles
I'll be doing circles

[Bridge]
Girl in the middle
(Girl in the middle of the night)
When it feels like the worlds asleep
You wake up to me on my knees trying to get in between
And it feels so good you wanna scratch something
Feels so good you wanna bite something
And I just what you to know that I can take it so bite me
Oh, I'mma make your legs shake
Then after I'm done we gon' make the bed break

[Hook]
I'll be doing it with my face down
I'm gonna kiss it with my face down
Girl, you love to see my face down
Got you screaming and moaning while my face down
Call my name while my face down
Rub my head while my face down
I'm not coming up till you've had enough
I'll be keepin' my face down
Doing circles
I'll be doing circles
