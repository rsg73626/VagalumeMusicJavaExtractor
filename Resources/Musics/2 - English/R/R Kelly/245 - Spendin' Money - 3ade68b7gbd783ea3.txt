SPENDIN' MONEY

Chorus:
All that money I spend all those places I been I
can´t forget you baby
Here´s life without you
Working hard for this loot wanna spend it with you
I want you with me baby
Here´s life without you

Baby,through all the ups and downs you were a
lady
I wanna show you how I love you
Baby,deserve the very best and I´ll give to you
only to you
How can I show you that only you satisfy everything
that you do
Baby girl anything that you want I´ll give to you just
promise me forever, boo

Baby I can´t imagine life without you with me
I never want to be without you
Baby I want you to believe it´s true all that I do I do

everything that you do
Anything that you want I´ll give to you just promise
me forever, boo

Chorus

Don´t know why you stayed by my side for so long
So I dedicate,baby in every way all my heart and
soul it belongs to you
