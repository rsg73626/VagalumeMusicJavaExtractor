I'M SENDING YOU MY LOVE FOR CHRISTMAS

I never really believed in a Santa
And thought that all the fairytales were fake
And all these stories about love
And the moon and stars above
I would tell all of my friends it's just a phase
A silly phase
I used to think that joy was just a rumor
And happiness was all too much the same
Since the day that I found you
All of these things became true
Now dreams and all these things I can do
Merry Christmas, baby

Sorry I could not be there with you
But I pray everything is ok
I want you to know that I am missing you
And my heart is with you even though I'm far away
So tell me how's the dog, house, family and friends?
I want you to let em all know that I wish 'em well
And I promise I'll be coming home real soon
While I'm gone just keep checkin' your mail

Cause I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you that strength when times get tough
And just be on the look out for my trust
Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas

Out of the window the snow is coming down
And it all that makes me miss you more and more, more
So many memories of us all around the tree
And Grandpa would bring the presents through the door
And you and I, we done fool the kids to fall asleep
So that we can grab us drinks and toast to what we have
Though reading this letter is tough
Just know I really miss you much
So think of me when you're putting the lights up
Cause baby

I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you that strength when times get tough
And just be on the look out for my trust
Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas

And every word that I wrote
Is a word closer to home
So I just want you to hold on
Cause it won't be long
For as long as I live
Your heart will be my greatest gift
This is your Christmas Letter
Baby, from your Santa
Be on the look out

I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you that strength when times get tough
And just be on the look out for my trust
Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas
