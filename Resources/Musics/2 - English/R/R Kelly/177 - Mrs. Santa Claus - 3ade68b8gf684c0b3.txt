MRS. SANTA CLAUS

Mrs. Santa Claus
There will be no work for me tonight
(There will be no work)
'Cause I'm gonna spend this time to get into you
Mrs. Santa Claus
This year will be the year
I make holiday love to you for Christmas
And you won't regret it, you won't forget it
Baby, just let me
OO girl, just let me unwrap you
See, your body will be my gift tonight, Mrs. Santa
And I promise that we'll deck all the halls
With shadows of you and me on the walls

Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Santa Claus
There will be no work for me tonight, no baby
Except for you and me, baby, making love, making love

Everything that we do on this night
I will make sure, baby, that I make you feel alright
Decorate your body with my body, baby
Tonight is a private Christmas Party
Gonna lay you down and fill your stockings up
Oh baby, my darling
Seasons greetings
So glad to be taking off of work for you
And there's no kids, no family tonight
It's just you and me, baby
And I just wanna give you all this love
Darlin', baby, come open your gift
Come on and open your gift

Please, Mrs. Santa
Mrs., Mrs. Santa, Mrs. Santa, Mrs. Santa
Would you be my gift tonight?
I just wanna unwrap you baby
Mrs. Santa, oh
There will be no work for me tonight, girl
Mrs. Santa
Oh, Merry Christmas
