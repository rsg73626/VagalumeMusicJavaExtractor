LOVELAND

Iâ€™ma bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me x5

Ooh itâ€™s unbelievable
How your body feels next to mine
Ooh itâ€™s uncontrollable
How you put it down every time
Girl you know that you got me
Going up and down
Fulfilling my greatest fantasy
Stroking it round and round
I donâ€™t know what else to do but love you suga
So come on letâ€™s cuddle up and make sweet love

You donâ€™t need a ticket just get onboard
Iâ€™ma bout to take you into Loveland

Chorus
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around
Repeat

Ooh we donâ€™t know
What tomorrow will bring
So we gonna make this last forever
Iâ€™ma bout to taste your love till you canâ€™t take it anymore sweetheart
Imagine that said I guarantee to make your body come to me
Hey baby Iâ€™m gon set your soul free
Girl Iâ€™m bout to take you into Loveland

Chorus

It takes love for the world to go round and round
Even though it has its ups and down
Joy is the key to my soul
Anyone unlock me
Ooh Lord have mercy

Chorus
