LET'S BE REAL NOW (FEAT. TINASHE)

[Intro: R. Kelly]
I don't know if I'ma be able to give you what you want

[Verse 1 R. Kelly]
No disrespect to the things that you want girl
but you fuckin' crazy
Got me working this overtime shift lovin' you
but you don't even pay me
And now you wanna blame me
Say it's my fault for your heartache and pain, shit
You created this storm, so don't try to run
baby here come the rain
Tell me how can I trust you
when you're still in contact with all of these guys
Do you really think I'ma come home
and lay in your bed full of lies

[Pre-Chorus 1: R. Kelly]
You're just an actress, and this love is a scene
But you expect me to show up with a ring
Come on

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
What do I look like to you, seriously?
Come on, let's be real

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
No disrespect to the time that we spent
but boy you must be trippin'
You expect me to post up at home for you
but now the tables are flippin'
And now you wanna blame me
cause everyone else realized what they was missin'
I bet you feel dumb now, bet you feel so dumb right now
It's hardly a secret, you fucked with my head
Had me believe it was all because I did it for love
And that was enough
When really you put in no effort instead

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tinashe]
You're just an actor and this love is a scene
Damn I just wish you would say what you mean
Come on

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Tinashe]
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
Come on now let's be real
(Let's be real)

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
There ain't nothin' that I won't do
From jumping off buildings, moving the mountains
Swim the sea for you
Whatever you want babe, I'll do it
You just let me beg, I'll do it
Anything you ask, I'll do it
See that smiling face
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you
Ride or die, I'd take one for you
Any and everything except your fool

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Tinashe]
Let's be real now
(Girl let's be real)
Let's be real now
(Baby come on)
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
(What do I look like, let's be real)
Come on, let's be real
(Now let's just keep it 100 baby)
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
