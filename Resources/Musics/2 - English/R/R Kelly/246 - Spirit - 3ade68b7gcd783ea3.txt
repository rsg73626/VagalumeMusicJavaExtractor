SPIRIT

I can see my destination
I can hear my call
No more hesitation,mmm
This time I'm goin' for it all



'Cause I know where this road leads to
And therefore I will rise
I know this dream will come true, uh
And I will soar the sky


(Spirit,spirit)
Would you guide me, oh
(Spirit) Oh (Spirit)
Stand by me
Come on, Come on, Come on
set me free



I can feel the penetration
Of a strong wind movin' me, mmm
I feel can the elevation,mmm
of an angel lifting me,mmm



'Cause I know where this road leads to
Therefore I will rise
I know this dream will come true,oh
And I will soar the sky



(chorus)



(Oh,Spirit)



Now that I've found my way home
I've got to get there,get there
Though one step seems one mile long
Your bridge before my face
I will take the leap of faith 



(chorus,Until fade)
