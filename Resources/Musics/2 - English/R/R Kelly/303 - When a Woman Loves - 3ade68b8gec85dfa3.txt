WHEN A WOMAN LOVES

When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
She took me back

After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted, I'm forever indebted,
I'm forever indebted to her cause

When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did

And she's got more, more faith in me 
Than a beach got sand
And I like to tell ha, I like to tell ha, 
That I'm forever indebted,that I'm forever indebted, 
Forever indebted
Cause when a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
Yea, yea
See a woman loves
It would never die young
Even when I'm dead and gone, 
I'm gonna love her from the sky
Cause she's given me something 
That no other woman has given me 

(Whooooo)
When I think about you girl it makes me think
When, when, when, when a woman
When a Woman Loves
She loves for real (oh)
When a woman loves, loves, loves
I'm tellin you when she loves

She, she loves for real
Yea, yea, yea
When she loves (When she loves) (6X)
She (When she loves) (3x)
She loves for real
