I KNOW U GOT A MAN (I DON'T CARE)

Man I walk up in the club 
And there she is 
Sittin' with her man 
And lookin' at me 
So I walk to the bar 
And buy me a drink 
And I look over my shoulder and she still lookin' at
me 

So I walked to the club 
Actin' like I don't see her 
You know - keeping cool and shit 
When I really wanna meet her 
And she bite her lips like she ? 
Just posted up (like a patient?) 
Waiting for her man to go to the bathroom 
Then we catch a break, because dude steps away 
That's all I need for me to make my move 

CHORUS (GR) 

SAID I KNOW YOU GOTTA A MAN BUT (I DON'T CARE) 
CAUSE YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT ME GIRL LIKE (I DON'T CARE) 
AND JUST ALL WE DON'T BE MAD GOTTA STAY TWO STEPS
AHEAD 
TAKE MY NUMBER CALL ME TEXT ME WHEREVER (I DON'T CARE)


Now here he comes on his way back from the bathroom 
Shhhh, we gotta keep this between me and you 
Now - I'm gonna walk away, he's movin' kinda fast 
And if he acts about me baby; I'm a friend from your
past 
You and I'll be sexin' undercover?? 
See I just wanna be your secret lover 
So chill with him tonight baby girl I'm leavin' 
You just hit me up and we'll be off until next weekend

Belive me, believe me, I wanna hit that, 
Believe me, believe me, baby real rap 


CHORUS (GR) 

Now some say it's a shame, but I"m playin' the game 
Even dude is a lame, or shorty know my name - off 
And it's very easy to see, shorty gonna be with me 
So while he's buyin' the drinks, I'll be ? 


CHORUS (GR) 

I'm lookin' at her, she lookin' back 
She with her man, forget that 
I gotta have her; like my money stack 
I got her 'round, like my Cadillac 
? 
Download my music, I download you girl 

CHORUS (GR) (TILL THE END)
