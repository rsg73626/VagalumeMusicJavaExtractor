TIP THE WAITER

Uh, tip the waiter, girl, tip the waiter, uh
(I been waiting all night for the club to end now it's time to jump on it)

At 12 o'clock I entered the club, bout 12:15 I'm lookin at her
They said like it's her birthday, like shes on a vaca
And I'm jus gonna hang out right here til it's clear
Visions of her working a pole, the combination of that ass and patron
Makes a nigga wanna make it rain like a ticker-tape parade
I can't wait til I get you home

Up in the champagne room I got you moanin all because you windin on a really hard somethin...
(This foreplay) I'm a winner (Is gonna be) Like dinner, yes
Patience is a virtue and girl I feel so glad that I...

Waited all night for you to finish that dance
Tipsy off that liquor and it's makin me ask
"Would you tip the waiter? you, t-tip the waiter? you, tip the waiter? t-tip the waiter? "
Girl I want some gratuity, I don't mean cash
Lookin at your body it's makin me wanna ask
"Would you tip the waiter? you, tip the waiter? t-t-tip the waiter? tip the waiter? "

Now it's like a quarter to 2 and I'm still tryina go home with you
But you got your girls around you, y'all sippin on that hundred proof
And I'm just gon lay back and be cool til you're through
Dance has got your dress goin up and you're at the bar refillin your cup
And I'm waitin up in this club hopin you gon show some love
It's 3 o'clock, you're still on the floor

Up in the champagne room I got you moanin all because you grindin on a really hard somethin...
(This foreplay) I'm a winner (Is gonna be) Like dinner, yes
Patience is a virtue and girl I feel so glad that I...

Wanna make you mine, so girl I'm gonna wait for ya
Like I'm on the front line, a soldier's gonna wait for ya
Til I see the whites in your eyes, I'll be here
I been waitin all of this time so I'll be here
(it's 5:00) I feel so good they're sayin last call,
(it's 5:30) and I'm hopin you're not ready to go home
(6:00) I steps to her (6:30) says I'm the R,
(In the parking lot) headed in my car, and I'm so glad that I...
