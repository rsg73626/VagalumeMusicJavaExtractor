RELIGIOUS LOVE

Spoken: Here I sit waiting on you baby
    Please. come back to me 

           Dearly beloved why did you go 
       When being with you forever is all I hoped
          Slowly the rain is falling in our home
        Come back and start right from going wrong 
          I'll be still until i hear from you
    And i'll be waiting until you return this message

         A religious love for you baby
              Every night I pray
     That heaven will send you back to me
        Baby you're all I ever needed 
         A religious love for ya baby
             Every night I pray
    That someday I'll have you for my wife
      Baby you are my life, please belive me

      For only God knows how much I miss you 
       And for us to be as one it takes two
     So don't you go dying on me not right now
      Please change this impossible to somehow
     I'll be praying until you return this message

                    Chorus
     In the middle of the night, I'll be calling on you 
     Every single breath I take I hope to see you there
     If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend 
      Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me

        Oh baby come to me-don't you leave me lonely
       I need you here with me so return this message
      
                    Chorus
