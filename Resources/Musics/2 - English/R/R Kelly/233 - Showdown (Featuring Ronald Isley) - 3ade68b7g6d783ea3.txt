SHOWDOWN (FEATURING RONALD ISLEY)

I feel that the time is here
For you to bring your body here
And give me what Iâ€™ve waited for
Hurry up and come on in and close the door
Iâ€™m about to get up on it
Feed me girl cause Iâ€™m so hungry
Got plenty money but Iâ€™m still lonely
Gotta have you now cause me so horny
Black and Asian girl 
Tattoo on your tummy
Thugged out as Hell
But Iâ€™mma make you love me
Sip some aphrodisiac and baby girl itâ€™s on
I promise you I will do all the words to this song


Showdown
Iâ€™m about to lay your body down
Rodeo be like up and down
Bout to show you how I throw down
Itâ€™s about to be a showdown
Iâ€™m about to lay your body down
My rodeo be like up and down
Bout to show you how I throw down
Baby itâ€™s about to be a

Anything that you want me to do

Off in the club girl you dance so freaky (Aisha, where are you)
Tongue diamond pierced with a look thatâ€™s kinky
Acting like you want me to turn you out
Attitude like what, Kelly take me now
Black and Asian girl 
Tattoo on your tummy
Doped out and scared
But Iâ€™mma make you love me
Sip some aphrodisiac and baby girl itâ€™s on
I promise I will do all the words to this song

Now give me the mike so I can get buck wild
Like â€œFiesta, Fiestaâ€ still moving the crowd
Out of all the girls Iâ€™ve loved before
Got plenty of honeys ------
Puff puff give now let me hit it once more
Fake ass niggas get out and close my door
Itâ€™s my house for me to live not yours
If I wanted to I could ---- on the floors
Through the doors like a western flick, the club is crunked
Henney and Chris you know that boyâ€™s tore up
About 8 or 9 black stallions riding up
Itâ€™s Mr. Biggs screaming showdown
Iâ€™m like What?


(Mr. Biggs)
Now Kelly
Itâ€™s not enough room in this town
For you and me so letâ€™s get down
Iâ€™m sick and tired of you and this down low fight
From Contagious all the way to Mrs. Price
You done it now with Ms. Black Aisha
I knew something was funny when she stopped paging
House, cars, shopping malls
Man I tell you itâ€™s a battle call
Like a raging bull Iâ€™m about to charge you
Kelly you wonâ€™t see tomorrow
Itâ€™s time to put an end to your late night creeps
Now any last words before my pistol speaks



Mr. Biggs, now no disrespect but man Iâ€™m tired
Cause all these years itâ€™s my back you been riding
We been in and out of fights on these videos
Now itâ€™s about time you felt the real rodeo
See I dated Lila 98 of September 
You took her from me, yeah right you donâ€™t remember
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera
How clever you were when you slipped her your number
Ooh, I know that makes yâ€™all wanna know
Ooh, whoâ€™s really on the down low
You wonder why weâ€™re always at it, there it is
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs cause Iâ€™m about to get
Wild Wild West sick and tired of your mess
You put me to the test and now Iâ€™m sticking out my chest
So any last words before I draw these cannons
Cause when the smoke clears Iâ€™ll be the last man standing at the


Showdown
Iâ€™m about to lay your body down
Rodeo be like up and down
Bout to show you how I throw down
Itâ€™s about to be a showdown
Iâ€™m about to lay your body down
Rodeo be like up and down
Bout to show you how I throw down
Baby itâ€™s about to be a
