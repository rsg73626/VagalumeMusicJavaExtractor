FEELIN' ON YO BOOTY

(Chorus) this is my song, fa real, no doubt
said tha dj's makin me feel thugged out
as i walked you to tha dance floor
baby getcha dance on
put your arms around me
im feelin on your booty

hey pretty mama how ya doin
said im just in town for the weekend
lookin for a lil trouble 2 get into
baby tell me what u drinkin and i got u

playas wanna play
ballas wanna ball
rollas wanna roll
(but im takin all)

Chorus x2

now your body's got me feelin like spendin
with a back room i could come to live in
and your hair weaves lookin kinda perty
the way you back it up on me baby,
God have mercy

Playas wanna play
Ballas wanna ball (Ballas wanna ball)
Rollas wanna roll
(but im takin all after i dance)

Chorus x2

If its your birthday, then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk, then put your hands up
And if you got some cash, then put your hands up
And your own job, put your hands up
(playas wanna play)

Playas wanna play
Ballas wanna ball (Ballas wanna ball)
Rollas wanna roll
(feel so good, say it again)

Playas wanna play
Ballas wanna ball (Ballas wanna ball)
Rollas wanna roll
(but im takin all after i dance)

Chorus x5 and fade
