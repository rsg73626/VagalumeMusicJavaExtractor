BEEN AROUND THE WORLD

Chorus
I've been around the world
And gets nothin but love
For who I am 
I thank my fans so much 
And even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

R.Kelly
I've been around the world and back like what up
East side to west side tourin like what up
And even though the price for the house was so much
I sill rode with them from the hood like what up
Cause when it comes to bein the realest I'm sho nuff
Ima straight up industry villian fo sho nuff
And I can't satitsfy some of yall no matter what 
And some ya'll cats are so jealous
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Where there ain't nuthin but 
Fake faces, fake people, fake friends
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Where there ain't nuthin but
Envy, wannabees, playa hatas
Yeah, I know I need a hug but yall need a hug too
Cause God gon judge me the same day he judge you
And even though we have are struggles that's alright
You know we ghetto folks is gon find a way to shine

Chorus

Ja Rule
Sometimes this world can be so cold
When you lookin through the windows of the soul
Iv'e been lookin to see the truth as it unfolds
Cause Iv'e been around this globe enough and back to know the fact
Who loves me
And who loves me not
We be shit so hot
You could put it in red tops
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block
Until they heart stops
Thats why they fiend for me
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me Lord
And im grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords 
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off
Rubbin they face in fame
Im sorry I changed the game
But its mine and I cant complain
Rule and R Kelly
Been around the world
Puttin it on women
Bumpin n grindin these bitches
But we always on time when a woman fed up
And thats love
Thats why they all fuck wit us

Chorus

R Kelly
Said my lyrics is my testimony
That's how live
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies
Over the years
You see me on the TV sometimes
Not how it is 
Yall gotta start learnin how to separte me from show biz 
When im rollin through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me hug
And no im not conceited (right)
Its just my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever
Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we can make it better

Chorus
