SWEET TOOTH

This is for them big girls, smalls girls, tall girls
And this is for them skinny girls, white girls, black
girls
Don't matter the color, any nationality
I got a sweet tooth come and get with me

When I saw you at the club girl leanin and rockin wit
it
Ooh you made a nigga wanna get with it
Let me put you in the back of the coupe and hit it
And now all I wanna do is babysit it
I been feenin, wantin to kiss it
Hungry girl let me raid your kitchen
Fix me a plate of that
I'm not playing girl I'm on a mission

Legs won't stop shaking once i do it (uh uhn)
Tongue game tight girl let me do it (uh huh)
Tease you then please you girl
Open up let me in your world

Girl I wanna be alone with you
I'm trying to see what that booty do
Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this
sweet tooth

Chorus:
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big ol' piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Ooh it taste like skittles

I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl I got a sweet tooth

Now that I got you on my bed
Clothes off
Lying next to me
Girl I'm about to give myself a cavity
Plus I'm gonna need band-aids for my knees
Girl set the table
Now let me feast
Strawberry shortcake
With whipped cream
I can taste it
My mouth is watering for you
Come here girl let me show you



Hop in the rain
Slide through
All up in your crib
And toss you
When it's over
I want more of you
So open up let me explore you

Girl I wanna be alone with you
I'm trying to see what that booty do
Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this
sweet tooth

Chorus:
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big ol' piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Ooh it taste like skittles

I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl I got a sweet tooth

Bridge:
I don't want no dinner babe
I'm going straight for dessert
You don't need no panties babe
Girl up under that t-shirt

Well you taste so good to me
And, I can't get enough
See, doc say stay away from sweets, fuck it
Come on and get my sugar up

Chorus: (repeat until the end)
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big ol' piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Ooh it taste like skittles

I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl I got a sweet tooth
(repeat until the end)
