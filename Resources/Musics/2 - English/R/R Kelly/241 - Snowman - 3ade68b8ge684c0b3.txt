SNOWMAN

From the opposite side of the window pane
I see family and friends
All alone in the cold, freezing rain
Is how I feel within

I'm comin' on somebody
Wish I had somebody
To bring me peace, love and shelter
She's gotta be someone
Who really needs someone
And this he really needs a her

I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
Someone who can share my snow world
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

As the snow is slowly falling down
My thoughts are burning within (Oh, how I need)
Oh how I need a snow angel around
A faithful lover and friend

Oh, comin' on somebody
Wish I had somebody
To bring me peace, love and shelter
She's gotta be someone
Who really needs someone
And this he really needs a her

I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
Someone who can share my snow world
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

Someone tell Santa Claus
That I'm out here in this cold, yeah
And I need a present that can keep me warm, warm

I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
Someone who to share my snow world
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
(I really, really need somebody to share my snow world
To keep each other warm at night, so give me your love)
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
(Really need you, Christmas, really need you
Really, really, really need you)
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
