IGNITION

You remind me of something...
I just can't think of what it is...

Girl...please...
Let me stick my key in your ignition babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin' babe
See I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl I won't stop until I drive you crazy
So buckle up cause this can get bumpy babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions babe
Girl back that thang up so I can wax it babe
Honey we gon' mess around and get a ticket babe

Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all off in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and downin'
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Justa thugin' it out

Jump up, down once I hit them switches babe
And I'm about to take it where you wanna go babe
Guarantee I'm 'bout to get some mileage babe
And it won't be no runnin' out of gas babe
It's like wooo oooh pull over babe
And let me put this lovin' off in your trunk babe
So buckle up cause this can get bumpy babe
Girl we gon' mess around and get a ticket babe

Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all off in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and downin'
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Justa thugin' it out



Now hold on tight cause I'm about to go faster babe
Girl your dealin' with a pro behind this wheel babe
So tell me have you ever driven a stick babe
You be screamin' every time we shift them gears babe
So brace yourself while I'm hittin' them corners babe
And when it's over put that Kell on your license plate
Now buckle up cause this can get bumpy babe
Girl we gon' mess around and get a ticket babe

Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all off in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and downin'
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Justa thugin'it out

When I hear you say - Green light
I'ma go - Yellow light
Do it slow - Red light
I'ma stop
When I hear you say - Switch lanes
Hit the signal - Pit stop
Take a break
Hit the hazards when we park
When you say - Green light
I'ma go - Yellow light
Do it slow - Red light
I'ma stop
When you say - Switch lanes
Hit my signal - Pit stop
Take a break
Because we're 'bout to go real far

Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all off in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and downin'
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Justa thugin'it out

Now let me see you
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Now let me see you
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
