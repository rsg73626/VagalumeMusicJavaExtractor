EVERY POSITION

Girl, you so turned up
hitting them tricks on the pole
can you work it like that if I take you home?
I wanna do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
in every position
I wanna do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
in every position

see I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
I ain't got no favorite one
in every position

seen a lot of girls, where you been hiding?
you something special, cut like a diamond
when you do it like that, other chicks forget it
all that ass, all this cash, baby, you about to get it
have dinner on the jet, you ain't seen nothing yet

think I'm good with this flirting shit, wait till we get to sex
and woah, gonna turn you to a singer
get you in my bed, have you hitting them notes like aretha
and woah, if you don't know I'mma teach ya
first semester in my bedroom, now I'm about to freak ya

the way you do it on the pole, girl, you straight wilding
out of all the other chicks, it's your number that I'm dialing
when I get you to myself I'mma show you what you're missing
excuse my french when I go low, baby, that's just how I kiss it
so put your legs around my neck, get it aquafina wet
I back up what I'm talking, baby ain't no need to flex

and woah, 'mma be your addiction
doctor kama sutra, filling your prescription
and woah, girl, I'm on a mission
we ain't leaving this room till we hit every position
and woah, shorty, say it like you mean it
you been looking for that work, baby girl, about to bring it
