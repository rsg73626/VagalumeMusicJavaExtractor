HALF ON A BABY

*Bridge 1*
Ooh, na na na ( yo... yo body) yo' body, na na na (2x)

*verse 1*
turn the lights down low, I'm ready da break it off
Since computer love, been wantin to set it off
like a hotel room I'm checkin in to u
Diggin like shovel, all the things you do
take a leap over da broom, it's how u makin me feel
Come on in dis room, and let's keep it real, you know

*chorus*
Half on mah baby
All I need is your body next to me (saying ooh)
ooh na na na na na (yo.. yo body) Yo body na na na *2x*

*verse 2*
Now tell me what da deal is, are u ready to bump
It's gonna take a life time, to give u all of dis love
so baby open up, and get ready to recieve
a miracle of love, gettin down wid me
like a baseball field, wanna hit a home run
me and u get together babe, and raise a lil one

*chorus*2x

*verse 3*
set it off in a six, baby dat'll be cool
take a trip down town between me and you
Sippin DonPerigdon
Conversation like, wha?
Not afraid to go there, why don't u open up
after 9 to 5, you deserve some 12
makin future plans, to be where I dwell

*chorus* 2x

*Bridge 2*
>From my toes up (From my toes up)
to my knee cap (to my knee caps, to waistline)
and slowly (and slowly, lady)
can we go half on mah baby *2x*

*chorus*
