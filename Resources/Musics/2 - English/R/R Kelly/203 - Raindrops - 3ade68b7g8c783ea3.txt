RAINDROPS

Baby, is it all right if I break it down and give you something romantic?
I figured since it's raining, this would be the perfect time for usâ€¦.

Can you hear the sounds of the, love angels calling us
Sweet violins and harps playing, then suddenly there's this kiss of trust

Hook:
Dapper then the morning dew, tonight has chosen me and you
And girl I vow to make everyone of your fantasies come true
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing, a full orchestra and a choir singing
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing, it feels so good, keep on going

Chorus:
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us

Can you see the flowers blooming, slowly as the seasons change
The gift of joy is founded when I softly hear you call my name
Rose petals, and all these oils, surrounded by 100 candles
An eagle delivers a letter that says the night will last forever

Hook:
Dapper then the morning dew, tonight has chosen me and you
And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come true
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing, a full orchestra and a choir singing
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing, don't you stop, keep on going

Chorus:
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us

Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows then suddenly a rainbowâ€¦
And an ocean filled with white sailboats and huge waterfalls that overflow
See those in well are fairytales, I will buck for love
And imagine far away from here in a land where the sky cries joyful tears 

Baby another wordsâ€¦.Will you marry me?
