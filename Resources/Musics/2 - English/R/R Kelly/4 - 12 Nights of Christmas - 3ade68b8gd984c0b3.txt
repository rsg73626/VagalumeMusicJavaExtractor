12 NIGHTS OF CHRISTMAS

Come inside, the world is cold
I'll cuddle you and love you slow
Open arms waiting for you
Girl, just call and I'm there for you
Oh, what I've got planned tonight
You and I scheduled to fly
So let love take us right off from this room

You look like you could use a friend
Refuse to let loneliness win
No way
Girl, it's Christmas for Christ's sake

Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Tell me, baby, now
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?

We'll take a trip around the world
I'd make one wish and you'd be my girl
I believe in Christmas magic, baby, yeah
Look into each other's eyes
Discover Christmas paradise
Just let me take your body away tonight

You look like you could use a friend
Refuse to let loneliness win
No way
It's Christmas for Christ's sake

Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Tell me, girl
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Girl

Tonight I'm gonna put the world under your Christmas Tree, girl
And the greatest gift of all, girl, is you here lying next to me, girl
Would you baby? (Repeat

Tell me would you like

Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Baby, tell me, would you like, girl
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Just come go with me, girl
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
I can take you there, baby
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
If you wanna go, just reach out to me, baby
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
Would you like to spend
12 Nights of Christmas with me?
