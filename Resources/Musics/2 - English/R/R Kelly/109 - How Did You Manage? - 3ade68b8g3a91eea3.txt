HOW DID YOU MANAGE?

Oooh mmm, oooh yeah
Oooh mmm mmm mmm
Oooh mmm, oooh uh
Oooh uh uh uh uh

You made the sun
You made the moon
Gave seasons change
(Woah)
You made the clouds
You put the rainbow
After the rain
(Woah)
Created time
Now which one's mine
Gave pictures frames
(Woah)
Created man
Gave him woman
Why did you do that for me?

These are the questions asked
Before I lay me down and go to sleep (ooh sometimes I wonder)
Sometimes I wonder why you decided
To keep your hands on me (hands on me)
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders
There's still one mystery
How did you manage... to love me?

You breathe the life
Right into me
Then made my heart beat
(Woah)
Created the mountains
All of the deep seas
Flowers and the trees
(Woah)
You made tomorrow
Come again
You calm the strong winds
(Woah)
After all I've done
You gave me a son
Tell me why would you do that for me?

These are the questions asked (yeah)
Before I lay me down and go to sleep (right in the middle of my prayers)
Sometimes I wonder why you decided (oh yeah)
To keep your hands on me (hands on me)
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders
There's still one mystery
How did you manage... to love me?
(How did you manage that)
How did you manage... to love me?

Said I've got to know how
(How did you manage to love)
After all the wrong I've done oh Lord
(How did you manage to love)
After I've been so bad oh Lord
(How did you manage to forgive me)
Even when I didn't believe you believed in me Lord, how
(How did you manage to forgive me)
Jesus you sacrificed your life for me
(How did you manage to forgive me)
Ooh Lord tell me
(Why did you pay the price... for me)
oooh yoooo ooooh....
(How did you manage to love)....
