SADIE

This song goes out to my mother - The one I loved and the one I lost - When it 
comes down to thinking about what my mother's done for me, the love she's given 
me. - It makes it easy to do a song like this - So this ones for you mom I love 
you

Early one Sunday morning / Breakfast was on the table / There was no time to 
eat / She said to me boy hurry to Sunday school / Filled with the long of glory 
we learned the holy story / She'll always have her dreams / Despite the things 
/ This troubled world can bring.

CHORUS

Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie

Place No one above you sweet Sadie

Well Well Well

Living in the past

Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy / Stronger than papas' old Brandy/ Always that needed 
smile / Once in awhile she would break down and cry / Sometimes she'd be so 
happy / Being with us and daddy / Standing the worst of times / Breaking the 
binds with just a simple song

CHORUS 

Oh Sadie - She's Loving my song in a special way - Sweet Sadie - Living in the 
Past - Oh she's never sinning in Love she's always winnin - my my my my my - I 
love you mama - I just can't forget how you gave me love oh no - If there's a 
heaven up above I know she's teaching angels how to love - Its a mean world 
without ya - and I surely miss you much mother - and now that your gone I'm 
gonna carry on - Cause your cryin lady - ooh sadie - When I think about the 
things that you done for me - Hey it brings a joy way down deep inside of me - 
oh oh oh oo oh - See I love you mama - Yes I do - I'll never forget you mama no 
oh oh oh
