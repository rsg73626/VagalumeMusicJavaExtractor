TRYIN' TO GET A NUMBER

oooooooooo weee!

Guess who?
It's Kells and Nelly!
Nelly you ready?
(Uh-huh)
Y'all ready?
(Uh-huh}
Okay, let's go

Chorus
Pull up to the club steppin fresh up out the hummer
Got alot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner.
In the middle of the winter I make it feel like summer,
What I'm doin?
{hey hey}
I'm tryna get a number

Pull up to the club steppin fresh up out the hummer
Got alot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner.
In the middle of the winter I make it feel like summer,
What I'm doin?
{hey hey}
I'm tryna get a number

{Nelly}
Half you niggas goin bout it all wrong (all wrong)
Lemme tell you what might help to get her home (get a home)
You think that lame masterminer might not come back round and see her
Should've listened to me, you dead wrong (dead wrong)
First, you get your swagga right
Then, go stand right by that light
Let that light hit off that ice
Lookin like you landin flights
That shit there like kryptonite
She tryna put up a fight
But she can't help it, she entised
She done looked like looked more than twice
