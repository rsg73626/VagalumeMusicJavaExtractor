GOTHAM CITY

Im lookin over the skyline of the city.
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime.
How next door the happiness lives sorrow,
And signals of solution in the sky.

(chorus)A city of justice,a city of love, a city of peace
for every one of us.
We all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City (ohhh yah)

How sleeping awake because of fear. (ohh yah)
How children are drowning in thier tears.
How we need a place where we can go,
A land where every one will have a hero (even me)
(chorus 2X)

Yet in the middle of stormy weather,
We wont' stumble and won't fall..
I know a place where all this shelter...
(repeat chorus until end)
