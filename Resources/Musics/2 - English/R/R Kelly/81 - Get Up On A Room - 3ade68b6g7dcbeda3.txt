GET UP ON A ROOM

Intro:
Baby, we both just sittin' here
We need to get somewhere private, just you and me, listen

Verse 1:
It's the middle of the night, we're both just sittin' here
I'm checkin' out your body, hot shorts and tanks you wear
Make me wanna do something, freaky to you my baby
Gotta let me know something, 'cause I need to know right here

We need to get somewhere (yeah), we can be alone (alone)
Somebody's at my crib (that's right), ou got folks at home
So can we... get up on a...

Chorus:
Can we get up on a room (get up on a room),
Baby just me and you (baby me and you)
I'll go there on you (I'll go there on you)
If we get up on this room (on a room)

Verse 2:
Bubble bath, you and me chillin' in the tub babe
I'm gonna wash your body babe
and you're gonna wash my body babe (gonna wash my body)
All I wanna do is drive you crazy (yeah baby, drive you crazy)

Chorus

Bridge:
Baby, ooh break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down (repeat 3x)

Throw your underwear on the wall
Whose the greatest lover of them all?
Who makes your love come down like waterfalls?
I thought you knew, come on baby, let's do this

Chorus (repeat throughout)

You and me chillin' on the 55th floor
Right before we bump we put the sign outside the door
The more we going up and down the more we wanting more
It's getting hot in this car, so what the hell we waiting for, can we
Can we get up on, can we get up on a room (3x)

You don't have to go far, to get a piece of me
You waint in the car, while I go get the keys
Double lock the door, for complete privacy
No room service baby, 'cause you will be the feast
We'll cuddle up with each other, and I'll go there, on this chair

Yodle-eh-e-ooh (repeat)
