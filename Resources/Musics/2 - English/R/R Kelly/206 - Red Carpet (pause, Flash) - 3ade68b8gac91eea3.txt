RED CARPET (PAUSE, FLASH)

Uh (oooh yeah) yeah (yeah yeah) check one two, it's the piper
(oooh yeah yeah yeah) aka kellz
I'm in the building right now and uh (woo)
I'm looking for nothing but steppers
(Tell me where the steppers are)
So get on the dance floor and come on
(Where are all the steppers at?) 
(Oooh) uh, I feel good (oooh)
I mean, I don't mean to brag, but uh

Custom green suit, apple gators
Hundred thousand on my wrist
Pinky shining, could be diamond
White TL linen outfits
Jump out styling
Ladies smiling
Paparazzis everywhere
Hummer, stetches
Limo, Lexus
Pull up while people stop and stare

(The whole scene looks like we're all on TV)
Sometimes life can be like a dream
When you're living on the big screen

Fancy cars, movie stars
Red carpets and big applause
Limousines and search lights
This is how we gonna do it tonight, so...
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
You and your partner are so so clean
So take a picture for the memory
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
Ooh I wanna go stepping now
Step down tension about to climb

(All I need is my partner)
(We go together like a hand in glove)
Oh DJ put the record on
Picture it's my favorite song
(Step in the name of love) 
One more (step in the name of love) yeah

(The whole scene looks like we all on TV)
Sometimes life can be like a dream
When you're living on the big screen

Fancy cars, movie stars
Red carpets and big applause
Limousines and search lights
This is how we gonna do it tonight, so...
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
You and your partner are so so clean
So take a picture for the memory
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash

You know us (you know us) woah
(You know how we like to dress up) and go out
(And go out and hit the club) 
I'm not leaving here until I take me a picture
(Camera man, just wait til I'm ready) oh yeah
(And you can take a pic)
On three ya'll, one, two, three, say cheese

Fancy cars, movie stars
Red carpets and big applause
Limousines and search lights
This is how we gonna do it tonight, so...
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
You and your partner are so so clean
So take a picture for the memory
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
Fancy cars, movie stars
Red carpets and big applause
Limousines and search lights
This is how we gonna do it tonight, so...
Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
You and your partner are so so clean
So take a picture for the memory
Pause, flash, pause, flash,
