IT'S ON (FEAT. ACE HOOD & DJ KHALED)

Alcohol music
I got me in the club so gone
It's on
Ace hood
Man i'm lying

[Hook:]
Damn that body, damn that waste
Damn that dress, damn that faces
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
All up in the club, all up in the back seat
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[R. Kelly]
She been it over
Why she look back at me
I ain't never had a chick get it up like this
Am i call it probably
More curves than a race track
And i just wanna ride it
I ain't never had chick catch my eye like this
Take me leave the club early
Got the body of a dancer
That is in the party
..Want to tell, never know exactly ..
If you're talking money there's a majorly
You make sense not to leave with me
tell that I'm late we can get the peace come on
You got me thinking.

[Hook:]
Damn that body, damn that waste
Damn that dress, damn that faces
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
All up in the club, all up in the back seat
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[R. Kelly]
The way you do it in ..
Who you wrong but it feel so right
It's so tight I'll be in till the morn
Cellphone on the charger
We gonna let it ring
I ain't never had a chick make me forget
Where I need to be
Such a former, the way i gotta sing it
I know I gotta go but it look like i'm leaving
Girl how you're doing that to the beat
You make me lose my insanity
The way you move your body amazingly
On, you got me sayin

[Hook:]
Damn that body, damn that waste
Damn that dress, damn that faces
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
All up in the club, all up in the back seat
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Ace Hood:]
Damn shawty she know she damn wrong
With that dress fitting you i think it's painted on
Whine fine dime hope that you came alone
Even if you beating to that lane nigga gone
Sight narra cube is painted aqua
But is such a movie girl you deserve an oscar
Kicking with the flies niggas dinner time i'm lost
P**sy good swear i might..Sending me a sponsor
And I could truly be the liquor talking
Worst fresher like a body then it's office
Yeah and it ain't hard to tell em all one
Pitching to me i guarantee i had a home run
From the..To the counter to my best friend
Know what's on when i'm lonely let the phone ring down that body
Far beyond the hottie
But my nigga kills ain't no cuffing at the party
But i'm

Damn that body, damn that waste
Damn that dress, damn that faces

All up in the club, all up in the back seat
All up in the crib, all up in the bed like
