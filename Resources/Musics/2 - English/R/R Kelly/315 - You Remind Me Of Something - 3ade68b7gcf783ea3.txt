YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING

You remind me of something 
I just can't think what it is 

Chorus: 
You remind me of my jeep; I wanna ride it 
Something like my sounds, I wanna pump it 
Girl you look just like my cars; I wanna wax it 
And something like my bank account, I wanna spend it 

It's something about your love that's got me going crazy 
Baby you know I want you real bad 
And girl I really like your freaky style 
How can I be down with you? 
So get a little closer to my ride 
I wanna get to know you lady 
And hip me up on how to get inside you - listen pretty baby 
I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it is all I wanna do for you baby 
Girl it's something kind of sexy goin' on about you 

Chorus 

Now I would like to take you for a ride 
Girl you know we'll have so much fun 
And give you everything your body needs 
Satisfaction guaranteed 
So pull up to my bumper and 
let the system sound 
Girl, I bet cha' I can drive you crazy 
And let me be the one to drop you off - 
babe listen to me 
I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it is all 
I wanna do for you baby 
Girl it's something kind of sexy 
goin' on about you 

Chorus
