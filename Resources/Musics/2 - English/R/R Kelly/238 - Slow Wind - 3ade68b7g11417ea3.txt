SLOW WIND

R. Kelly - Slow Wind 

[Verse 1]
Girl I want to be alone with you
Just To See what you can do
ow you'r dancin' all over me
Baby this is like some kind of fantasy
The way you move your teasing girl
So tonight I want you in my world

[Bridge]
There you go again girl on my mind
See you in my dreams all the time

[Chorus]
Now will you wind for me

Put your voodo on me babe
