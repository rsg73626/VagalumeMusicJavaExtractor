IT'S CHRISTMAS DAY

If I could give Santa my wish list
Every single day would be Christmas
I'd send the whole world from me a box of peace, yeah
And if there were one thing I could stop
It would be the breaking of hearts
Then the world would sing in perfect harmony

Hello, good morning, everyone
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
It's about to be a joyous one
It's Christmas Day, yeah
I'm so excited to open gifts
The spirit of Christmas, no denying it
And all the world is filled with cheer
'Cause it's Christmas Day, yeah

If I could decorate the perfect tree
Only would hang the love of you and me
Put it on display for the whole world to see, oh baby
Taking pictures for memory's sake
Cuddle you by the fireplace
Then bring joy to the love that we both made, oh

Hello, good morning, everyone
(Good morning, yeah)
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
It's about to be a joyous one
It's Christmas Day, yeah
(And I'm so excited, yeah)
I'm so excited to open gifts
(Open my gifts, yeah)
The spirit of Christmas, no denying it
(No denying it)
And all the world is filled with cheer
'Cause it's Christmas Day, yeah

Oh, the whole world gather around to see what
Happens when you spread the spirit of love
You get peace, you get joy, happiness and all
World, this is your wake-up call

Hello, good morning, everyone
(Good morning, everyone, yeah)
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
It's about to be a joyous one
It's Christmas Day, yeah
(And I'm so excited)
I'm so excited to open gifts
(To open all my gifts)
The spirit of Christmas, no denying it
(And the whole world, yeah)
And all the world is filled with cheer
'Cause it's Christmas Day, yeah
(Oh my)
