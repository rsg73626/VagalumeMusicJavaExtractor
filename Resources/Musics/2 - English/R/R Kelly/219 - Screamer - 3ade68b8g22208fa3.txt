SCREAMER

[Verse 1]
Slowly goin in hand on her mouth 
bout to have sex while its people in my house
she aint really caring nothin bout the party
tryin to keep her calm but she so naughty
hand on her shoulder while im rollin it 
lookin in the mirror while im stroking it 
then she pull away and i dont get it 
she ready i can tell the way she holdin it
o except one thing she likes lil mama dont kno how to act when im hittin from the back (yea)
cause shes moanin loud and she scracthin me 
shes goin wild and shes grabbin me 

[pre-chrous] 
about to make the bed break we rockin it break we pushin it 
i know they're hearin it 
But she dont want me to take it out keep goin
and i dont really wanna take it out

[Chorus]
She says theres somethin freaky about the other people bein on the other side of the door shawty is a screamer 
shawty is a screamer
breathe breathe hit it rest 
breathe breathe hit it rest

[verse 2]
pullin on her hair grabbin her neck 
she give me full control the up most respect 
and our love in the air our love in the air
shes about to make me forget that im a playa 
she yank me i spank her she say spank me more
i spank her again and now we all on the floor floor floor
now im goin lower lower lower
then she turned over 
she say she never had a man do it like that 
i say i never heard somebody moanin like that 
cause shes bitin her lips and makin faces 
as i ram her hips we goin crazy

about to make the bed break we rockin it break we pushin it 
i know they're hearin it 
But she dont want me to take it out keep goin
and i dont really wanna take it out

[Chorus]
She says theres somethin freaky about the other people bein on the other side of the door shawty is a screamer
