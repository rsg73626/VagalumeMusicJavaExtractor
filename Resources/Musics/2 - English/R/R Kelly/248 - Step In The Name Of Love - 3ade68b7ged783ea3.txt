STEP IN THE NAME OF LOVE

Many lovers has come, and
Many lovers have gone.
Similar to an old fashion song
<<A thousand years from now
We'll be still putting it down my baby. >>

You can change the frame, 
But the picture remains the same.
Similar to the sun after the rain.
<<Thousand years from now, weâ€™ll
Be still puttin' it down my baby>>

Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here).
Cause, my whole has been full of joy every since
You came here...Girl

<<Goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around,>>
<<Goes around, goes around, goes around, you spin me>>

My whole world goes around, 
Because you spin me yeah <<spin me>>
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wannaâ€¦

<<Snap in the name of love, snap in the name of love>> (Snap my fingers) 
<<Clap in the name of love>> (Clap my hands yeah) 
<<Step in the name of love>> (Step from side to side)
<<Groove in the name of love>> (Grooove and it's alright)

Some believes in love,
And some people don't
Similar to a story, when it's told.
A thousand years from now
Weâ€™ll be still puttinâ€™ down my baby
Some have cross the finish line and some gave up.
It's like moving a mountain 
Love can be just that tough  yeah.
