I WISH

Chorus1A:
I wish,I wish,I wish
(To every city,every hood
and every block)
I wish,I wish
(Ghetto America)
I wish,I wish,I wish,
I wish,I wish,I wish

Verse1
Rollin' through the hood 
Just stopped to say what's up
And let you know your baby
boy aint doin' so tough
Even though you passed 
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night
cryin' tears
just thinkin' about those days
You used to talk to me 
Smilin' while I'm sippin'on 
this Hennessy
And remember we'd brag on 
how rich we would be
To get out this hood was 
like a fantasy

Pre-Chorus
And now you hear my songs 
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know 
the half
I would give it all up just to
take on ride with you
How I used to kick it on the 
front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and 
smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party
joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

Chorus1
I wish that I could 
hold you now
I wish that I could
touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you 
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place 
Even though I can't see 
your face
I know you're smilin'
down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this 
thug life
I'll see you again someday 
I wish,I wish,I wish,
I wish,I wish,I wish

Verse2
Ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could 
just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say
Boy,you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of
my unhappiness
Man,I swear this shit gets
heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me
shootin' this real shit off
like a gun
Mmmm I wonder how my friends 
would treat me now
If I was iced up with a
Bentley and a house 
That's why
Fake-ass niggas
get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass player get a real
player hatin'em
"Honey Love" goes platnium
and y'all ass come 'round
But y'all don't wanna raise 
the roof
Until my shit is goin' down

Pre-Chorus
And now you hear my songs 
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know 
the half
I would give it all up just to take 
one ride with you 
How I used to hoop off in
them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop
on weekends
With you
your family called the morning
of the tragic end
Damn..my condolences

Chorus

Verse3
Voices in my head
Be tellin' me to come to church
Say the lord is the only way for
you to stop the hurt 
Dreaming of windows
Black-tinted like a hearse
But waking up to life sometimes
seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a
better man 
And I try to keep it real with my
homies, man
Want me to save the world
I don't understand
How did I become the leader of
a billion fans

Pre-Chorus
And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears and
what everybody's sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know 
the half
I would give it all up just to take
one ride 
With you
How I used to street perform
on Friday
With you
and how I'd go to church on
Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them
stones at me
Somebody pray for me

Chorus
