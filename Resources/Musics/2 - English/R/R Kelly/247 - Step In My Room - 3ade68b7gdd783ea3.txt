STEP IN MY ROOM

Yo. What's up baby? 
I don't see any sign on my door that says it's closed 

Chorus: 
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
In my room and I know you're gonna like it baby 
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
In my room 

Finally we're all alone so lock all the doors and unplug the phone 
I wanna take you where passion lies 
Girl you want my lovin'; I can see it in your eyes 
Baby don't hold back the feelin' - just bring your body to me 
And I'm gonna give you everything you need 

Chorus 

Makin' sweet love 'til morning comes 
Still lovin' you after it's said and done 
And doin' those things you want me to do to you baby 
Like goin' down on you by the fireplace 
Baby don't hold back the feelin' - just bring your body to me 
And I'm gonna give you everything you need 

Chorus 

Hey there lady, you drive me crazy 
Sexy lady, you drive me crazy 

Chorus
