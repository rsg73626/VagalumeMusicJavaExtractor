ANOTHER DAY

Think i'm in love with you
You've helped me stopped screaming
You've made me start dreaming
There's nothing that i can't do
'cause anything's possible
With you...

Now i can amount to so much more
You're the one who opened up the door
Opened up my eyes
And i won't waste another day
I won't comprimise...
The new sound of me today

I think that i should show you
What it feels like to know you
What it feels like to love you!
But what am i supposed to do?
It's hard to explain these things
With you...

Now i can amount to so much more
You're the one who opened up the door
Opened up my eyes
And i won't waste another day
I won't comprimise...
The new sound of me today

Now i will show you
What it feels like to know you
What it feels like to love you!
I know what i'm supposed to do
I'm able to explain these things
With you now!

Now i can amount to so much more
You're the one who opened up the door
Opened up my eyes
And i won't waste another day
I won't comprimise...
The new sound of me today
