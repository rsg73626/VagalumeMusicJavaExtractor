AN EMPTY HEART

I'm stuck here, with an empty heart
I stop here, with nowhere to start
You never cease to amaze me
How could it all end so quickly?

All the time you took
Not even one of look
Of joy or love on your face...
I'm losing my sight
I'm losing my mind
Thoughts thrown all over the place...

The more you push me, the more you pull away
The things you told me, made me want to stay
To stay here with you today

I'm stuck here, with an empty heart
I stop here, with nowhere to start
You never cease to amaze me
How could it all end so quickly?

You'd never smile
Not for awhile
Remember those times we had...
I'm losing my faith
I'm losing my drive
You've made me so sad...

The more you push me, the more you pull away
The things you told me, made me want to stay
To stay here with you today

I'm stuck here, with an empty heart
I stop here, with nowhere to start
You never cease to amaze me
How could it all end so quickly?

Losing my sight...
Losing my mind...
Losing my faith...
Losing my drive...

Without you I can't survive!

I'm stuck here, with an empty heart
I stop here, with nowhere to start
You never cease to amaze me
How could it all end so quickly?
