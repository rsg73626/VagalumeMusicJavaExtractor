YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME

I get on the phone and I start talking
I just wanna talk but you start screaming
Maybe we should take a walk, just try to settle this with me
Or maybe I should just go out and rock
'Cause I can tell, all you wanna do is be free...
... But you hardly know me at all

You hardly know me and I hardly know you
You think you know me
... But you have no idea what I'm going through

So you're planning to end this all with that knife
It must suck to be you
Because I'm thinking of leading my own life
A new life without you
Maybe we should take a walk, just try to settle this with me
Or maybe I should just go out and rock
'Cause I can tell, all you wanna do is be free...
... But you hardly know me at all

You hardly know me and I hardly know you
You think you know me
... But you have no idea what I'm going through

This isn't that hard to figure out
I'm just the one you'd rather be without
If you would take a look, you might see...
... You think you know me...
... But you hardly know me at all

You hardly know me and I hardly know you
You think you know me
... But you have no idea what I'm going through
