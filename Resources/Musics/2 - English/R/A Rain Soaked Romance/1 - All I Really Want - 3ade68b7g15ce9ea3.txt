ALL I REALLY WANT

Don't walk away...
Don't make me cry
Don't try to hurt me
Don't try to make me die
Even though you're killing me...

Do you know how much it hurts...
When you think things were changing for the better
When it was only for the worst?

I don't want your love
I don't need to be part of your soul
All I really want
Is to hear the sound of rock & roll
Yeah... Get down

Don't lecture me
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't torture me
I should tell you what's best for you
I think it's time that we were through...

Do you know how much it hurts...
When you think things were changing for the better
When it was only for the worst?

I don't want your love
I don't need to be part of your soul
All I really want
Is to hear the sound of rock & roll
Yeah... Get down

Yeah, yeah, yeah... Get down

(Instrumental Break)

Do you know how much it hurts...
When you think things were changing for the better
When it was only for the worst?

I don't want your love
I don't need to be part of your soul
All I really want
Is to hear the sound of rock & roll
Yeah... Get down
