POUR MY HEART OUT

I can hardly breathe
This is taking over me
You were my everything...
I thought you'd never leave

I guess you'll never know...
It's just so hard to show...
I could never let you go

Why won't you look?
Why can't you see?
That you're forever inside of me
Why can't we talk?
Why do you scream?
I'm just pouring my heart out to you...
Why don't you pour it all out to me?

You were once my love
You were once my life
You once made me approve of myself...
Now I'm tied down
And now you're just messing around (with my head)
You've gone from my love...
To somebody else

I guess you'll never know...
It's just so hard to show...
I could never let you go

Why won't you look?
Why can't you see?
That you're forever inside of me
Why can't we talk?
Why do you scream?
I'm just pouring my heart out to you...
Why don't you pour it all out to me?

You want to get in, and I want to get out...
Let me in... Let me out...
Let me out

I guess you'll never know...
It's just so hard to show...
I could never let you go

Why won't you look?
Why can't you see?
That you're forever inside of me
Why can't we talk?
Why do you scream?
I'm just pouring my heart out to you...
Why don't you pour it all out to me?
