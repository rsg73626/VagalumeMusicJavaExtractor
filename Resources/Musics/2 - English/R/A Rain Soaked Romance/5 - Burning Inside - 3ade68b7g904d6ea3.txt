BURNING INSIDE

I can feel it all in my gut
I know you'd wanna kill me right now
It's so hard to keep this pain shut
I've got to find my way out, how?

Will the screaming ever stop?
Will I be the one to drop...
Down flat on my lonely fate

You're doing it again
It's tearing me apart
End of a fight again
Another one to start
It's burning me inside
Why can't I run and hide?
And save all these tears I've cried...

Why can't you just forget the lies?
You're stalking me with memories
Just try to look into my eyes
And find a way to cure this disease

Will the screaming ever stop?
Will I be the one to drop...
Down flat on my lonely fate

You're doing it again
It's tearing me apart
End of a fight again
Another one to start
It's burning me inside
Why can't I run and hide?
And save all these tears I've cried...

I can't believe you'd do it
I think I will right now, too
All we wanted was to commit...
It's so hard living without you

Will the screaming ever stop?
Will I be the one to drop...
Down flat on my lonely fate

You're doing it again
It's tearing me apart
End of a fight again
Another one to start
It's burning me inside
Why can't I run and hide?
And save all these tears I've cried...
