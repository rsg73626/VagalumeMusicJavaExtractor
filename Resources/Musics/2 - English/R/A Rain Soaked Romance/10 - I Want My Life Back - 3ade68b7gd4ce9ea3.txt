I WANT MY LIFE BACK

(I want my life back, give my life back to me now)

Ever since I was with you
I haven't known which way's wrong or right
Ever since we've been through
I've been sitting here, wondering why
Wondering why all we ever did was fight
Why couldn't we make it right?
I just want to make this right...

I try to smile, I try to laugh, I try so hard to just move on
But I just can't seem to leave you in the past
It's killing me, destroying me
Give me one more chance and you will see
I want my life back, give my life back to me now

I walk into a crowded room
I try to scream but nothing comes out
Then my sweetest frustrations bloom
And now you've left me drowning in doubt
My head's spinning, and you'll keep winning
I can't keep losing, it's burning me up...

I try to smile, I try to laugh, I try so hard to just move on
But I just can't seem to leave you in the past
It's killing me, destroying me
Give me one more chance and you will see
I want my life back, give my life back to me now

... I guess I tried way too hard to just make things right
I just wanted to make this right...
I can't keep losing, I'm moving on, holding onto you was so wrong
You can't keep winning, I'm on my way
And it's burning me up...

I try to smile, I try to laugh, I try so hard to just move on
But I just can't seem to leave you in the past
It's killing me, destroying me
Give me one more chance and you will see
I want my life back, give my life back to me now
