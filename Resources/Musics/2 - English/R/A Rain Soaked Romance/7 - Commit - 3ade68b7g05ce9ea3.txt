COMMIT

I'm lying here, dying of paranoia
All the things you never said...
All the things you never meant...
Burning endlessly in my head
You think you know me... but you have no idea

All the pain you've caused, for me... (all the pain)
There's no way I can manage to get free

You can make the right choice, and choose to admit it...
Or you can do even better, and commit

Oh, please just look away...
And stop trying to hurt me
You've done more than enough, and I'm putting it to an end
All the bruises and the scars will never get a chance to mend

All the pain you've caused, for me... (all the pain)
There's no way I can manage to get free

You can make the right choice, and choose to admit it...
Or you can do even better, and commit

Oh... Oh... Oh...
Will you stop for a moment
Quit turning away...
There's still one more thing
That I have left to say...

All the pain you've caused, for me... (ALL THE PAIN!)
There's no way I can manage to get free

You can make the right choice, and choose to admit it...
Or you can do even better, and commit

Ohhh... ohhh... ohhhhh...
