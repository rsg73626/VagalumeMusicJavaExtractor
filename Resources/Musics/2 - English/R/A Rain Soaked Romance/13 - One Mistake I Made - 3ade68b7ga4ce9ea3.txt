ONE MISTAKE I MADE

I'm sitting here
Thinking of all the things you said now
I'm torn apart
By mistakes that I thought would help me
Lying face-down
Holding my head in my hands to see
Silence broken
With my words unspoken somehow

You said I have a need to be loved
Yeah, that's a need to be loved by you
And this one mistake I made last night
I'll do anything to make it right
To make this right again, to make it true

Can't stop writing
The things I could do to make myself better
No more fighting
The dreams I used to have about you at night
Barely breathing
My tears are slowly making me lose my site
Sacraficing
Almost every night we used to share together

You said I have a need to be loved
Yeah, that's a need to be loved by you
And this one mistake I made last night
I'll do anything to make it right
To make this right again, to make it true

All those kisses never ending my head
Now I'm lying silently in my bed
With you screaming in my head (screaming in my head)
All because of this one mistake I made, last night...

You said I have a need to be loved
Yeah, that's a need to be loved by you
And this one mistake I made last night
I'll do anything to make it right
To make this right again, to make it true
... For you
