GET AWAY

I sing this song
While you look me in the eyes
We were so strong
Until you told me those lies
(Those lies...)

It's been to long
You're telling me it's alright
It's all so wrong
Let me get away tonight
Let me get away from you tonight

This is too hard
Why do you love me like that?
Back at the start...
Don't even know where you're at
(Where you're at...)

It's been to long
You're telling me it's alright
It's all so wrong
Let me get away tonight
Let me get away from you tonight

Why do you love me like that?
Here we are, right back at the start
Don't even know where you're at, where you're at...

...'Cause it's been too long
You're telling me it's alright
I sing this song...
Let me get away from you tonight!

It's been to long
You're telling me it's alright
It's all so wrong
Let me get away tonight
Let me get away from you tonight
