ONE OF US

There's days when I feel like pulling the trigger
But that's only when I'm so out of it...
...I can't even feel my fingers

So much to say, and the clock's tickin' away
I'm gonna let it all out, and I'm gonna get my way, today

And now I'm standing in front of 50 thousand plus
Screaming out these words like I'd always do back home
But back home, I'd only ever scream out alone
And I see you all standing in the crowd, watching over
Wishing you were living exactly like one of us

I look in the eyes of all of you in the crowd
I feel your hearts beating to the sound
The sound I rehearsed a million times, over and over before
Just to get here, I belt it out to everyone around the world

So much to say, and the clock's tickin' away
I'm gonna let it all out, and I'm gonna get my way, today

And now I'm standing in front of 50 thousand plus
Screaming out these words like I'd always do back home
But back home, I'd only ever scream out alone
And I see you all standing in the crowd, watching over
Wishing you were living exactly like one of us

And tonight I'll scream yet sing these words out to you
I dedicate my life to giving each and every one of you
The sound of the music that keeps you thinking and living, yeah, going strong
And you can depend on us for as long as we live

So much to say, and the clock's tickin' away (tickin' away)
I'm gonna let it all out, and I'm gonna get my way, today (today)

And now I'm standing in front of 50 thousand plus
Screaming out these words like I'd always do back home
But back home, I'd only ever scream out alone
And I see you all standing in the crowd, watching over
Wishing you were living exactly like one of us
