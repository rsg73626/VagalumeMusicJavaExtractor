COME AND RESCUE ME

Days go by and it's always raining
Weeks fly by and I'm still left wondering
Why all this pain? You have no idea...
Here it comes again... I just wanna see ya

I've been waiting forever, just to give my heart to you
Can we make it through?
I can never let you fade away...
So come and rescue me, so we can stay...

How come everytime I call...
You never have anything to say at all?
You're not listening to me anymore...
All you choose to do is just ignore
And here it comes again...

I've been waiting forever, just to give my heart to you
Can we make it through?
I can never let you fade away...
So come and rescue me, so we can stay...

I'm dying and I'm crying out loud, without you...
So come and rescue me...
...'Cause I need you

I've been waiting forever, just to give my heart to you
Can we make it through?
I can never let you fade away...
So come and rescue me, so we can stay...
