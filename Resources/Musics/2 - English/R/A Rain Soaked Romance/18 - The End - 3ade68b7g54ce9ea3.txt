THE END

I try to talk to someone but they never understand
The words the pour out of my mouth like rain, still can't stop the pain
It seems I'm dying, I have nowhere to go anymore
I swear I'm trying, when will it be like it was before?

Could this be the end?
I'm standing on the edge
Crying out but no one's listening
Just wanna run from all their whispering
... And now I'm slowly coming to an end

The cut's so deep it wouldn't even bleed
You're the one who made it, and I can't take it
So close to the vein, it's killing me, the pain
If I could just manage to get up and kill you
I can't tell you how much I fucking want to

Could this be the end?
I'm standing on the edge
Crying out but no one's listening
Just wanna run from all their whispering
... And now I'm slowly coming to an end

Could this be the end?
It seems I'm dying...
Could this be the end?
I swear I'm trying...
Could this be the end?
Could this be the end...

... Of me...

Could this be the end?
I'm standing on the edge
Crying out but no one's listening
Just wanna run from all their whispering
... And now I'm slowly coming to an end
