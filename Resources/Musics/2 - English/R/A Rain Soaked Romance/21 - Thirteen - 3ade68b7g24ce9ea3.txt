THIRTEEN

I can't sleep
And I feel so weak
I can't dream
I just want to scream...

And all these dreams, I've chased away
(The sickness is digging deep within)
It's getting harder to fight each day...

I am a girl, I'm only thirteen
My body rots, 'cause I won't f*cking eat
I break these thoughts, in my lover's dream
I squeeze his heart... until it doesn't beat
(Until it doesn't beat...)

I always thought I'd get somewhere
Now I'm just living in despair...
I used to approve of myself...
... Now I'm just somebody else

And all these dreams, I've chased away
(The sickness is digging deep within)
It's getting harder to live each day...

I am a girl, I'm only thirteen
My body rots, 'cause I won't f*cking eat
I break these thoughts, in my lover's dream
I squeeze his heart... until it doesn't beat
(Until it doesn't beat...)

"Will it ever beat again?" You'll ask me...
But I don't care, I just hope you're lonely...
...Lonely without me

And all these dreams, I've chased away
(The sickness is digging deep within)
It's getting harder to live each day...

I am a girl, I'm only thirteen
My body rots, 'cause I won't f*cking eat
I break these thoughts, in my lover's dream
I squeeze his heart... until it doesn't beat
(Until it doesn't beat...)
