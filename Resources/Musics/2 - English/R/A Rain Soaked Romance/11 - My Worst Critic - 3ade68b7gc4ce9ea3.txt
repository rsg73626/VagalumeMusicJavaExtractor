MY WORST CRITIC

Sitting here
Writing my thoughts down on paper
Lacking fear
You're still wishing you could save her
When she's been saved by someone else

Soon you'll be walking through my door
I'm not lacking this fear anymore
I have to watch everything I do, now
All because my worst critic is you
My worst critic is you

Lost again
In the evil glares you give me
So much pain
I'm one of the rare things
That you would ever try to see

Soon you'll be walking through my door
I'm not lacking this fear anymore
I have to watch everything I do, now
All because my worst critic is you
My worst critic is you

Why can't you think better of me?
When will your thoughts ever change?
Who am I supposed to be?
My ideas changing constantly...
Changing constantly for you

Soon you'll be walking through my door...

I'm not lacking this fear anymore
I have to watch everything I do, now
All because my worst critic is you
My worst critic is you
