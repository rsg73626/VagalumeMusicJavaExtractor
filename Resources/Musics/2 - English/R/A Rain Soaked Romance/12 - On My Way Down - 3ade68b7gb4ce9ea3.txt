ON MY WAY DOWN

Such bitter words, for such a sweet talker
It's times like these, I wonder why I even bother
Trying to get to you...
It's like trying to swim through a tital wave everytime
And I want you...
To realize I'm trying to tell you, please just change your mind
And I need you...

Ocean currents, sending you away...
Away from here
I'll keep swimming, trying not to drown...
... In my fear
But for now, I'm on my way down

On my way down...

It was only days ago, we were walking on that shoreline
You'd tell me everything, I'd always tell you the same
And it's days like these, I'm wishing you were still mine
Now you're ignoring me, acting like I'm the one to blame...

Ocean currents, sending you away...
Away from here
I'll keep swimming, trying not to drown...
... In my fear
But for now, I'm on my way down

On my way down...

Look what you've left me with
There's nothing left to breathe
There's no one left to feel
There's no one left that's real
There's nothing left to say
And I'm slipping away...

Ocean currents, sending you away...
Away from here
I'll keep swimming, trying not to drown...
... In my fear
But for now, I'm on my way down

On my way down...
