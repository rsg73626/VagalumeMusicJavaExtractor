VENOM INSIDE ME

There's some things you say that make me want to die
There's some times you make me feel like I'm living a lie
They gave me capsules to take for this pain
That you've created inside me
It's not a surprise, your words marked a stain
A stain that's soaked into my body
Only you can make it fade away
But this is one game you have to play

It's killing me, it's haunting me
There is a venom inside me
It's tearing me down, it's soaking me up
There is a venom inside me...
...And it's hidden where you can't see

The light from outside, shines through my window pane
And the sun is out, yet there's still pouring rain
Take a look, you never know what you might find
Out there is something that you could use
For the good of mankind
Things didn't work out that way for me
And you're just too blind to see...
... The venom inside me

It's killing me, it's haunting me
There is a venom inside me
It's tearing me down, it's soaking me up
There is a venom inside me...
...And it's hidden where you can't see

... You're just too blind to see...
... The venom inside me...
Once I find you, I'll drive you crazy...
... With the venom inside me!

It's killing me, it's haunting me
There is a venom inside me
It's tearing me down, it's soaking me up
There is a venom inside me...
...And it's hidden where you can't see
