PERFECT

On the outside
She thinks her life is just the sh*t
As for the inside
She's about ready to call it quits
And when she's with him
All she ever has to say is "sorry!"
And when he's with me
Well that should be another story

Perfect is an image that she likes to pose
Bottled up inside, is what no one really knows
That style is just something I wouldn't do
This is all because I'm perfect for you!

Not one person knows
Why she's always felt this way inside
Although I know
Why she suddenly has this state of mind
All the things she chose
To mess up those thoughts that were in track
She'll never expose
The reasons why she's never looking back

Perfect is an image that she likes to pose
Bottled up inside, is what no one really knows
That style is just something I wouldn't do
This is all because I'm perfect for you!

Now she's lost inside
Doesn't know what she will find...
Doesn't know when she'll unwind...
As for the outside
She thinks her life is just the sh*t!
And I think I'm ready to call it f*cking quits!

Perfect is an image that she likes to pose
Bottled up inside, is what no one really knows
That style is just something I wouldn't do
This is all because I'm perfect for you!
