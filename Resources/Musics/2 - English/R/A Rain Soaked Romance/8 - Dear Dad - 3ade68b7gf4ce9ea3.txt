DEAR DAD

You don't know how hard it is
Watching her love someone else
The way he calls her "honey"
It makes me feel oh so sick
You're the one I'll always miss
There's nothing that I can do
I've never felt so lonely
Please don't tell me it's a trick

I know I should've been there for you
Truth is, I didn't know what the hell to do...

Dear Dad
I'm writing to tell you how I feel
Dear Dad
I'm writing to ask you "is this real?"
Dear Dad
I'm predicting all the words you'll say
Dear Dad
I'm hoping you'll come back one day
... As I seal the envelope shut

You left me, unexpected
And you left me, rejected
Now nobody's listening
It's like I'm held up on a string
A string sure to let me fall
These words I say, they spread like ashes
And these tears I lay, on my eyelashes, yeah

I know I should've been there for you
Truth is, I didn't know what the hell to do...

Dear Dad
I'm writing to tell you how I feel
Dear Dad
I'm writing to ask you "is this real?"
Dear Dad
I'm predicting all the words you'll say
Dear Dad
I'm hoping you'll come back one day
... As I seal the envelope shut

It's okay now, it's okay
Come back to me now, come back to me
I know it won't be easy...

I know I should've been there for you
Truth is, I didn't know what the hell to do...

Dear Dad, I'm writing to tell you...

Dear Dad
I'm writing to tell you how I feel
Dear Dad
I'm writing to ask you "is this real?"
Dear Dad
I'm predicting all the words you'll say
Dear Dad
I'm hoping you'll come back one day
... As I seal the envelope shut
