ARGUEIN' ALL THE TIME

I've figured out this life I'm livin' doesn't have to be the way it is now
I've thought about it and I truely have no idea how to get the hell out
So many directions to head in, but I can't see any of them clear
And now all our heads are left spinning
Can we just get the fuck out of here!?

There was so many good times
And there were so many bad crimes
But look at what we've made ourselves a part of
We'd walk the alleyways and be castaways
We'd talk in rhyme but now we've got walls to climb
'Cause we're just arguein' all the time

You can all run, but you can't all hide
It's not hard for you to feel, the pain I hold deep inside
I've lived for this for so long, but I'm tired of living
I've left and now I'm long, gone, gone...

There was so many good times
And there were so many bad crimes
But look at what we've made ourselves a part of
We'd walk the alleyways and be castaways
We'd talk in rhyme but now we've got walls to climb
'Cause we're just arguein' all the time

Somebody take me away
'Cause I'm not wasting another day...

There was so many good times
And there were so many bad crimes
But look at what we've made ourselves a part of
We'd walk the alleyways and be castaways
We'd talk in rhyme but now we've got walls to climb
'Cause we're just arguein' all the time
