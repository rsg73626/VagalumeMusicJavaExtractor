THE TRUTH FROM ME

You might think I don't love you
But the truth from me is
I'm fucking crazy about you

It's a new year, I swear I've said this before
Can you believe it's been four?
And we're still going strong...
For such a far distance apart
I think that's pretty long

Come on, wouldn't you agree?
You're the best thing that ever happened to me...

You might think I don't love you
But the truth from me is
I'm fucking crazy about you

Sometimes when I call, you don't have anything to say
I hate it when our conversations turn out this way
Now, if only you were here
We could say and do so much more...
Whoa, I thought I heard you knocking at my door

You might think I don't love you
But the truth from me is
I'm fucking crazy about you

I'm sorry if I ever get boring to you
But all I need to get going, is just one more story
(If you know what I mean)

Come on, wouldn't you agree?
You're the best thing that ever happened to me...

You might think I don't love you
But the truth from me is
I'm fucking crazy about you
