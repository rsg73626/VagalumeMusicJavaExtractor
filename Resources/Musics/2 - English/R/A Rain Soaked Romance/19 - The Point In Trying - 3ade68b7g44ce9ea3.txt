THE POINT IN TRYING

There's something on my mind
I just can't write it down
There's something I can't find
It'll never come around...
This thing makes me so blind
There's nothing I can do or say
I'll leave it all behind
And slowly make it go away

Everytime I look in this mirror
All I see is you, that thing you do
What's the point in trying to let it go?
Try to let you know, it's so hard to show
And now I'm stuck here, still living in fear

You've got me on my knees
You're all I really have
All I can say is "please"
This tears my heart in half...
I can't stop this disease
There's nothing I can do
I'll still lie here knowing
I can keep waiting for you

Everytime I look in this mirror
All I see is you, that thing you do
What's the point in trying to let it go?
Try to let you know, it's so hard to show
And now I'm stuck here, still living in fear

There's something on my mind
I just can't write it down
There's something I can't find
It'll never come around...

Never come around
It's tearing me down
All I see is you, that thing you do
And now I'm stuck here, still living in fear!

Everytime I look in this mirror
All I see is you, that thing you do
What's the point in trying to let it go?
Try to let you know, it's so hard to show
And now I'm stuck here, still living in fear
