PARADISE

When I was a kid
I always imagined living exactly like this
On top of the world, this is one place I'll never miss
All you need to get here is a voice and a dream
But to start somewhere all you need to do is scream
And say... TAKE ME AWAY!

Take me there, take me far away from here
I hate this place, it's one of my worst fears
There's no reason why I should stay
Please... just take me away...
...To paradise

You're so sick of living your life like this
And there's nothing you can do to get away
Except coming with me
I'll never let you stay
Come on... LET ME TAKE YOU AWAY!

Take me there, take me far away from here
I hate this place, it's one of my worst fears
There's no reason why I should stay
Please... just take me away...
...To paradise

Come with me, and you'll be free
We've only got so much time left t'il the end
I'm the only one who can make your broken heart mend
I'm never letting you stay
Come on now... LET ME TAKE YOU AWAY!

Take me there, take me far away from here
I hate this place, it's one of my worst fears
There's no reason why I should stay
Please... just take me away...
...To paradise
