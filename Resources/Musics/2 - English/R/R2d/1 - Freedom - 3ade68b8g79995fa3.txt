FREEDOM

Freedom on the wings of love
Flying high above the clouds
All these things, all I ever dream of
Was just a little taste of FREEDOM

Freedom
Freedom

(chorus)
Everytime I close my eyes
I see faces in the skies
All hoping for FREEDOM

Freedom
Freedom

Freedom on the wings of desire
Flying so much higher and higher
All around the globe
People don't give up in hope of FREEDOM

Freedom
Freedom

chorus)
Everytime I close my eyes
I see faces in the skies
All hoping for FREEDOM

Life is not all about freedom
There are many more things we dream of

Not everyone wants freedom
Seriously I've seen them

Freedom
Freedom

(chorus)
Everytime I close my eyes
I see faces in the skies
All hoping for FREEDOM

(fades)

Freedom on the wings of love
Flying high above the clouds.
