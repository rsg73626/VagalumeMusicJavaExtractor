LOVE LESS

First let me apologize
Cause I know you're not gonna like this conversation
I've been kinda hard to find
And I know you deserve an explanation

Where I

Been thinking bout it
How I'm surprised at you
I'm undecided
On what I'm supposed to do
I think I'm lying
When I think I'm telling truth
Either way, that's still unfair to you

It's hard enough escaping my reflection
And thinking what he's thinking bout too
I know that all you wanted was affection
Something I could never do

What if I love less
Cause you no more stress
What if I love less
I won't hurt you babe
I won't hurt you babe
What if I love less
Cause you no more stress
What if I love less
I won't hurt you babe
I won't hurt you babe

I already know what you gon say
It's unfair to be predicting how you feeling
And maybe we can compensate
And concentrate on things that bring you healing
While I know, that you're trying to help
You should be, trying to save yourself

'Cause I

Been thinking bout it
How I'm surprised at you
I'm undecided
On what I'm supposed to do
I think I'm lying
When I think I'm telling truth
Either way, that's still unfair to you

It's hard enough escaping my reflection
And thinking what he's thinking bout too
I know that all you wanted was affection
Something I could never do

What if I love less
Cause you no more stress
What if I love less
I won't hurt you babe
I won't hurt you babe
What if I love less
Cause you no more stress
What if I love less
I won't hurt you babe
I won't hurt you babe

Believe me when I say nobody's perfect
That's something that we both know

What if what we're risking isn't worth it
What if we're supposed to let it go

What if I love less
Cause you no more stress
What if I love less
I won't hurt you babe
I won't hurt you babe
What if I love less
Cause you no more stress
What if I love less
I won't hurt you babe
I won't hurt you babe
