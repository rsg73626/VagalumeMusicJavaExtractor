BE HONEST (REMIX)

I wanna say that I didn't know
Couldn't tell or couldn't show
I wanna say it's natural
We did it to avoid the ending

I won't take it personal
We'll be fine if we take it slow
I wanna make it actual
And never mind the consequences

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm close, and I'm burning
I don't care
Take me there
You're the dose, you're the journey
I wanna go
Can I know?

[Chorus]
How do you feel tonight?
Be honest
Be honest

'Cause it's real when I'm with you
Should I say what I'm supposed to?
Should I say what I'm going through?
I don't know what you're intending

You feel my when you're trying to
Until it feels like love's through
Now I'm feeling nothing new
I don't wanna feel like I'm pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm close, and I'm burning
I don't care
Take me there
You're the dose, you're the journey
I wanna go
Can I know?

[Chorus]
How do you feel tonight?
Be honest
Be honest

If I'm being honest
This has nothing to do with you
If we're being honest
I've been thinking 'bout it more than I want to

[Chorus]
How do you feel tonight?
Be honest
Be honest
