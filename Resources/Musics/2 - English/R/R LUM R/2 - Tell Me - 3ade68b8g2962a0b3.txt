TELL ME

Half past 4: 02, tryna figure out what I'm gon' do
Dealing with the influence of you
lingering on sheet I held you to
Any other night, this would be the right place, the right time
Any other night, never would've guessed
you'd change your mind

Tell me that you want me
Tell me what I need to hear
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me near
I don't know if I'm gon' be alright
Living with the space you left outlined
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what I need to hear

Something like 5: 08, tryin to avoid what I can't change
But somehow every wall inside this place
Finds a way to look just like your face
Any other night, I could've sworn I'd done my best
Any other night, never saw the signs we'd disconnect

Tell me that you want me
Tell me what I need to hear
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me near
I don't know if I'm gon' be alright
Living with the space you left outlined
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what I need to hear

I'd be lying if I said I gave you my best
Lying if I blamed you too
I've been over it so many times in my head
I"m lying when I tell the truth
I'd be lying if I said I want someone else
Lying if I said we're through
I'd be lyin' if I said I couldn't help myself
Lying there next to you

Tell me that you want me
Tell me what I need to hear
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me near
I don't know if I'm gon' be alright
Living with the space you left outlined
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what I need to hear
