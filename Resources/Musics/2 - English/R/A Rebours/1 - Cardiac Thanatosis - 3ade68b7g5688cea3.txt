CARDIAC THANATOSIS

Love has always bade me come into her drowning pool,
But to be fair I have always been her willing ghoul.
After the last time I had to be preemptive,
I had to be aggressive and decisive.
I'm taking some drastic steps in prudence of 
The terrible, lingering force that they call "love."

My beating vulnerability is buried six-feet under swaying grass.
Lying here in dreaming suspension, waiting for the summer storms to pass.

I've renounced the need to ever feel or even care.
Now, no one can break something that simply isn't there.
With a little bit of anesthetic I cut it out with surprising ease
And carried it beyond the woods' bastions of crow-filled trees.
I've taken these drastic steps in prudence of
That terrible, lingering force that they call "love."

My beating vulnerability is buried six-feet under autumn leaves
Under all the webs of heartache that desire always seems to weave.

My beating vulnerability is buried six-feet under winter's snow,
Lying there in cynical depression, safe inside the earth and stone and cold.
My dark valentine is buried with my insecurity,
And now that I'm free from love's claws
No other hooks will ever take me.
