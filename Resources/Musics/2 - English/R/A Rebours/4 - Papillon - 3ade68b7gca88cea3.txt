PAPILLON

Standing in that café,
Not knowing what to say.
Everyone was watching
But didn't see.
Every butterfly was watching
But didn't see.
"I wasn't sure 
whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, 
or am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man."
~Zhuangzi (399 - 295 B.C.)

It is time for a new Belle Époque; 
It is time for our absinthe-drenched dreams to breathe and dance 
under the overcast gray canvas of our luminous skies.
