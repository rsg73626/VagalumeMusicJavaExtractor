NEXT TO YOU

When I wake up in the morning
And my breath just ain't so fresh
How you think I'm still beautiful
Even when my hairs a mess

When I wake up in the morning
When you're the first one that I see
You kiss me on my early cheeks
There's no place I'd rather be
Then next to you

When I'm next to you
I do things that I never do
When I'm next you
I'm next to you

And then the night will fall upon us
And I'm anxious as can be
When it's time that we crawl into bed
It'll just be you and me

And we'll talk our sleepy banter
Until we start to fall asleep
And I know I'll see you in my dreams
There's no place I'd rather be
Then next to you

When I'm next to you
I do that I things that I never do
When I'm next to you
I'm next to you
I'm next to you
I do that I things that I never do
When I'm next to you
I'm next to you
