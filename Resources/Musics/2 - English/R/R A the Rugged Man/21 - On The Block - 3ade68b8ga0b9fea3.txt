ON THE BLOCK

I mean, white rapper
There's so many of us now
White people like rap now
Ah, ah, yeah

[Chorus x2]

[R.A. in the background]
Slick Rick The Ruler, where's the vocals yo? Come in here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah-ah-ah, check out this bizarre
Ayyo! Ayyo!

[Verse One]
Remember Slick Rick The Ruler, remember MC Shan used to wear Puma
Remember Masters of Ceremony, Grand Puba
Remember Daddy Kane Aids rumor
Yo, bring it back, yo
Yo, at the rolling rinks, no skates on
Early '80's, girl chase on
Kurtis Blow listed the breaks on
Flavor Flav, Public Enemy clocks, boombox
EPMD made us proud that we was from the Boondocks
Before Boob or Steady B, Heavy D, Mouthburnin
Craig G, Shout rap version, TRUE SCHOOL
Rock Box, Run-D.M.C., true hip hop
Before Biggie and 2pac got shot, there was Scott La Rock
Before we even learned to make beats, we was in the basement
Freestylin, to 45 King breakbeats
But see, rap is corporate now
It's all about endorsments
So now the rich kids love it, so fuck them poor kids now!

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Two]
I remember when the mainstream hated rap music
When James Brown samples was the new shit
I yelled BOX like Cool J on some Krush Groove shit
Dapper Dan shit, Ms. Pac-Man shit
That's when Rakim ran shit [Ran shit]
Before Sweet T was Suga, before ??? Jack Soopafly snooka
Back when Biz Markie was busy pickin boogers
Super Lover Cee, L-y-t-e, Chill Rob G
Graffiti vandals, Jimmy Packer sex scandals
Videos, Ralph MacDaniels
Back when we didn't have the papered samples
Beasties, Chuck D, Busy Bee got ate up ??? battle Kool Moe Dee
Chubb Rock hits the Grammys, Hitman Howie Tee, Doug E. Fresh, Chill Will, Barry B
BDP, Eazy E, PRT, Lakim Shabazz, Jaz, Jay-Z, Tragedy, QB

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Three]
Markey Fresh, The Mack of Rap, now the Fat Boys are back
X-Clan, ZOOM, pro black, Mr. Bozack
Where the hoes at, I'ma go back
Before we had show DATs, no gats, no plaques
Happy Days, Fonzie and Posse
Bomb Squad, Hank Shocklee and Keith Shocklee
DITC, Kool Keith, Ced Gee
Busy Boys, Realski
Milk D, Positive K, First Priority Posse
8th grade, parents on vacation, house mackin, playin
Spin the battle in the basement, fuck ???
Misbehavein, shootin pelletguns at Dunkin Donuts
Make the police go nuts
Used their nice sticks to chock us
Old School, do stay true, Rock Stedy Crew, Zulu
Cash Money, Marvellous, Funkmaster Flex
???, Kool G, Shante, Glamorous
Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Four]
Simphony and Simphony 2
Main Source Live at the Barbeque
Nas and Akinyele debut
EZ Ice, Soul Man
Def Squad, Hit Squad
2 Live Crew videos used to keep my dick hard (OINK!)
Salt 'N Pepa Shoopin, Potholes and Plug Tunin
Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin
Shut' em down, Pete Rock producin
Just-Ice, LaToya
We had Marvin Hagler, fuck Oscar De La Hoya
Doin it, doin it too much
6th grade, I ate my first pussy
In the back of the school bus [fadin into the chorus]

[Chorus x2]
