HOW LOW

Ayyo, round and round, it's the new crew in town
The Mandingos, we get down, the Bad Brains
Rugged Man, yeah, we the type that ??? your chains
Underground shit in case you don't know our names
See I got hip hop flowin through my veins
Stop that crazy thing Jane
Jammin, the Germanan, Deutschlanden
standin, who the fuck let the Rugged Man in
I'm like you don't know how we rock the show
And ya can't see how we bout to blow
It's like ???, off-beat guitar, he chubb, with the heat up
???
You're a gangster right, why you're scared to fight?
I'm like Rugged Man eat yo, defeat yo
Educate yo, teach yo, to the beat yo

[Chorus]

Rock rock on, baby, loose control
Get on the dancefloor
I'm like what you suckers can say to me?
Throw your hands in the air if you fuck for free
And girls put that hands up if you make money
And ??? hoes, you ain't gettin shit from me
???, cock the hammer, body slammer, that's the way am I
Now party people in the place to be
You see the Rugged Man rock on the m-i-c
Capital W, H, I, T, E
Ain't no one rapper out there can fuck with me
Who we? We the D-I-double B
Do your homework, let 'em know your history
Hypnotic, hot shit robotic, dirty dance erotic
Get, get retarded

[Chorus]

If you ain't got a nickel to your name
And you still bringin home none with you then scream
You got a big fat nice juicy fat behind
You over 200 pounds, I'ma make you mine
See you in the club ??? bump and grind
Let's party like it's 1999
??? 2000 Queens, NYC
Suffolk County, me, Washington D.C.
All the dirty white people, raise the roof
All the dirty black people, raise the roof
??? hand in hand, this ain't just your ordinary jam, it's the Mandingo fam
And if you got big titties and a big fat ass
All the women in the house go get that cash
You see nobody messin with the Rugged Man
I'm back by unpopular demand

[Chorus]
