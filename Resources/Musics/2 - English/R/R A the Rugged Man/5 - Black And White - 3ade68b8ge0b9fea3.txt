BLACK AND WHITE

(feat. Timbo King)

[Intro: sample (R.A. the Rugged Man) {Timbo King}]
Do you resent the fact that people
Make a special deal out of you
Perhaps becoming a white champion in a black dominated sport?
(Yo, I fuck up anybody, shit don't matter, white, black, I'll fuck you up, you
know?)
{Yeah, that's what his mouth is sayin', see in the ring? It's a different story
You know what I mean, in the ring, that's a different story)
In the right hand corner, wearing black trunks and a throwback jersey
Black hat, and black Timberlands, from Brooklyn, New York, Timbo King!
Left hand corner, wearing white trunks, a white wife beater
And dirty white shelltoes, hailing from parts unknown, R.A. the Rugged Man!

[Timbo King]
Aiyo, we black macks, with black hats and black bats
Black Panthers, with black gats, twenty-one blackjacks
Twenty one black napsacks, black weed
Black Friday, nigga, black fistes
Black misses, Onyx, black misonic
Black tonic, black marble, ask Arnold
Black bombers, with black linen, repent black sinning
Swimmin' in black women, the Men in Black winning
Black Timb's, black jims and black ink
Black ice on, black widow's in black minks

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
In the White House, White Owl, turn the light out
White boy, night out, knock your white ass, right out
Find out, white dog, white bitch, white fist
Beat your bitch like this, white dick, white sheets
Devin make white beats, suburban kids from the white street
James Cagni, white jeep, white sox
White rocks, white cops in donut shops
White blocks, now them dead white cops
White through the night creatures, white sneakers
White wife beats, thin lips, white features
White powder, Snow White, snow, hit the ho right
White dred, slow life, white snakes, so white

[Chorus: unknown singer w, samples going in the background]
Black, white, black, white
Black, white, black, white

[Timbo King]
Black men with black belts on, black denim style
Smoke a black, come out, layin' down black cow
Black souls, lost in black holes
Black robes, fuck bitches out on Black Gold
Black seeds, black eyed peas, black pepper
Italian black leather, fade to black
Black models, sport black Marotto's
Black Moet bottles, holla back, black star power
Black rockwilder's, black nines, black on black crime
Who's skin blacker than mine?
Black spades, givin' lames black eyes
Black foot indian drive, black berries
Black Pelle Pelle's, black Israeli go to war with black Skellies
Hummer's with the Black Perelli's, Armor All
Blackball, black label, alcohol
Black ho, beat a nigga up, you know how that go

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
And then we truly white, finger, arms, ya hands is white
Square dance tight, dance in white, I'm Charles Manson white
Steal ya lab white, Rugged Man right
I rip right tight, like to fight, white knight
Blue eyed bright Christ white, nighty night light
Toys R Us light bright white, simple light's white
Nice life, nice fight white, great white hype
Why Uncle Ben's rice white? Hate life white
And get fruitcake twice, white guys recognize
See the whites in your eyes, white skin, white lies
House of Pain white, Everlast, Kurt Cobain white
Elvin, Simple and Plain white, John Wayne white

[Chorus]
