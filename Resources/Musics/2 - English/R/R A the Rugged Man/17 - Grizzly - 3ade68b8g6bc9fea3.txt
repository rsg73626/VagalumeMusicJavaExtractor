GRIZZLY

[Verse 1]
Hey yo, you see me, rock with me
Riskin to diss me
Klaus Kinsky, 6' 3'', 2-60
and then the ? is, see this great white grizzly
? blood, ain't forget the way that they did me
We're on the roof top
With the scope on the rifle
Loadin war with us, we ain't like you
Walk by you, snipe you
Holdin your head, life too, we never liked you
We Hitchcock Psycho, y'all know
Y'all never fake the shit out
Till we pull the full ? out
Rip your bitch drawers off with my dick out
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
You better watch your back
The Rugged Man know where you live at

[Chorus]
When you see the Rugged Man comin
"What you gon' do?" (R.A. sampled from "Stanley Kubrick")
When I put this pistol in your face
"What you gon' do?"
You can't hide, we're comin for you
"What you gon' do?"
I throw a brick to your Bentley window
"What you gon' do? We roll through"
When the Rugged Man rides to your neighbourhood
"What you gon' do?"
When I kick through your front door
"What you gon' do?"
When I beat you up in the club
"What you gon' do?"
My whole crew, we comin for you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Yo, see the way they lookin at us
What's the matter, you ain't seen white trash before?
(You ain't seen white trash before?)
A bunch of rowdy white boys with nothing left to live for
A bunch of rowdy white boys who live their whole life for
Theirs bellies bigger than Buddah's, a bunch of born losers
There's why we on see us broke for life with no futures
Nobody fool us, stick this society of the computers
We never ?,they never move us, we use sluts
The german, Deutschland, caucasian
Caucasoid mountain, caveman
?, Stoneage
?, Rugged Man
Breakmen, ?
Welcome to the Waste Land
Bring our whole life, bring your boys and you don't stop
Bring machine guns, bring your whole block
Me the sit on port ? on the dock, don't bring no cops
We from the Boondocks, put the gut out the toolbox
B-Boy style, walk the street with the boombox
White trash, trailer park style, eatin pork chops
? ruthless, see what you did
You must be stupid, fuckin with Stanley Kubrick

[Chorus]
When you see the Rugged Man comin
"What you gon' do?"
When I kick through your front door
"What you gon' do?"
You can't hide, we're comin for you
"What you gon' do?"
I throw a brick to your Bentley window
"What you gon' do? We roll through"
When the Rugged Man rides to your neighbourhood
"What you gon' do?"
When you see me in your front yard
"What you gon' do?"
When my dick is hard, bitch
"What you gon' do?"
My whole crew, we comin for you, you, you, you

[Verse 3]
Yo, ? warriors
Before laws, break those, take yours
Down to law force, cut your rope with the bengals
Right there force, stay depressed force
Mad wars, run up in your spot with chainsaws
Realise it, if you're ?
Realise, up on your full life is
And how it's really priceless
The Rugged Man in your crib with the bloody ice peak
Kidnap your kids, smake up the one ?
We break yours, we ? force, take weight off
Break north, off my nutsack, lick the cake off
This how shit goes, sneak to your back window
Stick the dick up your wifey, like Mandingo

[Chorus]
When you see the Rugged Man comin
"What you gon' do?"
When I put this pistol in your face
"What you gon' do?"
You can't hide, we're comin for you
"What you gon' do?"
When I kick through your front door
"What you gon' do? We roll through"
When the Rugged Man rides to your neighbourhood
"What you gon' do?"
When I beat you up in the club
"What you gon' do?"
When I run to the record label
"What you gon' do?"
My whole crew, we comin for you
"What you gon' do? We roll throught
