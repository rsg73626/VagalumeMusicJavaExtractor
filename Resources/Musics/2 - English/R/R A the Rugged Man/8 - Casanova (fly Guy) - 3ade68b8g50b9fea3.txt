CASANOVA (FLY GUY)

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Yo, yo
I'm the headliner, the first white pornographic rhymer
Banned local bar fighter
Hide your kids, pedophiler
Lowlifer, advise ya
I'm the world's illest rhyme writer
You play the background, like Casanova Rud
I'm a underground legend, slashin blood
TLC was talkin bout me when they wrote No Scrubs
I'm the shit talking rapper all the dirty hoes love
These little white boy MC's tryin to be like me
Whitey, the first white MC to be grimy
Back when Just-Ice was kickin that
Fuck shit ass bitch your mother's dick shit
That's when it all started
Walk down the street with a shotgun
Totin on jackets, trenchcoats
Look like Inspector Gadgets
"Look at that fat fuck over there
A ugly white dude with the big gut and shoulder hair
Look at the clothes he wear, barefoot
No shoes on, do even own a pair
Smell the odor over there"
Obvious, he don't care
He's a

[Chorus]
Fly guy, hey oh
A fly guy, oh oh
"Casanova"
Oh, ouee, oh
A fly guy, oh oh "fly... fly"
He's so fly
Fly guy, hey oh
Fly guy, oh oh
"Casanova"
Oh, ouee, oh
A fly guy
Ooh, "fly... fly"

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
It's the Port Jeff, Long Island house party
Open the door, see the White Trash Army
We ??? religious, we ??? with us
Lizards, rip the bible
Write our own scriptures
Scripts kitsch fixtures, pussy lickers
Tongue blisters, the ol' school five-one-sixers
Opposite of winners, played slitchers
Hillbilly shit kickers, dick swing like Dirk Diggler
In case you not feelin me, do you think that I give a fuck?
You, you, you
Bitch, you can't front on the pussy, guaranteed that I still get to fuck
You, you, you
You should wise up
Ignorant open your eyes up
Kidnap, tied up, gasoline, match, light up
You lied right up
Fuck your life up
Hate us?, You don't like us?
Join the club, sign up
I'm a

[Chorus]

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
I'm a has-been known for boastin and braggin
Babblin, battle rappin, battle me, imagine
Staggerin, batterin the soul
Low blow, beat your bladder in
Hammerin your lips, Mick Jaggerin
Imagine everlastin like Jimmy Dean 'n Marilyn
Gaggin in your mouth, put the barrel in
Better be swallowin, when you're scared to be in ???
Or take the bullet and bite it
And write shit to make the whole world recite it
That's my final answer, I do a Cool J
And live my drawers in your hamper
Rugged man's temper
Dirty this, dirty dick shit
Dirty dick you can't piss with
Hit dirty bitch with shit
You get pissed of ??? shit
License to ill, Beastie Boys
I' ma autograph on your bitch tit
Yeah, I'm that guy that you all hatin on with that bullshit album
Everybody waitin on, I'm a

[Chorus]
