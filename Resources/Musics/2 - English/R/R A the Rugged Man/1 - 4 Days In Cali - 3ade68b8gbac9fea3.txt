4 DAYS IN CALI

Everybody says that my mind's twisted
Plus when I'm homeless my phone number is unlisted
I ate your bitch pussy till my tongue ?
John L. Sullivan, street fightin ? fisting
My 4 days in California, we have to warn ya
Smack cats that don't like rap like Time Warners
Straight up sinners, break 10 Commandments
???, God probably hate us
RA the Rugged Man out in Cali, that's the latest
Why the fuck bitches don't date us?
Who give a fuck, we pay for it
You want mercy? Ask Marvin Gaye for it
My head turns grey for it
I make my own way for it
Now why they want me dead?
I'm to get bloodshed, you remember?
Get it to ya head, caucasian
Like all serial killers
Durty Crusty, that's the click
Certified bloodspillers, motherfuckers
We backstabbers like OJs
??? get this money back like my old days
Hopefully, they got dope for me out in Cali
Let's see any MC flow for me
Art official, smack you up with the pistol
Let me see ??? to
Ain't nobody miss you
Sing it

[Chorus x2:]
Think again, dead man never blink again
(Think again, dead man never blink again)
Your heart stop, never beat again
Think about that till we meet again, 'gain

I be the rugged fly guy
The do or die guy
I be like Guy sayin "Papa"
Keep on to my eye
They wanna stop me, blast my chest
You might have seen me on the Channel 5 loose
Wearing my bulletproof vest
Plus my pocket is forever ?
RA the Rugged Man aka Larry Flynt
aka Larry Holmes, peep the reach
It must be 81 inches
White like ? offences, ? is offensive
Your rap style's not impressive
Knock you out senseless
Death Wish, Vigilante
Bronson, Paul Kersey
Re-endorse me, who cursed me?
JD Walker, fat bitch stalker
Awkward, out in Cali
Or peep this New Yorker
Torture chamber, we pull out the flamer
Gon' be slayer for real
Fuck bein a player

[Chorus x2:]
Think again, dead man never blink again
(Think again, dead man never blink again)
Your heart stop, never beat again
Think about that till we meet again, 'gain

Now what the deal baby?
Keep it real baby
Now we pack steel baby
Am I crazy? Maybe
I be R-u-g, g-e-d
Hated like L-A, P-D
Who we? Rugged Man plus Overdose producer
Play us too close, we shot ya (that's right)
Now who wanna die like Princess
Why you fuck with my family, like incest
1998, annual sinfest
Lyrically there's not too many been blessed
I'm a sinner, but everybody sinnin
Ain't no pretendin, I'm cursed
But we've been cursed since the beginning

[Chorus x2:]
Think again, dead man never blink again
(Think again, dead man never blink again)
Your heart stop, never beat again
Think about that till we meet again, 'gain
