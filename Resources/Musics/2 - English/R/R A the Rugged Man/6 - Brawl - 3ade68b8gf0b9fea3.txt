BRAWL

They used to call me Bobo..
[Scratches]
R.A
He's rugged!
Alright friends, on your ???

[Verse One: R.A.]
Yo, see how they go, hip hop R-A-Hay-Ohh
I'm a special ed. student, with an A+ flow
Used to call me Bobo, Busby Berkeley
Bronson, ???, Disco Derby
I'm a modern day Ozzy Osbourne
Bitin bats heads off and bustin nuts in your pop corn
Wonderin how this ugly motherfucker got on
The whole white trash nation, rock rock on
Now wait a minute, let's bring it back a little bit
When you first started rappin, you was all on my dick
Yeah, you went multiplatinum, but you bit my shit
What you rappin is my life, you ain't live that shit
See all the others say I'm twisted, and I'm over the edge
And my whole crew they say is all sick in they heads
Sledgehammer, break pay phones, still calling
Stay out the trouble, stay home, Rugged Man, J-Zone

[Chorus: R.A. sings]
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
(It's time for a showdown, between you and I)
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit bout to get rowdy cause we brawl
(If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat)
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
(Come on sucker, let's get on]
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit bout to get rowdy cause we brawl
(??? fuckin for troubles, cause we're gonna give it to ya)

[Verse Two: R.A.]
The way we recreate shit, Rugged Man
We don't make hits, we stay broke, sleep, fuck sluts and take shits (Ah-Ah)
And roll with the real life whores that appreciate dicks
Fuck they asshole, dick full of shit, taste bitch
It's easy to criticize me for being so foul
It's worst when you lookin down a shotgun bubble (BANG!)
They say, "Rugged Man, he can't keep no deal
His mental, I like the way being broke feel"
I'm at the homeless shelter, for ??? three meals
I'm like Buster Keaton and W.C. Fields
I'ma die broke, no success
When I'll, die I'll be chocked up, jerkin off like Inxs
Now wait, this is the place where stars are born
Strictly business, too potholes in my lawn
Uzi weight a ton, public enemy #1
Don't you dare sleep on the spot that we come from

[Chorus: R.A. sings]
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
(It's time for a showdown, between you and I)
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit bout to get rowdy cause we brawl
(If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat)
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
(Come on sucker, let's get on)
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit bout to get rowdy cause we brawl
(??? fuckin for troubles, cause we're gonna give it to ya)

[Verse Three: R.A.]
Yeah, it's true motherfuckers, I'm alive and shit
The mainstream motherfuckers, tryin' to hide my shit
You hate your man's rap flow, I invented that shit
You see hoes on stage show, I invented that shit
They say I could have been, but I never been
That's bullshit, I'm a underground rap letterin
I'm like get-get-get-get, get off my dick
I'm the wrong kid you don't wanna fuck with
Call me Big Dog, Mr. Crustified Dibbs
When I think to all the devious things I did
This is a hold up, catch your ass all ??? up
Bitch drink cum, when this fat fuck roll up
Yeah, six million ways to die, choose one
True hood one, true ???, I'm the sequel
Fuck Mandingo, you can call me Drum
Stupid dumb, Long Island hoodlum

[Chorus: R.A. sings]
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
(It's time for a showdown, between you and I)
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit bout to get rowdy cause we brawl
(If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat)
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
(Come on sucker, let's get on)
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit bout to get rowdy cause we brawl
(??? fuckin for troubles, cause we're gonna give it to ya)

[Scratches]
R.A
He's, he's rugged
Fuck 'em up fat
