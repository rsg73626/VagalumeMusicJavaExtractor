MIDNIGHT THUD

Yo, yo
I will not stop runnin' 'till I'm winning the race
I can't live with myself being in second place

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Ay yo, here's a little story, something for your ear
Like the new millennium version of Paul Revere
Except this ain't fiction, this is real life here
I be 30 years old and even lasting a year
Yeah I made my mistakes, yeah I paid my dues
Hated by blacks, made enemies with jews
I was 7 years ahead of my time in '92
I said things that wasn't accepted 'till '99
It's awful, I don't care about the past no more
I don't wanna be rich, trust me, I'd rather be poor
Now think about it, known as how I never shown my face
I don't really want fame, I just want my space
Yeah, I had hard times like Run-DMC
But actually I feel pretty blessed just to be me
I never seen the penitentiary
I've been shook since I seen the ? kid in Penitentiary 3?
They say I should have been more, I should have been great
Like I'm washed up now, like it's already too late
I can feel all the hatred when I walk in the place
But y'all are too scared to say shit to my face, it's

[Chorus]
Midnight [repeated several times]
I'll come for you
When the clock strikes midnight
I'll come for you

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Ready for hell, ready for war
Yeah, it's nice to be loved but I like being hated more
All the sudden magazines give me good reviews
It used to be my name on the equal bad news
All the ? that I'm a genius, all the ? I'm bright
Like I just now became intelligent overnight
I be as 1990 grimey as I could be
And finally society can see admiring me
And finally dirty dirty boy, dirty b
Wordy wordy free, dirty boy
Yeah that's me
My father specialist 5th class Thornburn John A
A Vietnam war hero, green berret
Thaught me how to shoot guns and thaught me how to fight
Thaught to left hooking, thaught to uppercut with the right
Thaught me all about bitches, they can ruin your life
Like in his prime, look what happened to I and Mike
People wonder what it's like and how is to be me
The most underrated in hip hop history
Think I care if you disagree?
You ain't got no song out
And right now you're busy listenin' me

[Chorus]
