[Sadat X] "R-A what's the lesson for today Rugged Man"
[Sadat X] "I am the legendary..R-A"

[Verse 1]
Yo aiiyo people wonderin' where the fuck I been
At the VIP section they ain't lettin' me in
They say; maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland
They say; a white boy need a black boy to win
Uhh Bubba Sparxx did it and so did Slim
Just Blaze is hot now why don't you get with him
I watch mad rappers bite my shit and blow up
And make millions of what I created, that's tough luck
I first started gettin' coverage around the same time
Steve Stout used to carry kid and placed luggage
I seen rappers turned from sex symbols in hard throbs
To bein forgotten now they out lookin' for jobs
I seen EPMD break up
I seen my little brother Max fall asleep and he ain't never wake up
So when I rhyme listen, seriously
When I spit I'm givin' you the truth clearly who I really be
It's an audio version of reality TV
I had deals from Russell Simmonds to Master P
Even five year old white girls be rappin' today
On the playground like 'go shorty it's ya birthday' (Go, go, go..)

"Here's a little story I got ta tell"
"I am the legendary"
"R-A" "Rugged Man"

[Verse 2]
Yo yo yo I seen good days sun rays church sundays
Made love made war been rich been poor
Lost friends lost hoods lost my dough
Seen beef between Bad Boy and Death Row
I seen deceased take the life for my sisters kid
Six months on the earth is what he had to live
I seen Biggie Big L Big Pun pass away
Buffy from the Fat Boys, Jam Master Jay
I mumple 'fore they blew up with Mystikal and Jay-Z
The Neptunes came to see me at D & D
I knew this chick named Norah a lounge singer
A year later she a six Grammy award winner
I seen flatliners I seen cannabisses
I seen Lil Zane see I seen mad misses
You ran through that ten percent disses
I seen A & R's get fired for takin' pisses
Stop whinin' the fuck nobody listens
Who else riskin' they career they stick to be indifferent
Switchin' the tradition stickin' to this shit they really livin'
I don't care what's hittin
Listen this is my fuckin' life that I'm spittin

"Here's a little story I got ta tell"
"I am the legendary"
"R-A" "Rugged Man"

[Verse 3]
I made peace with myself now how bout that
I hated life I wanted to die a few years back
I was mentally ill it's hard to come back from that
But I got through it now I got my sanity back
Y'all are like H-B-O fighters get the money and fame
Get beat up like Klitschko and Sugar Shane
Or get beat like Vernon Forrest or Prince Naseem
And you all turn pussy when you get that green
I got love for Havoc from Mobb Deep
When I was broke sleepin' in the street
He hooked me up with a free beat
Alchemist you still my little buddy
Althought you stole that Royce the 5"9 +The King+ beat from me
I ain't down to sign autographs and shake ya hands
I don't want trendy ass followers as fans
I don't wanna sell records, I don't wanna be big
I don't want MTV runnin' up in my crib
I don't wanna be light in the music biz
I don't want fans that don't know who G Rap is
