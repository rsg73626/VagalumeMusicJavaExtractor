EVEN DWARVES STARTED SMALL

[R.A.] Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit [x4]

[Midget] Mommy, mommy...Daddy, daddy

[Verse 1]
You ain't never seen nobody bug the fuck out
The way that we bug the fuck out, get your bitch dug the the fuck out
Had enough now, in the club now
Hit you with the bottle, your face ??? blood now
We lowlife motherfuckers till the day we die
We live the broke life, our whole life, you hate me why
I'm just a wildin, crazy guy
Back in 19-80, I decided a died a lazy guy
Sleep all day and stay broke baby
Pop duke said to get a job
Yeah, fuck you, make me
I'm the 6'3'', 2 hundred, 60 pound version of Ron Jeremy
I'm like Federico Fellini
I'm like AC/DC, dirty deeds done cheaply
I'm the 2001 version of Eazy E
I'm the song you don't like on the Soundbombing Cd's

[Chorus]
[Midgets] We're... We... Are dwarves
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
We're... We... Are dwarves
[R.A.] Get, get, get off my dick

[Midgets] We're... We... Are dwarves (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
We're... We... Are dwarves
[R.A.] Get, get, get off my dick

[Verse 2]
Ayyo, I'm the real live version of the Madd Rapper
I'm the shit that get your dick hard in Viagra
I'm like Hearns-Hagler, I make Britney Spears wear a strap-on
And fuck Christin Aguilera
See I ain't got shit to prove, I make you feel stupid
Like "Bitch you got a nice ass, aw shit, it's a dude"
He ain't sell no records, Rugged Man, he a wack chubb
He not pretty like Eminem, he's a fuckin fat slob
In the Jacuzzi with three ugly bitches, from the neighbourhood
Pretty bitches hate me it's so good
My occupation, professional rapper
I'm a modern day poet, with 7th grade grammar

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yo, Bloodshed Hua, new style for your crew-a
Back in '92-a, what you gonna do-a
It's R.A. shit, pain shit
John Wayne shit, Orson Welles, Citizen Kane shit
??? shit, Bushwick Bill, Ganksta Nip shit
B-Boy on some grab my dick shit, Crustified Dibbs shit
Kool G, break a bitch neck shit
Unemployed, Just-Ice welfare cheque shit
I'm on some big booty ???, big breast shit
On some Bill Clinton, bustin nuts on your dress shit, respected
Ain't no rapper out there can touch my shit
Every artist in the industry can suck my dick

[Chorus]

[Midget] Please help me, please help me
Please don't tell me, please don't
I'm a midget, I'm a fuckin midget, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Mommy, I'm so scared

[R.A.] Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit [x4]

[Midget] Please help me, please help me
Please don't tell me, please don't
I'm a midget, I'm a fuckin midget, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
[R.A.] Get, get, get off my dick
