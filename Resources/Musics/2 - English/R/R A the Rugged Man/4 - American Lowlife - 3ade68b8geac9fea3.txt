AMERICAN LOWLIFE

American lowlife (lowlife)
Yo, c'mon
[girl singing:] Your dirty, crusty, ass, lowlife

[Verse One]
Yo, yo
You got the proud to tell me, let's handle this
We can do this in the parkin lot
?, some Rugged Man shit
I'm suicidal, ain't the issue
I feel like playin games, russian roulette
With a fully loaded pistol
Hold down, can you feel it ? I break that shit
Rope that fat chick with you, I take that bitch
I love this, now who wanna try to take me
I take it to the ground rapper like ?
Shit ain't all sweet, talk as cheap
I'm the white dude, you see me in the club, dancin all off beat
Inspiration, no one, don't poke fun
No gun with you, how you gonna cause the motion ?
I hate the whole world, wait the whole world hate me
My own family, lookin at me strange lady
Born to be wild, born evil
Dangerous, born lethal, I was born to ? people

[Chorus]
American lowlife, dirtbag, my team
Smelly ?, bad breath, low igene
What do I mean? Smell me, rock my belly
Call my celly up and tell me (Yo, yo, you dirty)
I'm unhealthy
American lowlife
[girl singing:] Your dirty, crusty, ass, lowlife
Lowlife, lowlife
American lowlife
[girl singing:] Your dirty, crusty, ass, lowlife

[Verse Two]
When I see you, walk away, best up down
Smack you in your face in front of your bitch, what now ?
No education, white trash moron
Doin 360s in the parkin lot ?
In the hooptie, playin mailbox baseball
On the playground, shooting little kids with paintballs
Crucifie you, real life Stigmata
You tryin to win fights, runnin backwards like Oscar
Dirty white boy, dirty dirty, filthy filthy
Half hillbilly, half the world wanna kill me
Come and get some, underground rap legend
Call bitches birds, call birds ?
Cops and robbers, offences
Run to your backyard
I'm the type that try to act large
In the chinese whorehouse, get my back massage
I get your bitch pregnant, you take the bitch to Le Mans

[Chorus]
American lowlife, dirtbag, my team
Smelly ?, bad breath, low igene
What do I mean? Smell me, rock my belly
Call my celly up and tell me (Yo, yo, you dirty)
I'm unhealthy
American lowlife
[girl singing:] Dirty, crusty, ass
Lowlife, lowlife
American lowlife
[girl singing:] Your dirty, crusty, ass, lowlife

[Verse Three]
Hold up, you see me wild out, that's what I do
Get arrested, startin riots, me and my crew
I won't sign autographs, I'm unfriendly
Up in Long Isl', Rakim, E-P, M-D
B-E, we be, R-U-G, G-E-D, S-T-R, E-E-T
One man gang, whole world vs. me
Blood thirsty, I'll be dead before 30
Born to be a failure, paraphenalia
In my club box, underage chick that love to suck cocks
In the backseat, drivin with no license
Cops followin, runnin down by an idling

[Chorus]
American lowlife, dirtbag, my team
Smelly ?, bad breath, low igene
What do I mean? Smell me, rock my belly
Call my celly up and tell me (Yo, yo, you dirty)
I'm unhealthy
American lowlife
[girl singing:] Dirty, crusty, ass
Lowlife, lowlife
American lowlife
[girl singing:] Your dirty, crusty, ass, lowlife
Dirty, crusty, ass
Your Dirty, crusty, ass, lowlife
