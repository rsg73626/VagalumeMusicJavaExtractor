BREAK DOWN THE WALLS (CHRIS JERICHO THEME)

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Can't save you - nuttin, yeah - you'll see
Uhh - I think they know who we are
You think you know me? Know who we are?
Look at me - I'm lookin at you man
We comin for these kids, yeah

[Chorus x2: R.A. the Rugged Man]

(YEEEEEEEAH!) Break the walls down
Y'all don't want none - break the walls down
(YEEEEEEEAH!) Break the walls down
Y'all don't want none - break the walls down

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Aiyyo.. yeah, yo..
Aiyyo I break down walls, take down walls
Swing baseball bats at you, I hate y'all
If they brawl, we brawl, bring the heat y'all
Bite they face off, I'ma eat y'all, defeat y'all
I'm a wild man, heavy metal hardrocker
Death before dishonor, I gotcha, Rugged Man drop ya
Ain't no peace here, there's beef here
There ain't no man that we fear
You got beef? We be here

[Chorus]

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
The most violent, unstoppable, crazy, crusty
Ugly, my mother doesn't trust me
I walk with a sickness, slash you break you
Take you, throw you on the floor, duct tape you
I'm a monster, bone-crusher, dome-splitter
We throw witcha, you roll thick we roll thicker
Human Rottweiler, rip your ribcage out
We flip out, let the rage out, we insane now
The headbanger, body banger, body breaker
Rhyme wrecker, manslaughter manslayer
Step into the darkness, we sneak through, if we see you
we gon' beat you, this is what we do.. we do..

[Chorus]

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Now who wan' try to take us? (RIGHT NOW)
Now who wan' get beat down? (RIGHT NOW)
Now who wanna step outside? (RIGHT NOW)
Y'all got beef, let's do this (RIGHT NOW)

[Chorus]

[Chorus: fades]
