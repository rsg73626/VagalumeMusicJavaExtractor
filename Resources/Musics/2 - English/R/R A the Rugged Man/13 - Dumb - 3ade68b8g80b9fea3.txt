DUMB

Oh wow, it's me, how you like me now?
Yeah I'm still on the scene, and you don't know how
Blah, blah, blah, blabber, bragger, bold ceremony master, chains snatcher, ??? rapper
Frank Sinatra Ratpacker, not the Rawkus backpacker
I'm back at you like don't they know I'm the wrong dude to fuck with
I'm the dude all the rappers had bad luck with
In fact fuck bad luck, they all hate my guts
Cause they sell more records, but I fuck more sluts
Now let's get off that topic, let's see who the most obnoxious is
Who rocks shit, who got the ??? stoppin
Rap's all time infamous underdog, are you still pissed that I fucked your board?
Are you still pissed that we fucked that whore?
Would you call the cops if I bust your drawers?
Suburban, I get diggey-dumb, the history of rap white boy ???
I get dumb

[Chorus]

Oh yes yes, it's true, I'm back with more shit
Everytime I record shit
It's some get butt-naked fuckin-your-whore-shit
Thought I lost it, cause I signed to a label and got kicked off it?
VH1 will never do my behind the scenes
Cause I'm way too explicit for your TV screens
I'm like "Can we please talk about me a little more? And why I don't sell out 'n I stay hardcore?"
And why I never did a video for TVs, and never bought a beat for more than 3 G's
And never put an album out, not one year
I don't give a fuck about my career
Yeah people talk about me like they know my ass
But where the fuck was you when I had no cash?
Oh wait, I forgot, I still don't got none
Will my album gon' blow up, if I ever drop one?
I'm allergic to worship perfect
You can ??? quicker than ???
Ice Cube, Daddy Kane, Hollywood burnin
Bitch scream when the dick's inserted, remember where you heard it
I get dumb

[Chorus]

Yes yes y'all, y'all know the Rugged Man is the best yo
Top 5 lyricist, no less yo
Funky fresh yo, I be the D-I-double B-S yo
Wonderin where handicapped Rugged Man be at?
They like "Ain't he fell off?
??? he back" ??? for life ??? Diddy ??? word to Mister Cee ??? Biggie
Yeah, that kiddy is real sicky
B-U-B, R-U-G, we like Doug Fresh, Slick Ricky
Bon-stickity-bon-hon, gon' cock-riggedy-run
Ask Das, I get diggety dumb

[Chorus]
