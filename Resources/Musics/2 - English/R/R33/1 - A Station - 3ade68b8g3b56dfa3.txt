A STATION

A station,
 One Heart, Who cries the pain of waiting
 You crying waiting

 Need to see you here with me
 Showing me the right direction to follow
 Until tomorrow ...

 You can even leave without me
 But still I'll be here waiting for you
 Even if all you give up
 I will not quit
 
Today I tried but gave no
 is impossible to forget
 You changed my way of seeing the world
 Do not even breathe without hearing your voice
