NEW FRIENDS

You and I are sisters
Your little mouth whisper
You said you would be there

I have missed you at the club
Used to keep our hands up high
I keep hearing your name
New friends don't feel the same
I have missed you at the club
Used to be forever young
I keep shouting your name
New friends don't feel the same
Your eyes are my lungs and
My body your shelter
We belong together
I hide you inside me
My ribs are your armor
You said I would heal you
You, you, you
I have missed you at the club
Used to keep our hands up high
I keep hearing your name
New friends don't feel the same
I have missed you at the club
Used to be forever young
I keep shouting your name
New friends, new friends don't feel the same!
I have missed you at the club
Used to be forever young
I keep shouting your name
New friends don't feel the same
