SADNESS

I am wounded I am hurt
Life is a machine gun
Feel my darkness overflow

Swallowed by the blue fog
Sadness, you call my name
Sadness is all I have known
Sadness is all I can feel
Sorrow's a river that flows
Sadness is all that is real
Living with a tainted heart
I'am already damaged
Everything will fall apart
Flickering in the flame
Sadness, you call my name
Sadness is all I have known
Sadness is all I can feel
Sorrow's a river that flows
Sadness is all that is real
Sadness is all I have known
Sadness is all I can feel
Sorrow's a river that flows
Sadness is all that is real
