HANG US HIGH

Don't go out alone now
Through the broken gateway
There is nothing for us

I will not feed the silence

Always keep your head up
When you cross the border
Learn to love the darkness
I will not feed the silence

Pre
Shiver and shake
They can't take my heart away
Break your ball and chain

They are gonna hang us high
They are gonna hang us high
They are gonna hang us high
They are gonna hang us high

V2
Wear it like your necklace
I'll embrace the shock wave
Learn to love the darkness
I will not feed the silence

Can you hear my heart drum
As I shine like diamonds
There is nothing left now
I will not feed the silence
