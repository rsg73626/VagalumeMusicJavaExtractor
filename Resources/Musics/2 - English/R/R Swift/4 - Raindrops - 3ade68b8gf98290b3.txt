RAINDROPS

[Verse 1: Martymar]
Okay we always been the underdog
Nobody ever wanted me
Now rappers go to shows, track us down
and try to talk to me
Got a bunch of misfit kids who love us and they follow me
We don't follow rules we break 'em and it doesn't bother me
Misfits on my chest, feel like we the best
But that's just how it goes, Social Club until my death
And this is how I do it, never thought that I would be here
Gotta have a couple of enemies or else it would be weird
Yeah
Now I start to see clear
Lost a couple of friends that I love just to be here
That's just how it goes, I'm never picking up my phone
And people try to hang-out once they find out
that you're home
I only trust a few but I'm usually alone
But don't feel bad for me it's like this way all along
And some things never change I'm always living in the rain
The only time I feel alive is when I feel the pain
Somethings wrong with me

[Hook]
Raindrops keep falling from my head, ah yeah
I'll tell you everything you wanna know, baby baby
And things be getting kinda crazy, lately
And I've been feeling like it's all gonna turn around
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
And one day this is all gonna work somehow

[Verse 2: R-swift]
Yeah
Chasing dreams as I grew up
Was told I would fail, I was seen as a screw up
While they fixating on my maneuvers
I'd be a fool if I let opinions dictate my future
My image couldn't cut it, a underdog in they eyes
Six albums later they wondered how I survived
And hell-minded in an industry so shaky
But want didn't create me, couldn't break me
I was told
Drink the formula and watch them line up
But I wind up giving em me as opposed to a product
Not for sale
While they tell me not being myself
is the only way that I will prevail
False
Cause the truth is I'm never far away from
My foundation, reminding me where I came from
Revolutionary at the least my burdens heavy
these verses are King speech
Man's whispers don't affect me
I Got Em

[Hook]
Raindrops keep falling from my head, oh yeah
I'll tell you everything you wanna know, baby baby
And things be getting kinda crazy, lately
And I've been feeling like it's all gonna turn around
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
And once day this is all gonna work somehow

[Verse 3: Fern]
Yeah
Ask mickey if I ain predict this record
Flavor Fest 0'12 set the tone for this session
Rhyme council Social Club no intermission
No breaks no days off, you get the picture
Now open up your Word brother get some scripture
I steer you right now that I have your attention
They like Social Club we hearda dem
And Swift is the big homie
We turned around and learn from him
Yeah
This here is big like Chris Wallace
Uh, if you think we in it for thick wallets
Guess again suckers the Lord says He get all this
Marty's my ace I make a call to the bullpen
Putting out fires spitting flows from the pulpit
And can't ban this like assault weapons and full clips
Uh, Social Club is here and we're never leaving
And to You, Lord, I'm pledging my forever allegiance

[Hook]
Raindrops keep falling from my head, oh yeah
I'll tell you everything you wanna know, baby baby
And things be getting kinda crazy, lately
And I've been feeling like it's all gonna turn around
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
We gonna make, aw yeah yeah
And once day this is all gonna work somehow
