EVERYDAY ALL DAY CYPHA

[verse 1: mac the doulos]
I'm tryin' to push a different propaganda
In an industry where the most high god is slandered
Where jesus is a joke
Cats don't take him seriously
that's ironic when jesus ya only hope
And he says "you can't get to god without me"
To squash yall beef and I ain't talkin' 'bout cow meat
Nope, you could taste jehovah's grace
And I ain't lyin to you kid, this ain't no poker face
Naw, I admit, I'm tryin' to sabotage the system
Drop a few albums to grab yall attention
And switch them affections
From the vanities of life to the death
burial, and resurrection

[verse 2: lecrae]
Hold up! I ain't just come to see y'all move
After the track's done I hope to see y'all moved
Aye yo, I used to live in sin, as you can see I moved
Now I abide to christ jesus cuz he that dude
Yes, without him I'm dummy
So where ever he go I go like my buddy
Uh huh, and it's an everyday process
Beatin' up my flesh like I'm tryna win a contest

[verse 3: the ambassador]
I happen to rap for a master who's rap is just
Classic in fact he's got raps that's miraculous
He can just speak and it has to just happen its
Jesus who spat and this life was just as it is
As for this blasphemous world I go after it
Rap is my craft, it's universal like catholic
After this rappin biz I still will go after this
World but my rap will be rapped through the pastorate
Praise god that when adam bit the dust
The last adam dipped into the pit and got us out of it
That's the trick, the cross let us bask in it
Want another way?
you get none like when you're abstinent

[verse 4: flame]
House hold of faith god's gotcha
When the son fulfilled the psalms and died at golgotha
Now we got that agape love
That tough to love me enough just to stop me love
You gotsta love the one we call the rock of ages
Or the ancient of days
Or yeshua... yes you are
One day gonna confess the lord
Or take his rod or god's gonna mess you up
Meaning wrath
God plus wicked men you do the math
Criminals convicted of their wickedness
Yo god is screaming come seek me
Mungu akubariki
That's god bless you in swahili

[verse 5: phanatik]
Take it easy
You're listening to the ep of ep
Don't try to fight the power fan
You're not p easy
We ain't gotta come to your hood
And talk greasy
Actin' all grizzly
That's the walt disney
You're over-animated and oh so candy painted
It's false
You're blinding my eyes with all that gloss
But the cross that you're flossing
in needs to be flossing you
But god put his son on the cross
Took sinners and crossed the two
And that's all inclusive
For all of us that all move in the sphere of the spirit
Who causes all to groove in
The process is really legit
Cause you could be an unbelieving hypocrite
And still be feeling this hit
It's time to switch
For my brothers and me
I rep the cm
So let me introduce you to another mc

[verse 6: r-swift]
We got our feet to the faith
And a heart for the streets
So it's the muscle we could mate 'er
Told harder the beat
We were dead as a corpse
Heading to the scorts
Cause he heading to the cross
We stand resurrected in the lord
And woken up out of a deep sleep
And as long as he's the chief
There's not a block out of our reach
No fam I ain't trying to be deep
But he's the ram in a bush
He died so you and I could be free

[verse 7: iz-real]
Listen I know most seen the passion of christ
But I'm concerned
cause we rarely see a passion for christ
The worlds a matrix people passing thru life
Chasing they favorites
but jesus ain't the star in their sights
Nope won't compromise I'm tryin' to move the cross
Everyday I'm hustlin' dirty but I ain't rick ross
Cut from a different cloth
Boss we gotta reach the lost make it business
give 'em the gospel early at all cost
