AWESOME GOD

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God

All power he contains it, the man on his own
Abandoned the throne to approach the cross stainless
Death couldn't shake him or derail
Three nails could pierce
but couldn't break him or make him appear taken
Away from his mere nature, not

While slumber is hovering over the block
I pray that my peers wake up
We were born out of alignment, the perfect timing is now
To check for a pulse if you ain't rocked by him
I am prone to be biased
when I peep the timeline behind him
And see no highness as high as him
He reigns Lord, firearms are too short to aim for him
Call him extremist, he leaks Katrinas
when he's brainstorming
that's quite enormous, to say the least our God is a beast
His wrath is the sound of a lion roaring
Since he's topped by none
I'm on hip-hop's frontline screaming
from the top of my lungs?

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God

All glory he demands it, all pale in comparison
He holds the scales that you can't tip off
'cause he can't slip off, so I stand unanimous
With no hiatus my heart is bearing his manuscripts
Our bars bare him

While the world swears by its barbarics, we declare him
Fist clinching the thin air for him
won't fold when it comes to making men aware of him
(breathe)
he's exactly what we could never be
Born no identity sin embedded in our pedigree
he could have let us be
But saved us and set us free

Redeemed from the chokehold of sin's destruction
serve no one but him only
Spit so you comprehend
but in the end these words serve him no justice
Nothing exists without his signature to allow it
Lord of the ring 'cause all creation revolves around him
The I am more than a legend and some
So we boast in the Lord through these anthems and sing

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God
