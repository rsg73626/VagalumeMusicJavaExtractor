33 W. CEMETERY STREET

There's this addiction deep inside
to follow lust as it comes
you know safety doesn't come from hiding
it comes from when you run
You'll run away 
to start a game of Hide and Seek 
but she'll take a breath to rest at 
the Cemetery's Street 

From behind me I will watch him 
falling down 
and from beside me I will watch her 
dig holes into the ground
he's running away 
she's digging graves for memories
lay them to rest with this forgotten sanity

For a moment now he think
that he's got it all planned out 
but she'll surprise him with a question
she's got him all figured out 
see, that would be the time 
that he had planned to run away 
but now he'll hide behind excuses 
she's not enough for him to stay

From behind me I will watch him 
falling down 
and from beside me I will watch her 
dig holes into the ground
he's running away 
she's digging graves for memories
lay them to rest with this forgotten sanity

She'll run away to dig a grave 
for you to fall into

Just look at the headstones
that line this street 
this is the place
to put your pain at ease 
She'll walk on the gravel 
to pack it in deep 
now may these memories
rest in peace.
