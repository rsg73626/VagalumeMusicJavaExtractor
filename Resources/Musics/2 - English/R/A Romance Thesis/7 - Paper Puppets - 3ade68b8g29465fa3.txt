PAPER PUPPETS

You just watch and see
I'm making this all happen just for me

So don't talk, just stop, and take a second 
please hold your tongue this time
'cause I really have no need to know
the plans you have in mind
don't you dare speak a word you're thinking
I can't handle you tonight 
for once I'd like to just pretend 
that everythings just fine 

we'll live a life like paper puppets 
just to rip it all to shreds

You gave me everything I've ever needed
I'm giving back to you 
for every little obsticle 
that you tried to help me though 
You see, I'm not afraid of failing
and I'm learning as I go 
and I'm not ashamed to say that
this is all I've ever known

I've been attached to the strings you're pulling
a marrionette at best 
forgive me for not wanting to be 
exactly like the rest 
you see the curtains swinging open 
and I'm hanging by a thread
and I'm better off being cut loose
than falling to my death 

we'll live a life like paper puppets 
just to rip it all to shreds

You gave me everything I've ever needed
I'm giving back to you 
for every little obsticle 
that you tried to help me though 
You see, I'm not afraid of failing
and I'm learning as I go 
and I'm not ashamed to say that
this is all I've ever known
