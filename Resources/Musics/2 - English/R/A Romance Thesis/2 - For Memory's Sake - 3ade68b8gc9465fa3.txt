FOR MEMORY'S SAKE

For memory's sake
stop pretending like you want to forget 

So take my hand, I'll walk you down 
that road you walked ten times before
but this time I will show you 
I'll show you what you're walking for 

For memory's sake 
stop pretending like you want to forget 
just give it up 
cause you know that there 
there's still something left
I'll blink my eyes
and this will all be a dream 
you'll blink your eyes 
and then proceed to the fantasy 

and hold your breath 
for just this moment
there's one moment left
and hold your breath
for just this moment
it's all that we have left

For memory's sake 
stop pretending like you want to forget 
just give it up 
cause you know that there 
there's still something left
I'll blink my eyes
and this will all be a dream 
you'll blink your eyes 
and then proceed to the fantasy

I will show you exactly what you want to see

For memory's sake 
stop pretending like you want to forget 
just give it up 
cause you know that there 
there's still something left
I'll blink my eyes
and this will all be a dream 
you'll blink your eyes 
and then proceed to the fantasy
