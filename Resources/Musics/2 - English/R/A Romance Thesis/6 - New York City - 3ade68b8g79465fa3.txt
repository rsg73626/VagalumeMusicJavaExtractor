NEW YORK CITY

I've never felt so close to home 
being so far away 
and I really dont mind you leaving me here
alone to find my way 
I walk through the city of lights
where the people never sleep 
and I find myself 86 floors up
and I finally feel complete

You never gave that to me so... 

Leave me in this city 
leave me here to die alone 
I'll work for every little thing 
that I dare to call my own 
and throw me in a taxi 
walk away but leave that smile 
I'll stand on these two feet 
and I'll fight alone for a while 

Looking back on everything 
that was never really home
I've never seen an honest truth 
in what you all have shown
the streets are all the same 
there's nothing new to make me try 
but the city that seems so fake, is real
and it's keeping me alive

you never gave that to me, no 
you never showed me how... so...

Leave me in this city 
leave me here to die alone 
I'll work for every little thing 
that I dare to call my own 
and throw me in a taxi 
walk away but leave that smile 
I'll stand on these two feet 
and I'll fight alone for a while 

I'll fight for a while..
you'll understand what I have left behind
and you will see... 
I'm getting by alright 
I'm just fine!

So, Leave me in this city 
leave me here to die alone 
I'll work for every little thing 
that I dare to call my own 
and throw me in a taxi 
walk away but leave that smile 
I'll stand on these two feet 
and I'll fight alone for a while
