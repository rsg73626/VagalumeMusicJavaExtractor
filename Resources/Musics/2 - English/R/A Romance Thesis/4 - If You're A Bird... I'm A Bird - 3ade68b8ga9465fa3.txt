IF YOU'RE A BIRD... I'M A BIRD

I don't know what you're thinking tonight 
But there's a sea of freedom below you 
and your thought just might be to take flight 
but there's one last thing that I owe you 
I owe you this... 

Now, be sure to say goodbye 
and write my name in your pocket 
so when you're found, they can tell me you're safe 
though safety might mean that 
you went home to meet your maker 
at least you've found a little bit of peace 
that's all you've ever wanted 
was a way to escape 
to run away from all your demons 
and outwit the curse of hate 
but you have lost once again 
you think you're stuck with this plan 
and that flight would be the only way 
to prove that you're a man... 
but its not... 

I don't know what you're thinking tonight 
But there's a sea of freedom below you 
and your thought just might be to take flight 
but there's one last thing that I owe you 
I owe you this... 

See, why he chose the bridge 
I guess I'll never really know 
but I think that he just wanted to fly 
before he had to go 
one time was all he needed 
one last chance to be a bird 
just to fall to his fate 
to cease this never ending hurt 
It's been growing with time 
and he's been taken to the edge 
now his arms are outstretched 
and he will fly from this ledge 
and I will watch him fly 
with my very own eyes 
God, He looks just like a bird 
It's such a beautiful disguise... 

I don't know what you're thinking tonight 
But there's a sea of freedom below you 
and your thought just might be to take flight 
but there's one last thing that I owe you 
I owe you this... 

one last chance to live... 
cause a bird is not such a great 
creature to be 
one wrong move of the wind 
and you get swept into the sea 

But I refuse to watch you fall 
I refuse to watch you break 
I'll continue holding on 
for as long as it takes 
I'm not ready for goodbye 
I'm not ready to part ways 
I'm not ready to let go 
or watch you fall to this fate 
So just kiss me on the lips 
I'll breathe my life into you 
If thats what it takes... 
then thats what I must do 
But I guess I'm too late 
It's not my life to save 
I've done all I can do 
Now it's your step to take 

But, I don't know what you're thinking tonight 
there's a sea of freedom below you 
and your thought just might be to take flight 
but there's one last thing that I owe you 
Cause I know what you're thinking tonight 
there's a sea of freedom below you 
and the act has become taking flight 
but theres one last thing that I owe you... 
I owe you this... 
one last chance to live... 
with "goodbye" on my lips.
