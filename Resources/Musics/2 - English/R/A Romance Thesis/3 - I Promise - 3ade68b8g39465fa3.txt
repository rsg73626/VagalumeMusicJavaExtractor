I PROMISE

I'm giving up on all of these excuses
I'm running away and feeling pretty useless
I'm hiding behind what hasn't been changed
My puzzle needs to rearrange

We could fall apart with one mistake
reality just doesn't matter when everything's this fake
and we could hold on tight for another day
or live with this regret and know
that "I Promise" was all we had to say

I'm giving up on all of these excuses
I'm running away and feeling pretty useless
I'm hiding behind what hasn't been changed
My puzzle needs to rearrange

I have found myself alone to fake a dream
I'm frightened so I hold on tight to fabricated things
for I am all alone and you ran away
without a second thought because
"I Promise" is what you forgot to say

I'm giving up on all of these excuses
I'm running away and feeling pretty useless
I'm hiding behind what hasn't been changed
My puzzle needs to rearrange

So lets not fall apart with one mistake
reality is all that matters cause this is nothing fake
and lets just hold on tight for another day
and live without regret because
"I Promise" is all that I say

I'm giving up on all of these excuses
I'm running away and feeling pretty useless
I'm hiding behind what hasn't been changed
My puzzle needs to rearrange

Cause I Promise.
