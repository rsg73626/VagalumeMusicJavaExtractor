PLANS

I didn't listen when you told me 
that everything was gonna be alright 
I didn't listen when you told me 
that the time had come to say goodnight 
I wanted to hold onto this a little longer
just hold onto me a little longer 
So take my hand and walk with me 
I'm not letting you go
I'm not setting you free
anytime soon. 

This isn't how it's suppose to end 
we've only created just the begining 
this isn't how it's suppose to be
this isn't the reason I'm living
we were going to be a miracle
the plans we had could have changed the world
I never saw any changes... 
was it even worth it? 

You didn't listen when I told you 
the way I felt was being pushed aside
you didn't listen when I told you 
that there was nothing left for me to hide
you wanted to let go of this a little sooner 
just let me slip away a little quicker 
detach these hands of fingers laced
just turn away, forget my face...
and continue on. 

This isn't how it's suppose to end 
we've only created just the begining 
this isn't how it's suppose to be
this isn't the reason I'm living
we were going to be a miracle
the plans we had could have changed the world
I never saw any changes... 
was it even worth it?
