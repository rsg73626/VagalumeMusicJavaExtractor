THIS SIMPLE PLEA

I will watch it all fall 
and I will hear the sorry crash 
when the moon with the stars 
let go to see the everlast 
and so desperate is his wanting
for a pulse or single beat 
as his lonely laughter echoed 
in the silence of the street 

She reached out with hope in hand 
her simple plea tonight 
gather up the courage 
using every ample bit of might 
he's living for disgust 
and fallen fathers of this past 
dreaming up a nightmare
where each frightful second is made to last

I watched him tremple 
I watched his hands shake
I watched his eyes close
and I watched his pulse break
and I heard the voices 
that torment his nights
sleepless he lies and lonely he fights

She reached out with hope in hand 
her simple plea tonight 
gather up the courage 
using every ample bit of might 
he's living for disgust 
and fallen fathers of this past 
dreaming up a nightmare
where each frightful second is made to last

So, He stopped and opened his eyes 
she stood with arms open wide 
he took her hand tonight 
to make this hurt feel alright
Let go, hold on 
this won't take long
I will save you 
So listen without another question

She reached out with hope in hand 
her simple plea tonight 
gather up the courage 
using every ample bit of might 
he's living for disgust 
and fallen fathers of this past 
dreaming up a nightmare
where each frightful second is made to last

Let go! Hold on! 
this won't take long 
I will save you 
If you'd let me.
