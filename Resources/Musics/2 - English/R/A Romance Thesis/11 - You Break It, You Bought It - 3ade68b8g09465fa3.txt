YOU BREAK IT, YOU BOUGHT IT

So follow me into the dark 
let me remind you of just who you are
and all the things that you should be 
'cause that's exactly what you did to me. 
I should tell you what it feels like 
to be the one alone at night 
but I'll just smile at the door 
and say that you got what you paid for. 

But this isn't what you wanted
this isn't what you planned 
you've taken everything away from me 
for someone else's hand 
and this isn't what you wanted 
this isn't what you need 
I've given everything away
so go ahead and take what's left of me. 

Now, Follow me into the light
maybe then you'll see this isn't right 
she's not the girl you saw in me 
or even ever hoped that I could be 
you'll never get the dream that you hoped for 
you gave it to me when you walked out the door
I held in the palm of my hand 
while begging you to reconsider your plan 

But this isn't what you wanted
this isn't what you planned 
you've taken everything away from me 
for someone else's hand 
and this isn't what you wanted 
this isn't what you need 
I've given everything away
so go ahead and take what's left of me

Wait, Give it back! 
You don't deserve what I've given away. 
Wait, Give it back. 
You Don't deserve this.
