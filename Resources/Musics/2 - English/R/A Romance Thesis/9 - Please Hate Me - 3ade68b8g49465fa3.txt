PLEASE HATE ME

See me, I am so guilty 
of all those things that you blamed on me 
and I will walk through fire 
just to once again be considered a liar
but oh you, you just wait and see
just look what you've done to me

'Cause I've never been one to just walk away 
but you're pushing me further with everyday 
and I don't want this to ruin me 
So, I'll walk away faster than ever before
I'll say all the things I couldn't say before
and I'll make sure this time you hate me

And you, you are so innocent 
and you, you think you're heaven sent 
cause you will walk on water 
just to show me how, show me how I falter
but oh you, you just wait and see
and just look what you've done to me 

'Cause I've never been one to just walk away 
but you're pushing me further with everyday 
and I don't want this to ruin me 
So, I'll walk away faster than ever before
I'll say all the things I couldn't say before
and I'll make sure this time you hate me

See, all I want is for you to hate me 
maybe that will make this a little easy 
oh please, hate me
so I can let you go. 
but oh you, you just wait and see 
and just look what you've done to me

'Cause I've never been one to just walk away 
but you're pushing me further with everyday 
and I don't want this to ruin me 
So, I'll walk away faster than ever before
I'll say all the things I couldn't say before
and I'll make sure this time you hate me
