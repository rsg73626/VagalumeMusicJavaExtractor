LETTING GOOD THINGS GO

It's simple but I didnt get it 
it's easy but I couldn't see
we both just seem to find ourselves
blinded by insecurity
but who's to blame when we're both at fault
too proud to admit defeat 
the minutes take the pain away 
but we're left with this still incomplete

So break it down a little slower now 
comprehension could be near
maybe we could see this clear
but for now, I'll let a good thing go 
I'll take whatever chance it takes
there's no more room for these mistakes 

it's simple but I didn't get it 
it's easy but you couldnt see
we both just seem to find ourselves 
blinded by insecurity 
'cause I have seen the perfect dream 
shattered right in front of me 
a simple silence given up 
so when you wake goodbye
I'll wish myself goodluck. 

So break it down a little slower now 
comprehension could be near

I'll take whatever chance it takes
there's no more room for these mistake

I learned my lesson long ago
You never let a good thing go.
