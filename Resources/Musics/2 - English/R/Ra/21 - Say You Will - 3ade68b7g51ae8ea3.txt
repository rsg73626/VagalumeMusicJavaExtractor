SAY YOU WILL

My eyes are closed
Within my mind I still can feel your skin
Those memories seem so faint so thin
You don't believe
You close the door and never took the time
You never once could let me in

All the time
All the pain
Torn apart too far to see my way
I can't live without you mine

Say you will
Say you will
Shine on me for one more day
Say you will
Just say you will
Love what you betray

It's all a lie
We shouldn't be ashamed to live out loud
To suffocate in doubt
You have to set me free
It's you I can't escape the things you did to me
It's all that I can see

All the time
All the pain
Torn apart too far to see my way
I can't live without you mine

Say you will
Say you will
Shine on me for one more day
Say you will
Just say you will
Love what you betray
Just say you will
Say you will
Shine on me for one more day
Say you will
Just say you will
Say you will

Is it me
Is it me
Am I not what you expected me to be
Did I fall
Lose it all
Did you think I'd let you do that to me
You can try
You can cry
But it won't erase what has happened to me
I can't live
I can't give 
I can't say I will I will I will
I will
