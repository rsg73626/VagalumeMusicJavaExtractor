SUPERNOVA

And now I close the door
Melding a resurrection
Living through every war
I underscore the pain
Windows of fantasy
shadows of expectations
drowning in agony
I set this body free

It always happens right before it's over
You light the sky up like a supernova

I believe the writings on the wall
I don't regret at all
I never played the game
Part of me will always see the sun
as if it just begun
to be the only one
who knew what I became

Walking the way I see
gateways in all directions
magical empathy
the wind it knocks me down
lost in a neutron star
ready to break a cycle
it never heals, it's gone
the moment tears in me

It always happens right before it's over
You light the sky up like a supernova

I believe the writings on the wall
I don't regret at all
I never played the game
Part of me will always see the sun
as if it just begun
to be the only one
who knew what I became

(Spoken) The ticking moments beats against me
like broken waves in a desert
Lolling envy cascades beneath a yellow sky
dying slowly in a casket of infinite density
Aiming too high the arrow misses
and makes its mark on a setting sun
Reaching up, there is no one
but the echoes of potential that rattle and bang against
what could have been
Having regret, we find the ego
wanting more, needing more
The frozen walls melting into the childish night
The time has come to open our eyes
and be blinded by the sun. (Spoken)

It always happens right before it's over
You light the sky up like a supernova

I believe the writings on the wall
I don't regret at all
I never played the game
Part of me will always see the sun
as if it just begun
to be the only one
who knew what I became
