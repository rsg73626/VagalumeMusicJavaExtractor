THE ONLY ONE

You think I notice that you're standing there right next to me
Am I supposed to bow my head and thank you gratefully
You break my heart and turn around to get what still remains
I sold my soul and bought my fear, my inner pain
Without a clue I trust I follow you with my eyes blind
And what I cannot see I need I cannot leave behind
With all those eyes on me, their hunger is insanity
I can see you standing there, do you wanna be free do you wanna be me

I don't wanna be the only one
To see my name wrote up on the sun
I don't wanna be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea
I don't wanna have to play the game
To sell my soul, betray my name
I don't wanna be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea

So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Those words are mine
And you can find them deep inside of me
You walk away
Some how dismayed at what you may have done
The lies, the dreams, the broken promises, the only one
I can't remember whose I dea it was to make this real
Divided equally my feelings I still cannot feel
And there you are you're all alone inside your fantasy 
I can see you standing there,
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be me

I don't wanna be the only one
To see my name wrote up on the sun
I don't wanna be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea
I don't wanna have to play the game
To sell my soul, betray my name
I don't wanna be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea

And when the light is gone and it's just you and me
Will you allow us to be who we're supposed to be
Or will time erode our thoughts, our will, insanity

I don't wanna be the only one
To see my name wrote up on the sun
I don't wanna be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea
I don't wanna have to play the game
To sell my soul, betray my name
I don't wanna be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea

I don't wanna be the only one (x4)
To watch it fall into the sea
