GOT ME GOING

I can't get you out of my head
You said things that should never be said

Everything I know
Doesn't matter cause I might as well be dumb
Everything I do
Couldn't help me
Cause nothing in this world will stop me

You took me over the moment you walked in the room
I lose my mind every time I see you coming
Should I give in this time although I don't know how
You got me going now
You got me going now

Why didn't I just walk away
You and I we should never play

Everything I know
Doesn't matter cause I might as well be dumb
Everything I do
Couldn't help me
Cause nothing in this world will stop me

You took me over the moment you walked in the room
I lose my mind every time I see you coming
Should I give in this time although I don't know how
You got me going now
You got me going now

I'm gonna take you all the way
Electrify the life you're leading
I'm gonna take you all the way
And make you one with me

You took me over the moment you walked in the room
I lose my mind every time I see you coming
Should I give in this time although I don't know how
You got me going now
You got me going now
You got me going now (x8)
