END OF DAYS

The sun goes down and once again you close your eyes to go to sleep. 
So far of just your hopes run high. 
You start to dream in black and grey, 
You start to speak but know not what you say 
Your stars begin to fall out from the sky. 

And so you try to turn alone 
The fear in your heart makes you understand that time's running out 
he's had enough there's no reason, so say your prayers 

I dont wanna live in a prison I dont wanna die in vain this will be the last inquisition I won't be a slave at the end of days...the end of days 

Defeat of a hole within one mind 
The force of will is only so 
The battle fought within his mind 
A wild search Apprommel Learch(no idea with that one) a tempting voice of anarchy 
He's unaware of who he finds 

And so he tries to turn alone 
the fear in his heart makes him understand time's running out 
he's had enough there's no reasons to say your prayers 

I dont wanna live in a prison I dont wanna die in vain this will be the last inquisition I won't be a slave at the end of days 

The sky turns red as blood 
Stars fall from the sky 
Children run and they try to hide but there's no where to go so we're all gonna DIE! 

The battle's won 
The battle's lost 
Blood runs across his hands 
He kneels and slowly bows his head 

And so we try to turn alone 
The fear in our heart makes us understand time's running out 
He's had enough and there's no reason to say your prayers 

I dont wanna live in a prison I dont wanna die in vain this will be the last inquisition I won't be a slave at the end of... 

I dont wanna live in a prison I dont wanna die in vain this will be the last inquisition I won't be a slave...at the end of days
