RECTIFIER

I'm still afraid of ghosts that can see me
They know my thoughts, they read my mind
Beside myself I judge my condition
I close my eyes but can't go blind
I'm feeling all the heat, all the chaos
It's gotten underneath my skin
So far to go to reach absolution
My sanity, my soul runs thin

Why don't you care?
Don't, don't you dare

Rectifier, how's the world supposed to be?
Rectifier, take my hand and rescue me

I fell in love, I made that decision
On broken hearts I cut myself
Despite the pain I maintain my position
And leave good will up on the shelf
But now I'm stuck... a chain with no linkage
A vagrant lover prisoner
Suspicious goals distort good intentions
Aggressive action batterer

Why don't you care?
Don't, don't you dare
Rectifier, how's the world supposed to be?
Rectifier, take my hand and rescue me
Rectifier, how's the world supposed to be?
Rectifier, take my hand and set me free! (2x)
