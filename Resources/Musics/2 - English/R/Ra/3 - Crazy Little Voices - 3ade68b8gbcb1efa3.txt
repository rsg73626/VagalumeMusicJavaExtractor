CRAZY LITTLE VOICES

Time is not a friend of mine
It forces me to wait
For symbols of reality and scriptures of my fate
I can hear the laughter now, the universal joke
That must be insecurity, absurdity I spoke

Walk with me my children (walk with me my children)
Walk into the sea (walk into the sea)
Those crazy little voices (crazy little voices)
Talk to me and say…they say

Bring me the gun, the gun
Bring me the gun, the gun

Done you say, but why the gun?
Is it too dark to see?
The mental pause of fearful thoughts
And dark insanity
Keep in mind and not in heart
For dealing can be trick
What little hope you demonstrate
As opposed to what you say

Walk with me my children (walk with me my children)
Walk into the sea (walk into the sea)
I can give no reason for you to follow me (you to follow me)
I come without conscience (I come without conscience)
And I don't doubt a need (I don't doubt a need)
Those crazy little voices (crazy little voices)
Talk to me and say…they say

Bring me the gun, the gun (x5)
