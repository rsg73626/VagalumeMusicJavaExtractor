TAKE ME AWAY

Inside a second you can hear a flower growing in the
wind
But does it reach you when there's darkness all
around
How many days will this go on
How many thoughts can I obsess
Why do we come apart
And watch it all go down

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

I see it shining on the sun
A road that leads beyond this place
A way to push aside the walls that block our path
If time can truly be a lie
There's nothing left but you and I
Denying everything and shattering the glass

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

Out of mind out of time
All alone stuck at home
Can't decide Full of pride
I want it all
Left to be only me
Far away everyday
Sanity Vanity
I want it all

Symbolize separation
Let me be set me free

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

Take me away (x4)
