TAKEN

It's always been the way that it has been
Falling through a hole inside myself
I can't remember hardly anything
But I remember holding your hand
In winter colors all but fade away
The sun seems more ashamed to take the sky
You used to keep me warm within your purity
But now I am lost in an empty space oh

Healing, a broken soul, this lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken, now that you've been ripped from me

My memory is a fog too thick to see
I must have sold your thoughts to stop the pain
And while it always rains inside of me
My love for you will never ever let you die oh

Healing, this broken soul, this lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken, now that you've been ripped from me

Can't you see
Can't you see
I'm not me

I can't let go your softness haunts me
Without your touch I wrinkle like a flower burned
If there's a god I promise him anything he asks of me
So I could hold you in my arms forever

Healing, this broken soul, this lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken, now that you've been ripped from me oh
Healing, this broken soul, this lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken, now that you've been ripped from me
