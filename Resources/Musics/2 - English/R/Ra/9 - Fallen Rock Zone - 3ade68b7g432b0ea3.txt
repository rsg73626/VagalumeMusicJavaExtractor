FALLEN ROCK ZONE

Who do you see... standing behind you
Your shadow's me, and you are mine
What do you want you sick fucking pervert
I'll hunt you down for all of time

A fallen rock zone
A broken back bone
I want to hear you scream into your cell phone
You're just a traitor, eleventh grader
A cyber sex addicted masturbator

Cowardly punk, you make me nauseous
Misguided fool, you have no balls
stalking young girls, preying on weakness
Bent on a life with bars for walls

A fallen rock zone
A broken back bone/STEALING MY TONE (is said on second time)
I want to hear you scream into your cell phone
You're just a traitor, eleventh grader
A cyber sex addicted masturbator (2x)

Yeah we've all seen it before, you see how people hunt and prey on women
The next time you see a guy put his hands on a girl and she don't want
Him to put his hands on her, you tell that guy he's a punk, you tell him
He's a fuckin punk!

A fallen rock zone
A broken back bone/STEALING MY TONE (is said on second and fourth time)
I want to hear you scream into your cell phone
You're just a traitor, eleventh grader
