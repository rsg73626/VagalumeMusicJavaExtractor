AWAKE

Rain and everything washed away
The rivers rushing over
All the scattered parts inside of me
And if I could restart the day
The wind would push you
Closer to the edge
Than you would want to be

I won't be lost without you
No more mistakes that I can make

I'm awake
I'm awake now
And the sky is falling down
Broken glass is all around
I'm awake
I'm awake now
No more hiding in the lies
All my inhibitions die
I'm awake

Hope
It isn't worth the wait
When everything I hate
Tries to pin me to the wall again
With all the question and confusion
There's no way to make amends
So angry memories
Divide me up in two again

I won't be lost without you
No more of this that I can take

I'm awake
I'm awake now
And the sky is falling down
Broken glass is all around
I'm awake
I'm awake now
No I'm not afraid to run
My corruption is undone

There's nothing that can hold me down
The lights have finally broken free
Outside this door the sun shines
Brighter than I ever could've dreamed

I'm awake
I'm awake
And I've given you as much as I can let you take
I'm awake
I'm awake
So the game is over now
And the rest is up to fate

I'm awake
I'm awake now
And the sky is falling down
Broken glass is all around
I'm awake
I'm awake now
No more hiding in the lies
All my inhibitions die

I'm awake
I'm awake now
No I'm not afraid to run
My ambition is undone
I'm awake
I'm awake now
And the sky is falling down
Broken glass is all around
I'm awake
