SWIMMING UPSTREAM

The sun disappeared right before my eyes
My heart turned and walked away
I gave you the keys to an open door
And you threw them right back at me
Once again I'm alone with a pain in my chest
So sad, so sad, so alone
The clouds start to gather, here comes the rain
You meant more than you could know

I can't say I miss you
You're always around
I can't say I love you
'Cause you'll cut me down
I'm wounded and hurt
And that's my fault
But I made my decision with my back to the wall
And I gotta move on from here
I've done all that I can do
Yeah I gotta move on from here
I've been swimming upstream for you

As time passes by, I can't explain
It's hard to be next to you
Is it my face or is it everything
That you're not attracted to?
I'm so lost and confused when I look at you
Your eyes, your lips, so soft
And then when you see me, I turn away
'Cause I know that I turn you off

I can't say I miss you
You're always around
I can't say I love you
'Cause you'll cut me down
I'm wounded and hurt
And that's my fault
But I made my decision with my back to the wall
And I gotta move on from here
I've done all that I can do
Yeah I gotta move on from here
I've been swimming upstream for you
I've been swimming upstream for you
I've been swimming upstream for you
Yeah, I've been swimming upstream for you
I've been swimming upstream for you
