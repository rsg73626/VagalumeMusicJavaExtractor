I LOST EVERYTHING TODAY

I'm running out of excuses now
I try to hide from what you're giving
Cold advice never seems to end
Training days that I was living
Magic makes for a boring lie
Golden shit and a red bowtie
Bleeding hearts disregard the sun
And what's begun I don't know why

I lost everything today
I got beaten so I ran away
I lost everything today
I can't find my way to yesterday

Graveyard shifts to sleepless nights
Comatose but I'm still kickin'
Hungry headed data pig
God's remorse the paces quicken
Fundamental decadence
Simplified the masses wonder
Faulty streams of conciousness
The sea of crap that we live under

I lost everything today
Out of time and it is not worth trying
I lost everything today
Lost it all and I feel like dying

I lost everything today
I got beaten so I ran away
I lost everything today
I can't find my way to yesterday
I lost everything today
Out of time and it is not worth trying
I lost everything today
Lost it all and I feel like dying
