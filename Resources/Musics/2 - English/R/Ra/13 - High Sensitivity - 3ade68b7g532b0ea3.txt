HIGH SENSITIVITY

I feel like I'm old
I feel like an invalid
I feel like I'm sick
In a casket so close the lid

I feel like I'm done
I feel like it's over now
I feel but I'm numb
Curtain falls while I take a bow and now

Substance races through my veins
Angels try to soothe my pain

High sensitivity
Wake up with my head still aching
High sensitivity
I'm drugged from all the pills I'm taking

I don't know my name
I don't know if I can make it
I don't feel the same
My brain is dead and I cannot wake it
I don't wanna run
I don't have a place to run to
I don't see the sun
I don't understand what I must do

Substance races through my veins
Angels try to soothe my pain

High sensitivity
I wake up with my head still aching
High sensitivity
I'm drugged from all the pills I'm taking
High sensitivity
I laugh, my self respect is flaking
High sensitivity
I hate all the mistakes I'm making

My money's running out
My shoes are wearing thin
Each day I break my back
To end where I begin
A razor full of blood is dragged across the sky
But I don't think I really want to die

High sensitivity
I wake up with my head still aching
High sensitivity
I'm drugged from all the pills I'm taking
High sensitivity
I laugh, my self respect is flaking
High sensitivity
