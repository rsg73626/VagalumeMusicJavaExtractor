VIOLATOR

A war against time, destined to lose, I'll just sit and watch TV
A magical force, hypnotic drool, I'll take in all that I can see
I'm seeing chains... now hold me down, the recline of modern man
Neatly displayed and bundled lies, an hour glass and I'm the sand

Chorus:

Generator, decimator ahhh
Universal, devastator ahhh
ahhhhhhhhhh

A cyber involved diversity, so straighten up and go online
Sexual drive intensity, the darkest pit that you can find

Im holding this key to be erased, put your life into a disk
Strainful powers, social disgrace, wages war with little risk

Chorus:

Generator, decimator ahhh
Universal, devastator ahhh
Substitution, evolution ahhh
Electronic, absolution ahhh
ahhhhhhhhhhh, yeeeeeeeeiee, Ohhh

Ohhh...my head is always lost and always changing mind
Whats wrong just feels so right
I think I'm going blind......... 

Chorus:

Generator, decimator ahhh
Universal, devastator ahhh
Substitution, evolution ahhh
Electronic, absolution ahhh
