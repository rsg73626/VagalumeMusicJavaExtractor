TELL ME

In violation of a thought a long long time ago
Impressive reasons fill the caverns of my mind
No celebration for the people that I didn't know
Connected even though there's nothing left to find

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my insperiation help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneat the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question 
But still I wonder why

Poetic justice never seems to make the world feel right
Chaotic voices in the darkenss call your name
You turn away from me whenever I remind you
Of the day the sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my insperiation help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneat the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question 
But still I wonder why

There's so much pain
There's so much war
There's so much hurt
I can't take no more
Won't you come and take me to another day
Take me far away

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneat the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question 
But still I wonder why
