DON'T TURN AWAY

Under the sun I stand
Over the wings of fallen angels.
I can't believe the things you show me.
In my dreams I have you next to me.

Forever gone is love.
Out of control, I fall in trenches.
And if you leave me empty,
How will I design the world I need?

In your eyes you see it done:
Colors drain away like water.
Distance all but disappeared,
And nothing can be done.

Don't; don't turn away.
Don't let it take you over.
You cannot give in.
Don't let it take you over now.

And in your eyes I catch
A tiny glimpse of heaven calling.
You try to stay in touch, but can you
End what has no real beginning.

In your eyes you see it done:
Colors drained away like water.
Distance all but disappeared,
And nothing can be done.

Don't; don't turn away.
Don't let it take you over.
You cannot give in.
Don't let it take you over now.

And I walk away

And leave you right where you stand
I'll never regret all that I said to you.
But you never turned away

You never turned away.
You never turned away.
You never turned away.
You never turned away.

Don't; don't turn away.
Don't let it take you over.
You cannot give in.
Don't let it take you over.

Don't; don't turn away.
Don't let it take you over.
You cannot give in.
Don't let it take you over now.
