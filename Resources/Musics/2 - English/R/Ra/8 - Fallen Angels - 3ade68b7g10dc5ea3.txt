FALLEN ANGELS

My eyes don't see the obvious
It's way too far to go
Forget about the rest of me
There's nothing left to know

I see fallen angels
When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see fallen angels
As I'm walking in the streets
Silently preparing
For what they'll do to me

You see, I'm kinda paranoid
My luck, it seems to have run out
So I will point the finger now
Beyond the shadow of a doubt

I see fallen angels
When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see fallen angels
As I'm walking in the streets
Silently preparing
For what they'll do to me

I see fallen angels
When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see fallen angels
As I'm walking in the streets
Silently preparing

I see fallen angels
When I try to go to sleep
(I see fallen angeeeeeels)
And they're always watching
I see fallen angels
As I'm walking in the streets
(I see fallen angeeeeeels)
Silently preparing
For what they'll do to me
