UNDERTAKEN

Lonely all the world I see there's a ripple in your mind
Far beyond the grass I grasp the first thing that I find
Numbers march across the sky in a prisonary home
Ghosts have turned their backs to me, I'm finally alone

Can you hear me 
Where do you stand
Are you there
Try to take my hand
Do you fear me
Have you forgotten how to love
My heart is undertaken

Forests filled with life rejoice a momentary joy
Single minded heavies hover playing with their toys
Tiny insignificant apparitions made divine
Toss aside their virtues turning water into wine

Can you hear me 
Where do you stand
Are you there
Try to take my hand
Do you fear me
Have you forgotten how to love
My heart is undertaken

Can you hear me 
where do you run
Are you there
why must you live as one
Do you fear me
your soul cannot be gone
My heart is undertaken


The severing of a journey embodied by a woven mystic seam
While reality departs at the exception of a dream

Can you hear me 
Where do you stand
Are you there
Try to take my hand
Do you fear me
Have you forgotten how to love
My heart is undertaken

Can you hear me 
where do you run
Are you there
why must you live as one
Do you fear me
your soul cannot be gone
My heart is undert-----

--CAN YOU HEAR ME?
ARE YOU THERE?
DO YOU FEAR ME?
MY HEART IS UNDERTAKEN!
