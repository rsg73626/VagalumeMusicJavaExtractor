BROKEN HEARTED SOUL

I can't believe I've fallen down to my knees
They've got me begging me "Please, there has to be another way"
My broken chest, it hurts, it won't let me breathe,
I'm staring down at my wrists, you know I have to insist

That you talk to me
Why won't you talk to me

When did I want to be lonely
When did I want to be cold
I can't believe that it's over
The beating of my broken hearted soul

I can't believe that I am down in this hole
Always paying the toll for having found my way to you
It doesn't matter that I pushed you away
When you wanted to stay, I had to find a way to make you

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me

When did I want to be lonely
When did I want to be cold
I can't believe that it's over
The beating of my broken hearted soul

When did I want to be lonely
When did I want to be cold
I can't believe that it's over
The feeling in my broken hearted soul

Please don't go
I can't live without you
I love you
You're everything to me
Can't you see?

Don't you dare walk away
This cannot be the end
You're my savior, my lover, my muse, my best friend
I won't smile again
I won't ever be loved
You can't do this to me
If you can hear what I'm saying, please

Talk to me
You never talk to me

When did I want to be lonely
When did I want to be cold
I can't believe that it's over
The beating of my broken hearted soul

When did I want to be lonely
When did I want to be cold
I can't believe that it's over
The feeling in my broken hearted soul
