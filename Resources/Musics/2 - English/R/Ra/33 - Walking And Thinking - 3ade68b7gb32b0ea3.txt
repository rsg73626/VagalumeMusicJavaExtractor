WALKING AND THINKING

From the air I see your loneliness
You carry on despite your fear
Inside a box you keep your sanity
And it will never seem clear, to me

Over the hills, the light, it flows...
It shows the angels laughing
And where is the love that we're supposed to find?
Lost in a maze of games so very dark and overwhelming
Lost in these thoughts that seem to rule my mind

A simple spell cast is broken through
The force of life decides to bend
You lay below the sacred stormy skies
And you will write the end... for me

Over the hills, the light, it flows...
It shows the angels laughing
And where is the love that we're supposed to find?
Lost in a maze of games so very dark and overwhelming
Lost in these thoughts that seem to rule my mind

The door will close and I will be denied
A dagger thrust into my chest
You claim yourself to the victory
But it is I... who will rest, in peace

Over the hills, the light, it flows
It shows the angels laughing
And where is the love that we're supposed to find?
Lost in a maze of games so very dark and overwhelming
Lost in these thoughts that seem to rule my mind (2x)
