FAR ENOUGH

It's on my face
It's in my feelings
The scars that carry on your name
You fold your arms
You don't believe me
You don't like to think you cause me pain

Yet here I am
Your worst creation
A solless reckless imbecile
Don't turn away
You can't ignore it
It's what you wanted all the while

You've taken this far enough
You think but you're not so tough
You've taken this far enough from me

I'm getting bored
With isolation
I'm getting sick of all your crap
You stare me down
But you don't see me
You do the crime I take the wrap

If someone saw this
They'd say it's crazy
If someone saw this they'd probably lose their mind
So now I'm done
You can't evade me
There's someone else I need to find

You've taken this far enough
You think but you're not so tough
You've taken this far enough from me
You've taken this far enough
I'm so sick of all your stuff
You've taken this far enough from me
You're stuck in a fantasy
But my heart knows what's real
There's nothing left to say

Maybe

Maybe i'm not meant to be
You cannot? for reality
Look around and close your eyes
You'll get the message in disguise

You've taken this far enough
You think but you're not so tough
You've taken this far enough from me
You've taken this far enough
I'm so sick of all your stuff
You've taken this far enough from me
You've taken this far enough from me
