FEELS REAL

Feels real
When I feel this good
I forget about my problems
I can finally enjoy all little things
That's when I feel things will be alright
I can tell from the way I'm inside

Everything I feel finally feels real
Everything I feel finally feels real
Everything I feel finally feels real

Everything is here and inside of my head
I can't remember when I was dead
I just think about the way that I like to think about you
And I think that you like me too

Everything I feel finally feels real
Everything I feel finally feels real
Everything I feel finally feels real
