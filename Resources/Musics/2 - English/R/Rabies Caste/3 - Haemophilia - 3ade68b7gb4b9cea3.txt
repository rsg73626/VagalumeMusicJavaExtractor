HAEMOPHILIA

Everyone's opinion affects me
Listen to all the people who try to be
Closer to what i am
Where the hell were they when i needed them

Never coming back from this place
Never coming back here again
Trying so hard to understand
What i've been through all those years

Then everyone will say i don't support you
The possibilities are not expanded
How much longer will it last
You and i and them it's so good to be half dead

When everything has fallen apart
Broken pieces in the mud.
