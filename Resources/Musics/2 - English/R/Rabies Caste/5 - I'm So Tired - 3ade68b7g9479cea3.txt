I'M SO TIRED

Watch out, now you better take it
I saved your life when it was shit
Against me there's no one standing
I saved you when youwere not here

I am so tired now

Watch me, now you'll never make it
I saw when you were my enemy
Against me there's no one standing
I saved you when you were not here

What do you know, i've been fallen slow
Smelled like shit cannot stand it
You know i won't feel that again
You know i won't fall down again

What do you know i've been fallen slow
Smelled like shit i cannot stand it
I can't stand my own breed
And i can't stand my own blood.
