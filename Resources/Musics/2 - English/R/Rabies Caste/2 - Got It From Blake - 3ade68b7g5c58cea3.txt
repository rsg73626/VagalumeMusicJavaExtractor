GOT IT FROM BLAKE

You kill for money so obviously
It was supposed to be a secret

When blood spills from the mouths
You do not stop
That's because you are the one
Who holds the gun
Seven people on the floor begging for life
None of them will ever stay alive

I wasn't sure i liked it that way
The time i got it from blake
Atleast you know you disappoint me
We'll carry on i got it from blake.
