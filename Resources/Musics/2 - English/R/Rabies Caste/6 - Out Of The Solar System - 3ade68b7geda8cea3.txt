OUT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

I said not now so that's over
In your black eyes i see sorrow
Not that i don't respect your choice
Just mine has been so damn different

I see that you could but not too high
Instead of me you chase to die
I can't tell you how sorry i am
Unable to talk between you and i

So deep diving so hard trying
To get back home in time for you
You don't seem to be realistic
Just too much of pleasure in life

I won't call anytime
Right below with the knife
I won't call anytime
Right below i want you to leave
Now you're gone.
