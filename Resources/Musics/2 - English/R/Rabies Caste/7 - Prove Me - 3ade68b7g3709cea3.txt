PROVE ME

Please don't take it any further, right now
I can't see anything clearly anymore, heads down
Now love it how could i have thought of
You and i here in the same space
Shame on you we're full of hatred
I cannot, i can't remember

Those things are not over just yet,
Right now
Just hope you're right, just to prove me, prove me

It's just another day
I can see the future
I can feel the scissors
You can see the future
You can taste the freedom.
