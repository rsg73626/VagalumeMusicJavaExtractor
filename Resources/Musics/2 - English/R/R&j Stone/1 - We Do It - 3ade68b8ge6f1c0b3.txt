WE DO IT

Just when I think
I'm getting tired of you again
You turn right back
And give that special smile again
Girl you're something
You've got that something deep inside
And it won't oh no
It just won't give in at all
Give in at all

And we do it
We got a lot of real love
And a deep affection
And we do it
Every night every day
Any possible way
But we do it
Aint nothing in the world
Ever gonna stop us
We do it

Just when you say
It's all too much you gotta get away
That's when I feel the pain inside I know it's real
But there's something... hey baby
Pulls you right on back to me
And it won't... ohh no
It just won't
Give in at all
Give in at all

And we do it
We got a lot of real love
And a deep affection
And we do it
Every night every day
Any possible way
But we do it
Aint nothing in the world
Ever gonna stop us
We do it
