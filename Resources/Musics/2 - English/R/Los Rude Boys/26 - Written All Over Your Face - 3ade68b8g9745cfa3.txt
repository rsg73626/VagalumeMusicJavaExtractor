WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE

Its written all over your face
you dont have to say a word
just smile a smile a smile
a smile for me
its better than any word i ever heard
I know that im a very lucky guy
to have someone like you
i never met a girl in my life like you before
you make all my dreams come true
I love the way you carry you
you have a lot of class and good taste
and you dont have to say how much you care for me
because its written all over your face
Dont you know
its written all over your face
you dont have to say a word
just smile a smile a smile
a smile for me
its better than any word i ever heard
You dont have to say how much you love me, girl
because you show me every day
you kiss me, you miss me, you hold me very tight
you love me in every way
I love the way you carry you
you gotta lotta class and good taste
and you dont have to say how much you care for me
because its written all over, written all over your, your, your face, baby
Its written all over your face
you dont have to say a word
just smile a smile a smile
a smile for me
its better than any word i ever heard
To the bridge
its written on your face
that you really care
its written on your face
that you really care
Its written all over your face
you dont have to say a word
just smile a smile a smile
a smile for me
its better than any word i ever heard
