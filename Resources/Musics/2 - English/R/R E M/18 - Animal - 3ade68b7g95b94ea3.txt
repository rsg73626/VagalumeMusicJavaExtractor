ANIMAL

Hey what's the big deal? 
Tell me how to feel? 
I know where we boomeranged and fell from grace. 
Point me to the stars I'm up for the chase. 
I know where we fell on our face. 
Jump with me. 
You jump with me. 

Hey, what's the big deal- 
I'm an animal. 
(The answer landed on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(The future and the truth, on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(It's calling me to work it out.) [x2] 

(Whoa) 

I don't wanna boomerang. 
I don't wanna cannonball. 
I'm not angling. 
I don't want to fall. 
Tell me I'm the anchor of my own ascension. 
Tell me I'm a tourist in the 4th dimension? 

Hey, what's the big deal- 
I'm an animal. 
(The answer landed on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(The future and the truth, on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(It's calling me to work it out.) 

(Whoa) 

work it out. 

I am vibrating at the speed of light. 
Take my hand, we'll wind up the night. 
Spin me, win me, lift me, kis me. 
Trip me, trust me, cuss me, judge me. 
touch me now. 
you take my hand. 
you trust me now 
you understand.
