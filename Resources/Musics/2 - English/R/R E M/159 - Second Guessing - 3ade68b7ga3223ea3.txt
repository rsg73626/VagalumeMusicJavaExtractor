SECOND GUESSING

(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe)



Why're you trying to second guess me?
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season?
Who will be your book this season?

Why're you trying to second guess me?
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season?
Who will be your book this season?

(chorus)
Here we are, here we are, here we are

Why're you trying to second guess me?
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season?
Be in my club, write a book this season

(repeat chorus 2x)
