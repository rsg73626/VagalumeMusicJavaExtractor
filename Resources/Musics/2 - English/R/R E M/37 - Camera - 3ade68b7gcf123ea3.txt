CAMERA

(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe)



(chorus 1)
From the inside room when the front room greeting
Becomes your special book, it was simple then
When the party lulls, if we fall by the side

(chorus 2)
Will you be remembered? will she be remembered?
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face?
I fell by your bed once, I didn't want to tell you
I should keep myself in between the pages
Of the green light room if we fall by the side

(repeat chorus 2)

(repeat chorus 1)

I still like you, can you remember?
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face?
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face?
