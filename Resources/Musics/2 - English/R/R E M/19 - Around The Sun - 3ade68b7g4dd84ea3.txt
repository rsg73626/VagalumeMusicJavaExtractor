AROUND THE SUN

I want the sun to shine on me 
I want the truth to set me free 
I wish the followers would lead 
with a voice so strong it could knock me to my knees 

Hold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming 
hold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off 
hold onto this boy a little longer 
take another trip around the sun 

If I jumped into the ocean to believe 
If I climbed a mountain would I have to reach? 
do I even dare to speak?--to dream?--believe? 
give me a voice so strong 
I can question what I have seen 

Hold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming 
hold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off 
hold onto this boy a little longer 
take another trip around the sun 

Around the sun 
around the sun 
around the sun 

Let my dreams set me free. 
believe. believe. 
now now now now now now.
