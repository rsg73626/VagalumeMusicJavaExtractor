DAYSLEEPER

Receiving department, 3 a.m. 
staff cuts have socked up the overage 
directives are posted. 
no callbacks complaints. 
everywhere is calm. 

Hong Kong is present 
Taipei awakes 
all talk of circadian rythm 

I see today with a newsprint fray 
my night is colored headache grey 
daysleeper 

the bull and the bear are marking 
their territories 
they're leading the blind with 
their international glories 

I'm the screen, the blinding light 
I'm the screen, I work at night. 

I see today with a newsprint fray 
my night is colored headache grey 
don't wake me with so much. 
daysleeper 

I cried the other night 
I can't even say why 
fluorescent flat caffeine lights 
its furious balancing 

I'm the screen, the blinding light 
I'm the screen, I work at night. 
I see today... 
don't wake me with so much... the 
ocean machine is set to 9 
I'll squeeze into heaven and valentine 
my bed is pulling me, 
gravity 
daysleeper. daysleeper. 
daysleeper. daysleeper. daysleeper.
