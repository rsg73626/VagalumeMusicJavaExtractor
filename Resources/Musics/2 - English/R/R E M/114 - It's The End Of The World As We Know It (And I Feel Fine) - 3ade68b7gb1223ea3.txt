IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT (AND I FEEL FINE)

That's great! It starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, Listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs
Dummy serve your own needs
Feed it off an knock, speed, grunt, no, strength
The Ladder start to clatter with a fear fight down, height

Wire in a fire representing seven games
And a government for hire at a combat site
Left her and coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team reporters, baffled, trumped
tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane
Fine, Then

Uh-oh. Overflow population, common food
But it'll do to save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs
Listen to your heart beat
Dummy with a rapture and the reverend and the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine

Six o'clock-- T. V. hour
Don't get caught in foreign towers
Slash and burn, return
Listen to yourself churn
Lock it in, uniforming, book burning
blood letting
Every motive escalate
Automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive
Step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh
This means no fear cavalier
renegade steer clear!
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies!
Offer me solutions, and offer me alternatives
and I decline!

It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine

The other night I tripped at Knox
Continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line
LEONARD BERNSTEIN
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, BOOM!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, bug, net, right?
Right

It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine... fine
