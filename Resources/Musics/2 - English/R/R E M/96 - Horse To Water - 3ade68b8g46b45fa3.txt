HORSE TO WATER

I could have kept my head down
I might have kept my mouth shut
I should have held my own,
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.

You’re only as big as your battles.
Rattle my cage with your shadow.
I’m a phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don’t you know that what comes around goes around?

I’m not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

Don’t darken my doorstep again,
You're mixing up living in chin-chin,
You're mixing up lose with win-win,
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.

You stumble on glass top table,
TV’s chewing shock-gone cable
Pump me up a beanstalk fable
And I’ll call this entertainment
‘cause Humpty’s falling down.

I’m not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

Pick a fight an ultra-buzzy bubble
Friday night fuckin’ fried-up pub crawl
Phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don’t you know that what comes around goes around?

I’m not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

It’s not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round
It’s going down, down, down
This runaround, round, round
is bound to pound
the daylights out of you!
