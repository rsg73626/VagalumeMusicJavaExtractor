RADIO FREE EUROPE

Resign yourself that radio's gonna stay
Reason it could polish up the grey
Put that put that put that up the wall
That this isnt country at all

Raving stations, beside yourself

Keep me out of country in the word
Deal the porch is leading us absurd
Push that, push that, push to the hull
That this isnt nothing at all
Straight of the boat, where to go?

Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio free europe, radio

Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pushig palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that before all
That this isn't fourtunate at all

Raving stations, beside yourself
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
Radio free europe, radio

Decide yourself, calling all of the medias too fast

Keep me out of country in the word
Disappoint is unto us absurd

Straight off the boat, where to go?
Calling on in transit, calling on in transet
Radio free europe
