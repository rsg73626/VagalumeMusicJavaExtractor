WEST OF THE FIELDS

Long gone, intuition to assume are gone when we try
Dream of a living jungle in my way back home when we
die

(chorus)
West of the fields, west of the fields, west of the
fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone. 
West of the fields

Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming
When we try to listen with your eyes oversimplify

(repeat chorus)

The animals, how strange. Try, try to stick it in
The animals, how strange. Try, try to stick it in

Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming when we try
Listen through your eyes when we die

(repeat chorus 2x)
