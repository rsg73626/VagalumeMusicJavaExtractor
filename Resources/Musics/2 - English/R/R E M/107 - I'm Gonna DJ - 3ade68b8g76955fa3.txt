I'M GONNA DJ

Death is pretty final
I'm collecting vinyl
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

Cause if heaven does exists with a kickin' playlist
I don't wanna miss it at the end of the world

Hey, steady, steady
Hey, steady, steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

It's on my mind
It's in my mind
It's what I found
It's what I find

It's on my mind
It's in my mind
It's what I found
Oh, my, my, my 

But "I'll spin my way right throug it"
Claims enthusiast Jack Pruitt
As the moths circle the moon
As you're circling the room

Music will provide the light
You cannot resist
You cannot resist
You cannot resist

And the fanzine that get tangled
As you willie and you wangle
In your walk-up in Seattle
Where you fought the nascent bottle

And you threw the thread and throttle
Let us raise another bottle
Raise another bottle
Raise another bottle

Because death is pretty final
I'm collecting vinyl
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

Hey, steady, steady
Hey, steady, steady
I don't wanna go 
Until I'm good and ready

It's on my mind
It's in my mind
It's what I found
It's what I find

It's on my mind
It's in my mind
It's what I found
Oh, my, my, my

Hey, steady, steady
Hey, steady, steady
I don't wanna go
Until I'm good and ready

Hey, steady, steady
Hey, steady, steady
I don't wanna go
Until I'm good and ready

Music will provide the light
You cannot resist
You cannot resist
You cannot resist
Yeah!
