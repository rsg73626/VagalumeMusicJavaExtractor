ACCELERATE

Sinking fast to winch me to my feet
No time to argue with belief
I'm not alone,
 A thousand others dropping
Faster than me
What put me here?
Nothing to hold on to
Nowhere to brake

Where is the rip chord,
 The trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question
 The choices I made
I've got to fall in another direction

The last thing I remember
 Was climbing up the stairs
I threw the window open
 In challenge and despair
I don't know what I needed
I needed time 
I needed to escape
I saw the future turn
Upside-down and hesitate

Where is the rip chord,
 The trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question
 The choices I made
I've got to fall in another direction
Accelerate

The vista I see now is changing
Uncertainty is suffocating
Our hope has never felt so great and
I lay right down
A pounded pulse
Make it go
Make it slow down
Go

Where is the rip chord,
 The trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question
 The choices I made
I've got to fall in another direction

The city burning,
 It's like it's ready to explode
Accelerate to make it slow
Make it go
Accelerate to make it slow
Make it go
I'm incomplete
I'm incomplete
I'm incomplete
