THERE SHE GOES AGAIN

(Lou Reed)



(chorus 1)
There she goes again (there she goes)
She's out on the street again (there she goes)
She's down on her knees my friend (there she goes)
Won't have to ask her please again (there she goes)

(chorus 2)
Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
You know she won't make it with just any guy
What can you do (there she goes)
See her walking down the street (there she goes)
With all your friends she's gonna meet (there she goes)
You'd better hit her

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2 2x)
