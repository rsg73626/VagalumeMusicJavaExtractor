WE ALL GO BACK TO WHERE WE BELONG

I dreamt what you were offering
Imagine lying next to me
You should
And your reputation talks

I will write our story in my mind
Write about our dreams and triumphs
This might be my "Innocence Lost"

I can taste the ocean on your skin
That is where it all begins
I dreamed that we were elephants
Water, sand, clouds of dust
And woke up thinking we were free

I can taste the ocean on your skin
That is where it all begins
We all go back to where we belong
We all go back to where we belong

Is this really what you want
Is this really what you want

I can taste the ocean on your skin
That is where it all begins
We all go back to where we belong
We all go back to where we belong

Is this really what you want
Is this really what you want
