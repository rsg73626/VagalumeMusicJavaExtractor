WAIT

(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe)



You got your problems darling
I got mine too
You know that
Maybe it's time for you to come through
Because I'm fed up with waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
What are you gonna do?

I've almost given up hope
Then what else is new?
You know that
I'm at the end of my rope trying to hang on to you
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
What are you gonna do

You better wait (wait!)
Don't go away now darling, wait (wait!)
Why don't you stay?
You better wait (wait!)
Don't go away now, wait (wait!)
Why don't you stay?

(chorus)
I know that you're confused
It's no crime
You better hurry sugar
Cuz we're running out of time
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
What are you gonna do?

(repeat chorus)

I don't wanna walk on the same stage with you
Then the bells begin to blow in my head
If things don't turn out right
It's gonna be all right

(repeat chorus 4x)
