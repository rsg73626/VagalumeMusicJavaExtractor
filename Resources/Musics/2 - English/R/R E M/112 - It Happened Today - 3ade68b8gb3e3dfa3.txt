IT HAPPENED TODAY

This is not a parable
This is a terrible
This is a terrible thing

Yes I will rhyme that, after, after all I've done today
I have earned my wings

It happened today. Hooray! Hooray!
It happened. Hip, hip, hooray!

We'll leave the allegory to a different Bible story
Out of deference, defiance, the choice
Closing on a promise, after, after all I've done today
I have earned my voice

It happened today. Hooray! Hooray!
It happened. Hip, hip, hooray!

Oohs, and aahs, and awws
