HOUSTON

If the storm doesn’t kill me the government will
I’ve got to get that out of my head
It’s a new day today and the coffee is strong
I’ve finally got some rest

So a man’s put to task and challenges
I was taught to hold my head high
Let's the mine
Make the best of what today has

Houston is filled with promise
Laredo is a beautiful place
And Galveston seems like that song that I loved
It's meaning has not been erased

And so there are claims forgiven
And so there are things that are gone

Houston is filled with promise
Laredo is a beautiful place
And Galveston seems like that song that I loved
It's meaning has not been erased

And some things, they fall to the wayside
Their memory is yet to be still
Belief has not filled me
And so I am put to the test
