ME, MARLON BRANDO, MARLON BRANDO AND I

We live and dream about the future
Please ask me up I need to count well now
Sit through the annals of our favorite times
Our heroes and all their fade out thoughts
Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I say

Lay me down, down, down, down
Lay me down, down, down, down, down
Help me off to sleep
Or take me deep again

We live and dream about our heroes
I listened closely and I said
I'm not sure where to place myself here friend
I might wanna go on wings instead
The winners write the rule books
The histories are never [right]

Lay me down, down, down, down
Lay me down, down, down, down, down
Help me off to sleep (down down down)
Or take me deep again (down down down)
I heard what you said (down down down)
I picture brass rings in your head
What golden [Brahms] in my mind
Our brass is mixed with red
