FINAL STRAW

As I raise my head to broadcast my objection 
as your latest triumph draws the final straw 
who died and lifted you up to perfection? 
and what silenced me is written into law. 

I can't believe where circumstance has thrown me 
and I turn my head away 
if I look I'm not sure that I could face you. 
not again. not today. not today. 

If hatred makes a play on me tomorrow 
and forgiveness takes a back seat to revenge 
there's a hurt down deep that has not been corrected. 
there's a voice in me that says you will not win. 

And if I ignore the voice inside, 
raise a half glass to my home. 
but it's there that I am most afraid, 
and forgetting doesn't hold. it doesn't hold. 

Now I don't believe and I never did 
that two wrongs make a right. 
if the world were filled with the likes of you 
then I'm putting up a fight. I'm putting up a fight. 
putting up a fight. make it right. make it right. 

Now love cannot be called into question. 
forgiveness is the only hope I hold. 
and love- love will be my strongest weapon. 
I do believe that I am not alone. 

For this fear will not destroy me. 
and the tears that have been shed 
it's knowing now where I am weakest 
and the voice in my head. in my head. 

Then I raise my voice up higher 
and I look you in the eye 
and I offer love with one condition. 
with conviction, tell me why. 
tell me why. 
tell me why. 
look me in the eye. 
tell me why.
