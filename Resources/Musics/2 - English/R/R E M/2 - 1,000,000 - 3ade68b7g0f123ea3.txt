1,000,000

Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too
All along the tomb, all along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too

I could live a million, I could live a million, I could live a million,
I could live a million years

(repeat)

All along, all along, all along the tomb
Secret in, secret in, secret in the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too

(repeat chorus 2)
