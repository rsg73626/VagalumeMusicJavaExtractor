LEAVING NEW YORK

It's quiet now, and what it brings is everything...
Comes calling back a brilliant night, I'm still awake
I looked ahead I'm sure I saw you there
You don't need me to tell you now, that nothing can compare
You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden the frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York never easy
I saw the life fading out
Now life is sweet and what it brings I tried to take...
The loneliness, it wears me out, it lies in way
And on our lost till in my eyes, shadow of necklace across your thigh
I might have lived my life in a dream, but i swear, this is real
Memory fuses in shatters out glass, but carry your future, forget the past
But it's you, it's what i feel.

You might have laughed if I told you (it's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden the frown (change)
You might have succeeded in changing me (it's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around (change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out

You find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart, change...
I told you, forever, I love you, forever (you find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart)
I told you, I love you, I love you, forever (you find it in your heart, change)
I told you, forever, I love you, forever (you find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart)
I told you, I love you, I love you, forever (you find it in your heart, change)

You might have laughed if I told you (forever, forever,I told You, forever)
You might have hidden the frown (change)
You might have succeeded in changing me (it's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around (change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the life fading out (change)
Leaving new york never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (change)
Leaving new york never wasy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the life fading out (change)
