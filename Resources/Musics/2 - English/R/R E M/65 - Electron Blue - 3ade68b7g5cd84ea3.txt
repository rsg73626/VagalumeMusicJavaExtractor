ELECTRON BLUE

You're on your ear, the ocean's near. 
the light has started to fade. 
your high is timed, 
you found the climb 

it's hard to focus on more than what's 
in front of you, electron blue. 
adventure rings with a page. 
and when, 

it dawns on you, it singes blue, 
your buzz beginning to wane. 

adventure has laid its claim on you 
it's all you want to do 
you, you know where to run 
you run electron blue. 

and who am I? 
I'm just a guy. 
I've got a story like everyone 

but in your eyes, 
you looked surprised. 
and didn't know where to run. 

I looked to her 
she's found the cure 
her future's already begun. 

tomorrow is gaining speed on you 
it's all you want to do 
you, you know where to run 
you run electron blue. 

you, you know where to run 
you run electron blue. 

so bide your time 
you'll feel the climb 
your high it builds like a lightning storm 

it sings like pearls 
you know that girl 
and no one is any the wiser so 

as if on cue 

electron blue 

tomorrow is gaining speed on you 
it's all you want to do 
you, you know where to run 
you run electron blue. 

you, you know where to run 
you run electron blue. 

you, you know where to run 
you run electron blue.
