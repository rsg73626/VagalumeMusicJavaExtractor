CATAPULT

(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe)



We were little boys
We were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, opie mouth. Question:
Did we miss anything? did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything? did we miss anything?
Catapult (catapult), catapult, catapult (catapult), catapult

(chorus)
We were little boys
We were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, opie mouth
We in step, in hand, your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope, a question:
Did we miss anything? did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything? did we miss anything?
Catapult (catapult), catapult, catapult (catapult), catapult

March could be darker, march could be darker
Catapult (catapult), catapult, catapult (catapult), catapul

(repeat chorus)
