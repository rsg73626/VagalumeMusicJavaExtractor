9-9

(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe)



(chorus 1)
Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced
Now what does that mean?
Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord, hesitate

(chorus 2)
Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
All nine yards down her back

(chorus 3)
Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

(repeat chorus 2)

(repeat chorus 3)

What is in my mind?
What is in my mind?

(repeat chorus 1)

(repeat chorus 2)

(repeat chorus 3)

Conversation fear, conversation fear, conversation fear
