FALLS TO CLIMB

I'll take the position
assume the missionary part
you work by committee,
you had me pegged from the start.
I'll be pounce pony,
phony maroney,
pony before the cart.
I'll be pounce pony.
this ceremony
only fills my heart.

who cast the final stone?
who threw the crushing blow?
someone has to take the fall
why not me?

a punch toy volunteer 
a weakling on its knee.
is all you want to hear
and all you want to see.
romantically, you'd martyr me
and miss this story's point
it is my strength, my destiny
this is the role that I have chosen.

who cast the final stone?
who threw the crushing blow?
someone has to take the fall
why not me?

gentlemen mark your opponents 
fire into your own ranks.
pick the weakest as strategic
move. square off. to
meet your enemy.
for each and every gathering 
a scapegoat falls to climb.
as I step forward, silently.
deliberately mine

who cast the final stone?
who threw the crushing blow?
someone has to take the fall
why not me? why not me.
had consequence chose differently
had fate its ugly head
my actions make me beautiful
and dignify the flesh

me. I am free. free.
