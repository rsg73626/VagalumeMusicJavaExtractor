BEACHBALL

Tonight's alive
The beachball is set to fly
Those well-tequilla'd guys
who smile at strangers.

Ã¡ tes souhaits
Ã¡ tes amours chÃ©ri
You give a little sneeze and dance the rhu-rhu-rhu-rhu-rhumba

This life is sweet.
You're dancin' in the street.
Who knows who we might meet?
You're too fine.

The little weekend's here.
Thursday has an ear.
Her coffee-clash career, she talks to strangers.

And kissing by the sea.
Particular to me.
'ti punch, mojito, sling and dance the rhu-rhu-rhu-rhu-rhumba.

This life is sweet.
You're dancin' in the street.
Who knows who, you and me
You're too fine.

We flash the seaside sky
with starfish butterflies
to cast a spell and
welcome locals
weekenders and strangers.

You're too fine.
You're too fine.
You're too fine.
