WHAT U GET IS WHAT U SEE

Forget your sweetest dreams
Forget it ´cause it breaks
You ask yourself what went wrong
When we decided to jump off

Forget what you know
Forget what you saw
All those flashes drove us blind
You can´t get them off your mind
We let them taste what they´ll never have

Forget the place
Forget the time
What you get is what you see
I´m trying to say I don´t care
What´s your perversion

Forget the sweetest days
Forget it ´cause it breaks
How long will you be a star?
Waiting for the show to start
What you get is what you see

Forget the place
Forget the time
What you get is what you see
I´m trying to say I don´t care
What´s your perversion
