A PERFECT WORLD

Listen to me man, let´s take a walk,
I just have to scream out how happy I am.
I see the world´s different from what it was.
All grief is gone now, joy´s come at last

The war is a series, a TV show,
and soldiers are pop stars, fighting for Oscars.
I´ve seen Bush kissing Osama´s cheek,
so christians and arabs can joyfully meet.

You may think this place has just gone nuts.
It´s just because you live in a perfect world.

Every kid looks happy in the ex-third world,
´cause their stomachs are full, and oppression´s gone.
Revolution is over ´cause we all believed,
and Marcos drinks whisky instead of tears.

We both think this place has just gone nuts.
It´s just because we live in a perfect world.
