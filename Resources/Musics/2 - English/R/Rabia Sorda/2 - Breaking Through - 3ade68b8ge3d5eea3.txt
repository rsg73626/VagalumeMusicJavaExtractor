BREAKING THROUGH

Breakdown, noises way too loud, breakdown
Fall through, falling to the ground, Breakdown

Waiting for the moment to break
Waiting for the moment to break
Waiting for the moment - to break through
Fallen out of grace

Breaking through the fear - why?
Breaking through your isolation - why?
What a fucked up situation,
Nothing´s for real

Breaking through the fear - why?
Breaking through your self-aversion and what
Keeps you here, logic´s useless
Nothing´s for real - why?

...I don´t need you!
Breakdown, falling out of place, breakdown
Fall through, falling in and out, breakdown

You can tell me lies
You can tell whatever
Nothing´s right!
