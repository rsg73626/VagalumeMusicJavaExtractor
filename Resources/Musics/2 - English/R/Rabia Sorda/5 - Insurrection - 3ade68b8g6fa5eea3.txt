INSURRECTION

Signs of insurrection appear in the north
And winds of rebellion blow from the south
They´ll hear our voices as well as they´ll
Hear our guns, we´ll get back in control

Songs of revolution are heard in the east
While rebellions rise up in the west
They´ll hear our voices as well as they´ll
Hear our guns, we´ll get back in control
