RADIO PARANOIA

I don't want my freedom I'm scared of it
I don't think about it, please just take it from me
I see the lights, I see the stage, get off the way!
Radio Paranoia take control of this age

Switch on, switch off, Turn it on
Switch on, switch off, Turn it off
Switch on, switch off, Turn it on
Switch on, switch off, Turn it off

Radio Paranoia I die, while evil sleeps tonight
Transmission ends today, it ends today
Radio Paranoia I long to live in days of old
When all your stories were games and only games

Riding the airwaves, I feel home
That's all I need, that's all I want
Sell me illusions, sell me dreams and make me smile
Just don't leave me alone, stay around for a while

Switch on, switch off, Turn it on
Switch on, switch off, Turn it off
Switch on, switch off, Turn it on
Switch on, switch off, Turn it off

Radio Paranoia I die, while evil sleeps tonight
Transmission ends today, it ends today
Radio Paranoia I long to live in days of old
When all your stories were games and only games

Turn it on, let them control your mind
Turn it on, let them control your life
