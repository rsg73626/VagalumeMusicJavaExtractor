METHODS OF CHAOS

Madness my friend
Play my next note
It seems you´ve waited for long
To carry on
Madness old pal
Keep the shadows from me
And taste the chaos in my mind
Come take me

Sometimes it seems
The world comes to an end
Sometimes pain goes away
But not today

Today it all broke into pieces...

Applauses fade away
Stupid smiles
Good night I have to go
Lights turn off right behind me

Methods of Chaos
You´re all unknown
Hiding in the corners of life
Inside me

Methods of Chaos you make feel all this is only
A waste, I´ll live as long as these fingers move
So I don´t get fucking insane

Methods of Chaos you drove me to this place and left me
All by myself, a forever waits at the end
And a never hunts me, embraces me
