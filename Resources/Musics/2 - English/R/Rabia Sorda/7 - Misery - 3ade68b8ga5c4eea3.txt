MISERY

You start to think
There´s no one out there who cares
You need a drug that makes you heal
But healing´s not the answer anyway
´cause healing loses meaning day by day
And there´s no one out there who cares

Starve in a cage, lost and enraged
Raped by the night, consumed in your fight

You fell into hell
Don´t blame me
No, nothing to give
Just blame this misery
You fell into hell
Don´t blame me
There´s nothing to give
Just blame this misery

You start to think
There´s no one out there who cares
You look for a door to run away
But no door will open anyway
´cause if it did it´d lead you into pain
And there´s no one out there who cares

Starve in a cage, lost and enraged
Raped by the night, consumed in your fight

You fell into hell
Don´t blame me
No, nothing to give
Just blame this misery
You fell into hell
Don´t blame me
There´s nothing to give
Just blame this misery
