SAVE ME FROM MY CURSE

Talk to me, you said, what´s in your head?
Can´t you see, I said, that I´m alright.
Talk to me, you said, what´s in your head?
Just nothing got better the way you said.
Can´t you see, I said, that I´m alright,
but suddenly life changed in just a blink.

Don´t try to fix it, it´s my own life,
no more words to say, I´ve got no time.
Don´t try to save me from my course.
Don´t try to fix others mistakes,
there´s nothing you can do anyways.
Don´t try to save me from my course.

Look at me, you said, and so I did.
Walk away, I said, just give it up.
Look at me, you said, and so I did,
there´s no point in saying the same again.
Walk away, I said, just give it up,
but you kept on talking with eyes wide shut.

Everyone´s gone crazy, look who I am.
