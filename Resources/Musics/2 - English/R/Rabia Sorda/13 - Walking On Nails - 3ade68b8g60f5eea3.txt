WALKING ON NAILS

Everything´s been said
No need to fight, no need to understand
Everyone´s scared of what they dream

Look around, look into their eyes
They´re all dying, but none of us will cry
Look around, we´ve done all we could
And what´s the difference?

Some day these wounds will heal
Someday will flee
Where we all can see
Someday we´ll leave as we came:
Walking on nails

Everything´s been told
I walked the road and only found scum
Far and wide I walked in despair
My feet bled

Look around, they´re all alone
They learned to taste, but not to throw up
Walking on nails, we´ve done all we could
And what´s the difference?

Someday these wounds will heal
And someday we´ll flee
Where we all can see
Someday we´ll leave as we came
Walking on nails, walking on nails

That´s the fucking truth
Hit me! Wake me up!
