ALL I REALLY WANTED

We were once together,
I thought it'd last forever,
Then i saw it was untrue,
So i had to let go of you.



Chorus


All i really wanted was to be with you,
All i rreally wanted was something true,
You turned me down,
I refused to frown,
I said to my self,
"there are plenty of fish in the sea,
Someday i'll find the one destined for me,"

I won't sob or cry,
Won't let anything pass me by.
Try here out she's so cool (2 times)
I'm laughing, i'm singing,
The phone is always ringing,
If you won't try her out your the fool (2 times)



Chorus


All i really wanted was to be with you,
All i really wanted was something true,
You turned me down,
I refused to frown,
I said to myself,
"there are plenty of fish in the sea,
Someday i'll find the one destined for me."


I feel as free as can be,
I feel totally like me,
Life is good,
Take a break my friend, (2 times)

I wish i could fly,
Today i'd soar so high,
Oh, yeah,
Fly away, (2 times)


Chorus


All i really wanted was to be with you,
All i really wanted was something true,
You turned me down,
I refused to frown,
I said to my self,
"there are plenty of fish in the sea,
Someday
