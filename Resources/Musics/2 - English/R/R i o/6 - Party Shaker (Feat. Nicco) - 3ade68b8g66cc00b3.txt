PARTY SHAKER (FEAT. NICCO)

Yeah, oh oh, the party shaker
Wake up, wake up
People get it on
Gonna rock your body
Stand up, stand up
We're moving all the way to the top
We're flying high, so high
To the sky
And we land on dance floor
Right, tonight
We will blow this club way

Chorus:
From Rio to Jamaica
We are the party shaker
So welcome everybody
Let's party tonight
Will sip until we're wasted
They call us troublemakers
But we just like to party
And party tonight [2x]

Oh ey oh, oh ey oh
Oh ey oh, oh ey oh
We just like to party
And party tonight

Alright, alright
Love is in the air
All luck girls get naughty
Tonight's the night
We're blinded by disco lights
We're flying high, so high
To the sky
Make it over the rainbow
Right tonight
We will blow this club way

From Rio to Jamaica
We are the party shaker
So welcome everybody
Let's party tonight
Will sip until we're wasted
They call us troublemakers
But we just like to party
And party tonight

Oh ey oh, oh ey oh
