LIKE I LOVE YOU

I believe without your love I would be incomplete!
Oh baby you're all I need,
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen!
(I ever seen)

Bridge:
No I don't wanna break it, no break it!
Before I that I can see
If we're gonna make it,
Gonna make it!
I don't wanna wait another day!
Oh, oh, oh, cause there ain't nobody,
Ain't nobody loves you like I do, girl!

Chorus:
Like I love you!
Like I love you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one!
Ain't nobody loves like I love you!
(So what you wanna say?)
Like I love you!
Like I love you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one like you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one like you!

I'm in need, of your sweet body to fulfill my dreams!
Oh lady, lady can't you see
You'd be the Shwaty in my love spree!

Bridge:
No I don't wanna break it, no break it!
Before I that I can see
If we're gonna make it,
Gonna make it!
I don't wanna wait another day!
Oh, oh, oh, cause there ain't nobody,
Ain't nobody loves you like I do, girl!

Chorus:
Like I love you!
Like I love you!

Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one!
Ain't nobody loves like I love you!
(So what you wanna say?)
Like I love you!
Like I love you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one like you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one like you!

I know that we can make it!
Yeah make it!
And nothing in this galaxy could break it,
Gonna be the one that makes you crazy!
Baby, I only wish that I could make you see!
You see?
You and me!

Bridge:
No I don't wanna break it, no break it!
Before I that I can see
If we're gonna make it,
Gonna make it!
I don't wanna wait another day!
Oh, oh, oh, cause there ain't nobody,
Ain't nobody loves you like I do, girl!

Chorus:
Like I love you!
Like I love you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one!
Ain't nobody loves like I love you!
(So what you wanna say?)
Like I love you!
Like I love you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one like you!
Like I, like I love you!
Cause ain't no one like you!
