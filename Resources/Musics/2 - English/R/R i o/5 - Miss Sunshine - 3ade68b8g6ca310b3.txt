MISS SUNSHINE

I, i'm getting high
When i get my eyes on you like a spy
When you go up i'd never let you down
Girl, we got something going on on the ground

G-g-g-girl shake that booty, don't stop!
Let's get naughty, get up!
And have some fun tonight!

My-my-my-my heart is breaking
Oh, i feel you're taking me high
Miss sunshine
(my little miss sunshine)

Everybody in the club tonight
Can't you see miss sunshine
Girl, i can feel it coming in the air tonight
And it feels alright

My baby, keep moving on
And do it till the break of dawn
So come on, get it on in the club tonight
Won't you be miss sunshine?

I, i'm a blithe
Observed that shorty like a satellite
She turns me on and dance the ruff
Go Pretty lady, baby don't make your move

Oh my gosh, if you see that girl
How she rules my world
She's going on tonight

And my heart don't way like eyes
Girl, you're taking me high
Miss sunshine

Everybody in the club tonight
Can't you see miss sunshine
Girl, i can feel it coming in the air tonight
And it feels alright

My baby, keep moving on
And do it till the break of dawn
So come on, get it on in the club tonight
Won't you be miss sunshine

I, i, i like this girl
The way she's dancing and she's moving around me
I can______ is to party and to make this lady see
Look that time i know it's time for you to know that you'd be mine
My little miss sunshine

Oh my gosh, if you see that girl
How she rules my world
She's going on tonight

And my heart don't way like eyes
Girl, you're taking me high
Miss sunshine

Girl, you keep my fire burning, burning
Girl, you keep my fire burning, burning
Girl, you keep my fire burning, burning
Girl, you keep my fire burning, burning
