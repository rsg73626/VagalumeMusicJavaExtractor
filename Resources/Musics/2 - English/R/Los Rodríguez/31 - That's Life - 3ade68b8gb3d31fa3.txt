THAT'S LIFE

That's life (that's life), 
 That's what all the people say:
 "You're ridin' high in April, 
 Shot down in May."
 But I know
 I'm gonna change that tune
 When I'm back on top, 
 Back on top in June.

 I said that's life (that's life), 
 And as funny as it may seem,
 Some people get their kicks 
 Stompin' on a dream.
 But I don't let it, 
 Let it get me down,
 'Cause this fine old world, 
 It keeps spinnin' around.

 I've been a puppet, a pauper, 
 A pirate, a poet, 
 A pawn and a king;
 I've been up and down 
 And over and out 
 And I know one thing:
 Each time I find myself   
 Flat on my face
 I pick myself up 
 And get back in the race.

 That's life (that's life), 
 I tell you I can't deny it.
 I thought of quitting, baby, 
 But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
 And if I didn't think 
 It was worth one single try,
 I'd jump right on a big bird 
 And then I'd fly.

 I've been a puppet, a pauper, 
 A pirate, a poet, 
 A pawn and a king.
 I've been up and down 
 And over and out 
 And I know one thing.
 Each time I find myself 
 Layin' flat on my face.
 I just pick myself up 
 And get back in the race.

 That's life (that's life), 
 That's life and I can't deny it.
 Many times I thought of cuttin' out 
 But my heart won't buy it.
 But if there's nothin' shakin' 
 Come this here July,
 I'm gonna roll myself up 
 In a big ball and die ...

 My, my!
