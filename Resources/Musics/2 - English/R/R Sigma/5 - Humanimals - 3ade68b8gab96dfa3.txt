HUMANIMALS

I would like to make no sense
I would like to make no sense
I would like to make no sense
I would like to make no sense for anyone
(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight)

I always talked to my (pure?) side
Only because my human side draw me alive
I always talked to my (pure?) side

Only because my human side draw me alive
So so so sorry
I can't make your violence, 
And push'em and push'em bullshit
So so so sorry

I can't breathe your violence, and push'em and push'em bullshit
I always talked to my (pure?) side
Only because my human side draw me alive
I always talked to my (pure?) side
Only because my human side draw me alive
(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight)

I would like to make no sense
I would like to make no sense
I would like to make no sense
I would like to make no sense for huminals
