MAKE ME AN INSTRUMENT

Lord make me an instrument of Your peace
Where there's hatred let me show love
And where there is injury, pardon
And where there is doubt, then faith
And where there's despair, then hope

It's in dying that I will be born
And in giving that I will receive
In loving that I will be loved
This is my faith
It is what I believe
Lord make me an instrument

Lord I am a stranger traveling
In a brutal yet wondrous land
Far from the promise of home
On a journey led by your hand
To where the lion lies down
With the lamb

Father grant that I'd never seek
To be comforted as to console
Let the blood of Your Son cover me
Touching my spirit
Seizing my soul

Lord make me an instrument
Let Your divine mystery guide my heart

Christ within me
Christ before me
Christ behind me
Christ above me
Christ beneath me
To my left and my right
Christ where I lie
And where I arise
Christ in the hearts of all who think of me
Christ on the lips of all who speak of me
Christ in the eyes of all who see me
Make me Your instrument Lord
