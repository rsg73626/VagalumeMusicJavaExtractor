GREAT GOD

You made the earth by your command
You spoke the words and stars appeared
You breathed into the dust and life came forth
You made creation so that we would see you
So that we would know you

You hold the world with perfect love
You showed forgiveness through your son
You made a way when there was just no way
You gave us freedom so that we would see you
So that we would know you

Woah, you are our great god
You are our great god

Lightning struck and thunder roared
The day salvation came
And all the world would never be the same
Creation roared, your people sang
The day your victory came
And now we live, redemption's found the way
You saved the day
