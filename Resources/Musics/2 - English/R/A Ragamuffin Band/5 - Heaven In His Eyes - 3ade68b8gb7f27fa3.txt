HEAVEN IN HIS EYES

See the Teacher sitting on a mountain
See Him walking along the shore
Friends and disciples gathering around Him
Say never spake a man like this before

But why's a man as wise as He
Weeping alone in Gethsemane
Did He know some would never see
The heaven in His eyes

See the Master walking on the water
Hear Him speak and calm an angry wave
Look at Him raising up Jairus's daughter
And with a word Lazarus comes forth from the grave

But why is a man as strong as this
Being betrayed by a good friend's kiss
Could it be that maybe this man missed
The heaven in His eyes

I'm not talking about the pie in the sky
That you good boys and girls get in the by and by
But rather the strength, the strength that we can find
If we've got the guts to try

See the Teacher playing with the children
Hear Him baffle doctors of the law
Look at the people gathering to go with Him
Those who see the vision that He saw

This is why a man as holy as He
Had to die alone on Calvary
It was the only way that we could ever see
The heaven in His eyes

The heaven in His eyes
The heaven in His eyes
Yeah, the heaven in His eyes
The heaven in His eyes
