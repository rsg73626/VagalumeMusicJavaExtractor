ABOVE ALL ELSE

Let every word
And every thought
Be acceptable to you our god
With hearts steadfast
Eyes fixed on you
We will stay true to your path

Having nothing before you
We're casting every idol down
We want to run with the blameless
We want to be unshakeable

With all our hearts
And all our strength
With all we are
We love you god above all else

Above all
Above all
Above all
We worship you
