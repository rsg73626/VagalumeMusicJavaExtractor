I WON'T BELIEVE THIS

I'm screaming from my window
But you're the street below
I'm waiting, oh I'm waiting.
I've waited, oh so long.

Can't we just lay on my roof,
and watch the stars above our heads?
This plan is oh so fool proof,
'Cause you'll be mine once again.

(Oh you'll be mine once again)
(Oh you'll be mine once again)
(Oh you'll be mine once again)

Second day hurts more than the first one.
I can't pretend anymore.
The nights are feeling so long,
and I am all alone.

(Oh you'll be mine once again)
(Oh you'll be mine once again)
(Oh you'll be mine once again)
(Oh you'll be mine once again)
(Oh you'll be mine once again)

I can't believe this
I won't believe this
The seconds are fading,
and you have me waiting,
and now you are leaving.
Oh, I won't believe this.

(I won't believe this)
(I won't believe this)
(I won't believe this)
