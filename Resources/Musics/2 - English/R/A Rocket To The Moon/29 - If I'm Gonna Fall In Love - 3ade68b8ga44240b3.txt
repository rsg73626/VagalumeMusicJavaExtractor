IF I'M GONNA FALL IN LOVE

I'm gonna take my time
Making sure that the feeling's right
Instead of staying up all night
Wondering where you are
Miles and miles away
In a own in another state
I wanna know if you just can take
The thought of us apart

If I'm gonna fall in love
There's gotta be more than just enough
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high

I come from an empty town
Far away from the city sound
I'd lie to settle down someday
And I need to know your plans
Something that'll take you back
I want a girl like that someday

If I'm gonna fall in love
There's gotta be more than just enough
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high

You got a love to own
Gotta live life like a rolling stone
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high

If I'm gonna fall in love

I can't stop wondering why
They take us to a longer time
Maybe I should just let go
But baby all I know
Is I'm gonna fall in love
Someday, someway you'll show up
I'm gonna get that old feeling
I'm gonna get that old high

If I'm gonna fall in love
There's gotta be more than just enough
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high

You got a love to own
Gotta live life like a rolling stone
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high

If I'm gonna fall in love

I gotta get that old high
I gotta get that old high

If I'm gonna fall in love
