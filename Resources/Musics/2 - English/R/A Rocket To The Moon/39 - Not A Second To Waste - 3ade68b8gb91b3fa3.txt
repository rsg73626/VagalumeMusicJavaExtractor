NOT A SECOND TO WASTE

I'm checking your pulse
I'm giving you air
But your body disagrees
And no it don't care at all
I'm wasting my time

Now your eyes roll awake
You're looking at me
You say Darling what happened
Did I fall asleep?
And you carry me home
Cause I know I wasn't here

I'm closing your blinds
I'm shutting your eyes
And now I
I'm afraid I have to go
Whoa 

I'd sing you a song
But i'm feeling quite off
In my heart
It's occupied
And now's not the time

Let's try this again
And this time don't laugh
Cause I'm working on my sentences 
I'm working on my play on words
I'll get it this time

If I am a clock
Than your are the time
I'm patiently waiting
When you're out of line
And i'll be the question
If you'll be the answer

I'm closing your blinds
I'm shutting your eyes
And now I
I'm afraid I have to go
Whoa 

I'd sing you a song
But i'm feeling quite off
In my heart
It's occupied
And now's not the time

If I am a clock
Than your are the time
I'm patiently waiting
When you're out of line
I'm counting the times
When you've lied to my face
My hands were full 
Not a second to waste

If I am a clock
Than your are the time
I'm patiently waiting
When you're out of line
I'm counting the times
When you've lied to my face
My hands were full 
Not a second to waste

I'm closing your blinds
I'm shutting your eyes
And now I
I'm afraid I have to go
Whoa 

I'd sing you a song
But i'm feeling quite off
In my heart
It's occupied
And now's not the time
The time
