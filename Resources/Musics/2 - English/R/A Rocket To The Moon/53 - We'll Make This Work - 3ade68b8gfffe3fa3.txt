WE'LL MAKE THIS WORK

I can't leave
till you're happy
I can stay awake
These cold nights are
Eating me alive
Can you keep me warm?
oh..

Hold your breath
And take your time
Because I can walk you through this again
Sing your heart out like
You are by yourself
I won't laugh this time

It's taken so much time for me
to get to this point again
Oh I've been trying so hard
Been trying so hard
I can't believe you
would hate me for making this work
But I'll forgive you this time

Lets drive forever
please don't let go of my sleeve
because I'd rather you right here
than ever being without me
The lights are bright
But we'll get home

Hold your breath
And take your time
Because I can walk you through this again
Sing your heart out like
You are by yourself
I won't laugh this time
