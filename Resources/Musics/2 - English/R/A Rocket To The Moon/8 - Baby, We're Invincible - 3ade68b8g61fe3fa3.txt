BABY, WE'RE INVINCIBLE

I see you
I'm waiting to make my move
But I'm scared
And I know that you got
Better things to do
I'll touch your hand
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
It's clich√© I know
But baby it's the price we pay
To get the things we've wanted
To get the things we've left behind
It's what you've wanted
What you needed
What you've always dreamt about
Don't take another step
And don't breathe another breath
Unless you're coming back to me

I'm trusting you
And I'm taking the long way home
I'm leaving
It's not because of you
Will you just hold me tight
And never let me go?
I know this whole things wrong
But baby, we're invincible

If I could take these words
And fill them up with air
I'd fly you to the stars
So we can disappear
If I could take your heart
And keep it close to me
I swear it will not break
I swear it will not bleed
And I
Believe
Just anything you say
If you would tell me to get lost
I'd ask "how far away?"
And now its getting late
And I can't keep my eyes open
My hearts open for you

I'm trusting you
And I'm taking the long way home
I'm leaving
It's not because of you
Will you just hold me tight
And never let me?
I know this whole things wrong
But baby, we're invincible

Will you just hold me tight
And never let me go?
I know this whole things wrong
But baby, we're invincible

Will you just hold me tight (I see you)
And never let me go? (I'm waiting to make my move)
I know this whole things wrong (But I'm scared and I know)
But baby, we're invincible (That you got better things to do)

I'm trusting you (If I could take these words)
And I'm taking the long way home (And fill them up with air)
I'm leaving (I'd fly you to the stars)
It's not because of you (So we can disappear)
Will you just hold me tight (If I could take your heart)
And never let me go (and keep it close to me)
I know this whole things wrong (I swear it will not break)
But baby, we're invincible (I swear it will not bleed)
