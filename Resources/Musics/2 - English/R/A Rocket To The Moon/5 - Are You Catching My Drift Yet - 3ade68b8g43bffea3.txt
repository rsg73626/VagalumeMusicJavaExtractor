ARE YOU CATCHING MY DRIFT YET

I'll leave you behind
Its not the first time
We've been through this
It happends every time
You hear the sound of my name
at the top of their lungs
And this dumb game you play
isn't fooling anyone
And now i wanna know, 
Are you catching my drift yet?
You seem to be taking control
are you catching my drift yet?

Now that we all said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you cant stand a thing I do?
And don't lie cuz we know that you want to
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that your sayin
Is not what you meant at all
Because the last time I checked
These so called "friends"
were you're "friends till the very end"

And now I know that I have made big plans
And I've said big things that have blown out of my hands 
But these hands have counted a lot and have been counted on
And now a handful is all thats left 
Can you just look at how things were
and how they are right now
And please just tell me that I am right

Just tell me why its so hard 
for you to be wrong foronce in your life 
Will it really kill you to not be right this time 

Now that we all said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you cant stand a thing I do?
And don't lie cuz we know that you want to
Now I can't seem to comprehend 
How the things that your sayin
Is not what you meant at all
Because the last time I checked
These so called "friends"
were you're "friends till the very end"
