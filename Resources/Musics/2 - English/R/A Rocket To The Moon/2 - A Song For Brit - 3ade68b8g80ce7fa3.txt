A SONG FOR BRIT

I guess I lost my breath again
It seems that time has over slept(x2)

And so am I the one that helped you out
The one you used to talk about
And said you cared for what I'd have to say
So just drink away the lies you've spilt
The bridges burned but never filled
Cus, this will never end
And those times were buried in the past, 
And who were we to think they'd last 
Cus, I just lost a friend

So wake up she said I never left
I'm here she said
But if you here then how come we don't see you anymore
There is no way that we left you
Cus we're the ones that tried so hard 
To make you see that this was all for you
We'll miss seeing you at all these shows
Reciting words from the front row
Faces fade, but memories they'll stay
And I smile at the photographs of endless nights 
And endless laughs there's nothing else to say (x2)

So wake up she said I never left
I'm here she said
But if you here then how come we don't see you anymore
There is no way that we left you
Cus were the ones that tried so hard 
To make you see that this was all for you

There is no way that we left you
Cus we're the ones that tried so hard
To make you see that this was all for you, for you
