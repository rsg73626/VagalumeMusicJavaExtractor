TEMPO

They kiss like it?s going out of style
They never leave without a smile
She cries and he wipes her cheeks
He melts whenever she speaks

Her voice is soft
Just like the wind
She lifts her head up
And holds her chin
Up so it?s facing towards the sky
She never lets time pass her by
(she never lets time pass her by)
(she never lets time pass her by)
(she never lets time pass her by)

I wrote this song and
The tempo of your windshield wipers
So when it?s raining
You won?t forget his name
(you won?t forget his name)

These stars won?t replace the colors of your eyes
We won?t stand for this, we won?t stand for this
(these stars won?t replace the color of your eyes)

I wrote this song and
The tempo of your windshield wipers
So when it?s raining
You won?t forget his name
(you won?t forget his name,
You won?t forget his name,
You won?t forget his name)
You won?t forget his name

I wrote this song and
The tempo of your windshield wipers
So when it?s raining
You won?t forget his name
(you won?t forget his name,
You won?t forget his name,
You won?t forget his name)
