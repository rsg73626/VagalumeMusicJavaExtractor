THEONE THING WITH NICK CONWAY

Is this the best that
That you can do
She said 
under her breath
then she walked away
I miss the things that you never really did
But to me those were the best times
Even if they weren't mine
I'm learning things 
I never knew about you

If there were anyting i could do to make this up to you
take my hand never let you fall never let you fall again
if there were aythign i coudl say to bring you back this way
making promises to break
fix the mess that i have made 

And now
Theres Something
I wish that I could tell you
But now I'm losing my grip
And I am falling for you
For now lets take this slow
Oh I can't let you go


If there were anyting i could do to make this up to you
take my hand never let you fall never let you fall again
if there were aythign i coudl say to bring you back this way
making promises to break
fix the mess that i have made 

I wonder why our lies became the one thing that we shared
I wish that I could be the reason why you breathe
So when it's cold outside and you exhale, i can be on your mind again


If there were anyting i could do to make this up to you
take my hand never let you fall never let you fall again
if there were aythign i coudl say to bring you back this way
making promises to break
fix the mess that i have made
