MICHELE

Come from San Diego with a suitcase and a dog
Looking for a record label job
Moving to Chicago, leave the sunshine for the fog
Leave Richard and Nancy for somewhere that we might fancy a little more
Just us and our favorite Rocket song

[refrão]
Michele, Michele
You've always loved the winter cold
Michele, Michele
You're only 22 years old
You have your whole life ahead of you

So leave your friends at Starbucks
And make your dreams come true
They'll say, "I hope the big city doesn't change her"
You'll prove them all wrong
You'll stay the same as you should do
You'll still love dogs and the taste of wrapping paper

[refrão]
