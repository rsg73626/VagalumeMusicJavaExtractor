FOOL EVERYONE

Cause we can barely talk about it
Can't go on can't live without it
Carry on without your love

Somebody give me a shot
I'm coming out ready or not
And you've been giving me signs
The chase is over, now I'm caught

Cause we can barely talk about it
Can't go on, can't live without it
Carry on without your love
We can make it out of here
We can't get caught together, dear
They're gaining on the both of us
I can feel it in your heartbeat

Mysterious love
Fool everyone, fool everyone
With a mysterious love
It's better off between us
And we'll fool everyone, fool everyone
Fool everyone, fool everyone
Mysterious love
Cause you can never quit
And I will never stop it

Somebody give me a sign
Ran out of chances, out of time
So baby give me a shot
I swear to god I'll make you mine

Cause we can barely talk about it
Can't go on, can't live without it
Carry on without your love
We can make it out of here
We can't get caught together, dear
They're gaining on the both of us
Mysterious love
Fool everyone, fool everyone
With a mysterious love
It's better off between us
And we'll fool everyone, fool everyone
Fool everyone, fool everyone
Mysterious love
Cause you can never quit
And I will never stop it

I feel you whispering, it's chilling my bones
I'm feeling something that I never used to feel on my own
Oh no, oh no
You're never gonna stop us, you'll never stop

Mysterious love
Fool everyone, fool everyone
With a mysterious love
It's better off between us
And we'll fool everyone, fool everyone
Fool everyone, fool everyone
Mysterious love
Cause you can never quit
And I will never stop it
