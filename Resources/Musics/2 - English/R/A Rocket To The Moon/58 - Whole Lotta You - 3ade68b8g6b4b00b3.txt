WHOLE LOTTA YOU

(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)

Let's go out, get lit, get loose tonight (yeah)
Sing a song, get wrong, make it feel alright
Drinks on ice, stars in our eyes
Ain't got a lot of money but you're a dime 

So, hey, hey
All I need is a whole, whole lotta you
Everyday, day is a holiday
Ain't nothing we can't do
Now all I need, baby, is a little time
And a whole lotta you

(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)

A whole lotta you

(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)

Get me buzzed on your love, lemme steal a kiss
Bubblegum on your tongue, no, I can't resist
Gotta leave all your worries at the door
'Cuz life ain't nothin' but a big dance floor

Hey, hey
All I need is a whole, whole lotta you
Everyday, day is a holiday
Ain't nothing we can't do
Now all I need, baby, is a little time
And a whole lotta you

(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)

A whole lotta you

(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)

Nobody wanna be alone, alone tonight 
So, come on, baby, take me home, to home tonight
Nobody wanna be alone, alone tonight 
So, come on, baby, take me home
(Don't cha wanna take me home?)

Nobody wanna be alone, alone tonight 
So, come on, baby, take me home, to home tonight
Nobody wanna be alone tonight 
So, come on and take me home

Hey, hey
All I need is a whole, whole lotta you
Everyday,  day is a holiday
Ain't nothing we can't do, baby

Hey, hey
All I need is a whole, whole lotta you
Everyday,  day is a holiday
Ain't nothing we can't do
Now all I need, baby, is a little time
And a whole lotta you

'Cuz all I need, baby, is a whole lotta you
And me, all night
Let's get it right

Nobody wanna be alone, so c'mon take me home
Nobody wanna be alone, be alone, baby
And no, you don't
Wanna be
Alone
Tonight
