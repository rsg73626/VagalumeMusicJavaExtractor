I BELIEVE IN US (THIS HOLIDAY)

I've been looking out my window
Watching the snow fall on the ground
The red and green from Christmas lights, hanging around town
And I wish that you could see what I'm seeing too

I've been counting down the days
Trying to get excited
Haven't heard much of the party 
So I'm probably not invited
But you won't be there so why would I wanna go

I've been good this year
The only thing I want is you to be here
All my gifts can wait
I don't believe in Santa Claus but I believe in us this holiday 

So I haven't got your letter, 
I sure hope you got my card
Though the mailman keeps saying
"Boy you're thinking way too hard"
But he doesn't know what I'm feeling now without you around

I've been good this year
The only thing I want is you to be here
All my gifts can wait
I don't believe in Santa Claus but I believe in us this holiday

I thought that I was dreaming 
When I saw you out my door
You kissed me on the lips like you have never done before
And I looked up for the mistletoe and didn't see a thing
I got just what I wanted
So what more could Santa bring

I've been good this year
The only thing I want is you to be here
All my gifts can wait
I don't believe in Santa Claus, but I believe in us this holiday
