FEAR OF FLYING

I took a picture of a girl I once knew
I kept it here in case I'd run into you
The look on your face could light up a room
But instead you left
And now I'm sitting with my head on the dashboard
Push my seat back and close my eyes
I had this dream that I was on an airplane
afraid to fly
I tipped my head to the side and I whispered
to this man that was in the isle
I said "do you know how long it takes before we die?"
and then I rolled awake

Can you take me back to the person I used to be
Back when you were there for me
I know it seems like forever but do me this favor
please
Way back when we were stupid
And Held grudges just to help us sleep
Oh my god, how ridiculous were we?

I stop your breathin' everytime I'm around girl
Your body's sweatin' and your hands start to shake
I know you can't control your eyes but I know that
your looks are fake
So tease me once and I swear I'll forget
how it feels when you've got nothing left
well take it slow and only work at it sometimes
Oh yeah

Can you take me back to the person I used to be
Back when you were there for me
I know it seems like forever but do me this favor
please
Way back when we were stupid
And held grudges just to help us sleep
Oh my god, how ridiculous were we?

I took a picture of a girl I once knew
I kept it here incase I'd run into you
Look on your face could light up a room
But instead you left
In all you left

Can you take me back to the person I used to be
Back when you were there for me
I know it seems like forever but do me this favor
please
Way back when we were stupid
And held grudges just to help us sleep
Oh my god, how ridiculous were we?
