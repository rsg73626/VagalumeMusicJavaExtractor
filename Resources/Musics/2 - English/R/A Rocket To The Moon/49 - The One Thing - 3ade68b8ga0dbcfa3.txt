THE ONE THING

Is this the best that, that you can do
She said under her breath, then she walked away

I miss the thing's that she never really did 
But to me those were the best times
Even if they weren't mine
I'm learning things I never knew about you

If there were anything I could do to make this up to you
Take my hand never let you fall, let you fall again
If there were anything I could say to bring you back this way
Making promises to break fix the mess that I have made

And now there's, there's something I wish that I could tell you
But now I'm losing my grip and I am falling for you
For now let's take this slow, oh I can let you go

If there were anything I could do to make this up to you
Take my hand never let you fall, let you fall again
If there were anything I could say to bring you back this way
Making promises to break fix the mess that I have made

I wonder why our lies because the one thing that she shared
I wondered why our lies became the one thing that we shared

I wish that I could see you.

I wonder why our lies because the one thing that she shared
I wondered why our lies became the one thing that we shared
If there were anything I could do to make this up to you
Take my hand never let you fall, let you fall again
If there were anything I could say to bring you back this way
Making promises to break fix the mess that i have made

If there were anything I could do to make this up to you 
Take my hand never let you fall, let you fall again
If there were anything I could say to bring you back this way
Making promises to break fix the mess that I have made
