EVER ENOUGH

No I'm never gonna leave you darling
No I'm never gonna go regardless
Everything inside of me is living in your heartbeat
Even when all the lights are fading
Even then if your hope was shaking
I'm here holding on

I will always be yours
Forever and more
Through the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink 'til I'm drunk
And all that I've done
Is it ever enough?

I'm hanging on a line here baby
I need more than if's and maybe's
We'll come down from the highest heights
Still searching for the reason why
And now I know what it's like
Reaching from the other side
After all that I've done

I will always be yours
Forever and more
Through the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink 'til I'm drunk
And all that I've done
Is it ever enough?

For all that it's worth, is it worth it?
Cause more than it's hard to desert it
For all that it's worth, is it worth it?
How do we know without searching?

I will write you this song to get back what's ours
Would that be enough?

I will always be yours
Forever and more
Through the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink 'til I'm drunk
And all that I've done
Is it ever enough?

For all that it's worth, is it worth it?
Is it ever enough?
How could we know without searching?
Is it ever enough?
