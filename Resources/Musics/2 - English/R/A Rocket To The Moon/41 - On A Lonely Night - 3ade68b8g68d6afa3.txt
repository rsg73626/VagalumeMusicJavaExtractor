ON A LONELY NIGHT

I was 16
Met you out in Ohio
You were 15
Living life by the mile
We laid under the stars
Fell asleep in your backyard
You said you could fly
But you'd never need to
'Cause with us you never tried to hard

On a lonely night
You will see
You're everything to me
(You've got anything)
On a lonely night
Oh, truth is
Every night is lonely without you here

We are older now
And you came back to Ohio
You whispered something to me
I haven't heard in a while
Oh, I wish I could lie
And tell you I'm fine
You wouldn't believe me if you tried
If I listen to our song
I'll be up all night

On a lonely night
You will see

You're everything to me
(You've got anything)
On a lonely night
Oh, truth is
Every night is lonely without you
Every night is lonely without you here

It's been forever
But lately it's been hard
Like when we took your parents car
And drove forever in the dark
I'd give it all away if I could
See you once again
And have a summer love
Growing close
We'll never grow up

On a lonely night
You will see
You're everything to me
(You've got anything)
On a lonely night
Oh, truth is
Every night is lonely without you
Every night is lonely without you here
Every guy will be lonely without you there
