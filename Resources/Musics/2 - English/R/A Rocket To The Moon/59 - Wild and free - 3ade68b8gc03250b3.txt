WILD AND FREE

She was young
And her daddy didn't warn her
She had stars in her eyes
And she never gave up on California

He was old
And not much of a dreamer
But he knew what she wanted
And there's nothing he could say that would keep her

Sometimes, we gotta make up our own minds
And say

We can sing right along with the thunder
We can be who we wanna be
And we'll never have to worry or wonder
The only thing we gotta believe
Is that we'll live while we're young
And we'll do it 'cuz we're wild and free

He was told
He was never gonna make it
He was wasting his time and his money
On the chances he was taking

Sometimes, we gotta make up our own minds
And say

We can sing right along with the thunder
We can be who we wanna be
And we'll never have to worry or wonder
The only thing we gotta believe
Is that we'll live while we're young
And we'll do it 'cuz we're wild and free

We get no time for a second chance
Free
We're gonna find our way and never look back

We can sing right along with the thunder
We can be who we wanna be
And we'll never have to worry or wonder
The only thing we gotta believe
Is that we can't stop now or we're never gonna see
Everything you want and everything you need
We'll live while we're young
And we'll do it 'cuz we're wild and free
(Alright)
Wild and free
Wild and free
