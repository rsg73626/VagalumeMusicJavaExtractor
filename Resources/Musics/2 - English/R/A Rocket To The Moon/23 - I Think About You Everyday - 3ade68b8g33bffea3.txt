I THINK ABOUT YOU EVERYDAY

Oh girls these nights are dull
I wish that i could spend them with you
I'm looking at this wall
Repeating "girl i love you"
Just take your pick
They're all the same
These things that you are telling me
can't really show me how you feel
I'm breaking down
I'm falling down
But now I'm breathing
And now I am scared to move
Dont listen to a word I tell you
Just take me by my hand
And I swear I'll make this up to you

So now you want me to fix everything
But baby theres so much and so little time to
Replace the things I've broken
Ripped apart, and thrown away
You can say that you dont miss me
I think about you every day

Oh come on girl
There's so much to say
So instead of kidding everybody
How bout you try your tricks on me
on me.

So now you want me to fix everything
But baby theres so much and so little time to
Replace the things I've broken
Ripped apart, and thrown away
You can say that you dont miss me
I think about you every day

Oh...
Oh,
Do you know
How this feels to see your face when I close my eyes
Bet you know
How it feels to be the only thing that matters now

So now you want me to fix everything
But baby theres so much and so little time to
Replace the things I've broken
Ripped apart, and thrown away
You can say that you dont miss me
I think about you every day
So now you want me to fix everything
But baby theres so much and so little time to
Replace the things I've broken
Ripped apart, and thrown away
You can say that you dont miss me
I think about you every day
