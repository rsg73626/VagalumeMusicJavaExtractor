I'LL BE YOUR SUNSET

Case closed
I'm not here anymore
I'm not scared anymore
The way you walked away
I could tell you weren't afraid
To do the things you had to do
Even though I meant so much to you

But darling where you going
It's so cold outside
I know that I cant be concerned
But your still in my life
(But your still in my life)

When I am miles away
Will you still check on me
Someday things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
Its in the dreams I had
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
(You'll be my silhouette)

Just take my hand and well
Never let go because
If were together now
Well be together then
Step back and see me walk away
Then watch me run right back
I'll show you how to love again
This is the best idea I've had
(This is the best idea I've had)

When I am miles away
Will you still check on me
Someday things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
Its in the dreams I had
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
(You'll be my silhouette)

I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette

When I am miles away
Will you still check on me
Someday things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
Its in the dreams I had
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
(You'll be my silhouette)

When I am miles away
Will you still check on me
Someday things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
Its in the dreams I had
I'll be your sunset
You'll be my silhouette
(You'll be my silhouette)
