WHILE THE WORLD LET GO

I said don't go
I need you here
Just hold me close
Until the coast is clear

And I will fall
I'll fall so hard
In hopes I land
In your arms
We can watch the world go by
Falling like stars in the sky

(Whoa, oh)
I'm never gonna let you go
(Whoa, oh)
Your love's gonna save my soul
And after all we've been through
Fire and smoke
And through it all
We've kept a hold of hope
While the world let go

If the moon
Doesn't come
And we're left
Without the sun

I will still
Hold you tight
We'll wait
Out the night
We can watch the world go by
Falling like stars in the sky

(Whoa, oh)
I'm never gonna let you go
(Whoa, oh)
Your love's gonna save my soul
And after all we've been through
Fire and smoke
And through it all
We've kept a hold of hope
While the world let go

(While the world let go)
While the world let go
(While the world let go)

I swore I'd never let you
End up on your own
I'll always be around to let you
Know

I'm never gonna let you go
Your love's gonna save my soul
And after all we've been through
Fire and smoke
And through it all
We've kept a hold of hope
While the world let go

(While the world let go)
While the world let go
(While the world let go)
While the world let go

I swore I'd never let you go
