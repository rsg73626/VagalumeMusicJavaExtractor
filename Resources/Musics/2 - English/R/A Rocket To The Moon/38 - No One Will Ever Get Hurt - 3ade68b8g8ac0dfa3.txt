NO ONE WILL EVER GET HURT

She keeps me up after late phone calls
Dreaming of her arms around me
Well I think she's beautiful
She thinks I'm going blind

I could spend my life tryin' to write this song
And I could spend my time tryin' to right my wrongs
Oh, she's worth it
She says that I'm the one

And no one can love you like I can honey
We gatta make this work
Cos when I get to runnin',
You get to thinkin' that one of us is gonna get hurt.

We could walk around this town like we own the world
But everybody bows at your feet.
They think you're crazy, girl
Well, crazy for a guy like me

When I'm gone
You're the only one I want
When I'm here
You're the only one I need

And no one can love you like I can honey
We gatta make this work
Cos when I get to runnin',
You get to thinkin' that one of us is gonna get hurt.

You're right, girl
Well I don't know what's wrong with me
Cos you need somebody
And I need some growing up.
You're the one who's gonna get hurt.

And no one can love you like I can honey
We gatta make this work
Cos when I get to runnin',
You get to thinkin' that one of us is gonna get
You're gonna get hurt.

You're right, girl.
Well I don't know what's wrong with me
And you need somebody
And I need some growing up
You're the one that said that I need somebody
And you need some growing to
So no one will ever get hurt
