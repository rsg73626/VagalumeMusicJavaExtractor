IF ONLY THEY KNEW

Talk to me
I'm torn
I could get lost in a voice like yours
Tell me if I'm wrong or right
Tell me I could stay tonight

It's in the way that you fool everyone
When you're falling in love again
So tell me how this ends...

'Cause no one knows you like I do
They don't see you like I do, baby
They'll try to, Oh if only they knew
They'll never come close to you

Girl you know you got it,
Oh you know you do it better
(Girl you know you got it,
Oh, you know you do it better)
And girl you know I want it,
Oh, I want it more then ever!
(Girl you know I want it, oh I know it's now or never)

'Cause no one loves you more then I do
They don't see you like I do, baby
They'll try to, Oh if only they knew
They'll never come close to you
They'll never come close to you

And you brighten up the world
With your eyes
And you're so damn lonely,
When you're on my mind
'Cause you're the only one...

'Cause no one knows you like I do
They don't see you like I do, baby
They'll try to, Oh if only they knew
They'll never come close to you
They'll never come close to you
They'll try to, Oh if only they knew
They'll never come close to you
