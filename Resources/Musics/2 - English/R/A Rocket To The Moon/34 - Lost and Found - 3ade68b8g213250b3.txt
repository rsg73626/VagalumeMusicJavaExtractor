LOST AND FOUND

Old man on his way back home late from work today
Far out on a dirt road, he couldn't find his way
With tears in his eyes he knew there's no one in sight
And tried to tell himself that it'll be alright

Why's it always darkest right before the dawn?
If liars can be honest, and right can be wrong
When you find a doorway, are you in or are you out?
You have to stand up before you fall down
You need to get lost before you get found

Young girl with a broken heart walking home alone
Teardrops made of Maybelline on a goodbye note
And looking down at the shadows on the ground
She almost didn't see
A blue eyed man with a flower in his hand
Walking right out of her dreams
And she said

Why's it always darkest right before the dawn?
If liars can be honest and right can be wrong
When you find a doorway, are you in or are you out?
You have to stand up before you fall down
You need to get lost before you get found

We're never gonna know it all
Like houses we will fall
And break in stormy weather
And be put back together better
We're never gonna know the way
Never gonna know which words to say
And don't you worry it'll be okay

Why's it always stormy right before the calm?
Why are we so lonely before it's said and done?
Why's it always darkest right before the dawn?
If liars can be honest, and right can be wrong
And when you find a doorway, are you in or are you out?
You have to stand up before you fall down
You need to get lost before you get found
