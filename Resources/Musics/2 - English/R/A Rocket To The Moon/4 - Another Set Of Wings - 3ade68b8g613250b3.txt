ANOTHER SET OF WINGS

I keep staring at your door from down the hallway
Tonight I couldn't make it to the moon
Looking at our pictures on the fireplace
Wishing it was me instead of you
It gets harder everyday but I keep on holding on

There's an angel looking out for me
Because I ain't well
Though I try to be
I'm dancing all alone
'Cause I can hear you sing
I need my angel
Like heaven needs another set of wings

Lately I just keep my windows open
Hoping I might feel you in the wind
Time heals all, but somehow I'm still broken
'Cause parts of me ain't ever gonna mend

There's an angel looking out for me
'Cause I ain't well
Though I try to be
I'm dancing all alone
'Cause I can hear you sing
I need my angel
Like heaven needs another set of wings

I'm still missing you
I'm still missing you

There's an angel looking out for me
'Cause I ain't well
Though I try to be
I'm dancing all alone
'Cause I can hear you sing
I need my angel

There's an angel looking out for me
'Cause I ain't well
Though I try to be
I'm dancing all alone
'Cause I can hear you sing
I need my angel
Like heaven needs another set of wings
