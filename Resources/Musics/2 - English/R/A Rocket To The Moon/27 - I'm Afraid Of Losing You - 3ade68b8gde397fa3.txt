I'M AFRAID OF LOSING YOU

I don't know how to speak for anyone but myself. You see darling there is nothing I can say that will save you anyways
I'll scream loud at the top of my lungs tonight, 
'Cause you know you will always be my light, Shooting stars could never be this bright 
Do you know you will always be my light? 

Screaming out your name, I'm not used to this, 
There's no turning back, there's no going home
I won't breathe until you just tell me everything is alright, 
I am not scared of losing this, 
I'm afraid of losing you, 
I'm sorry that this will not end, 
But I can't find the strength to speak, 
'Cause on the calender of your events I'm last week...

Keep your eyes closed and we'll make it through
Another day alive, but if we sit here thinking we are just wasting precious time
So instead of thinking that we're dead let's take apart what we have left, 
Lay it out in front of us and take the things that we don't trust.. 

Screaming out your name, I'm not used to this, There's no turning back, there's no going home.. 

I wont breath until you just tell me everything's
alright, 
I am not scared of losing this 
I'm afraid of losing you 
I'm sorry that this will not end 
But I can't find the strength to speak 
'Cause on the calender of your events 
I'm last week... 

I don't know how to speak for anyone but myself. You see darling there is nothing I can say that will save you anyways
I won't breath until you tell me everything is alright,

I'm not scared of losing this 
I'm afraid of losing you 
I'm sorry this will not end 
But I can't find the strength to speak cause on the calender of your events 
I'm last week... 

Darling there's nothing I can say that'll save you
anyways
