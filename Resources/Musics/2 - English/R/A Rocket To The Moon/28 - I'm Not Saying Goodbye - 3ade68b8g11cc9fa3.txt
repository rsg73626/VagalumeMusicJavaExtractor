I'M NOT SAYING GOODBYE

I've painted these walls a million times
I drove so far to say these lines
The only thing i wanted was with you

And I've packed my bags, yeah I'll be fine
i've made some calls, I've said goodbye
She'll see me in a couple days
She'll wipe the smile off my face.

You're not looking yourself today,
I can see it in the way that your hands shake
And you know that you're no good for no one else but me love
And you're trying not to act so cute
With your hands in your pocket and one on your locket
Show me something new

I'm writing down your favorite things
To show you that I've read through your letter again
As pages fall, my heart falls too
You cross your t's and dot your i's
I'm not saying goodbye

I've been sleeping with the lights on baby
I know it drives you crazy, tonight I swear we'll be alone

But damn girl is it so obvious, that I'm out of luck and we're out of time
So tonight you'll be all mine

I'm writing down your favorite things
To show you that I've read through your letter again
As pages fall, my heart falls too
You cross your t's and dot your i's
I'm not saying goodbye

I've been sleeping with the lights on
I've been sleeping with the lights on
I've been sleeping with the lights on baby
I've been sleeping with the lights on baby
I know it drives you crazy, tonight i swear we'll be alone

I'm writing down your favorite things
To show you that I've read through your letter again
As pages fall, my heart falls too
You cross your t's and dot your i's
I'm not saying goodbye
