COPS AND ROBBERS

Do you need
Me at night?
When you're warm
In your bed
Do you see
What went wrong
When I look
In your eyes
Now darling
Don't be worried
When you're sleeping on your own tonight

Don't wait
Cuz you'll just waste your time
You never listen to
Anything I have to say
Cuz now I'm believing the things that I'm lying about
Tonight babe
Cuz in a heartbeat we changed so fast
And now the stars are aligning
And the moon is setting
And I will be the best damn constellation
That's in your sky tonight

Now darling I am scared
And there's worry in the air
But I'm not accusing anyone
But myself
But there's something that I
Gotta get off my chest
So here it goes

Don't wait
Cuz you'll just waste your time
You never listen to
Anything I have to say
Cuz now I'm believing the things that I'm lying about
Tonight babe
Cuz in a heartbeat we changed so fast
And now the stars are aligning
And the moon is setting
And I will be the best damn constellation
That's in your sky tonight

(Do you see all these stars or do they still hurt your eyes)
