FIRST KISS

I pulled up to a drive, I tightened up my tie 
I need to make her wait 
No sleep from the night before
Her dad answers the front door and already knows my name
I stand in fear as she gets near
Then everything is ok
I hope this feeling never goes away

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch, we can't resist
We go back to our first day, our first kiss

Her face lit by the movie screen
She's leaning into me and time seems to slip away
Later on we take a walk and good thing she likes to talk 
'Cause I can't think of what to say
She looks at me and she can see the chance I wanna take
She moves in close and takes my breath away

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch, we can't resist
We go back to our first day, our first kiss

Everytime feels like the first time
Looking back on what we had, it never went away
She still makes me feel it every day

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch, we can't resist
We go back to our first day, our first kiss
