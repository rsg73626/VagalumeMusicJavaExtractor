ON YOUR SIDE

I know your face, your eyes, your lips, your taste
I love the way you know just what to say

It was a saturday
Remember it like yesterday
She knew my name, imagine that
I know this road, the way that no one goes

So cold, so cold
Baby you're so cold, so cold

Take it easy baby, we can make it right
Girl, you know my love is always on your side
Rest your eyes tonight
You know that my love
You know that my love is on your side

I love your pretty face
And how it rests on your pillow case
We'd get in fights, you spend the night
And I don't see how we get this way
I think we're alright

So cold, so cold
Baby you're so cold, so cold

Take it easy baby, we can make it right
Girl, you know my love is always on your side
Rest your eyes tonight
You know that my love
You know that my love is on your side

Take it easy baby, we can make it right
Girl, you know my love is always on your side
Rest your eyes tonight
Rest your eyes tonight
Rest your eyes tonight
You know that my love is on your side
You know that my love
You know that my love is on your side
You know that my love is on your side
