YOU'RE MY SONG

I grew up on the Beatles
And you were raised on the Stones
You're a little bit country, yeah
And I play rock and roll

The first time that I saw you
I remembered every word you said
Now you're stuck like a melody playing over in my head
That I don't want to forget

'Cause you're my song
My sweet home Alabama
I can sing you all night long
You're my red red wine
Learning to fly
'Cause you're my song
You're my song

I'll be your good vibration
You'll be my Penny Lane
Don't need a radio station
To dance with Mary Jane

'Cause you're my song
My sweet home Alabama
I can sing you all night long
You're my red red wine
Learning to fly
'Cause you're my song
You're my song

Just want to hear you talk
So turn the stereo off
I want to turn you on

'Cause you're my song
My sweet home Alabama
I can sing you all night long
You're my red red wine
Learning to fly
Baby we were born to run
'Cause you're my song
You're my song

You're my song
You're my song
