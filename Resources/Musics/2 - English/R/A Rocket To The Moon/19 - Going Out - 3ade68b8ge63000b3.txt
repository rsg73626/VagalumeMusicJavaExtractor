GOING OUT

We are always trying to find a way to get back home
Party like it was '99
Howling at the moon
'cause we get loud a little while when we go out
Took a yellow taxi home that night after closing time
And drove around with one headlight 'til the driver lost his mind
'cause we get loud  a little while when we go out
Forget about what they say when all is said and done
We won't remember anyway when the morning comes

When we go out, we can get crazy
We can go all night
Everyone's our best friend
Everything's alright
Let's go out, let's get crazy
Maybe's not allowed
Drop everything you have that gets you down
'cause we're going out

Johnny met a girl one night
And planned a night alone
So we thought that we'd just drop by
And let them both know
We get loud a little while, so we're going out
Forget about what they say when all is said and done
We won't remember anyway when the morning comes

When we go out, we can get crazy
We can go all night
Everyone's our best friend
Everything's alright
Let's go out, let's get crazy
Maybe's not allowed
Drop everything you have that gets you down
'cause we're going out

So if you want to stay out late and keep the town alive
Talk about the friends we make and make some more tonight
Let's get loud a little while, let's go out
'cause we get loud a little while, when we go out

When we go out, we can get crazy
We can go all night
Everyone's our best friend
Everything's alright
Let's go out, let's get crazy
Maybe's not allowed
Drop everything you have that gets you down
Drop everything you have that gets you down
'cause we're going out
