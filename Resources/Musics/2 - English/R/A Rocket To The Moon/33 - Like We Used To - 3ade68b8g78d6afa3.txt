LIKE WE USED TO

I can feel her breath as she's sleeping next to me
Sharing pillows and cold feet
She can feel my heart fell asleep to its beat
Under blankets and warm sheets

If only I could be in that bed again
If only it were only it were me instead of him

Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts 
When you've seen it a million times?
Does he sing to all your music 
While you dance to "Purple Rain?"
Does he do all these things, like I used to?

Fourteen months and seven days ago
Oh, I know you know
How we felt about that night
Just your skin against the window
Oh, we took it slow
And we both know

It should've been me inside that car
It should've been me instead of him in the dark

Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts 
When you've seen it a million times?
Does he sing to all your music 
While you dance to "Purple Rain?"
Does he do all these things, like I used to?

I know, love, I'm a sucker for that feeling
Happens all the time, love, 
I always end up feeling cheated
You're on my mind, love, 
I told you I don't when I need it
It happens all the time, love, yeah

Will he love you like I loved you?
Will he tell you everyday?
Will he make you feel like you're invincible
With every word he'll say?
Can you promise me if this was right:
Don't throw it all away?
Can you do all these things?
Will you do all these things?
Like we used to?
Oh, like we used to...
