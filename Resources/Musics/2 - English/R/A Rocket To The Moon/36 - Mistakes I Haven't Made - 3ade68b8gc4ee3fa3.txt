MISTAKES I HAVEN'T MADE

Watch these stars
I've watched the sky
I watch your world
fall in your eyes
I'll hold you close
I'll kiss your neck,
I'll make you weak with this dialect i speak.

We're taking everything for granted
Replacing everything with heavy hearts
Now I'm losing my mind
And losing everything I've had

Stay awake, I've found the answers
To everything you've ever asked
I'm cleaning up mistakes I've made
And replacing them with ones I've not made yet

we won't let this fall apart
I'm not leaving this alone
I thought forever meant forever
Not tomorrow or today

Close your eyes, we'll fly away
It will come back home someday (x2)

Stay awake, I've found the answers
To everything you've ever asked
I'm cleaning up mistakes I've made
And replacing them with ones I've not made yet(x3)
