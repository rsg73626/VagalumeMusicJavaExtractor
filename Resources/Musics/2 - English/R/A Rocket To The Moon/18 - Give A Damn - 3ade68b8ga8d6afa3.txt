GIVE A DAMN

He takes a drag and rolls his window down
and then they both laugh loud at something she just said.
He's in need of inspiration he's starved for her
attention
and she can't help but look good.
Her eyes are holding back tears
cause it's been like this for two whole years
Bitting her lip and rolling her eyes
he can't stand it but he acts surprised

And they're doing nothing but it feels like something
even though they're doing nothing tonight.

She can't stand you, you don't know why
but it kills you deep inside
He's yearning, she is learning now
how it feels to be alive

(bitting her lip, and rolling her eyes
he can't stand it, but he still acts surprised.)

He wanted more than she could give
even gave up and then she did.
But does he really want to stop
I mean, did he really think this through.

She can't stand you, you don't know why
but it kills you deep inside
He's yearning, she is learning now
how it feels to be alive

Open your eyes and listen to him
he is singing things to make you
think about him, dream about him
He wants you but he can't have you.

She can't stand you, you don't know why
but it kills you deep inside
He's yearning, she is learning now
how it feels to be alive

He's misleading you, remember how it takes him
a few 'I'm sorry's and late night visits
to show you how he really feels
