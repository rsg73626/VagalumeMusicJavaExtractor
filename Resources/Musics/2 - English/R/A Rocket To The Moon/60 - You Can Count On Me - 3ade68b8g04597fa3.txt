YOU CAN COUNT ON ME

Dear sweetie this is my first time, 
Talking about this, 
And I must tell you this 
There's a place where you can come and stay, whenever you can get away. 
This place is warm and sits inside my chest. 
It sits inside my chest 

You can count on me 
To wake you up today and tell you that it's all okay 
And tell you what you like to hear just keep me here, 
Just keep me here. 

The stars are out tonight my dear 
Have you ever seen them so clear. 
If I could I would take you up, 
To take one down 
I'll turn your world around. 
I’d show you what it’d be like to have it all. 
I’d show you what it’d be like to have it all. 
So when we kiss it’d be something we’ll forget, 
So every time we do it we’ll feel the same again. 
Now I can’t wait to see everything you have to show 
So now I cant wait to see you again, 
To see you again. 

You can count on me 
To wake you up today and tell you that it's all okay 
And tell you what you want to hear just keep me here, 
Just keep me here.
