FIVE FOUR THREE TWO

I feel alone in a world full of strangers And I cant sit still.
Cause this has been eating me all for about 7 months but only 5 remain
This year has gone by and I haven't moved and I haven't said anything
The words cant find a way to leave my lips, Or leave me alone
Stay close stay warm stay here stay here oh Please
I want you, I need you
Just tell me you wont leave for heaven sake Will you just tell me
I'm not the best at waiting but I'll give it All I've got.

I'm the best and worst idea I think you've Ever had
Just in case you don't believe me I've
Written everything on paper just confirm did Say does that dumb word love mean anything?

By the way I miss your eyes miss your smile And the way you used to wake me up but now I'm falling down.

Stay close stay warm stay here oh please I Want you I need you
just tell me you wont Leave for heaven sakes will you just tell me
I'm not the best at waiting but I'll give it All I've got

Stay close stay warm stay here oh please I Want you I need you
just tell me you wont Leave for heaven sakes will you just tell me I'm not the best at waiting but I'll give it All I've got
