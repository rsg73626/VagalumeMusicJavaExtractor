AWAY, AWAY

He takes a breath
And she wants to leave
And he cant wait to show her things that shes never seen before

But the weather is cold now
And shes still wrapped up in things that can keep her warm
Unlike him hes the one that would heat up the winter air to keep her close

Away away
Now we'll get away
We keep on retaking the photographs they will never change
The way we kiss goodbye
The way we hold our hands
The way we walk alone
The way we have no plan
This is something I'd like to forget

These numbers repeat themselves
These phonecalls have no destination
Im dialing just anything to hear your voice tonight
Im desperate for your attention
Im all ears, and I hear nothing

Now the phone call is over
And im still wrapped up in things I have said before

Away away
Now we'll get away
We keep on retaking the photographs they will never change
The way we kiss goodbye
The way we hold our hands
The way we walk alone
The way we have no plan
This is something id like to forget
Away away, away away
Away away, away away

Youre not perfect sport, and let me save you the suspence
This girl you met, she isnt perfect either
But the question is, are you perfect for eachother?
Thats the whole deal, thats what intimacy is all about
Nobody knows the answer in the whole world,
But the only way to find out is by giving it a shot.

Away away
Now we'll get away
We keep on retaking the photographs they will never change
The way we kiss goodbye
The way we hold our hands
The way we walk alone
The way we have no plan
This is something I'd like to forget
