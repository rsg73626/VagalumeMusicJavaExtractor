MR. RIGHT

My girlfriend's got a boyfriend funny
He doesn't make a dime all day
And all her girlfriends' boyfriends make money
What more can I say?

It's true
He never made it through a day of school
The only thing he studied was you
He knows your body better than you do

Maybe I'm your Mr. Right
Baby, maybe I'm the wrong you like
Maybe I'm a shot in the dark
and you're the morning light

Maybe this is sad but true
Baby, maybe you've got nothing to lose
You could be the best of me
when I'm the worst for you

My girlfriend's got a boyfriend running
to catch the bus to meet
to meet up with the boyfriend's girlfriend who's stunning
She's such a sight to see

It's true
The moment he laid eyes on you
He knew, the only wish he wanted came true
He knows he's lucky that he met someone like you

Maybe I'm your Mr. Right
Baby, maybe I'm the wrong you like
Maybe I'm a shot in the dark
and you're the morning light

Maybe this is sad but true
Baby, maybe you've got nothing to lose
You could be the best of me
when I'm the worst for you

You always change your mind
and you can't change mine
(No, you can't change mine)

Maybe I'm your Mr. Right
Baby, maybe I'm the wrong you like
Maybe I'm a shot in the dark
and you're the morning light

Maybe this is sad but true
Baby, maybe you've got nothing to lose
You could be the best of me
when I'm the worst for you
I'm the worst for you
