NOTHING AT ALL

Yeah, you might have somebody
No, but you don't got me
Oh, but your thinkin' 'bout it
Yeah, it's so easy to see
I won't tell nobody
Nobody's gonna tell on me
We both know it baby
Exactly what this could be

But sometimes you can't hide
The way you feel inside

Your love is the only thing
I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it?
How did I ever live without it?
Without your lovin'
A little bit of lovin'
Beats a whole lot of nothing at all

You've got this thing about you
And that thing is just what I need
You deserve a little something better
And I'll be waiting patiently
I've been thinking 'bout our life together
Even if it's the death of me
And I know I'll never live forever
But I don't wanna wait and see

But sometimes you can't hide
The way you feel inside

Your love is the only thing
I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it?
How did I ever live without it?
Without your lovin'
A little bit of lovin'
Beats a whole lot of nothing at all

I could be
The only thing that you'd ever need
I could be
Something that you don't wanna leave
Let me be the one that's gonna make you believe
That you were really made for me

Your love is the only thing
I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it?
How did I ever live without it?
Without your lovin'

Your love is the only thing
I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it?
How did I ever live without it?
Without your lovin'
A little bit of lovin'
Beats a whole lot of nothing at all
