CALL IT ALL HOME

It started back then in the summer '07
Making music in the old garage
Jumped in the jeep drove out to arizona
Where we met a couple friends of ours
It was something in the water
'cause now it's getting harder and nothing's gonna stop us now
With the soul cal drummer
Dania's little brother now we're making our parents proud

There's a town in california where we keep our friends around
Made our way to arizona never turned the party down
And out in massachusetts is where we meet up to hit the road
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home

Drove out to burbank thought
We should sure take advantage of the winter time
Made a record and a plan, packed up the van
And it died every hundred miles
We almost got caught but we fooled the cops
With a vegan in snake skinned boots
Made it to philly drank a beer
With a really cool dad who liked to get loose

There's a town in california where we keep our friends around
Made our way to arizona never turned the party down
And out in massachusetts is where we meet up to hit the road
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home
Yeah we call it all home

Spent the day of with johnny and josh
Making work seem more like fun
In arlington heights, we stayed the night
Getting woken up by the sun
Out on the road wherever we go we never feel too alone
Making vans and hotels feel like home

Until we're back in california where we keep our friends around
Make our way to arizona never turned the party down
And out in massachusetts when we meet up to hit the road
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home
Yeah we call it all home
And we call it all home
