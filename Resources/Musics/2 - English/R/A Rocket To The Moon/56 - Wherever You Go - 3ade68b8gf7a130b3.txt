WHEREVER YOU GO

An hour away from home
And time's never felt this slow
It feels like a week ago
Do you feel it too?

I bet you went back to bed
My pillow overneath your head
Repeating last words I've said
I miss you

You're all I need
So fall back to sleep

Wherever I go, wherever I'll be
Oh I just hope that you're thinkin' 'bout me
And that you don't doubt my love if you're lonely
Wherever you go, whatever you see
You're not alone, you never will be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be

I saw you in Thompson Square
The wind playing in your hair
You never bend

And now everywhere I go
It feels like I'm coming home
I'll see you in a month or so
But until then

You're all I need
And all I see

Wherever I go, wherever I'll be
Oh I just hope that you're thinkin' 'bout me
And that you don't doubt my love if you're lonely
Wherever you go, whatever you see
You're not alone, you never will be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be

Wherever I go, wherever I'll be
Oh I just hope that you're thinkin' 'bout me
And that you don't doubt my love if you're lonely
Wherever you go, whatever you see
You're not alone, you never will be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be
