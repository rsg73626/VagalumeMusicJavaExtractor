I'LL BE BACK SOON

Just make sure to not wake me up.
So that you can leave and i can't make you stay.
You're pictures are hanging on the wall.
I'm waiting for them to fall.
I'm watching the world fall to pieces on the floor.
And there's nothing i can do.
There's nothing i can do,
But to build it up and watch it fall again.
Again.

I'll say farewell to the world behind.
As i drive into the night.
I'll make all this up to you.
I promise i'll be back soon.
I'm writing this whole thing down to show you that this is the truth.
I can't keep a secret.
I'll be all right.
I won't be home tonight.

I'm not waiting for you to be there when i get back from this long ride.
There's so much i want to say.
But you won't listen.
You never listen to me.
To me.

I'll say farewell to the world behind.
As i drive into the night.
I'll make all this up to you.
I promise i'll be back soon.
I'm writing this whole thing down to show you that this is the truth.
I can't keep a secret.
I'll be allright.
I won't be home tonight.

I saw everything there's to see.
I didn't see you and me.
And since that this night is through.
I just want to be with you.
She's waited for so long.
So how can this be wrong.

I'll say farewell to the world behind.
As i drive into the night.
I'll make all this up to you.
I promise i'll be back soon.
I'm writing this whole thing down to show you that this is the truth.
I can't keep a secret.
I'll be allright.
I won't be home tonight.

Just make sure not to wake me up.
There's so much i want to say but you
Won't listen.
So that you can leave and i can't make you stay.
You never listen to me.
