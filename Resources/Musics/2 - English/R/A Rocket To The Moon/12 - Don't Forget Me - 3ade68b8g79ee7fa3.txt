DON'T FORGET ME

Lock the door and meet me in here
I'm not, I'm not scared
Goodbye, say goodbye
Farewell my one and only

We were meant for this
And we were made for this
We won't mess it up cause we always just fall down
Well never miss another day cause were the ones who writes the songs
And the writers lost his touch he doesnt't care for this at all

I won't stand for this
I won't stand for this
I won't stand for this
I won't stand for this

So kiss me gently
Cause I'll never let it go
I bet you never thought that this was how the song goes
And while your listening, I am really trying
The words I never said will keep your eyes from crying
(the words I never said will keep your eyes from crying)

I won't sit here waiting
Would you stay for me?
I can't wait forever
Will you take that long?

This isn't what I'm waiting for
This isn't what I'm here for
This isn't what I'm waiting for
This isn't what I'm here for

So kiss me gently
I'll never let it go
(repeat)

So kiss me gently
Cause I'll never let it go
I bet you never thought that this was how the song goes
And while your listening, I am really trying
The words I never said will keep your eyes from crying

This is the way it was, the way it is, it should be
We fell in love with one another like the movies
And well both realize that we can both be happy
I won't forget you and I hope you won't forget me
(repeat)

This is the way it was, the way it is, it should be

I'll never let it go
