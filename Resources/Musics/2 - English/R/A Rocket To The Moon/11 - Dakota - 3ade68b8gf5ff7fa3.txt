DAKOTA

She knows exactly what to do, whenever I'm alone with her.
I can barely make a move by the time she opens up her eyes.

She sings to me at night.
She singing: Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
I know that she barely knows me, and I'm fake in love with her.
It's like I'm singing karaoke, and I forgot the second verse.
But I can make up my own words.

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new.
I barely know you. I've fallen over you.
It's the way you do the things you do that make me
fall in love with you.
Oh Dakota, are you in love with me too?

She's got a little bit of money and a little bit of this and its all she needs to live.
I've got a little bit of love and a little bit of that and it's all I have to give.
This time, I'll try not to show that I am not letting go.

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new.
I barely know you. I've fallen over you.
Oh Dakota, are you in love with me too?

I'll show you I'll show you and you'll know that I'm not letting go.
I'll show you I'll show you and you'll know I'm not letting go.

Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba ba da ba ba [x2]

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new.
I barely know you. I've fallen over you.
It's the way you do the things you do that make me
fall in love with you.
Oh Dakota, are you in love with me too?

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new.
I barely know you. I've fallen over you.
It's the way you do the things you do that make me
fall in love with you.
Oh Dakota, are you in love with me too.
I'm in love with you, are you in love with me too?
