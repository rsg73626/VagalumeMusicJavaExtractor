WHEN I'M GONE

The telephone is ringing in the afternoon
I was talking to your mother about you
Yeah we were talking 'bout you
She said you were in the garden where the sunshine blooms
I can see you in the front lawn

When I'm gone, my heart is with you
And when I'm gone, my heart is with you
And I know, I know I'll always be thinking, thinking about
I hope you know I always call you my home

It don't matter where I'm going or what I do
I always come back, I always come back to you
And I've got this funny feeling that I'll be seeing you soon
I always come home, I always come home to you

I live by the freeway on a fabric bench
I wonder when the next that time I'll be fed
I'm fed up, I'm fed up with this
You're probably sleeping in your plastic house
I can see you in the front room

When I'm gone, my heart is with you
And when I'm gone, my heart is with you
And I know, I know I'll always be thinking, thinking about
I hope you know I always call you my home

It don't matter where I'm going or what I do
I always come back, I always come back to you
And I've got this funny feeling that I'll be seeing you soon
I always come home, I always come home to you

And I know, I know I'll always be thinking, thinking about
I hope you know I'll always call you my home

It don't matter where I'm going or what I do
I always come back, I always come back to you
And I've got this lovely feeling that I'll be seeing you soon
'Cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home to you
