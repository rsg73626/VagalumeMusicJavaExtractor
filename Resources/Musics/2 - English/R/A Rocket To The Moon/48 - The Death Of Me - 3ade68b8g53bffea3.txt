THE DEATH OF ME

These words
This heart
Have hurt a lot
I know 
I'm wrong
This will not stop
I've said so many things
A lot that I regret but
Words will be the death of me 
Mark them now and hold your peace

I am
running away from...
This is 
something I won't regret
And now I'm burning down
The bridges I have found
To keep you from getting to me again

So I'll just sit inside
And write these stupid songs
I have no reason why
I do this
I guess It's for the fun
And not all just for you
Someone just tell me
I'm dying to find out 

I am
running away from...
This is 
something I won't regret 
And now I'm burning down
The bridges I have found
To keep you from getting to me again

I am
running away from...
This is 
something I won't regret
And now I'm burning down
The bridges I have found
To keep you from getting to me again
