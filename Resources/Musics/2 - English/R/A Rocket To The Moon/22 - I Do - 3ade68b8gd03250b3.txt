I DO

You get lost on your way back home
Just about anywhere
You sing off key to the radio
Like nobody's there
And I love that your Sunday's best
Is a holey pair of jeans
And I don't stand a chance when you smile

Yeah, the longer that we're together
The good keeps on getting better
I never thought that I would ever
Find someone like you
And every day you show me I can
Just when I think that I can't
Love you any more than I do
I do

You change your hair color every week
Cause you're never quite sure of it
And I know when you're mad at me
Cause you tell me what I did
And all I think is beautiful
When I think of you
And I still can't believe that you're mine

Yeah, the longer that we're together
The good keeps on getting better
I never thought that I would ever
Find someone like you
And every day you show me I can
Just when I think that I can't
Love you any more than I do
I do
I do

All I see is beautiful
When I look at you

Yeah, the longer that we're together
The good keeps on getting better
I never thought that I would ever
Find someone like you
And every day you show me I can
Just when I think that I can't
Love you any more than I do
I can't love you any more than I do
I do
I do
