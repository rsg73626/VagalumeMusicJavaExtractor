ALL THAT BITE

As loud as your stilettos
Hitting the pavement
The night you walked away
Me breaking in the rain

The concrete was your soundboard
Booming with each step
The street we won't forget
The street we won't forget

Forever yours, forever yours
Forever yours, forever yours

Color me mine mug
such a sublime hug
People watching in the park till after dark
Sand gets everywhere
but we do not care
We were there, we were there

1, 2, 3
Birds and bees and
Follow me, we'll be dreamin'
We'll be dreamin' yea

As empty as free space
Eyes they had no trace
You said let's take a break
100 days till May

Everything looked different
Your neck it held no chain
Blame became the game
Blame became the game

Forever yours, forever yours
Forever yours, forever yours

Color me mine mug
such a sublime hug
People watching in the park till after dark
Sand gets everywhere
but we do not care
We were there, we were there

No, table!
Stay where you are
When you're near you still feel far
Always have to be so right
All bark and all that bite

No, table!
Stay where you are
When you're near you still feel far
Always have to be so right
All bark and all that bite

Color me mine mug
such a sublime hug
People watching in the park till after dark
Sand gets everywhere
but we do not care
We were there, we were there

Color me mine mug
such a sublime hug
People watching in the park till after dark
Sand gets everywhere
but we do not care
We were there, we were there
