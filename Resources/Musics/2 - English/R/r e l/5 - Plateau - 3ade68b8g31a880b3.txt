PLATEAU

Time slipping away, time slipping
Time slipping away, time slipping
Time slipping away, time slipping away

Park bench occupied, just me reclined
Before you crossed my path, crossed my mind
Used your best so I stood up
Got me here, so fill my cup
Clock stands still, while we move fast

The candle from the little shop in Paris, our adventure
Wax and wicker sitting on your dresser to remember

Oh, I said it from the get go
I wouldn't take a plateau
Oh, I'm riding with you on your yoyo
it's getting time to let go

Time slipping away, time slipping
Time slipping away, time slipping
Time slipping away, time slipping away

Watching Netflix in your bed
Back when you remembered every word I said
Might as well unplug the clock
'cause time was just an afterthought
Clock stood still while we moved fast

The candle mighta flickered but it always burned
in full glow
Dripping on the dresser, our forever flame's
got no where left to go

Oh, I said it from the get go
I wouldn't take a plateau
Oh, I'm riding with you on your yoyo
it's getting time to let go

Time slipping away from me
time slipping away from me
Time slipping away
Time slipping away from me
time slipping away from me
Time slipping away

Oh, I said it from the get go
I wouldn't take a plateau
Oh, I'm riding with you on your yoyo
it's getting time to let go

Time slipping away, time slipping
Time slipping away, time slipping
Time slipping away, time slipping away
