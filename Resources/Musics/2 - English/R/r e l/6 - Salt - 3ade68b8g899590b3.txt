SALT

Nacl Nacl
Nacl Nacel-el-el

Salinity's higher in the sea
Floatin' in the ocean with me
Stinging with our open wounds
we're in the shambles of our ruin

Sand sprinkled 'tween our toes
Or salt crystals we do not know
Wrinkling the tight, white flesh
Drying up the water wet

Sodium overload
Lick it, love it, leave it cold
Sodium overload
Turn away 'fore it gets old

Nacl Nacl
Nacl Nacel-el-el

Girl's night out, we're gettin' turnt
Lacy thongs, we're in tight skirts
Tequila shots before we go
Gotta lick the salt first though

Margaritas 'cause we're classy asses
Salt on the rim of our fancy glasses
Blisters forming from our 6-inch heels
And all the guys up in the club trynta cop a feel

Sodium overload
Lick it, love it, leave it cold
Sodium overload
Turn away 'fore it gets old

Old, old, old

Blood pressure running high

Sodium overload
Lick it, love it, leave it cold
Sodium overload
Turn away 'fore it gets old

Nacl Nacl
Nacl Nacel-el-el
