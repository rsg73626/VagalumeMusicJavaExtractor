GROWING PAINS

Standing straight and tall, face forward thoughts ahead
Stepped into the hall, facing what I'd dreaded
I didn't break, I was a strong one then
New story, new town
Couldn't let my guard down
Maybe I'd hurt, maybe I'd drown
Stoic castaway, stuck on the ground

When familiar faded away, I closed off the world
Things a changing I was afraid, couldn't bear my soul

Then why does it feel so strange
saying goodbye to you?
Finally on my own, didn't I want this view?
Why do I feel so small, taking these steps alone?
The girl who could handle
all has found she's not full grown

The time is drawing near, I always held so dear
Time to cut the rope, set the ship to sea
Hands won't let it go, why am I gun shy?
Not nearly the end, more like the beginning
A winding road ahead, filled with new things thrilling
Breath cutting short, where has my courage gone?

When familiar faded away, I closed off the world
Things a changing I was afraid, couldn't bear my soul

Then why does it feel so strange
saying goodbye to you
Finally on my own, didn't I want this view?
Why do I feel so small, taking these steps alone?
The girl who could handle
all has found she's not full grown

Not saying I'm the same, as what I was before
I'm learning how to fail, and opening up new doors
Growing into shoes, my feet never filled before

Then why does it feel this way, saying goodbye to you
Finally on my own, didn't I want this now?
Why do I feel so small, taking these steps alone
The girl who could handle
all has found she's not full-grown
I've found I'm not full-grown, I found I'm not full-grown
