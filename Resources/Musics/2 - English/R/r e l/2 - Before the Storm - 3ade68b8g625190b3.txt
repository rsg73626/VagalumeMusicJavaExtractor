BEFORE THE STORM

Getting back to that old stuff
Where we were
Before the storm, the calm before the storm

Picking up where we left off
Having fun
You could've sworn, the calm before the storm

I got a trick or two up my sleeve
You aren? t gonna see them, but you're gonna feel them

You pulled me in, I let you know I liked it slow
I liked it slow, you let me go
You pulled me in, I let you know, I liked it slow
You let me go

Letting you throw the first punch
Playing dumb
The brawl is won, the fight is far from done

I've had enough of your old shit
Time to split
The storm's begun, make you wish you'd never come

I got a trick or two up my sleeve
You aren't gonna see them, but you're gonna feel them

You pulled me in, I let you know I liked it slow
I liked it slow, you let me go
You pulled me in, I let you know, I liked it slow
You let me go

Your overthrow, sprawled on the floor
breath gone for good
you misunderstood me
when play me you thought you could
You took me by surprise, I can take you by surprise too
Up my sleeve I got a trick or two

You pulled me in, I let you know I liked it slow
I liked it slow, you let me go
You pulled me in, I let you know, I liked it slow
You let me go

I got a trick or two up my sleeve
You aren't gonna see them
but you're gonna feel them
