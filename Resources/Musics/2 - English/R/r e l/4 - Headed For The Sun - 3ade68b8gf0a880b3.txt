HEADED FOR THE SUN

In our game, all answers pointed home
Oh-so tame, we'd never let it show
Lit your match, watched the gold flame
Map ablaze, shit we had the wrong aim

Turning back ain't an option
With your match, came a toxin
Rocking back and forth in my space clothes
Paper clips aglow, you let it go

we're headed for the sun
All systems go
Rocketing space fast
Earth far below
we're headed for the sun
All systems go
Ship's 'bout to blow

you're facing Mars, I'm facing Jupiter
Locked inside these bars, but you're still keeping score
I'm losing air, but you're so full of it
This spaceship didn't come with the right toolkit

I wanna scream, I wanna skip your turn
Throw the dice, watch them burn, burn, burn
Steal your helmet, throw it to the stars
But we're strapped into these seats, we're flying far

we're headed for the sun
All systems go
Rocketing space fast
Earth far below
we're headed for the sun
All systems go
Ship's 'bout to blow

Ship's 'bout to blow
Locked inside these bars, but you're still keeping score
you're still keeping score

we're headed for the sun
All systems go
Rocketing space fast
Earth far below
we're headed for the sun
All systems go
Ship's 'bout to blow
