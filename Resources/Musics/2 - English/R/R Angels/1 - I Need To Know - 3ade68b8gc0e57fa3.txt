I NEED TO KNOW

R. Angels---I Need To Know 

Come on baby, come on right now 
I need to know boy, I need to know right now 
Hep, hep, hep, hep 
Oh na, na, ah, ah, na, na, na, na 

Oh boy when you look at me. Am I ever in your fantasies? 
Do you ever find me on your mind, cuz I think of you all the time (all the time) 
Oh boy I'm so into you, there's nothing that I wouldn't do 
I'll give you what you please, just tell me baby what you need 

[Bridge] 
Come on boy, I'm here for you 
Just tell me what I have to do 
Here's your chance, I know you wont regret it 
A million to one if you come and get it 
I'll be your pleasure all the time, just say the words that you'll be mine 
I know there's nothing I wouldn't do, just let me be with you 

[Chorus] 
I need to know (I need) 
If you love me too 
If these same crazy feelings can come over you 
I need to know what I can do to make you love me the way I love you (I love you) 

Oh na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah 
Ah na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh, boy 

Oh, boy if you think I'm fast, you really ain't seen nothing yet 
but if you want nice and slow, don't hesitate to let me know 
Oh, boy what can I say, I'll be with you in anyway (anyway baby) 
You just need to say the word, I'll promise you I'll rock your world 
[Bridge] 
[Chorus] 

I need to know if you feel it to babe 
I need to know if there's a chance with you 
I need to know if I'm the one for you 
Oh, baby, baby, I need to know 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
[Chorus]
