EYE OF THE STORM

*scratching* "times running out"
*scratching* "got to decide now"
*scratching* "but something inside wont let me quit"

[Verse]
People are so fickle
These days its so despicable
Like tentacles, they all try stick to you
Hold you down if they can or besicken you
They try to blind you with they aim too
Enforcin written jurasdictions that we all got to stick to
The laws disappear and reappear to suit their needs
Which to me is a joke, like short term peace treaties
I see disease, swarmin like bees
Stingin these undeveloped war torn countries
Apparently I'm on the good side, but this worlds so shaky at times
I swear this planets on an intergalactic fault line
Every time I race I cant win
I keep pace till these land mines blow up in my face again
Dismembered, I still gotta keep pacing on
Treading strong, facing the eye of the storm

[Chorus]
These days, replay, the life game of wrong
These days, what we say, can do such harm
I replay, each day, like an endless song
Billing through my mind non stop
Like the hands of ti-i-i-iiime

[Verse]
Whats with this financial envy
We got so much poverty but we keep spending
We're like pigs they just wont stop eating
Till they hit the bottom of the trough
And thier guts leaking, im seeking the truth, but
How can it be, we're in a world of broken familys
And fallacies, taught to praise stars and seek fame
Do what we must to obtain monetery gain
And even im with it, but there are limits
Whatever happened to a conscious idea, emcees talk verbal diarheoua
Caught up with gun talk and bling-bling
Hip-hop producers, who work with pop singers
For ching-ching, im thinking
A rich soul, is now of no value
Light turns to dark when cold breath hits the candle
I'm here to rekindle your spirit
Keep the flame burning strong
As we press on, through the eye of the storm

[Chorus]

[Verse]
The clock ticks, your name off the list
Life moves quick so we gotta move quicker
The world's devilish, makin me sicker
I smell the remanents, of drugs sex and liqour
The kids are, immune to these
Cos they leave, they get a fix on they new tv
Parents dont need to talk to their kids no more
They feed em videos, show em the internet
Log on to the porn site, here we go
Television, the drug of a nation
Breeding ignorance, feeding radiation
Frenzhal hit the nail on the head
Wish we were sailing ahead
But we're shipwrecked and failing instead
But the tests have changed, we're all passin
So long as your a expert in arson
I'm askin, which ways up, cos my compass has gone
You know what? I'm a let my beatin heart be my guide through the eye of the
storm

[chorus]

*scratching* Nfamas "how am i supposed to live in a world filled with
negatives?"
*scratching* Nfamas "the final showdowns come round to hit ya"
