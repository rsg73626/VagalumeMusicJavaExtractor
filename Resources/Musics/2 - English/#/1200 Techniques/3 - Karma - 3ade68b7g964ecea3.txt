KARMA

[Prolouge]
Karma
What goes around comes around right? (right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They gonna slap you back (yer)
Sometimes it hurts
And thats bad karma
Watch out for it

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed
Well I guess I'll have to live day to day
and pray to god that'll I'll be ok, ay ay

[Verse 1]
These fat raps think they fit like they The Iron Man
I got the iron tounge and the iron hand
I make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet so switch the picture
If ya, look in the mirror you bound to get a reflection
Like with, every action there is a reaction
with your, dodgy actions you causing negative drama
And if you know gods law you best watch for karma
Now I'm a bomb ya
Running your traps like tacks
You think you floating on the cream
You and your rat pack
While I'm take that thought back now lets dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and (you's a matador)
I'm seeing red
(You outta swords)
I'm a target like
(Dartsboards)
You floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first while ya shakin I cut off like
umbilicals at birth

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I look around the city and its all such a pity
everybody trying to be pretty don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block nobodys playing hopscotch
there to busy on the internet surfing that rap

[Verse 3]
Just converse kind of rude like
(so what you trying to prove mate)
I say, (nothing I'm just trying to build the feeling I live like you)
I got plans to take this city up to senate
As lifes one big race and want all entrys to win it
If your not with it, like quitters then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
Your a disgrace with a desire
You need to recon through your fire and look higher higher! look around!
I got sounds that help you get down so you can get up
But oh boy i'm sick of raps that get me fed up
Yer they make me wanna throw up cause they gotta grow up
But well I'll be feeling a beard and I'll be Sailing like NOAH

[Chorus]

[Interlude 1]
Melbourne.....To Sydney......To Brisbane...Darwin.... To
Perth.....Adelaide.... Tassy
And all Across the OZ..Z..I..E...

[Verse 4]
Picture on the quota its time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall so
I got a key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And when I unlock the door I'm bringing love to my people
unlike these Fickle Fanatics that wanna cause death
cut holes flake praying we fall to hells depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
as what goes up comes down never the less
We're stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
boomerang effect as we all face our karma

[Chorus]
