NOBODY'S FOOL

[verse 1]
Fall back, take a look at me and you'll see
I'm for real, i'll feel what only i can feel
And if that don't apeal to ya let me know
And i'll go cause i flow better when my colours show
And that's the was it has to be, honestly
Cause creativity could never bloom in my room
I'd throw it all away before i'd lie, so don't call me with a compromise
Hang up the phone, i got a backbone stronger than yours

Lalala ..... yeah
[chorus]
If you trying to turn me into someone else it's easy to see
I'm not down with that i'm nobody's fool
If you trying to turn something else
I've seen it enough and i'm over that
I'm nobody's fool

If you wanna bring me down.... go ahead and try!

[verse 2]
Don't think you know me like you know yourself
But i fear that you're telling me what you want to hear
Do you give a damn understand that i can't be not what i am
I'm not the milk and cherios in your spoon it's not a simple
Here we go not so soon
I might have fallen for that when i was 14 and a little more green
But amazing what a coupe of years mean

La la la..... oh... yeah

[chorus]

[verse 3]
So go ahead and try to look me in the eye
Go ahead and try to look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Until you realize......
Things are trying to settle down
Just trying to figure out
Exactly what i'm about
If it's with or without you
I don't need your doubt in me

[chorus]
