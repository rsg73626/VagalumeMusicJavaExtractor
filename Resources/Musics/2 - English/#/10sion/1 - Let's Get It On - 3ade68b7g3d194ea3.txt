LET'S GET IT ON

Lets get it on every time
Holler out "your mine"
[chorus] [10sion not singing]
And i say "a yia yia yia"
Let's get it on every time
Holler out "your mine"
And i say "oh oo oh oo oh oh oh oh oh"
So if you willin' you wit it then we can spend time
And i say "a yia yia yia"
Let's get it on every time
Holler out "your mine"
And i say "oh oo oh oo oh oh oh oh oh"
I'm one zero so you know you gotta be a dime
And i say "a yia yia yia"
Let's get it on every time
Holler out "your mine"
And i say "oh oo oh oo oh oh oh oh oh"
You lookin' fine in the sun
And how you move i'm prayin' that your the one
Come on
[10sion]
This is for them playas and them playettes
Puttin' smoke in the air, sippin' on some moet
Mami it's a new year to get it started
Peep game, hit the party then we get retarded
I'm in the middle poppin' bottles, hollerin' at jiggies
Leave 'em hypnotized while we listenin' to biggie
Too high off a sticky
I'm in the zone
Holler at me on the real, i'm a take you home
Let's get it on
[chorus]
[10sion]
We hit the city like a kingpin late night
Bailin' in the club
Mami show me love, i'll hit it rightbrown, black, or white
Long as the body's bangin'
If your rollin' put your lips where the chain's hangin'
See my momma gave game out you fast women
They want a dude who be shinin', always spendin'
I'll spend a little bit a time
You mind's in a trance
See my hand's is on the booty when we slow dance
Let's get it on girl
[chorus]
[chorus repeats until end without 10sion]
