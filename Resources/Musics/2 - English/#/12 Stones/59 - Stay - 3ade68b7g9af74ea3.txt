STAY

I walk to the edge again, searching for the truth 
Taken by the memories of all that I've been through 
If I could hear your voice I know I would be okay 
I know that I've been wrong but I'm begging you to stay 
Would you stay? 

Will you be here or will I be alone? 
Will I be scared? you'll teach me how to be strong 
And if I fall down will you help me carry on 
I cannot do this alone 

I wish that I could turn back time 
Just to have one more chance 
To be the man I need to be, 
I pray you'll understand 
If I could hear your voice 
I know I would be okay 
I know that I've been wrong 
But I'm begging you to stay 
Would you stay?

Will you be here or will I be alone? 
Will I be scared? 
You'll teach me how to be strong 
And if I fall down will you help me carry on 
I cannot do this alone 

I need your hand to help me through again 
Nothing compares to how I feel when I look at you 
You never know, you never know tomorrow 
You never know, you never know tomorrow 
Don't walk away 

Will you be here or will I be alone? 
Will I be scared? 
You'll teach me how to be strong 
And if I fall down will you help me carry on 
I cannot do this alone 
(2x) 

I am not alone I know you're there (3x) 
I am not alone.
