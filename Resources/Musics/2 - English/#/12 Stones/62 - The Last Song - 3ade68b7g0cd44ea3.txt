THE LAST SONG

I'm sorry for needing you to carry me
So simple sometimes when you're standing next
To me
You never change you never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with
One last song to sing

Take it all away from me and tell me how you
Want this to be
I want you i need you

A life without you made me wonder why i'm here
Until i found nothing ever seemed so clear
You never change you never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with
One last song to sing

I lose myself in everything you say i lose myself
In everything
I never knew that i could feel this way i never
Knew that i could feel
