BACK UP


I hear the words you say to me
I see the way you look at me
I know what's on your mind so
Stand up get up back up now
Just stay away

I know the fear you hold inside
I know what's weighing on your mind
There's nothing you can do so
Stand up get up back up

You're reaching out just to be like me
But you've fallen short
Still you're following me
You had the chance to bring me down
But there's nothing left
So just stay away from me

You can't stand to see my face
To know you'll never take my place
There's nothing you can do but
Stand up get up back up now
Just stay away

I feel the hate you push on me
I see the things that you can't see
I know what's on your mind so
Stand up get up back up

It's not the things you say to me
It's not the things that I believe
You try to bring me down
So stand up get up back up now Just stay away
