MY LIFE

I find myself in question again 
And I doubt this Love you've given to me 
I hope you understand when I say 
I need this time to myself 

You speak your mind to me again 
You force your words so deep within 
You try to tell me how to live 
But it's my life

I know your open arms too well 
Cause I've lost myself there many times before 
I need to slowly fall away 
Far from the grip you have on me

You speak your mind to me again 
You force your words so deep within 
You try to tell me how to live 
But it's my life
I find these words were never true 
I've lost all my respect for you 
I need to find my own way 
It's my life

I gotta get away 
One step away 
I gotta get away 
Just one step away 
I gotta away you're pushing me away 
I gotta get away 
Well I'm gone
