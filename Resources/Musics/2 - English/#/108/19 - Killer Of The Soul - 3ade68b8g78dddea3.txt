KILLER OF THE SOUL

Killer of the soul... satanic ritual set the corpse upon the table, cosmetic religion, hide your horns, if you are able. Killer of the animal, only a demon could dine on the flesh of the dead, each hair on the back of each cow, is birth you'll spend in hell. 
The killer of the soul, whomever he may be, will be forced in the darkest regions, embrace your decisions, in the darkest regions of hell. 
Self killing ritual, set the bottle upon the table, cosmetic ignorance, kill the pain. 
Killerof the animal within, liquid poison to wash your brain, drown in your misery, your life becomes a hell. 
The killer of the soul, whomever he may be, will be forced in the darkest regions, embrace your decisions, in the darkest regions of hell. I won't kill my soul.
