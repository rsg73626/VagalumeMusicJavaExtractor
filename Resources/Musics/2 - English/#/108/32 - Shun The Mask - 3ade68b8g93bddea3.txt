SHUN THE MASK

Tear tears through my eye
A screaming struggle
To shin the shallow me
The calculated "I"
Penetrate the pretense
Of this plastic life
Hard? Yes it's hard
(what did you expect?)
easy life? easy lie

Crackerjack smile is cracked
I spy the lie decry the lie
Jack tragic trace:
Tear etching scars your caked
On clown face

I shun the mask
I'll never put it back
