NOONENOMORE

Invested your identity
In a world that raped you of your entity
Projected personality
On a world-less individuality
I look in my eyes and I see no one
I look deep into your eyes: no one

My colour and my fire
Sapped by the external objects I desire
I drown in my melodrama,
My soul leaks out the cracks

I looked in my eyes and I saw no one
I stared a mile into my smile: no one
No one no more

I know I'm someone,
And I know that there is something more
I know your world is nothing
Nothing in it for me anymore
I turn my back on your corpse hearted "reality"
I walk right out that door
I disaccept your nothingness

I am your no one no more
