PYRO STOKE

what do you see? what do you see? all your knowledge; too much. no relevance to me; false authority. bits and bytes; crashed pledge of life. promise, artificial promise; lies. literary, unreal paper life. 
psycho-physical fuel for smoke. pyro stoke… knowledge of fools. sick joke of misery. your schools are slaughtering fools. what do you see? what will you see? what can you see? you don’t even know that you’re not, you’re not body. you’re not body.
