MANTRA SIX

Mantra six... changing pictures, bright and framed through window smoke, like fire burning ashes, ashes of your hope. How will you reap the harvest of technology? 
How will you flee the forest of your insanity? Burning, forest, grueling, harvest, off line frame brain, locked in to the on-line main frame, and rows of houses all the same, and rows of people drenched in plain. Your (our) desire brings on the pain.
