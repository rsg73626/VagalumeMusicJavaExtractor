STRENGTH AND FEAR

Do we think we're right? Are we strong? Are we fair? Or are we just scared to step outside our heads and hearts? So insulate, separate and denigrate those who relate to ideas and ways that make us question ourselves
I want to learn to love and I want to learn to be free but that means (first) finding comfort within me and it's not so fucking easy in a world that feels pitted against me… where I pit i against I
So much hate, so much pain because we're not the same but what are we scared of being scared of? So segregate, violate the rights of those who don't relate but we've got no guts to stand in front of ourselves
I want to learn to love and I want to learn to be free but that means (first) finding comfort within me and it's not so fucking easy in a world that feels pitted against me… where I pit i against I
Fight our spiritual genocide, own our fears, this hardened shell we carry is a basket of our fears. Fight our spiritual genocide, own your fears. This idea genocide, emotional genocide, spiritual genocide… hide, hide, hide, hide, hide! 
I want to learn to love and I want to learn to be free but that means (first) finding comfort within me and it's not so fucking easy in a world that feels pitted against me where I pit i against i
