ANGEL STRIKE MAN

angel strike man. we're forgetting, again. buildings are falling and we're failing again. numb to the misery from all the blood stained imagery 
angel striking man 
sell yourself into slavery again, sell our children to the state again, sell your body to commercials again, sell your soul for the dollar again. shackled for forgetting, forgetting again. shackled just long enough to remember again 
every word is politics, every action; a smoking gun and if you deny it run, run, run 
angel strike man.
