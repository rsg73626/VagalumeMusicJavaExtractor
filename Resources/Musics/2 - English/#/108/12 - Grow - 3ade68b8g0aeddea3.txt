GROW

you know i gotta grow i gotta yearn i gotta learn and i got to move ahead. you're not excluded. you're invited. somethings are gonna hafta rearange. that doesn't mean we're gonna hafta "grow" estranged. i need inspiration. not monotonous degredation. 
i've got to grow 
don't feel intimidation from the pushes and the pulls of the general population. i'll never shut the door, but i've got to search for more.
