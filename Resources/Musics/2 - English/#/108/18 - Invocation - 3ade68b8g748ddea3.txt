INVOCATION

Invocation... I will not break beneath your suffocation, although you stalk within mymind, in constant oppression. 
Now I decide, now I arise, now I defile the disguise, that you employ to destroy me, we will destroy you. 
He is my unbounded fountain of power, and rising within my heart, infuses me to overpower, although you try to slip me into your chilling chokehold the infinite within will ever oppose you and devour. 
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise within my heart. 
Rise within me, madhusudana. 
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise Master within my heart.
