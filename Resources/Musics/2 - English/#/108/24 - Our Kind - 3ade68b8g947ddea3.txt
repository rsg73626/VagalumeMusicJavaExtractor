OUR KIND

shutters closed, ac on, in your second house. volume on high, two pictures at a time, beats real life. (want a) serial killer? just look in the mirror, what do you see? don't want your rock and roll, no acting please, or to purchase tru beauty. is this what you wanted to be? 
lose our minds, one day at a time when pain is all we see. void humanity with stories at 11, monetary interests (define the) bottom line. lose our soul, one verse at a time when words overcome feeling. Not a lack of this nor a lack of that, it's just our kind. is this what i wanted to be? 
dying just to be something other than what we wanted to be. dying for something i never wanted to be.
