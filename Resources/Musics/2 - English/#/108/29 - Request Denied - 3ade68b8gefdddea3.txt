REQUEST DENIED

"Return to madness"
I ponder on your dark embrace
"Return to lunacy"
Mesmerized, I drift towards the brink
"Return to madness"
About to extinguish my heart
"Return to a world for me"
I must not accept your relentless request
I can not accept your relentless request
I will not I will not I will not I will not
Your request is denied, denied
