(WALK?) THEIR PATH

Played their games and I walked their ways… it was supposed to make me
someone but when I opened up my hands, when I opened up my heart, I
found no one. What I have inside is what I must discover… what I had
inside is what I must recover. Don't walk their path… path of doom.
University degree, a six figure salary, it gave us nothing. Gave away
my liberty for what others wanted for me and now I'm left with
nothing. What we have inside is what we must discover and what we had
inside is what we must recover. A friend, a lover, an anthem that you
sung… a different lie for everyone (I was a liar) because when I
opened up my hands, when I opened up my heart, I found... a dead
flower. What we have inside is what we must discover and what we had
inside is what we must recover.
