GOPINATH

oh Gopinath - lord of the Gopis - please hear my request. i am a wicked materialist, always addicted to worldly desires, and no good qualities do i possess. 
oh Gopinath indeed i am a servant of lust. worldly desires are awakening in my heart, and the noose of fruitive work tightens... 
oh Gopinath, i do not know what devotion is. abandoning my real treasure, i have worshipped this mundane world. but please, do not consider this servant and outsider.
