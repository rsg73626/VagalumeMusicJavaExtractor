HOLYNAME

I have no emotion; I have no devotion just empty
motions, oceans of motions intent on ego promotion. No
elation, just devastation, supplication seems a foreign
creation. 
Barren and beaten and bruised is the briar-ridden,
torn land of my heart, my cries are lies from
conceitful eyes
I won?t shimmer in this
complacency. I won?t settle for this false me.
