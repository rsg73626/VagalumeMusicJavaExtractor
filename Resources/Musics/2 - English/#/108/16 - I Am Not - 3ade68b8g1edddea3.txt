I AM NOT

You try to shoot me down
Your mouth is like a loaded gun
A million cries of a billion lies
That's your ammunition
Miconception

Dissemination of false information
Stereotyped
Perceptions

But I am not as you portray me
The pictures you paint of my face
The images don't convey me

Obscuration

The confusion you usher I prolongs
This dark age's ignorant duration
