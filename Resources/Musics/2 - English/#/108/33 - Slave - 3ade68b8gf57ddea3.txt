SLAVE

don't tell me you don't surrender. and don't sasy you're not a servant. i see you slave away to the dictates of your senses. you must obey. 
Slave 
in the name of freedom, we tie us up in chains 
you live on your knees, despite your lyrical pleas. you bow your head to the ground. lust: this is your god. greed: this is your god. sex: is your god. and he wipes the floor with you, slave. i reject this whole charade.
