HOPELESS

the deeper i try to go. the shallower i find myself. i dance on the strings of selfishness, self-righteousness. imprisoned in my house of greed. entombed in torturous envy. i am not free. abassador of arrogancy, every step a proud conspiracy. everything orbit me. emblem of hypocricy. imprisoned in my house of greed. entombed in torutous envy. i am not free.

strength of the strong, wisdom of the wise, proven now - how long can you hold the mirror to your eyes?
govinda. gauranga. hey nitaichandra. i'm not helpless.
