LIAR

you said i could find love in the folds of your flesh. you said you loved me. you never knew me.

liar.

you said it was called love. you said it was more than skelletons colliding. i tried so hard. i cried so damned hard.

liar.

you tell me to force a smile. i reject your lies.
you tell me to tread on a trail of tears. i reject your lies.
you tell me to swim in your ocean of sorrow. i reject your lies.
frustration rules me no more.
