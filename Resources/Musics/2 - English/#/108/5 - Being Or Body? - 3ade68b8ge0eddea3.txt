BEING OR BODY?

Being or body... I sit, inside and stare through these window eyes, you look so far away, and when I'm next to you, the distance grows. 
Are you being or are you body? Touch you, I don't, feel you, I don't, impossibly alone, I am, staring out, at your naked robot. Are you alive, are you alive, are you alive inside those window eyes? Are you alive, are you alive, are you alive inside: as am I. 
I am being, trapped in body, I am being, am not body, mantra freeing, liberation of being. HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE.
