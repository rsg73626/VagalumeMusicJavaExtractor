WOMAN

Did you really fall for this again?
Did you believe that he was a man?
Did you think there was something real
In the things we've said.
Just to be a lord over you (in bed) ?
He'll tell you everything
You'll ever want to hear
Cause he wants to be you most dear
He wants to be the reason for you tear
And the music that's playing in your ear
He wants to be your reservoir of pleasure
And wants to be your heart's only treasure
Your everything, your only-thing
Your god, he wants to be your god

How far you fall for it? how far you fall

He's the only "he"
What you see in me, that's a falsity
Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami

This ain't no song of flattery
I'm pointing out our stupidity:
Dumb femminity, dumb masculinity

Think about it

Did you dream you were more than his trophy?
Sex turn you to dirt, a non-entity
Sex turns you (us) to stone and that's reality
