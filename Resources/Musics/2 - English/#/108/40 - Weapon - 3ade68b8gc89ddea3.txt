WEAPON

This is the weapon of real revolution
This is the fire of the final rebellion
Politics, that ain't gonna solve this
Sociologist, your plan is useless

Without the heart being changed
You won't do nothing but re-arrange
The dearanged situation
Of human exploitation
And that is why I imply.

This is the weapon of the real revolution
Unlock the coils
The clamped around your spiritual frame
By crying out the holyname
