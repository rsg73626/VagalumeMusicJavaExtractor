SERVE AND DEFY

Serve and defy... try to give myself in these words, try to express self in song, try to clarify all the reasons why. Try to clarify why? what I said, why I said, why. Because I know that I know I, am not body. Try to give myself in these words, will you open up your heart to these words, try to clarify, try to amplify, I got to clarify why? what costume. 
Externals will suffocate me. Don't give me your costume. I'll try to reach inside. I got to clarify, I got to amplify all the reasons why I choose to serve and defy, I got to clarify, I got to amplify, why? what I said, why I said, why. Because I know that I know I, am not body. May He Shine through these words
