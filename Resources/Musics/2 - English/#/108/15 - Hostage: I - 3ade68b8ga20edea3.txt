HOSTAGE: I

Return the hostage, return the hostage: I
The hollowness within me burns
Without me "I"m" a plastic hide
Inside I hide a brutal void
Release me, release the hostage: I
This situation is self degradation
My will becomes nill
Just a slave to the thrill
Of the pain instilling chilling killing
Of my self-willing devotion

Hostage: I, held in the web of my own lie
The hollowness inside, it burns a man alive
I am yours, and you are mine
This is the true self I need I bleed to find

Give me back to me
And I'll give me back to you
