ARCTIC

Arctic... I'll try for you, I'd try for you, try, trial by ice. I can simply extend my fingers in a pose of exquisite pain, I can only twist my arm, stretch, reach, for you, try, try, try, try, try, try to survive I'll try for you, I'd try, try, trial by ice. 
I need a blanket to warm me from the chill of my emptiness, I need a blanket to exsultate me, because it is so cold inside. Try not to freeze free-ze: die a jolting phone, cataclysmic in the bone marrow night, I need a blanket to warm me from the chill, of my emptiness, where is sleep to hide me from the fact that you're so absent from my heart? Where is sleep to hide me from the fact that I'm too dead to even care? Hollow are the bones of lonely. I stand hollow. I die... hollow. but I try.
