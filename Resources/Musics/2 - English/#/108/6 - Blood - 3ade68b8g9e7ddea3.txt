BLOOD

Blood... specter image, risen in the graveyard of my mind they embrace and I see blood, I see blood, I see blood and bones and not romance, not romance. 
The blood, the blood and the bones, the blood and the skulls, passionate collision of skeletons, ashen impact again cried out and then they crumbled, they cried out, they cried out, and they crumbled collapsed, like the dreams they tried to build, that could never be fullfilled in this world. 
The blood, the blood and the bones, the blood and the skulls, passionate collision of and skeletons, passionate collision of bodies. "Pessimist" but ain't it so factual, everything is temporary in this world, my reality is not bleak because I live for my soul, I give my love to my Soul of my soul. 
The blood, the blood and the bones, the blood and the skulls, passionate collision of skeletons, I shall abstain.
