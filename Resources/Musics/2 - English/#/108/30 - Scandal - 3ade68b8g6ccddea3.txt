SCANDAL

Scandal... scandalous how slanderous, ludicrous how fallacious, the preponderance of ignorance, that you cast upon thy people, publications of fabrications, dislocated misquotations, try to cast a culture as a creature of scorn. 
And I'd like to, to tear you, to pieces, but I wont, you punish your own self, with the fists of your own, of your own ignorance, outrageous, raging, racist, rhetoric, I read upon the page, publications of fabrications, just another misquotations, to insult my friends, to insult my people, you insult my God? 
No, you insult only your own self. And I'd like to, to tear you, to pieces, but I wont, you punish your own self, with the fists of your own, of your own ignorance. My culture, my people, my culture is KRISHNA.
