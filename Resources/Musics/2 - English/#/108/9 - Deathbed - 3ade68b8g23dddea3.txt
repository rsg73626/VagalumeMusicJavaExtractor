DEATHBED

I remember when you cried
With your eyes on fire
With the gale in your lungs,
Screamed your throat red
But now it's getting colder?
What happened to you?
You're on your deathbed
I remember when you laughed
With the sunlight on your lips
Sun rising high
On your early morning smile
But you're not waking up this time?
Breathless cries over lifeless eyes

Your body is here, but you're not

That thing that screamed with me
And dreamed with me
That thing that laughed with me
And cried with me
That same thing lies before me
On this deathbed
But where are you?

You're not on your deathbed
