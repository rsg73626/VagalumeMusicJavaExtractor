CURSE OF INSTINCT

Curse of instinct never knowing peace. even pain is welcome when you cannot feel a thing and it only gets harder to put together the pieces that just don’t fit; they just won’t fit. 
And it only gets lonelier when you’re stuck outside. caught in a void; drown in denial. and it only gets harder to fit together the pieces; it only gets lonelier when you’re stuck outside. you can’t fit together the pieces and you’re ripped apart by the void. the emptiness in you… the emptiness in you. 
And I won’t lie anymore; i won’t hide it anymore. the emptiness, the void, the void in my heart. the you. can you feel it? can you feel the emptiness in you? the emptiness, the void, in you.
