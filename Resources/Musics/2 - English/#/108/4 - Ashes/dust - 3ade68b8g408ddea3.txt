ASHES/DUST

ashes / dust, your body belongs to the fire

ask you why must I die for your comfort compromise? ask you why must they die for your fancy flavored fillet prize? killed and bred, blood runs red, so you can gratify what's already dead. homeless cry, hungry die, while your flesh kitchen scrapes the sky 
ashes / dust, your body belongs to the fire
 
ask you why must I die for your comfort compromise? scream for bread, underfed, so you can decorate what's already dead. i won't try for your lies. i won't inherit your empty eyes. compromise, compromise, my soul i will not compromise 

government sponsored genocide, their media led by corporate talking heads watch as they justify the thousands already dead. all the while they'll mourn the lose of a life not yet lived with their blood messages neatly displayed on the side of trucks, while millions die in the streets; millions die at their feet 

ashes / dust, your body belongs to the fire.
