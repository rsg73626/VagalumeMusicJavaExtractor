REPEAT

stare at the ground, there's no hope today but you, you can't wish life away 
distract until the clock has circled all the way. you'll settle for anything, anything to make it go away 
when do we reclaim ourselves and all that lives within our hearts and in our head? stop waiting for a sign when all of the answers are right in front of your faceâ€¦ all of the answers are right in front of your face.
