WHAT YOU GONNA DO ANYWAY

Time seemed always on our side
When there's nothing left to hide
We have everything to lose, but more to gain

We've been together all this time
And I know I crossed the line
But together we can make it through the pain
I'm just an ordinary man
But now I understand
Wish I could turn back the hands of time again

She said
What are you gonna do anyway
Just pack up your bags and run away
It's just the same old lies
Don't wanna hear it anymore she said

Fool I would never let you be
I just want you here with me
What can I do to turn it all around
I'm gonna miss you if you're gone
I don't think I could go on
I'm a broken record spinning round and round

She said
What are you gonna do anyway
Just pack up your bags and run away
It's just the same old lies
Don't wanna hear it anymore she said
