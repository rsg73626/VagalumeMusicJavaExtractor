WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE

Was thinking bout my family
And all the good friends close to me
They helped me up when I was down
Moved me up to higher ground

Looking back I can only say
That I'm just not the same
My life has changed in so many ways

It's the love that you feel
When you learn to fly with a broken wing
It's the love that you see
In the face of a child on a mother's knee
It's the love that you live
When you learn to share
And you've learned to give
It's the love that you feel
When you're in love

Seasons come and seasons go
Take some time and learn to grow
Every day there's a brand new dawn
Another day to carry on

All in all it's a carousel
Another time around
The best things in life I've already found

It's the love that you feel
When you learn to fly with a broken wing
It's the love that you see
In the face of a child on a mother's knee
It's the love that you live
When you learn to share
And you've learned to give
It's the love that you feel
When you're in love
