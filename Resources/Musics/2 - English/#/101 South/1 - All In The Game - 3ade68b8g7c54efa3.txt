ALL IN THE GAME

I saw you standing alone
In the corner so cold
Looking in the mirror at me
I couldn't see in your eyes
Through the smoke and the lights
If those tears were costly or free

Then you turned and you looked my way
With those eyes full of tears and regret
Oh I held you close for a while
And I told you once girl
There's just some things I'll never forget

Cos it's all in the game
This heartbreak and shame
Love has left you lonely again
No more tears from my eyes
I now realize
Your love was just a game of pretend

Walking alone on this downtown street
Tryin to get my head off of you
Can't seem to shake this pain
How you left me again
Stranded not knowing what to do

Don't seem to know of anything more
Or anything left to say
You wanted just what you got
And now you're alone
You had to have it your own way

Cos it's all in the game
This heartbreak and shame
Love has left you lonely again
No more tears from my eyes
I now realize
Your love was just a game of pretend

Now you stand waiting
With your arms open wide
But I'm on the outside looking
I'm standing on the other side

Cos it's all in the game
This heartbreak and shame
Love has left you lonely again
No more tears from my eyes
I now realize
Your love was just a game of pretend

Cos it's all in the game...
