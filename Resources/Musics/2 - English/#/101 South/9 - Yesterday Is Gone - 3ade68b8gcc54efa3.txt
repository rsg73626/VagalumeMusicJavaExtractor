YESTERDAY IS GONE

Looking back on all your sorrow
Looking at your life
It's a brand new day tomorrow
Another page in life

All the past is gone but you can
Take another road
All the reasons that you can let go

Because yesterday is gone
Now there's only tomorrow and
Come to find I was wrong
Through the sadness and sorrow I

I made a few mistakes
Gotta live with the pain and regrets
Because yesterday is gone

Your open book on reality
Was only in your head
A wrong turn only to discover
That you'd been misled

You try to find the right direction
Looking for a sign
Chasing dreams will only make you blind

Because yesterday is gone
Now there's only tomorrow and
Come to find I was wrong
Through the sadness and sorrow I

I made a few mistakes
Gotta live with the pain and regrets
Because yesterday is gone

You took a path, a path to nowhere
Then you were outta sight
It revealed the secrets of your life

Because yesterday is gone
Now there's only tomorrow and
Come to find I was wrong
Through the sadness and sorrow I

I made a few mistakes
Gotta live with the pain and regrets
Because yesterday is gone
