FROM WHAT YOU KNOW NOW

Take a moment enjoy the seasons
Take your time and walk don't run
Set aside some time for laughter
Learn to cry before the kids are grown

Looking back on those moments
They're the only ones we've got
Teach your children all the lessons
That you learned
Before you are gone

Take a change and make it happen
Help them stand before they fall
Another lesson as they get older
Before you know they'll be on their own
Steer them in the right direction how
From what you know now
From what you know now

When your friends
They all seem the scatter
And you find that you've lost your way
That's the time
To find what really matters
The little things
That really helped you stay
There's a peaceful emotion
When you're on your way back home
Treasure every moment
That you got
Before you are gone

Take a change and make it happen
Help them stand before they fall
Another lesson as they get older
Before you know they'll be on their own
Steer them in the right direction how
From what you know now
From what you know now
