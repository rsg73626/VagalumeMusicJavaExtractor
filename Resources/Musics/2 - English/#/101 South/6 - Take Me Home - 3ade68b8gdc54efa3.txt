TAKE ME HOME

Takin my time
Tryin to find my way home
Passin along this dusty road
Each day I find
That I'm a little farther on
Looking for shelter from the storm

Remember all the things that we've been through
All I know is that I want to be with you

Please take me home
Cos I'm a little farther than I want to go
I really need you now and I think you know
That I can't go on without you
Cos I've never felt this way
And all I want for you to do is take me home

Before I knew what a good thing could be
You were gone and out of sight
I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
And have you in my life

I know I have done some things that were wrong
But deep inside I've always loved you all along

Please take me home
Cos I'm a little farther than I want to go
I really need you now and I think you know
That I can't go on without you
Cos I've never felt this way
And all I want for you to do is take me home
