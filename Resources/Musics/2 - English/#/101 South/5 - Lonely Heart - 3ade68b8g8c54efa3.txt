LONELY HEART

I'm lying alone in this motel
A guitar or two by my side
Tomorrow is only a day away
When I'll be boarding a 6:30 flight

My clothes are all othrown in a suitcase
Just too many days on the road
The same old song's on the radio
I'm tired and I wanna go home

All my life it's the same old story
Cos love's a lonely game
But I know it could be so simple
I'm calling out your name

Lonely heart you're confused
You don't know what to do
And you can't tell your left from your right
When the days go so slow
I just want you to know
I've made up my mind, I made up my mind

I'm down on my luck like a runaway
There's dirt and there's holes in these shoes
With a chill in the air I'm just miles away
I guess I got nothing to lose

All these dreams it's a sad old story
Just searchin for a clue
And I know love could be so simple
I'm comin home to you

Lonely heart you're confused
You don't know what to do
And you can't tell your left from your right
When the days go so slow
I just want you to know
I've made up my mind, I made up my mind

Lonely heart
I've made up my mind
Have you made up your mind?
