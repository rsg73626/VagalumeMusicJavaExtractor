DON'T TELL ME IT'S OVER

Yesterday I heard you came round
Knockin on my door
Was it just a remedy that I was hopin for

Miss your smile and I miss your fingers
Running down my back
Miss the way you touch me
And how you kept us right on track

Now you say you want your freedom
Wanna fly away
I just got one more thing that
That I gotta say

Don't tell me it's over baby
Don't say goodbye
Don't want to live my life without you
You're my reason why

I gotta know tomorrow was it
Only yesterday
Don't tell me it's over
While you wipe my tears away

Can we ever make it right
Do I have a choice
Will you ever listen to me
Will you hear my voice

Now you say you want your freedom
You're gonna shy away
When you say there's no tomorrow
That's when I wanna say

Don't tell me it's over baby
Don't say goodbye
Don't want to live my life without you
You're my reason why

I gotta know tomorrow was it
Only yesterday
Don't tell me it's over
While you wipe my tears away
