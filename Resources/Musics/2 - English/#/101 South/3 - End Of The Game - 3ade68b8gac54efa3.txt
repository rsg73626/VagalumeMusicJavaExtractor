END OF THE GAME

I'm walking in sunshine
Been handed a lifeline
I'm living it up as far as I can recall
I was throwing it all away
A deal has been done now
I really don't know how
Everyone said it must have gone to his head
But I think that it's all right now

Everybody wants to know you
When you're doing fine
Everybody wanted to say
They were a good friend of mine
Fairweather friends disappear

When it's the end of the line
I've seen it all before
It's such a shame
But that's the end of the game
It's the end of the game

I was walking a tightrope
Living with no hope
It has to be sad
I was finding it strange
But I'm out of the danger zone
I was into my moonshine
And taking a straight line
I wish you could see
What was happening to me
But I know that it's all right now

Everybody wants to know you
When you're doing fine
Everybody wanted to say
They were a good friend of mine
Fairweather friends disappear

When it's the end of the line
I've seen it all before
It's such a shame
But that's the end of the game
It's the end of the game
