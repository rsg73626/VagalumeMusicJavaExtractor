HOW ABOUT TRUTH....?

How can you? It is not a sane incident.
Tell me the real reason.
I am seized with the past that I cannot love.

How about truth? Did you commit a crime?
Why are you here? I have a cloud in silent.
Give me time to think, just a little?

Once again. I will try to close my eyes.
Deep in the forest of memory.
There existed a sad scream and a gentle song.
The rainy night.

In fact I knew it all along.
The world not having paradise.
The world not having happiness.
All the people bring up an ideal, live for it and an expect death for it.

By all means.
Does even such a prayer become a crime?

Good night. I have a wonderful dream tonight.
A wonderful dream without I determine it, and come true.

In fact I knew it all along.
The world not having paradise.
The world not having happiness.
All the people bring up an ideal, live for it and an expect death for it.

To say good-bye.
The beautiful dream, an ideal world and the perfect future with me.

How can you?
