VENOM

I told lie against my will conscience
It's going to rain I'm afraid

Muzai houmen hinikou choushou boku wa ikiteru

So why are you ?
Suiside him hate loose

He gave vent to his anger in the speach
The judgement was against him

Kioku no kasuka na hakushi no HYUUBASU
Karamawarau suisai DESSAN wo
Dokueki de usumete muchuu de namewashita
Kouchoku shita inochi ga tashika ni ugoita

Why are you so angry ?
Answerme my question !!

Judgement the day of judgement

Boku wo tabereba damaru yokubari na houtei
Tsumi to batsu no amai Saute de

Yuuzai muzai uzai unzari
An error of judgement
