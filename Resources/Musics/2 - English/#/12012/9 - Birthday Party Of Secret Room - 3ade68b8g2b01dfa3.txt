BIRTHDAY PARTY OF SECRET ROOM

Serves you light. Bring it on! Are you fierce?
Serves you light. Bring it on! Are you fierce?

Isolation feelings
It lots away
We're got to get even

Time of the revenge came now

Isolation feelings
It lots away
We're got to get even

(To hate! To hate!)

Whatever you want
It's history
We're got to get even
Do you laugh at me, too?
The face says so it
We're got to get even

(To hate! To hate!)

Hey? Calling the my name
Hey? Calling the my name
Kanashi de na Ro-ra

Hey? Calling the my name
Hey? Calling the my name
Azawarau Ro-za

Birthday party of secret room~

I was considered to be a laughingstock
We're got to get even
Already stop it!
Leave from me!
There must not be you!

Serves you light. Bring it on! Are you fierce?
Serves you light. Bring it on! Are you fierce?
