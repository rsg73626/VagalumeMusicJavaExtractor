If I'm going to drop dead, it won't be that easy
Release the thing that you have kept locked up forever
Even I have my will and pride
I will bare my fangs my own way
Creeping death
Before the light goes out
Creeping death
Before the light goes out
I show fangs, crunch
When will this enormous darkness take over
Release the thing that you have kept locked up forever
Everyone scrutinizing
Everyone frivolously laughing
The next is my attack!
Bite!
Bofore the light goes out
I bite deeply
Before collapsing

Semari kuru dokuga no wana (poison turns around)
Mou kun wa nigedase nai (poison turns around)
Semari kuru dokuga no wana (poison turns around)
Koukotsu no emi wo uka be (poison turns around)

Fangs of the killer
Countdown to the death begins

Kake meguru sou uma no akari (poison turns around)
Mou kun wa nukedase nai (poison turns around)
Yomigaeru dejabu no naka de (poison turns around)
Mou kun wa itami moshinai (poison turns around)

Fangs of the killer
Countdown to the death begins
