BLACK RAIN

Black rain falls (will you tell me?)
Your heart is gone bad
Your heart is withered
Your heart is broken
Nobody listen to your voice (will you tell me?)
Your heart is gone bad
Your heart is withered
Your heart is broken
Nobody listen to your voice

You give up that flapping (flapping)
You are resigned to live (to live)
Tenshi no hane o sagashiteiru

Where if you go

Namida nagare hane ga kareochiru
Namida nagare hane ga kareochiru
(It does not matter I.)

Falls down fall down
The deeper and deeper
Falls down fall down
The deeper and deeper

Yami ni somaru kokoro sae mo aishi hajimeteita

Black rain falls kareta kokoro ni kuchizuke
Zouka no you na bibou ga kanashiku munashii
It's cold
It's cold
Utsukushii

Who are you? You are whether the I?
I know all of you
I know all of you
Help, help me
Help me help you for crying out loud
Lost
The disappear from inside the head
Black rain
Black rain pours me
