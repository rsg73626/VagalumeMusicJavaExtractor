THE SWIM

Is it ask myself that seen and felt till today everything
It's unknown everyone, but i notised just only a thing.
I'm breathing here, i'm standing this place now.
It cheat my existance at that days,
Now say thanks the past that i not found be aliving evidence.

The real pressing before one's eyes is very severe and sharp.
But an issue is escape from that or breakdown?
I escaped from everything till now
So i just saw over fear even an cut the passage named time.
But i must be continue swim in this passage. now.

I swimming never in sleeping. my never dream.
Kimi kara ataerareta monogatari, owari wo kimi to mukae
I swimming never in sleep. my never dream.
Kimi kara motomerareta monogatari owari wo kimi ni kaete
Will be end this story? not understand.

Ima nara yuruseru koko kara kimi wa hitori janai
Ayundekita kako ni te wo furu kedo
Ima nara yuruseru saigo no kotoba mune no kizu wa
Iyasarete kiete yuki te wo furu deshou

I swimming never in sleeping. my never dream.
Kimi kara ataerareta monogatari, owari wo kimi to mukae
I swimming never in sleep. my never dream.
Kimi kara motomerareta monogatari owari wo kimi ni kaete
Will be end this story? not understand.

Good bye kako no kizu
Good bye kako no boku
Good bye kako no namida
Good bye kako no omoi
Good bye koreijou
Good bye taerarenai
Good bye arigatou mata ne
