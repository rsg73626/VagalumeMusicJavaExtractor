THE SWAN

There's nothing left
Can you see what I'm feeling?
I just hide in my hand
Kanashimi ga itai yo
I wanna find the answers
Find the answers
Find the answers before I'm nothing
Ikiteru akashi ga hoshii koko ni iru yo

You see I'm finding a way
You see I'm finding a way
No reason to be alive now and nobody hears me
Don't leave me alone

Nigemado'u dake no hibi dareka no nukumori o kari nagusame
Gijiai sae wakaranaku natteyuku
It's the ugly duckling, the ugly duckling, the ugly duckling swimming in the lake
Uchinomesare obietsuzuke itami sae mo ai mo asu mo mienai

"Yoru ga akete asa ga kuru no"
Kimi wa itsumo sou itteita
Asa ga kureba kimi no kokoro mo ochitsuku kara
The darkness arrives and I see the light
It's just like the rain that beats my window
The lake is so calm, and I'm all alone
And someday
I'll be a beautiful swan

So until the day I fly
It will so many days to cry
But I will be forgetting how I die
We celebrate we're all alive

Will you
You'll know we want that one
You don't know
You don't know what I want
You just follow the others do
You don't know

Kanashikute kurushikute kuyashikute kuzureta hibi mo
Kimi o tsukuru hitotsu no youso de kimi ga iru
How loud I shout
How loud I cry
How sad I am
You will not get me
But I see the sky and someday
I might be something, so will you look at me for once?
For once
For once
Just once
The swan
