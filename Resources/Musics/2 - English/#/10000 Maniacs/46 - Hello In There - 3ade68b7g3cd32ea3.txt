HELLO IN THERE

[ John Prine ]

We had an apartment in the city 
Me and Loretta liked living there 
It'd been years since the kids had grown 
A life of their own
Left us alone 
John and Linda live in Omaha 
Joe is somewhere on the road 
We lost Davey in the Korean War 
And I still don't know what for 
dont matter anymore 

Chorus: 
You know that old trees grow stronger 
and old rivers grow wilder everyday 
old people, just grow lonesome 
waiting for someone to say Hello in There 
hello 

Me and Loretta we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the back door screen 
And all the news just repeats itself 
like some forgotten dream 
that we've both seen 
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory 
But what could I say if he asks "what's new?"
"nothin what's with you?" 
nothin much to do

Chorus 

So if you walking down the street some time
And spot some hollow ancient eyes 
Please don't just pass em by and stare
as if you didnt care
Say hello in there 
hello
