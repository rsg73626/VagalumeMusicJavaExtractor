SOMEBODY'S HEAVEN

There like a feather you fell someone's heaven above me floating
so fickle tempting me teasing my ways thrown from
its clutches I struggle to free what escapes me
Absalom hanging like you I'm caught in between heaven
then earth then heaven between you release me untangle my hair
Absalom hanging like you I'm caught in between heaven
then earth heaven between you patient I wait
as I hold a small feather that floated from somebody's heaven
