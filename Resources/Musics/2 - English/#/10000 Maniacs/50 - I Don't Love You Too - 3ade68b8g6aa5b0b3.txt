I DON'T LOVE YOU TOO

Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well the music plays
And you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer
And now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you
Well the room is crowded
There's people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown
Take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away
I think that we could make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you
I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late
You'd like some some company

Well I've had two, I look at you
And you look back at me
The guy you're with has up and split
The chair next to you's free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Turn around to look at you
You're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face
Guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you
