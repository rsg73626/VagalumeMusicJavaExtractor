TIME TURNS

I saw time turn so much there to unlearn,
you were envy you wouldn't say you tore heart strings
that sorry day dark light hid the tears one for each of the years
love has reasons reason never knows
time turns over love overflows I should have spoken sooner
on that sorry day your arms are open
and I wondered why
wondered why
five years passed to the day time heals some people say
when you hurt the ones I love you're also hurting me
and time turns over turning you from me I thought you'd never reach me
on that sorry day your arms were open wide and I wondered why
