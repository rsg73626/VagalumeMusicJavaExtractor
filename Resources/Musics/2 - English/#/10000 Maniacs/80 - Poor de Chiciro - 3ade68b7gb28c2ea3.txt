POOR DE CHICIRO

[ Lombardo/Merchant ]



Oh my dear friend 
My dear friend Giorgio 
How has this time Breton 
Discouraged your liaison with the 
Eye styled metaphysical 
Incongruous scenarios 
Dauntly jaunt about through nostalgic despair 
Within childlike renderings 
Of a nightmarish recall 
"All my images Fragments 
I've shored upon my ruins 
Pictor classicus sum 
I am pure" 
Step solemn with the 
Air of reluctant manes 
As rod and hoop shadow children 
Scatter through a henna arcade 
Figures indentured to a windless landscape 
Enduring silence and flame 
Da Da da 
No loyalty to the nonsensical 
Scorned their nihilist pageantry
