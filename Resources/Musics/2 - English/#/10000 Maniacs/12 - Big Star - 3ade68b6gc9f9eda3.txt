BIG STAR

I saw a big star running from me,
a world from a record on my bed.
Turn the tables on me,
what would happen if I fell to the tune of a dreamer,
to the tune of my heart?
A big start running from me,
I saw a world out sunning on my head.
Turn the tables on me now.
I would fall from heaven and ring your bell.
Baby, catch me in the middle of a lie.
The boys are out tonight,
yeah the boys are out tonight.
The big shots singin' from me,
I saw a world out sunning on my head.
Pity my heart signals:
center of a storm inside my head.
Center of my heart,
center of my out of time simple mind.
From the moon out my window a wink and a blink and a nod.
Had a wish on a start but now it's falling.
The boys are out tonight,
big skies above me signal in my horoscope it said:
never heed a caution,
never fought a lover,
never cross a street alone in the middle of a signal red,
middle of a drinker's heart,
middle of a big parade,
a signal in my horoscope.
