TO SIR, WITH LOVE

[original version by Lulu] 

Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone 
But in my mind I know they will still live on and on 
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to 
perfume? 
It isn't easy but I'll try 

If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky 
In letters that would soar a thousand feet high 
To Sir, With Love 

The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end 
And as I leave, I know that I am leaving my best friend 
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong 
That's a lot to learn - what can I give you in return? 
If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start 
But I would rather you let me give my heart 
To Sir, With Love 

Those awkward years have hurried by - why do they fly away? 
Why is it, sir, that children grow up to be people one day? 
What takes the place of climbing trees and dirty knees in the world 
outside? 
What is there for you I can buy? 

If you wanted the world I'd surround it with a wall 
I'd scrawl in words with letters ten feet tall 
To Sir, With Love
