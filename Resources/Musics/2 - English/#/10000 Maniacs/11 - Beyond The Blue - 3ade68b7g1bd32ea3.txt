BEYOND THE BLUE

[ 10,000 Maniacs ]


[ unreleased song on Euro and Australian MTT CDS ] 

I was thinking today 
if you would remember 
you'd choose to remember 
what you left me out there in the cold 

Days fading away 
I see you so near 
I hear your voice calling 
it calls me from these pages to you 

Beyond the blue 
so sudden too soon 
secrets we knew 

And I was thinking today 
if you would surrender 
you'd choose to surrender 
to feelings that you tried deserting 

And if given the choice 
I'd still wait for the moment 
still wait for the moment 
when I could have a hero like you 

Beyond the blue 
so sudden too soon 
secrets we knew 

Days are fading away 
but I see you clear 
I hear your voice calling 
it calls me from these pages to you 

Beyond the blue 
so sudden too soon 
secrets we knew
