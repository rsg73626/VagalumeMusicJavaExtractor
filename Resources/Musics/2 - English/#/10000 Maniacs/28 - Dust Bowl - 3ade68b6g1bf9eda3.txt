DUST BOWL

I should know to leave them home. They follow me through the store
with these toys I can't afford. "Kids, take them back, you know better than
that." Dolls that talk, astronauts, T.V. games, airplanes, they don't
understand and how can I explain? I try and try but I can't save. Pennies,
nickels, dollars slip away. I've tried and tried but I can't save.
My youngest girl has bad fever, sure. All night with alcohol to cool
and rub her down. Ruby, I'm tired, try and get some sleep. I'm adding
doctor's fees to remedies with the cost of three day's work lost. I try and try
but I can't save. Pennies, nickels, dollars slip away. I've tried and
tried but I can't save. The hole in my pocketbook is growing.
There's a new wind blowing they say, it's gonna be a cold, cold one.
So brace yourselves my darlings, it won't bring anything much our way but
more dust bowl days.
I played a card in this weeks game. Took the first and the last
letters in three of their names. This lottery's been building up for weeks. I
could be lucky me with the five million prize, tears of disbelief spilling out
of my eyes. I try and try but I can't save. Pennies, nickels, dollars slip
away. I've tried and tried but I can't save. The hole in my pocketbook is
growing. There's a new wind blowing they say, it's gonna be a cold, cold one.
So brace yourselves my darlings, it won't bring anything much our way but
more dust bowl days.
