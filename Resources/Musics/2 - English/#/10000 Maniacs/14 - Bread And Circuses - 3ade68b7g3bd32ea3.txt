BREAD AND CIRCUSES

[ Billy Bragg and Natalie Merchant ]



Crowds gather round kneeling at the feet of common thieves 
Hungry for the word, but God would never speak through such as these, 
such as these 
who offer healing hands and balms, and redemption, a few would cross 
their palms 
They'll tell your troubles to the Lord for how ever much you can afford 

Hands holding hands in the circle of the sinners and the saints 
Memories that linger from the cradle, placing puzzles in the grave, 
in the grave 
No mortal skin and bone can live on bread and circuses alone 
The spirit needs, must drive the mystery of why you're alive 

CHORUS: 

They look and their Book and they read 
But their cold hearts say, "Follow me" 

Dance in the dust in the frenzy of the desperately in need 
Led by the voices of the men who invoke ritual to hide their greed, 
hide their greed 
Come every tongue, every eye across the crumbling earth and cracking skies 
The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single 
file 

(Chorus) 

These men make a cage for the very souls that came here to be free 

They turn off their lights for their tents they're fixing to leave 

(Instrumental) 

Follow me 

(Chorus 2x) 

They'll close their Book and leave, but you'll remain still in pain
