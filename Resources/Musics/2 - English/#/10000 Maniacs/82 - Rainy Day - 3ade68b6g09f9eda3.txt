RAINY DAY

On bended kneeI've looked through every window then.
Touched the bottom, the night a sleepless day instead
A day when love came,came easy like what's lost now found.
Beneath a blinding light that would surround.
We were without, in doubt
We were about saving for a rainy day.
I crashed through mirrors,
I crashed through floors of laughter then.
In a blind scene, no ties would moor us to this room.
A day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found.
And you would save me, and I held you like you were my child.
If I were you, defiant you, alone upon a troubled way.
I would send my heart to you
To save it for a rainy day.
