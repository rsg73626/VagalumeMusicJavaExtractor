BECAUSE THE NIGHT

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, and try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Cause the night belongs to us

Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring a telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep,
with doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns
Without you, oh I cannot live,
forgive the yearning burning
I believe it's time to heal to feel,
so take me now, take me now, take me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
