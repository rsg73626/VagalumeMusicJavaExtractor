PIT VIPER

in the cruel garrison of affection
if worth of lore is true
you know the face of a temptress
pit viper

a witch or enchantress
pit viper

with the malign venom of conceit
she tries
civil men
conceal fear
misgivings
when night entreats them
a greater chill sustains
stains her
darkness
shall not inhibit death blow

know this skin does not restrict her
tear and shed the coil
fall of garland leaves
below the soil
