SMALLEST STEP

When the day ends and church bells are ringing
when the valley is shrouded in snow,
when you're feeling that hope somewhere vanished
and there's no poetry left to console you,
with the smallest step you'll find a way oh of fate borne
and life is a jewel but stone will tarnish as dust will descend take a minute
and wipe free the lustre,
it'll mirror a day without end with the smallest step you'll feel
it starts a journey your way.
oh they tried to tell me but I'll learn for myself
and when they tried to tell me you know the words disappeared
on the wind I was running away
and when the laughter echoes through you in a pale beaming ray
and you'll know always and ever within you anyway
