EVEN WITH MY EYES CLOSED

Even with my eyes closed,
Funny how I know
it's harder, it's harder now.
Young girl
in my young girl days,
thinking I could live for always.
But like an ocean tide,
I'm drawn back inside
and I know.
Seasons pass
like sand inside a glass
and nothing, nothing returns.
Standing with the friends I've made,
I'll race them to the grave.
Well who won,
won the extra days?
But like an ocean tide,
I'm drawn back inside...
But like an ocean tide,
I'm drawn back inside
and I know.
When you the years toll
on the waters wide,
shallow high and low.
In the autumn sky,
happy to know I'm going home.
Even with my eyes closed,
funny how I know
it's finally,
has it finally begun?
But like an ocean tide,
I'm drawn back inside...
But like an ocean tide,
I'm drawn back inside
and I know...
and I know...
and I know...
