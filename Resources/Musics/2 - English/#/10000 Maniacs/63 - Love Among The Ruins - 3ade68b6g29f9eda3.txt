LOVE AMONG THE RUINS

The sky was falling, heaven was calling.
When danger crashes, rose from the ashes.
Like two statues hidden inside ancient rock,
We were praying for the secrets to unlock.
And when the sun had turned its back on us,
In the dark our love kept track of us,
Pushed together by the lack of love.
We held each other tightly through our hell of dreams.
I still hear the never-ending echo of those screams.
But it's a life not made for reliving,
Its a life that makes your soul forgiving.
We sealed our bond from the beginning.
Aching, affection, vulnerable protection;
Falling, captured, crawling, rapture.
