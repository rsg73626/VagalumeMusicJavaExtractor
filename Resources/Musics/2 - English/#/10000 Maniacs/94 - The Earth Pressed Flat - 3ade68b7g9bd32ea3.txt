THE EARTH PRESSED FLAT

Detroit, l.a.,boston, san francisco,
First time over the ocean on a plane
A billion stars below me lay,
Circle slowly jfk,
So much there to see inside of a week
They came looking for something new
Try to press it flat inside of a few days
Old dominion saturday, arlington's eternal flame
Sunday tour niagara falls in the mist.
Monday I'll be heading south
New orleans the cajun sound
Tuesday's tupelo elvis's home . . .
Try to press it flat inside of a few days
What a wonderful stay,
On a mule grand canyon ride on wednesday,
Hope to get to denver in a day friday
Ride to washington, in the glacial mountain sun
Hop a train for canada to the east
They came looking for something new
Try to press it flat inside of a few days
What a wonderful stay.
