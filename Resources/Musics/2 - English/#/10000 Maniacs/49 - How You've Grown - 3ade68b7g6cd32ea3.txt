HOW YOU'VE GROWN

[ Merchant ]


[ viola: Mary Ramsey ] 

"My, how you've grown." 
I remember that phrase from my childhood days too. 
"Just wait and see." 
I remember those words and how they chided me, when patient was the hardest thing to be. 
Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost, I must let these memories provide. 
No little girl can stop her world to wait for me. 

I should have known. 
At your age, in a string of days the year is gone. 
But in that space of time, it takes so long. 
Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost, I must let those memories provide. 
No little girl can stop her world to wait for me. 

Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind as the child that you never will be, you never will be again. 
I'll never be more to you than a stranger could be. 

Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind as a child that you never will be, will be again.
