CIRCLE DREAM

I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.
And in that circle I had made were all
the worlds unformed and unborn yet.
A volume, a sphere that was the earth,
that was the moon, that did revolve around my room.
I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.
And in that circle was a maze,
a terrible spiral to be lost in.
Blind in my fear,
I was escaping just by feel.
But at every turn my way was sealed.
I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.
And in that circle was a face.
Her eyes looked upon me with fondness.
Her warmth coming near,
calling me "sweetness," calling me "dear."
But I whispered, "no, I can't rest here."
I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.
