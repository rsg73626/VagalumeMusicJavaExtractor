GLOW

In the coolness of the morning sparing moments here in magical tide
I would meet you without question to share a starry gaze
a look through the sky from the start there was this kind of glow the start
when it's right you'll know,
fascinating love's a secret an ancient riddle with no reason
or rhyme unpredictable the muses
they play never knowing whether teasing or shy
