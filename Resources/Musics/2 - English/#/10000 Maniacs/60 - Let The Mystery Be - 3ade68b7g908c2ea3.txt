LET THE MYSTERY BE

[ Iris DeMent ]


[ From her debut album: Infamous Angel ] 

Chorus: 
Everybody's wondering what and where they all came from 
Everybody's worrying 'bout where they're gonna go 
When the whole thing's done 
Nobody knows for certain, 
And so it's all the same to me 
I Think I'll just let the mystery be 

Some say once gone, you're gone forever 
Some say you're gonna come back 
Some say you rest in the arms of the Savior 
if in sinful ways you lack 
Some say that they're comin' back in a garden 
Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas 
I Think I'll just let the mystery be 

Some say they're going to place called Glory 
And I ain't sayin' it ain't a fact 
But I've heard that I'm on the road to purgatory 
And I don't like the sound of that 
I believe in love and I live my life accordingly 
But I choose to let the mystery be
