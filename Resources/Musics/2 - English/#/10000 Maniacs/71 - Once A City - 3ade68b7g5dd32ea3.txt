ONCE A CITY

Music by 10,000 Maniacs - Lyrics by Mary Ramsey & John Lombardo 

This was once a city 
harmony a common theme 
but these complications
now make life a bit uneasy
hallowed buildings scrape the sky 
voices ride the airwaves 
once a city years gone by 
will they still be standing in thecenturies ahead 
going underground little children hiding, 
bullets never meant for them 
must there be such bloodshed in our hearts, our homes, ourheads?
will I be walking, walking so free?
this was a city once 
this was once a city 
harmony a common theme but these complications
once a city, once a dream.
