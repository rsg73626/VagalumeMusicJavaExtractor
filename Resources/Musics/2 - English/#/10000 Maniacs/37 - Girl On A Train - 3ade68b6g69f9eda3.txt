GIRL ON A TRAIN

Waking on a train dreaming, charmed alone they started speaking.
Captured in his artist way before the memories fade away.
To remember a face, and you're home or want to.
Certain they would meet soon, paint a portrait of a family.
Sigle light on, single way, single light away.
The night fell.
Saw a painting on the stairwell to mourn the passing of a daughter dear.
Her soul upon the train so far so near.
Just close your eyes and you're home.
