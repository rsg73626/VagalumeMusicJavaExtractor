FROM THE TIME WE SAY GOODBYE

by the time you say goodbye 
by the time you say cheerio 
we'll take a handshake through 
on your journey as you go 
keep a pray'r within your heart 
that the time will surely fly 
to the day when we shall meet again 
by the time you say goodbye 

hmmm..... 

yes listeners, we have been coming to you 
live on a crystal ballroom high above the Hotel Jamestown 
in picturesque western new york 
as your program draws to a close 
it gives me profound pleasure to say cheerio 
to the strains of Miss Natalie Merchant and her choir 
and so now it only remains for me to say... goodnight 

by the time you say goodbye 
by the time you say cheerio 
we'll take a handshake through 
on your journey as you go 
keep a pray'r within your heart 
that the time will surely fly 
to the day when we shall meet again 
by the time you say goodbye
