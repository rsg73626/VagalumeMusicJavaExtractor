THE LION'S SHARE

[ music: Natalie Merchant & Dennis Drew/words: Natalie Merchant ]



Can I be unhappy? 
Look at what I see: a beast in furs and crowned in luxury. 
He's a wealthy man in the poorest land, a self-appointed king, 
and there's no complaining while he's reigning. 
The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told. 
There must be some creature mighty as you are. 
The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share. 
There must be some creature mighty as you are. 

Can I be unhappy? 
Listen and agree, no words can shame him or tame him. 
The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told. 
There must be some creature mighty as you are. 
The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share. 
There must be some creature mighty as you are, as you are. 

Razor claws in velvet paws, you dunce in your guarded home, 
'til a stronger beast will call on you and pounce upon your throne. 

Do we pay? Dearly, for the lion takes so greedily 
and he knows that what he's taken, it is ours. 
That's how the wealth's divided among the lambs and king of the beasts, it is so one-sided. 
Until the lamb is king of the beasts we live so one-sided.
