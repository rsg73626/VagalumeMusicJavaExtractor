DEATH OF MANOLETE

There were women holding
rosaries On the day Manolette died Teenage girls in soft white dresses
Standing silent peace respecting Groups of boys held in their hands
The fragments of a shattered idol The old men with their traditions
challenged Refrained from tears Neck neck hook Poles of wood The
Picadores stood eyes ablaze To view brutal contest In the vale of
years Courage unfailing Agility exhausted Youth entered challenge
Reached for title shelved Patrons in attendance To disarm a common
myth Homage played to the victor of immortality Cloaked in bold tones
In the stockyard the beasts Did climb their barriers Bid by a frenzied
ring Bred for one purpose only To die in man's sport Dash against his
spindle An instant fell to wounding On the day Swords penetrating On
the day Torches igniting On the day Flower wreaths encircling The day
On the day.
