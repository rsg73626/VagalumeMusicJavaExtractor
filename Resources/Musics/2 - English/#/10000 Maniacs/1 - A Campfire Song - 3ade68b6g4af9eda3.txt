A CAMPFIRE SONG

A lie to say, "O my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig.
500 men with axes and they all dig for me." A lie to ssay, "O my
river where mant fish do swim, half of the catch is mine when you haul
your nets in." Never will he believe that his greed is a blinding
ray. No devil or redeemer will cheat him. He'll take his gold to
where he's lying cold.
A lie to say, "O my mine gave a diamond as big as a fist."
But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed. A lie to
say, "O my garden is growing taller by the day." He only eats the
best and tosses the rest away. Never will he be believe that his
greed is a blinding ray. No devil or redeemer can cheat him. he'll
take his gold to where he's lying cold. Six deep in the grave.
Something is out of reach
something he wanted
something is out of reach
he's being taunted
something is out of reach
that he can' beg or steal nor can he buy
his oldest pain
and fear in life
there'll not be time
his oldest pain
and fear in life
there'll not be time
A lie to say "O my forest has trees that block the sun and
when I cut them down I don't answer to anyone." No, no, never will he
believe that his greed is a blinding ray no devil or redeemer can
cheat
him. He'll take his gold where he's lying cold.
