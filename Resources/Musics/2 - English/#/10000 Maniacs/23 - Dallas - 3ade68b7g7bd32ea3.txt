DALLAS

Chorus:
Did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night?
Dallas is a jewel
Yeah, dallas is a beautiful sight
Dallas is a jungle
But dallas gives a beautiful light
Did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night?

Now dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you’re down
But when you are up she’s the kind you wanna take around
Now dallas ain’t a woman to help you get your feet on the ground
And dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you’re down

Oh, I came into dallas with the bright lights on my mind
I came into dallas with a dollar and a dime

Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes
A steel concrete soul with a warm-hearted love in disguise
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies
I say, dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his yes

Oh, I came into dallas with the brights lights on my mind
I came into dallas with a dollar and a dime
