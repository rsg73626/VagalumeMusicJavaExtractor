WHEN WE WALKED ON CLOUDS

Everybody's wondering what
And where they all came from
Everybody's worrying 'bout
Where they're gonna go
When the whole thing's done
Nobody knows for certain
So it's all the same to me
Think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say once gone, you're gone forever
Some say they're gonna come back
Some say you rest in the arms of the savior
If in sinful ways you lack
Some say that they're comin' back in a garden
Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas

Think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say they're going to place called "glory"
And I ain't sayin' it ain't a fact
But I've heard that I'm on the road to purgatory
And I don't like the sound of that
I believe in love and I live my life accordingly
But I choose to let the mystery be
