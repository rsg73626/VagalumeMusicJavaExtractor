WILDWOOD FLOWER

i will twine with your mingles of raven black hair 
with the roses so red and the lilies so fair 
with myrtle as bright as the emerald dew 
the pale and the lyd-er and eyes of light blue 

oh he promised to love me; he promised to love 
and to cherish me always all others above. 
i woke from my dream and my idol was clay 
my passion for loving had vanished away. 

oh he taught me to love him; he called me his flower 
a blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour 
but now he is gone and left me alone 
the wild flowers to weep and the wild birds to mourn. 

i will dance and i'll sing and my life shall be gay 
i will charm every heart and each crown I shall sway 
though my heart now is breaking he never shall know 
how his name makes me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow. 

i will dance and i'll sing and my heart will be gay 
i'll banish this weeping, drive troubles away. 
i'll live yet to see him regret this dark hour 
when we won and neglected this frail wildwood flower.
