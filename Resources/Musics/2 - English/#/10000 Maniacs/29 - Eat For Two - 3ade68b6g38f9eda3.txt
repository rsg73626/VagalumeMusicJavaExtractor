EAT FOR TWO

Oh,
Baby blankets and
Baby shoes,
Baby slippers,
Baby spoons,
Walls of baby blue

Dream child in my head 
Is a nightmare born 
In a borrowed bed

Now I know
Lightning strikes again
It struck me once,
Then struck me dead

My folly grows inside of me

I eat for two,
Walk for two,
Breathe for two, now
Walk for two,
Breathe for two,
Eat for two, now

Well, the egg man
Fell down off his shelf
All the good king's men
With all their help
Struggled 'til the end
For a shell
They couldn't mend

You know
Where this will lead,
To hush and rock
In the nursery
For the kicking
One inside of me

I eat for two, 
Walk for two, 
Breathe for two, now
Eat for two,
Walk for two,
Breathe for two, now

When the boy
Was a boy,
The girl
Was a girl,
They found 
Each other in
A wicked world

Strong in some respects,
But she couldn't stand
For the way he begged
And gave in

Pride is for men
Young girls
Should run and 
Hide instead

You risk the game 
By taking dares with "yes"

I eat for two,
Walk for two,
Breathe for two, now
Eat for two,
Walk for two,
Breathe for two, now

I walk for two
I'm stumbling
I walk for two
I'm stumbling
Breathe for two
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Five months,
How it grows
Five months now,
I begin to show
