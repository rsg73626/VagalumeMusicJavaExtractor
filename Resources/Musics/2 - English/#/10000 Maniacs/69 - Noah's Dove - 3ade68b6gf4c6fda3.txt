NOAH'S DOVE



You win a prize for that, for telling lies like that so well that I
believed it. I never felt cheated. You were the chosen one, the pure
eyes
of Noah's dove. Choir boys and angles stole your lips and your halo.
In your reckless mind, you act as if you've got more lives. In your
reckless eyes, you only have time and your love of danger -- to it
your no
stranger.
In that August breeze of those forgotten trees, your time was set for
leaving, come a colder season. In your reckless mind, you act as if
you've
got more lives. In your reckless eyes, it's never too late for a
chance to
seize some final breath of freedom. Very, so very wise. Don't reveal
it.
I'm tired, tired of knowing where it is you're going.
In your reckless mind, you act as if you've got more lives. In your
reckless eyes, you only have time and your love of danger -- to it
you're
no stranger.
In your reckless mind, you act as if you've got more lives. In your
reckless eyes, it's never too late for a chance to seize some final
breath
of freedom.
