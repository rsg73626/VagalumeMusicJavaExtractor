CABARET

Music by 10,000 Maniacs - Lyrics by Mary Ramsey 

Shards of glass cut through my gaze 
broken streamers hanging at my legs
drunk and giddy full of fate 
at the cabaret 
smokey stares from the bar
do stray bottles tumble 
I feel the misty spray 
what a perfect, perfect day for the cabaret 
from afar he sees 
Venus rise overwhelmingly beautiful
he sighs the look of love was in her eyes 
puts his hand upon her leg 
looking closer his lust begins to fade 
what a drag the queen did say. 
could this be a dream Iâ€™m in? ( Fellini would be proud ) 
gluttony enfolds the scene
give them one last round, shining faces dance away 
swinging skirts between the panted legs 
kaleidescoping 
then shassez in a blink the glasses fly
suddenly joy becomes a fight 
there they tossed and turned a sight.
