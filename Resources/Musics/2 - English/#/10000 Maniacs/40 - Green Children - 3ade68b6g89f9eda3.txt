GREEN CHILDREN

An Augist day in the hills of Spain,
a pair of children emerged from a cave.
The strangest sight there alone they stood,
with skin of green and words no one had heard.
The girl was stronger, the boy was weak,
with her new mother she learned to speak.
And wove a tale of a dying sun,
they had left darkness, a dark world come undone.
They travelled so far.
Believing they came from a star.
She fell through life, through time, through parallel lives.
The men of science, the men of fame,
the men of letters tried to explain:
Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time
to make her think she'd fallen from the sky?
A whirlwind spun them all alone,
took them from their twilight home.
Believing they came from a star.
