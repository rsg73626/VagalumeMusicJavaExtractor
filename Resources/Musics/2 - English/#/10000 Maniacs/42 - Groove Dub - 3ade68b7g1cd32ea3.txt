GROOVE DUB

[ music: John Lombardo/lyric: Natalie Merchant ]



imitate that soured old song 

there is no individuality 
only guises 
shades of 
nonconformity 
there is no individuality 
selling vantage points 
low rate 
there is no individuality 
questions ancient 
no words claimed 
perform motions borrowed 
thoughts following 
ima tima ima tima intima 
dation 
respected 
head-he-go-round-men 
gesture display 
customer 
limits appeal 
media dictates the latest 
role 
totalitarian 
motions borrowed 
selling vantage points 
low rate 
for you 
media begged 
suffered 
numbers 
pain
