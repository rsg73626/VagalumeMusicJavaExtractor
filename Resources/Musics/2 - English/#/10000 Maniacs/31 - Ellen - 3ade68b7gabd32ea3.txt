ELLEN

Eager to please was just the way that he was 
though his attempts there falling short, 
expectation 
see he would tell of all his conquests,
was he bragging?

but in the evening all alone 
Ellen unplanned delays 
saving for someone who really cared about you 
invincible they say 

married to your name 
she was the kind between a child and a lady, 
quick was her temper
like a blaze from an ember

no one had measured to her standard, 
so in the evening all alone all alone
how do I tell them to open their minds 
and to take a chance

maybe on finding life`s treasure stubborn 
they stay set in their ways
really not wanting to be lonely not alone.
