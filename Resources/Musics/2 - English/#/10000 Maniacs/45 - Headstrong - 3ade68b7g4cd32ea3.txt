HEADSTRONG

[ music: Natalie Merchant/words: Natalie Merchant ]



To your common sense firm arguments 
I won't listen to your voice of reason trying to change my mind. 
I mind my feelings and not your words. 
Didn't you notice I'm so headstrong even when I know I'm wrong? 
Take this to your heart and into your head now: 
before you waste your time, call a truce and call a draw. 

What's the use in mapping your views out in orderly form 
when it does nothing but confuse and anger me more? 
I mind my feelings and not your words. 
Didn't you notice I'm so headstrong. 
You're talking to a deaf stone wall. 
Take this to your heart and into your head now: 
the old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it. 
All is fair in love and war, that's how the famous saying goes. 

Open up your eyes, see me for what I am: 
cast in iron, I won't break and I won't bend. 
Take this to your heart and into your head now: 
the old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it. 
All is fair in love and war, that's how the famous saying goes. 

If I told you we were out to sea in a bottomless boat, 
you'd try anything to save us, you'd try anything to keep us afloat. 
And if we were living in a house afire, 
I don't believe that you could rush out and escape it and not rescue me. 
Take this to your heart and into your head now: 
the old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it. 
All is fair in love and war, that's how the famous saying goes. 
Listen, I think they were talking to you.
