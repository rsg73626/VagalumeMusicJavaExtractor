SALLY ANN

A woman of beauty
A woman of pain
In france or jakarta
Her shadowâ€™s the same

Chorus:
You go home with sally ann
You go home with sally ann
You go home

A woman of kindness
With bracelets of jade
In china or japan
Her choices are made

Chorus

A woman of chances
No family or friends
In argentina
She knows only men

Chorus

A woman of color
Debts to be paid
In trenton or detroit
She lives by the blade
