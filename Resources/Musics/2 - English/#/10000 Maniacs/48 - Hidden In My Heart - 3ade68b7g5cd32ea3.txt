HIDDEN IN MY HEART

Music by 10,000 Maniacs - Lyrics by Mary Ramsey & John Lombardo 

I see the leaves of autumn 
changing, falling, turning what was green 
I see a door standing open, 
open to curiosity 
we could be together 
tear it all apart 
would you ever notice 
what was hidden in my heart 
heartstrong
do we ever listen 
closely as willows start to weep 
there as we stood upon the threshold 
who said forever was for keeps? 
would you ever notice what
was hidden in my heart, 
my deep heart is reeling forward 
and steady on to keep,
who made me miss the last ferry?
who made this river so deep?
