IF YOU INTEND

[ Merchant ]



If you intend to live again, 
then open your eyes and don't pretend you're feeling there's nothing worth believing. 

God, if you persist you'll die like this, 
and wither in the midst of your first season, 
cut down with no reason. 
How can you be so near and not see everything? 

If you intend to live again, 
then take the outstreched hand of the one that needs you. 
It's been so long, we've missed you. 
Why do you intend to speed your end? 
Lie in the dark and let your limbs grow weaker, sinking low then deeper. 
How can you be so near and not see everything? 

Feel what might be. See what I see. 
Again and again and again and again say you don't. 
You say you don't, but you will. 
How can you be so near and not see?
