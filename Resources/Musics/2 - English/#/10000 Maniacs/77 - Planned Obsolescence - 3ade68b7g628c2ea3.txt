PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE

[ music: Dennis Drew/lyric: Natalie Merchant ]



science 
is truth for life 
watch religion fall obsolete 
science 
will be truth for life 
technology as nature 
science 
truth for life 
in fortran tongue the 
answer 

with wealth and prominence 
man so near perfection 
possession 
it's an absence of interim 
secure no demurrer 
defense against divine 
defense against his true 
image 
human conflict number five 
discovery 
dissolved all illusion 
mystery 
destroyed with conclusion 
and illusion never restored 

any modern man can see 
that religion is 
obsolete 

piety 
obsolete 
ritual 
obsolete 
martyrdom 
obsolete 
prophetic vision 
obsolete 
mysticism 
obsolete 
commitment 
obsolete 
sacrament 
obsolete 
revelation 
obsolete
