FEW AND FAR BETWEEN

Times are far between,
and few I bet,
when we can look upon our lives
without regret.
Of all the things I have done,
you think I'm proud
of everyone
without exception?
'Till you make your peace with yesterday,
you'll never build a future.
I swear by what I say.
Whatever penance you do,
decide what it's worth to you
and then respect it.
However long it will take
to weather your mistakes,
why not accept it?
My hands, for now, are tied.
I'm a body frozen.
I'm a will that's paralyzed.
When will you ever set aside your pain and misery?
No matter how I beg,
no matter how I wish or plead,
you'll never be more than alive.
You'll never do more than survive
until you expect it.
Do you want to build a
world with our lives?
You better soon decide
or you can forget it.
My hands, for now, are tied.
I'm a body frozen.
I'm a will that's paralyzed.
'Till you drop that heavy baggage
you're dragging behind,
there won't be room
for us to both go this ride.
