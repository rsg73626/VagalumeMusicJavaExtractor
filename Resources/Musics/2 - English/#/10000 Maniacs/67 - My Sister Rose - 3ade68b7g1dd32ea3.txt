MY SISTER ROSE

[ Jerome Augustyniak/Natalie Merchant ]



Big plans are being made for my sisters wedding day. 
We'll have a ball at the Sons of Roma Hall. 
Family, friends come one and all. 
First the best man makes a toast to Rocky and my sister Rose, 
"A life of years free of tears. Bottoms up and lots of luck!" 
` 
Polka, tango everyone, cha-cha, mambo Rose and Rock alone. 
Frankie Rizzo and his Combo play on. 

Single girls all hear the call from a crowd at the back wall 
and when the bouquet flies each one tries to be the best catch and next years bride. 
Uncle Sam and Uncle Joe take their places in the row. 
They're standing by side to side for dollar dances with the bride. 

Polka, tango everyone, cha-cha, mambo, Rose and Rock alone. 
"He's a banker, she'll be well off now." 

Sister Rose take your mother's place. 
Trade your home and your maiden name. 
For a list of vows and a veil of lace made a wife of you today. 

Now they cut the five tier cake, "That Colucci, he can bake." 
A frosted tower of sugar and flour for the couple of the hour. 

Polka, tango everyone, cha-cha, mambo Rose and Rock alone. 
She was born to wear that gown. 

Sister Rose take your mother's place. 
Trade your home and your maiden name. 
For a list of vows and a veil of lace made a wife of you today, 
but you're my sister Rose the same.
