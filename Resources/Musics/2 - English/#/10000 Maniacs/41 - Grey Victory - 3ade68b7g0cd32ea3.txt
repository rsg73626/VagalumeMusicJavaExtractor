GREY VICTORY

there was light
and atomic fission
swelling wind and
rising ash
tide of black rain
cement seared shadow traces
reminiscent of their
last commands

instantly one thousand
flames arising
ill scent of
burning hides surrounding
a settlement
debased entirely

Enola Gay had made a casual delivery

please build a future darling
with our bomb
cherish and love it
for the sake of
earth bound kingdom come

the undersides of
fallen metal trusses
evil debris of
human bodies
each window's glass
shards pelted
secure confines
brittle collapse
neighbors lay beside
each other unknowing
faces scorched
of all familiar bearing
too few hands
wounds for closing
marred by thirsting
anguish
fear
lamenting

here we stand
at the door to
Gold Atomic Age
don't spoil your faces with worry
trust in earth bound kingdom come
