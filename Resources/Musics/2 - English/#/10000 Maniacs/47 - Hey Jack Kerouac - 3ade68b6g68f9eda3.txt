HEY JACK KEROUAC

Hey Jack Kerouac
I think of you mother
And all the tears she cried
She would cry for none other
Than her little boy lost in a little world that hated
And that dared to drag him down
Her little boy courageous

He chose his words from mouths of
Babes got lost in the world
The hip-flash slinging madmen
Steaming café flirts
They all spoke through you

Hey Jack, now for the tricky part
When you were the brightest star
Who were the shadows?
Of the San Francisco beat boys
You were the favourite
Now they sit and rattle their bones
And think of their blood stoned days

You chose your words from mouths of
Babes got lost in the world
The hip-flask slinging madmen
Steaming café flirts
In Chinatown, howling at night

Allen baby, why so jaded?
Have the boys all grown up
and their beauty faded?
Billy, what a saint they made you
You're just like Mary down in Mexico
On All Souls' Day

You chose your words from mouths of
Babes lost in the world
The cool junk booting madmen
Street minded girls
In Harlem, howling at night

What a tear stained shock of the world
You've gone away without saying
Goodbye
