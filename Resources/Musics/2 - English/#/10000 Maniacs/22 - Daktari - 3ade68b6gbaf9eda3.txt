DAKTARI

Like a weasel in the clover You tilt toss
pop turn over Sit down Tremble and weave like a moth By flame deceived
Sit down Spill with your words caught up Dance in your room Slide like
you're buttered up Roll back the tomb Sit down Bolt scuff jilt chase
circle riddle Shake in haste Sit down When the thunderclouds sound
Ants scatter to high ground.
