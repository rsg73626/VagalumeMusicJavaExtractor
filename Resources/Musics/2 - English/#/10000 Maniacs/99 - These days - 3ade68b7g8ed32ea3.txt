THESE DAYS

[ Jackson Browne ]



I've been out walking 
I don't do too much talking these days 
these days, these days I seem to think a lot 
about the things that I forgot to do for you 
and all the times I had the chance to 

I had a lover 
well I don't think I'll risk another these days 
these days if I seem to be afraid to live the life 
that I had made in song 
well it's just, it's just that I've been losing so long 

looong...well.... 

I stop my dreaming 
I won't do too much scheming these days 
these days, these days I sit on cornerstones 
and count the time quarter to's 'til ten, my friend 
please don't confront me with my failures 
I have not forgotten them
