JOLENE

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
I'm begging of you please don't take my man 
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Please don't take him just because you can 

Your beauty is beyond compare 
with flaming locks of auburn hair 
ivory skin and eyes of emerald green 
Your smile is like a breath of spring 
Your voice is soft like summer rain 
I cannot compete with you Jolene 

Now he talks about you in his sleep 
and there's nothing I can do to keep 
from crying when he calls your name Jolene 

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
I'm begging of you please don't take my man 
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Please don't take him just because you can 

Now I can easily understand 
How you could easily take my man 
But you don't know what he means to me Jolene 
Oh you could have your choice of men 
but I could never love again 
He's the only one for me Jolene 

Well I have to have this talk with you 
My happiness depends on you 
and whatever you decide to do Jolene 

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
I'm begging of you please don't take my man 
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Please don't take him just because you can
