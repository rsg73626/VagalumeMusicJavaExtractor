GET UP

Get up and come in
Get up and be all right
No more remains
And all that make you cry

Always…
Always sometime…

Love me! No matter how you feel
And someday you’ll stay all right

Get up and come in
Get up and be all right
Forgive me for something
Forgive me for one more time

Always…
Maybe sometime…

If you cry I can make the same
If you die I can be your grave
I have enough for you and I

Love me! No matter how you feel
And someday you’ll stay all right, stay all right
Just say that you’ll let me try, let me try…
