TERRORIZED

Take a place in the sky and watch
The whole world in ashes turning black
Now you can see your world is being terrorized
Can’t you hear the children crying
Or you prefer ignore then
And now you see your world is being terrorized



You are no longer blessed by your gods
Your badness who did cause that
And now you see your world is being terrorized
Now you can, let it all behind, your mistakes touching sky
No matter what you want, no matter where you go
Your live won’t turn back and your soul became so sad
Tomorrow will  you let me go?
Tomorrow will  you let me go?
Stay away, stay awhile

What do you wait in this 7 seconds
Running back into your live is up
And now you can see your world is being terrorized

Tell what is your last word
At your grave i will sing alone
And now you  see your world is being terrorized

Tomorrow will  you let me go?
Tomorrow will  you let me go?
Stay away, stay awhile
