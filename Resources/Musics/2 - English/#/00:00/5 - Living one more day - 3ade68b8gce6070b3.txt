LIVING ONE MORE DAY

I will live one more day, just to try to make you understand

I could live all my life and wont say a word
But I prefer to say the truth, crash and burn
So look inside the pyramids eyes
And we ll know all the secrets, conspiracy yeahh

You can believe that you are not alone
And our power can grow up more and more and more
Taking the test the thirteen families
And the all of the bloodline of tyranny

And I will live one more day
just to try to make you understand

But you need to know, how they are thinking
And you need to know
why they are killing, living, bleeding
Whats they meaning

I could live all my life and wont say a word
But I prefer to say the truth, crash and burn
So look inside the pyramids eyes
And we ll know all the secrets, conspiracy yeahh

You can believe that you are not alone
And our power can grow up more and more and more
Taking the test the thirteen families
And the all of the bloodline of tyranny

And I will live one more day
just to try to make you understand

But you need to know, how they are thinking
And you need to know
why they are killing, living, bleeding
Whats they meaning

Wake up or bleed it

(we ll see in the clouds the 98210
We ll see together the last rainbow, the last rainbow)
