DON´T LET YOUR HANDS DOWN

Don’t let your hands down

He Said you don’t have a good direction
You let the Wind flyaway
He Said you don’t fight for a reaction
And time is over for us

Maybe you don’t know but the concrete is broken
It comes down on your head
IF you stay in the way
Maybe you can see the fear on my face
Or do you need some glasses?
Are you ready for war?

Don’t let your hands down ( you wanna change this)
Wake up and show me ( oh yeah)
Don’t let your hands down ( make a prayer)
And fight for equality

Maybe you can see the fear on my face
Or do you need some glasses?
