WRONG SIDE OF THE MIRROR

I look into the mirror,
To see the reflection shatter.
To a life that has no meaning,
A day that just won’t go right.
Visions of you flash before my eyes.
Are you still here by my side?
I get caught in mental distress.
Why do these nightmares never end?
I’m stuck in a place that I’ll never leave.
I’m trapped within a fantasy.
A place filled with dark torment.
A world that was given to me,
I can no longer see the light,
Where did the day go?
Blackness surrounding me.
Wake me for I fear I’m dreaming.
A soul that forever has been lost,
I’ve noticed can never be found.
I’ve been lost for years.
When will I find my way?
I’m stuck within my past,
It keeps dragging me down.
I try to get away.
I’ve find there’s no way out.
I can no longer see the light,
Where did the day go?
Blackness surrounding me.
Wake me for I fear I’m dreaming.
I have been condemned.
All this life I’ve been denied,
Of all that is pure and true,
To stay on the wrong side of the mirror.
