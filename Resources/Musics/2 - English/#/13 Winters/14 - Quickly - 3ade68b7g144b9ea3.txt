QUICKLY

Pay, all by yourself
Never alone
Taking your place
You'd better make me see your pain
Never yourself
Suck by a loss
Taking your place
You'd better make me see you
Weren't you fucking listening to me

Stab me, shoot me
Take my life
Beat me, burn me
Kill me quickly

Keep, all by yourself
Crawling alone
Crawling away
You'd better savor your grace
Nothing you say
All by yourself
Straggling along
You'd better make me see you
Weren't you fucking listening to me

Stab me, shoot me
Take my life
Beat me, burn me
Kill me quickly

Save your silk cravat for another day
