COLD, DARK AND EMPTY

I've tried to love.
But it ends up breaking.
I've given my heart.
It's gotten stomped upon.
Crucify my emotions.
Doing it in front of everyone.
Tears may shed,
but inside i'm forever dead.

Cold, Dark, Empty.

You wonder why i am the way i am.
Maybe you are the one to make me this way.
You've tried to sleep into me.
Wondering if there's still love inside?

The day is done, and darkness falls,
As i walk into the night.
I know that i lost you, i know that it is over.
I know it's true, we're through.

Thinking i'm depressed.
I once was but no more!
No one to give me the attention I needed.
I gained a giant hole.
Sadness for months painted on my face.
I stay within complete silence.
Sharing nothing with no one.
Who wants to hear what i have to say?

Cold, Dark, Empty
