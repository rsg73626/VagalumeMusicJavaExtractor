BEYOND

You vanish into the darkness,
hoping you'll find your way.
The silence seeps deep within,
as the dark takes a hold of you.

You feel nothing inside but an
emptiness, you find is your only friend.
You decided to leave the misery behind,
take a chance in the dark beyond.

You've just pick up the pieces and DISAPPEAR,
the torture forever ate your soul.
You just want it all to fade away,
as you step into a world unknown.

Winds whisper within the dead trees,
leaves flow a upon the ground.
You wrap your arms to keep warm,
within you wonder is this depression?

LIFE JUST DIDN'T GIVE YOU A BREAK,
YOU GOT DAMNED WITH TORTURE AND PAIN.
IF SOMEONE SHOULD JOIN YOU ARE THEY LEAVING,
LEAVING THE SAME MISERY BEHIND?

The emptiness you feel will subside,
the one beside you, your only friend.
Both of you decided to leave the misery behind,
take a chance in the DARK BEYOND!
