FORSAKEN

Your god has forsaken me
So I remain in darkness
To hide my face away
To make myself no longer seen

My heart is always bleeding
For it's always breaking
You think a broken heart can mend
But it's been damaged for so long

You ask me why
God has turned his back on me
Blackness runs deep
Within these veins
Darkness plagues my heart and mind
Ask me if I need some sympathy

I walk within the dark forest
To call upon the Goddess
I look to the dark sky
To call upon the God

Your god may have cursed me
But it's a God I no longer believe
Nature has turned me
For there's no where else I'd like to be

My life is nothing but misery
Yet I find that it suits me
If you look with my twisted mind
Will you tell me what you find?

Your god has forsaken me
So I remain in the darkness
To hide my face away
To make myself no longer seen
