THE DEAD

Sadness plagues the heart
an emptiness that will never go away
You dwell within darkness
a place where you feel safe
Death comes without knowing
it attacks the heart deep inside
Tears fall just like rain
when will this pain subside?

Tomb Stones in ruin
silence fills the air
Saddend statues
seems like their watching you

Dead tree branches hang above your head
in a grave yard nothing but the dead
Autumn breeze fills out senses
within you feel like one of the dead

Can you relieve me of such dark thoughts
and you ease my twisted heart?
Deep within we're all morbid
take the time to realize it!

ONE OF THE DEAD!
