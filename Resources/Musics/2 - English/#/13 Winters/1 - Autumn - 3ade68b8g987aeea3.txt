AUTUMN

An emptiness seems to fade as I walk in the fog.
I hunger for the darkness, my only will in life.
Wind blows leaves on the ground,
Autumn surrounds me with it's beauty.
I gather myself where I'm not found,
to gaze into the midnight sky.

I try for once to forget everything in my life.
To be at ease with with my tortured mind.
To hide my sorrow that grows inside.
To be by myself, DEAD TO THE WORLD!

I've hated myself for a long,
I need to let the pain out.
Make my mind subside in the light of the Full Moon.

Burning leaves fill the cold air, wrap myself into me.
I want the night to set my heart free.
Will this night comfort me?

Tears fall down my face,
for something can't be placed.
A hold that can;t be filled,
a giant hole inside me.

Will this Autumn night set me free,
to embrace me with it's beauty?
To comfort me with its full glory?
In this season I feel no misery.
