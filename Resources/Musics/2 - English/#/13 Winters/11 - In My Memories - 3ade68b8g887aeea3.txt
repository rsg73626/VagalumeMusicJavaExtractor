IN MY MEMORIES

Darkness silence us without words,
Emptiness is a comfort I can no longer afford.
Loneliness comes to us when we need it most,
Yet I hate every moment of it.

Rain falls as tears run down my face.
Just know you'll be missed and never replaced.
You remain in my memories and in my heart.
Why did they take your life away?

Every morning I wake I feel nothing.
Every night I sleep I have hurt inside.
Yet nothing I do can make it go away.
Sorrow haunts me deep within my soul.

You try to pick up the pieces and move,
When it's someone close to you it's hard.
I think of you in my dreams every night.
I place a rose on your grave when I can.
