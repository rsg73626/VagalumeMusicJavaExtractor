BEAUTY IS THE BEAST

beauty and beastTale as old as time, 
true as it can be. 
Barely even friends, 
then somebody bends unexpectedly. 
Just a little change. 
Small to say the least. 
Both a little scared, 
neither one prepared. 
Beauty and the Beast. 
Ever just the same. 
Ever a surprise 
Ever as before, 
and ever just as sure 
as the sun will rise. 
Whoa,- oh,- oh,- oh.- oo-oo-o-o-oo 
Ever just the same. 
Ever a surprise. 
Ever as before, 
and ever just as sure 
as the sun will rise. 
Oh, oh, oh, 
Tale as old as time 
tune as old as song 
Bitter sweet and strange, 
finding you can change, 
learning you were wrong. 
Certain as the sun. 
Certain as the sun. 
rising in the East. 
Tale as old as time, 
song as old as rhyme. 
Beauty and the Beast. 
Tale as old as time, 
song as old as rhyme 
Beauty and the Beast. 
Beauty and the Beast. 
Beauty and the Beast.
