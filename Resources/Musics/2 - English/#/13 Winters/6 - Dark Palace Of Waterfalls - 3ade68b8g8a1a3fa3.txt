DARK PALACE OF WATERFALLS

A love that could not be saved.
Ended in a tragic way.
All because of what you done.
Look around it’s your kingdom come.
A telltale heart you broke.
Their tears becoming a mote.
Haunted by your carnal sin.
You have the key let yourself in.

The Dark Palace Of Waterfalls.
Oceans of tears flood it’s halls.
The chandelliers are made of rain.
A dower of remorse for you to gain.

There’s nothing you could do,
To bring my love back to you.
Your heart was just too cruel.

As you sit on your chair and cry.
Your startled by the thunder.
All dressed up but no man will show.
Your gown soaked it pulls you under.
Playing the part of Guinevere,
You thought you could have it all.
But with the secrets you kept you were doomed to fall.
The men you held tight,
One in your heart the other in bed.
The kisses you stole,
The double life you lead.

Drowning in a valley of despair.
Scorned by those painful years.
I want so much to make amends.
Find myself prisoner of my fears.

On your head sits a crown on wet hair.
A throne of cold stone washed bare.
Like the love he once held for you.
But you couldn’t keep your vow true.
Meaningless was very word your troth.
Trapped now, your heart to this abode.
Made your own personal hell.
When your tears had shed and fell.
