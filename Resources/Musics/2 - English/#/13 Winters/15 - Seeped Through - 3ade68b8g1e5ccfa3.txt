SEEPED THROUGH

Wandering the night,
To please the appetite.
Gaze into the midnight sky.
One last kiss before you close your eyes. 

(Solo - Martin) 

A glance into the mirror,
Seeing that I bare the mark.
Going into a state of shock,
Nothing seems to be getting clearer.
The blood has soaked through,
Every broken pore.
A nightmare coming true.
Your mark becoming sore. 

Eye sight is getting sharper.
Hearing things never heard before.
Every night you become the stalker,
Not knowing what’s in store.
When you close your eyes to sleep,
Don’t know what you’ll eat.
Eventually it seems to hit you.
You’re becoming something else. 

Chorus:
Night after night it’s the same.
Becoming what you’ll forever despise.
A nightmare coming true.
Your mark is impure and seeped through. 

Wanting to end your life,
Knowing you don’t have it in you.
Howling at the darkened sky,
A creature transformed. 

Chorus:
Night after night it’s the same.
Becoming what you’ll forever despise.
A nightmare coming true.
Your mark is impure and seeped through. 

Wanting to end your life,
Knowing you don’t have it in you.
Howling at the darkened sky,
A creature transformed.
