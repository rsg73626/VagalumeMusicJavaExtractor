COMMON FIST

The time has come.
Just like the old days you shut me out.
I feel forever unknown.
Something so miniscule,
Has become even smaller.
But it's just a facade that I wear.
This time will be hte last time it slides!

All the times I cried.
The times I tried to escape.
It all gets left behind for a new start!
