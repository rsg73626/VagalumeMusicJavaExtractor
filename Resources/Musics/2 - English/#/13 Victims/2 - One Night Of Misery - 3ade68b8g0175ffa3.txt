ONE NIGHT OF MISERY

Always starting things!
Always causing trouble.
Get out of my life in the double!
Always making promises you'll never make.
Ruining innocent lifes,changing them in an instant.
I won't back down, I won't give up!

You have no reason to hit me.
All I see is evil in your eyes.
Your world is fake!

Currupt in the mind you are.
You have no reason to yell
