NEVER SURRENDER (NO DESIT VIRTUS)

Victory is for those who are willing to kill or die.
We stand side by side, we never questioned why.
My brothers aren't afraid.
I trust my life in their hands.
They'll fight by my side until the bloody end.
Do you know what it means, have you ever sacrificed?
Pride. Honor. Loyalty.
Make the deal, pay the price.
We all walk the line, win or lose.
Do or die.
If you can't share my pain, how can you share my life?
Life among the thugs and drugs, their fucking fisticuffs.
This is how I live my life, and I can't get enough.
My Life. My Crew.
FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!
