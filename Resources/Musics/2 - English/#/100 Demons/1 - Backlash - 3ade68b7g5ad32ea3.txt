BACKLASH

mesmorized by your beauty i feel powerless in your gaze
ostracized, treated unfairly at night i dream of blood filled days
because in this world
no one has your back
a lifetime of devotion
all i feel is had
what's the price of freedom what's the price of integrity
should i suffer for your sins and live this life of agony
because in this world
a lifetime is devotion
and all i feel is had
a generation of apathy with folk heros from infamy
empty lives now have direction
just one bullet changed perception
kicked and beaten for so long pushed around
and told i'm wrong
with you in my sights i'm free no longer fear
but strength you see
