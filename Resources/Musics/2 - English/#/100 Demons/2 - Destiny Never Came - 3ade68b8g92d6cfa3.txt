DESTINY NEVER CAME

I wasn't meant to be, no one sent for me.
Always told I was something more.
This destiny will destroy me.
Been rotting to the core.
Never once did I care of the plans that were made.
Never once did I cry at the end, or at my grave.
They pushed and pushed till I would bleed.
Not even once did I agree to all the shit they fed me.
Could never make a man succeed.
And I screamed, and I did shout.
They chewed me up and spit me out.
But here I stand with broken hands.
Pounding on the walls of fucking destiny.
Fuck your destiny.
Fuck your golden child.
Fuck your women and children.
Fuck you and die.
Fuck your plans for me.
Oh can't you see I never wanted a part of this shit that you have planned for me.
Destiny never came.
