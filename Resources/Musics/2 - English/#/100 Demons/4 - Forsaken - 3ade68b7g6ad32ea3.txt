FORSAKEN

you know who i love - nobody
you know who i trust - nobody
you know who i fear - nobody
i prayed a thousand times
he never answered me
do you think i've sinned
in the eyes of the lord
he never did shit for me
i stand alone in this world
trust and faith
so long forgotten
you and i
we are forsaken
just fucking kill me

put me out of this pain
