TIME BOMB

Don't even tell me because I already know.
This fucking beast inside always ready to make a show.
Never can I leave it behind, a definite part of me.
It has controlled my life, it is destroying me.
I don't need the drugs, because the rage, it gets me high.
I didn't say I won't do them though, that would be a lie.
Crashing inside my head the red it clouds my eyes.
I always ruin what I value the most.
Existing in hell, this is all that I know.
Where the comfort lies YOU MADE ME!!!
You can't help me.
God help you.
You can't help me.
God help!
