DYING IN MY OWN ARMS

What makes you think that your death is secure?
That you won't die alone.
Your solace isn't something to seek.
It's a sign of the weak.
Who will save your rotten soul?
In time all memories will fold.
ace down with your head in your hands.
You'll be dying in your own arms.
BROKE DOWN!!!
Left a wreck.
BURNT OUT!!!
A husk of a man.
WASTED!!!
But not nearly so close.
I'm dying in my own arms.
Do you think you have someone?
You will die alone.
Die alone motherfucker.
I am dying in my own arms.
