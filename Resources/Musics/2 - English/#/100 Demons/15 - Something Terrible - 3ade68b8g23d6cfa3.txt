SOMETHING TERRIBLE

I've found tricks.
That I use when I know that I've been beat.
I climb so fucking deep inside of me.
I've said it once and I'll scream it again.
Sometimes hatred is my only friend.
Something terrible has crossed my mind.
Fucking miserable all the time.
Something terrible, it's in my head.
It's killing...it's killing me.
I was born with this fault they call rage.
I never asked for this pain, it just came.
All the times that I hurt my family and myself and my loves.
Something terrible has crossed my mind.
Fucking miserable all the time.
Something terrible, it's in my head.
It's killing...it's killing me.
I was born with this fault they call rage.
I never asked for this pain, it just came.
All the times that I hurt my family and myself and my loves.
