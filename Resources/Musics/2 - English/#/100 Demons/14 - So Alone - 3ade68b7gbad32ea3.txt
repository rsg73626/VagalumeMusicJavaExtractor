SO ALONE

can't live without you you're my saving grace
you helped me keep my sanity
when i was struggling you were by my side
you helped me face reality
the lust i had for you nearly drove me insane
i managed to walk away but doubt i'll ever be the same
you are my one true love for now and forever
and when i have you in my arms can't feel the pain i'm still bitter
i feel so alone - you've sucked the life out of me
i'm already dead i just don't know it yet
because you stole my heart a love i can't forget
slowly dying when will i go
i wish i was dead i feel so alone
your just a memory a twist of fate from god above
when i lie awake at night it's you i crave - it's you i love
the pain it burns inside i suffer everyday
still alive wishing i was dead like christ at the stake
