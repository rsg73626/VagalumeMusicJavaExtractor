CAN WE TALK

last night I
I saw you standing
and i started,started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too
And just like a roni
You were too shy
But you weren't the only'cause so was I
And i've dreamed of you ever since
Now i've built up my confidence
Girl next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say
(Can we talk for a minute
Girl i want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl i want to know your name)
I started to write you letters
But i wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk to you
But just like a baby
I could not talk
I tried to come closer
But could not walk
And i think of it every night
How i just could not get it right
If we ever come close again
I know what i'll say then
(HOOK)
Oh girl, one more chance
With you again
I will not let it go
Oh please, give me just one more chance for love (HOOK)
