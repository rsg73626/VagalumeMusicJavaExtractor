FIRE

( Jimi Hendrix )
You don't care for me,
I don't care about that
Got a new fool, ha, I'd like to laugh at
I have only one burning desire,
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire ....
You say your mom ????,
...
And you won't get burned, I have only one itchin' desire,
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire ....
You try to give me your money,
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burnin' desire,
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire ....
