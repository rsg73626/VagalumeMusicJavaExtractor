ONE MAN'S LEFTOVERS (IS ANOTHER MAN'S FEAST)

Yum yum yummy
Got love for my tummy
Yum yum yummy
Got love from your honey

[CHORUS]
One man's leftovers
Is another man's feast
One man's leftovers
Is another man's feast

Like a one-eyed hungry cat
I watched your woman each day
Hoping you'd be fed up
And throw her love away

You found you someone else
And now I'm helping myself
Having myself a picnic
Loving the love you left

[Repeat CHORUS]

She sent her love to you
On a silver tray
You messed over her mind
And threw her love away

When she's in my arms
My appetite's fulfilled
She brings her love to me
Like a full course meal

[Repeat CHORUS]

Yum yum yummy
Got love for my tummy
Yum yum yummy
Got love from your honey

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm feasting on the love
You let go to waste, oh
Having myself a picnic
Loving here in your place

[Repeat CHORUS]
