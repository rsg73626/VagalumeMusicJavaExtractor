BREAK UP LETTER

If I told you one day,
That I would never hurt you.
That I would be a promise I can't make
If I told you someday, 
That this could be true love forever.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.

If I made you cry 1000 times
would you still take me back
and I miss you
and I swore to God I would never miss you
if I told you I'm ok
and all my friends are doing great without you here
this letters so impersonal she said

the words just seem to pour right off the page

this is your break up letter
I lied when I told you it's not you that it's me
this is your break up letter
I'll set you on fire just to see the colors you could make

If I left you here for six long years
your washed up you feel used
are you jaded
and I pray to God you don't hate me
if I say I'll be home soon
a broken heart and an empty room is all you'll find
with a letter in the middle of the floor

the words just seem to fall right off the page
I try to scream but somehow I can't breathe

this is your break up letter
I lied when I told you it's not you that it's me
this is your break up letter
I'll set you on fire just to see the colors you could make

So tell me
so tell me what you're thinking
cause I can't read your mind
so tell me
so tell me what you're thinking
it's hard to see things clear
behind your blackened eyes

and I could make things right
if all the stars aligned
a different place a different time
cross my heart and hope you die

the words just seem to fall right off the page
I try to scream but somewhere I can't breathe
I know I made my share of mistakes
but you were the worst one
the worst mistake I ever made
