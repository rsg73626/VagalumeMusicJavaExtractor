NIGHT TO REMEMBER

This could be a night to remember, but you still give me nightmares Ill never forget.
Im sleeping with the lights on tonight so before you go, 
Ill tell you what Im thinking. 

Do you really want a one night romance.
Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance.
Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending now. 

Im anticipating, all these phone calls youre desperately making. 
Im dying from the sound of your voice. 
Before you go, try to stop the bleeding. 
Ill leave the lights on so you can find your way back home.
When you get here all of these doors they will be locked closed.

Do you really want a one night romance?
Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance?
Do you really want a storybook ending? Move on lets stop pretending!
Do you really want a one night romance?
Do you really want a starlight slow dance?
Do you really want a storybook ending? move on lets stop pretending!

You always ask me where we went wrong.
It must have been the day that I wrote this song. 
Get up and get out, I think its over. Get up and get out, I think its over. 
Get up and get out, I think its over. Life is full of regrets put on your shoulders. Theres a whisper in your left ear loud and clear. 
A casual conversation. Let me know, are you dialing the phone.
Do you really want a one night romance. 
Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance.

Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending.
Do you really want a one night romance.
Do you really want a starlight slow dance. 
Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending.

I need you like a hole in the head And Im thinking that Im better off dead than spending one more night with you.
