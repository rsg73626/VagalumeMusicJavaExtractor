PACK IT UP

Pack it up we can leave this city behind.
So long, so long, I wish you well.
Pack it up. We can leave this hell behind. So long, so long, I wish you well.

In the scheme of things I've found these kind of nights so meaningful yet dissapointing, but I still make myself go.
I know it's kind of shitty that I'm leaving a note, but this city just wasn't that great.
I'm losing handle on the end of the rope and this cities tied up and the knotting is getting so frayed.

Pack it up we can leave this city behind.
So long, so long, I wish you well.
Pack it up. We can leave this hell behind. So long, so long, I wish you well.

In the seam of things i found what ties us up can be so easily disjointed, I'm losing my sense of control.
The weather's kind of shitty so we'll head to the coast and drive till this engine breaks down.
A thousand miles on the heels of a ghost with the memories of home, ringing out so loud.

Pack it up we can leave this city behind. So long, so long, I wish you well.
Pack it up. We can leave this hell behind. So long, so long, I wish you well.

you said you buried your heart in this town. Just wait till you dig it up
