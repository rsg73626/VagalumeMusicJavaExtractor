PHONEBOOKS DON'T LEAVE BRUISES

If I had known all these roads had led to you
I would of crashed this car
now I'm leaving you with all this sorrow
and send me your very best
the world does not revolve around your heart

you said that you would die for me
I know it's hard but try the best you can

I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night

you said you lie awake
and cry yourself to sleep
while lying in my bed
so I'm asking one question and I'll try to make it brief
do you care if I'm alive or you're dead

you said you would die for me
just wait a while I'm sure you'll get your chance

I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night

the wait is over,
say good bye to what you had
and I'll miss you
it's all those quiet things that no one talks about
it's over, it's over
it's so over

always and forever, I'll miss you more than ever

I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night
