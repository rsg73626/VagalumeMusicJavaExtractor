RISE TO FIND

Casting away 
the silent drum for marching 
to the journeys end 
is it here you shall stay 
if only you knew the way 
if the day 
arrives to find you dreaming 
of a distant place 
will it turn away 
if only you could be sure 
if you have all you came for 
iwll you stay 
or rise to find the same game 
will you play 
you turn to question 
your reaction will display 

Lightly you tread 
upon the branch, will it give way 
or hold you high 
for all you know 
its only you who can say 
feel the glow 
of endless minds sleeping 
and now they are dreaming 
of a distant place still unknown 
if you have all you came for 
will you stay 
or rise to find the same game 
will you play 
you turn to question 
your reaction will display
