FURTHER AWAY

I have felt silence 
though distractions are in the way 
will my memory bind me 
to all the beauty I have known 
my favourite questions 
are the ones I cant resolve 
can I choose to remember 
or will the days slip away 

Further away, further away 
I hope this one will stay 

I know I cant measuer 
all that I see 
each moment will pass by 
so the next can have its day 
this strange equation 
brings a smile to my face 
can I choose to remember 
or will the days slip away 

Further away, further away 
I hope this one will stay
