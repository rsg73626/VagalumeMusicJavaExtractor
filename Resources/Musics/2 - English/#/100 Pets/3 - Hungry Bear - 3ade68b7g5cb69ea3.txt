HUNGRY BEAR

Weary eyed people spy 
have you got my number 
dancing through the turnstile 
can you catch me with your silver tongue 
forever divide, collect and find 
the changing light has you 
in its sight from where you are 
its only time that you fear 

Twist around the new one found 
you feel like a hungry bear 
every day actions sway 
could you simplify if you tried 
forever divide, collect and find 
the changing light has you 
in its sight from where you are 
its only time that you fear
