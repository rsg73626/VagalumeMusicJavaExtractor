MOUNTAIN CHEER

Oh kindly one 
you glitter like mountain cheer 
through the cold nights numbing efar 
can you still closer still 
I feel you are true 
I trust you through and through 
circling around 
your goodwill surrounds 
I do not feel out of place, out of phrase 
I wont look away anymore 
my kindly one 
oh how you shine
