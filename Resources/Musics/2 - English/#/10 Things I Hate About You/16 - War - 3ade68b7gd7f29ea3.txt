WAR

Oh, come crush me now 
Don't leave 
No one has won this war 
This time 

No, don't sleep tonight 
I'm hurt and ready for fire 
Don't leave me up 
Alarmed and ready to die 

Come on, it's war, come on 
Come on, come on, come on 
Come on, it's war, come on 

Please, I'm almost done 
Don't you treat 
I've loaded my gun 
With love, with... 
Hear the dust roll over the floor 
Why must you sleep? 
Come crush me now 
I'm armed 
And ready to die 

Come on, it's war, come on 
Come on, come on, come on 
Come on, it's war, come on 

And if you're peaceful when you sleep 
Give the facile 
It's such an easy way to choose 
You loose 

Come on, it's war, come on 
Come crush me now 
Come on, come on, come on 
Come on, it's war, come on 
Come crush me now 
Come on, come on, come on 
Come on, fight me, come on 

And if you're peaceful when you sleep 
Give the facile 
It's such an easy way to choose 
You loose
