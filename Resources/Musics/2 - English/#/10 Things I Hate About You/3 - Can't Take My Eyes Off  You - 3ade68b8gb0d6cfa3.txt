CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF  YOU

You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you
