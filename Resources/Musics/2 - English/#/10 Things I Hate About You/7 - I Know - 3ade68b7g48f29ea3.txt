I KNOW

My mama said to stay away from guys like you. 
She said they were nasty make me do things I don't wanna do 
Stay away from bad boys they've got one thing on their mind 
Their hormones are raging and they want it all the time 

CHORUS: And I know, know cuz she said so 
And I can't just let you go 
And I know, know cuz she said so 
And I can't just let you go 

I love you very much, you're nice to see and nice to touch 
And I'll never ever ever treat you wrong, 
I've been waiting for you all along. 

REPEAT CHORUS 

Never let go. Never let go. I said I want you to know. 
I said I want you to know right now. I want you to know 
I said I want you to know
