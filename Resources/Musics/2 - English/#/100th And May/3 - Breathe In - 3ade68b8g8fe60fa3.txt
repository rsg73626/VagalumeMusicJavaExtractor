BREATHE IN

So you take in everything you can
Just to make sure youre alright
And the voices from within
Begin to take flight
So you feel free, you feel everything
Just to feel alive
And youre dancing round and round
Just to feel this life
Now youre everything, everything right
But you dont feel alive
If your life is worth living, we all can try
To be alive
Amen
Time is of the essence, we cant learn to rhyme
But will millions of pages of all of lifes phrases, love, we can try
The voices around you, they claim to hold the truth, they cant save you
Just listen with eyes closed, feel what you know is life
Now I see the truth 
Its what binds me and you
And everyone swears that their real
Everyone swears they can feel
Well show me someone that loves this life
