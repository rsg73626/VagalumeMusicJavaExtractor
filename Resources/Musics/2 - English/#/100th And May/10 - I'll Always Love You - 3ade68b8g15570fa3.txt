I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU

It all starts when you give that smile to me
And I feel my heart beating faster
Its those times when shes laying on your shoulder
And all you can do is laugh
Its that way she smiles when you mess up
You can always count on her to make you laugh
And its her touch when her hand graces your arm
And it feels like everythings ok
I can count on you to be there
Holding my hand till the end
No matter what they say or might do
Ill always love you
Its the way you look into her eyes
Love, your beautiful eyes get to me
Its the song that you sing over and over
Just to make sure that in the end itll all turn out alright
And I promise that Ill be the best that I can be
Cause you gave that much to me
