A REAL BOY

Am I holding back feelings that I show
I guess Im just scared to tell you what I know
Girl youve got me wrapped all around your words
So please speak up now, man if you only knew herwhen you wish upon a star it makes no difference who you are

Anything your heart desires I will give to you
Is it just me or are you everything Ive dreamed?
I can read your eyes like a childhood book
And I become real and I know I should
Though my words are frail would you be mine tonight?
