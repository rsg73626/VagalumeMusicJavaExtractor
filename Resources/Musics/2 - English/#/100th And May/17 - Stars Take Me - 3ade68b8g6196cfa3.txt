STARS TAKE ME

All my sunny days all my happy waves come from you you know
your eyes help brighten my skies when Im down if I give or take could I make you mine cause theres no one else with your sweet smile I confess

Stars take me tonight to where ever she is and dont you let her cry she means more to me than you could ever imagine, she what they call a dream

youre my sunshine
youre my everything yes you are everything I have
everything I am longs for you dont mind if I cry if you walk away tonight cause theres no one else that Id rather swing with than you into the sunshine
