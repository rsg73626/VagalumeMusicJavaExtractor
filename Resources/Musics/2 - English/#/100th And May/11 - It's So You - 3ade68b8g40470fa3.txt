IT'S SO YOU

Here we go just me and you
We can make this last forever
Get in the car and well drive to LA
Listen now, youve gone too far
And time is running out
Were in it for love or not in it at all
Man this life is so messed up 
We need a TV show for this
Call it quits or call it anything
As long as everythings ok
Until you come home, I will sit here
Thinking about you in every way
The night is so brilliant, its so perfect
Its so you
Aint this great, I fell for you
And you made this all ok
Forgive me if I crack a smile
Cause I love your hair in your face
When youre mad and I know its cause I 
Took a big chance and now youre mine
May I just say that you are so wonderful?
May I just say you are so beautiful?
You say everythings alright
I dont believe in fairy tales
Well I guess I can try
