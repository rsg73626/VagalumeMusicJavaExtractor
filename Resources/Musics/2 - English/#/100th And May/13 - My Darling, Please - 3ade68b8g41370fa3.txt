MY DARLING, PLEASE

I never said you had to leave
Never said Goodbye
But you walked out the door
The tire tracks on the road
Told me what Ive always known
Youre always going to be somewhere else
Youre always in my heart
Youll always be there
Youre always in my heart
Please just leave it there..
Im always gonna be here
Always gonna stay
Right here for you
And Ill find a way to bring you back to my arms
Now Im finally down on my knees
Theres too many hours in too many days
Nobody seems to get the chance to say
What they feel inside
