DANCING FOR DREAMS

Im not ashamed of 
Anything that youve ever done 
In fact I realize 
That its me youve been running from 
The voices, the choices 
Everything Ive done to keep you here 
Is worthless, I know this 
That letting go is your greatest fear 
And you are safer 
When I awake from my sleep 
Im finally dancing for dreams 
And now that you are free do 
Do you cry to sleep at night 
I wont be there to wipe your eyes 
To think I could stop time 
Id do better to out shine the stars 
Cause one day youll need me 
But I wont be right there where you are 
I wonder if its her 
That keeps this fairy tale alive 
Cause sometimes later at night 
I feel the tear that comes from her eyes 
I wont run away no I wont run away from you 
Ill find a way, I will find a way to you
