WHEN I SEE YOU (THE BRANDON DAY SONG)

Theres no other way to say this 
Love, Ive got to sing it 
Gotta keep my head above the mountains 
That Ive climbed to be with you 
We were caught in something 
I didnt let go 
I told myself youd be back soon 
I really hope I was right 
Honestly, Im tired of commin in last place 
Honestly, I honestly 
Knew that I was wrong 
Knew that I would fall 
Knew that Id give everything I had 
Just to see you smile 
Tried to be perfect 
Tried to let you let 
Trying be as simple as the words 
That come from my heart 
You took me by surprise 
When I first saw you 
The sunlight in your hair 
O, that long black hair in your face 
I was nervous when you 
Sat right down beside me 
A firework display was nothing 
Compared to your eyes that nite 
Honestly, Im tired of commin in last place 
Honestly, I honestly 
Knew that I was wrong 
Knew that I would fall 
Knew that Id give everything I had 
Just to see you smile 
Tried to be perfect 
Tried to let you let 
Trying be as simple as the words 
That come from my heart 
And I would do it again 
Just to relive those seconds 
Even fireworks couldnt compare to you, my dear 
Nor the stars that they shinned with 
Its a memory 
That I hope to see again 
To see you smile one more time 
To see your face shine like the stars 
I knew that I was wrong 
Knew that I would fall 
But it didnt matter, cause I was with you 
And you were with me 
You were so perfect 
You were the one who let 
This heart come back alive 
With the way that I felt inside 
I dont care if I am wrong 
Dont care if I will fall 
All that matters is that you could see 
What you do to me 
When I see you 
When I see you
