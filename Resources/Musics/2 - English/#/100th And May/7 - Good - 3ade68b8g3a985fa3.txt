GOOD

It almost kills me to realize that 
I almost held you tight 
You said New Orleans is where Im goin 
And its just about time 
Ill leave the faces, all the lonely places 
Ill leave it all behind 
I just shrug my shoulders, cause its gettin colder 
In Mississippi tonight 
No one understands what it feels like 
To touch an angels hand 
I hope your tears dont cry out the window 
And dont look back, my love 
They say everybody has somebody 
They can grow old with 
Well if thats true, then why is she leaving? 
Why is she leaving rain clouds on my heart? 
Im on my bed now, thinking about 
You and everything I said 
Dont leave me here 
Dont say Goodbye 
Cause youre in my heart 
Where youll always stay 
Where youll always stay, hey, hey 
Come back to me 
I am tired and I am broken 
But Im willing to wait for you 
Heres my last chance to let you know that 
I love you and do you love me? 
That summer was the greatest ever 
I wished it never would have ended 
When I looked at you and you looked at me 
Just for once, Id like to know what it means to be free 
You said New Orleans is where youre going 
And its just about time 
I never told you, but I will now 
I think I love you
