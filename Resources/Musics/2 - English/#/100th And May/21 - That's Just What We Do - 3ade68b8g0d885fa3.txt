THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DO

Youve been everything that Ive dreamed 
And wished for in this lifetime 
With an angels smile and long blonde hair 
I thought I knew this 
Id given anything to become the boy 
Youd always dreamed of 
By the way I act I think that I 
Know what Im after 

-Chorus- 
But I think I love you 
I think weve become one 
Theres no use fighting 
Wed be denying what we know is true 
Cause thats just what we do 

 
I have lived a life thats all tied up 
And I, Im ready for you 
To take this life and make it right 
So I, I can love you 
Did you know I wrote this for you 
Before you even knew me 

-Bridge- 
Were breaking free tonite 
Letting go of our goodbyeswoa 
Everything weve felt it known 
Youre somebody Id love to know
