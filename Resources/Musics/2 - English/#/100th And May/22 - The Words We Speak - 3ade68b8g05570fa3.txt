THE WORDS WE SPEAK

It seems so hard to say
What I feel and what I do
But Im doing everything for you
Dont shut your eyes my dear
The past is all that you should fear
Cause everything is well behind you
And thats ok
Yea thats ok
Tonight is out last night
The fireflies match your eyes
I wish I could catch them with a jar
So heres to our last kiss
Im so nervous I just might miss
So Ill close my eyes and count to 10
And thats ok
Yea thats ok
Please tell me now what I 
Cant let you go this summer night
Its a question we resort to all the time
And everybody knows
Im such a fool, I dont know why
Why I let you change my life
Yea, thats ok
Ok, Ive had enough of you
