TO:THE LOVE OF MY LIFE

Everyone has got something to show 
for me its this reflection 
promising itll find someone someday
and it seems like the whole world finally has sound 
telling me youre worth it 
and I think that youre worth it too my dear
So Ill stand back for now
and admire you from afar
cause no one else has ever made me feel this way 
and I wont hold your hand 
cause Ill never want to let go 
its a test of will that I am willing to take 
As priceless as the voice inside your eyes 
I give all I have to
show that I am still here 
and I dream about meeting you someday 
when I do I swear to you I will 
hold you tight and never let you go
So Ill stand back for now
and admire you from afar
cause no one else has ever made me feel this way 
and to the love of my life
heres my only prayer
that youll Christ more than you love this life
Cause thats where Ill find you
And I feel these chains finally broken
When I see your face staring right back at me
Its a chance that Ill take, yea I will
Just to show you that I really care
Girl I do, I swear that I care
And Ill stand back for now 
To admire you from afar
Just to show you that no one else has ever made me feel this way
And if you hold out your hand
Let it be to show me
That you were willing to wait till this day
To the love of my life
Youre my only prayer
Cause you loved Christ more than this life
