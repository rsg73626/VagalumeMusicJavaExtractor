HER WISH

She said I want someone to hold my hand 
In the mall, just to make the other girls jealous 
Someone to sing to me 
And someone whos more romantic than goofy 
Someone to throw stuffed animals at me 
When Im acting dumb 
And a guy who would make fun of me 
Just to hear me laugh 

-Chorus- 
Well I cant buy you a diamond 
Or a fancy life 
But I could bet you all my kisses 
Just to make you laugh 
 
She wants someone to play with her hair 
And buy her a 25 cent ring 
Someone who would share a lollipop 
And count the stars just before it rains 
Maybe someone who would fill their camera 
Of pictures of her and their love 
Someone who would always make her smile 
That's someone she would love
