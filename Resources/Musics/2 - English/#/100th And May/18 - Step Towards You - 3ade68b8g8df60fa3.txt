STEP TOWARDS YOU

When you come around
You make me feel so proud 
Isnt it common sense
When you feel like this
I would dance with you
Even if there was no song
We could get caught if we want
But playing games is just more fun

So I will
I will step towards you tonight
And I will
I will look into your eyes
Just to find out if theres life still left in this heart
Yea it beats but I just think that its not
Too many times have I failed to win
Just to prove I know where to begin
And you swear youre coming back around

She thinks that in the end
Shell become what shes not
And I cant help but laugh
Cause I know where she is and where Im at
