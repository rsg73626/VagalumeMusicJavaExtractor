GO DOWN IN A FIGHT

Close your eyes, hold on tight 
You're gonna make it 
Rewind back to when you were young 
Can you remember? 
Trace back the innoncence that was lost 
But can you find it? 
-Chorus- 
Go down swinging, go down in a fight 

Tell me true, tell me that, that you love him 
Honestly, does he let you understand 
That you can make it 
Just take my hand 
-Repeat Chorus X3- 
-Bridge- 
And i'm not trying to write fairy tales 
Cause girl you know their all lies 
He says "you're great", that's wonderful 
But can you see past his disguise...

You're an angel that's fallen from the stars 
And they all want you...just look at your scars 
 
I swear you'll make, I swear you will 
Give 'em hell kid, I'll be right there for you 
It's alright, it'll be ok if you cry on my shoulder 
Just let your tears fall on me 
And realize, that all that glitters was never gold 
It was your eyes 
 
Now the crowd is wathin, watchin for you to fall 
Give 'em hell kid, do it for us all 
I told you once, i told you twice 
Make a mistake and it'll cost a life...
