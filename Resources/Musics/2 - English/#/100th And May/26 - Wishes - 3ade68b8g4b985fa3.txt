WISHES

Look inside the mirror and tell me what you see 
Is it a lost or broken memory? 
And I cant try to find a reason why 
You find yourself in my arms tonight 
Ive tried and tried until I fell down 
The reasons why you cannot feel the ground 

-Chorus- 
Cause youre an angel, youre feel cant touch the ground 
And the places that you lost were never found 
Its an unknown reason I cant explain why 
Cause I just make wishes when I look in your eyes 

 
Falling down is only halfway up 
When youve fallen for the most beautiful girl 
And she reads to me the stories of her life 
When shes lying in my arms 
She says Evan, why cant I hear the sounds
