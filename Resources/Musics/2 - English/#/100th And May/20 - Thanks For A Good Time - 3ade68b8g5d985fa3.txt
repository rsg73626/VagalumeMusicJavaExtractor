THANKS FOR A GOOD TIME

Im sorry for the day 
That I saw your face 
I tried to help myself, but I couldnt look away 
Im sorry for the words 
That I said to you 
I couldnt help but tell you every word was true 
I guess I got caught up 
In what I thought could be 
The greatest part of life, the greatest part of me 
I wonder if you knew 
What I was thinkin when 
You said to me that night Thanks for a good time 
I guess I was just fooling myself 
Cause how could I ever be with you 
I guess my heart will rest here in last place 
Its something Ive come used to 
She cant help but feel 
The lies that shes been told 
Hell just run away, and youll grow only cold 
I swear to you that I 
Will never leave your side 
Ill always stand up tall; Ill always be your all 
As night begins to break 
I cannot help but say 
Why does this always happen to me? 
I thought somehow shed be 
With someone like me 
But then I remembered, I get caught up in dreams 
I guess I was just fooling myself 
Cause how could I ever be with you 
I guess my heart will rest here in last place 
Katelyn, its something Ive come used to
