WHO I AM

You said you would dance around 
If there was sound 
You said you would paint my heart 
Back into placeagain 
I said you were everything 
Anyone could ever dream 
You said I was kindly blind 
No one wants me 
One look in your eyes and I was blinded 
One touch of your hands and I was moved 
One scent of the fragrance that surrounded you 
And the truth of it all is that you saved me 
You asked me why tonight? 
Why someone like me? 
Ill tell you the same thing 
I said to you that night 
Its because for once in my life 
I did something right 
It felt like we stood there for hours 
Just starin into the sky 
But the true display was right beside 
When I saw the work of God in your eyes 
O yea 
I saw that work of God in your eyes 
And I was so astounded 
Cause you didnt even know 
The air was filled with laughter, with love 
And your eyes 
One look in your eyes and I was blinded 
One touch of your hands and I was moved 
One scent of the fragrance that surrounded you 
And the truth of it all is that you loved me
