NOT GOIN' BACK

Tell me what you know and Ill spill my guts
About everything
Where were you when I felt like falling
Out in the rain?
Im not goin back
Again
Sometimes love I feel you with me
When its cold outside
You always loved the winter weather
You said itd never die
The leaves in the air matched the sky
I know because I was there
No one else could tell the wind
What it meant to you
Sometimes I wonder why
Why the snow fell down
It was questions wed figure out
Soon but not right now
I felt a pulling on my heart
But I told it to go
But it was you all along
You taught me what I know
