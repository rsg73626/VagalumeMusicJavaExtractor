MY BEST FRIEND

Im getting better better than this world better than this 
life 
I fear you know that that Im just a fool that Im nothing without you in February I told my heart that you would stay so before you head out to the brand new city please listen to me

you are perfect I think youre worth it every second of my life dont know where were goin but its ok cause I got you with me

sometimes I wonder what we could e if we were one
If we were together I would hold your hand in front of my friends just to show you 
you're my best friend my only chance
