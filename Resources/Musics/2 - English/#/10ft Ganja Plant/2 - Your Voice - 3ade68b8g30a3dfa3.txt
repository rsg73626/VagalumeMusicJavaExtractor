YOUR VOICE

First there was the word and the word was
First there was the word and the word was
Your voice leads your life
Spoken by action, friction and vibration
Bring peace into your life

Iâ€™ve got to thank you for the love that you give to me
Thank you for the love that you give to me every day
Thank you for the love that you bring to me
Thank you for the love that you give to me every day
Night and day

Your voice leads your life
Spoken by action, friction and vibration
Bring peace. Bring some peace into your life
Through your voice
Your voice love and stipulation.

Thank you for the love that you give to me 
Thank you for the love that you bring to me every day
Night and day
