THE MONKEY AND THE ONION

See the monkey peel the onion
See the monkey cry
He can feel his tears are flowin'
But he don't know why 

He continues peeling faster
'Til the onion is no more
Now at last his cryin's over
But all he had is gone
Whatever for 

You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems 

If I tell you that I love you
Don't ask how much
And don't ask why
Have no doubt and ask no questions
Just believe it's not a lie 

Never take my love for granted
But never put it to the test
Like the monkey and his onion
Too much investigation
You know the rest 

You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems 

On that we could be contented
With the good things that we've gained
But in the end we're empty handed
Just because we need the world explained
