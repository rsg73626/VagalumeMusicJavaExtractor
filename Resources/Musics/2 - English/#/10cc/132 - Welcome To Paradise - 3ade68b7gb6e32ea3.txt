WELCOME TO PARADISE

i kissed my mother
shook the hand of my brother
and i said goodbye to the woman i loved
it may seem like a madness
to be leaving the love nest
but i'm taking a chance on a place far away 

welcome to paradise
who said you can't live twice
you will find heaven is here on earth
welcome to paradise
did somebody say . . . 

there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
bad vibrations (there's a coup coming on)
feeling the tension (there's a coup coming on)
no smoke without fire (there's a coup coming on) 

i could smell the danger
never dance with a stranger
but the music took me and soon i was lost
so i questioned a lady
but her answers were crazy
and before i knew i was counting the cost 

welcome to paradise
love it but don't look twice
you'll soon be living in make believe
welcome to paradise
did somebody say . . . 

there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
somebody help me (there's a coup coming on)
(welcome to paradise)
so much i don't follow (there's a coup coming on)
(welcome to paradise)
i'm not looking for trouble (there's a coup coming on)
(welcome to paradise)
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on 

i shouldn't have come
no i shouldn't have come
why did i come, hey! 

the clouds were gathering
and the temperature rising
be no turning back all my bridges were burned
then it hit me, jumped up and bit me
now i'm under your spell i can never return 

this is your paradise
now you must pay the price
you should have flown
when the coup was blown
welcome to paradise
did somebody say . . . 

there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
A band on the run
Annie get your gun
