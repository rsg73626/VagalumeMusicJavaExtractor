OVERDRAFT IN OVERDRIVE

I got a letter this morning
My overdraft's in overdrive
They wanna know what I'm gonna do about it
How I'm proposing to survive
Stay alive stay alive oooh
They want the money
so I work and work and work ......
They're making me roast
The cheque's in the post
You needn't worry worry worry....
You hit the roof when I'm on the floor
Did I ever let you down before 

I got a letter from my broker
He say he broker than me
My silver mine has tarnished over
I'm on the road to tragedy
Help me, help me, oooooh
I need the money
so I work and work and work.....
I'm deeper in debt, I'm covered in sweat
You make me worry, worry, worry....
This nightmare's giving me the shakes
Hope I wake and find it's all a mistake 

I started with nothing, and worked my way down
I know the things that I do, they mystify you
It's a strange way of living
But I like playing with fire
I'm always walking the wire
And when the tightrope snaps
You'll see my world collapse 

I got a letter this morning
Must be my lucky day
Seems I've inherited a fortune
Rich Uncle Sam passed away, away, away, ooooh
I'm in the money
No more work and work and work.....
My banker's aghast, I'm dripping with cash
No need to worry, worry, worry.....
You need an angel to survive
An overdraft in overdrive
