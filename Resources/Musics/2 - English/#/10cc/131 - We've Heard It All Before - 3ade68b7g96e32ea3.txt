WE'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE

Einstein, he said, nothings original
Find something new, That's easy for him to say
Took his whole life explaining his theory
Try squeezing your life into 3 minute songs like 

"My love, your face is a symphony
You play the strings of my heart
Say that we never shall part
If you say goodbye, then I'll surely die without you" 

Oh, we've heard it all before
Oh, we've heard it all before
Don't wanna hear it anymore
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy) 

We've come a long way from mono to stereo
Mozart would freak at the crap on the radio
Hits are produced by computer technology
Stick it in one end and it comes out the other 

"My love, your face is a symphony
You play the strings of my heart
Say that we never shall part
If you say goodbye, then I'll surely die without you" 

Oh, we've heard it all before
Oh, we've heard it all before
Don't wanna hear it anymore
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy) 

You plug us in and we regurgitate the hits
Bombard your senses with sound of microchips
Program it digitally into the top five
Brainwash your ears, is it tape or is it live?...live, live, live.. 

Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)
Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)
Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)
Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)
Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)
Don't wanna hear it anymore
