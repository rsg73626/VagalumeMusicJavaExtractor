BLUEBIRD

Bluebird take me on your wing
Teach me how to fly
Teach me how to sing
Bluebird, guardian of my soul
Inside everybody
Is a story to be told 

I came in from the cold
When I found someone
Strong enough to bear
The strain of our existence
And troubles everywhere
But time heals
And I know you'll be there... ooh 

Bluebird symphony in flight
Symbol of the dawn
Symbol of the night
I'll try with all my might to be a brother
Always there for you
Mother (mother, mother) knowing what to do 

And farther than anyone has flown
Courage to spread your wings alone
And who will help me?
Bluebird 

Bluebird stranger to these shores
I look into your eyes
Have you been here before 

Take me through the door to Heaven
And show me
The treasures that you keep
The magic of the sky
And the beauty of the deep 

And I'll do what I have to do
To be one of the chosen few
Fly anywhere with...
You, Bluebird 

Bluebird, Bluebird (Yeh)
