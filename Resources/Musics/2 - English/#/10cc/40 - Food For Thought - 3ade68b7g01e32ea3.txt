FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Milk and honey
Your lips are milk and honey oh oh
Overflowing
You get my juices going
Sweet and tasty
Your love is sweet and tasty oh oh
Skin so creamy
Your body's soft and dreamy 

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Filling me up with your love
I can't control my hands 

Champagne kisses
You give me champagne kisses oh oh
Cool my passion
Slow down my fast reaction
Hot and spicy
Your love is hot and spicy oh oh
Something's burning
Down in your life I'm turning 

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Filling me up with your love
I can't control my hands 

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Oh don't let me down
I'll starve without your love 

Starve without your love
Starve without your love
Starve without your love
Starve without your love
Starve without your love 

Something's cooking
I know that something's cooking oh oh
In your kitchen
I feel my hunger rising
So feed my senses
Come on and feed my senses oh oh
I'm not starving
I need a second helping 

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Filling me up with your love
I can't control my hands 

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Oh don't let me down
I'll starve without your love
