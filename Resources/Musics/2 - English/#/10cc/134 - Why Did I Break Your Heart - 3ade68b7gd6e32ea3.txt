WHY DID I BREAK YOUR HEART

Inside my loneliness and sorting through the mess 
I came across a bunch of snaps and letters 
I found an eight by ten, taken God knows when 
It took me back to when we found each other 
How did I let it start 
If I could only remember 
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
The tender parts we played 
I thought we had it made 
The recipe for life, the perfect fusion 
But when the love turned sour 
I found the happy hour 
But drinking for the world is no solution 
How did I let it start 
If I could only remember 
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
Can't we go back to the start 
I needed someone to tell me 
Why did I break your heart 
The cost of loving is a heavy burden 
Somebody's gotta take the strain 
The things we said would make a cover story 
But who's gonna say 
Who should take all the blame 
We analysed ourselves 
It didn't really help 
No one to referee, no rhyme no reason 
I thought we had the best 
But when you flew the nest 
My heart decided it was open season 
How did I let it start 
If I could only remember 
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
Can't we go back to the start 
I needed someone to tell me 
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
Why did I break your heart.....
