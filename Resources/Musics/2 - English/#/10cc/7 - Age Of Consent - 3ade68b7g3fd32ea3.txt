AGE OF CONSENT

I want to meet you at that restaurant
The one you love it's got a pretty front
What a front
The girls are holding hands
It's a treat to indulge
Or we can sit awhile and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 

This is the age of consent
You don't have to be coy
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything that the traffic allows 

We touch each other then we sip the wine
We smile and nod together, this is fine, it's so fine
Come on in the water's fine
We can jump right in
Or we can look around and bide our time
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 

This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything 

I'm not holding you back Heaven's sake
Have you got to jump out of the cake
I don't want your endeavours to fail
But that pouch has got a sting in the tail
Sting in the tail 

This little place has got me in a trance
We're getting closer but it's just a dance, just a dance
The band won't make a sound
We can warm it up
Or we can hold it back and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 

This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything can be yours, but don't shout....
