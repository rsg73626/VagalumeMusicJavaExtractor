DON'T SQUEEZE ME LIKE TOOTHPASTE

I treat you like a woman
So treat me like a man
I took you to a better place
And helped you understand 

[CHORUS]
So don't squeeze me like toothpaste
Like putty in your hands
I'm gonna go away, I'm gonna blow away 

A woman is a woman
And a man is just a fool
It takes all of the heartaches
And life can be so cruel 

[CHORUS] 

Who's gonna be there when the morning comes?
Head on the pillow, smiling at me
I get up and make the coffee
It must be love, it must be love 

Who's gonna be there when the morning comes?
Head on the pillow, smiling at me
I get up and make the coffee
It must be love, it must be love 

I treat you like a woman
So treat me like a man
I took you to a better place
And helped you understand 

[CHORUS]

DON'T SQUEEZE ME LIKE TOOTHPASTE

I treat you like a woman
So treat me like a man
I took you to a better place
And helped you understand 

[CHORUS]
So don't squeeze me like toothpaste
Like putty in your hands
I'm gonna go away, I'm gonna blow away 

A woman is a woman
And a man is just a fool
It takes all of the heartaches
And life can be so cruel 

[CHORUS] 

Who's gonna be there when the morning comes?
Head on the pillow, smiling at me
I get up and make the coffee
It must be love, it must be love 

Who's gonna be there when the morning comes?
Head on the pillow, smiling at me
I get up and make the coffee
It must be love, it must be love 

I treat you like a woman
So treat me like a man
I took you to a better place
And helped you understand 

[CHORUS]
