TAKE THESE CHAINS

Baby baby oh baby
I'd love to love you
But my hands are tied
Break these chains
Oh oh these chains that are killing me 

You don't need money if you've got love
We've got each other and its more than enough
Break these chains
Oh oh these chains that are holding me 

Ooh ooh my love
It's all too much for me to take 

Take these chains
Take these chains 

She never thought that I could live without her
All the little things she used to do
Then I fell in love with you
You found me
You took me in
When no one wanted me 

Making love on a sandy beach
The stars above us and we're clean out of reach
Of my chains
oh oh the chains that were killing me 

And you make everything a paradise
And paradise with you is twice as nice
Never change, never change what you're doing to me 

Never change
Never change
