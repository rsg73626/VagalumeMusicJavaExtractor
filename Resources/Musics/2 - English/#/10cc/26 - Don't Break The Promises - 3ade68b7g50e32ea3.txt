DON'T BREAK THE PROMISES

You know i cannot always be there with you
When something crazy takes me far away
We must stick together through this madness
I've got so many things i want to say
Too many forces try to come between us
So little time to share and talk to you
If i show my hand to you in panic
Please remember what i'm going through
I've loved you forever
But it seems like a day
And i want to be there with you
I didn't want it this way
Don't think i don't trust in you
I just needed to say
Don't break the promises
That we made today, oh no
Don't break the promises
Do you remember counting every moment
Before the world we knew was torn apart
Now when i close my eyes i can be with you
But are we really dancing in the dark
A bad connection leads us to confusion
We're all too easily misunderstood
Oh we've been together through these nightmares
And now we've got a chance to make it good
I've loved you forever
But it seems like a day
And i want to be there with you
I didn't want it this way
Don't think i don't trust in you
I just needed to say
Don't break the promises
That we made today, oh no
Don't break the promises
That we made today
Don't you break the promises
(don't break the promises, promises)
If you do you'll be breaking my heart
(don't break the promises that you made)
Oh don't forget the things we said
(promises, promises)
At the start oh no
I've loved you forever
But it seems like a day
And i want to be there with you
I didn't want it this way
Don't think i don't trust in you
I just needed to say
Don't break the promises
That we made today, oh no
Don't break the promises
That we made today
Don't break the promises
That we made today
DON'T BREAK THE PROMISES
