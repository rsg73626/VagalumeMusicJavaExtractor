SHOCK ON THE TUBE (DON'T WANT LOVE)

I was travelling home on the subway
When this vision got on at Maida Vale
And as I casually eyed the classifieds
She sat down next to me
Every head in the carriage was wondering
I replied with a smile on my face
And as I slipped into the arms of Morpheus
To daydream the rest of the way 

She was a smooth operator
You could see it in her dress
I said I'd like to see you later
But I didn't want to press 

I was homing like a scanner
Did a mental strip tease
But she knew that she was special
And she came on like a tease 

Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love 

She was a headstrong woman
With a demon in her blood
Through the window in her eyes
I saw fire in her soul
And I knew if I pursued it
My fingers would be burned
Like a moth round a candle
I was momentarily stunned 

Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love 

The carriage was spinning
We were up on the floor
She was whirling like a dervish
I was whirling like a fool
My reactions were dimming
Like an alcoholic haze
I could hear people clapping
I was stumbling in a daze
I was stumbling in a daze
My eyes tried to focus
I was suddenly aware
She was newborn naked
I was altogether bare
There were shouts all around us
There were clothes on the floor
As I tried to find my senses
I was sliding down the door 

Down a coal black tunnel
I was slipping away
Then I felt the water hit me
And I heard somebody say
Better get yourself together
This is the end of the line
When I looked for my woman
I'd been dreaming all the time 

Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
