ALL SEATS TAKEN

Dont need no ticket
Dont need no reservation
I've got my table set for two
Dont bring no money,
Just your imagination
For all the things that we can do.
I skip my entree
N'stick to table water
I've got my main course for desert
I dim the lights
The dj can take a hike
Cause we dont need no chaprone tonightcause all i want is what you got
All seats taken
And all i dont is what you're not
No mistaken
And all i want is what you got
All seats taken
