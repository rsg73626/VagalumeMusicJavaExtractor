THE STARS DIDN'T SHOW

We came from miles around
Just to listen to your sound
You made the night seem endless
You cast a magic spell
You played the part so well
Your music blew away the darkness
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
But we never took you for granted
Your lives were a blessing
But they carried a curse
The night that the stars didn't show
You made me stand so proud
I was lifted from the crowd
The fire inside me burning
The figure dressed in black
Sending shivers down my back
Deep inside my soul was stirring
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
The sweet inspiration that you gave us
And i can remember we didn't rehearse
The night that the stars didn't show
Mountains may crumble
And worlds fall apart
Lovers and friends may desert me
The road may be long
But i know in my heart
Your spirit will always be with me
The thrill to be up there
A sea of faces everywhere
I look i find you
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
But we never took you for granted
Your lives were a blessing
But they carried a curse
The night that the stars didn't show
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
The sweet inspiration that you gave us
And i can remember we didn't rehearse
The night that the stars didn't show
