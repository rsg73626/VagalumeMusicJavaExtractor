HOW'M I EVER GONNA SAY GOODBYE

I've been thinkin' writin' you a letter
Maybe telegram would be better
I'll be worried how it's gonna get there
So I go and change my mind 

Need a little time to chew it over
But every day I grow a little older
Got de devil sittin' on me shoulder
Gonna make me change my mind 

Got me drinkin' even got me smokin'
Got me sinkin' nearly got me chokin'
What'll you do in the morning
What'll you do in the morning
When I'm gone 

Thought I'd better have me a vacation
Got my ticket made my reservation
Want my name address and occupation
So I go and change my mind
How'm I ever gonna say goodbye
How'm I ever gonna go to sleep at night
How'm I ever gonna close my eyes
How'm I ever gonna sleep alone at night
