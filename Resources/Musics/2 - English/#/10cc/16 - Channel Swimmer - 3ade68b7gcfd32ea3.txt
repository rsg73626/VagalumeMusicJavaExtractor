CHANNEL SWIMMER

Well it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me 

I've greased my body
and I'm heading over the ocean
These two arms are the only locomotion
I need 

See me swim and see me float
I don't need no motorboat
or a yacht to get me there 

I'll do the breaststroke
and the backstroke
I'll do anything
I'll be swimming when you're all asleep
I'll be swimming when you're all awake
I'll do the sidestroke
the other sidestroke
I'll do the butterfly
But I ain't gonna crawl
on back to you, no way 

I see your face in every breaker
I see your smile across the reef
I came across the sea to take you
Don't make me out to be a thief 

You'll be dreaming when you're all asleep
But I'll be drowning when you're all awake
I did the breaststroke
I did my best stroke
I did everything
But I ain't good enough 

'Cause it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me...
would forget he can't swim
