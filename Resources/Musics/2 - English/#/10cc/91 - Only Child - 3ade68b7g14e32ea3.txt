ONLY CHILD

I never had a little sister
No brother to tell my troubles to
My nights were oh so sad and lonely
Until the day that I met you 

Some people say it isn't healthy
To be the only one around
That's why I get a little edgy
Don't want to lose what I have found
'Cause I'm an only child 

You are the light at the end of the tunnel
You are the sun and the moon and sky
You are my sister mother lover
Without you, babe, I'm gonna die 

Some people say it isn't healthy
To be the only one around
That's why I get a little edgy
Don't want to lose what I have found
'Cause I'm an only child
