TOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY

I'll tell you something you oughta know
We came a long way from the radio
But what's wrong with that?
Baby's what's wrong with that? 

Now we got microchips, sci fi flicks
We got tomorrow's world today 

Now there's something that I gotta say
Do you remember only yesterday
We had Blue Suede Shoes
Yeh, and we had Howard Hughes 

Now we got holograms, CB hams
We got tomorrow's world today 

At a time when the world is changing
Faster than ever before
Don't lose sight of the human touch
'Cause we ain't seen nothing yet
Oh no, we ain't seen nothing yet, uh huh 

Now the children of the future
May take a trip to Mars
They might meet the Space Invaders on their way
'Cause we ain't seen nothing yet
Oh no, we ain't seen nothing yet, uh huh 

Wish I had a calculator when I was at school
I was a simple mathematical fool
But now all that's changed
Yeh, we got computer games 

And we got transplants, sperm banks
and body scanners
All there to help us survive
So we should think we're lucky
We got tomorrow's world today
