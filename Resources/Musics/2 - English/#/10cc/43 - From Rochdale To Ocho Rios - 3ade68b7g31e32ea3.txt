FROM ROCHDALE TO OCHO RIOS

From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
From Ocho Rios to Dorking
From Dorking its back to Rochdale
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios 

You spend half your life in transit
But that's just the way God plans it
Pack a shirt and some fresh pajamas
That's all you need 

Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa 

When I look into your blue eyes
I bend the truth but I never tell you lies
I need my lover, I need your care
Understandings not enough to make it fair 

From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
From Ocho Rios to Dorking
From Dorking its back to Rochdale
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios 

Asleep in a stream of sunlight
Awake in a dream at midnight
I'm rushing to wait for jumbo
Oh where am I now 

Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa 

A dressing room so far from home
A corridor with a broken telephone
I wanna call but I got to go
The curtains up and it's time to do the show 

Show time! 

I just got in to the city
Yeah, it's so insane
But the man with the suitcase
is on the road again 

Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa 

Asleep in a stream of sunlight
Awake in a dream at midnight
I'm rushing to wait for jumbo
Oh where am I now 

You spend half your life in transit
But that's just the way God plans it
Pack a shirt and some fresh pajamas
That's all you need 

Everybody sing!
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
From Ocho Rios to Dorking
From Dorking its back to Rochdale
Oh where are we now
