YVONNE'S THE ONE

When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted
And her laughter flowed into my life
She seemed so right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
So I waited for the magic to start
Somebody touch me deep in my heart

Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, "Hold on
You're not the only one"
And so I said, "You're wrong Yvonne"

When I saw her again, I was caught in a landslide
But I didn't dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So I waited for the magic to start
But I know it's gonna tear us apart

Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, "Hold on
You're not the only one"
And so I said, "You're wrong Yvonne"

She'll never know how much I loved her
I never got to tell
We never had the chance to say farewell

When I last saw Yvonne
She was covered in roses
But the laughter had gone from her eyes
She walked so tall, looked so grand
Everything about her truly planned
But what you get is not what you see
"So long Yvonne you're not fooling me"

Yvonne's the one I've been counting on
She said, "Hold on, you're not the only one"
And so I said, "So long Yvonne"
