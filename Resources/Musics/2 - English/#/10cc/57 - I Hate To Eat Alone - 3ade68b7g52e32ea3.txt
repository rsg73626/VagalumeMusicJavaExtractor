I HATE TO EAT ALONE

I picked myself up in a downtown bar
You know the feelin' was lousy
But as I'd come this far
Well it's too easy to drink
When nobody's home
But I hate to eat alone 

'N' frozen dinners don't do much for me
When you've got T.V. on the table
'N' T.V. on T.V.
All you do is chew your fingers
Down to the bone
I hate to eat alone 

Like the actor who's forgotten his words
You stumble through the story line
Another place another time
When you were with me 

They say the city's rotten to the core
There's no communication with each other anymore
But we stopped talkin' to each other a long time before
And I hate to eat alone 

Hear it in my words
See it in my eyes
Since you went away
I wear a cheap disguise
Waitin' for the mornin'
Waitin' on the light
Hopin' for the sunshine
Before the night 

I didn't tell you that I had to change
So you just took it for granted
That we'd remain the same
I know that nobody's guilty
No one's to blame so I end up on my own
God I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
