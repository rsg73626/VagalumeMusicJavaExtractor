HONEYMOON WITH 'B' TROOP

My baby, shes crazy, shes lazy
So shes always bummin around
Girls in france dont stand a chance
`cos Ive always got my baby around
So, dont touch her
Oh, its so fine, and you know whats mine is mine
At night we, sleep tight we
Stay close together `cos the temperatures down
But baby, says maybe
Each time I try to get my fingers around
Please dont touch her
Sittin with a tentpole, what a bloody jamboree
Listen to our motto, be prepared for ecstasy
Here comes the bride
My baby, goes topless
And brings her beauty to a bottomless day
Shes bathing, al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display
So, dont get too close
Oh shes so fine, and you know whats mine is mine
Ooh its a drag when youre hitched to a dream
And the boys in the gang think shes part of the scenery
Youre never alone and the tension is painful to see
One night i, crept in and,
Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life
Now wed like to.......
