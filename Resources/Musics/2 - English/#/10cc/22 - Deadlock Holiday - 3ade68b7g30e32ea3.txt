DEADLOCK HOLIDAY

I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me 
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
Got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said "I'll give you one dollar"
I said "you got to be jokin' man,
it was a present from me Mother"
He said "I like it, I want it,
I'll take it off your hands 
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone,
A long way from home!"

I say
I don't like reggae no no
I love it
I don't like reggae
I love it
Don't you cramp me style 
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' Pina Calarda
I heard a dark voice beside me say
"Would you like something harder"
She said "I've got it, you want it, 
My harvest is the best
And if you try it, you'll like it
And whollow in a Dreadlock Holiday"

And I say
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her oh yea
Don't you walk through her words
Got to show some respect
Don't you walk through her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet

I don't like cricket
I love it DREADLOCK HOLIDAY
I don't like reggae
I love it DREADLOCK HOLIDAY
Don't like Jamaica
I love it DREADLOCK HOLIDAY
