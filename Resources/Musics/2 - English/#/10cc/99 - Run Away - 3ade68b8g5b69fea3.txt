RUN AWAY

Remember I'm the one who didn't have a lot to say
I was trying to find the courage, but I let you walk away
And I can't forget your face, y'know it haunts me all the time
And it seems to me you're living in a dream
Wish we could run away, we could be alone together
Far away, leave the world behind
Runaway, runaway, what I want to say is
You're a part of me, let me be a part of you
I want to tell you what I'm thinking, but the words get in the way
When I'm sitting here alone I find the things I meant to say
If I wrote them in a letter, would you read between the lines
Would you understand how much I really care
Wish we could run away, we could be alone together
Far away, leave the world behind
Runaway, runaway, what I want to say is
You're a part of me, let me be a part of you
[I] I love you
[Need] I need you
[You] Don't want to live without you
If I'm backward counting forward, would you help me realize
All the answers to the questions I've been asking with my eyes
I could hand you all the cliches, but you've heard them all before
And I want to say I love you in my own way
And could we run away, we could be alone together
Far away, leave the world behind
Runaway, runaway, what I want to say is
You're a part of me, let me be a part of you
Runaway, runaway, we could be alone together
Far away, leave the world behind
Runaway, I love you, I need you
What I want to say is, I want you
You're a, I love you, part of me, I need you
Let me be a part of you
