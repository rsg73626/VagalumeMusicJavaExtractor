LOST IN LOVE

A far bit beyond this place
All the stars have been cast
You may try to resist the pace
But it's happening too fast
The desire is so strong
Yeah you got to concede
There's no way to escape from the trap
We are slaves to our needs 

And we're lost in love
(Y'say) We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
And we're lost in love
(Say it) We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay together
Whoa, heart to heart, forever
Whoa, heart to heart, together
Whoa, heart to heart
Heart to heart 

The stage has been set tonight
And the die has been cast
Curtain up and the music begins
Oh the audience cares???
Tragedy is feelin'
For the rest of your days
Nothing will ever compare to the thrill of the stage 

And we're lost in love
(I'm sayin') We're lost in our love and we can't find a way (baby, baby)
Lost in love (no, no)
(Sayin') We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay together
Whoa, heart to heart, forever
Whoa, heart to heart, together
Whoa, heart to heart
Heart to heart 

Curtain will fall at the end of the day
Guardian angels will kill for their pay
Impossible dreams have to end
Let the crowd disappear, we've got nothing to fear 

We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
[Repeat to fade]
