DON'T

If you want love to stay
Don't give all your secrets away
It's not the fashion
But hold back your passion 

Don't - open your heart, no
Don't - share all your dreams in one night, no
Don't - tell the whole story
Why should you hurry? 

You don't want love to leave
So don't wear your heart on your sleeve
It's not a crime to
Give her some time and 

Don't - drive her away, no
Don't - love isn't built in a day, no
Don't - let it grow stronger
Feed in the hunger 

Hold back your passion 

You're not an open book
So don't let her take just one look
Under the cover
Let her discover 

Don't - stop the surprising, no
Don't - take all the mystery out of it, no
Don't - put out the fire
Kill her desire 

Don't - open your heart, no
Don't - share all your dreams in one night, no
Don't - tell the whole story
Why should you hurry? 

Don't -
Don't -
Don't -
