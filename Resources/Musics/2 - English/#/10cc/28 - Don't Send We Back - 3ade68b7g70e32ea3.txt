DON'T SEND WE BACK

We came across from Korea
We braved the wind and the rain
We came a thousand miles just to be here
And you want to send we back again 

We crossed Malaysian waters
We sailed the South China Sea
We stopped at Singapore and Jakarta
And you want to send we back to sea 

Don't send we back, have mercy upon us
We know you don't want us but we've got no one
Don't send we back, we've run out of water
We won't last the morning in the baking sun 

The Indonesian Islands
We stopped at every one
As for the Philippines we tried 'em
And you want to turn our boat around
