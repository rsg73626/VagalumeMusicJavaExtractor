SHIPS DON'T DISAPPEAR IN THE NIGHT (DO THEY)

Ships don't just disappear in the night
Do they?
People don't really die of fright
Do they?
We all know it just ain't so 

So don't be afraid when the table shakes
Don't you
Don't be amazed when your shadow quakes
Don't you
Start to pray they'll go away 

And then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya 

Better be nice to Vincent Price 

Forces at work that we don't understand
Are they?
So don't get the shits if it touches your hand
Don't you
Poltergeists can be so nice 

Better be nice to Vincent Price 

What's that noise comin' up from the cellar?
What's it?
It's the restless bones of Boris and Bela
Boris and Bela
Don't go down, they're still around 

But then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya 

And then they can't do nothin' to ya
They can't do nothin' to ya
They just keep walkin' through ya
