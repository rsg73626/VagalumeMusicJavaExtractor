CITY LIGHTS

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights 

Home from work got your money in your pocket
Pull on your boots brand new suit
If you had the chance you'd hock it
For a night on the tiles
And a shot of midnight fever
Get off your back get on the track
Tune in your receiver oh oh 

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights 

Truck down the street feeling kinda funky
Get on the beat shuffle your feet
Never know you might get lucky
You got love on the brain
Flashing like a neon
Feed 'em a line
Give 'em a sign
They're looking for a come on oh oh 

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights 

No way to stop when the music's in your body
Into the night feel all right
No time for feeling sorry
You go down to the club
With the old familiar faces
Buy 'em a drink kick up a stink
Everybody's going crazy oh oh 

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights 

To the bright city lights
To the bright city lights
To the bright city lights
Oh I love those city lights
