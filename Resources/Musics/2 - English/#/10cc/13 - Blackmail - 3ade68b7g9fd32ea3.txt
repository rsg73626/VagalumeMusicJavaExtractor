BLACKMAIL

She doesn't need money 
She doesn't need diamonds 
She's lookin' for pretty things 
She doesn't want romance 

She doesn't need finance 
She's looking for rendezvous 
But every time she's going down 
She never looks around 

I'll wait and watch her with my 
lens until she brings the curtain down 
'There behind the keyhole' 
With my fisheye 

I'm back in the darkroom 
I'm covered in fixer 
I'm making a photograph 
I'll send her some postcards 

In glorious colour 
I'm keeping the negatives 
I'll form a letter from the news 
With different type from different lines 

I'll tell the world about her 
I'll mail the People and the Times 
'Oo it'll be so scandalous 
For the both of them 

But mainly her' 
She showed them her husband 
He ordered a dozen 
He thought they were fabulous 

The one with the -------------- 
The two of the ---------------- 
And three of the -------------- 

He sold her to Hefner 
Who put her in Playboy 
He gave her a centre-fold 
I made a real blunder 
She made it in movies 
I made her a superstar
