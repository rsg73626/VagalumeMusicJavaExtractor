LYING HERE WITH YOU

Time to wave the day goodbye
But I don't wanna hear no lullaby
Sandman takes his cue
And when the night is through
I'll be lying here with you 

Close your eyes turn out the light
Say a prayer to see us through the night
Hope your dreams come true
When dawn turns into blue
I'll be lying here with you 

Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say
I only know what I must do 

All our cares will drift away
Leave them all until another day
I don't really mind
As long as I can find
That I'm lying here with you 

Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say
I only know what I must do 

All our cares will drift away
Leave them all until another day
I don't really mind
As long as I can find
That I'm lying here with you
