MEMORIES

The summers were longer, they went on forever
Oh and the sky so blue
We never worried about anything
We didn't question the nature of things
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so 

Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown 

We dream in the night, of mythical days
And nights in white satin
But when the child wakes, the fantasy breaks
We didn't know what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Something was growing inside me
Oh and I loved you so 

Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown 

Photographs, faded photographs
Holidays, summer holidays
First love, broken promises
All a play, I'm going back to yesterday 

The feeling was stronger, if went on forever
Oh and your eyes were true
We were so wrapped up in all of our dreams
We didn't care what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so...... 

Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown
