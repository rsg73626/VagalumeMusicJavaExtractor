ROCK 'N' ROLL LULLABY

Listen while I sing you to sleep
With a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Close your eyes and don't you peep
This is a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Sandman's gonna get you 

Snuggle down your sleepy head
It's gettin' late the Sandman said
Your dreams are waiting
It's daybreak in the land of nod
So get to sleep you little sod
Your dreams are waiting 

And if you get a nightmare
Would you go and shake your Ma
Cause your Daddy's been a workin' all day
And if you go and get a glass of water by yourself
You can show us that you're older than you are
Show us that you're older 

The Sandman's gonna get you 

Well you're too small to understand 
You're living in a wonderland
Your dreams are waitin' 

If only we could be there too
And dream a dream along with you
Your dreams are waitin' 

Careful that you don't get out the wrong side of the cot
Are you gonna be an angel or a devil
You're too small to reason what is right and what is wrong
Childhood dreams are gone too fast
There's no way we can make them last 

We'll always love you anyway
Any way you are
Any way you are
