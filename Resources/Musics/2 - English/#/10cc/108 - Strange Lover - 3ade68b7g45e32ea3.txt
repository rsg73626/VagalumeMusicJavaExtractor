STRANGE LOVER

Baby Baby Baby don't hurry
You've got your finger on me
Don't let go, no no no
I know you love it
It's running through my veins
You drink me dry
You take so much of me
And when you touch me
I see the magic in your eyes
And I can't move (I'm going under)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever 

Baby Baby don't make me worry
You only live for the night
It's not right, no no no
But in the morning
You seem to disappear
Here come the night
You seem to reappear
Is this a warning?
I've got a feeling you're not
Telling me the truth (you cast no shadow)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever 

Strange Lover, pale as the moon
You've no shadow, no face in the mirror
No complection, no reflection 

Baby Baby Baby you're freezing
You send a shiver through me
I'm so cold, no no no
The day is dawning
We're moving underground
I must go with you
I start to realise
Your touch is deadly
I wanna look away
But I can't look away
I'm in your power and I'm lost
