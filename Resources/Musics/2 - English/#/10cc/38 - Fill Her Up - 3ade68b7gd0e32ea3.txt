FILL HER UP

my baby told me she would meet me on the street
stood behind a lamppost, I could only see her feet
now I'm not one to grumble, don't want to be a bore
but that silly bitch Jane Fonda's got a lot to answer for
told the women of the world that the only way to win
work out 'til you burn out and you'll get super slim
i rushed her to the restaurant and called the maitre d', oh help me 

fill her up, fill her up
load up, load up
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep it coming, keep it coming
never let it stop 

we staggered from the restaurant feeling in the pink
i slipped into the liquor store and gave the man a wink
my baby got the shivers, said you've got to stop and think
what you're doing to your body with this evil demon drink
said the poison that you're buying gonna eat away your brain
i said you'd better listen up before you go insane
knocked her off her soapbox, rushed her to the bar, and shouted 

fill her up, fill her up
down 'em, drown 'em
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep 'em coming, keep 'em coming
never let them stop 

that's right, one more
tequilla sunrise with a little umbrella on it
okay, encore
a bloody mary with a little shot of bourbon on the side 

too many moaning minnies
they're out to spoil our fun
watch out for sister anna
she's the one who bangs the drum
bang the drum 

now you may think i'm worried by the screwballs that i meet
just to prove i'm not i'll throw a party in the street
everyone's invited, but you've got to take the pledge
leave behind your scruples, let me take you to the edge
everything in moderation that's the golden rule
take away all pleasure, that seems kind of cruel
to give the people power got to give them fuel, so i say 

fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop 

fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop 

fill her up, fill her up... [repeat to fade]
