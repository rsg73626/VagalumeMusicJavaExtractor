GROW OLD WITH ME

You said you will
You said I do
Now that's the best thing
For me and you
We'll stick together our whole lives through
Grow old with me 

Starting out just the two of us
Pretty soon they'll be a few of us
We'll love and cherish and give our trust
Grow old with me 

Pretty face got it all worked out
What we did today leaves me in no doubt
That dreams come true
And now I'm whole
I fell in love - heart and soul 

You've given more than words can say
You took the lead and you showed the way
A new beginning for us today
Grow old with me

Grow old with me 

Pretty face got it all worked out
What we did today leaves me in no doubt
That dreams come true
And now I'm whole
I fell in love - heart and soul 

You said you will
You said I do
Now that's the best thing
For me and you
We'll stick together our whole lives through
Any fool can see - you're gonna
Grow old with
Old with me
Grow old with me
