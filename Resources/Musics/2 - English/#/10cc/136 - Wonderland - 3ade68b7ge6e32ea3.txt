WONDERLAND

i wanna take a giant step
don't know where I'll end up yet
the devil or the deep blue sea
there's always someone watching over me
the power of communication
every little word's a big sensation
sitting in the palm of my hand
everyone at my command 

it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 

i'd like to introduce you to
a special substance, good for you
no physical dependency
for a star in its ascendancy
the world is a great big oyster
i'm riding through on a roller coaster
i'm looking at exotic places
but i'm colour blind to all these faces 

it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 

live while you can
everyday's a holiday
these are the golden years
and they won't be coming round again
so little time to be wild and free
so many things that you want to be
so little space between the cradle and the grave
but the minutes are ticking away
these are the special times
and they won't be coming round again woh oh woh 

people take me for a ride
but I'm feeling good inside
the consequence of love and pain
and I'm not the one who takes the blame
my head is on another planet
my thoughts are soothed
by the hands upon it
a simple trade in real affection
and I'm not alone in the twilight zone 

it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 

it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 

it's a wonderland....
