LISTEN WITH YOUR EYES

I don't need no special things to get me high
All I needs a touch of Ron to get me by
I see people travelling, never make a move
I don't follow my leader, needles in the groove
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
People selling me heaven, praying to the sky
I don't read their message
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes (I love it) 

You've had a hustling day
Your life's roundabout anyway
I got my feet on the ground
That doesn't mean I don't get around
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
I love to see a daybreak
It's not a chemical wide awake
I like a rub in the tub
I never want to pull out the plug
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
Mr. Blue! 

People search the dailies, live by horoscope
Looking for direction, don't they get the joke
I won't fear the reaper, when the curtain falls
I'm not vegetating, waiting for the call 

I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
Wake up to the future, you should make your plans
Dreams are made in heaven, life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
