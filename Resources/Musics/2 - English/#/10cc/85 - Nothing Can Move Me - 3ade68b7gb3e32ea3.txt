NOTHING CAN MOVE ME

There's talk about some people
That maybe you know
The heroes and the villains
And the places that they know 

The highest and the finest
The lowest of the low
Just stop and get it through you
There's somewhere you can go 

Tell you what I do when I'm lonely
I'll tell you what I do when I'm blue
Tell you what I do when I'm lonely
I close my eyes and think about you 

[CHORUS]
('Cause) nothing can move me like my rock n roll
Nothing can blow me away
Nothing can move me like my rock n roll do
Nothing can move
Nothing can move
Nothing can move me away 

You wake up in the morning
The wrong side of the bed
The spirit that was in you
is hammering your head 

You crawl up to your hi fi
Select a side or two
Sharpen up your needle
and feel it coming through 

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
