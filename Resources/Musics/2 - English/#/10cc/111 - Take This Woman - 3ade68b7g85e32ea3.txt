TAKE THIS WOMAN

I found myself on my knees in prayer
The consequence of my deep despair
Now I must speak, get it off my chest
It ain't no joke and it ain't no jest 

Every night she would come to me
But her demands brought disharmony
I said, "You can't bring your drums to bed,
Your rhythm method's gonna leave me dead." 

Got to take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away 

It would be churlish of me to complain
But caviar every night is insane
I'm fit to burst, I'm not in the mood
But she say, "Lie down babe, I wanna talk to you." 

Well I'm not fond of your family ties
The hangman's noose in your mother's eyes
You chatterbox like a talking head
Je ne comprends pas the words that you said 

Take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away

Don't want to love you
I really tried
But I'm hook line and sinkered deeply fried
I've got to admit that with all your faults
We touch and it feels like a million volts 

Listen - I realised I'd made a big mistake
I'm only human for heaven's sake
Lord give me strength don't let me falter
I'm gonna take her to the alter 

And I'll take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away 

I'm gonna take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away 

Woh, yeah....
