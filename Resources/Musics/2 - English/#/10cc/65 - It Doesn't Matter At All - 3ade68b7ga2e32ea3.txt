IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL

Hey you've been hanging on
To a dream
Hoping that time
Would turn your fear away
But you must stop
Take a look around
What do you see
Do you see me 

People say that I'm crazy
(People call me a fool)
They've got no business to talk
(They've got no reason at all)
I'll take a chance with you Baby
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all 

Hey you're living in a world
Where reason is a waste of time
Nobody talking
The atmosphere is cold
Touching you deeply
Way down inside you
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved 

People say that I'm crazy
(People call me a fool)
They've got no business to talk
(They've got no reason at all)
I'll take a chance with you Baby
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all 

Hey I've been talked about
The way I've been following you
But I don't give a damn
When it feels so right
But I must find out
Take a look around me
What do I feel
What'll I do 

You see I've been hanging on
To a dream
Hoping you'll find
The love you need in me
Giving you time
To make your mind up
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved 

People say that I'm crazy
(People call me a fool)
They've got no business to talk
(They've got no reason at all)
I'll take a chance with you Baby
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
