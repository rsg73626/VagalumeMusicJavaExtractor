LIFE LINE

Ten thousand miles away from someone
Ten thousand miles away from you
Who's your friend on the end of a telephone line
A telephone line's like a life line 

You run me cool you run me hot love
You take me where I wanna be
Ship to shore, air to land
Seems it's always the same
I always end up with a lame brain 

Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away 

Livin' it up in the paradise
Don't make it right, don't make it wrong
When you know you've got a friend
who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line 

But a walk on the wire
It don't put out no fire
A telephone line's like a life line 

Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away 

When you wake you'll find me sleepin'
The clock don't stop when you're not here
But you know you've got a friend
Who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line
A telephone line is a life line
