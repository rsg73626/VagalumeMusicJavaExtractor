TOKYO

Transistorised, and anodised
Chrome plated, squeaky clean
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you 

You're trembling, you're choking
But you're magical to me
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you 

Kimonos, and Geisha girls
From grade one, down to three
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you 

Land of the rising sun
You have taken my heart away
With your beauty you nearly blinded me
In your beauty I want to stay 

I bow to you with my heart
I think of you every day
When I dream you are there beside me
But when I waken you're far away 

Perfection, in miniature
With tiny hands, smiling eyes
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you
Tokyo 

When I dream you are there beside me
