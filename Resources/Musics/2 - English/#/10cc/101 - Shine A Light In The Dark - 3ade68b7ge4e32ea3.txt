SHINE A LIGHT IN THE DARK

i've been lost before and i had to pay
it was never easy but i found a way
well the journey was hard and the road was tough
there were times when i cried lord i've had enough
please don't desert me now
don't you leave me stranded now i need a friend
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 

show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark 

i've been down and out and i've been fit to drop
but the thought of you wouldn't let me stop
now a man should stand upon his own two feet
because the taste of failure is a bitter sweet
please don't desert me now
i can hear the reaper calling in the wind
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 

show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark 

where were you when the chips were down
i fell apart when i hit the town
where were you when i couldn't get arrested
where were you when the lights went out
i blew a fuse, did you hear me shout
where on earth do i look for heavens sake 

there's a brotherhood that i want to see
gotta take my share of equality
there's no harmony in a one man band
even god almighty needs a helping hand
please don't desert me now
there's no time and i can't fight another day
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 

show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
[repeat to fade]
