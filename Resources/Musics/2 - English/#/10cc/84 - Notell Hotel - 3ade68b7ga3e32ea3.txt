NOTELL HOTEL

I checked into the room and I checked the view
And then I locked and chained the door
I had time to kill I had space to fill
Like a prisoner on the floor
But then the silence broke, there's a woman
screaming down the hall
And I wondered what was going on
Here at the Notell Hotel 

So I killed the light and I slipped the chain
took a peek into the hall
I was just in time to see the waiter trip
and drop the dinner on the floor
But the Bellboy smiled as the elevator started to fall
And I wondered what was going on
down at the Notell Hotel 

Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)
Secret agents, waiting for the missing clue
at a rendezvous 

I heard the sound of feet and I looked out to
meet a girl I knew I'd seen before
She had the kind of looks, you see in dirty books
and she was dripping on the floor
She was taking a shower when someone tiptoed in
and turned out the lights
It's gonna be one of those nights
down at the Notell Hotel 

I took her into my room and picked the lock on the bar
to get a drink to calm her down
Then the mirror cracked as the window shook
and the table turned around
And when I grabbed at the phone
there was a voice at the end of the line
"Is that 1059? Is anything wrong, Is there anything wrong"
here at the Notell Hotel 

Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)
Secret agents, waiting for the missing clue
at a rendezvous
