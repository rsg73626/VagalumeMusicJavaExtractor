TAXI! TAXI!

The hands on the clock seem to stick to the face
But the seconds are turning to minutes
And minutes to days
I try not to look at the grin on it's face
But I know that it knows that I gotta get out
Of this place
Time to close the day
Time to lock the door
time to greet the street
I'm so happy I'm walking on air
People staring but I don't care 

Taxi, call a taxi, yellow taxi, taxi taxi
Don't take the subway don't go that way
'snot a safe way don't go that way
Gotta cross town don't want trouble
Got to get there on the double
She'll be waiting I'll be running
She'll be thinking I'm not coming 

I can't wait to talk to you
Tell you what I'd like to do
We'll find a little restaurant
A little vino for the ambiance
In the candlelight we're holding hands 

Time flies when you really
Don't want it to
The waiters are staring at me
But I've only got eyes for you
Leave us alone we don't wanna go home
Put your chairs on the tables
We can let ourselves out when you've gone
Time to take your home
Time to say goodnight
We don't wanna part
Let's be together tonight
Let's be together tonight 

Taxi, call a taxi, yellow taxi, taxi taxi
Don't take the subway don't go that way
'snot a safe way we'll go our way
Gotta cross town back to my place
Pull the shades down screw the rat race
We're alone now undercover
Hang the sign out don't disturb 

Now I'm really close to you
Tell you what I want to do
I wanna take you to a tropical place
Beneath the stars I'll see the love in your face
In the pale moonlight
We're holding hands
Following the footprints in the sand
It's been a hell of a day in the city
Now it's time to get away
