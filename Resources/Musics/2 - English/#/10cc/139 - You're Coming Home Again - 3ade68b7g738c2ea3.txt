YOU'RE COMING HOME AGAIN

Baby, baby, don't you make a sound
All I'm asking of you is to understand
I can't let you go
When are you coming home again? 

It's so easy to be cold and proud
We should talk it over, we should shout it out
I can't let you go, no no no
When are you coming home again? 

I never dreamed that you would go away
When we had a quarrel we could find a way
But I woke up this morning and I knew it
You were gone 

It's no party when you realize
That you're on your own, nobody hears you cry
You can't believe it, oh baby
When are you coming home again? 

I've been foolish and I brought you down
But I'll make it better, won't you hold me close
I won't let you go, no no no
When you come home again 

I'm no poet, but I tell you so
You're the woman I care for, won't you ever know
I won't let you go, no no no
When you come home again 

I can feel that you'll be coming around
If I hold on to you, can we make it right
I love you so, baby
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
