MARGO WANTS THE MUSTARD

I watch her move up and down the beach, well
The fellows drool, but she's out of their reach, and
These are not a part of the scheme, but
Let them hope, and let them dream
So many dreams in the mind of the men, well
Come to life through a good woman
Margo walks in another place, well
It's in her eyes and it's on her face 

Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 

Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on her life
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top 

She's only got to smile that way well
It lifts your heart, blows your troubles away, and
When she moves, well I've got to say that
This rhythm method goes a long, long way
It's in the bones, and it's in the head
A precious thing that's got to be fed, well
I shouldn't say it, but it must be said
It's even better when it's in your bed 

Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 

Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
She'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top
(A wop bop a loo mop, a lop bom bom) 

I can't explain what she motivates, but
It's all around, but it's hard to relate
It must be close to heavenly bliss oh
How I wish I could bottle this and
I'd splash it out all over the place
Pour it over the human race, yeh
I may be starting another sin, but
Sit right back, watch the fun begin 

Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 

Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top 

Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top...
