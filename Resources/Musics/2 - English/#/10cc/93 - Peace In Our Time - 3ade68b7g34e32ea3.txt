PEACE IN OUR TIME

Thank you for the gift
The freedom to wonder
In search of the light
Are we gonna let it shine
Forgiveness is the key
The perfect emotion
Will you show us the way
To peace in our time 

Where the wild wind blows
The deserts are shiftin'
And the seed will grow
In the sands of time
From the darkest night
A new day is dawning
It's a long long way
To peace in our time 

Tell me where can we find
Peace in our - in our time
Where can we find
Peace in our time 

From a distant shore
Voices are crying
Can you hear them call
Are we gonna light their way
Salvation is the key
We have to keep tryin'
What we need right now
Peace in our time 

Tell me where can we find
Peace in our - in our time
Where can we find
Peace in our time 

Thank you for the chance
To light up the darkness
Leading the way
Show us to the promised land
Tear down these walls
That keep us imprisoned
What we're prayin' for
Is peace in our time 

Tell me where can we find
Peace in our - in our time
Where can we find
Peace in our time
