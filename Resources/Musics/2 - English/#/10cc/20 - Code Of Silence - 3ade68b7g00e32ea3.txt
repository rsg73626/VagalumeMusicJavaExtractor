CODE OF SILENCE

Deep in the night
I can hear you calling my name
How can I try to help you woman
If you go on hiding your pain
Baby, Baby, the tears on your pillow are real
You can't go on pretending to me
when I see the pain that you feel 

A code of silence, is a dreadful thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)
It's a deadly game (deadly game) 

Lost in your dreams
Trouble on your face in the pale moonlight
Nowhere to run you've got to let me know
Where you are standing tonight
Baby Baby Baby
I know that you're hurting inside
Open your heart
I know that we can make it
If you talk to me now 

A code of silence, is a deadly thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)
It's a deadly game (deadly game)....
