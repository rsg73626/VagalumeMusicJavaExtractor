AMERICAN PANORAMA

Martin Luther B.B. King
You had a dream and you make us swing
Doctor Winston J.F.K.
You had a dream but they blew you away
American panorama
Big apple rice banana
Bit but keep your backs against the wall
Pretzel logic does apply
Oh fast food junk food gets you by
You got delis diners southern fries
And burgen queens with hungry eyes
That's American panorama
Aerobatic instant karma
Run but do your jogging in the car
Tricky didn't make it
But his part deserves an oscar
When he proved that you can fool the people
all the time
And from the Rockies to the Hudson
Everybody loves a winner
Turn a blind eye to corruption
While the nation grows
Oh oh I feel the pressure rising
You're on top of the world but it's about to blow
Do you know what you're doing?
Do you know?
Take a look at what you've done
You are the shape of things to come
It's science fiction coming true
You can shoot the stars it's up to you
American panorama
Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true
Oh oh American panorama
Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true
