EVERYTHING IS NOT ENOUGH

It doesn't help you if you scream and shout
That isn't what this thing is all about
And do you really want to fight to win
You're missing out and that's another sin
Your dream of power is a sacrifice
Do you really want to pay that price
Just think about it and you'll change the pace
Look in the mirror tell me who do you face
Who is that?
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
Nobody loves you if you moan all day
So take it easy then you'll get your way
You ain't no dummy and I'm sure you know
You know it's better if you let it go
You're in control if you let it go
You're feeling better when you let it flow
You never really had to catch the moon
You're better jumping to another tune
So let's jump
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop (do, do, do it)
I've got it all but it's not enough
I keep thinking "Boy I feel so rough
This can't be me, I'm such a happy guy"
I laugh a lot but I want to cry
A cry for help is just letting go
It hurts a lot but I think I know
It's time for change I don't need the hype
It's time for change and the time is ripe
So let's go
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop...
